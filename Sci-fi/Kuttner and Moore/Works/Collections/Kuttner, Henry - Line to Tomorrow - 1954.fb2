   <p><emphasis>"Acknowledging. The initial steps have been accomplished. I am now fitted satisfactorily into the basic sociological pattern."</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>"Good. The contact is established. From time to time directions and guidance will be issued, Korys –"</emphasis></p>
   <p>The telephone rang. Fletcher kept his eyes shut and pretended not to hear it. He tried to recapture a rather pleasant dream, but the insistent shrilling would not stop. His time-sense was sufficiently warped by half-sleep so that the intervals between the rings seemed to stretch pleasantly into interminable minutes. Then <emphasis>tr-r-r-ranggg</emphasis>!</p>
   <p>Finally he slid out of bed, fumbled his way across the room and, after a brief altercation with the door, located the telephone. He picked it up and muttered an inarticulate something.</p>
   <p>"Korys," a voice said. "Is that you?"</p>
   <p>"Wrong number," Fletcher growled, but before he could replace the receiver, the voice went on.</p>
   <p>"Good. For a while I couldn't make contact. There was a temporal storm – at least, we <emphasis>think</emphasis> that was it – though it might have been the creebs shifting. You know how difficult it is to maintain a circuit like this – what took you so long to answer?"</p>
   <p>There was a long pause of dead silence. Fletcher, drunk with sleep, swayed on his feet, too drowsy to take the receiver from his ear.</p>
   <p>The voice said, "Couldn't hear me? That's odd. But you can now, eh? Well, you'd better start making notes for your thesis. Here's an instruction: Buy Transsteel now, sell in two days. That will give you currency for your needs."</p>
   <p>Silence. Then –</p>
   <p>"Yes. But remember to be unobtrusive. And don't felk the sorkins, if you can avoid it."</p>
   <p>The silence lengthened. Fletcher, murmuring something about practical jokes, hung up and went back to bed, where he managed to dream about felked sorkins. They looked rather like pickles dressed in gay red jackets, but their eyes were blue. By the time the creebs shifted – spidery creatures they were, rushing like lemmings down the beaches – Fletcher woke up with a headache and a mild hangover. Silently cursing his own imagination, he went feebly into the bathroom and revived himself with a cool shower. He shaved, arranged a makeshift breakfast, and read the morning newspaper. Transsteel, he noticed, was at 28¼.</p>
   <p>He went down to the advertising agency where he worked, made a few abortive passes at layouts, and had a stroke of good luck in dating Cynthia Dale, who wrote fashion and perfume copy. Cynthia was a lovely redhead, with expensive tastes and a capacity for liquor that Fletcher found surprising. They met after work and had dinner; Fletcher enjoyed himself thoroughly. A mild headache wore off in the course of the evening, and Cynthia unbent more than usual. He woke the next morning with a hazy memory of Cynthia's head on his shoulder and her husky voice reciting a list of synonyms for <emphasis>fragrant</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>"Aromatic," Fletcher suggested.</p>
   <p>"Shut up, Jerry. I've almost got the right word –"</p>
   <p>"So have I," Fletcher said, lifting his glass. "Nuts."</p>
   <p>This time the telephone didn't ring until eight A.M. By then Fletcher was downing coffee, carefully avoiding sudden motions. His head had been stuffed with moldy hay; not only could he taste it, but it had packed down inside his skull and felt awful. The sudden ringing sent lightening flashing behind Fletcher's eyes.</p>
   <p>"G-g-g … yeah," he said, lifting the receiver.</p>
   <p>"Good morning, Korys," the voice said brightly. "Though it's night here, of course. Did you buy the Transsteel?"</p>
   <p>"What kind of screwy gag is this?" Fletcher asked in thick fury. "I don't –"</p>
   <p>"Sell it tomorrow, then," the voice directed. "At a hundred and seven. How do you like the people?"</p>
   <p>"I hate the people!" Fletcher snarled, but apparently the other party didn't hear.</p>
   <p>"Coryza was fairly common then. If we could transport whole bodies, he could immunize them, but you've got to take the body you get – though we generally locate fairly healthy ones. If you'd been majoring in medicine, we might have chosen a diseased body for you, but since it's socio-economics with you –"</p>
   <p>Fletcher clicked the phone, but the connection wasn't broken. "– get rid of it," the voice said cheerfully. "Use this. It's a cure for coryza and several other minor things. One ounce sodium chloride, a pinch of baking soda –" It listed a few ingredients. "That should do it. Goodby, and good luck."</p>
   <p>"Gah," said Fletcher inarticulately. He decided to get in touch with the phone company if this continued. Having madmen call for one-sided conversations every morning was a depressing prospect. Even without a hangover. Reminded of the Armageddon in his head, Fletcher went into the kitchen looking for tomato juice. There wasn't any. Giddy nausea lurched through him as he straightened from the refrigerator. He could feel the creebs shifting. At least, it felt that way.</p>
   <p>He picked up the saltcellar and examined it thoughtfully. Sodium chloride. What the devil was that mixture the voice had recommended? Coryza – well, he didn't have a cold, but his head ached, his bones pained, and he was profoundly depressed. That stuff wouldn't kill him. He hoped.</p>
   <p>Fletcher had a slight tendency to hypochondria, stimulated, perhaps, by the increasing frequency of his headaches. Therefore he found it impossible to resist trying new remedies. The various ingredients were all available, but he had never heard of mixing such things together. It was green, it effervesced, and the taste was vile. Nevertheless Fletcher drank it, if only to stop the creebs.</p>
   <p>Ten seconds later he set down the glass and blinked at nothing. He shook his head experimentally.</p>
   <p>No creebs.</p>
   <p>It couldn't happen. An instantaneous cure for a monumental hangover was an obvious impossibility. But Fletcher's hangover was gone, headache and all. He felt fine.</p>
   <p>"I'll be damned," he said softly. Then he snatched for paper and pencil and jotted down the ingredients of the cure-all as a precaution against forgetfulness. He held up his hand and watched its steadiness with disbelieving eyes.</p>
   <p>Somebody had been very helpful.</p>
   <p>No one at the office would admit to telephoning Jerry Fletcher that morning. It had been a man's voice, he remembered, but Cynthia's husky tones might have been sufficiently deceptive. He asked her. She denied everything and seemed ill-tempered. Obviously if Cynthia knew the magical way of curing a hangover, she wouldn't have one now.</p>
   <p>There was, however, a newspaper on her desk, and Fletcher took it back with him to his office. The financial news interested him. But Transsteel had dropped three and a quarter points: it was at 25 now. And the general news didn't indicate that there would be any unexpected shift in supply and demand that would boost the stock overnight. Fletcher shrugged, decided to take the gifts the gods offered, and began to work on a layout for pretzels.</p>
   <p>The next morning the telephone rang again.</p>
   <p>The voice said, "Hello, Korys. Don't forget Transsteel. It'll drop before noon."</p>
   <p>Fletcher said, "Can you hear me?"</p>
   <p>"Well, in your own home – but don't let it out. The stuff's dangerous without a control. But it's fair enough, no reason why you shouldn't be comfortable. This is a field trip, not an initiation."</p>
   <p>"Hello … <emphasis>you</emphasis>! <emphasis>Korys!</emphasis>"</p>
   <p>"Then here's the equation." Fletcher reached for a pencil and copied rapidly as the voice dictated. He didn't know some of the technical terms, so he spelled them out. Mathematical symbols weren't up his alley.</p>
   <p>"Quite all right," the voice said cheerfully. "I'll expect a good thesis from you when you get back. Watch those sorkins, boy." There was a laugh and a faint click. Fletcher waited a moment, hung up, and began masticating his thumbnail.</p>
   <p>Then he called the telephone company and asked questions. They said they'd check up. Fletcher was beginning to think they wouldn't find anything amiss. That term <emphasis>field trip</emphasis> had switched his thought on to a new track. He re-examined the equation, but found no light there. Maybe –</p>
   <p>Abstractedly he dressed, gulped coffee, and went to the office. At noon he arranged to lunch with Dr. Sawtelle, a technician who worked for a huge commercial company that maintained an account with the advertising agency. Sawtelle was a skinny, gray-haired man with probing blue eyes.</p>
   <p>"Where'd you get it?" he wanted to know.</p>
   <p>"I'd rather not say just yet. All I want to know –"</p>
   <p>Sawtelle studied the equation. "But this is ridiculous. You can't … of course you can't!" He began talking about half-time and alloy properties, using a jargon that left Fletcher baffled.</p>
   <p>"Does it make sense?"</p>
   <p>"No," Sawtelle said. "At least … well, no. Look. I'd like to take this with me. I want to look up some references. It might mean something at that."</p>
   <p>"Copy it," Fletcher suggested. Sawtelle did so. And that ended the discussion, for the nonce.</p>
   <p>The newspaper listed Transsteel at 27½. That didn't make much sense either. Fletcher shrugged, finagled a date with Cynthia, and forgot the whole matter till he got back to his apartment shortly before dawn. He was very drunk, but the miraculous hangover-cure remedied that. He turned on the radio as he undressed.</p>
   <p>Presently it said, "– home of Dr. Andrew Sawtelle, research chemist. The building was totally destroyed by the blast. Entire family were killed –"</p>
   <p>Fletcher reached out, turned off the radio, and sat looking at nothing until the telephone rang.</p>
   <p>The voice was slightly distressed. "Haven't much time. Daki's in trouble. I knew when he flunked his pysch conditioning course … eh? Oh, felking the sorkins – naturally! So he's due to be burned at the stake unless – he <emphasis>would</emphasis> choose the Spanish Inquisition as his major. We could simply bring him back to this time, but it would mean a low mark for him. If I can get him out of it some other way, I will."</p>
   <p>Silence. Fletcher waited, his back and sides cool and wet.</p>
   <p>"Not important, no. Did the Transsteel – eh? Well, fifteen thousand was good money in those days. What? … Election bets. Yes. They were a social phenomenon in that time. Just a fleck; I've the reference here … Browning will be next president. Be careful not to win every wager, though. You don't want to arouse too much interest. You'll be graded on how unobtrusively you adjust to the social pattern, remember."</p>
   <p>Pause.</p>
   <p>"Exhibitionism isn't out of place in that era. You might arrange to lose an election bet, just to be on the safe side –" Silence again, then laughter. "Fine. Take him up on it. You'll look interesting riding a horse into the Waldorf-Astoria's lobby. Go ahead; you should learn about the normal eccentricities of the time, and certainly that's mild enough – you should spend a few days in 1986 some time and study the Lemming Craze – mass suicides, like the dancing manias of the Middle Ages. Go ahead and make the bet."</p>
   <p>Fletcher moistened his lips. His head was beginning to ache again. When the voice spoke after another pause, the subject had apparently been changed.</p>
   <p>"Fine. Embryo Korys is thriving. He'll be viable in two months. You must meet his mother some time. She used to visit the incubator every week till she was assigned to Polar Weather study. But I really haven't time, Korys, I must look after Daki. Good luck, boy."</p>
   <p><emphasis>Click.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Fletcher went out to the kitchen, found a bottle of rye, and sucked thirstily. He leaned against the sink and ran his palm slowly along cool green tile. It was solid and familiar. That made it worse, somehow. In an earthquake you expect the unusual. But not when the ground is solid under foot.</p>
   <p>President Browning –!</p>
   <p>Fifteen grand profit on Transsteel –!</p>
   <p>Where was Korys – and <emphasis>when</emphasis>?</p>
   <p>When Fletcher got to the office, he was somewhat tight and he hadn't wanted to use the hangover cure. Alcohol made a buffer. He played with layouts, but achieved little. Time slipped by unnoticed. Eventually Cynthia Dale appeared, fitting on a small, foolish hat and looking surprised.</p>
   <p>"You're a hound for work, Jerry," she said. "Aren't you going home?"</p>
   <p>"I can't," Fletcher said. "I felked the sorkins."</p>
   <p>"Try mixing them with soda," Cynthia suggested.</p>
   <p>He put his hands flat on the desk and stared owlishly up at her. "There isn't any. I've a bottle in the drawer here … have a drink?"</p>
   <p>"Not straight."</p>
   <p>"Then marry me. We can go and visit Embryo Fletcher every Sunday."</p>
   <p>"You need something," Cynthia said, firmly removing Fletcher from his chair, locating a hat, and lugging him to the elevator. "You need something strong and violent. You can take your choice between a drink and a Turkish bath. If you choose the latter, you'll be deprived of my company."</p>
   <p>"You see," Fletcher said carefully, his mouth cold and stiff, "Dr. Sawtelle blew himself up. All his family, too. Quite dead. I've got the equation in my pocket. I am also a murderer."</p>
   <p>He elaborated on this subject over a heavy slug of rye. The bartender, an experienced man, had mixed the drink with a licorice stick, so presently Fletcher became more coherent. Cynthia swam out of her fuzzy haze and became her usual charming, cool-eyed self.</p>
   <p>"So I called the telephone company again today," Fletcher explained. "There's nothing wrong. Nothing <emphasis>they</emphasis> can find out, anyhow."</p>
   <p>"So it's a gag."</p>
   <p>"Dr. Sawtelle wouldn't agree, if he could be reassembled. Look." Fletcher lit a cigarette and used the match to destroy a scrap of paper. "There goes the equation. I'm afraid to keep it now. The Voice mentioned that it was dangerous without a control, but he didn't say what the control was."</p>
   <p>"He?"</p>
   <p>"Sure. A tiny man with a head as big as a watermelon. He lives in the future. I got it all figured out. He's a university professor and he sends his students back into time on field trips."</p>
   <p>"With a field telephone, I suppose."</p>
   <p>"No, an ordinary phone. They have to keep it quiet. They've a way of tapping the wires – It's logical, isn't it? A telephone call is strictly personal, on a one-party line. But the creebs shifted. Somehow the wires got crossed. I can listen in on part of the conversation now. The Voice's part. But I can't hear Korys."</p>
   <p>"You're drunk. I don't believe a word of it." But Cynthia's eyes were troubled.</p>
   <p>"Korys," Fletcher went on, "is living in a time when a guy named Browning is running for President. And he'll be elected, too. That's why the Transsteel business didn't work with me. Korys is in the future. I don't know when. 1960 or 1970 or maybe later. Do you know a politician named Browning?"</p>
   <p>"I know a poet named Browning," Cynthia said, "but he's in the past."</p>
   <p>"Yes. He painted duchesses – What should I do?"</p>
   <p>"Have your phone number changed."</p>
   <p>"It might – Look, Cynthia, I'm afraid to do anything and I'm afraid not to do anything. I've got a direct line on the future. It's never happened before. It's an opportunity it says here. I ought to be able to clean up a million bucks or write a book or something."</p>
   <p>"Patent that hangover cure of yours."</p>
   <p>"But its limited. I can't ask questions. I can just listen in on what the Voice says. I can't trace down Korys because he's in the future, too. If I were sober, I wouldn't be this logical; my skepticism would be too strong. But why shouldn't I believe in Korys and the Voice when I can see the wallpaper crawling up to the ceiling, right across there."</p>
   <p>"That's subjective," Cynthia pointed out.</p>
   <p>"But what should I <emphasis>do</emphasis>?"</p>
   <p>The girl played with her glass. "If I believed you – which I don't – I'd say the lines of logic point to certain possibilities. As a copy-writer I know the rules of dramatic inevitability. Perhaps the Voice will learn you're listening in, and animate the telephone so it crawls down your throat and strangles you."</p>
   <p>"Uh!" Fletcher said.</p>
   <p>"Or he may send Korys back to kill you – or Embryo Korys."</p>
   <p>"I haven't done anything."</p>
   <p>"Well," Cynthia said, "here's another angle. In 1960 the Voice telephones you, and your name is Korys."</p>
   <p>"I hate paradoxes," Fletcher said firmly. "This isn't a story. I wish it were. I'd know what to do then. But in life you just fumble around, you're not sure. I'm not equipped to listen in on phone calls from the future."</p>
   <p>Cynthia's eyes were glowing. "Or you may be Korys yourself – with amnesia! And the Voice is really talking to you, though you don't know it."</p>
   <p>"Be quiet. Stop that. There'll be another call tomorrow morning –"</p>
   <p>"Don't answer it."</p>
   <p>"Ha!" Fletcher said scornfully, and there was a small silence.</p>
   <p>"You see," he went on presently, "I figure we take the future for granted, in an abstract sort of way. We expect there'll be super-stuff, but we know it'll come gradually. When it impinges concretely, we don't <emphasis>want</emphasis> it."</p>
   <p>"Afraid?"</p>
   <p>"Thoroughly afraid," Fletcher agreed. "The temptation's too great. I might copy some equation, try it out, and turn into a blob of protoplasm. There are too many unknown factors. And I'm not going to get myself hurt."</p>
   <p>"So?"</p>
   <p>"I'm going to keep my nose clean, that's all. Fairy gold!" He grinned crookedly. "I know what it would turn to. But I've got the answer. I'm not going to take anything they offer. I'm not going to cheat. All I'll do is listen in. No harm in that."</p>
   <p>"They might mention your death."</p>
   <p>"I know I'm going to die sometime. I'm ready. Death and taxes aren't both certain; the existence of one precludes the existence of the other – <emphasis>pro tem</emphasis>. As long as I just listen – as long as I don't try to conquer the world or build death rays – I'm O.K."</p>
   <p>"It reminds me of the old story about the guy who took a short cut through a haunted forest on Hallowe'en," Cynthia said. "He was thinking that he'd always been on the level, and if devils could get him just because he was in the forest, there just wasn't any justice."</p>
   <p>"And?"</p>
   <p>"And then a voice behind him said, 'there isn't,'" Cynthia said pleasantly. "That's all."</p>
   <p>"I run no risks," Fletcher declared.</p>
   <p>"And I haven't believed a word you've been saying. But it's a new line, anyhow. Pay for the drinks and let's go somewhere and eat."</p>
   <p>Fletcher reached for his wallet.</p>
   <p>Quite safe. He hadn't copied any of the instructions or equations the Voice dictated to Korys. Somewhere, in the misty abyss of the future, the Voice lived in his unimaginable world, checking his temporal maps as men today check spatial charts. There were test-tube babies and a rather incredible university and a Polar Weather Station. And Daki had been rescued from the Inquisition, by means of something the Voice referred to casually as a yofleec. "Yofleec is ceelfoy spelled backwards," Fletcher reflected. "Animal, vegetable, or mineral? I don't <emphasis>care</emphasis>!"</p>
   <p>His interest became purely impersonal; he had forced it into those channels. It was a tremendous relief to know that he wouldn't be tempted to steal from the future, as the unhappy Dr. Sawtelle had tried to do. There had been some hesitation about the hangover cure; it seemed harmless enough, but Fletcher wasn't sure about its possible toxic effects on a man of his era. It might eventually ossify him. He destroyed the recipe and refused to remember the ingredients.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, he followed the career of Korys with interest. These distorted glimpses into the future were fascinating. Remembering Cynthia's warning, he half expected the Voice to mention that a guy named Jerry Fletcher had been run down by a helicopter, but that never happened. The rules of inevitability didn't apply.</p>
   <p>Why should they? He wasn't interfering. He wasn't sticking his neck out. He was following paths of cold logic; a spectator at a play was seldom shot by one of the actors.</p>
   <p>John Wilkes Booth –</p>
   <p>This wasn't a play. It was a movie. The actors were removed by temporal distances. Nevertheless he never interrupted the Voice now, and was careful to lift and replace the receiver very gently.</p>
   <p>It went on for a month. Finally he learned that Korys was preparing to return to his original time-sector. The field work was almost completed. President Browning had been elected; the Dodgers had won the pennant; a lunar rocket base had been established. Fletcher wondered. 1960? 1970? Or later?</p>
   <p>Cynthia steadily refused to visit his apartment and listen to the Voice. She contended that it was just a line. "It's better than etchings," she admitted, "but it's a little too <emphasis>outré</emphasis> to be convincing." But Fletcher thought that Cynthia was less skeptical than she admitted.</p>
   <p>He didn't care. The affair would end soon, anyhow. His work at the office had not suffered; there was a raise and a promotion in sight, and his hypochondria had lapsed into a passive state. Occasionally he suspected his feeling of well-being and ate vitamin pills as a preventive measure, but not often.</p>
   <p>He hadn't even taken notes of the Voice's words. In a way, it was a taboo – the same principle as avoiding stepping on the cracks in the sidewalk, so it won't rain.</p>
   <p>"He should be leaving tomorrow," Fletcher told Cynthia one night at dinner.</p>
   <p>"Who?"</p>
   <p>"Korys, of course."</p>
   <p>"Good. Then you may stop talking about him. Unless you get a new bee in your bonnet. What do you expect next? A tame leprechaun?"</p>
   <p>Fletcher grinned. "I can't afford it."</p>
   <p>"They eat cream, don't they? I mean drink it."</p>
   <p>"Mine won't. He'll drink rye and like it."</p>
   <p>"I like this chicken cacciatore," Cynthia said, masticating. "If you promise to feed me this well all the time, I may reconsider my refusal to marry you."</p>
   <p>It was the most hopeful sign she had shown so far. Fletcher became immersed in daydreams. Later, on a roof garden, they paused between dances to stand at the parapet and look out over the great, glittering city. The immensity of the night was made larger by the lights below.</p>
   <p>"A rocket base on the Moon," Fletcher said softly.</p>
   <p>Cool winds brushed his cheek. He put his arm about Cynthia and drew her close. He was very glad, suddenly, that he had not stepped on the cracks in the sidewalk. He had taken no chances. The future – the unknown – was dangerous, because it <emphasis>was</emphasis> the unknown.</p>
   <p>And that peril could lie fearfully close. Here, now – two steps could carry him to the top of the parapet and over. Luckily men were conditioned against taking those two steps.</p>
   <p>"It's cold," he said. "Let's go in, Cynthia. We don't want pneumonia – especially now."</p>
   <p>The telephone rang. Fletcher had awakened with another headache this morning. Probably a hangover. He put down his cigarette in an ashtray and gently lifted the receiver. This might be the last call.</p>
   <p>The Voice said, "All ready, Korys?"</p>
   <p>Pause.</p>
   <p>"Half an hour, then. But what caused the delay?"</p>
   <p>Another, longer pause.</p>
   <p>"Oh, really? I must make a note of that. But neuroses were common in that time. There was a touch of it in Embryo Korys, you know, but it was ironed out. Incidentally, his mother is on furlough. You'll be able to meet her in a few hours – But about this man. He knew who you were?"</p>
   <p>Pause.</p>
   <p>"I don't see how he <emphasis>could</emphasis> have known. Or located you. If he was as incoherent as all that, he shouldn't have been outside a sanatorium. What was his name?"</p>
   <p>Pause.</p>
   <p>"Fletcher. Gerald Fletcher? I'll check, but I'm sure there's no record. He's not one of <emphasis>ours</emphasis>. Too bad. Had he escaped from a sanatorium or … Oh, I see. Well, he's in safe hands now, I suppose. Yes, a mental sanatorium they called it in those days, your research hasn't covered the medical field – such as it was! Curious that he should have known you. I can't understand –"</p>
   <p>Pause.</p>
   <p>"Called you by name? Not <emphasis>Korys</emphasis>? Really. How could he possibly have known? This is very interesting indeed. Just when did he first appear?"</p>
   <p>Pause.</p>
   <p>"Crowded – well, naturally. Riding a horse into the Waldorf-Astoria isn't done every day. But I told you there'd be no trouble; every paid off eccentric election bet in those days – Well, if he actually dragged you off the horse and called you by name – it's very curious. Obviously he was mad, but how he knew – No, it couldn't be ESP, could it? There's no actual evidence that the insane are more sensitive than – What did you find out about him?"</p>
   <p>Pause.</p>
   <p>"I see. Anxiety neurosis, of course, at the start. Something was bothering him – dread of the future, perhaps; that's common enough in such cases. The doctors said … oh! Then he had escaped from a sanatorium. That sort of thing was interesting – probably started as nothing but hypochondria – built on some recurrent ailment, headaches or – Anyhow, it could increase over a long period into a genuine psychosis. How old a man was he?"</p>
   <p>The humming void held only silence. And presently –</p>
   <p>"Um-m-m. Typical, I'd say, at that age. Nothing we can do now, though – it's a pity. The man's hopelessly insane. It would be interesting to know what it was that set him off on the wrong track originally. I wonder what a man of that time and that type would worry about enough to drive him off balance? Such things start from a basis of hypochondria often enough, as you've described it, but why was he so <emphasis>sure</emphasis> he was going to become insane? Naturally, if you're convinced you're becoming psychotic and brood over it for years – well! Still, we can discuss the case in more detail personally. Half an hour, then?"</p>
   <p>Pause.</p>
   <p>"Fine. I'm glad you didn't felk the sorkins, boy!" The Voice laughed jovially. There was a click.</p>
   <p>Fletcher watched his hand move forward and drop the receiver into its black cradle.</p>
   <p>He felt the walls close in.</p>

    <p>A GNOME THERE WAS</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Tim Crockett should never have sneaked into the mine on Dornsef Mountain. What is winked at in California may have disastrous results in the coal mines of Pennsylvania. Especially when gnomes are involved.</p>
   <p>Not that Tim Crockett knew about the gnomes. He was just investigating conditions among the lower classes, to use his own rather ill-chosen words. He was one of a group of southern Californians who had decided that labor needed them. They were wrong. They needed labor – at least eight hours of it a day.</p>
   <p>Crockett, like his colleagues, considered the laborer a combination of a gorilla and The Man with the Hoe, probably numbering the Kallikaks among his ancestors. He spoke fierily of down-trodden minorities, wrote incendiary articles for the group's organ, <emphasis>Earth</emphasis>, and deftly maneuvered himself out of entering his father's law office as a clerk. He had, he said, a mission. Unfortunately, he got little sympathy from either the workers or their oppressors.</p>
   <p>A psychologist could have analyzed Crockett easily enough. He was a tall, thin, intense-looking young man, with rather beady little eyes, and a nice taste in neckties. All he needed was a vigorous kick in the pants.</p>
   <p>But definitely not administered by a gnome!</p>
   <p>He was junketing through the country, on his father's money, investigating labor conditions, to the profound annoyance of such laborers as he encountered. It was with this idea in mind that he surreptitiously got into the Ajax coal mine – or, at least, one shaft of it – after disguising himself as a miner and rubbing his face well with black dust. Going down in the lift, he looked singularly untidy in the midst of a group of well-scrubbed faces. Miners look dirty only after a day's work.</p>
   <p>Dornsef Mountain is honeycombed, but not with the shafts of the Ajax Company. The gnomes have ways of blocking their tunnels when humans dig too close. The whole place was a complete confusion to Crockett. He let himself drift along with the others, till they began to work. A filled car rumbled past on its tracks. Crockett hesitated, and then sidled over to a husky specimen who seemed to have the marks of a great sorrow stamped on his face.</p>
   <p>"Look," he said, "I want to talk to you."</p>
   <p>"Inglis?" asked the other inquiringly. "Viskey. Chin. Vine. Hell." Having thus demonstrated his somewhat incomplete command of English, he bellowed hoarsely with laughter and returned to work, ignoring the baffled Crockett, who turned away to find another victim. But this section of the mine seemed deserted. Another loaded car rumbled past, and Crockett decided to see where it came from. He found out, after banging his head painfully and falling flat at least five times.</p>
   <p>It came from a hole in the wall. Crockett entered it, and simultaneously heard a hoarse cry from behind him. The unknown requested Crockett to come back.</p>
   <p>"So I can break your slab-sided neck," he promised, adding a stream of sizzling profanity. "Come outa there!"</p>
   <p>Crockett cast one glance back, saw a gorillalike shadow lurching after him, and instantly decided that his stratagem had been discovered. The owners of the Ajax mine had sent a strong-arm man to murder him – or, at least, to beat him to a senseless pulp. Terror lent wings to Crockett's flying feet. He rushed on, frantically searching for a side tunnel in which he might lose himself. The bellowing from behind re-echoed against the walls. Abruptly Crockett caught a significant sentence clearly.</p>
   <p>"– before that dynamite goes off!"</p>
   <p>It was at that exact moment that the dynamite went off.</p>
   <p>Crockett, however, did not know it. He discovered, quite briefly, that he was flying. Then he was halted, with painful suddenness, by the roof. After that he knew nothing at all, till he recovered to find a head regarding him steadfastly.</p>
   <p>It was not a comforting sort of head – not one at which you would instinctively clutch for companionship. It was, in fact, a singularly odd, if not actually revolting, head. Crockett was too much engrossed with staring at it to realize that he was actually seeing in the dark.</p>
   <p>How long had he been unconscious? For some obscure reason Crockett felt that it had been quite a while. The explosion had – what?</p>
   <p>Buried him here behind a fallen roof of rock? Crockett would have felt little better had he known that he was in a used-up shaft, valueless now, which had been abandoned long since. The miners, blasting to open a new shaft, had realized that the old one would be collapsed, but that didn't matter.</p>
   <p>Except to Tim Crockett.</p>
   <p>He blinked, and when he reopened his eyes, the head had vanished. This was a relief. Crockett immediately decided the unpleasant thing had been a delusion. Indeed, it was difficult to remember what it had looked like. There was only a vague impression of a turnip-shaped outline, large, luminous eyes, and an incredibly broad slit of a mouth.</p>
   <p>Crockett sat up, groaning. Where was this curious silvery radiance coming from? It was like daylight on a foggy afternoon, coming from nowhere in particular, and throwing no shadows. "Radium," thought Crockett, who knew very little of mineralogy.</p>
   <p>He was in a shaft that stretched ahead into dimness till it made a sharp turn perhaps fifty feet away. Behind him – behind him the roof had fallen. Instantly Crockett began to experience difficulty in breathing. He flung himself upon the rubbly mound, tossing rocks frantically here and there, gasping and making hoarse, inarticulate noises.</p>
   <p>He became aware, presently, of his hands. His movements slowed till he remained perfectly motionless, in a half-crouching posture, glaring at the large, knobbly, and surprising objects that grew from his wrists. Gould he, during his period of unconsciousness, have acquired mittens? Even as the thought came to him, Crockett realized that no mittens ever knitted resembled in the slightest degree what he had a right to believe to be his hands. They twitched slightly.</p>
   <p>Possibly they were caked with mud – no. It wasn't that. His hands had altered. They were huge, gnarled, brown objects, like knotted oak roots. Sparse black hairs sprouted on their backs. The nails were definitely in need of a manicure – preferably with a chisel.</p>
   <p>Crockett looked down at himself. He made soft cheeping noises, indicative of disbelief. He had squat bow legs, thick and strong, and no more than two feet long – less, if anything. Uncertain with disbelief, Crockett explored his body. It had changed – certainly not for the better.</p>
   <p>He was slightly more than four feet high, and about three feet wide, with a barrel chest, enormous splay feet, stubby thick legs, and no neck whatsoever. He was wearing red sandals, blue shorts, and a red tunic which left his lean but sinewy arms bare. His head –</p>
   <p>Turnip-shaped. The mouth –</p>
   <p>Yipe! Crockett had inadvertently put his fist clear into it. He withdrew the offending hand instantly, stared around in a dazed fashion, and collapsed on the ground. It couldn't be happening. It was quite impossible. Hallucinations. He was dying of asphyxiation, and delusions were preceding his death.</p>
   <p>Crockett shut his eyes, again convinced that his lungs were laboring for breath. "I'm dying," he said. "I c-can't breathe."</p>
   <p>A contemptuous voice said, "I hope you don't think you're breathing <emphasis>air</emphasis>!"</p>
   <p>"I'm n-not –" Crockett didn't finish the sentence. His eyes popped again. He was hearing things.</p>
   <p>He heard it again. "You're a singularly lousy specimen of gnome," the voice said. "But under Nid's law we can't pick and choose. Still, you won't be put to digging hard metals, I can see that. Anthracite's about your speed. What're you staring at? You're <emphasis>very</emphasis> much uglier than I am."</p>
   <p>Crockett, endeavoring to lick his dry lips, was horrified to discover the end of his moist tongue dragging limply over his eyes. He whipped it back, with a loud smacking noise, and managed to sit up. Then he remained perfectly motionless, staring.</p>
   <p>The head had reappeared. This time there was a body under it.</p>
   <p>"I'm Gru Magru," said the head chattily. "You'll be given a gnomic name, of course, unless your own is guttural enough. What is it?"</p>
   <p>"Crockett," the man responded, in a stunned, automatic manner.</p>
   <p>"Hey?"</p>
   <p>"Crockett."</p>
   <p>"Stop making noises like a frog and – oh, I see. Crockett. Fair enough. Now get up and follow me or I'll kick the pants off you."</p>
   <p>But Crockett did not immediately rise. He was watching Gru Magru – obviously a gnome. Short, squat and stunted, the being's figure resembled a bulging little barrel, topped by an inverted turnip. The hair grew up thickly to a peak – the root, as it were. In the turnip face was a loose, immense slit of a mouth, a button of a nose, and two very large eyes.</p>
   <p>"Get <emphasis>up</emphasis>!" Gru Magru said.</p>
   <p>This time Crockett obeyed, but the effort exhausted him completely. If he moved again, he thought, he would go mad. It would be just as well. Gru Magru planted a large splay foot where it would do the most good, and Crockett described an arc which ended at a jagged boulder fallen from the roof. "Get up," the gnome said, with gratuitous bad temper, "or I'll kick you again. It's bad enough to have an outlying prospect patrol, where I might run into a man any time, without – <emphasis>Up!</emphasis> Or –"</p>
   <p>Crockett got up. Gru Magru took his arm and impelled him into the depths of the tunnel.</p>
   <p>"Well, you're a gnome now," he said. "It's the Nid law. Sometimes I wonder if it's worth the trouble. But I suppose it is – since gnomes can't propagate, and the average population has to be kept up somehow."</p>
   <p>"I want to die," Crockett said wildly.</p>
   <p>Gru Magru laughed. "Gnomes <emphasis>can't</emphasis> die. They're immortal, till the Day. Judgment Day, I mean."</p>
   <p>"You're not logical," Crockett pointed out, as though by disproving one factor he could automatically disprove the whole fantastic business. "You're either flesh and blood and have to die eventually, or you're not, and then you're not real."</p>
   <p>"Oh, we're flesh and blood, right enough," Gru Magru said. "But we're not mortal. There's a distinction. Not that I've anything against some mortals," he hastened to explain. "Bats, now – and owls – they're fine. But men!" He shuddered. "No gnome can stand the sight of a man."</p>
   <p>Crockett clutched at a straw. "I'm a man."</p>
   <p>"You were, you mean," Gru said. "Not a very good specimen, either, for my ore. But you're a gnome now. It's the Nid law."</p>
   <p>"You keep talking about the Nid law," Crockett complained.</p>
   <p>"Of course you don't understand," said Gru Magru, in a patronizing fashion. "It's this way. Back in ancient times, it was decreed that if any humans got lost in underearth, a tithe of them would be transformed into gnomes. The first gnome emperor, Podrang the Third, arranged that. He saw that fairies could kidnap human children and keep them, and spoke to the authorities about it. Said it was unfair. So when miners and such-like are lost underneath, a tithe of them are transformed into gnomes and join us. That's what happened to you. See?"</p>
   <p>"No," Crockett said weakly. "Look. You said Podrang was the first gnome emperor. Why was he called Podrang the Third?"</p>
   <p>"No time for questions," Gru Magru snapped. "Hurry!"</p>
   <p>He was almost running now, dragging the wretched Crockett after him. The new gnome had not yet mastered his rather unusual limbs, and, due to the extreme wideness of his sandals, he trod heavily on his right hand, but after that learned to keep his arms bent and close to his sides. The walls, illuminated with that queer silvery radiance, spun past dizzily.</p>
   <p>"W-what's that light?" Crockett managed to gasp. "Where's it coming from?"</p>
   <p>"Light?" Gru Magru inquired. "It isn't light."</p>
   <p>"Well, it isn't dark –"</p>
   <p>"Of course it's dark," the gnome snapped. "How could we see if it wasn't dark?"</p>
   <p>There was no possible answer to this, except, Crockett thought wildly, a frantic shriek. And he needed all his breath for running. They were in a labyrinth now, turning and twisting and doubling through innumerable tunnels, and Crockett knew he could never retrace his steps. He regretted having left the scene of the cave-in. But how could he have helped doing so?</p>
   <p>"Hurry!" Gru Magru urged. "Hurry!"</p>
   <p>"Why?" Crockett got out breathlessly.</p>
   <p>"There's a fight going on!" the gnome said.</p>
   <p>Just then they rounded a corner and almost blundered into the fight. A seething mass of gnomes filled the tunnel, battling with frantic fury. Red and blue pants and tunics moved in swift patchwork frenzy; turnip heads popped up and down vigorously. It was apparently a free-for-all.</p>
   <p>"See!" Gru gloated. "A fight! I could smell it six tunnels away. Oh, a beauty!" He ducked as a malicious-looking little gnome sprang out of the huddle to seize a rock and hurl it with vicious accuracy. The missile missed its mark, and Gru, neglecting his captive, immediately hurled himself upon the little gnome, bore him down on the cave floor, and began to beat his head against it. Both parties shrieked at the tops of their voices, which were lost in the deafening din that resounded through the tunnel.</p>
   <p>"Oh – my," Crockett said weakly. He stood staring, which was a mistake. A very large gnome emerged from the pile, seized Crockett by the feet, and threw him away. The terrified inadvertent projectile sailed through the tunnel to crash heavily into something which said, "<emphasis>Whoo-doof!</emphasis>" There was a tangle of malformed arms and legs.</p>
   <p>Crockett arose to find that he had downed a vicious-looking gnome with flaming red hair and four large diamond buttons on his tunic. This repulsive creature lay motionless, out for the count. Crockett took stock of his injuries – there were none. His new body was hardy, anyway.</p>
   <p>"You saved me!" said a new voice. It belonged to a lady gnome. Crockett decided that if there was anything uglier than a gnome, it was the female of the species. The creature stood crouching just behind him, clutching a large rock in one capable hand.</p>
   <p>Crockett ducked.</p>
   <p>"I won't hurt you," the other howled above the din that filled the passage. "You saved me! Mugza was trying to pull my ears off – oh! He's waking up!"</p>
   <p>The red-haired gnome was indeed recovering consciousness. His first act was to draw up his feet and, without rising, kick Crockett clear across the tunnel. The feminine gnome immediately sat on Mugza's chest and pounded his head with the rock till he subsided.</p>
   <p>Then she arose. "You're not hurt? Good! I'm Brockle Buhn ... Oh, look! He'll have his head off in a minute!"</p>
   <p>Crockett turned to see that his erstwhile guide, Gru Magru, was gnomefully tugging at the head of an unidentified opponent, attempting, apparently, to twist it clear off. "What's it all about?" Crockett howled. "Uh – Brockle Buhn! <emphasis>Brockle Buhn!</emphasis>"</p>
   <p>She turned unwillingly. "What?"</p>
   <p>"The fight! What started it?"</p>
   <p>"I did," she explained. "I said, 'Let's have a fight'."</p>
   <p>"Oh, that was all?"</p>
   <p>"Then we started." Brockle Buhn nodded. "What's your name?"</p>
   <p>"Crockett."</p>
   <p>"You're new here, aren't you? Oh – I know. You were a human being!" Suddenly a new light appeared in her bulging eyes. "Crockett, maybe you can tell me something. What's a kiss?"</p>
   <p>"A – kiss?" Crockett repeated, in a baffled manner.</p>
   <p>"Yes. I was listening inside a knoll once, and heard two human beings talking – male and female, by their voices. I didn't dare look at them, of course, but the man asked the woman for a kiss."</p>
   <p>"Oh," Crockett said, rather blankly. "He asked for a kiss, eh?"</p>
   <p>"And then there was a smacking noise and the woman said it was wonderful. I've wondered ever since. Because if any gnome asked me for a kiss, I wouldn't know what he meant."</p>
   <p>"Gnomes don't kiss?" Crockett asked in a perfunctory way. "Gnomes dig," said Brockle Buhn. "And we eat. I like to eat. Is a kiss like mud soup?"</p>
   <p>"Well, not exactly." Somehow Crockett managed to explain the mechanics of osculation.</p>
   <p>The gnome remained silent, pondering deeply. At last she said, with the air of one bestowing mud soup upon a hungry applicant, "I'll give you a kiss."</p>
   <p>Crockett had a nightmare picture of his whole head being engulfed in that enormous maw. He backed away. "N-no," he got out. "I – I'd rather not."</p>
   <p>"Then let's fight," said Brockle Buhn, without rancor, and swung a knotted fist which smacked painfully athwart Crockett's ear. "Oh, no," she said regretfully, turning away. "The fight's over. It wasn't very long, was it?"</p>
   <p>Crockett, rubbing his mangled ear, saw that in every direction gnomes were picking themselves up and hurrying off about their business. They seemed to have forgotten all about the recent conflict. The tunnel was once more silent, save for the pad-padding of gnomes' feet on the rock. Gru Magru came over, grinning happily.</p>
   <p>"Hello, Brockle Buhn," he greeted. "A good fight. Who's this?" He looked down at the prostrate body of Mugza, the red-haired gnome.</p>
   <p>"Mugza," said Brockle Buhn. "He's still out. Let's kick him."</p>
   <p>They proceeded to do it with vast enthusiasm, while Crockett watched and decided never to allow himself to be knocked unconscious. It definitely wasn't safe. At last, however, Gru Magru tired of the sport and took Crockett by the arm again. "Come along," he said, and they sauntered along the tunnel, leaving Brockle Buhn jumping up and down on the senseless Mugza's stomach.</p>
   <p>"You don't seem to mind hitting people when they're knocked out," Crockett hazarded.</p>
   <p>"It's <emphasis>much</emphasis> more fun," Gru said happily. "That way you can tell just where you want to hit 'em. Come along. You'll have to be inducted. Another day, another gnome. Keeps the population stable," he explained, and fell to humming a little song.</p>
   <p>"Look," Crockett said. "I just thought of something. You say human beings are turned into gnomes to keep the population stable. But if gnomes don't die, doesn't that mean that there are more gnomes now than ever? The population keeps rising, doesn't it?"</p>
   <p>"Be still," Gru Magru commanded. "I'm singing."</p>
   <p>It was a singularly tuneless song. Crockett, his thoughts veering madly, wondered if the gnomes had a national anthem. Probably "Rock Me to Sleep." Oh, well.</p>
   <p>"We're going to see the Emperor," Gru said at last. "He always sees the new gnomes. You'd better make a good impression, or he'll put you to placer-mining lava."</p>
   <p>Crockett glanced down at his grimy tunic. "Hadn't I better clean up a bit? That fight made me a mess."</p>
   <p>"It wasn't the fight," Gru said insultingly. "What's wrong with you, anyway? I don't see anything amiss."</p>
   <p>"My clothes – they're dirty."</p>
   <p>"Don't worry about that," said the other. "It's good filthy dirt, isn't it? Here!" He halted, and, stooping, seized a handful of dust, which he rubbed into Crockett's face and hair. "That'll fix you up."</p>
   <p>"I – pffht! ... Thanks ... <emphasis>pffht,</emphasis>" said the newest gnome. "I hope I'm dreaming. Because if I'm not –" He didn't finish. Crockett was feeling unwell.</p>
   <p>They went through a labyrinth, far under Dornsef Mountain, and emerged at last in a bare, huge chamber with a throne of rock at one end of it. A small gnome was sitting on the throne paring his toenails. "Bottom of the day to you," Gru said. "Where's the Emperor?"</p>
   <p>"Taking a bath," said the other. "I hope he drowns. Mud, mud, mud – morning, noon and night. First it's too hot. Then it's too cold. Then it's too thick. I work my fingers to the bone mixing his mud baths, and all I get is a kick," the small gnome continued plaintively. "There's such a thing as being <emphasis>too</emphasis> dirty. Three mud baths a day – that's carrying it too far. And never a thought for me! Oh, no. I'm a mud puppy, that's what I am. He called me that today. Said there were lumps in the mud. Well, why not? That damned loam we've been getting is enough to turn a worm's stomach. You'll find His Majesty in there," the little gnome finished, jerking his foot toward an archway in the wall.</p>
   <p>Crockett was dragged into the next room, where, in a sunken bath filled with steaming, brown mud, a very fat gnome sat, only his eyes discernible through the oozy coating that covered him. He was filling his hands with mud and letting it drip over his head, chuckling in a senile sort of way as he did so.</p>
   <p>"Mud," he remarked pleasantly to Gru Magru, in a voice like a lion's bellow. "Nothing like it. Good rich mud. <emphasis>Ah!</emphasis>"</p>
   <p>Gru was bumping his head on the floor, his large, capable hand around Crockett's neck forcing the other to follow suit.</p>
   <p>"Oh, get up," said the Emperor. "What's this? What's this gnome been up to? Out with it."</p>
   <p>"He's new," Gru explained. "I found him topside. The Nid law, you know."</p>
   <p>"Yes, of course. Let's have a look at you. Ugh! I'm Podrang the Second, Emperor of the Gnomes. What have you to say to that?"</p>
   <p>All Crockett could think of was: "How – how can you be Podrang the Second? I thought Podrang the Third was the first emperor."</p>
   <p>"A chatterbox," said Podrang II, disappearing beneath the surface of the mud and spouting as he rose again. "Take care of him, Gru. Easy work at first. Digging anthracite. Mind you don't eat any while you're on the job," he cautioned the dazed Crockett. "After you've been here a century, you're allowed one mud bath a day. Nothing like 'em," he added, bringing up a gluey handful to smear over his face.</p>
   <p>Abruptly he stiffened. His lion's bellow rang out.</p>
   <p>"Drook! <emphasis>Drook!</emphasis>"</p>
   <p>The little gnome Crockett had seen in the throne room scurried in, wringing his hands. "Your Majesty! Isn't the mud warm enough?"</p>
   <p>"You crawling blob!" roared Podrang II. "You slobbering, offspring of six thousand individual offensive stenches! You mica-eyed, incompetent, draggle-eared, writhing blot on the good name of gnomes! You geological mistake! You – you –"</p>
   <p>Drook took advantage of his master's temporary inarticulacy. "It's the best mud, Your Majesty! I refined it myself. Oh, Your Majesty, what's wrong?"</p>
   <p>"There's a worm in it!" His Majesty bellowed, and launched into a stream of profanity so horrendous that it practically made the mud boil. Clutching his singed ears, Crockett allowed Gru Magru to drag him away.</p>
   <p>"I'd like to get the old boy in a fight," Gru remarked, when they were safely in the depths of a tunnel, "but he'd use magic, of course. That's the way he is. Best emperor we've ever had. Not a scrap of fair play in his bloated body."</p>
   <p>"Oh," Crockett said blankly. "Well, what next?"</p>
   <p>"You heard Podrang, didn't you? You dig anthracite. And if you eat any, I'll kick your teeth in."</p>
   <p>Brooding over the apparent bad tempers of gnomes, Crockett allowed himself to be conducted to a gallery where dozens of gnomes, both male and female, were using picks and mattocks with furious vigor. "This is it," Gru said. "Now! You dig anthracite. You work twenty hours, and then sleep six."</p>
   <p>"Then what?"</p>
   <p>"Then you start digging again," Gru explained. "You have a brief rest once every ten hours. You mustn't stop digging in between, unless it's for a fight. Now, here's the way you locate coal. Just think of it."</p>
   <p>"Eh?"</p>
   <p>"How do you think I found you?" Gru asked impatiently. "Gnomes have – certain senses. There's a legend that fairy folk can locate water by using a forked stick. Well, we're attracted to metals. Think of anthracite," he finished, and Crockett obeyed. Instantly he found himself turning to the wall of the tunnel nearest him.</p>
   <p>"See how it works?" Gru grinned. "It's a natural evolution, I suppose. Functional. We have to know where the underneath deposits are, so the authorities gave us this sense when we were created. Think of ore – or any deposit in the ground – and you'll be attracted to it. Just as there's a repulsion in all gnomes against daylight."</p>
   <p>"Eh?" Crockett started slightly. "What was that?"</p>
   <p>"Negative and positive. We need ores, so we're attracted to them. Daylight is harmful to us, so if we think we're getting too close to the surface, we think of light, and it repels us. Try it!"</p>
   <p>Crockett obeyed. Something seemed to be pressing down the top of his head.</p>
   <p>"Straight up," Gru nodded. "But it's a long way. I saw daylight once. And – a man, too." He stared at the other. "I forgot to explain. Gnomes can't stand the sight of human beings. They – well, there's a limit to how much ugliness a gnome can look at. Now you're one of us, you'll feel the same way. Keep away from daylight, and never look at a man. It's as much as your sanity is worth."</p>
   <p>There was a thought stirring in Crockett's mind. He could, then, find his way out of this maze of tunnels, simply by employing his new sense to lead him to daylight. After that – well, at least he would be above ground.</p>
   <p>Gru Magru shoved Crockett into a place between two busy gnomes and thrust a pick into his hands. "There. Get to work."</p>
   <p>"Thanks for –" Crockett began, when Gru suddenly kicked him and then took his departure, humming happily to himself. Another gnome came up, saw Crockett standing motionless, and told him to get busy, accompanying the command with a blow on his already tender ear. Perforce Crockett seized the pick and began to chop anthracite out of the wall.</p>
   <p>"Crockett!" said a familiar voice. "It's you! I thought they'd send you here."</p>
   <p>It was Brockle Buhn, the feminine gnome Crockett had already encountered. She was swinging a pick with the others, but dropped it now to grin at her companion.</p>
   <p>"You won't be here long," she consoled. "Ten years or so. Unless you run into trouble, and then you'll be put at really hard work."</p>
   <p>Crockett's arms were already aching. "<emphasis>Hard</emphasis> work! My arms are going to fall off in a minute."</p>
   <p>He leaned on his pick. "Is this your regular job?"</p>
   <p>"Yes – but I'm seldom here. Usually I'm being punished. I'm a troublemaker, I am. I eat anthracite."</p>
   <p>She demonstrated, and Crockett shuddered at the audible crunching sound. Just then the overseer came up. Brockle Buhn swallowed hastily.</p>
   <p>"What's this?" he snarled. "Why aren't you at work?"</p>
   <p>"We were just going to fight," Brockle Buhn explained.</p>
   <p>"Oh – just the two of you? Or can I join in?"</p>
   <p>"Free for all," the unladylike gnome offered, and struck the unsuspecting Crockett over the head with her pick. He went out like a light.</p>
   <p>Awakening some time later, he investigated bruised ribs and decided Brockle Buhn must have kicked him after he'd lost consciousness. What a gnome! Crockett sat up, finding himself in the same tunnel, dozens of gnomes busily digging anthracite.</p>
   <p>The overseer came toward him. "Awake, eh? Get to work!"</p>
   <p>Dazedly Crockett obeyed. Brockle Buhn flashed him a delighted grin. "You missed it. I got an ear – see?" She exhibited it. Crockett hastily lifted an exploring hand. It wasn't his.</p>
   <p>Dig ... dig ... dig ... the hours dragged past. Crockett had never worked so hard in his life. But, he noticed, not a gnome complained. Twenty hours of toil, with one brief rest period – he'd slept through that. Dig ... dig ... dig.</p>
   <p>Without ceasing her work, Brockle Buhn said, "I think you'll make a good gnome, Crockett. You're toughening up already. Nobody'd ever believe you were once a man."</p>
   <p>"Oh – no?"</p>
   <p>"No. What were you, a miner?"</p>
   <p>"I was –" Crockett paused suddenly. A curious light came into his eyes.</p>
   <p>"I was a labor organizer," he finished.</p>
   <p>"That's that?"</p>
   <p>"Ever heard of a union?" Crockett asked, his gaze intent.</p>
   <p>"Is it an ore?" Brockle Buhn shook her head. "No, I've never heard of it. What's a union?"</p>
   <p>Crockett explained. No genuine labor organizer would have accepted that explanation. It was, to say the least, biased.</p>
   <p>Brockle Buhn seemed puzzled. "I don't see what you mean, exactly, but I suppose it's all right."</p>
   <p>"Try another tack," Crockett said. "Don't you ever get tired of working twenty hours a day?"</p>
   <p>"Sure. Who wouldn't?"</p>
   <p>"Then why do it?"</p>
   <p>"We always have," Brockle Buhn said indulgently. "We can't stop."</p>
   <p>"Suppose you did?"</p>
   <p>"I'd be punished – beaten with stalactites, or something."</p>
   <p>"Suppose you all did," Crockett insisted. "Every damn gnome. Suppose you had a sit-down strike."</p>
   <p>"You're crazy," Brockle Buhn said. "Such a thing's never happened. It – it's <emphasis>human</emphasis>."</p>
   <p>"Kisses never happened underground, either," said Crockett. "No, I don't want one! And I don't want to fight, either. Good heavens, let me get the set-up here. Most of the gnomes work to support the privileged classes."</p>
   <p>"No. We just work."</p>
   <p>"But why?"</p>
   <p>"We always have. And the Emperor wants us to."</p>
   <p>"Has the Emperor ever worked?" Crockett demanded, with an air of triumph. "No! He just takes mud baths! Why shouldn't every gnome have the same privilege? Why –"</p>
   <p>He talked on, at great length, as he worked. Brockle Buhn listened with increasing interest. And eventually she swallowed the bait – hook, line and sinker.</p>
   <p>An hour later she was nodding agreeably. "I'll pass the word along. Tonight. In the Roaring Cave. Right after work."</p>
   <p>"Wait a minute," Crockett objected. "How many gnomes can we get?"</p>
   <p>"Well – not very many. Thirty?"</p>
   <p>"We'll have to organize first. We'll need a definite plan."</p>
   <p>Brockle Buhn went off at a tangent. "Let's fight."</p>
   <p>"No! Will you listen? We need a – a council. Who's the worst trouble-maker here?"</p>
   <p>"Mugza, I think," she said. "The red-haired gnome you knocked out when he hit me."</p>
   <p>Crockett frowned slightly. Would Mugza hold a grudge? Probably not, he decided. Or, rather, he'd be no more ill tempered than other gnomes. Mugza might attempt to throttle Crockett on sight, but he'd no doubt do the same to any other gnome. Besides, as Brockle Buhn went on to explain, Mugza was the gnomic equivalent of a duke. His support would be valuable.</p>
   <p>"And Gru Magru," she suggested. "He loves new things, especially if they make trouble."</p>
   <p>"Yeah." These were not the two Crockett would have chosen, but at least he could think of no other candidates. "If we could get somebody who's close to the Emperor ... What about Drook – the guy who gives Podrang his mud baths?"</p>
   <p>"Why not? I'll fix it." Brockle Buhn lost interest and surreptitiously began to eat anthracite. Since the overseer was watching, this resulted in a violent quarrel, from which Crockett emerged with a black eye. Whispering profanity under his breath, he went back to digging.</p>
   <p>But he had time for a few more words with Brockle Buhn. She'd arrange it. That night there would be a secret meeting of the conspirators.</p>
   <p>Crockett had been looking forward to exhausted slumber, but this chance was too good to miss. He had no wish to continue his unpleasant job digging anthracite. His body ached fearfully. Besides, if he could induce the gnomes to strike, he might be able to put the squeeze on Podrang II. Gru Magru had said the Emperor was a magician. Couldn't he, then, transform Crockett back into a man?</p>
   <p>"He's never done that," Brockle Buhn said, and Crockett realized he had spoken his thought aloud.</p>
   <p>"Couldn't he, though – if he wanted?"</p>
   <p>Brockle Buhn merely shuddered, but Crockett had a little gleam of hope. To be human again!</p>
   <p>Dig ... dig ... dig ... dig ... with monotonous, deadening regularity. Crockett sank into a stupor. Unless he got the gnomes to strike, he was faced with an eternity of arduous toil. He was scarcely conscious of knocking off, of feeling Brockle Buhn's gnarled hand under his arm, of being led through passages to a tiny cubicle, which was his new home. The gnome left him there, and he crawled into a stony bunk and went to sleep.</p>
   <p>Presently a casual kick aroused him. Blinking, Crockett sat up, instinctively dodging the blow Gru Magru was aiming at his head. He had four guests – Gru, Brockle Buhn, Drook and the red-haired Mugza.</p>
   <p>"Sorry I woke up too soon," Crockett said bitterly. "If I hadn't, you could have got in another kick."</p>
   <p>"There's lots of time," Gru said. "Now, what's this all about? I wanted to sleep, but Brockle Buhn here said there was going to be a fight. A <emphasis>big</emphasis> one, huh?"</p>
   <p>"Eat first," Brockle Buhn said firmly. "I'll fix mud soup for everybody." She bustled away, and presently was busy in a corner, preparing refreshments. The other gnomes squatted on their haunches, and Crockett sat on the edge of his bunk, still dazed with sleep.</p>
   <p>But he managed to explain his idea of the union. It was received with interest – chiefly, he felt, because it involved the possibility of a tremendous scrap.</p>
   <p>"You mean every Dornsef gnome jumps the Emperor?" Gru asked.</p>
   <p>"No, no! Peaceful arbitration. We just refuse to work. All of us."</p>
   <p>"<emphasis>I</emphasis> can't," Drook said. "Podrang's got to have his mud baths, the bloated old slug. He'd send me to the fumaroles till I was roasted."</p>
   <p>"Who'd take you there?" Crockett asked.</p>
   <p>"Oh – the guards, I suppose."</p>
   <p>"But they'd be on strike, too. <emphasis>Nobody will</emphasis> obey Podrang, till he gave in."</p>
   <p>"Then he'd enchant me," Drook said.</p>
   <p>"He can't enchant us all," Crockett countered.</p>
   <p>"But he could enchant <emphasis>me</emphasis>," Drook said with great firmness. "Besides, he <emphasis>could</emphasis> put a spell on every gnome in Dornsef. Turn us into stalactites or something."</p>
   <p>"Then what? He wouldn't have any gnomes at all. Half a loaf is better than none. We'll just use logic on him. Wouldn't he rather have a little less work done than none at all?"</p>
   <p>"Not him," Gru put in. "He'd rather enchant us. Oh, he's a bad one, he is," the gnome finished approvingly.</p>
   <p>But Crockett couldn't quite believe this. It was too alien to his understanding of psychology – human psychology, of course. He turned to Mugza, who was glowering furiously.</p>
   <p>"What do you think about it?"</p>
   <p>"I want to fight," the other said rancorously. "I want to kick somebody."</p>
   <p>"Wouldn't you rather have mud baths three times a day?"</p>
   <p>Mugza grunted. "Sure. But the Emperor won't let me."</p>
   <p>"Why not?"</p>
   <p>"Because I want 'em."</p>
   <p>"You can't be contented," Crockett said desperately. "There's more to life than – than digging."</p>
   <p>"Sure. There's fighting. Podrang lets us fight whenever we want."</p>
   <p>Crockett had a sudden inspiration. "But that's just it. He's going to stop all fighting! He's going to pass a new law forbidding fighting except to himself."</p>
   <p>It was an effective shot in the dark. Every gnome jumped. "<emphasis>Stop – fighting!</emphasis>" That was Gru, angry and disbelieving. "Why, we've always fought."</p>
   <p>"Well, you'll have to stop," Crockett insisted.</p>
   <p>"Won't!"</p>
   <p>"Exactly! Why should you? Every gnome's entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of – of pugilism."</p>
   <p>"Let's go and beat up Podrang," Mugza offered, accepting a steaming bowl of mud soup from Brockle Buhn.</p>
   <p>"No, that's not the way – no, thanks, Brockle Buhn – not the way at all. A strike's the thing. We'll peaceably force Podrang to give us what we want."</p>
   <p>He turned to Drook. "Just what can Podrang do about it if we all sit down and refuse to work?"</p>
   <p>The little gnome considered. "He'd swear. And kick me."</p>
   <p>"Yeah – and then what?"</p>
   <p>"Then he'd go off and enchant everybody, tunnel by tunnel."</p>
   <p>"Uh-huh." Crockett nodded. "A good point. Solidarity is what we need. If Podrang finds a few gnomes together, he can scare the hell out of them. But if we're all together – that's it! When the strike's called, we'll all meet in the biggest cave in the joint."</p>
   <p>"That's the Council Chamber," Gru said. "Next to Podrang's throne room."</p>
   <p>"O.K. We'll meet there. How many gnomes will join us?"</p>
   <p>"All of 'em," Mugza grunted, throwing his soup bowl at Drook's head. "The Emperor can't stop us fighting."</p>
   <p>"And what weapons can Podrang use, Drook?"</p>
   <p>"He might use the Cockatrice Eggs," the other said doubtfully.</p>
   <p>"What are those?"</p>
   <p>"They're not really eggs," Gru broke in. "They're magic jewels for wholesale enchantments. Different spells in each one. The green ones, I think, are for turning people into earthworms. Podrang just breaks one, and the spell spreads out for twenty feet or so. The red ones are – let's see. Transforming gnomes into human beings – though that's a bit <emphasis>too</emphasis> tough. No ... yes. The blue ones –"</p>
   <p>"Into <emphasis>human beings</emphasis>!" Crockett's eyes widened. "Where are the eggs kept?"</p>
   <p>"Let's fight," Mugza offered, and hurled himself bodily on Drook, who squeaked frantically and beat his attacker over the head with his soup bowl, which broke. Brockle Buhn added to the excitement by kicking both battlers impartially, till felled by Gru Magru. Within a few moments the room resounded with the excited screams of gnomic battle. Inevitably Crockett was sucked in.</p>
   <p>Of all the perverted, incredible forms of life that had ever existed, gnomes were about the oddest. It was impossible to understand their philosophy. Their minds worked along different paths from human intelligences. Self-preservation and survival of the race – these two vital human instincts were lacking in gnomes. They neither died nor propagated. They just worked and fought. Bad-tempered little monsters, Crockett thought irritably. Yet they had existed for – ages. Since the beginning, maybe. Their social organism was the result of evolution far older than man's. It might be well suited to gnomes. Crockett might be throwing the unnecessary monkey wrench in the machinery.</p>
   <p>So what? He wasn't going to spend eternity digging anthracite, even though, in retrospect, he remembered feeling a curious thrill of obscure pleasure as he worked. Digging might be fun for gnomes. Certainly it was their <emphasis>raison d'être</emphasis>. In time Crockett himself might lose his human affiliations, and be metamorphosed completely into a gnome. What bad happened to other humans who had undergone such an – alteration as he had done? All gnomes look alike. But maybe Gru Magru had once been human – or Drook – or Brockle Buhn.</p>
   <p>They were gnomes now, at any rate, thinking and existing completely as gnomes. And in time he himself would be exactly like them. Already he had acquired the strange tropism that attracted him to metals and repelled him from daylight. But he didn't <emphasis>like</emphasis> to dig!</p>
   <p>He tried to recall the little he knew about gnomes – miners, metal-smiths, living underground. There was something about the Picts – dwarfish men who hid underground when invaders came to England, centuries ago. That seemed to tie in vaguely with the gnomes' dread of human beings. But the gnomes themselves were certainly not descended from Picts. Very likely the two separate races and species had become identified through occupying the same habitat.</p>
   <p>Well, that was no help. What about the Emperor? He wasn't, apparently, a gnome with a high I.Q., but he <emphasis>was</emphasis> a magician. Those jewels – Cockatrice Eggs – were significant. If he could get hold of the ones that transformed gnomes into men .</p>
   <p>But obviously he couldn't, at present. Better wait. Till the strike had been called. The strike.</p>
   <p>Crockett went to sleep.</p>
   <p>He was roused, painfully, by Brockle Buhn, who seemed to have adopted him. Very likely it was her curiosity about the matter of a kiss. From time to time she offered to give Crockett one, but he steadfastly refused. In lieu of it, she supplied him with breakfast. At least, he thought grimly, he'd get plenty of iron in his system, even though the rusty chips rather resembled corn flakes. As a special inducement Brockle Buhn sprinkled coal dust over the mess.</p>
   <p>Well, no doubt his digestive system had also altered. Crockett wished he could get an X-ray picture of his insides. Then he decided it would be much too disturbing. Better not to know. But he could not help wondering. Gears in his stomach? Small millstones? What would happen if he inadvertently swallowed some emery dust? Maybe he could sabotage the Emperor that way.</p>
   <p>Perceiving that his thoughts were beginning to veer wildly, Crockett gulped the last of his meal and followed Brockle Buhn to the anthracite tunnel.</p>
   <p>"How about the strike? How's it coming?"</p>
   <p>"Fine, Crockett." She smiled, and Crockett winced at the sight. "Tonight all the gnomes will meet in the Roaring Cave. Just after work."</p>
   <p>There was no time for more conversation. The overseer appeared, and the gnomes snatched up their picks. Dig ... dig ... dig ...</p>
   <p>It kept up at the same pace. Crockett sweated and toiled. It wouldn't be for long. His mind slipped a cog, so that he relapsed into a waking slumber, his muscles responding automatically to the need. Dig, dig, dig. Sometimes a fight. Once a rest period. Then dig again.</p>
   <p>Five centuries later the day ended. It was time to sleep.</p>
   <p>But there was something much more important. The union meeting in the Roaring Cave. Brockle Buhn conducted Crockett there, a huge cavern hung with glittering green stalactites. Gnomes came pouring into it. Gnomes and more gnomes. The turnip heads were everywhere. A dozen fights started. Gru Magru, Mugza and Drook found places near Crockett. During a lull Brockle Buhn urged him to a platform of rock jutting from the floor.</p>
   <p>"Now," she whispered. "They all know about it. Tell them what you want."</p>
   <p>Crockett was looking out over the bobbing heads, the red and blue garments, all lit by that eerie silver glow. "Fellow gnomes," he began weakly.</p>
   <p>"<emphasis>Fellow gnomes!</emphasis>" The words roared out, magnified by the acoustics of the cavern. That bull bellow gave Crockett courage. He plunged on.</p>
   <p>"Why should you work twenty hours a day? Why should you be forbidden to eat the anthracite you dig, while Podrang squats in his bath and laughs at you? Fellow gnomes, the Emperor is only one; you are many! He can't make you work. How would you like mud soup three times a day? The Emperor can't fight you all. If you refuse to work – all of you – he'll have to give in! He'll have to!"</p>
   <p>"Tell 'em about the non-fighting edict," Gru Magru called.</p>
   <p>Crockett obeyed. That got 'em. Fighting was dear to every gnomic heart. And Crockett kept on talking.</p>
   <p>"Podrang will try to back down, you know. He'll pretend he never intended to forbid fighting. That'll show he's afraid of you! We hold the whip hand! We'll strike – and the Emperor can't do a damn thing about it. When he runs out of mud for his baths, he'll capitulate soon enough."</p>
   <p>"He'll enchant us all," Drook muttered sadly.</p>
   <p>"He won't dare! What good would that do? He knows which side his – ugh – which side his mud is buttered on. Podrang is unfair to gnomes! That's our watchword!"</p>
   <p>It ended, of course, in a brawl. But Crockett was satisfied. The gnomes would not go to work tomorrow. They would, instead, meet in the Council Chamber, adjoining Podrang's throne room – and sit down.</p>
   <p>That night he slept well.</p>
   <p>In the morning Crockett went, with Brockle Buhn, to the Council Chamber, a cavern gigantic enough to hold the thousands of gnomes who thronged it. In the silver light their red and blue garments had a curiously elfin quality. Or, perhaps, naturally enough, Crockett thought. Were gnomes, strictly speaking, elves?</p>
   <p>Drook came up. "I didn't draw Podrang's mud bath," he confided hoarsely. "Oh, but he'll be furious. Listen to him."</p>
   <p>And, indeed, a distant crackling of profanity was coming through an archway in one wall of the cavern.</p>
   <p>Mugza and Gru Magru joined them. "He'll be along directly," the latter said. "What a fight there'll be!"</p>
   <p>"Let's fight now," Mugza suggested. "I want to kick somebody. Hard."</p>
   <p>"There's a gnome who's asleep," Crockett said. "If you sneak up on him, you can land a good one right in his face."</p>
   <p>Mugza, drooling slightly, departed on his errand, and simultaneously Podrang II, Emperor of the Dornsef Gnomes, stumped into the cavern. It was the first time Crockett had seen the ruler without a coating of mud, and he could not help gulping at the sight. Podrang was very ugly. He combined in himself the most repulsive qualities of every gnome Crockett had previously seen. The result was perfectly indescribable.</p>
   <p>"Ah," said Podrang, halting and swaying on his short bow legs. "I have guests. Drook! Where in the name of the nine steaming hells is my bath?" But Drook had ducked from sight.</p>
   <p>The Emperor nodded. "I see. Well, I won't lose my temper, <emphasis>I won't lose my temper</emphasis>! I WON'T –"</p>
   <p>He paused as a stalactite was dislodged from the roof and crashed down. In the momentary silence, Crockett stepped forward, cringing slightly.</p>
   <p>"W-we're on strike," he announced. "It's a sit-down strike. We won't work till –"</p>
   <p>"<emphasis>Yaah!</emphasis>" screamed the infuriated Emperor. "You won't work, eh? Why, you boggle-eyed, flap-tongued, drag-bellied offspring of unmentionable algae! You seething little leprous blotch of bat-nibbled fungus! You cringing parasite on the underside of a dwarfish and ignoble worm! <emphasis>Yaaah!</emphasis>"</p>
   <p>"Fight!" the irrepressible Mugza yelled, and flung himself on Podrang, only to be felled by a well-placed foul blow.</p>
   <p>Crockett's throat felt dry. He raised his voice, trying to keep it steady.</p>
   <p>"Your Majesty! If you'll just wait a minute –"</p>
   <p>"You mushroom-nosed spawn of degenerate black bats," the enraged Emperor shrieked at the top of his voice. "I'll enchant you all! I'll turn you into naiads! Strike, will you! Stop me from having my mud bath, will you? By Kronos, Nid, Ymir and Loki, you'll have cause to regret this! <emphasis>Yah!</emphasis>" he finished, inarticulate with fury.</p>
   <p>"Quick!" Crockett whispered to Gru and Brockle Buhn. "Get between him and the door, so he can't get hold of the Cockatrice Eggs."</p>
   <p>"They're not in the throne room," Gru Magru explained unhelpfully. "Podrang just grabs them out of the air."</p>
   <p>"Oh!" the harassed Crockett groaned. At that strategic moment Brockle Buhn's worst instincts overcame her. With a loud shriek of delight she knocked Crockett down, kicked him twice and sprang for the Emperor.</p>
   <p>She got in one good blow before Podrang hammered her atop the head with one gnarled fist, and instantly her turnip-shaped skull seemed to prolapse into her torso. The Emperor, bright purple with fury, reached out – and a yellow crystal appeared in his hand.</p>
   <p>It was one of the Cockatrice Eggs.</p>
   <p>Bellowing like a <emphasis>musth</emphasis> elephant, Podrang hurled it. A circle of twenty feet was instantly cleared among the massed gnomes. But it wasn't vacant. Dozens of bats rose and fluttered about, adding to the confusion.</p>
   <p>Confusion became chaos. With yells of delighted fury, the gnomes rolled forward toward their ruler. "Fight!" the cry thundered out, reverberating from the roof. "<emphasis>Fight!</emphasis>"</p>
   <p>Podrang snatched another crystal from nothingness – a green one, this time. Thirty-seven gnomes were instantly transformed into earthworms, and were trampled. The Emperor went down under an avalanche of attackers, who abruptly disappeared, turned into mice by another of the Cockatrice Eggs.</p>
   <p>Crockett saw one of the crystals sailing toward him, and ran like hell. He found a hiding place behind a stalagmite, and from there watched the carnage. It was definitely a sight worth seeing, though it could not be recommended to a nervous man.</p>
   <p>The Cockatrice Eggs exploded in an incessant stream. Whenever that happened, the spell spread out for twenty feet or more before losing its efficacy. Those caught on the fringes of the circle were only partially transformed. Crockett saw one gnome with a mole's head. Another was a worm from the waist down. Another was – <emphasis>kelp!</emphasis> Some of the spell patterns were not, apparently, drawn even from known mythology.</p>
   <p>The fury of noise that filled the cavern brought stalactites crashing down incessantly from the roof. Every so often Podrang's battered head would reappear, only to go down again as more gnomes sprang to the attack – to be enchanted. Mice, moles, bats and other things filled the Council Chamber. Crockett shut his eyes and prayed.</p>
   <p>He opened them in time to see Podrang snatch a red crystal out of the air, pause and then deposit it gently behind him. A purple Cockatrice Egg came next. This crashed against the floor, and thirty gnomes turned into tree toads.</p>
   <p>Apparently only Podrang was immune to his own magic. The thousands who had filled the cavern were rapidly thinning, for the Cockatrice Eggs seemed to come from an inexhaustible source of supply. How long would it be before Crockett's own turn came? He couldn't hide here forever.</p>
   <p>His gaze riveted to the red crystal Podrang had so carefully put down. He was remembering something – the Cockatrice Egg that would transform gnomes into human beings. Of course! Podrang wouldn't use <emphasis>that</emphasis>, since the very sight of men was so distressing to gnomes. If Crockett could get his hands on that red crystal.</p>
   <p>He tried it, sneaking through the confusion, sticking close to the wall of the cavern, till he neared Podrang. The Emperor was swept away by another onrush of gnomes, who abruptly changed into dormice, and Crockett got the red jewel. It felt abnormally cold.</p>
   <p>He almost broke it at his feet before a thought stopped and chilled him. He was far under Dornsef Mountain, in a labyrinth of caverns. No human being could find his way out. But a gnome could, with the aid of his strange tropism to daylight.</p>
   <p>A bat flew against Crockett's face. He was almost certain it squeaked, "What a fight!" in a parody of Brockle Buhn's voice, but he couldn't be sure. He cast one glance over the cavern before turning to flee.</p>
   <p>It was a complete and utter chaos. Bats, moles, worms, ducks, eels and a dozen other species crawled, flew, ran, bit, shrieked, snarled, grunted, whooped and croaked all over the place. From all directions the remaining gnomes – only about a thousand now – were converging on a surging mound of gnomes that marked where the Emperor was. As Crockett stared the mound dissolved, and a number of gecko lizards ran to safety.</p>
   <p>"<emphasis>Strike, will you!</emphasis>" Podrang bellowed. "<emphasis>I'll show you!</emphasis>"</p>
   <p>Crockett turned and fled. The throne room was deserted, and he ducked into the first tunnel. There, he concentrated on thinking of daylight. His left ear felt compressed. He sped on till he saw a side passage on the left, slanting up, and turned into it at top speed. The muffled noise of combat died behind him.</p>
   <p>He clutched the red Cockatrice Egg tightly. What had gone wrong? Podrang should have stopped to parley. Only – only he hadn't. A singularly bad-tempered and short-sighted gnome. He probably wouldn't stop till he'd depopulated his entire kingdom. At the thought Crockett hurried along faster.</p>
   <p>The tropism guided him. Sometimes he took the wrong tunnel, but always, whenever he thought of daylight, he would <emphasis>feel</emphasis> the nearest daylight pressing against him. His short, bowed legs were surprisingly hardy.</p>
   <p>Then he heard someone running after him.</p>
   <p>He didn't turn. The sizzling blast of profanity that curled his ears told him the identity of the pursuer. Podrang had no doubt cleared the Council Chamber, to the last gnome, and was now intending to tear Crockett apart pinch by pinch. That was only one of the things he promised.</p>
   <p>Crockett ran. He shot along the tunnel like a bullet. The tropism guided him, but he was terrified lest he reach a dead end. The clamor from behind grew louder. If Crockett hadn't known better, he would have imagined that an army of gnomes pursued him.</p>
   <p>Faster! Faster! But now Podrang was in sight. His roars shook the very walls. Crockett sprinted, rounded a corner, and saw a wall of flaming light – a circle of it, in the distance. It was daylight, as it appeared to gnomic eyes.</p>
   <p>He could not reach it in time. Podrang was too close. A few more seconds, and those gnarled, terrible hands would close on Crockett's throat.</p>
   <p>Then Crockett remembered the Cockatrice Egg. If he transformed himself into a man now, Podrang would not dare touch him. And he was almost at the tunnel's mouth.</p>
   <p>He stopped, whirling and lifted the jewel. Simultaneously the Emperor, seeing his intention, reached out with both hands, and snatched six or seven of the crystals out of the air. He threw them directly at Crockett, a fusillade of rainbow colors.</p>
   <p>But Crockett had already slammed the red gem down on the rock at his feet. There was an ear-splitting crash. Jewels seemed to burst all around Crockett – but the red one had been broken first.</p>
   <p>The roof fell in.</p>
   <p>A short while later, Crockett dragged himself painfully from the debris. A glance showed him that the way to the outer world was still open. And – thank heaven! – daylight looked normal again, not that flaming blaze of eye-searing white.</p>
   <p>He looked toward the depths of the tunnel, and froze. Podrang was emerging, with some difficulty, from a mound of rubble. His low curses had lost none of their fire.</p>
   <p>Crockett turned to run, stumbled over a rock, and fell flat. As he sprang up, he saw that Podrang had seen him.</p>
   <p>The gnome stood transfixed for a moment. Then he yelled, spun on his heel, and fled into the darkness. He was gone. The sound of his rapid footfalls died.</p>
   <p>Crockett swallowed with difficulty. <emphasis>Gnomes are afraid of men </emphasis>– <emphasis>whew!</emphasis> That had been a close squeak. But now.</p>
   <p>He was more relieved than he had thought. Subconsciously he must have been wondering whether the spell would work, since Podrang had flung six or seven Cockatrice Eggs at him. But he had smashed the red one first. Even the strange, silvery gnome-light was gone. The depths of the cave were utterly black – and silent.</p>
   <p>Crockett headed for the entrance. He pulled himself out, luxuriating in the warmth of the afternoon sun. He was near the foot of Dornsef Mountain, in a patch of brambles. A hundred feet away a farmer was plowing one terrace of a field.</p>
   <p>Crockett stumbled toward him. As he approached, the man turned. He stood transfixed for a moment. Then he yelled, spun on his heel, and fled.</p>
   <p>His shrieks drifted back up the mountain as Crockett, remembering the Cockatrice Eggs, forced himself to look down at his own body.</p>
   <p>Then he screamed too. But the sound was not one that could ever have emerged from a human throat.</p>
   <p>Still, that was natural enough – under the circumstances.</p>

    <p>WHAT YOU NEED</p>

   <p>That's what the sign said. Tim Carmichael, who worked for a trade paper that specialized in economics, and eked out a meager salary by selling sensational and untrue articles to the tabloids, failed to sense a story in the reversed sign. He thought it was a cheap publicity gag, something one seldom encounters on Park Avenue, where the shop fronts are noted for their classic dignity. And he was irritated.</p>
   <p>He growled silently, walked on, then suddenly turned and came back. He wasn't quite strong enough to resist the temptation to unscramble the sentence, though his annoyance grew. He stood before the window, staring up, and said to himself, "We have what you need. Yeah?"</p>
   <p>The sign was in prim, small letters on a black painted ribbon that stretched across a narrow glass pane. Below it was one of those curved, invisible-glass windows. Through the window Carmichael could see an expanse of white velvet, with a few objects carefully arranged there. A rusty nail, a snowshoe and a diamond tiara. It looked like a Dali decor for Carrier or Tiffany.</p>
   <p>"Jewelers?" Carmichael asked silently. "But why <emphasis>what you need</emphasis>?" He pictured millionaires miserably despondent for lack of a matched pearl necklace, heiresses weeping inconsolably because they needed a few star sapphires. The principle of luxury merchandising was to deal with the whipped cream of supply and demand; few people needed diamonds. They merely wanted them and could afford them.</p>
   <p>"Or the place might sell jinni flasks," Carmichael decided. "Or magic wands. Same principle as a Coney carny, though. A sucker trap. Bill the Whatzit outside and people will pay their dimes and flock in. For two cents –"</p>
   <p>He was dyspeptic this morning, and generally disliked the world. Prospect of a scapegoat was attractive, and his press card gave him a certain advantage. He opened the door and walked into the shop.</p>
   <p>It was Park Avenue, all right. There were no showcases or counters. It might be an art gallery, for a few good oils were displayed on the walls. An air of overpowering luxury, with the bleakness of an unlived-in place, struck Carmichael.</p>
   <p>Through a curtain at the back came a very tall man with carefully combed white hair, a ruddy, healthy face and sharp blue eyes. He might have been sixty. He wore expensive but careless tweeds, which somehow jarred with the decor.</p>
   <p>"Good morning," the man said, with a quick glance at Carmichael's clothes. He seemed slightly surprised. "May I help you?"</p>
   <p>"Maybe." Carmichael introduced himself and showed his press card.</p>
   <p>"Oh? My name is Talley. Peter Talley."</p>
   <p>"I saw your sign."</p>
   <p>"Oh?"</p>
   <p>"Our paper is always on the lookout for possible writeups. I've never noticed your shop before –"</p>
   <p>"I've been here for years," Talley said.</p>
   <p>"This is an art gallery?"</p>
   <p>"Well – no."</p>
   <p>The door opened. A florid man came in and greeted Talley cordially. Carmichael, recognizing the client, felt his opinion of the shop swing rapidly upward. The florid man was a Name – a big one.</p>
   <p>"It's a bit early, Mr. Talley," he said, "but I didn't want to delay. Have you had time to get – what I needed?"</p>
   <p>"Oh, yes. I have it. One moment." Talley hurried through the draperies and returned with a small, neatly wrapped parcel, which he gave to the florid man. The latter forked over a check – Carmichael caught a glimpse of the amount and gulped – and departed. His town car was at the curb outside.</p>
   <p>Carmichael moved toward the door, where he could watch. The florid man seemed anxious. His chauffeur waited stolidly as the parcel was unwrapped with hurried fingers.</p>
   <p>"I'm not sure I'd want publicity, Mr. Carmichael," Talley said. "I've a select clientele – carefully chosen."</p>
   <p>"Perhaps our weekly economic bulletins might interest you."</p>
   <p>Talley tried not to laugh. "Oh, I don't think so. It really isn't in my line."</p>
   <p>The florid man had finally unwrapped the parcel and taken out an egg. As far as Carmichael could see from his post near the door, it was merely an ordinary egg. But its possessor regarded it almost with awe. Had Earth's last hen died ten years before, the man could have been no more pleased. Something like deep relief showed on the Florida-tanned face.</p>
   <p>He said something to the chauffeur, and the car rolled smoothly forward and was gone.</p>
   <p>"Are you in the dairy business?" Carmichael asked abruptly.</p>
   <p>"Do you mind telling me what your business is?"</p>
   <p>"I'm afraid I do, rather," Talley said.</p>
   <p>Carmichael was beginning to scent a story. "Of course, I could find out through the Better Business Bureau –"</p>
   <p>"You couldn't."</p>
   <p>"No? They might be interested in knowing why an egg is worth five thousand dollars to one of your customers."</p>
   <p>Talley said, "My clientele is so small I must charge high fees. You – ah – know that a Chinese mandarin has been known to pay thousands of <emphasis>taels</emphasis> for eggs of proved antiquity."</p>
   <p>"That guy wasn't a Chinese mandarin," Carmichael said.</p>
   <p>"Oh, well. As I say, I don't welcome publicity –"</p>
   <p>"I think you do. I was in the advertising game for a while. Spelling your sign backwards is an obvious baited hook."</p>
   <p>"Then you're no psychologist," Talley said. "It's just that I can afford to indulge my whims. For five years I looked at that window every day and read the sign backwards – from inside my shop. It annoyed me. You know how a word will begin to look funny if you keep staring at it? Any word. It turns into something in no human tongue. Well, I discovered I was getting a neurosis about that sign. It makes no sense backwards, but I kept finding myself trying to read sense into it. When I started to say 'Deen uoy tahw evah ew' to myself and looking for philological derivations, I called in a sign painter. People who are interested enough still drop in."</p>
   <p>"Not many," Carmichael said shrewdly. "This is Park Avenue. And you've got the place fixed up too expensively. Nobody in the low-income brackets – or the middle brackets – would come in here. So you run an upper-bracket business."</p>
   <p>"Well," Talley said, "yes, I do."</p>
   <p>"And you won't tell me what it is?"</p>
   <p>"I'd rather not."</p>
   <p>"I can find out, you know. It might be dope, pornography, high-class fencing –"</p>
   <p>"Very likely," Mr. Talley said smoothly. "I buy stolen jewels, conceal them in eggs and sell them to my customers. Or perhaps that egg was loaded with microscopic French postcards. Good morning, Mr. Carmichael."</p>
   <p>"Good morning," Carmichael said, and went out. He was overdue at the office, but annoyance was the stronger motivation. He played sleuth for a while, keeping an eye on Talley's shop, and the results were thoroughly satisfactory – to a certain extent. He learned everything but why. Late in the afternoon, he sought out Mr. Talley again.</p>
   <p>"Wait a minute," he said, at sight of the proprietor's discouraging face. "For all you know, I may be a customer."</p>
   <p>Talley laughed.</p>
   <p>"Well, why not?" Carmichael compressed his lips. "How do you know the size of my bank account? Or maybe you've got a restricted clientele?"</p>
   <p>"No. But –"</p>
   <p>Carmichael said quickly, "I've been doing some investigating. I've been noticing your customers. In fact, following them. And finding out what they buy from you."</p>
   <p>Talley's face changed. "Indeed?"</p>
   <p>"In-<emphasis>deed</emphasis>. They're all in a hurry to unwrap their little bundles. So that gave me my chance to find out. I missed a few, but – I saw enough to apply a couple of rules of logic, Mr. Talley. <emphasis>Item</emphasis>: your customers don't know what they're buying from you. It's a sort of grab bag. A couple of times they were plenty surprised. The man who opened his parcel and found an old newspaper clipping. What about the sunglasses? And the revolver? Probably illegal, by the way – no license. And the diamond – it must have been paste, it was so big."</p>
   <p>"M-mmm," Mr. Talley said.</p>
   <p>"I'm no smart apple, but I can smell a screwy setup. Most of your clients are big shots, in one way or another. And why didn't any of 'em pay you, like the first man – the guy who came in when I was here this morning?"</p>
   <p>"It's chiefly a credit business," Talley said. "I've my ethics. I have to, for my own conscience. It's responsibility. You see, I sell – my goods – with a guarantee. Payment is made only if the product proves satisfactory."</p>
   <p>"So. An egg. Sunglasses. A pair of asbestos gloves – I think they were. A newspaper clipping. A gun. And a diamond. How do you take inventory?"</p>
   <p>Talley said nothing.</p>
   <p>Carmichael grinned. "You've an errand boy. You send him out and he comes back with bundles. Maybe he goes to a grocery on Madison and buys an egg. Or a pawnshop on Sixth for a revolver. Or – well, anyhow, I told you I'd find out what your business is."</p>
   <p>"And have you?" Talley asked.</p>
   <p>"We have what you need," Carmichael said. "But how do you <emphasis>know</emphasis>?"</p>
   <p>"You're jumping to conclusions."</p>
   <p>"I've got a headache – I didn't have sunglasses! – and I don't believe in magic. Listen, Mr. Talley, I'm fed up to the eyebrows and way beyond on queer little shops that sell peculiar things. I know too much about 'em – I've written about 'em. A guy walks along the street and sees a funny sort of store and the proprietor won't serve him – he sells only to pixies – or else he <emphasis>does</emphasis> sell him a magic charm with a double edge. Well – <emphasis>pfui!</emphasis>"</p>
   <p>"Mph," Talley said.</p>
   <p>"'Mph' as much as you like. But you can't get away from logic. Either you've got a sound, sensible racket here, or else it's one of those funny, magic-shop setups – and I don't believe that. For it isn't logical."</p>
   <p>"Why not?"</p>
   <p>"Because of economics," Carmichael said flatly. "Grant the idea that you've got certain mysterious powers – let's say you can make telepathic gadgets. All right. Why the devil would you start a business so you could sell the gadgets so you could make money so you could live? You'd simply put on one of your gadgets, read a stockbroker's mind and buy the right stocks. That's the intrinsic fallacy in these crazy-shop things – if you've got enough stuff on the ball to be able to stock and run such a shop, you wouldn't need a business in the first place. Why go round Robin Hood's barn?"</p>
   <p>Talley said nothing.</p>
   <p>Carmichael smiled crookedly. "'I often wonder what the vintners buy one half so precious as the stuff they sell," he quoted. "Well – what do <emphasis>you</emphasis> buy? I know what you sell – eggs and sunglasses."</p>
   <p>"You're an inquisitive man, Mr. Carmichael," Talley murmured. "Has it ever occurred to you that this is none of your business?"</p>
   <p>"I may be a customer," Carmichael repeated. "How about that?"</p>
   <p>Talley's cool blue eyes were intent. A new light dawned in them; Talley pursed his lips and scowled. "I hadn't thought of that," he admitted. "You might be. Under the circumstances. Will you excuse me for a moment?"</p>
   <p>"Sure," Carmichael said. Talley went through the curtains.</p>
   <p>Outside, traffic drifted idly along Park. As the sun slid down beyond the Hudson, the street lay in a blue shadow that crept imperceptibly up the barricades of the buildings. Carmichael stared at the sign – WE HAVE WHAT YOU NEED – and smiled.</p>
   <p>In a back room, Talley put his eye to a binocular plate and moved a calibrated dial. He did this several times. Then, biting his lip – for he was a gentle man – he called his errand boy and gave him directions. After that he returned to Carmichael.</p>
   <p>"You're a customer," he said. "Under certain conditions."</p>
   <p>"The condition of my bank account, you mean?"</p>
   <p>"No," Talley said. "I'll give you reduced rates. Understand one thing. I really do have what you need. You don't know what you need, but I know. And as it happens – well, I'll sell you what you need for, let's say, five dollars."</p>
   <p>Carmichael reached for his wallet. Talley held up a hand.</p>
   <p>"Pay me after you're satisfied. And the money's the nominal part of the fee. There's another part. If you're satisfied, I want you to promise that you'll never come near this shop again and never mention it to anyone."</p>
   <p>"I see," Carmichael said slowly. His theories had changed slightly. "It won't be long before – ah, here he is now." A buzzing from the back indicated the return of the errand boy. Talley said, "Excuse me," and vanished. Soon he returned with a neatly wrapped parcel, which he thrust into Carmichael's hands.</p>
   <p>"Keep this on your person," Talley said. "Good afternoon."</p>
   <p>Carmichael nodded, pocketed the parcel and went out. Feeling affluent, he hailed a taxi and went to a cocktail bar he knew. There, in the dim light of a booth, he unwrapped the bundle.</p>
   <p>Protection money, he decided. Talley was paying him off to keep his mouth shut about the racket, whatever it was. O.K., live and let live. How much would be –</p>
   <p>Ten thousand? Fifty thousand? How big was the racket?</p>
   <p>He opened an oblong cardboard box. Within, nestling upon tissue paper, was a pair of shears, the blades protected by a sheath of folded, glued cardboard.</p>
   <p>Carmichael said something softly. He drank his highball and ordered another, but left it untasted. Glancing at his wrist watch, he decided that the Park Avenue shop would be closed by now and Mr. Peter Talley gone.</p>
   <p>"... one half so precious as the stuff they sell." Carmichael said. "Maybe it's the scissors of Atropos. Blah." He unsheathed the blades and snipped experimentally at the air. Nothing happened. Slightly crimson around the cheekbones, Carmichael reholstered the shears and dropped them into the side pocket of his topcoat. Quite a gag!</p>
   <p>He decided to call on Peter Talley tomorrow.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, what? He remembered he had a dinner date with one of the girls at the office, and hastily paid his bill and left. The streets were darkening, and a cold wind blew southward from the Park. Carmichael wound his scarf tighter around his throat and made gestures toward passing taxis.</p>
   <p>He was considerably annoyed.</p>
   <p>Half an hour later a thin man with sad eyes – Jerry Worth, one of the copy writers from his office – greeted him at the bar where Carmichael was killing time. "Waiting for Betsy?" Worth said, nodding toward the restaurant annex. "She sent me to tell you she couldn't make it. A rush deadline. Apologies and stuff. Where were you today? Things got gummed up a bit. Have a drink with me."</p>
   <p>They worked on a rye. Carmichael was already slightly stiff. The dull crimson around his cheekbones had deepened, and his frown had become set. "What you need," he remarked. "Double crossing little –"</p>
   <p>"Huh?" Worth said.</p>
   <p>"Nothing. Drink up. I've just decided to get a guy in trouble. If I can."</p>
   <p>"You almost got in trouble yourself today. That trend analysis of ores –"</p>
   <p>"Eggs. Sunglasses!"</p>
   <p>"I got you out of a jam –"</p>
   <p>"Shut up," Carmichael said, and ordered another round. Every time he felt the weight of the shears in his pocket he found his lips moving.</p>
   <p>Five shots later Worth said plaintively, "I don't mind doing good deeds, but I do like to mention them. And you won't let me. All I want is a little gratitude."</p>
   <p>"All right, mention them," Carmichael said. "Brag your head off. Who cares?"</p>
   <p>Worth showed satisfaction. "That ore analysis – it was that. You weren't at the office today, but I caught it. I checked with our records and you had Trans-Steel all wrong. If I hadn't altered the figures, it would have gone down to the printer –"</p>
   <p>"What?"</p>
   <p>"The Trans-Steel. They –"</p>
   <p>"Oh, you fool," Carmichael groaned. "I know it didn't check with the office figures. I meant to put in a notice to have them changed. I got my dope from the source. Why don't you mind your own business?"</p>
   <p>Worth blinked. "I was trying to help."</p>
   <p>"It would have been good for a five-buck raise," Carmichael said. "After all the research I did to uncover the real dope – listen, has the stuff gone to bed yet?"</p>
   <p>"I dunno. Maybe not. Croft was still checking the copy –"</p>
   <p>"O.K.!" Carmichael said. "Next time –" He jerked at his scarf, jumped off the stool and headed for the door, trailed by the protesting Worth. Ten minutes later he was at the office, listening to Croft's bland explanation that the copy had already been dispatched to the printer.</p>
   <p>"Does it matter? Was there – incidentally, where were you today?"</p>
   <p>"Dancing on the rainbow," Carmichael snapped, and departed. He had switched over from rye to whisky sours, and the cold night air naturally did not sober him. Swaying slightly, watching the sidewalk move a little as he blinked at it, he stood on the curb and pondered.</p>
   <p>"I'm sorry, Tim," Worth said. "It's too late now, though. There won't be any trouble. You've got a right to go by our office records."</p>
   <p>"Stop me now," Carmichael said. "Lousy little –" He was angry and drunk. On impulse he got another taxi and sped to the printer's, still trailing a somewhat confused Jerry Worth.</p>
   <p>There was rhythmic thunder in the building. The swift movement of the taxi had given Carmichael a slight nausea; his head ached, and alcohol was in solution in his blood. The hot, inky air was unpleasant. The great Linotypes thumped and growled. Men were moving about. It was all slightly nightmarish, and Carmichael doggedly hunched his shoulders and lurched on until something jerked him back and began to strangle him.</p>
   <p>Worth started yelling. His face showed drunken terror. He made ineffectual gestures.</p>
   <p>But this was all part of the nightmare. Carmichael saw what had happened. The ends of his scarf had caught in the moving gears somewhere and he was being drawn inexorably into meshing metal cogs. Men were running. The clanking, thumping, rolling sounds were deafening. He pulled at the scarf.</p>
   <p>Worth screamed, "... knife! Cut it!"</p>
   <p>The warping of relative values that intoxication gives saved Carmichael. Sober, he would have been helpless with panic. As it was, each thought was hard to capture, but clear and lucid when he finally got it. He remembered the shears, and he put his hand in his pocket. The blades slipped out of their cardboard sheath, and he snipped through the scarf with fumbling, hasty movements.</p>
   <p>The white silk disappeared. Carmichael fingered the ragged edge at his throat and smiled stiffly.</p>
   <p>Mr. Peter Talley had been hoping that Carmichael would not come back. The probability lines had shown two possible variants; in one, all was well; in the other …</p>
   <p>Carmichael walked into the shop the next morning and held out a five-dollar bill. Talley took it.</p>
   <p>"Thank you. But you could have mailed me a check"</p>
   <p>"I could have. Only that wouldn't have told me what I wanted to know."</p>
   <p>"No," Talley said, and sighed. "You've decided, haven't you?"</p>
   <p>"Do you blame me?" Carmichael asked. "Last night – do you know what happened?"</p>
   <p>"Yes."</p>
   <p>"How?"</p>
   <p>"I might as well tell you," Talley said. "You'd find out anyway. That's certain, anyhow."</p>
   <p>Carmichael sat down, lit a cigarette and nodded. "Logic. You couldn't have arranged that little accident, by any manner of means. Betsy Hoag decided to break our date early yesterday morning. Before I saw you. That was the beginning of the chain of incidents that led up to the accident. Ergo, you must have known what was going to happen."</p>
   <p>"I did know."</p>
   <p>"Prescience?"</p>
   <p>"Mechanical. I saw that you would be crushed in the machine –"</p>
   <p>"Which implies an alterable future."</p>
   <p>"Certainly," Talley said, his shoulders slumping. "There are innumerable possible variants to the future. Different lines of probability. All depending on the outcome of various crises as they arise. I happen to be skilled in certain branches of electronics. Some years ago, almost by accident, I stumbled on the principle of seeing the future."</p>
   <p>"How?"</p>
   <p>"Chiefly it involves a personal focus on the individual. The moment you enter this place" – he gestured – "you're in the beam of my scanner. In my back room I have the machine itself. By turning a calibrated dial, I check the possible futures. Sometimes there are many. Sometimes only a few. As though at times certain stations weren't broadcasting. I look into my scanner and see what you need – and supply it."</p>
   <p>Carmichael let smoke drift from his nostrils. He watched the blue coils through narrowed eyes.</p>
   <p>"You follow a man's whole life – in triplicate or quadruplicate or whatever?"</p>
   <p>"No," Talley said. "I've got my device focused so it's sensitive to crisis curves. When those occur, I follow them farther and see what probability paths involve the man's safe and happy survival."</p>
   <p>"The sunglasses, the egg and the gloves –"</p>
   <p>Talley said, "Mr. – uh – Smith is one of my regular clients. Whenever he passes a crisis successfully, with my aid, he comes back for another checkup. I locate his next crisis and supply him with what he needs to meet it. I gave him the asbestos gloves. In about a month, a situation will arise where he must – under the circumstances – move a red-hot bar of metal. He's an artist. His hands –"</p>
   <p>"I see. So it isn't always saving a man's life."</p>
   <p>"Of course not," Talley said. "Life isn't the only vital factor. An apparently minor crisis may lead to – well, a divorce, a neurosis, a wrong decision and the loss of hundreds of lives indirectly. I insure life, health and happiness."</p>
   <p>"You're an altruist. Only why doesn't the world storm your doors? Why limit your trade to a few?"</p>
   <p>"I haven't got the time or the equipment."</p>
   <p>"More machines could be built."</p>
   <p>"Well," Talley said, "most of my customers are wealthy. I must live."</p>
   <p>"You could read tomorrow's stock-market reports if you wanted dough," Carmichael said. "We get back to that old question. If a guy has miraculous powers, why is he satisfied to run a hole-in-the-wall store?"</p>
   <p>"Economic reasons. I – ah – I'm averse to gambling."</p>
   <p>"It wouldn't be gambling," Carmichael pointed out. "'I often wonder what the vintners buy ...' Just what <emphasis>do</emphasis> you get out of this?"</p>
   <p>"Satisfaction," Talley said. "Call it that."</p>
   <p>But Carmichael wasn't satisfied. His mind veered from the question and turned to the possibilities. Insurance, eh? Life, health and happiness.</p>
   <p>"What about me? Won't there be another crisis in my life sometime?"</p>
   <p>"Probably. Not necessarily one involving personal danger."</p>
   <p>"Then I'm a permanent customer."</p>
   <p>"I – don't –"</p>
   <p>"Listen," Carmichael said, "I'm not trying to shake you down. I'll pay. I'll pay plenty. I'm not rich, but I know exactly what a service like this would be worth to me. No worries –"</p>
   <p>"It couldn't be –"</p>
   <p>"Oh, come off it. I'm not a blackmailer or anything. I'm not threatening you with publicity, if that's what you're afraid of. I'm an ordinary guy, not a melodramatic villain. Do I look dangerous? What are you afraid of?"</p>
   <p>"You're an ordinary guy, yes," Talley admitted. "Only –"</p>
   <p>"Why not?" Carmichael argued. "I won't bother you. I passed one crisis successfully, with your help. There'll be another one due sometime. Give me what I need for that. Charge me anything you like. I'll get the dough somehow. Borrow it, if necessary. I won't disturb you at all. All I ask is that you let me come in whenever I've passed a crisis, and get ammunition for the next one. What's wrong with that?"</p>
   <p>"Nothing," Talley said soberly.</p>
   <p>"Well, then. I'm an ordinary guy. There's a girl – it's Betsy Hoag. I want to marry her. Settle down somewhere in the country, raise kids and have security. There's nothing wrong with that either, is there?"</p>
   <p>Talley said, "It was too late the moment you entered this shop today."</p>
   <p>Carmichael looked up. "Why?" he asked sharply.</p>
   <p>A buzzer rang in the back. Talley went through the curtains and came back almost immediately with a wrapped parcel. He gave it to Carmichael.</p>
   <p>Carmichael smiled. "Thanks," he said. "Thanks a lot. Do you have any idea when my next crisis will come?"</p>
   <p>"In a week."</p>
   <p>"Mind if I –" Carmichael was unwrapping the package. He took out a pair of plastic-soled shoes and looked at Talley, bewildered.</p>
   <p>"Like that, eh? I'll need – shoes?"</p>
   <p>"Yes."</p>
   <p>"I suppose –" Carmichael hesitated. "I guess you wouldn't tell me why?"</p>
   <p>"No, I won't do that. But be sure to wear them whenever you go out."</p>
   <p>"Don't worry about that. And – I'll mail you a check. It may take me a few days to scrape up the dough, but I'll do it. How much?"</p>
   <p>"Five hundred dollars."</p>
   <p>"I'll mail a check today."</p>
   <p>"I prefer not to accept a fee until the client has been satisfied," Talley said. He had grown more reserved, his blue eyes cool and withdrawn.</p>
   <p>"Suit yourself," Carmichael said. "I'm going out and celebrate. You – don't drink?"</p>
   <p>"I can't leave the shop."</p>
   <p>"Well, goodbye. And thanks again. I won't be any trouble to you, you know. I promise that!" He turned away.</p>
   <p>Looking after him, Talley smiled a wry, unhappy smile. He did not answer Carmichael's goodbye. Not then.</p>
   <p>When the door had closed behind him, Talley turned to the back of his shop and went through the door where the scanner was.</p>
   <p><emphasis>The lapse of ten years can cover a multitude of changes. A man with the possibility of tremendous power almost within his grasp can alter, in that time, from a man who will not reach for it to a man who will – and moral values be damned.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>The change did not come quickly to Carmichael. It speaks well for his integrity that it took ten years to work such an alteration in all he had been taught. On the day he first went into Talley's shop there was little evil in him. But the temptation grew stronger week by week, visit by visit. Talley, for reasons of his own, was content to sit idly by, waiting for customers, smothering the inconceivable potentialities of his machine under a blanket of trivial functions. But Carmichael was not content.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>It took him ten years to reach the day, but the day came at last.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Talley sat in the inner room, his back to the door. He was slumped low in an ancient rocker, facing the machine. It had changed little in the space of a decade. It still covered most of two walls, and the eyepiece of its scanner glittered under amber fluorescents.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Carmichael looked covetously at the eyepiece. It was window and doorway to a power beyond any man's dreams. Wealth beyond imagining lay just within that tiny opening. The rights over the life and death of every man alive. And nothing between that fabulous future and himself except the man who sat looking at the machine.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Talley did not seem to hear the careful footsteps or the creak of the door behind him. He did not stir as Carmichael lifted the gun slowly. One might think that he never guessed what was coming, or why, or from whom, as Carmichael shot him through the head.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Talley sighed and shivered a little, and twisted the scanner dial. It was not the first time that the eyepiece had shown him his own lifeless body, glimpsed down some vista of probability, but he never saw the slumping of that familiar figure without feeling a breath of indescribable coolness blow backwards upon him out of the future.</p>
   <p>He straightened from the eyepiece and sat back in his chair, looking thoughtfully at a pair of rough-soled shoes lying beside him on a table. He sat quietly for a while, his eyes upon the shoes, his mind following Carmichael down the street and into the evening, and the morrow, and on toward that coming crisis which would depend on his secure footing on a subway platform as a train thundered by the place where Carmichael would be standing one day next week.</p>
   <p>Talley had sent his messenger boy out this time for two pairs of shoes. He had hesitated long, an hour ago, between the rough-soled pair and the smooth. For Talley was a humane man, and there were many times when his job was distasteful to him. But in the end, this time, it had been the smooth-soled pair he had wrapped for Carmichael.</p>
   <p>Now he sighed and bent to the scanner again, twisting the dial to bring into view a scene he had watched before.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Carmichael, standing on a crowded subway platform, glittering with oily wetness from some overflow. Carmichael, in the slick-soled shoes Talley had chosen for him. A commotion in the crowd, a surge toward the platform edge. Carmichael's feet slipping frantically as the train roared by.</emphasis></p>
   <p>"Goodbye, Mr. Carmichael," Talley murmured. It was the farewell he had not spoken when Carmichael left the shop. He spoke it regretfully, and the regret was for the Carmichael of today, who did not yet deserve that end. He was not now a melodramatic villain whose death one could watch unmoved. But the Tim Carmichael of today had atonement to make for the Carmichael of ten years ahead, and the payment must be exacted.</p>
   <p>It is not a good thing to have the power of life and death over one's fellow humans. Peter Talley knew it was not a good thing – but the power had been put into his hands. He had not sought it. It seemed to him that the machine had grown almost by accident to its tremendous completion under his trained fingers and trained mind.</p>
   <p>At first it had puzzled him. How ought such a device to be used? What dangers, what terrible potentialities, lay in that Eye that could see through the veil of tomorrow? His was the responsibility, and it had weighed heavily upon him until the answer came. And after he knew the answer – well, the weight was heavier still. For Talley was a mild man.</p>
   <p>He could not have told anyone the real reason why he was a shopkeeper. Satisfaction, he had said to Carmichael. And sometimes, indeed, there was deep satisfaction. But at other times – at times like this – there was only dismay and humility. Especially humility.</p>
   <p><emphasis>We have what you need.</emphasis> Only Talley knew that message was not for the individuals who came to his shop. The pronoun was plural, not singular. It was a message for the world – the world whose future was being carefully, lovingly reshaped under Peter Talley's guidance.</p>
   <p>The main line of the future was not easy to alter. The future is a pyramid shaping slowly, brick by brick, and brick by brick Talley had to change it. There were some men who were necessary – men who would create and build – men who should be saved.</p>
   <p>Talley gave them what they needed.</p>
   <p>But inevitably there were others whose ends were evil. Talley gave them, too, what the world needed – death.</p>
   <p>Peter Talley had not asked for this terrible power. But the key had been put in his hands, and he dared not delegate such authority as this to any other man alive. Sometimes he made mistakes.</p>
   <p>He had felt a little surer since the simile of the key had occurred to him. The key to the future. A key that had been laid in his hands.</p>
   <p>Remembering that, he leaned back in his chair and reached for an old and well-worn book. It fell open easily at a familiar passage. Peter Talley's lips moved as he read the passage once again, in his room behind the shop on Park Avenue.</p>
   <p><emphasis>"And I say also unto thee, that thou art Peter ... And I will give unto thee the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven …"</emphasis></p>

    <p>PRIVATE EYE</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The forensic sociologist looked closely at the image on the wall screen. Two figures were frozen there, one in the act of stabbing the other through the heart with an antique letter cutter, once used at Johns Hopkins for surgery. That was before the ultra-microtome, of course.</p>
   <p>"As tricky a case as I've ever seen," the sociologist remarked. "If we can make a homicide charge stick on Sam Clay, I'll be a little surprised."</p>
   <p>The tracer engineer twirled a dial and watched the figures on the screen repeat their actions. One – Sam Clay – snatched the letter cutter from a desk and plunged it into the other man's heart. The victim fell down dead. Clay started back in apparent horror. Then he dropped to his knees beside the twitching body and said wildly that he didn't mean it. The body drummed its heels upon the rug and was still.</p>
   <p>"That last touch was nice," the engineer said.</p>
   <p>"Well, I've got to make the preliminary survey," the sociolo­gist sighed, settling in his dictachair and placing his fingers on the keyboard. "I doubt if I'll find any evidence. However, the analysis can come later. Where's Clay now?"</p>
   <p>"His mouthpiece put in a <emphasis>habeas mens</emphasis>."</p>
   <p>"I didn't think we'd be able to hold him. But it was worth trying. Imagine, just one shot of scop and he'd have told the truth. Ah, well. We'll do it the hard way, as usual. Start the tracer, will you? It won't make sense till we run it chronologically, but one must start somewhere. Good old Blackstone," the sociolo­gist said, as, on the screen, Clay stood up, watching the corpse revive and arise, and then pulled the miraculously clean paper cutter out of its heart, all in reverse.</p>
   <p>"Good old Blackstone," he repeated. "On the other hand, sometimes I wish I'd lived in Jeffreys' time. In those days, homicide was homicide."</p>
   <p>Telepathy never came to much. Perhaps the developing faculty went underground in response to a familiar natural law after the new science appeared omniscience. It wasn't really that, of course. It was a device for looking into the past. And it was limited to a fifty-year span; no chance of seeing the arrows at Agincourt or the homunculi of Bacon. It was sensitive enough to pick up the "fingerprints" of light and sound waves imprinted on matter, descramble and screen them, and reproduce the image of what had happened. After all, a man's shadow can be photo­graphed on concrete, if he's unlucky enough to be caught in an atomic blast. Which is something. The shadow's about all here is left.</p>
   <p>However, opening the past like a book didn't solve all problems. It took generations for the maze of complexities to iron itself out, though finally a tentative check-and-balance was reached. The right to kill has been sturdily defended by mankind since Cain rose up against Abel. A good many idealists quoted, "The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground," but that didn't stop the lobbyists and the pressure groups. Magna Carta was quoted in reply. The right to privacy was defended desperately.</p>
   <p>And the curious upshot of this imbalance came when the act of homicide was declared nonpunishable, unless intent and fore­thought could be proved. Of course, it was considered at least naughty to fly in a rage and murder someone on impulse, and there was a nominal punishment – imprisonment, for example – but in practice this never worked, because so many defenses were possible. Temporary insanity. Undue provocation. Self-defense. Manslaughter, second-degree homicide, third degree, fourth degree – it went on like that. It was up to the State to prove that the killer had planned his killing in advance; only then would a jury convict. And the jury, of course, had to waive immunity and take a scop test, to prove the box hadn't been packed. But no defendant ever waived immunity.</p>
   <p>A man's home wasn't his castle – not with the Eye able to enter it at will and scan his past. The device couldn't interpret, and it couldn't read his mind; it could only see and listen. Consequently the sole remaining fortress of privacy was de­fended to the last ditch. No truth-serum, no hypnoanalysis, no third-degree, no leading questions.</p>
   <p>If, by viewing the prisoner's past actions, the prosecution could prove forethought and intent, O.K.</p>
   <p>Otherwise, Sam Clay would go scot-free. Superficially, it appeared as though Andrew Vanderman had, during a quarrel, struck Clay across the face with a stingaree whip. Anyone who has been stung by a Portuguese man-of-war can understand that, at this point, Clay could plead temporary insanity and self-defense, as well as undue provocation and possible justification.</p>
   <p>Only the curious cult of the Alaskan Flagellantes, who make the stingaree whips for their ceremonials, know how to endure the pain. The Flagellantes even like it, the pre-ritual drug they swallow transmutes pain into pleasure. Not having swallowed this drug, Sam Clay very naturally took steps to protect himself – irrational steps, perhaps, but quite logical and defensible ones.</p>
   <p>Nobody but Clay knew that he had intended to kill Vanderman all along. That was the trouble. Clay couldn't understand why he felt so let down.</p>
   <p>The screen flickered. It went dark. The engineer chuckled.</p>
   <p>"My, my. Locked up in a dark closet at the age of four. What one of those old-time psychiatrists would have made of that. Or do I mean obimen? Shamans? I forget. They interpreted dreams, anyway. "</p>
   <p>"You're confused. It –"</p>
   <p>"Astrologers! No, it wasn't either. The ones I mean went in for symbolism. They used to spin prayer wheels and say 'A rose is a rose is a rose,' didn’t they? To free the unconscious mind?"</p>
   <p>"You've got the typical layman's attitude toward antique psychiatric treatments."</p>
   <p>"Well, maybe they had something, at that. Look at quinine and digitalis. The United Amazon natives used those long before science discovered them. But why use eye of newt and toe of frog? To impress the patient?"</p>
   <p>"No, to convince themselves," the Sociologist said. "In those days the study of mental aberrations drew potential psychotics, so naturally there was unnecessary mumbo-jumbo. Those medi­cos were trying to fix their own mental imbalance while they treated their patients. But it's a science today, not a religion. We've found out how to allow for individual psychotic deviation in the psychiatrist himself, so we've got a better chance of finding true north. However, let's get on with this. Try ultraviolet. Oh, never mind. Somebody's letting him out of that closet. The devil with it. I think we've cut back far enough. Even if he was frightened by a thunderstorm at the age of three months, that can be filed under Gestalt and ignored. Let's run through this chronologically. Give it the screening for … let's see. Incidents involving these persons: Vanderman, Mrs. Vanderman, Josephine Wells – and these places: the office, Vanderman's apartment. Clay's place –"</p>
   <p>"Got it."</p>
   <p>"Later we can recheck for complicating factors. Right now we'll run the superficial survey. Verdict first, evidence later," he added, with a grin. "All we need is a motive –"</p>
   <p>"What about this?"</p>
   <p>A girl was talking to Sam Clay. The background was an apartment, grade B-2.</p>
   <p>"I'm sorry, Sam. It's just that … well, these things happen."</p>
   <p>"Yeah. Vanderman's got something I haven't got, apparently."</p>
   <p>"I'm in love with him."</p>
   <p>"Funny. I thought all along you were in love with me."</p>
   <p>"So did I ... for a while."</p>
   <p>"Well, forget it. No, I'm not angry, Bea. I'll even wish you luck. But you must have been pretty certain how I'd react to this."</p>
   <p>"I'm sorry –"</p>
   <p>"Come to think of it, I've always let you call the shots. Always."</p>
   <p>Secretly – and this the screen could not show – he thought: Let her? I wanted it that way. It was so much easier to leave the decisions up to her. Sure, she's dominant, but I guess I'm just the opposite. And now it's happened again.</p>
   <p>It always happens. I was loaded with weight-cloths from the start. And I always felt I had to toe the line, or else. Vanderman – that cocky, arrogant air of his. Reminds me of somebody. I was locked up in a dark place, I couldn't breathe. I forget. What … who ... my father. No, I don't remember. But my life's been like that. He always watched me, and I always thought some day I'd do what I wanted! – but I never did. Too late now. He's been dead quite a while.</p>
   <p>He was always so sure I'd knuckle under. If I'd only defied him once –</p>
   <p>Somebody's always pushing me in and closing the door. So I can't use my abilities. I can't prove I'm competent. Prove it to myself, to my father, to Bea, to the whole world. If only I could – I'd like to push Vanderman into a dark place and lock the door. A dark place, like a coffin. It would be satisfying to surprise him that way. It would be fine if I killed Andrew Vanderman.</p>
   <p>"Well, that's the beginning of a motive," the sociologist said. "Still, lots of people get jilted and don't turn homicidal. Carry on."</p>
   <p>"In my opinion, Bea attracted him because he wanted to be bossed," the engineer remarked. "He'd given up."</p>
   <p>"Protective passivity."</p>
   <p>The wire taps spun through the screening apparatus. A new scene showed on the oblong panel. It was the Paradise Bar.</p>
   <p>Anywhere you sat in the Paradise Bar, a competent robot analyzer instantly studied your complexion and facial angles, and switched on lights, in varying tints and intensities, that showed you off to best advantage. The joint was popular for business deals. A swindler could look like an honest man there. It was also popular with women and slightly passé teleo talent. Sam Clay looked rather like an ascetic young saint. Andrew Vanderman looked noble, in a grim way, like Richard Coeur-de-Lion offer­ing Saladin his freedom, though he knew it wasn’t really a bright thing to do. <emphasis>Noblesse oblige</emphasis>, his firm jaw seemed to say, as he picked up the silver decanter and poured. In ordinary light, Vanderman looked slightly more like a handsome bulldog. Also, away from the Paradise Bar, he was redder around the chops, a choleric man.</p>
   <p>"As to that deal we were discussing," Clay said, "you can go to –"</p>
   <p>The censoring juke box blared out a covering bar or two.</p>
   <p>Vanderman's reply was unheard as the music got briefly louder, and the lights shifted rapidly to keep pace with his sudden flush.</p>
   <p>"It's perfectly easy to outwit these censors," Clay said. "They're keyed to familiar terms of profane abuse, not to circumlocutions. If I said that the arrangement of your chromosomes would have surprised your father … you see?" He was right. The music stayed soft.</p>
   <p>Vanderman swallowed nothing. "Take it easy," he said. "I can see why you're upset. Let me say first of all –"</p>
   <p>"Hijo –"</p>
   <p>But the censor was proficient in Spanish dialects. Vanderman was spared hearing another insult.</p>
   <p>"– that I offered you a job because I think you're a very capable man. You have potentialities. It's not a bribe. Our personal affairs should be kept out of this."</p>
   <p>"All the same, Bea was engaged to me."</p>
   <p>"Clay, are you drunk?"</p>
   <p>"Yes," Clay said, and threw his drink into Vanderman's face. The music began to play Wagner very, very loudly. A few minutes later, when the waiters interfered. Clay was supine and bloody, with a mashed nose and a bruised check. Vanderman had skinned his knuckles.</p>
   <p>"That's a motive," the engineer said.</p>
   <p>"Yes, it is, isn't it? But why did Clay wait a year and a half? And remember what happened later. I wonder if the murder itself was just a symbol? If Vanderman represented, say, what Clay considered the tyrannical and oppressive force of society in general – synthesized in the representative image … oh, nonsense. Obviously Clay was trying to prove something to himself though. Suppose you cut forward now. I want to see this in normal chronology, not backwards. What's the next selection?"</p>
   <p>"Very suspicious. Clay got his nose fixed up and then went to a murder trial."</p>
   <p>He thought: I can't breathe. Too crowded in here. Shut up in a box, a closet, a coffin, ignored by the spectators and the vested authority on the bench. What would I do if I were in the dock, like that chap? Suppose they convicted? That would spoil it all. Another dark place – If I’d inherited the right genes, I’d have been strong enough to beat up Vanderman. But I've been pushed around too long.</p>
   <p>I keep remembering that song.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Stray in the herd and the boss said kill it,</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>So I shot him in the rump with the handle of a skillet.</emphasis></p>
   <p>A deadly weapon that's in normal usage wouldn't appear dangerous. But if it could be used homicidally – No, the Eye could check on that. All you can conceal these days is motive. But couldn't the trick be reversed. Suppose I got Vanderman to attack me with what he thought was the handle of a skillet, but which I knew was a deadly weapon –</p>
   <p>The trial Sam Clay was watching was fairly routine. One man had killed another. Counsel for the defense contended that the homicide had been a matter of impulse, and that, as a matter of fact, only assault and battery plus culpable negligence, at worst, could be proved, and the latter was canceled by an Act of God. The fact that the defendant inherited the decedent's fortune, in Martial oil, made no difference. Temporary insanity was the plea.</p>
   <p>The prosecuting attorney showed films of what had happened before the fact. True, the victim hadn't been killed by the blow, merely stunned. But the affair had occurred on an isolated beach, and when the tide came in –</p>
   <p>Act of God, the defense repeated hastily.</p>
   <p>The screen showed the defendant, some days before his crime, looking up the tide-table in a news tape. He also, it appeared, visited the site and asked a passing stranger if the beach was often crowded. "Nope," the stranger said, "it ain't crowded after sundown. Gits too cold. Won't do you no good, though. Too cold to swim then."</p>
   <p>One side matched <emphasis>Actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea</emphasis> – "The act does not make a man guilty, unless the mind be also guilty" – against <emphasis>Acta exteriora indicant interiora secreta</emphasis> – "By the outward acts we are to judge of the inward thoughts." Latin legal basics were still valid, up to a point. A man's past remained sacrosanct, provided – and here was the joker – that he possessed the right of citizenship. And anyone accused of a capital crime was automatically suspended from citizenship until his innocence had been established.</p>
   <p>Also, no past-tracing evidence could be introduced into a trial unless it could be proved that it had direct connection with the crime. The average citizen did have a right of privacy against tracing. Only if accused of a serious crime was that forfeit, and even then evidence uncovered could be used only in correlation with the immediate charge. There were various loopholes, of course, but theoretically a man was safe from espionage as long as he stayed within the law.</p>
   <p>Now a defendant stood in the dock, his past opened. The prosecution showed recordings of a ginger blonde blackmailing him, and that clinched the motive and the verdict – guilty. The condemned man was led off in tears. Clay got up and walked out of the court. From his appearance, he seemed to be thinking.</p>
   <p>He was. He had decided that there was only one possible way in which he could kill Vanderman and get away with it. He couldn't conceal the deed itself, nor the actions leading up to it, nor any written or spoken word. All he could hide were his own thoughts. And, without otherwise betraying himself, he'd have to kill Vanderman so that his act would appear justified. Which meant covering his tracks for yesterday as well as for tomorrow and tomorrow.</p>
   <p>Now, thought Clay, this much can be assumed; if I stand to lose by Vanderman's death instead of gaining, that will help considerably. I must juggle that somehow. But I mustn't forget that at present I have an obvious motive. First, he stole Bea. Second, he beat me up.</p>
   <p>So I must make it seem as though he's done me a favor – somehow.</p>
   <p>I must have an opportunity to study Vanderman carefully, and it must be a normal, logical, waterproof opportunity. Private secretary. Something like that. The Eye's in the future now, after the fact, but it's watching me –</p>
   <p>I must remember that. <emphasis>It's watching me now!</emphasis></p>
   <p>All right. Normally, I'd have thought of murder, at this point. That can't and shouldn't be disguised. I must work out of the mood gradually, but meanwhile –</p>
   <p>He smiled.</p>
   <p>Going off to buy a gun, he felt uncomfortable, as though that prescient Eye, years in the future, could with a wink summon the police. But it was separated from him by a barrier of time that only the natural processes could shorten. And, in fact, it had been watching him since his birth. You could look at it that way –</p>
   <p>He could defy it. The Eye couldn't read thoughts.</p>
   <p>He bought the gun and lay in wait for Vanderman in a dark alley. But first he got thoroughly drunk. Drunk enough to satisfy the Eye.</p>
   <p>After that –</p>
   <p>"Feel better now?" Vanderman asked, pouring another coffee.</p>
   <p>Clay buried his face in his hands.</p>
   <p>"I was crazy," he said, his voice muffled. "I must have been. You'd better t-turn me over to the police."</p>
   <p>"We can forget about that end of it, Clay. You were drunk, that's all. And I … well, I –"</p>
   <p>"I pull a gun on you ... try to kill you … and you bring me up to your place and –"</p>
   <p>"You didn't use that gun, Clay. Remember that. You're no killer. All this has been my fault. I needn't have been so blasted tough with you," Vanderman said, looking like Coeur-de-Lion in spite of uncalculated amber fluorescence.</p>
   <p>"I'm no good. I'm a failure. Every time I try to do something, a man like you comes along and does it better. I'm a second-rater."</p>
   <p>"Clay, stop talking like that. You're just upset, that's all. Listen to me. You're going to straighten up. I'm going to see that you do. Starting tomorrow, we'll work something out. Now drink your coffee."</p>
   <p>"You know," Clay said, "you're quite a guy."</p>
   <p>So the magnanimous idiot's fallen for it, Clay thought, as he was drifting happily off to sleep. Fine. That begins to take care of the Eye. Moreover, it starts the ball rolling with Vanderman. Let a man do you a favor and he's your pal. Well, Vanderman's going to do me a lot more favors. In fact, before I'm through, I'll have every motive for wanting to keep him alive.</p>
   <p>Every motive visible to the naked Eye.</p>
   <p>Probably Clay had not heretofore applied his talents in the right direction, for there was nothing second-rate about the way he executed his homicide plan. In that, he proved very capable. He needed a suitable channel for his ability, and perhaps he needed a patron. Vanderman fulfilled that function; probably it salved his conscience for stealing Bea. Being the man he was, Vanderman needed to avoid even the appearance of ignobility. Naturally strong and ruthless, he told himself he was sentimental. His sentimentality never reached the point of actually incon­veniencing him, and Clay knew enough to stay within the limits.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless it is nerve-racking to know you're living under the scrutiny of an extratemporal Eye. As he walked into the lobby of the V Building a month later, Clay realized that light-vibrations reflected from his own body were driving irretrievably into the polished onyx walls and floor, photographing themselves there, waiting for a machine to unlock them, some day, some time, for some man perhaps in this very city, who as yet didn't know even the name of Sam Clay. Then, sitting in his relaxer in the spiral lift moving swiftly up inside the walls, he knew that those walls were capturing his image, stealing it, like some superstition he remembered … ah?</p>
   <p>Vanderman's private secretary greeted him. Clay let his gaze wander freely across that young person's neatly dressed figure and mildly attractive face. She said that Mr. Vanderman was out, and the appointment was for three, not two, wasn't it? Clay referred to a notebook. He snapped his fingers.</p>
   <p>"Three – you're right, Miss Wells. I was so sure it was two I didn't even bother to check up. Do you think he might be back sooner? I mean, is he out, or in conference?"</p>
   <p>"He’s out, all right, Mr. Clay," Miss Wells said. "I don't think he'll be back much sooner than three. I'm sorry."</p>
   <p>"Well, may I wait in here?"</p>
   <p>She smiled at him efficiently. "Of course. There's a stereo and the magazine spools are in that case."</p>
   <p>She went back to her work, and Clay skimmed through an article about the care and handling of lunar filchards. It gave him an opportunity to start a conversation by asking Miss Wells if she liked filchards. It turned out that she had no opinion whatso­ever of filchards but the ice had been broken.</p>
   <p>This is the cocktail acquaintance, Clay thought. I may have a broken heart, but, naturally, I'm lonesome.</p>
   <p>The trick wasn't to get engaged to Miss Wells so much as to fall in love with her convincingly. The Eye never slept. Clay was beginning to wake at night with a nervous start, and lie there looking up at the ceiling. But darkness was no shield.</p>
   <p>"The question is," said the sociologist at this point, "whether or not Clay was acting for an audience."</p>
   <p>"You mean us?"</p>
   <p>"Exactly. It just occurred to me. Do you think he's been behaving perfectly naturally?"</p>
   <p>The engineer pondered.</p>
   <p>"I'd say yes. A man doesn't marry a girl only to carry out some other plan, does he? After all, he'd get himself involved in a whole new batch of responsibilities."</p>
   <p>"Clay hasn't married Josephine Wells yet, however," the sociologist countered. "Besides, that responsibility angle might have applied a few hundred years ago, but not now." He went off at random. "Imagine a society where, after divorce, a man was forced to support a perfectly healthy, competent woman! It was vestigial, I know – a throwback to the days when only males could earn a living – but imagine the sort of women who were willing to accept such support. That was reversion to infancy if I ever –"</p>
   <p>The engineer coughed.</p>
   <p>"Oh," the sociologist said. “Oh … yes. The question is, would Clay have got himself engaged to a woman unless he really –"</p>
   <p>"Engagements can be broken."</p>
   <p>"This one hasn't been broken yet, as far as we know. And <emphasis>we know</emphasis>."</p>
   <p>"A normal man wouldn't plan on marrying a girl he didn't care anything about, unless he had some stronger motive – I'll go along that far."</p>
   <p>"But how normal is Clay?" the sociologist wondered. "Did he know in advance we'd check back on his past? Did you notice that he cheated at solitaire?"</p>
   <p>"Proving?"</p>
   <p>"There are all kinds of trivial things you don't do if you think people are looking. Picking up a penny in the street, drinking soup out of the bowl, posing before a mirror – the sort of foolish or petty things everyone does when alone. Either Clay's innocent, or he's a very clever man –"</p>
   <p>He was a very clever man. He never intended the engagement to get as far as marriage, though he knew that in one respect marriage would be a precaution. If a man talks in his sleep, his wife will certainly mention the fact. Clay considered gagging himself at night if the necessity should arise. Then he realized that if he talked in his sleep at all, there was no insurance against talking too much the very first time he had an auditor. He couldn't risk such a break. But there was no necessity, after all. Clay's problem, when he thought it over, was simply: How can I be sure I don't talk in my sleep?</p>
   <p>He solved that easily enough by renting a narcohypnotic sup­plementary course in common trade dialects. This involved study­ing while awake and getting the information repeated in his ear during slumber. As a necessary preparation for the course, he was instructed to set up a recorder and chart the depth of his sleep, so the narcohypnosis could be keyed to his individual rhythms. He did this several times, rechecked once a month thereafter, and was satisfied. There was no need to gag himself at night.</p>
   <p>He was glad to sleep provided he didn't dream. He had to take sedatives after a while. At night, there was relief from the knowledge that an Eye watched him always, an Eye that could bring him to justice, an Eye whose omnipotence he could not challenge in the open. But he dreamed about the Eye.</p>
   <p>Vanderman had given him a job in the organization, which was enormous. Clay was merely a cog, which suited him well enough, for the moment. He didn't want any more favors yet. Not till he had found out the extent of Miss Wells' duties – Josephine, her Christian name was. That took several months, but by that time friendship was ripening into affection. So Clay asked Vanderman for another job. He specified. It wasn't obvious, but he was asking for work that would, presently, fit him for Miss Wells' duties.</p>
   <p>Vanderman probably still felt guilty about Bea; he'd married her and she was in Antarctica now, at the Casino. Vanderman was due to join her, so he scribbled a memorandum, wished Clay good luck, and went to Antarctica, bothered by no stray pangs of conscience. Clay improved the hour by courting Jose­phine ardently.</p>
   <p>From what he had heard about the new Mrs. Vanderman, he felt secretly relieved. Not long ago, when he had been content to remain passive, the increasing dominance of Bea would have satisfied him, but no more. He was learning self reliance, and liked it. These days, Bea was behaving rather badly. Given all the money and freedom she could use, she had too much time on her hands. Once in a while Clay heard rumors that made him smile secretly. Vanderman wasn't having an easy time of it. A dominant character, Bea – but Vanderman was no weakling himself.</p>
   <p>After a while Clay told his employer he wanted to marry Josephine Wells. "I guess that makes us square," he said. "You took Bea away from me and I'm taking Josie away from you."</p>
   <p>"Now wait a minute," Vanderman said. "I hope you don't –"</p>
   <p>"My fiancée, your secretary. That's all. The thing is, Josie and I are in love." He poured it on, but carefully. It was easier to deceive Vanderman than the Eye, with its trained technicians and forensic sociologists looking through it. He thought, sometime, of those medieval pictures of an immense eye, and that reminded him of something vague and distressing, though he couldn't isolate the memory.</p>
   <p>After all, what could Vanderman do? He arranged to have Clay given a raise. Josphine, always conscientious, offered to keep on working for a while, till office routine was straightened out, but it never did get straightened out, somehow. Clay deftly saw to that by keeping Josephine busy. She didn't have to bring work home to her apartment, but she brought it, and Clay gradually began to help her when he dropped by. His job, plus the narcohypnotic courses, had already trained him for this sort of tricky organizational work. Vanderman's business was highly specialized – planet-wide exports and imports, and what with keeping track of specific groups, seasonal trends, sectarian holidays, and so forth, Josephine, as a sort of animated memorandum book for Vanderman, had a more than full-time job.</p>
   <p>She and Clay postponed marriage for a time. Clay – naturally enough – began to appear mildly jealous of Josephine's work, and she said she'd quit soon. But one night she stayed on at the office, and he went out in a pet and got drunk. It just happened to be raining that night, Clay got tight enough to walk unprotected through the drizzle, and to fall asleep at home in his wet clothes. He came down with influenza. As he was recovering, Josephine got it.</p>
   <p>Under the circumstances, Clay stepped in – purely a temporary job – and took over his fiancée's duties. Office routine was extremely complicated that week, and only Clay knew the ins and outs of it. The arrangement saved Vanderman a certain amount of inconvenience, and, when the situation resolved itself, Josephine had a subsidiary job and Clay was Vanderman’s private secretary.</p>
   <p>"I'd better know more about him," Clay said to Josephine. "After all, there must be a lot of habits and foibles he's got that need to be catered to. If he wants lunch ordered up, I don't want to get smoked tongue and find out he's allergic to it. What about his hobbies?"</p>
   <p>But he was careful not to pump Josephine too hard, because of the Eye. He still needed sedatives to sleep.</p>
   <p>The sociologist rubbed his forehead.</p>
   <p>"Let's take a break," he suggested. "Why does a guy want to commit murder anyway?"</p>
   <p>"For profit, one sort or another."</p>
   <p>"Only partly, I'd say. The other part is an unconscious desire to be punished – usually for something else. That's why you get accident prones. Ever think about what happens to murderers who feel guilty and yet who aren't punished by the Law? They must live a rotten sort of life – always stepping in front of speedsters, cutting themselves with an ax – accidentally; acciden­tally touching wires full of juice –"</p>
   <p>"Conscience, eh?"</p>
   <p>"A long time ago, people thought God sat in the sky with a telescope and watched everything they did. They really lived pretty carefully, in the Middle Ages – the first Middle Ages, I mean. Then there was the era of disbelief, where people had nothing to believe in very strongly – and finally we get this." He nodded toward the screen. "A universal memory. By extension, it's a universal social conscience, an externalized one. It's ex­actly the same as the medieval concept of God – omniscience."</p>
   <p>"But not omnipotence."</p>
   <p>"Mm."</p>
   <p>All in all, Clay kept the Eye in mind for a year and a half. Before he said or did anything whatsoever, he reminded himself of the Eye, and made certain that he wasn't revealing his motive to the judging future. Of course, there was – would be – an Ear, too, but that was a little too absurd. One couldn't visualize a large, disembodied Ear decorating the wall like a plate in a plate holder. All the same, whatever he said would be as important evidence – some time – as what he did. So Sam Clay was very careful indeed, and behaved like Caesar's wife. He wasn't ex­actly defying authority, but he was certainly circumventing it.</p>
   <p>Superficially Vanderman was more like Caesar, and his wife was not above reproach, these days. She had too much money to play with. And she was finding her husband too stony willed a person to be completely satisfactory. There was enough of the matriarch in Bea to make her feel rebellion against Andrew Vanderman, and there was a certain lack of romance. Vanderman had little time for her. He was busy these days, involved with a whole string of deals which demanded much of his time. Clay, of course, had something to do with that. His interest in his new work was most laudable. He stayed up nights plotting and plan­ning as though expecting Vanderman to make him a full partner. In fact, he even suggested this possibility to Josephine. He wanted it on the record. The marriage date had been set, and Clay wanted to move before then; he had no intention of being drawn into a marriage of convenience after the necessity had been removed.</p>
   <p>One thing he did, which had to be handled carefully, was to get the whip. Now Vanderman was a fingerer. He liked to have something in his hands while he talked. Usually it was a crystal­line paper weight, with a miniature thunderstorm in it, complete with lightning, when it was shaken. Clay put this where Vanderman would be sure to knock it off and break it. Meanwhile, he had plugged one deal with Callisto Ranches for the sole purpose of getting a whip for Vanderman's desk. The natives were proud of their leatherwork and their silversmithing, and a nominal make­weight always went with every deal they closed. Thus, presently, a handsome miniature whip, with Vanderman's initials on it, lay on the desk, coiled into a loop, acting as a paperweight except when he picked it up and played with it while he talked.</p>
   <p>The other weapon Clay wanted was already there – an antique paper knife, once called a surgical scalpel. He never let his gaze rest on it too long, because of the Eye.</p>
   <p>The other whip came. He absentmindedly put it in his desk and pretended to forget it. It was a sample of the whips made by the Alaskan Flagellantes for use in their ceremonies, and was wanted because of some research being made into the pain-neutralizing drugs the Flagellantes used. Clay, of course, had engineered this deal, too. There was nothing suspicious about that; the firm stood to make a sound profit. In fact, Vanderman had promised him a percentage bonus at the end of the year on every deal he triggered. It would be quite a lot. It was December, a year and a half had passed since Clay first recognized that the Eye would seek him out.</p>
   <p>He felt fine. He was careful about the sedatives, and his nerves, though jangled, were nowhere near the snapping point. It had been a strain, but he had trained himself so that he would make no slips. He visualized the Eye in the walls, in the ceiling, in the sky, everywhere he went. It was the only way to play completely safe. And very soon now it would pay off. But he would have to do it soon; such a nervous strain could not be continued indefinitely.</p>
   <p>A few details remained. He carefully arranged matters – under the Eye's very nose, so to speak – so that he was offered a well-paying position with another firm. He turned it down.</p>
   <p>And one night an emergency happened to arise so that Clay, very logically, had to go to Vanderman's apartment.</p>
   <p>Vanderman wasn't there; Bea was. She had quarreled vio­lently with her husband. Moreover, she had been drinking. (This, too, he had expected.) If the situation had not worked out exactly as he wanted, he would have tried again – and again – but there was no need.</p>
   <p>Clay was a little politer than necessary. Perhaps too polite, certainly Bea, that incipient matriarch, was led down the garden path, a direction she was not unwilling to take. After all, she had married Vanderman for his money, found him as dominant as herself, and now saw Clay as an exaggerated symbol of both romance and masculine submissiveness.</p>
   <p>The camera eye hidden in the wall, in a decorative bas-relief, was grinding away busily, spooling up its wiretape in a way that indicated Vanderman was a suspicious as well as a jealous husband. But Clay knew about this gadget, too. At the suitable moment he stumbled against the wall in such a fashion that the device broke. Then, with only that other eye spying on him, he suddenly became so virtuous that it was a pity Vanderman couldn't witness his <emphasis>volte face</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>"Listen, Bea," he said, "I'm sorry, but I didn't understand. It's no good. I'm not in love with you anymore. I was once, sure, but that was quite a while ago. There's somebody else, and you ought to know it by now."</p>
   <p>"You still love me," Bea said with intoxicated firmness. "We belong together."</p>
   <p>"Bea. Please. I hate to have to say this, but I'm grateful to Andrew Vanderman for marrying you, I … well, you got what you wanted, and I'm getting what I want. Let's leave it at that."</p>
   <p>"I'm used to getting what I want, Sam. Opposition is some­thing I don't like. Especially when I know you really –"</p>
   <p>She said a good deal more, and so did Clay – he was perhaps unnecessarily harsh. But he had to make the point, for the Eye, that he was no longer jealous of Vanderman.</p>
   <p>He made the point.</p>
   <p>The next morning he got to the office before Vanderman, cleaned up his desk, and discovered the stingaree whip still in its box. "Oops," he said, snapping his fingers – the Eye watched, and this was the crucial period. Perhaps it would all be over within the hour. Every move from now on would have to be specially calculated in advance, and there could be no slightest deviation. The Eye was everywhere – literally everywhere.</p>
   <p>He opened the box, took out the whip, and went into the inner sanctum. He tossed the whip on Vanderman's desk, so carelessly that a stylus rack toppled. Clay rearranged everything, leaving the stingaree whip near the edge of the desk, and placing the Callistan silver-leather whip at the back, half concealed behind the interoffice visor-box. He didn't allow himself more than a casual sweeping glance to make sure the paper knife was still there.</p>
   <p>Then he went out for coffee.</p>
   <p>Half an hour later he got back, picked up a few letters for signature from the rack, and walked into Vanderman's office. Vanderman looked up from behind his desk. He had changed a little in a year and a half; he was looking older, less noble, more like an aging bulldog. Once, Clay thought coldly, this man stole my fiancée and beat me up.</p>
   <p>Careful. Remember the Eye.</p>
   <p>There was no need to do anything but follow the plan and let events take their course. Vanderman had seen the spy films, all right, up to the point where they had gone blank, when Clay fell against the wall. Obviously he hadn't really expected Clay to show up this morning. But to see the louse grinning hello, walking across the room, putting some letters down on his desk –</p>
   <p>Clay was counting on Vanderman's short temper, which had not improved over the months. Obviously the man had been simply sitting there, thinking unpleasant thoughts, and just as Clay had known would happen, he'd picked up the whip and begun to finger it. But it was the stingaree whip this time.</p>
   <p>"Morning," Clay said cheerfully to his stunned employer. His smile became one-sided. "I've been waiting for you to check this letter to the Kirghiz kovar-breeders. Can we find a market for two thousand of those ornamental horns?"</p>
   <p>It was at this point that Vanderman, bellowing, jumped to his feet, swung the whip, and sloshed Clay across the face. There is probably nothing more painful than the bite of a stingaree whip.</p>
   <p>Clay staggered back.  He had not known it would hurt so much. For an instant the shock of the blow knocked every other consideration out of his head, and blind anger was all that remained.</p>
   <p>Remember the Eye!</p>
   <p>He remembered it. There were dozens of trained men watch­ing everything he did just now. Literally he stood on an open stage surrounded by intent observers who made notes on every expression of his face, every muscular flection, every breath he drew.</p>
   <p>In a moment Vanderman would be dead – but Sam Clay would not be alone. An invisible audience from the future was fixing him with cold, calculating eyes. He had one more thing to do and the job would be over. Do it – carefully, carefully! – while they watched.</p>
   <p>Time stopped for him. <emphasis>The job would be over.</emphasis></p>
   <p>It was very curious. He had rehearsed this series of actions so often in the privacy of his mind that his body was going through with it now, without further instructions. His body staggered back from the blow, recovered balance, glared at Vanderman in shocked fury, poised for a dive at that paper knife in plain sight on the desk.</p>
   <p>That was what the outward and visible Sam Clay was doing. But the inward and spiritual Sam Clay went through quite a different series of actions.</p>
   <p><emphasis>The job would be over.</emphasis></p>
   <p>And what was he going to do after that?</p>
   <p>The inward and spiritual murderer stood fixed with dismay and surprise, staring at a perfectly empty future. He had never looked beyond this moment. He had made no plans for his life beyond the death of Vanderman. But now – he had no enemy but Vanderman. When Vanderman was dead, what would he fix upon to orient his life? What would he work at then? His job would be gone, too. And he liked his job.</p>
   <p>Suddenly he knew how much he liked it. He was good at it. For the first time in his life, he had found a job he could do really well.</p>
   <p>You can't live a year and a half in a new environment without acquiring new goals. The change had come imperceptibly. He was a good operator; he'd discovered that he could be successful. He didn't have to kill Vanderman to prove that to himself. He'd proved it already without committing murder.</p>
   <p>In that time-stasis which had brought everything to a full stop he looked lit Vanderman's red face and he thought of Bea, and of Vanderman as he had come to know him – and he didn't want to be a murderer.</p>
   <p>He didn't want Vanderman dead. He didn't want Bea. The thought of her made him feel a little sick. Perhaps that was because he himself had changed from passive to active. He no longer wanted or needed a dominant woman. He could make his own decisions. If he were choosing now, it would be someone more like Josephine –</p>
   <p>Josephine. That image before his mind's stilled eye was sud­denly very pleasant. Josephine with her mild, calm prettiness, her admiration for Sam Clay the successful businessman, the rising young importer in Vanderman, Inc. Josephine whom he was going to marry – Of course he was going to marry her. He loved Josephine. He loved his job. All he wanted was the status quo, exactly as he had achieved it. Everything was perfect right now – as of maybe thirty seconds ago.</p>
   <p>But that was a long time ago – thirty seconds. A lot can happen in a half a minute. A lot had happened. Vanderman was coming at him again, the whip raised. Clay's nerves crawled at the anticipation of its burning impact across his face a second time. If he could get hold of Vanderman's wrist before he struck again – if he could talk fast enough –</p>
   <p>The crooked smile was still on his face. It was part of the pattern, in some dim way he did not quite understand. He was acting in response to conditioned reflexes set up over a period of many months of rigid self-training. His body was already in action. All that had taken place in his mind had happened so fast there was no physical hiatus at all. His body knew its job and it was doing the job. It was lunging forward toward the desk and the knife, and he could not stop it.</p>
   <p>All this had happened before. It had happened in his mind, the only place where Sam Clay had known real freedom in the past year and a half. In all that time he had forced himself to realize that the Eye was watching every outward move he made. He had planned each action in advance and schooled himself to carry it through. Scarcely once had he let himself act purely on impulse. Only in following the plan exactly was there safety. He had indoctrinated himself too successfully.</p>
   <p>Something was wrong. This wasn't what he'd wanted. He was still afraid, weak, failing –</p>
   <p>He lurched against the desk, clawed at the paper knife, and, knowing failure, drove it into Vanderman's heart.</p>
   <p>"It's a tricky case," the forensic sociologist said to the engineer. "Very tricky."</p>
   <p>"Want me to run it again?"</p>
   <p>"No, not right now. I'd like to think it over. Clay … that firm that offered him another job. The offer's withdrawn now, isn't it? Yes, I remember – they're fussy about the morals of their employees. It's insurance or something, I don't know. Motive. Motive, now."</p>
   <p>The sociologist looked at the engineer.</p>
   <p>The engineer said: "A year and a half ago he had a motive. But a week ago he had everything to lose and nothing to gain. He's lost his job and that bonus, he doesn't want Mrs. Vanderman anymore, and as for that beating Vanderman once gave him … ah?"</p>
   <p>"Well, he did try to shoot Vanderman once, and he couldn't, remember? Even though he was full of Dutch courage. But – something's wrong. Clay's been avoiding even the appearance of evil a little too carefully. Only I can't put my finger on anything, blast it."</p>
   <p>"What about tracing back his life further? We only got to his fourth year."</p>
   <p>"There couldn't be anything useful that long ago. It's obvious he was afraid of his father and hated him, too. Typical stuff, basic psych. The father symbolizes judgment to him. I'm very much afraid Sam Clay is going to get off scot-free."</p>
   <p>"But if you think there's something haywire –"</p>
   <p>"The burden of proof is up to us," the sociologist said.</p>
   <p>The visor sang. A voice spoke softly.</p>
   <p>"No, I haven't got the answer yet. Now? All right. I'll drop over."</p>
   <p>He stood up.</p>
   <p>"The D.A. wants a consultation. I'm not hopeful, though. I'm afraid the State's going to lose this case. That's the trouble with the externalized conscience –"</p>
   <p>He didn't amplify. He went out, shaking his head, leaving the engineer staring speculatively at the screen. But within five minutes he was assigned to another job – the bureau was understaffed – and he didn't have a chance to investigate on his own until a week later. Then it didn't matter anymore.</p>
   <p>For, a week later, Sam Clay was walking out of the court an acquitted man. Bea Vanderman was waiting for him at the foot of the ramp. She wore black, but obviously her heart wasn't in it.</p>
   <p>"Sam," she said.</p>
   <p>He looked at her.</p>
   <p>He felt a little dazed. It was all over. Everything had worked out exactly according to plan. And nobody was watching him now. The Eye had closed. The invisible audience had put on its hats and coats and left the theater of Sam Clay's private life. From now on he could do and say precisely what he liked, with no censoring watcher's omnipresence to check him. He could act on impulse again.</p>
   <p>He had outwitted society. He had outwitted the Eye and all its minions in all their technological glory. He, Sam Clay, private citizen. It was a wonderful thing, and he could not understand why it left him feeling so flat.</p>
   <p>That had been a nonsensical moment, just before the murder. The moment of relenting. They say you get the same instant's frantic rejection on the verge of a good many important decisions – just before you marry, for instance. Or – what was it? Some other common instance he'd often heard of. For a second it eluded him. Then he had it. The hour before marriage – and the instant after suicide. After you've pulled the trigger, or jumped off the bridge. The instant of wild revulsion when you'd give anything to undo the irrevocable. Only, you can't. It's too late. The thing is done.</p>
   <p>Well, he'd been a fool. Luckily, it <emphasis>had</emphasis> been too late. His body took over and forced him to success he'd trained it for. About the job – it didn't matter. He'd get another. He'd proved himself capable. If he could outwit the Eye itself, what job existed he couldn't lick if he tried? Except – nobody knew exactly how good he was. How could he prove his capabilities? It was infuriating to achieve such phenomenal success after a lifetime of failures, and never to get the credit for it. How many men must have tried and failed where he had tried and succeeded? Rich men, successful men, brilliant men who had yet failed in the final test of all – the contest with the Eye, their own lives at stake. Only Sam Clay had passed that most important test in the world – and he could never claim credit for it.</p>
   <p>"... knew they wouldn't convict," Bea’s complacent voice was saying.</p>
   <p>Clay blinked at her. "What?"</p>
   <p>"I said I'm so glad you're free, darling. I knew they wouldn't convict you. I knew that from the very beginning." She smiled at him, and for the first time it occurred to him that Bea looked a little like a bulldog. It was something about her lower jaw. He thought that when her teeth were closed together the lower set probably rested just outside the upper. He had an instant's impulse to ask her about it. Then he decided he had better not.</p>
   <p>"You knew, did you?" he said.</p>
   <p>She squeezed his arm. What an ugly lower jaw that was. How odd he'd never noticed it before. And behind the heavy lashes, how small her eyes were. How mean.</p>
   <p>"Let's go where we can be alone," Bea said, clinging to him. "There's such a lot to talk about."</p>
   <p>"We <emphasis>are</emphasis> alone," Clay said, diverted for an instant to his original thoughts. "Nobody's watching," He glanced up at the sky and down at the mosaic pavement. He drew a long breath and let it out slowly. "Nobody," he said.</p>
   <p>"My speeder's parked right over here. We can –"</p>
   <p>"Sorry, Bea."</p>
   <p>"What do you mean?"</p>
   <p>"I've got business to attend to."</p>
   <p>"Forget business. Don't you understand that we're free now, both of us?"</p>
   <p>He had a horrible feeling he knew what she meant.</p>
   <p>"Wait a minute," he said, because this seemed the quickest way to end it. "I killed your husband, Bea. Don’t forget that."</p>
   <p>"You were acquitted. It was self-defense. The court said so."</p>
   <p>"It –" He paused, glanced up quickly at the high wall of the Justice Building, and began a one-sided, mirthless smile. It was all right; there was no Eye now. There never would be, again. He was unwatched.</p>
   <p>"You mustn't feel guilty, even within yourself," Bea said firmly. "It wasn't your fault. It simply wasn't. You've got to remember that. You <emphasis>couldn't</emphasis> have killed Andrew except by accident, Sam, so –"</p>
   <p>"What? What do you mean by that?"</p>
   <p>"Well, after all. I know the prosecution kept trying to prove you'd planned to kill Andrew all along, but you mustn't let what they said put any ideas in your head. I know you, Sam. I knew Andrew. You couldn't have planned a thing like that, and even if you had, it wouldn't have worked."</p>
   <p>The half-smile died.</p>
   <p>"It wouldn't?"</p>
   <p>She looked at him steadily.</p>
   <p>"Why, you couldn't have managed it," she said. "Andrew was the better man, and we both know it. He'd have been too clever to fall for anything –"</p>
   <p>"Anything a second rater like me could dream up?" Clay swallowed.  His lips tightened. "Even you. What's the idea? What's your angle now – that we second-raters ought to get together?"</p>
   <p>"Come on," she said, and slipped her arm through his. Clay hung back for a second. Then he scowled, looked back at the Justice Building, and followed Bea toward her speeder.</p>
   <p>The engineer had a free period. He was finally able to investi­gate Sam Clay's early childhood. It was purely academic now, but he liked to indulge his curiosity. He traced Clay back to the dark closet, when the boy was four, and used ultraviolet. Sam was huddled in a corner, crying silently, staring up with fright­ened eyes at a top shelf.</p>
   <p>What was on that shelf the engineer could not see.</p>
   <p>He kept the beam focused on the closet and cast back rapidly through time. The closet often opened and closed, and some­times Sam Clay was locked in it as punishment, but the upper shelf held its mystery until –</p>
   <p>It was in reverse. A woman reached to that shelf, took down an object, walked backward out of the closet to Sam Clay's bedroom, and went to the wall by the door. This was unusual, for generally it was Sam's father who was warden of the closet.</p>
   <p>She hung up a framed picture of a single huge staring eye floating in space. There was a legend under it. The letters spelled out: THOU GOD SEEST ME.</p>
   <p>The engineer kept on tracing. After a while it was night. The child was in bed, sitting up wide-eyed, afraid. A man's footsteps sounded on the stair. The scanner told all secrets but those of the inner mind. The man was Sam's father, coming up to punish him for some childish crime committed earlier. Moonlight fell upon the wall beyond which the footsteps approached showing how the wall quivered a little to the vibrations of the feet, and the Eye in its frame quivered, too. The boy seemed to brace himself. A defiant half-smile showed on his mouth, crooked, unsteady.</p>
   <p>This time he'd keep that smile, no matter what happened. When it was over he'd still have it, so his father could see it, and the Eye could see it and they'd know he hadn't given in. He hadn't … he –</p>
   <p>The door opened.</p>
   <p>He couldn't help it. The smile faded and was gone.</p>
   <p>"Well, what was eating him?" the engineer demanded.</p>
   <p>The sociologist shrugged. "You could say he never did really grow up. It's axiomatic that boys go through a phase of rivalry with their fathers. Usually that's sublimated; the child grows up and wins, in one way or another. But Sam Clay didn't. I suspect he developed an externalized conscience very early. Symbolizing partly his father, partly God, an Eye and society – which fulfills the role of protective, punishing parent, you know."</p>
   <p>"It still isn't evidence."</p>
   <p>"We aren't going to get any evidence on Sam Clay. But that doesn't mean he's got away with anything, you know. He's always been afraid to assume the responsibilities of maturity. He never took on an optimum challenge. He was afraid to succeed at anything because that symbolic Eye of his might smack him down. When he was a kid, he might have solved his entire problem by kicking his old man in the shins. Sure, he'd have got a harder whaling, but he'd have made some move to assert his individuality. As it is, he waited too long. And then he defied the wrong thing, and it wasn't really defiance, basically. Too late now. His formative years are past. The thing that might really solve Clay's problem would be his conviction for murder – but he's been acquitted. If he'd been convicted, then he could prove to the world that he'd hit back. He'd kicked his father in the shins, kept that defiant smile on his face, killed Andrew Vanderman. I think that's what he actually has wanted all along – recognition. Proof of his own ability to assert himself. He had to work hard to cover his tracks – if he made any – but that was part of the game. By winning it he's lost. The normal ways of escape are closed to him. He always had an Eye looking down at him."</p>
   <p>"Then the acquittal stands?"</p>
   <p>"There's still no evidence. The State's lost its case. But I … I don't think Sam Clay has won his. Something will happen." He sighed. "It's inevitable, I'm afraid. Sentence first, you see. Verdict afterward. The sentence was passed on Clay a long time ago."</p>
   <p>Sitting across from him in the Paradise Bar, behind a silver decanter of brandy in the center of the table, Bea looked lovely and hateful. It was the lights that made her lovely. They even managed to cast their shadows over that bulldog chin, and under her thick lashes the small, mean eyes acquired an illusion of beauty. But she still looked hateful. The lights could do nothing about that. They couldn't cast shadows into Sam Clay's private mind or distort the images there.</p>
   <p>He thought of Josephine. He hadn't made up his mind fully yet about that. But if he didn't quite know what he wanted, there was no shadow of doubt about what he <emphasis>didn't</emphasis> want no possible doubt whatever.</p>
   <p>"You need me, Sam," Bea told him over her brimming glass.</p>
   <p>"I can stand on my own feet. I don't need anybody."</p>
   <p>It was the indulgent way she looked at him. It was the smile that showed her teeth. He could see as clearly as if he had X-ray vision how the upper teeth would close down inside the lower when she shut her mouth. There would be a lot of strength in a jaw like that. He looked at her neck and saw the thickness of it, and thought how firmly she was getting her grip upon him, how she maneuvered for position and waited to lock her bulldog clamp deep into the fabric of his life again.</p>
   <p>"I'm going to marry Josephine, you know," he said.</p>
   <p>"No, you're not. You aren't the man for Josephine. I know that girl, Sam. For a while you may have had her convinced you were a go-getter. But she's bound to find out the truth. You'd be miserable together. You need me, Sam darling. You don't know what you want. Look at the mess you got into when you tried to act on your own. Oh, Sam, why don't you stop pretending? You know you never were a planner. You … what's the matter, Sam?"</p>
   <p>His sudden burst of laughter had startled both of them. He tried to answer her, but the laughter wouldn't let him. He lay back in his chair and shook with it until he almost strangled. He had come so close, so desperately close to bursting out with a boast that would have been confession. Just to convince the woman. Just to shut her up. He must care more about her good opinion than he had realized until now. But that last absurdity was too much. It was only ridiculous now. Sam Clay, not a planner.</p>
   <p>How good it was to let himself laugh, now. To let himself go, without having to think ahead. Acting on impulse again, after those long months of rigid repression. No audience from the future was clustering around this table, analyzing the quality of his laughter, observing that it verged on hysteria. Who cared? He deserved a little blow-off like this, after all he'd been through. He'd risked so much, and achieved so much – and in the end gained nothing, not even glory except in his own mind. He'd gained nothing, really, except the freedom to be hysterical if he felt like it. He laughed and laughed and laughed, hearing the shrill note of lost control in his own voice and not caring.</p>
   <p>People were turning to stare. The bartender looked over at him uneasily, getting ready to move if this went on. Bea stood up, leaned across the table, shook him by the shoulder.</p>
   <p>"Sam, what's the matter? Sam, do get hold of yourself! You're making a spectacle of me, Sam! What <emphasis>are</emphasis> you laughing at?"</p>
   <p>With a tremendous effort he forced the laughter back in his throat. His breath still came heavily and little bursts of merri­ment kept bubbling up so that he could hardly speak, but he got the words out somehow. They were probably the first words he had spoken without rigid censorship since he first put his plan into operation. And the words were these.</p>
   <p>"I'm laughing at the way I fooled you. I fooled everybody! You think I didn't know what I was doing every minute of the time? You think I wasn't planning, every step of the way? It took me eighteen months to do it, but I killed Andrew Vanderman with malice aforethought, and nobody can ever prove I did it." He giggled foolishly. "I just wanted you to know," he added in a mild voice.</p>
   <p>And it wasn't until he got his breath back and began to experience that feeling of incredible, delightful, incomparable relief that he knew what he had done.</p>
   <p>She was looking at him without a flicker of expression on her face. Total blank was all that showed. There was a dead silence for a quarter of a minute. Clay had the feeling that his words must have rung from the roof, that in a moment the police would come in to hale him away. But the words had been quietly spoken. No one had heard but Bea.</p>
   <p>And now, at last, Bea moved. She answered him, but not in words. The bulldog face convulsed suddenly and overflowed with laughter.</p>
   <p>As he listened, Clay felt all that flood of glorious relief ebbing away. For he saw that she did not believe him. And there was no way he could prove the truth.</p>
   <p>"Oh, you silly little man," Bea gasped when words came back to her. "You had me almost convinced for a minute. I almost believed you. I –" Laughter silenced her again, con­sciously silvery laughter that made heads turn. That conscious note in it warned him that she was up to something. Bea had had an idea. His own thoughts outran hers and he knew in an instant before she spoke exactly what the idea was and how she would apply it. He said: "I <emphasis>am</emphasis> going to marry Josephine," in the very instant that Bea spoke,</p>
   <p>"You're going to marry me," she said flatly. "You've got to. You don't know your own mind, Sam. I know what's best for you and I'll see you do it. Do you understand me, Sam?"</p>
   <p>"The police won't realize that was only a silly boast," she told him. "They'll believe you. You wouldn't want me to tell them what you just said, would you, Sam?"</p>
   <p>He looked at her in silence, seeing no way out. This dilemma had sharper horns than anything he could have imagined. For Bea did not and would not believe him, no matter how he yearned to convince her, while the police undoubtedly would believe him, to the undoing of his whole investment in time, effort, and murder. He had said it. It was engraved upon the walls and in the echoing air, waiting for that invisible audience in the future to observe. No one was listening now, but a word from Bea could make them reopen the case.</p>
   <p>A word from Bea.</p>
   <p>He looked at her, still in silence, but with a certain cool calculation beginning to dawn in the back of his mind.</p>
   <p>For a moment Sam Clay felt very tired indeed. In that moment he encompassed a good deal of tentative future time. In his mind he said yes to Bea, married her, lived an indefinite period as her husband. And he saw what that life would be like. He saw the mean small eyes watching him, the relentlessly gripping jaw set, the tyranny that would emerge slowly or not slowly, depending on the degree of his subservience, until he was utterly at the mercy of the woman who had been Andrew Vanderman's widow.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Sooner or later</emphasis>, he thought clearly to himself, <emphasis>I'd kill her</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>He'd have to kill. That sort of life, with that sort of woman, wasn't a life Sam Clay could live, indefinitely. And he'd proved his ability to kill and go free.</p>
   <p>But what about Andrew Vanderman's death?</p>
   <p>Because they'd have another case against him then. This time it had been qualitative; the next time, the balance would shift toward quantitative. If Sam Clay's wife died, Sam Clay would be investigated no matter how she died. Once a suspect, always a suspect in the eyes of the law. The Eye of the law. They'd check back. They'd return to this moment, while he sat here revolving thoughts of death in his mind. And they'd return to five minutes ago, and listen to him boast that he had killed Vanderman.</p>
   <p>A good lawyer might get him off. He could claim it wasn't the truth. He could say he had been goaded to an idle boast by the things Bea said. He might get away with that, and he might not. Scop would be the only proof, and he couldn't be compelled to take scop.</p>
   <p>But – no. That wasn't the answer. That wasn't the way out. He could tell by the sick, sinking feeling inside him. There had been just one glorious moment of release, after he'd made his confession to Bea, and from then on everything seemed to run downhill again.</p>
   <p>But that moment had been the goal he'd worked toward all this time. He didn't know what it was, or why he wanted it. But he recognized the feeling when it came. He wanted it back.</p>
   <p>This helpless feeling, this impotence – was this the total sum of what he had achieved? Then he'd failed, after all. Somehow, in some strange way he could only partly understand, he had failed; killing Vanderman hadn't been the answer at all. He wasn't a success. He was a second-rater, a passive, helpless worm whom Bea would manage and control and drive, eventually, to –</p>
   <p>"What's the matter, Sam?" Bea asked solicitously.</p>
   <p>"You think I'm a second-rater, don't you?" he said. "You'll never believe I'm not. You think I couldn't have killed Vanderman except by accident. You'll never believe I could possibly have defied –"</p>
   <p>"What?" she asked, when he did not go on.</p>
   <p>There was a new note of surprise in his voice.</p>
   <p>"But it wasn't defiance," he said slowly. "I just hid and dodged. Circumvented. I hung dark glasses on an Eye, because I was afraid of it. But – that wasn't defiance. So – what I really was trying to prove –"</p>
   <p>She gave him a startled, incredulous stare as he stood up.</p>
   <p>"Sam! What are you doing?" Her voice cracked a little.</p>
   <p>"Proving something," Clay said, smiling crookedly, and glanc­ing up from Bea to the ceiling. "Take a good look," he said to the Eye as he smashed her skull with the decanter.</p>

    <p>THE TWONKY</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The turnover at Mideastern Radio was so great that Mickey Lloyd couldn't keep track of his men. Employees kept quitting and going elsewhere, at a higher salary. So when the big-headed little man in overalls wandered vaguely out of a storeroom, Lloyd took one look at the brown dungaree suit – company provided – and said mildly, "The whistle blew half an hour ago. Hop to work."</p>
   <p>"Work-k-k?" The man seemed to have trouble with the word.</p>
   <p>Drunk? Lloyd, in his capacity as foreman, couldn't permit that. He flipped away his cigarette, walked forward and sniffed. No, it wasn't liquor. He peered at the badge on the man's overalls.</p>
   <p>"Two-o-four, m-mm. Are you new here?"</p>
   <p>"New. Huh?" The man rubbed a rising bump on his forehead. He was an odd-looking little chap, bald as a vacuum tube, with a pinched, pallid face and tiny eyes that held dazed wonder.</p>
   <p>"Come on, Joe. Wake up!" Lloyd was beginning to sound impatient. "You work here, don't you?"</p>
   <p>"Joe," said the man thoughtfully. "Work. Yes, I work. I make them." His words ran together oddly, as though he had a cleft palate.</p>
   <p>With another glance at the badge, Lloyd gripped Joe's arm and ran him through the assembly room. "Here's your place. Hop to it. Know what to do?"</p>
   <p>The other drew his scrawny body erect. "I am – expert," he remarked. "Make them better than Ponthwank."</p>
   <p>"O.K.," Lloyd said. "Make 'em, then." And he went away.</p>
   <p>The man called Joe hesitated, nursing the bruise on his head. The overalls caught his attention, and he examined them wonderingly. Where – oh, yes. They had been hanging in the room from which he had first emerged. His own garments had, naturally, dissipated during the trip – what trip?</p>
   <p>Amnesia, he thought. He had fallen from the ... the something when it slowed down and stopped. How odd this huge, machine-filled barn looked! It struck no chord of remembrance.</p>
   <p>Amnesia, that was it. He was a worker. He made things. As for the unfamiliarity of his surroundings, that meant nothing. He was still dazed. The clouds would lift from his mind presently. They were beginning to do that already.</p>
   <p>Work. Joe scuttled around the room, trying to goad his faulty memory. Men in overalls were doing things. Simple, obvious things. But how childish – how elemental! Perhaps this was a kindergarten.</p>
   <p>After a while Joe went out into a stock room and examined some finished models of combination radio-phonographs. So that was it. Awkward and clumsy, but it wasn't his place to say so. No. His job was to make Twonkies.</p>
   <p>Twonkies? The name jolted his memory again. Of course he knew how to make Twonkies. He'd made them all his life – had been specially trained for the job. Now they were using a different model of Twonky, but what the hell! Child's play for a clever workman.</p>
   <p>Joe went back into the shop and found a vacant bench. He began to build a Twonky. Occasionally he slipped off and stole the material he needed. Once, when he couldn't locate any tungsten, he hastily built a small gadget and made it.</p>
   <p>His bench was in a distant corner, badly lighted, though it seemed quite bright to Joe's eyes. Nobody noticed the console that was swiftly growing to completion there. Joe worked very, very fast. He ignored the noon whistle, and, at quitting time, his task was finished. It could, perhaps, stand another coat of paint; it lacked the Shimmertone of a standard Twonky. But none of the others had Shimmertone. Joe sighed, crawled under the bench, looked in vain for a relaxopad, and went to sleep on the floor.</p>
   <p>A few hours later he woke up. The factory was empty. Odd! Maybe the working hours had changed. Maybe – Joe's mind felt funny. Sleep had cleared away the mists of amnesia, if such it had been, but he still felt dazed.</p>
   <p>Muttering under his breath, he sent the Twonky into the stock room and compared it with the others. Superficially it was identical with a console radio-phonograph combination of the latest model. Following the pattern of the others, Joe had camouflaged and disguised the various organs and reactors.</p>
   <p>He went back into the shop. Then the last of the mists cleared from his mind. Joe's shoulders jerked convulsively.</p>
   <p>"Great Snell!" he gasped. "So that was it! I ran into a temporal snag!" With a startled glance around, he fled to the storeroom from which he had first emerged. The overalls he took off and returned to their hook. After that, Joe went over to a corner, felt around in the air, nodded with satisfaction and seated himself on nothing, three feet above the floor. Then Joe vanished.</p>
   <p>"Time," said Kerry Westerfield, "is curved. Eventually it gets back to the same place where it started. That's duplication." He put his feet up on a conveniently outjutting rock of the chimney and stretched luxuriously. From the kitchen Martha made clinking noises with bottles and glasses.</p>
   <p>"Yesterday at this time I had a Martini," Kerry said. "The time curve indicates that I should have another one now. Are you listening, angel?"</p>
   <p>"I'm pouring," said the angel distantly.</p>
   <p>"You get my point, then. Here's another. Time describes a spiral instead of a circle. If you call the first cycle 'a', the second one's 'a plus 1' – see? Which means a double Martini tonight."</p>
   <p>"I knew where that would end," Martha remarked, coming into the spacious, oak-raftered living room. She was a small, dark-haired woman, with a singularly pretty face and a figure to match. Her tiny gingham apron looked slightly absurd in combination with slacks and silk blouse. "And they don't make infinity-proof gin. Here's your Martini." She did things with the shaker and manipulated glasses.</p>
   <p>"Stir slowly," Kerry cautioned. "Never shake. Ah – that's it." He accepted the drink and eyed it appreciatively. Black hair, sprinkled with gray, gleamed in the lamplight as he sipped the Martini. "Good. Very good."</p>
   <p>Martha drank slowly and eyed her husband. A nice guy, Kerry Westerfield. He was forty-odd, pleasantly ugly, with a wide mouth and with an occasional sardonic gleam in his gray eyes as he contemplated life. They had been married for twelve years, and liked it.</p>
   <p>From outside, the late, faint glow of sunset came through the windows, picking out the console cabinet that stood against the wall by the door. Kerry peered at it with appreciation.</p>
   <p>"A pretty penny," he remarked. "Still –"</p>
   <p>"What? Oh. The men had a tough time getting it up the stairs. Why don't you try it, Kerry?"</p>
   <p>"Didn't you?"</p>
   <p>"The old one was complicated enough," Martha said in a baffled manner. "Gadgets. They confuse me. I was brought up on an Edison. You wound it up with a crank, and strange noises came out of a horn. That I could understand. But now – you push a button, and extraordinary things happen. Electric eyes, tone selections, records that get played on both sides, to the accompaniment of weird groanings and clickings from inside the console – probably you understand those things. I don't even want to. Whenever I play a Crosby record in a superduper like that, Bing seems embarrassed."</p>
   <p>Kerry ate his olive. "I'm going to play some Debussy." He nodded toward a table. "There's a new Crosby record for you. The latest."</p>
   <p>Martha wriggled happily. "Can I, maybe, huh?"</p>
   <p>"Uh-huh."</p>
   <p>"But you'll have to show me how."</p>
   <p>"Simple enough," said Kerry, beaming at the console. "Those babies are pretty good, you know. They do everything but think."</p>
   <p>"I wish they'd wash the dishes," Martha remarked. She set down her glass, got up and vanished into the kitchen.</p>
   <p>Kerry snapped on a lamp nearby and went over to examine the new radio, Mideastern's latest model, with all the new improvements. It had been expensive – but what the hell? He could afford it. And the old one had been pretty well shot.</p>
   <p>It was not, he saw, plugged in. Nor were there any wires in evidence – not even a ground. Something new, perhaps. Built-in antenna and ground. Kerry crouched down, looked for a socket, and plugged the cord into it.</p>
   <p>That done, he opened the doors and eyed the dials with every appearance of satisfaction. A beam of bluish light shot out and hit him in the eyes. From the depths of the console a faint, thoughtful clicking proceeded. Abruptly it stopped. Kerry blinked, fiddled with dials and switches, and bit at a fingernail.</p>
   <p>The radio said, in a distant voice, "Psychology pattern checked and recorded."</p>
   <p>"Eh?" Kerry twirled a dial. "Wonder what that was? Amateur station – no, they're off the air. Hm-m-m." He shrugged and went over to a chair beside the shelves of albums. His gaze ran swiftly over the titles and composers' names. Where was the <emphasis>Swan of Tuonela</emphasis>? There it was, next to <emphasis>Finlandia</emphasis>. Kerry took down the album and opened it in his lap. With his free hand he extracted a cigarette from his pocket, put it between his lips and fumbled for the matches on the table beside him. The first match he lit went out.</p>
   <p>He tossed it into the fireplace and was about to reach for another when a faint noise caught his attention. The radio was walking across the room toward him. A whiplike tendril flicked out from somewhere, picked up a match, scratched it beneath the table top – as Kerry had done – and held the flame to the man's cigarette.</p>
   <p>Automatic reflexes took over. Kerry sucked in his breath, and exploded in smoky, racking coughs. He bent double, gasping and momentarily blind.</p>
   <p>When he could see again, the radio was back in its accustomed place.</p>
   <p>Kerry caught his lower lip between his teeth. "Martha," he called.</p>
   <p>"Soup's on," her voice said.</p>
   <p>Kerry didn't answer. He stood up, went over to the radio and looked at it hesitantly. The electric cord had been pulled out of its socket. Kerry gingerly replaced it.</p>
   <p>He crouched to examine the console's legs. They looked like finely finished wood. His exploratory hand told him nothing. Wood – hard and brittle.</p>
   <p>How in hell –</p>
   <p>"Dinner!" Martha called.</p>
   <p>Kerry threw his cigarette into the fireplace and slowly walked out of the room. His wife, setting a gravy boat in place, stared at him.</p>
   <p>"How many Martinis did you have?"</p>
   <p>"Just one," Kerry said in a vague way. "I must have dozed off for a minute. Yeah. I must have."</p>
   <p>"Well, fall to," Martha commanded. "This is the last chance you'll have to make a pig of yourself on my dumplings, for a week, anyway."</p>
   <p>Kerry absently felt for his wallet, took out an envelope and tossed it at his wife. "Here's your ticket, angel. Don't lose it."</p>
   <p>"Oh? I rate a compartment!" Martha thrust the pasteboard back into its envelope and gurgled happily. "You're a pal. Sure you can get along without me?"</p>
   <p>"Huh? Hm-m-m – I think so." Kerry salted his avocado. He shook himself and seemed to come out of a slight daze. "Sure, I'll be all right. You trot off to Denver and help Carol have her baby. It's all in the family."</p>
   <p>"We-ell, my only sister –" Martha grinned. "You know how she and Bill are. Quite nuts. They'll need a steadying hand just now."</p>
   <p>There was no reply. Kerry was brooding over a forkful of avocado. He muttered something about the Venerable Bede.</p>
   <p>"What about him?"</p>
   <p>"Lecture tomorrow. Every term we bog down on the Bede, for some strange reason. Ah, well."</p>
   <p>"Got your lecture ready?"</p>
   <p>Kerry nodded. "Sure." For eight years he had taught at the University, and he certainly should know the schedule by this time!</p>
   <p>Later, over coffee and cigarettes, Martha glanced at her wrist watch. "Nearly train time. I'd better finish packing. The dishes –"</p>
   <p>"I'll do 'em." Kerry wandered after his wife into the bedroom and made motions of futile helpfulness. After a while, he carried the bags down to the car. Martha joined him, and they headed for the depot.</p>
   <p>The train was on time. Half an hour after it had pulled out, Kerry drove the car back into the garage, let himself into the house and yawned mightily. He was tired. Well, the dishes, and then beer and a book in bed.</p>
   <p>With a puzzled look at the radio, he entered the kitchen and started on the dishes. The hall phone rang. Kerry wiped his hands on a dish towel and answered it.</p>
   <p>It was Mike Fitzgerald, who taught psychology at the University.</p>
   <p>"Hiya, Fitz."</p>
   <p>"Hiya. Martha gone?"</p>
   <p>"Yeah. I just drove her to the train."</p>
   <p>"Feel like talking, then? I've got some pretty good Scotch. Why not run over and gab a while?"</p>
   <p>"Like to," Kerry said, yawning again, "but I'm dead. Tomorrow's a big day. Rain check?"</p>
   <p>"Sure. I just finished correcting papers, and felt the need of sharpening my mind. What's the matter?"</p>
   <p>"Nothing. Wait a minute." Kerry put down the phone and looked over his shoulder, scowling. Noises were coming from the kitchen. What the hell!</p>
   <p>He went along the hall and stopped in the doorway, motionless and staring. The radio was washing the dishes.</p>
   <p>After a while he returned to the phone. Fitzgerald said, "Something?"</p>
   <p>"My new radio," Kerry told him carefully. "It's washing the dishes." Fitz didn't answer for a moment. His laugh was a bit hesitant. "Oh?"</p>
   <p>"I'll call you back," Kerry said, and hung up. He stood motionless for a while, chewing his lip. Then he walked back to the kitchen and paused to watch.</p>
   <p>The radio's back was toward him. Several limber tentacles were manipulating the dishes, expertly sousing them in hot, soapy water, scrubbing them with the little mop, dipping them into the rinse water and then stacking them neatly in the metal rack. Those whip-lashes were the only sign of unusual activity. The legs were apparently solid.</p>
   <p>"Hey!" Kerry said.</p>
   <p>There was no response.</p>
   <p>He sidled around till he could examine the radio more closely. The tentacles emerged from a slot under one of the dials. The electric cord was dangling. No juice, then. But what –</p>
   <p>Kerry stepped back and fumbled out a cigarette. Instantly the radio turned, took a match from its container on the stove and walked forward. Kerry blinked, studying the legs. They couldn't be wood. They were bending as the – the thing moved, elastic as rubber. The radio had a peculiar sidling motion unlike anything else on earth.</p>
   <p>It lit Kerry's cigarette and went back to the sink, where it resumed the dishwashing.</p>
   <p>Kerry phoned Fitzgerald again. "I wasn't kidding. I'm having hallucinations or something. That damned radio just lit a cigarette for me."</p>
   <p>"Wait a minute." Fitzgerald's voice sounded undecided. "This is a gag, eh?"</p>
   <p>"No. And I don't think it's a hallucination, either. It's up your alley. Can you run over and test my knee-jerks?"</p>
   <p>"All right," Fitz said. "Give me ten minutes. Have a drink ready."</p>
   <p>He hung up, and Kerry, laying the phone back into its cradle, turned to see the radio walking out of the kitchen toward the living room. Its square, boxlike contour was subtly horrifying, like some bizarre sort of hobgoblin. Kerry shivered.</p>
   <p>He followed the radio, to find it in its former place, motionless and impassive. He opened the doors, examining the turntable, the phonograph arm and the other buttons and gadgets. There was nothing apparently unusual. Again he touched the legs. They were not wood, after all. Some plastic, which seemed quite hard. Or – maybe they were wood, after all. It was difficult to make certain, without damaging the finish. Kerry felt a natural reluctance to use a knife on his new console.</p>
   <p>He tried the radio, getting local stations without trouble. The tone was good –unusually good, he thought. The phonograph –</p>
   <p>He picked up Halvorsen's <emphasis>Entrance of the Boyars</emphasis> at random and slipped it into place, closing the lid. No sound emerged. Investigation proved that the needle was moving rhythmically along the groove, but without audible result. Well?</p>
   <p>Kerry removed the record as the doorbell rang. It was Fitzgerald, a gangling, saturnine man with a leathery, wrinkled face and a tousled mop of dull gray hair. He extended a large, bony hand.</p>
   <p>"Where's my drink?"</p>
   <p>"Lo, Fitz. Come in the kitchen. I'll mix. Highball?"</p>
   <p>"Highball."</p>
   <p>"O.K." Kerry led the way. "Don't drink it just yet, though. I want to show you my new combination."</p>
   <p>"The one that washes dishes?" Fitzgerald asked. "What else does it do?"</p>
   <p>Kerry gave the other a glass. "It won't play records."</p>
   <p>"Oh, well. A minor matter, if it'll do the housework. Let's take a look at it." Fitzgerald went into the living room, selected <emphasis>Afternoon of a Faun</emphasis> and approached the radio. "It isn't plugged in."</p>
   <p>"That doesn't matter a bit," Kerry said wildly.</p>
   <p>"Batteries?" Fitzgerald slipped the record in place and adjusted the switches. "Ten inch – there. Now we'll see." He beamed triumphantly at Kerry. "Well? It's playing now."</p>
   <p>It was.</p>
   <p>Kerry said, "Try that Halvorsen piece. Here." He handed the disk to Fitzgerald, who pushed the reject switch and watched the lever arm lift.</p>
   <p>But this time the phonograph refused to play. It didn't like <emphasis>Entrance of the Boyars</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>"That's funny," Fitzgerald grunted. 'Probably the trouble's with the record. Let's try another."</p>
   <p>There was no trouble with <emphasis>Daphnis and Chloë</emphasis>. But the radio silently rejected the composer's <emphasis>Bolero</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>Kerry sat down and pointed to a nearby chair. "That doesn't prove anything. Come over here and watch. Don't drink anything yet. You, uh, you feel perfectly normal?"</p>
   <p>"Sure. Well?"</p>
   <p>Kerry took out a cigarette. The console walked across the room, picking up a match book on the way and politely held the flame. Then it went back to its place against the wall.</p>
   <p>Fitzgerald didn't say anything. After a while he took a cigarette from his pocket and waited. Nothing happened.</p>
   <p>"So?" Kerry asked.</p>
   <p>"A robot. That's the only possible answer. Where in the name of Petrarch did you get it?"</p>
   <p>"You don't seem much surprised."</p>
   <p>"I am, though. But I've seen robots before; Westinghouse tried it, you know. Only this –" Fitzgerald tapped his teeth with a nail. "Who made it?"</p>
   <p>"How the devil should I know?" Kerry demanded. "The radio people, I suppose."</p>
   <p>Fitzgerald narrowed his eyes. "Wait a minute. I don't quite understand –"</p>
   <p>"There's nothing to understand. I bought this combination a few days ago. Turned in the old one. It was delivered this afternoon, and ..." Kerry explained what had happened.</p>
   <p>"You mean you didn't know it was a robot?"</p>
   <p>"Exactly. I bought it as a radio. And – and – the damn thing seems almost alive to me."</p>
   <p>"Nope." Fitzgerald shook his head, rose and inspected the console carefully. "It's a new kind of robot. At least –" He hesitated. "What else is there to think? I suggest you get in touch with the Mideastem people tomorrow and check up."</p>
   <p>"Let's open the cabinet and look inside," Kerry suggested.</p>
   <p>Fitzgerald was willing, but the experiment proved impossible. The presumably wooden panels weren't screwed into place, and there was no apparent way of opening the console. Kerry found a screwdriver and applied it, gingerly at first, then with a sort of repressed fury. He could neither pry free a panel or even scratch the dark, smooth finish of the cabinet.</p>
   <p>"Damn!" he said finally. "Well, your guess is as good as mine. It's a robot. Only I didn't know they could make 'em like this. And why in a radio?"</p>
   <p>"Don't ask me." Fitzgerald shrugged. "Check up tomorrow. That's the first step. Naturally, I'm pretty baffled. If a new sort of specialized robot has been invented, why put it in a console? And what makes those legs move? There aren't any casters."</p>
   <p>"I've been wondering about that, too."</p>
   <p>"When it moves, the legs look – rubbery. But they're not. They're hard as – as hardwood. Or plastic."</p>
   <p>"I'm afraid of the thing," Kerry said.</p>
   <p>"Want to stay at my place tonight?"</p>
   <p>"N-no. No. I guess not. The – robot can't hurt me."</p>
   <p>"I don't think it wants to. It's been helping you, hasn't it?"</p>
   <p>"Yeah," Kerry said, and went off to mix another drink.</p>
   <p>The rest of the conversation was inconclusive. Fitzgerald, several hours later, went home rather worried. He wasn't as casual as he had pretended, for the sake of Kerry's nerves. The impingement of something so entirely unexpected on normal life was subtly frightening. And yet, as he had said, the robot didn't seem menacing.</p>
   <p>Kerry went to bed, with a new detective mystery. The radio followed him into the bedroom and gently took the book out of his hand. Kerry instinctively snatched for it.</p>
   <p>"Hey!" he said. "What the devil –"</p>
   <p>The radio went back into the living room. Kerry followed, in time to see the book replaced on the shelf. After a bit Kerry retreated, locking his door, and slept uneasily till dawn.</p>
   <p>In dressing gown and slippers, he stumbled out to stare at the console. It was back in its former place, looking as though it had never moved. Kerry, rather white around the gills, made breakfast.</p>
   <p>He was allowed only one cup of coffee. The radio appeared, reprovingly took the second cup from his hand and emptied it into the sink.</p>
   <p>That was quite enough for Kerry Westerfield. He found his hat and topcoat and almost ran out of the house. He had a horrid feeling that the radio might follow him, but it didn't, luckily for his sanity. He was beginning to be worried.</p>
   <p>During the morning he found time to telephone Mideastern. The salesman knew nothing. It was a standard model combination, the latest. If it wasn't giving satisfaction, of course, he'd be glad to –</p>
   <p>"It's O.K.," Kerry said. "But who made the thing? That's what I want to find out."</p>
   <p>"One moment, sir." There was a delay. "It came from Mr. Lloyd's department. One of our foremen."</p>
   <p>"Let me speak to him, please."</p>
   <p>But Lloyd wasn't very helpful. After much thought, he remembered that the combination had been placed in the stock room without a serial number. It had been added later.</p>
   <p>"But who made it?"</p>
   <p>"I just don't know. I can find out for you, I guess. Suppose I ring you back."</p>
   <p>"Don't forget," Kerry said, and went back to his class. The lecture on the Venerable Bede wasn't too successful.</p>
   <p>At lunch he saw Fitzgerald, who seemed relieved when Kerry came over to his table. "Find out any more about your pet robot?" the psychology professor demanded.</p>
   <p>No one else was within hearing. With a sigh Kerry sat down and lit a cigarette. "Not a thing. It's a pleasure to be able to do this myself." He drew smoke into his lungs. "I phoned the company."</p>
   <p>"And?"</p>
   <p>"They don't know anything. Except that it didn't have a serial number."</p>
   <p>"That may be significant," Fitzgerald said.</p>
   <p>Kerry told the other about the incidents of the book and the coffee, and Fitzgerald squinted thoughtfully at his milk. "I've given you some psych tests. Too much stimulation isn't good for you."</p>
   <p>"A detective yarn!"</p>
   <p>"Carrying it a bit to extremes, I'll admit. But I can understand why the robot acted that way, though I dunno how it managed it." He hesitated. "Without intelligence, that is."</p>
   <p>"Intelligence?" Kerry licked his lips. "I'm not so sure that it's just a machine. And I'm not crazy."</p>
   <p>"No, you're not. But you say the robot was in the front room. How could it tell what you were reading?"</p>
   <p>"Short of X-ray vision and superfast scanning and assimilative powers, I can't imagine. Perhaps it doesn't want me to read anything."</p>
   <p>"You've said something," Fitzgerald grunted. "Know much about theoretical machines of that type?"</p>
   <p>"Robots?"</p>
   <p>"Purely theoretical. Your brain's a colloid, you know. Compact, complicated – but slow. Suppose you work out a gadget with a multimillion radioatomic unit embedded in an insulating material. The result is a brain, Kerry. A brain with a tremendous number of units interacting at light-velocity speeds. A radio tube adjusts current flow when it's operating at forty million separate signals a second. And, theoretically, a radioatomic brain of the type I've mentioned could include perception, recognition, consideration, reaction and adjustment in a hundred-thousandth of a second."</p>
   <p>"Theory."</p>
   <p>"I've thought so. But I'd like to find out where your radio came from."</p>
   <p>A page came over. "Telephone call for Mr. Westerfield."</p>
   <p>Kerry excused himself and left. When he returned, there was a puzzled frown knitting his dark brows. Fitzgerald looked at him inquiringly.</p>
   <p>"Guy named Lloyd, at the Mideastern plant. I was talking to him about the radio."</p>
   <p>"Any luck?"</p>
   <p>Kerry shook his head. "No. Well, not much. He didn't know who had built the thing."</p>
   <p>"But it was built in the plant?"</p>
   <p>"Yes. About two weeks ago – but there's no record of who worked on it. Lloyd seemed to think that was very, very funny. If a radio's built in the plant, they know who put it together."</p>
   <p>"So?"</p>
   <p>"So nothing. I asked him how to open the cabinet, and he said it was easy. Just unscrew the panel in back."</p>
   <p>"There aren't any screws," Fitzgerald said.</p>
   <p>"I know."</p>
   <p>They looked at one another.</p>
   <p>Fitzgerald said, "I'd give fifty bucks to find out whether that robot was really built only two weeks ago."</p>
   <p>"Why?"</p>
   <p>"Because a radioatomic brain would need training. Even in such matters as the lighting of a cigarette."</p>
   <p>"It saw me light one."</p>
   <p>"And followed the example. The dishwashing – hm-m-m. Induction, I suppose. If that gadget has been trained, it's a robot. If it hasn't –" Fitzgerald stopped.</p>
   <p>Kerry blinked. "Yes?"</p>
   <p>"I don't know what the devil it is. It bears the same relation to a robot that we bear to Eohippus. One thing I do know, Kerry; it's very probable that no scientist today has the knowledge it would take to make a – a thing like that."</p>
   <p>"You're arguing in circles," Kerry said. "It was made."</p>
   <p>"Uh-huh. But how – when – and by whom? That's what's got me worried."</p>
   <p>"Well, I've a class in five minutes. Why not come over tonight?"</p>
   <p>"Can't. I'm lecturing at the Hall. I'll phone you after, though." With a nod Kerry went out, trying to dismiss the matter from his mind. He succeeded pretty well. But dining alone in a restaurant that night, he began to feel a general unwillingness to go home. A hobgoblin was waiting for him.</p>
   <p>"Brandy," he told the waiter. "Make it double."</p>
   <p>Two hours later a taxi let Kerry out at his door. He was remarkably drunk. Things swam before his eyes. He walked unsteadily toward the porch, mounted the steps with exaggerated care and let himself into the house.</p>
   <p>He switched on a lamp.</p>
   <p>The radio came forward to meet him. Tentacles, thin but strong as metal, coiled gently around his body, holding him motionless. A pang of violent fear struck through Kerry. He struggled desperately and tried to yell, but his throat was dry.</p>
   <p>From the radio panel a beam of yellow light shot out, blinding the man. It swung down, aimed at his chest. Abruptly a queer taste was perceptible under Kerry's tongue.</p>
   <p>After a minute or so, the ray clicked out, the tentacles flashed back out of sight and the console returned to its corner. Kerry staggered weakly to a chair and relaxed, gulping.</p>
   <p>He was sober. Which was quite impossible. Fourteen brandies infiltrate a definite amount of alcohol into the system. One can't wave a magic wand and instantly reach a state of sobriety. Yet that was exactly what had happened.</p>
   <p>The – robot was trying to be helpful. Only Kerry would have preferred to remain drunk.</p>
   <p>He got up gingerly and sidled past the radio to the bookshelf. One eye on the combination, he took down the detective novel he had tried to read on the preceding night. As he had expected, the radio took it from his hand and replaced it on the shelf. Kerry, remembering Fitzgerald's words, glanced at his watch. Reaction time, four seconds.</p>
   <p>He took down a Chaucer and waited, but the radio didn't stir. However, when Kerry found a history volume, it was gently removed from his fingers. Reaction time, six seconds.</p>
   <p>Kerry located a history twice as thick.</p>
   <p>Reaction time, ten seconds.</p>
   <p>Uh-huh. So the robot did read the books. That meant X-ray vision and superswift reactions. Jumping Jehoshaphat!</p>
   <p>Kerry tested more books, wondering what the criterion was. <emphasis>Alice in Wonderland</emphasis> was snatched from his hand; Millay's poems were not. He made a list, with two columns, for future reference.</p>
   <p>The robot, then, was not merely a servant. It was a censor. But what was the standard of comparison?</p>
   <p>After a while he remembered his lecture tomorrow, and thumbed through his notes. Several points needed verification. Rather hesitantly he located the necessary reference book – and the robot took it away from him.</p>
   <p>"Wait a minute," Kerry said. "I need that." He tried to pull the volume out of the tentacle's grasp, without success. The console paid no attention. It calmly replaced the book on the shelf.</p>
   <p>Kerry stood biting his lip. This was a bit too much. The damned robot was a monitor. He sidled toward the book, snatched it and was out in the hall before the radio could move.</p>
   <p>The thing was coming after him. He could hear the soft padding of its – its feet. Kerry scurried into the bedroom and locked the door. He waited, heart thumping, as the knob was tried gently.</p>
   <p>A wire-thin chum crept through the crack of the door and fumbled with the key. Kerry suddenly jumped forward and shoved the auxiliary bolt into position. But that didn't help, either. The robot's precision tools – the specialized antennae – slid it back; and then the console opened the door, walked into the room and came toward Kerry.</p>
   <p>He felt a touch of panic. With a little gasp he threw the book at the thing, and it caught it deftly. Apparently that was all that was wanted, for the radio turned and went out, rocking awkwardly on its rubbery legs, carrying the forbidden volume. Kerry cursed quietly.</p>
   <p>The phone rang. It was Fitzgerald.</p>
   <p>"Well? How'd you make out?"</p>
   <p>"Have you got a copy of Cassen's <emphasis>Social Literature of the Ages</emphasis>?"</p>
   <p>"I don't think so, no. Why?"</p>
   <p>"I'll get it in the University library tomorrow, then." - Kerry explained what had happened. Fitzgerald whistled softly.</p>
   <p>"Interfering, is it? Hm-m-m. I wonder ..."</p>
   <p>"I'm afraid of the thing."</p>
   <p>"I don't think it means you any harm. You say it sobered you up?"</p>
   <p>"Yeah. With a light ray. That isn't very logical."</p>
   <p>"It might be. The vibrationary equivalent of thiamine chloride."</p>
   <p>"Light?"</p>
   <p>"There's vitamin content in sunlight, you know. That isn't the important point. It's censoring your reading – and apparently it reads the books, with superfast reactions. That gadget, whatever it is, isn't merely a robot."</p>
   <p>"You're telling me," Kerry said grimly. "It's a Hitler." Fitzgerald didn't laugh. Rather soberly, he suggested, "Suppose you spend the night at my place?"</p>
   <p>"No," Kerry said, his voice stubborn. "No so-and-so radio's going to chase me out of my house. I'll take an axe to the thing first."</p>
   <p>"We-ell, you know what you're doing, I suppose. Phone me if – if anything happens."</p>
   <p>"O.K.," Kerry said, and hung up. He went into the living room and eyed the radio coldly. What the devil was it – and what was it trying to do? Certainly it wasn't merely a robot. Equally certainly, it wasn't alive, in the sense that a colloid brain is alive.</p>
   <p>Lips thinned, he went over and fiddled with the dials and switches. A swing band's throbbing, erratic tempo came from the console. He tried the short-wave band – nothing unusual there. So?</p>
   <p>So nothing. There was no answer.</p>
   <p>After a while he went to bed.</p>
   <p>At luncheon the next day he brought Cassen's <emphasis>Social Literature</emphasis> to show Fitzgerald.</p>
   <p>"What about it?"</p>
   <p>"Look here." Kerry flipped the pages and indicated a passage. "Does this mean anything to you?"</p>
   <p>Fitzgerald read it. "Yeah. The point seems to be that individualism is necessary for the production of literature. Right?"</p>
   <p>Kerry looked at him. "I don't know."</p>
   <p>"Eh?"</p>
   <p>"My mind goes funny."</p>
   <p>Fitzgerald rumpled his gray hair, narrowing his eyes and watching the other man intently. "Come again. I don't quite –"</p>
   <p>With angry patience, Kerry said, "This morning I went into the library and looked up this reference. I read it all right. But it didn't mean anything to me. Just words. Know how it is when you're fagged out and have been reading a lot? You'll run into a sentence with a lot of subjunctive clauses, and it doesn't percolate. Well, it was like that."</p>
   <p>"Read it now," Fitzgerald said quietly, thrusting the book across the table.</p>
   <p>Kerry obeyed, looking up with a wry smile. "No good."</p>
   <p>"Read it aloud. I'll go over it with you, step by step."</p>
   <p>But that didn't help. Kerry seemed utterly unable to assimilate the sense of the passage.</p>
   <p>"Semantic block, maybe," Fitzgerald said, scratching his ear. "Is this the first time it's happened?"</p>
   <p>"Yes – no. I don't know."</p>
   <p>"Cot any classes this afternoon? Good. Let's run over to your place." Kerry thrust away his plate. "All right. I'm not hungry. Whenever you're ready –"</p>
   <p>Half an hour later they were looking at the radio. It seemed quite harmless. Fitzgerald wasted some time trying to pry a panel off, but finally gave it up as a bad job. He found pencil and paper, seated himself opposite Kerry and began to ask questions.</p>
   <p>At one point he paused. "You didn't mention that before."</p>
   <p>"Forgot it, I guess."</p>
   <p>Fitzgerald tapped his teeth with the pencil. "Hm-m-m. The first time the radio acted up –"</p>
   <p>"It hit me in the eye with a blue light."</p>
   <p>"Not that. I mean – what it said."</p>
   <p>Kerry blinked. "What it said?" He hesitated. "'Psychology pattern checked and noted,' or something like that. I thought I'd tuned in on some station and got part of a quiz program or something. You mean –"</p>
   <p>"Were the words easy to understand? Good English?"</p>
   <p>"No, now that I remember it," Kerry scowled. "They were slurred quite a lot. Vowels stressed."</p>
   <p>"Uh-huh. Well, let's get on." They tried a word-association test. Finally Fitzgerald leaned back, frowning. "I want to check this stuff with the last tests I gave you a few months ago. It looks funny to me – damned funny. I'd feel a lot better if I knew exactly what memory was. We've done considerable work on mnemonics – artificial memory. Still, it may not be that at all."</p>
   <p>"Eh?"</p>
   <p>"That – machine. Either it's got an artificial memory, has been highly trained or else it's adjusted to a different milieu and culture. It has affected you – quite a lot."</p>
   <p>Kerry licked dry lips. "How?"</p>
   <p>"Implanted blocks in your mind. I haven't correlated them yet. When I do, we may be able to figure out some sort of answer. No, that thing isn't a robot. It's a lot more than that."</p>
   <p>Kerry took out a cigarette; the console walked across the room and lit it for him. The two men watched with a faint shrinking horror.</p>
   <p>"You'd better stay with me tonight," Fitzgerald suggested.</p>
   <p>"No," Kerry said. He shivered.</p>
   <p>The next day Fitzgerald looked for Kerry at lunch, but the younger man did not appear. He telephoned the house, and Martha answered the call.</p>
   <p>"Hello! When did you get back?"</p>
   <p>"Hello, Fitz. About an hour ago. My sister went ahead and had her baby without me – so I came back." She stopped, and Fitzgerald was alarmed at her tone.</p>
   <p>"Where's Kerry?"</p>
   <p>"He's here. Can you come over, Fitz? I'm worried."</p>
   <p>"What's the matter with him?"</p>
   <p>"I – I don't know. Come right away."</p>
   <p>"O.K.," Fitzgerald said, and hung up, biting his lips. He was worried. When, a short while later, he rang the Westerfield bell, he discovered that his nerves were badly out of control. But sight of Martha reassured him.</p>
   <p>He followed her into the living room. Fitzgerald's glance went at once to the console, which was unchanged, and then to Kerry, seated motionless by a window. Kerry's face had a blank, dazed look. His pupils were dilated, and he seemed to recognize Fitzgerald only slowly.</p>
   <p>"Hello, Fitz," he said.</p>
   <p>"How do you feel?"</p>
   <p>Martha broke in. "Fitz, what's wrong? Is he sick? Shall I call the doctor?"</p>
   <p>Fitzgerald sat down. "Have you noticed anything funny about that radio?"</p>
   <p>"No. Why?"</p>
   <p>"Then listen." He told the whole story, watching incredulity struggle with reluctant belief on Martha's face. Presently she said, "I can't quite –"</p>
   <p>"If Kerry takes out a cigarette, the thing will light it for him. Want to see how it works?"</p>
   <p>"N-no. Yes. I suppose so." Martha's eyes were wide.</p>
   <p>Fitzgerald gave Kerry a cigarette. The expected happened.</p>
   <p>Martha didn't say a word. When the console had returned to its place, she shivered and went over to Kerry. He looked at her vaguely.</p>
   <p>"He needs a doctor, Fitz."</p>
   <p>"Yes." Fitzgerald didn't mention that a doctor might be quite useless.</p>
   <p>"What is that thing?"</p>
   <p>"It's more than a robot. And it's been readjusting Kerry. I told you what's happened. When I checked Kerry's psychology patterns, I found that they'd altered. He's lost most of his initiative."</p>
   <p>"Nobody on earth could have made that –"</p>
   <p>Fitzgerald scowled. "I thought of that. It seems to be the product of a well-developed culture, quite different from ours. Martian, perhaps. It's such a specialized thing that it naturally fits into a complicated culture. But I do not understand why it looks exactly like a Mideastern console radio."</p>
   <p>Martha touched Kerry's hand. "Camouflage?"</p>
   <p>"But why? You were one of my best pupils in psych, Martha. Look at this logically. Imagine a civilization where a gadget like that has its place. Use inductive reasoning."</p>
   <p>"I'm trying to. I can't think very well. Fitz, I'm worried about Kerry."</p>
   <p>"I'm all right," Kerry said.</p>
   <p>Fitzgerald put his finger tips together. "It isn't a radio so much as a monitor. In this other civilization, perhaps every man has one, or maybe only a few – the ones who need it. It keeps them in line."</p>
   <p>"By destroying initiative?"</p>
   <p>Fitzgerald made a helpless gesture. "I don't know! It worked that way in Kerry's case. In others – I don't know."</p>
   <p>Martha stood up. "I don't think we should talk any more. Kerry needs a doctor. After that we can decide upon that." She pointed to the console.</p>
   <p>Fitzgerald said, "It'd be rather a shame to wreck it, but –" His look was significant.</p>
   <p>The console moved. It came out from its corner with a sidling, rocking gait and walked toward Fitzgerald. As he sprang up, the whiplike tentacles flashed out and seized him. A pale ray shone into the man's eyes.</p>
   <p>Almost instantly it vanished; the tentacles withdrew, and the radio returned to its place. Fitzgerald stood motionless. Martha was on her feet, one hand at her mouth.</p>
   <p>"Fitz!" Her voice shook.</p>
   <p>He hesitated. "Yes? What's the matter?"</p>
   <p>"Are you hurt? What did it do to you?"</p>
   <p>Fitzgerald frowned a little. "Eh? Hurt? I don't –"</p>
   <p>"The radio. What did it do?"</p>
   <p>He looked toward the console. "Something wrong with it? Afraid I'm not much of a repairman, Martha."</p>
   <p>"Fitz." She came forward and gripped his arm. "Listen to me." Quick words spilled from her mouth. The radio. Kerry. Their discussion.</p>
   <p>Fitzgerald looked at her blankly, as though he didn't quite understand. "I guess I'm stupid today. I can't quite understand what you're talking about."</p>
   <p>"The radio – you know! You said it changed Kerry –" Martha paused, staring at the man.</p>
   <p>Fitzgerald was definitely puzzled. Martha was acting strangely. Queer! He'd always considered her a pretty level-headed girl. But now she was talking nonsense. At least, he couldn't figure out the meaning of her words; there was no sense to them.</p>
   <p>And why was she talking about the radio? Wasn't it satisfactory? Kerry had said it was a good buy, with a fine tone and the latest gadgets in it. Fitzgerald wondered, for a fleeting second, if Martha had gone crazy.</p>
   <p>In any case, he was late for his class. He said so. Martha didn't try to stop him when he went out. She was pale as chalk.</p>
   <p>Kerry took out a cigarette. The radio walked over and held a match.</p>
   <p>"Kerry!"</p>
   <p>"Yes, Martha?" His voice was dead.</p>
   <p>She stared at the – the radio. Mars? Another world – another civilization? What was it? What did it want? What was it trying to do?</p>
   <p>Martha let herself out of the house and went to the garage. When she returned, a small hatchet was gripped tightly in her hand.</p>
   <p>Kerry watched. He saw Martha walk over to the radio and lift the hatchet. Then a beam of light shot out, and Martha vanished. A little dust floated up in the afternoon sunlight.</p>
   <p>"Destruction of life-form threatening attack," the radio said, slurring the words together.</p>
   <p>Kerry's brain turned over. He felt sick – dazed and horribly empty. Martha –</p>
   <p>His mind churned. Instinct and emotion fought with something that smothered them. Abruptly the dams crumbled, and the blocks were gone, the barriers down. Kerry cried out hoarsely, inarticulately, and sprang to his feet.</p>
   <p>"Martha!" he yelled.</p>
   <p>She was gone. Kerry looked around. Where–</p>
   <p>What had happened? He couldn't remember.</p>
   <p>He sat down in the chair again, rubbing his forehead. His free hand brought up a cigarette, an automatic reaction that brought instant response. The radio walked forward and held a lighted match ready.</p>
   <p>Kerry made a choking, sick sound and flung himself out of the chair. He remembered now. He picked up the hatchet and sprang toward the console, teeth bared in a mirthless rictus.</p>
   <p>Again the light beam flashed out.</p>
   <p>Kerry vanished. The hatchet thudded on to the carpet.</p>
   <p>The radio walked back to its place and stood motionless once more. A faint clicking proceeded from its radioatomic brain.</p>
   <p>"Subject basically unsuitable," it said, after a moment. "Elimination has been necessary." Click! "Preparation for next subject completed."</p>
   <p>Click.</p>
   <p>"We'll take it," the boy said.</p>
   <p>"You won't be making a mistake," smiled the rental agent. "It's quiet, isolated and the price is quite reasonable."</p>
   <p>"Not so very," the girl put in. "But it is just what we've been looking for."</p>
   <p>The agent shrugged. "Of course, an unfurnished place would run less. But –"</p>
   <p>"We haven't been married long enough to have any furniture," the boy grinned. He put an arm around his wife. "Like it, hon?"</p>
   <p>"Hm-m-m. Who lived here before?"</p>
   <p>The agent scratched his cheek. "Let's see. Some people named Westerfield, I think. It was given to me for listing just about a week ago. Nice place. If I didn't own my own house, I'd jump at it myself."</p>
   <p>"Nice radio," the boy said. "Late model, isn't it?" He went over to examine the console.</p>
   <p>"Come along," the girl urged. "Let's look at the kitchen again."</p>
   <p>"O.K., hon."</p>
   <p>They went out of the room. From the hall came the sound of the agent's smooth voice, growing fainter. Warm afternoon sunlight slanted through the windows.</p>
   <p>For a moment there was silence. Then –</p>
   <p>Click!</p>

    <p>COMPLIMENTS OF THE AUTHOR</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>"If you know what's good for you," said the cat, "you'll get the hell out of here. But quick!"</p>
   <p>Sam Tracy thoughtfully patted the bottle in his topcoat pocket. The gesture was only a momentary confession of weakness, for the <emphasis>Journal</emphasis> reporter wasn't drunk. He had several vices, including a profitable side line of blackmail, but dipsomania wasn't one of them. No, there was a simpler explanation – ventriloquism.</p>
   <p>Tracy's gaze went past the cat to where Baldwin Gwinn's house loomed darkly above him, a big, ramshackle place in an isolated section of Laurel Canyon. There were no cars in the driveway. Good. Tracy didn't want witnesses during his impending interview with Gwinn. Gwinn would pay off, of course; the evidence against the man was overwhelming. And, since Tracy was the only one who possessed that evidence in its entirety, an attempt to collect hush money was clearly indicated. The principle was nothing new, either in Hollywood or to Sam Tracy. He was a lank, dark, saturnine man of forty-odd, with a permanent sneer of cynicism on his aquiline face, and a profound trust in his own ability to come out on top. Till tonight, however, he had not had occasion to cross swords with a magician. But that didn't matter: Gwinn had made a mistake, and the result should mean cash in the bank for Tracy. He could always use money. A succession of very interesting blondes, to which he was partial, the Santa Anita track, the casinos along the Sunset Strip, and zombies, minks, and melodious bowlings – the Hollywood equivalent of wine, women, and song – combined to keep the bank account overdrawn. But Tracy had excellent connections, and was always willing to suppress a scandal, C.O.D. He never put the squeeze on widows or orphans, either. They seldom had money.</p>
   <p>Now in one pocket he had a bottle of whiskey, in another certain significant photostats, and in a third a useful little automatic, very handy for bluffing his way out of tight spots. It was night. Gwinn's house was in a pocket of the Hollywood Hills, isolated, though a few lights gleamed from distant slopes. Stars and a spotlight of a moon were garish overhead. The reporter's sleek dark coupe was parked unobtrusively under a pepper tree, and a fat black cat with white mittens of paws sat on the curbstone twitching its whiskers at Sam Tracy.</p>
   <p>"Ventriloquism, Mr. Gwinn," said the reporter gently, "is O.K. for the sticks. But don't waste it on me."</p>
   <p>"Ventriloquism, hell," the cat replied, glaring balefully. "Don't you know a familiar when you see one? Baldy knows you're coming, and he's all upset. I'd hate to lose him. He's a fine master. I warn you, louse, that if you hurt Baldy, I, personally, will take steps."</p>
   <p>Tracy aimed a kick at the cat, but it was deftly avoided. The creature cursed in a fervid undertone and went behind a convenient bush, from which low, searing oaths proceeded. Tracy's cynical sneer increased in intensity. He walked up the steps and rang the bell.</p>
   <p>"The door's open," said the cat. "You're expected."</p>
   <p>Tracy shrugged and obeyed. The room in which he found himself was big, comfortably furnished, and didn't look at all like the home of a practicing magician. Etchings hung on the walls. A Bokhara rug, slightly singed, was on the floor. At a big table by the window a fat man with a cast in one eye was sitting, staring down unhappily at an open book before him.</p>
   <p>"Hello, Gwinn," the reporter said.</p>
   <p>Gwinn sighed and looked up. "Hello, Tracy. Sit down. Cigar?"</p>
   <p>"No, thanks. You know me?"</p>
   <p>Gwinn pointed to a crystal ball on a tripod in one corner.</p>
   <p>"I saw you in that. You won't believe it, of course, but I'm really a magician."</p>
   <p>Tracy grinned. "Sure. I believe it. So do lots of other people. Like Ina Phairson."</p>
   <p>Gwinn didn't turn a hair. "Such things are necessary in my profession."</p>
   <p>"Rather tough on Ina Phairson, though. And it'd look bad in the papers. In fact, it'd look awful."</p>
   <p>"It would mean the gas chamber, or at best a long prison term. I know. Unfortunately, there's nothing I can do about it."</p>
   <p>Tracy took out the photostats and laid them on the table. He didn't say anything. Gwinn shuffled through the documents, nodding. His thick lips pursed.</p>
   <p>"You have all the evidence, I see. The trouble is that I can't pay blackmail. It isn't allowed."</p>
   <p>"Blackmail's an ugly word," Tracy said. "Let's call it a dividend. Five thousand bucks and this evidence goes up the spout. I'll raise my price tomorrow."</p>
   <p>Gwinn said, "You don't understand. I made a pact with the devil some years ago, and there were certain terms in the contract. One of them is that I'm not allowed to pay blackmail."</p>
   <p>"Suit yourself." Tracy shrugged. "You can keep those photostats. I have the originals, of course. There'll be a story about you in tomorrow's <emphasis>Journal</emphasis>."</p>
   <p>"No – no. I don't want that." Gwinn glanced worriedly at the book before him, and closed it with a snap.</p>
   <p>Tracy's face didn't change, but a new look came into his eyes. That small volume had the look of a diary, or an account book. It would be interesting to thumb through it. There might be names, facts, and figures, all of which would be useful and perhaps profitable.</p>
   <p>The book had a plain cloth cover, and on the front was a small white oval against the brown. In gold script was engraved, "<emphasis>Baldwin Gwinn</emphasis>." Tracy read the name upside down.</p>
   <p>"I haven't all night," he said. "Give me an answer. I don't care what it is. I'll act accordingly."</p>
   <p>Gwinn fingered his thick lower lip. "It's no use, of course," he said under his breath. "Still –"</p>
   <p>He threw a handful of nothing at the fireplace, and flames blazed up with blue brilliance. Then he plucked a wax figurine out of empty air and examined it thoughtfully. It was about six inches high, and was a perfect replica of Tracy.</p>
   <p>He threw it into the fire.</p>
   <p>"I've heard of that," Tracy said. "But I don't believe it."</p>
   <p>"Then it won't work," Gwinn muttered, but waited, nevertheless. For a brief moment Tracy felt uncomfortably warm. He didn't show it. He grinned tightly, and the feeling went away.</p>
   <p>Then, without warning, there was a third person in the room. His name was Andy Monk, and two years ago he had died at the hands of the law, as a result of a feature story Tracy had written. Monk wouldn't pay blackmail, either. And Tracy had always been afraid of the man and his handiness with a knife. For months, till Monk was captured, he had gone in fear of shadows.</p>
   <p>Monk was a shadow now, and Tracy knew that. Hypnosis was old stuff. But the hatred blazing in the man's eyes was horribly disturbing.</p>
   <p>Monk had a gun, and he fired it at Tracy. The bullets weren't real, of course. Tracy braced himself against the impact; almost to his surprise, he realized that he was trembling violently. Hypnotism, but –</p>
   <p>Monk threw away his gun and took out a long-bladed knife. Tracy had always been afraid of that knife. He tried to look through the phantom, but Monk was visibly, if not tangibly, real. Maybe he was tangible, after all. Bullets were one matter. Ghost bullets. A knife was another, somehow. Blue firelight rippled up the blade.</p>
   <p>Tracy didn't want even an intangible knife slicing at his throat. He was scared now. His heart was pounding violently. He hastily took out his automatic and said hoarsely, "Turn it off, Gwinn. Quick!"</p>
   <p>He couldn't see Gwinn, because the room was very dark, and Monk was plunging forward, laughing, the knife driving up viciously. Tracy chewed his lip, gave back a step, and fired. Instantly he regretted the weakness.</p>
   <p>He regretted it even more as Monk vanished, and he saw Gwinn slumped in his chair, the top of his head blown off.</p>
   <p>The magician's eyes were wide open, but unseeing. Tracy stood quite motionless for several minutes breathing hard. Then he shoved the gun back in his pocket, stepped forward, and picked up the brown book from the table. He didn't touch the body. He took out his handkerchief and wiped the doorknobs as he went out of the house, and, standing in the friendly darkness, he found the whiskey bottle in his coat and drank deeply. It helped.</p>
   <p>"But I couldn't –" he said aloud, and broke off, with a quick glance around. Nothing stirred.</p>
   <p>Except the cat. The cat came out of the shadows and looked at Tracy with luminous green eyes.</p>
   <p>"There's still revenge," it said, waving its tail. "And I'm a particularly nasty sort of familiar. I was fond of Baldy. Run along, Sam Tracy. You won't get into any trouble with the police. But you'll get into trouble with me – and my friends. It'll be harder, since you've got the book, but I'll manage." It yawned, flicking a pink tongue at Tracy.</p>
   <p>The reporter thought of posthypnosis, and slowly drew his automatic. The cat went away, with the magic peculiar to cats. Tracy nodded and descended the steps, getting into his car and starting the motor with a nervous jerk.</p>
   <p>It was awkward turning the car around on the narrow, winding road, but he managed it without too much difficulty. Going down the canyon in second gear, Tracy kept his eyes on the black center line and thought hard. Murder. First-degree, at that. But there was no evidence.</p>
   <p>He chewed his lip. He was getting shaky, firing at shadows. Unfortunate that Gwinn happened to be behind that particular shadow. Still ...</p>
   <p>Still, it couldn't be helped, and the worst possible thing to do was brood about it. Much better to shove the incident to the back of his mind. Hell, in the old days in Chicago murder hadn't meant much. Why should it mean anything now?</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, it did. Tracy had always taken pains to keep his skirts clear of messes. By a natural trick of compensation, he had come to regard his blackmailing activities with tolerant satisfaction. In this world, the race was to the swift. A slow horse was handicapped – unless he got the needle. A man smart enough to use a hypo stimulant wasn't necessarily a rat, except according to narrow standards, which did not concern Tracy.</p>
   <p>If you were clever enough to get your hands on smart money, that was all to the good. And it was far, far better than living on a reporter's salary alone.</p>
   <p>But Tracy was shaken. "Self-defense," he said under his breath, and lit a cigarette, illegal in this fire-hazard area. He put it out immediately. It wouldn't do to be stopped by an officer.</p>
   <p>A giant stood threateningly, in the glare of the headlights, gnarled and menacing. Tracy wrenched at the wheel in sudden panic. It was nothing but an oak; just the same, the illusion was frightening. Briefly Tracy had seen the huge face of a hag peering at him, loose mouth writhing, eyes flaming green.</p>
   <p>It was gone now, but the aftertaste of fear was sour in Tracy's mouth. He turned the car into a side road and parked, staring at nothing. Not so good. He couldn't afford hysteria.</p>
   <p>He drank whiskey, shuddered, and wiped his lips with his hand. It was trembling a little. Tracy lay back and breathed deeply, his eyes closed. He'd be all right in a minute. The canyon road was steep and winding, and he preferred not to risk it till his hands stopped shaking.</p>
   <p>Meantime, he remembered Gwinn's diary. It lay on the seat beside him, a flat brown volume rather smaller than an octavo, and Tracy picked it up, switching on the overhead light.</p>
   <p>Oddly enough, the gold script on the front said, "<emphasis>Samuel Tracy</emphasis>."</p>
   <p>Tracy looked at that for a long time. He touched the white oval with an exploratory finger. It was smooth and glossy – parchment, perhaps. Finally he opened the book at random. The page number – 17 – in the upper right-hand corner was in large block numerals, and there was only one sentence, in crude type that seemed hand set. It said:</p>
   <p>"Werewolves can't climb oak trees."</p>
   <p>Tracy read it again. It still said the same thing. Frowning, he turned the page.</p>
   <p>"He's bluffing."</p>
   <p>That was all – two words. Cryptic, to say the least. Obviously, this wasn't Gwinn's diary. It was more like <emphasis>Finnegans Wake</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>Tracy flipped the pages. Page 25 said:</p>
   <p>"Try the windshield."</p>
   <p>Page 26 said:</p>
   <p>"Declare the truth and fear no man." A few pages later, Tracy found this: "Deny everything."</p>
   <p>There were other ambiguous comments: "Don't worry about poor crops," "Aim at his eye," "Don't speak till you're back on earth," and "Try again." As a collection of aphorisms, the book was more than a little cryptic. But Tracy had a queer feeling that he was on the verge of a mystery – an important one, somehow. Only he couldn't find the key.</p>
   <p>The hell with it. Gwinn was a screwball. This volume meant nothing. Or ...</p>
   <p>It was growing chilly. Tracy, with a wry mouth, dropped the book on the seat beside him and started the engine. The one inexplicable thing was the discovery of his name on the volume's brown cover. Previously it had had Gwinn's name – or had it? Thinking back, he wasn't quite certain. At any rate, the doubt was comforting.</p>
   <p>He backed the car, turned, and drove on down the canyon, branching into Laurel, the main thoroughfare. As usual, there was plenty of traffic, since the road was a short cut between Hollywood and the Valley.</p>
   <p>The accident came not quite without warning. On the left of the road was a gully; on the right, an overhanging tree. The headlights picked out something definitely abnormal about that tree. For the second time Tracy saw the gray, rugose, sagging face of a hag, toothless mouth agape in a grin, the deformed head nodding as though in encouragement. He was quite certain that, mingled somehow with the trunk and branches, was the monstrous figure of a woman. The tree had become anthropomorphic. It was wrenching, straining, hunching its heavy shoulders as it swayed and lurched toward the road.</p>
   <p>It fell. Tracy caught his breath and jammed his foot down on the accelerator, swinging the car to the left. The cold motor stuttered hesitantly, without gaining speed, and that was unfortunate. The tree crashed down, and a heavy branch seemed to thrust itself under the wheels. Tires blew out with sickening bangs. The breath-stopping sickness of imminent danger froze Tracy into paralysis as the coupé went over the curb, toppling, skidding down, turning over and over till it came to rest on its side.</p>
   <p>Tracy's head rang like a bell; white flashes of pain lanced through it. He was jammed awkwardly behind the steering wheel, which, luckily, had not snapped off. He had avoided impalement, at any rate. He reached fumblingly for the key to snap off the ignition, but a flicker of fire told him he was too late.</p>
   <p>The car was ablaze.</p>
   <p>Painfully Tracy tried to right himself. The shatterproof glass had not broken, and he thrust upward against the door, now above his head. It was jammed. He could see stars through the glass, and a coiling veil of thin smoke that partly obscured them. A reddening glow grew brighter. When the fire reached the gas tank ...</p>
   <p>He heard distant shouts. Help was coming, but probably it would not come in time. With a choking cry Tracy strained up against the door; he could not budge it. If he could break the glass –</p>
   <p>He sought for a tool. There was none. The dashboard compartment was jammed, and, in his awkward position, he could not remove a shoe to hammer against the glass. The acrid smell grew stronger. Red light flickered.</p>
   <p>The sharp corner of something was jammed against his side, and Tracy, hoping it might be a loose bit of metal heavy enough to serve his purpose, clutched at it. He found himself staring at the book. The white circle on the cover was luminous, and traced darkly against the whiteness were two Arabic numerals:</p>
   <p>25</p>
   <p>The need for self-preservation sharpens the faculties. It was instinct that brought vividly to Tracy the memory of what he had read on Page 25 of the book. The enigma of the message was suddenly elucidated.</p>
   <p>"Try the windshield."</p>
   <p>Tracy thrust at the long plate glass with his palm, and the windshield fell out. A breath of cool air blew in against his sweating face. The crackling of flames was very loud now.</p>
   <p>He kept a tight grip on the book as he wormed his way through the gap, skinning his shin rather badly; and he ran down the gully, gasping for breath, till the red firelight had faded. A booming roar told him the gas tank had exploded. Tracy sat down, feeling weak, and looked at the book. It was an oblong, darker shadow in the faint moonlight.</p>
   <p>"My God," he said.</p>
   <p>After a while he put the book in a pocket of his tattered topcoat and clambered out of the gully. Cars were parked along the curb, and men were moving about, using flashlights. Tracy walked back toward the crowd.</p>
   <p>He was conscious of irritation at the impending scene. The only thing he wanted, just now, was a chance to examine the book privately. There was a point at which skepticism stopped. Tracy had run up against enough news curiosa in the past to retain a certain amount of credulity. The whole thing might be merely a coincidence – but he didn't think so.</p>
   <p>There was a confusion of questioning, loud, rather pointless conversation, and assurances, on Tracy's part, that he was unhurt. With an officer, he went to a near-by house and telephoned his insurance company. Meanwhile a taxi had been summoned.</p>
   <p>Tracy ordered the cabman to stop in Hollywood at a convenient bar, where he gulped several whiskey sours and fingered the book in his pocket. He didn't quite dare to examine it there, however, and, in any case, the lighting was indirect – perhaps on the questionable principle that people seldom appear at their best when they are tight. Replenished and conscious of a mounting excitement, Tracy reached his Wilshire apartment at last, closed the door behind him, and switched on the light.</p>
   <p>He stood motionless for a time, just looking around. Then he went to a couch, lit a reading lamp, and took the brown volume from his pocket.</p>
   <p>The inset white disk on the front cover was blank. His own name was scrawled in gilt lettering against the dull brown cloth. He turned to Page 25. It said, "Try the windshield."</p>
   <p>Tracy closed the book and opened it at the flyleaf, which was blank. The next page was more interesting. In the familiar hand type, his own name leaped up at him.</p>
   <p>Dear Mr. Tracy:</p>
   <p>By this time, you may already have discovered the peculiar qualities of this <emphasis>grimoire</emphasis>. Its powers are limited, and only ten page references are allotted to each owner. Use them with discrimination.</p>
   <p>Compliments of the author.</p>
   <p>Cryptic – but significant! Tracy looked up <emphasis>grimoire</emphasis>, but the word wasn't in his dictionary. It meant a book of magic, he remembered rather vaguely, a collection of spells.</p>
   <p>Thoughtfully he flipped the book's pages again. Spells? Advice, rather. Certainly the advice about the coupé's windshield had come in very handy.</p>
   <p>Tracy's lips tightened in a crooked smile. One advantage of the accident: he had forgotten to be worried by the murder! Maybe that wasn't so good. If the police grew suspicious – But there was no reason why they should be. His presence in Laurel Canyon was easily explained; the boulevard was a well-traveled thoroughfare. And Gwinn's body might not be discovered for days, in that isolated section.</p>
   <p>He stood up, stripping off the ragged overcoat and tossing it aside with a gesture of distaste. Tracy liked clothes, with an almost sensuous feeling. He went into the bathroom to start the shower, and came back instantly, followed by the beginnings of steam clouds. He picked up the book from the couch.</p>
   <p>It lay on a stand as he bathed and donned pajamas and a robe. It was in his hand as he slippered back into the living room, and his gaze was upon it as he mixed himself a drink. It was a stiff drink and, as he sipped the whiskey, Tracy felt a warm, restful languor beginning to seep into his mind and body. Till this moment he had not realized how jangled were his nerves.</p>
   <p>Now, leaning back, he pondered on the book. Magic? Were there such things? He thumbed through the pages again, but the printed lines had not altered in the least. Extraordinary, and quite illogical, how that message about the windshield had saved his life. The other pages – most of them bore sentences wild to the point of lunacy. "Werewolves can't climb oak trees." So what?</p>
   <p>Tracy fixed himself another drink. He was going somewhat beyond his capacity tonight, for fairly obvious reasons. But he didn't show it, except for a glisten of perspiration on his high, tanned forehead.</p>
   <p>"This should develop into something interesting," a soft voice said.</p>
   <p>It was the cat. Fat, glossy, and handsome, it sat on a chair opposite Tracy, watching the man with enigmatic eyes. The mobile mouth and tongue of a cat, he thought, were well suited for human speech.</p>
   <p>The cat rippled its shoulder muscles. "Do you still think this is ventriloquism?" it asked. "Or have you progressed to hallucinations?"</p>
   <p>Tracy stood up, walked across the room, and slowly extended his hand. "I'd like to make certain you're real," he said. "May I –"</p>
   <p>"Gently. Don't try any tricks. My claws are sharp, and my magic's sharper."</p>
   <p>Satisfied by the feel of the warm fur, Tracy drew back and looked down consideringly at the creature. "All right," he said, his voice a little thick. "We've progressed this far, anyhow. I'm talking to you – admitting your existence. Fair enough."</p>
   <p>The cat nodded. "True. I came here to congratulate you on escaping the dryad, and to tell you I'm not discouraged."</p>
   <p>Tracy sat down again. "Dryad, eh? I always thought dryads were pretty. Like nymphs."</p>
   <p>"Fairy tales," the cat said succinctly. "The Grecian equivalent of yellow journalism. Satyrs only made love to young deciduous dryads, my friend. The older ones – well! You may be able to imagine what the dryad of a California sequoia would be like."</p>
   <p>"I think so."</p>
   <p>"Well, you're wrong. The older an anthropomorphic being grows, the less rigidly the dividing lines are drawn. Ever notice the sexlessness of old human beings? They die, of course, before they progress farther than that. Eventually the line between human being and god is lost, then between human being and animal, and between animal and plant. Finally there's a commingling of sentient clay. Beyond that you'd not care to go. But the sequoia dryads have gone beyond it." The cat eyes watched, alert and inscrutable. Tracy sensed some definite purpose behind this conversation. He waited.</p>
   <p>"My name, by the way, is Meg," the cat said.</p>
   <p>"Female, I presume?"</p>
   <p>"In this incarnation. Familiars in their natural habitat are sexless. When aliens manifest themselves on earth, they're limited by terrestrial laws – to a certain extent, anyway. You may have noticed that nobody saw the dryad but you."</p>
   <p>"There wasn't anybody else around."</p>
   <p>"Exactly," Meg said, with an air of satisfaction.</p>
   <p>Tracy considered, conscious more than ever that he was dueling with the creature. "O.K.," he nodded. "Now let's get down to cases. You were Gwinn's – eh? – familiar. What does that imply?"</p>
   <p>"I served him. A familiar, Tracy, serves a wizard as a catalyst."</p>
   <p>"Come again."</p>
   <p>"Catalysis: a chemic reaction promoted by the presence of a third unaffected substance. Read 'magic' for 'chemic.' Take cane sugar and water, add sulphuric acid, and you get glucose and levulose. Take a pentagram and ox blood, add me, and you get a demon named Pharnegar. He's the dowser god," Meg added. "Comes in handy for locating hidden treasures, but he has his limitations."</p>
   <p>Tracy thought that over. It seemed logical. All through the centuries, folklore had spoken of the warlock's familiar. What purpose the creature had served was problematical. A glorified demoniac valet? Rather silly.</p>
   <p>A catalyst was much more acceptable, somehow, especially to poor Tracy's alcohol-distorted brain.</p>
   <p>"It seems to me we might make a bargain," he said, staring at Meg. "You're out of a job now, aren't you? Well, I could use a little magical knowledge."</p>
   <p>"Fat chance," the cat said scornfully. "Do you think for a minute magic can be mastered by a correspondence course? It's like any highly trained profession. You have to learn how to handle the precision tools, how to train your insight, how to – My master, Tracy, it's something more than a university course! It takes a natural linguist to handle the spells. And trained, whiplash responses. A perfect sense of timing. Gwinn took the course for twenty-three years before he got his goatskin. And, of course, there's the initial formality of the fee."</p>
   <p>Tracy grunted. "You know magic, apparently. Why can't you –"</p>
   <p>"Because," Meg said very softly, "you killed Gwinn. I won't outlast him. And I had been looking forward to a decade or two more on Earth. In this plane, I'm free from certain painful duties that are mine elsewhere."</p>
   <p>"Hell?"</p>
   <p>"Anthropomorphically speaking, yes. But your idea of Hell isn't mine. Which is natural, since in my normal state my senses aren't the same as yours."</p>
   <p>Meg jumped down from the chair and began to wander around the room. Tracy watched it – her – closely. His hand felt for and clutched the book.</p>
   <p>The cat said, "This will be an interesting game of wits. The book will give you considerable help – but I have my magic."</p>
   <p>"You're determined to – to kill me?" Tracy reached for his topcoat. "Why?"</p>
   <p>"I told you. Revenge."</p>
   <p>"Can't we bargain?"</p>
   <p>"No," Meg said. "There's nothing you can offer me that would be any inducement. I'll stick around, and enlist a salamander or something to get rid of you."</p>
   <p>"Suppose I put a bullet into you?" Tracy asked, taking his automatic from the coat. He leveled it. "You're flesh and blood. Well?" .</p>
   <p>The cat sat down, eyeing Tracy steadily. "Try it," Meg said.</p>
   <p>For no sensible reason, the reporter felt curiously frightened. He lowered the gun.</p>
   <p>"I rather wish," Meg said, "that you had tried to kill me."</p>
   <p>"Oh, hell," Tracy grunted, and got up, the book in his hand. "I'm going to get another drink." Struck by a thought, he paused. "For all I know, you may still be a hallucination. A drunken one. In that case –" He grinned. "May I offer you a saucer of cream, Meg?"</p>
   <p>"Thanks," said the cat appreciatively. "I'd like it."</p>
   <p>Tracy, pouring the cream, grinned at his reflection in the kitchen window. "<emphasis>Toujours gai</emphasis>, all right," he soliloquized. "Maybe I should put rat poison in this. Oh, well."</p>
   <p>Meg lapped the cream, keeping her eyes on Tracy, who was dividing his attention between his drink and the book. "I wonder about this," he said. "There doesn't seem to be anything magical about it. Do messages appear – like a clairvoyant's slate?"</p>
   <p>The cat snorted delicately. "Things don't work that way," she said. "The book's got fifty pages. Well, you'll find an answer to every conceivable human problem on one of those pages."</p>
   <p>Tracy frowned. "That's ridiculous."</p>
   <p>"Is it? History repeats itself, and human beings live a life of cliches. Has it occurred to you, Tracy, that humanity's life pattern can be boiled down to a series of equations? Fifty of them, I think. You can find the lowest common denominator, if you go far enough, but that's far beyond human understanding. As I see it, the author of that book analyzed humanity's lives, boiled them down to the basic patterns, and expressed those equations as grammatical sentences. A mere matter of semantics," Meg finished.</p>
   <p>"I don't think I get it. Wait a minute. Maybe I do. 13ab minus b equals 13a. '13ab' stands for eggs: Don't count your chickens before they are hatched."</p>
   <p>"Muddy reasoning, but you have the idea," Meg acknowledged. "Besides, you forgot the hen."</p>
   <p>"Incubator," Tracy said absently, and brooded over the book. "You mean, then, that this has the answer to every known human problem. What about this: 'Werewolves can't climb oak trees'? How often does anybody meet a werewolf?"</p>
   <p>"Symbolism is involved. And personal psychological associations. The third-but-last owner of that book, by the way, was a werewolf," Meg purred. "You'd be surprised how beautifully it all fits."</p>
   <p>"Who wrote it?" Tracy asked.</p>
   <p>The cat shrugged, a beautifully liquid gesture. "A mathematician, of course. I understand he developed the idea as a hobby."</p>
   <p>"Satan?"</p>
   <p>"Don't give yourself airs. Human beings aren't important. Earth isn't important, except to provide intellectual exercise to others. Still and all, this is a simple world, with too little of the uncertainty factor."</p>
   <p>Tracy started to laugh. After a while he said, "I just realized I was sitting here discussing semantics with a cat."</p>
   <p>But Meg had vanished.</p>
   <p>Familiarity with an enemy destroys wariness, and no doubt the cat knew that well enough. Obviously Tracy should have been on guard. The fact that Meg had drunk his cream – the equivalent of bread and salt – meant nothing; cats are amoral, familiars, by preference, immoral. The combination was perilous.</p>
   <p>But Tracy, his mind slightly hazy with whiskey, clutched the book like a buckler and felt safe. He was thinking about formulas of logic. "Matter of deduction," he muttered. "I suppose the author made a lot of graphs and things and arrived at his conclusions that way. Tested them by induction. <emphasis>Whew</emphasis>.'" It was a dizzying thought.</p>
   <p>Again he examined the book. The white circle on the cover was luminous again, and there was a number visible there. Tracy's stomach lurched.</p>
   <p>Page 34.</p>
   <p>He glanced around hastily, expecting anything; but the apartment seemed unchanged. Meg had not reappeared.</p>
   <p>Page 34 said, "Canaries need oxygen."</p>
   <p>Canaries?</p>
   <p>Tracy remembered. A few days ago, a friend had given him an expensive roller canary, and he had not yet got rid of the creature. Its cage hung in a corner, covered with a white cloth. No sound proceeded from it.</p>
   <p>Tracy went over and pulled the cover away. The canary was in trouble. It was lying on the bottom of the cage, kicking spasmodically, beak wide open.</p>
   <p>Oxygen?</p>
   <p>Tracy whistled under his breath and whirled to the windows, yanking them open one by one. The gusts of cold, fresh air made his head spin. He hadn't realized how drunk he was.</p>
   <p>Whiskey, however, didn't account for the feeling of sick nausea in his stomach. He watched the canary slowly revive, and chewed at his lip. The air in the room hadn't been depleted enough to kill a bird. This wasn't a coal mine.</p>
   <p>A coal mine – gas – <emphasis>yeah</emphasis>! Tracy, grinning tightly, dropped to his knees beside the gas radiator. As he had expected, the cock was turned on full, and he could hear a soft hissing.</p>
   <p>Meg didn't always depend on magic. And a cat's paws were handy little tools.</p>
   <p>Tracy closed the valve and made a circuit of the apartment, finding another open radiator in the bedroom. He attended to that. The canary recovered and peeped feebly. Tracy threw the cover back over its cage and considered.</p>
   <p>The book. The numerals on the cover had faded again.</p>
   <p>He felt a resurgence of panic. Ten references were allowed him. He had used two. That left eight – only eight. And Meg was a resourceful familiar, hell bent on revenge.</p>
   <p>There was a thought stirring at the back of Tracy's mind, but it refused to emerge. He relaxed and closed his eyes. After a while the thought came out of hiding.</p>
   <p>In his hands he held a magical power whose potentialities were unlimited. The brown book had the answer to every human problem. If Napoleon had possessed it, or Luther, or Caesar – well! Life was a succession of problems. Men were handicapped by their inability to visualize the complete equation. So they made mistakes.</p>
   <p>But this book, Tracy thought, told the right answer.</p>
   <p>Ironic that its powers should be wasted. That was what the situation amounted to. Ten references were allowed; after that, Meg would get her revenge, unhindered by the book's countermagic. What a waste!</p>
   <p>Tracy rubbed his temples hard. A gold mine had been dumped in his lap, and he was trying to figure out a way of using it. Any time danger threatened, the book would give the solution, according to the equation of logic. Then the magic was, so to speak, passive.</p>
   <p>Not quite. If Tracy faced financial ruin, that would certainly come under the classification of danger. Unless the meaning embraced only the danger of bodily harm. He hoped there were no such limitations.</p>
   <p>On that assumption, if Tracy faced ruin, the book would give a page number that would save him. Would it simply point out a way of returning to his former financial status? No. Because that status had already been proved unsound and dangerous by the mere fact of its cancellation.</p>
   <p>Casuistic reasoning, perhaps, but with clever manipulation, Tracy felt confident that he could play the cards close to his chest. He wanted money. Very well. He would place himself in a position where financial ruin was imminent, and the book would come to his rescue.</p>
   <p>He hoped.</p>
   <p>There were only eight page references left, and it would not do to waste them in making tests. Tracy skimmed through the book, wondering if he could apply the messages himself. It didn't seem probable. "Say no to everything," for example. In special circumstances, that was no doubt good advice. But who was to know when those circumstances would arise? Only the book, of course.</p>
   <p>And – "An assassin awaits." Excellent advice! It would have been invaluable to Caesar – to most of the Caesars, in fact. Knowing that a murderer was in ambush, it would be easy to take precautions. But one couldn't be on guard all the time.</p>
   <p>The logic was perfect, as far as it went. But one element was ever lacking – the time-variable. Since that particular variable depended entirely on the life pattern of the book's owner, it was manifestly impossible for it to be any rational sort of a constant.</p>
   <p>Meantime, there was Meg. Meg was murderously active, and determined on her vengeance. If Tracy used the book – could use the book – to get what he wanted personally, he'd use up the other eight chances and leave himself unguarded against attack. Fame and fortune mean little to a corpse.</p>
   <p>A red glow came from the window. A small, lizard-like creature crawled into view. There were suction pads on its toes, like a gecko's, and a faint smell of charring paint came with it as it scuttled over the sill. It looked like red-hot metal.</p>
   <p>Tracy looked at the book. It was unchanged. This wasn't a danger, then. But it might have been – if he hadn't turned off the gas. Introduce a blazing salamander into a gas-filled apartment, and –</p>
   <p>Yeah.</p>
   <p>Tracy picked up a siphon at his elbow and squirted soda at the salamander. Clouds of steam arose. The creature hissed and fled back the way it had come.</p>
   <p>Very well. Eight chances were still left. Eight moves in which to outwit and destroy Meg. Less than that – as few as possible, in fact – if any chances were to be left. And it was necessary to leave a few, or Tracy's status in life would remain unchanged. Merely escaping from danger wasn't enough. He wanted –</p>
   <p>What?</p>
   <p>He got pencil and paper and sat down to figure it out. Happiness was too vague – another variable, depending on the individual. Power? Women? Money? He had them all, in sufficient quantity. Security?</p>
   <p>Security. That was a human constant. Security against the ominous shadows of the future. But one couldn't simply wish for security. The book didn't work that way. Abstractions were beyond its scope, seemingly.</p>
   <p>What gave people security? Money was the first answer, yet that was not satisfactory. Tracy tried a new tack. Who was secure?</p>
   <p><emphasis>Paisanos</emphasis>, on the whole, were more contented than potentates. However, Tracy didn't want to be a <emphasis>paisano</emphasis>. What about Herrick, the publisher? Security? Well, no. Not when the world itself was unstable.</p>
   <p>In the end Tracy decided nothing. Perhaps the best solution was to get himself into the worst spot possible, and leave the rest to the book. And, if the book failed him ...</p>
   <p>It might do just that. But Tracy was a gambler. What was the worst thing that could happen now?</p>
   <p>The answer was obvious. The loss of the book!</p>
   <p>A fire was laid ready in the grate. Tracy touched a match to a fold of newspaper, and watched the flames creep up till the hardwood was crackling. If he purposely rendered himself helpless, the book should logically reveal a panacea – a cure-all that would eliminate all his difficulties. It was worth trying.</p>
   <p>Tracy grinned at his own cleverness.</p>
   <p>He threw the book into the fire, face up. The flames licked up hungrily. Instantly two numerals appeared on the white oval.</p>
   <p>43</p>
   <p>The ultimate answer! The cure for the loss of the book!</p>
   <p>Tracy plunged in his hand and snatched the volume out of the grate, amid a scattering of embers. The brown cover was slightly singed, but the pages were unharmed.</p>
   <p>Breathing a little hoarsely, he crouched on his hams and turned to Page 43.</p>
   <p>It said, with a certain touch of naïve malice:</p>
   <p>"That's right."</p>
   <p>Tracy got up, face expressionless. He picked up his empty highball glass and smashed it against the wall. That done, he went to the window and looked out unseeingly at the night.</p>
   <p>Seven references were left.</p>
   <p>Tracy slept well enough, untroubled by dreams, and with the book under his pillow. The next morning a cold shower and black coffee steadied him for the forthcoming ordeal. He had no illusions about what was going to happen. Meg had not given up.</p>
   <p>It was late when he arrived at the <emphasis>Journal</emphasis>. Dusty sunlight slanted into the city room. Copy boys scuttled here and there with flimsies, and, all in all, it looked like a set for any motion picture involving newspaper life. Rewrite men were busy rewriting, and glass-paneled partitions toward the back hinted at irate editors ready to send out star reporters on perilous assignments. Tim Hatton, a cameraman, was moodily shaking dice in a corner.</p>
   <p>"Hiya, Sam," he said around a cigarette. "Roll you a couple."</p>
   <p>MacGregor, a Denver man who had grown old in harness, lifted a bald head from his desk to leer at Tracy. "Tim Hatton has been going to movies," he said hoarsely. "Tim Hatton has been reading all about Charlie MacArthur and Ben Hecht. Man and boy, I've been writing copy all over the country, and not even with Bonfils have I known a guy more determined to be a newspaperman. Pretty soon he'll be telling you about his hangover, Tracy, and offering you a drink out of that pretty little silver flask on his hip. Ah, youth." MacGregor returned to his work and ate a lemon drop.</p>
   <p>"Sourpuss," Hatton said, pink around the ears. "Why don't he quit riding me?"</p>
   <p>"Go out and snap a murderer," MacGregor said. "Push right through a cordon of police – pardon, harness bulls, I mean – and go into the building where Public Enemy Number One is cornered. I wish motion pictures had never been invented. These so-and-so cubs who come in here, wet behind the ears, expecting to find Eddie Robinson behind the city desk."</p>
   <p>Tracy was glancing through a still-damp copy of the <emphasis>Journal</emphasis>, wondering if Gwinn's body had been found yet. He said absently, "Them days have gone forever, Tim."</p>
   <p>"So you say," Hatton grunted, and peered at his wrist watch. "I've got a date with Barney Donn in half an hour. Well?"</p>
   <p>MacGregor said in a mechanical voice, "Barney Donn, Arnie Rothstein's successor, Chicago beer baron under Capone, served time on a Federal tax rap, biggest gambler in Florida, left Hialeah a week ago. What's he doing here?"</p>
   <p>"That's my job to find out," Hatton said. "He's news."</p>
   <p>Tracy put down the paper. "I'll go along. I used to know Barney." He didn't mention that once he'd blackmailed Donn for a couple of grand, and that he was vaguely worried about the gambler's appearance in Hollywood. Had Meg anything to do with this? Donn had a long memory. It might be wise to take the bull by the horns.</p>
   <p>MacGregor crunched a lemon drop. "Remember Rothstein," he said sardonically. Hatton cursed him casually and picked up his camera.</p>
   <p>"Ready, Sam?"</p>
   <p>"Yeah." Tracy dropped the <emphasis>Journal</emphasis>. Nothing in it about Gwinn. He hesitated, wondering whether he should check up on the obit file, but decided not to risk it. He followed Hatton out of the office, past the reception clerk, and watched the cameraman settle a mangled hat on the back of his head. Smoke drifted lazily from Hatton's nostrils.</p>
   <p>The office cat gave Tracy a start, but in a moment he saw that it wasn't Meg. But the creature gave him something to think about. He began to wonder what the familiar would try next.</p>
   <p>He was at cross-purposes with Meg. Meg had little time, but lots of magic. Tracy had little magic, but it was to his advantage to play for time. Meg had said she wouldn't outlast Gwinn. How long would she last? Maybe she'd grow more and more tenuous, till she finally vanished completely.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, he had the book.</p>
   <p>But he wasn't certain yet of the best way to use it. He kept it handy, just in case Barney Donn was in Meg's employ. The gambler had a reputation for squareness, but he was a decidedly tough customer.</p>
   <p>The hotel clerk took their names and said to go right up. It was a big hotel, one of the best in Los Angeles. And Donn had taken a suite.</p>
   <p>He greeted them at the door, a stocky, swarthy man with a broken nose and a broad, toothy grin. "Jeez, Sam Tracy," he said. "Who's the punk with you?"</p>
   <p>"Hi, Barney. This is Tim Hatton. We're both on the <emphasis>Journal</emphasis>. And you can drop the colloquialisms. We'll give you the sort of write-up you want, anyway."</p>
   <p>Donn chuckled. "Come on in. I got in the habit of using this lingo in Chi, and I can't break myself of it. I'm a Jekyll and Hyde. Come in, will you?"</p>
   <p>Tracy wasn't as relieved as he might have been. As Hatton went on into the apartment, he lingered a bit behind, touching Donn's sleeve. The gambler opened wide brown eyes.</p>
   <p>"What's up?"</p>
   <p>"What are you doing here?"</p>
   <p>"Vacation," Donn said. "And I want to do some gambling out here. I hear nice things about it."</p>
   <p>"That's the only reason?"</p>
   <p>"Yeah. I get it. You're thinking –" Donn chuckled again. "Look, Tracy. You put the squeeze on me once, but you won't do it again. I cleaned up my record, see?"</p>
   <p>"So have I," the reporter said ambiguously. "Matter of fact, I'm sorry I had to ask you for that dough, but –"</p>
   <p>"Money!" Donn said, shrugging. "It ain't hard to make. If you're thinking I hold a grudge, the answer is no. Sure, I'd like to get that dough back from you – just to square accounts – but what the hell! I never killed anybody in my life."</p>
   <p>And, with that comforting assurance, he led the way into the next room.</p>
   <p>Two men were sitting at a table, local gambling big shots, and they were watching Hatton do card tricks. The photographer was enjoying himself immensely. His cigarette was on the verge of burning his lower lip, and he shuffled and flipped the cards with remarkable dexterity.</p>
   <p>"See?" he said.</p>
   <p>"How about a hand?" Donn asked Tracy. "We haven't played for years."</p>
   <p>Tracy hesitated. "O.K. A hand or two. But I'm not sticking my neck out." He knew that Donn was an honest gambler, or he might have refused outright.</p>
   <p>Liquor was on the table, and Donn poured and passed the glasses. "I played a little on the plane, but I want to make sure my luck's holding in California. I had a good streak at Hialeah ... Stud, eh?"</p>
   <p>"Ante?" Hatton was beaming.</p>
   <p>"Five hundred."</p>
   <p>"Uh!"</p>
   <p>"Make it a hundred to start, then," Donn grinned. "Can do?"</p>
   <p>Hatton nodded and took out his wallet. Tracy did the same, flipping bills on the table and exchanging them for chips. The other two men silently drank whiskey and waited.</p>
   <p>The first hand was mild, Donn winning the pot with a low straight, nothing wild. Hatton took the next hand, and Tracy the third, which was satisfyingly fat with blue chips. He said, "One more, and I check out."</p>
   <p>"Aw –" That was Hatton.</p>
   <p>"Stay if you like," Tracy told him. "It's a straight game, but Barney's got card sense."</p>
   <p>"Always had," Donn said, shuffling. "Even as a kid. Stick around a while, Sam."</p>
   <p>Tracy drew to a flush, and missed. Donn won. He raked in a few chips as the reporter stood up.</p>
   <p>"That's all, Barney. Let's have the interview, and we'll push off. Or I will, if Hatton wants to stay."</p>
   <p>"Stick around," Donn repeated, his glance meeting Tracy's.</p>
   <p>"Sorry –"</p>
   <p>"Look, Sam," Donn said argumentatively, "somehow I got a feeling you owe me some money. Now, why not be fair? I hear you're pretty well fixed these days. Don't be a piker, for Pete's sake."</p>
   <p>"You – uh – insist?" Tracy's voice was strained.</p>
   <p>Donn grinned. He nodded.</p>
   <p>Tracy sat down again, chewing his lip. He scowled at the deck.</p>
   <p>"Think it's cold?" Donn asked. "Want to deal?"</p>
   <p>"You don't play with marked cards," Tracy admitted. "Oh, hell! Let's have some chips. What am I worrying about?" He emptied his wallet.</p>
   <p>Fifteen minutes later he said, "Take a check?"</p>
   <p>Half an hour later he was signing IOU's.</p>
   <p>The game was fast, hard, and dangerous. It was straight, too, but no less perilous for that. The laws of chance were consistently kicked in the pants. Some men have a talent for cards, a sixth sense which is partly memory and partly a keen understanding of psychology. Donn had that talent.</p>
   <p>The pendulum swung back and forth. The ante went up. Gradually Tracy began to win again. He and Donn were the heavy winners, and at the end of an hour and a half, he and Hatton were the only ones left in the game, except, of course, Donn himself.</p>
   <p>Once Tracy thought Donn was bluffing, and called, but he was wrong. Meantime the stakes mounted. At last Tracy got what he thought was a good hand, and raised on the strength of it.</p>
   <p>Donn met and raised. Hatton did the same. Tracy considered his cards – and thrust a stack of blues into the center.</p>
   <p>He wrote another check, bought more chips, and raised again. Hatton dropped out. Donn met and raised.</p>
   <p>As Tracy pushed his last chips across the table, he realized that this cleaned out his bank account. Simultaneously he felt a curious warmth against his hip.</p>
   <p>The book.</p>
   <p>Was there another page reference on the cover? Tracy didn't know whether to be glad or sorry. He met Donn's eyes, brown and sparkling with excitement, and saw that the gambler was going to raise again.</p>
   <p>He couldn't meet another raise.</p>
   <p>He stood up abruptly. "Excuse me. Back in a minute," he said, and before Donn could protest, he headed for the bathroom. The door slammed shut behind him, and he jerked the book out of his pocket. The page number, black against luminous white, was 12.</p>
   <p>And the message was: "He's bluffing."</p>
   <p>"I'll be damned," Tracy said under his breath.</p>
   <p>"That," a low voice remarked, "is inevitable, I'd say. But such perspicacity is rare – eh, Belphegor?"</p>
   <p>"Bah!" was the hoarse reply. "Always talk. Action, I'd say – quick, hard, and bloody."</p>
   <p>Tracy looked around and saw nothing unusual. He fumbled for the knob behind him, opened the door, and stepped back into the room where he had left Donn and the others.</p>
   <p>Only, he saw as he turned, it wasn't the same room.</p>
   <p>It was not, strictly speaking, a room at all. It was a three-dimensional surrealist landscape come to life. Overhead was empty gray sky, and a flat plain, curiously distorted as to perspective, stretched to a foreshortened horizon. Odd objects were here and there, inanimate, and with no sensible reason for their presence. Most of them were partially melted.</p>
   <p>Three creatures sat in a row facing Tracy.</p>
   <p>One was a lean man with huge feet and the head of a unicorn. One was a saturnine, naked giant with malformed horns and a lion's tail. One was – ugh! A sad face with a crown regarded Tracy ill-temperedly. From the bulbous body, with its twelve spider's legs, grew the head of a frog and the head of a cat – an unholy trinity, as it were.</p>
   <p>Tracy turned around. The door through which he had come was still there, but it was just a door, standing unsupported, with no framework around it. Moreover, it seemed to be locked, as he found after a frantic tug at the knob.</p>
   <p>"Quick, hard, and bloody," said the same hoarse voice, which came from the squinting, saturnine giant with the lion's tail. "Trust me for that."</p>
   <p>"Crudity, always crudity," the anthropomorphic unicorn murmured, clasping its knee between its hands. "You're a relic of the dark ages, Belphegor."</p>
   <p>"You're a jackass, Amduscias," said Belphegor. The three-headed spidery horror said nothing. It regarded Tracy unwinkingly.</p>
   <p>"Look, human," Amduscias began, squinting along its horn, "devil to man, have you any preference?"</p>
   <p>Tracy croaked inarticulately. He found his voice with some difficulty.</p>
   <p>"P-preference? About what? Where – How'd I get here?"</p>
   <p>"Death hath a thousand something doors and they do open both ways," Amduscias quoted inaccurately.</p>
   <p>"I'm not dead."</p>
   <p>"No," said the demon rather reluctantly. "But you will be. You will be."</p>
   <p>"Tooth, horn, and claw," Belphegor interjected.</p>
   <p>"Where am I, then?"</p>
   <p>"Oh, it's a hinterland," Amduscias said. "Bael made it specially for our rendezvous." He glanced at the silent three-headed creature. "Meg sent us. You know Meg, don't you?"</p>
   <p>"Yeah. Yeah, I know her." Tracy licked his lips. He remembered the book, and lifted it with unsteady hands. The number on the cover was unchanged – 12.</p>
   <p>"Sit down," Amduscias invited. "We have time for a talk before you die."</p>
   <p>"Talk," Belphegor growled, yanking viciously at his tail. "Pah! Fool!"</p>
   <p>The unicorn head bobbed solemnly. "I am a philosopher. There's no need to keep staring at Bael, human. He may strike you as ugly, but I assure you we're a handsome group, as Hell's lords go. If it's Bael's plurality that troubles you, you should see Asmodee. Our Eurynome – the progenitor of the bogeyman. Sit down and let's talk. It's been years since I spoke with a human being outside of Hell. And the ones in Hell can't carry on a lucid conversation," Amduscias went on ruminatively. "I used to talk with Voltaire a great deal, but since around 1850 he's done nothing but laugh. Mad, quite mad," the demon finished.</p>
   <p>Tracy couldn't keep his eyes off Bael. The petulant, melancholy human face regarded him fixedly. The toad face stared at the sky. The cat face looked at nothing. It wasn't Meg, though. That was something. Or was it? Tracy's nails dug into his palms.</p>
   <p>"What do you want?"</p>
   <p>"You speak specifically, I assume – of now." Amduscias hunched his shoulders. "Be still, Belphegor," he added irritably. "If you had your way, this human being would be in tattered shreds within seconds. And then what? Back to Hell for us."</p>
   <p>"What's wrong with Hell?" Belphegor demanded, tugging at his tail, as though giving himself some eerie sort of spinal adjustment. "Too crude for your cultivated tastes?" He dug a reddish clot from under a toe claw.</p>
   <p>"Exactly. I don't like this hinterland. Bael's got the damnedest ideas for scenery."</p>
   <p>"Result of a tripartite mind, I suppose," Amduscias said. "Well, human, how do you prefer to be killed?"</p>
   <p>"I don't," Tracy denied.</p>
   <p>Belphegor grunted. "Stop fooling around. Meg told us to get rid of this human being. Let's get it over and go back home."</p>
   <p>"W-wait a minute," Tracy interrupted then. "Can't we straighten this out somehow?" The feel of the book in his hand gave him an unreasonable confidence. "Meg's only a familiar. What right has she got to tell you what to do?"</p>
   <p>"Courtesies of the trade," Amduscias explained. "Now tell us how you'd prefer to be killed."</p>
   <p>"If you had your way," Belphegor said bitterly, "you'd talk him to death."</p>
   <p>The other rubbed his horn. "It's an intellectual amusement. I don't pretend to be another Scheherazade, but there are ways of driving human beings to insanity through – um – conversation. Yes, I vote for that method."</p>
   <p>"My master, how you do run on!" Belphegor exclaimed. "All right, I vote for ripping him apart, cell by cell." His broad gray mouth twitched slightly.</p>
   <p>Amduscias nodded and glanced at Bael. "How would you like to dispose of the human being?"</p>
   <p>Bael said nothing, but began to crawl purposefully toward Tracy, who drew back. Amduscias waved a deprecatory hand.</p>
   <p>"Very well. We're in disagreement. Shall we snatch the human being off to Hell and give him to Astoreth or Agaliarept? Or, perhaps, we could leave him here. There's no way out of this hinterland, except through Bael."</p>
   <p>Tracy tried to speak, and discovered that his throat was dry. "Hold on," he croaked. "I – I've got something to say about this, haven't I?"</p>
   <p>"Very little. Why?"</p>
   <p>"Well, I've no intention of being eaten."</p>
   <p>"Eaten! Why – Oh!" Amduscias looked at Belphegor's bared fangs and laughed softly. "We've no intention of eating you, I can say definitely. Demons can't eat. There's catabolism, but no metabolism. I wish human beings took a broader outlook toward the universe," he finished, with a little shrug.</p>
   <p>"I wish supernatural beings wouldn't talk so damn much," Tracy said, with a flash of irritation. "If you're going to kill me, go ahead and do it. I'm sick of this, anyway."</p>
   <p>Amduscias shook his head. "We can't decide on how to dispose of you, so I suppose – eh? – we'll just leave you here. After a while you'll starve. That all right, Belphegor? Bael?"</p>
   <p>It seemed to be all right. Belphegor and Bael vanished. Amduscias stood up, stretching. "I'll say good-by," he remarked. "No use your trying to escape. That door's locked for good. You can't get out through it. Farewell." He disappeared.</p>
   <p>Tracy waited for a while, but nothing further happened. He looked down at the book. It still said Page 12.</p>
   <p>"He's bluffing." About what? Who? Amduscias?</p>
   <p>The door?</p>
   <p>Tracy tried it again, but could not stir the knob, which seemed to have frozen motionless. He shoved the book back into his pocket and considered. What next?</p>
   <p>It was utterly silent. The ambiguous melting objects here and there on the plain did not move. Tracy walked toward the nearest and examined it. He could make nothing of the blobby outline.</p>
   <p>The horizon.</p>
   <p>He had a feeling that he was in the Looking Glass garden, and that if he walked far enough, he would suddenly find himself back where he had started. Shading his eyes under his palm, Tracy swept the unearthly landscape with a searching stare.</p>
   <p>Nothing.</p>
   <p>He was in danger, or else the book wouldn't have a page number on its cover. Again he referred to Page 12. Somebody was still bluffing. Amduscias, apparently. But bluffing about what?</p>
   <p>Why, Tracy wondered, hadn't the demons killed him? Their tactics reminded him of a war of nerves. They had wanted to destroy him – at least, Belphegor and Bael had; there was no doubt about that. Yet they had refrained.</p>
   <p>Maybe they couldn't kill him. They had taken the next best course, imprisoned him in this – this hinterland. What had Amduscias said at parting? "No use your trying to escape. That door's locked for good."</p>
   <p>Was Amduscias bluffing?</p>
   <p>The door loomed surrealistically in the distance. Tracy hurried back toward it and tried it again. The knob didn't move. He took out his pocketknife and tried to unscrew the lock, but couldn't. He succeeded only in breaking a blade. Some sort of stasis held the entire lock frozen motionless.</p>
   <p>He kicked the door, but it was solid as iron. Meanwhile, the book still said Page 12. And the book was never wrong.</p>
   <p>There had to be some way out. Tracy stood glaring at the door. He had walked out of the bathroom into this alien world. If he could only reopen the door, he could walk right back into that hotel bathroom. Or –</p>
   <p>"Oh, hell," Tracy said, and walked around to the other side of the door, turned the knob easily enough, and stepped back into the room where Barney Bonn, Tim Hatton, and the two other men were sitting around a table, cards in their hands.</p>
   <p>Donn nodded. "You weren't long," he said. "Ready to call me now?"</p>
   <p>Tracy hurriedly closed the door behind him. The book had not failed him, then. There were obviously two sides to every problem – and the demons had not expected Tracy to think of the logical solution. Or, rather, the illogical one.</p>
   <p>His experiences in the hinterland had not been measured by earthly time, either. Apparently he had left the room for only a minute or so. At least, the chips were in the pot, and Donn was holding his cards close to his chest, grinning encouragingly.</p>
   <p>"Come on," he said impatiently. "Let's get going."</p>
   <p>Tracy still held the book in one hand, and a glance at it, as he slid the volume in his pocket, told him that Page 12 was still trumps. He took a deep breath and sat down opposite Donn. Hell, he'd play the game to the limit now. He had no doubt at all but that Barney Donn, like Amduscias, was bluffing.</p>
   <p>"I'm raising," he said. "But you'll have to take a check."</p>
   <p>"Sure," Donn nodded. His eyes widened at sight of the amount. "Wait a minute, Tracy. This game's for cash. Checks are O.K. – if you've got the money to cover them."</p>
   <p>"I've got it," Tracy lied. "I'm in the chips, Barney. Didn't I tell you?"</p>
   <p>"Hm-m-m. It'll be unfortunate if you can't pay."</p>
   <p>Tracy said, "The hell with it," and took more of the blue chips. Hatton's eyes widened. This was big money.</p>
   <p>Donn raised.</p>
   <p>Tracy did the same.</p>
   <p>Donn said, "Mind taking my IOU?"</p>
   <p>"Not a bit."</p>
   <p>The stakes mounted till Hatton got dizzy. In the end, Tracy called and Donn laid down. The reporter had two kings and three queens. Donn had a royal flush – almost. He had drawn to fill the flush, but hadn't made it.</p>
   <p>He had been bluffing.</p>
   <p>Tracy said, "You're lucky at stud, Barney, but I guess draw poker's my game."</p>
   <p>Donn grinned. "I like excitement. Give me a pen, somebody." He wrote a check. "Money's easy for me to make. So I figure I have to pay out to make it come in. Here you are, Sam."</p>
   <p>"Thanks." Tracy took the check and collected his own scrip. He shook hands with Donn and led the dazed Hatton from the room.</p>
   <p>In the lobby the photographer woke up sufficiently to say, "Hey! I forgot to snap the pictures."</p>
   <p>"Let it wait," Tracy advised. "I want to get to the bank before it closes."</p>
   <p>"Yeah. I should think so. How much did you take Donn for?"</p>
   <p>"Not quite enough," Tracy said, scowling. The check was in five figures, but what the hell! Five figures, with the magic book in his possession, were peanuts. He had muffled a chance by aiming too low. And now there were only six chances left.</p>
   <p>Maybe only five! Those two crises might have counted individually. Damn again. If he used up all his chances, and Meg still survived, it would be just too bad. Somehow, he had to get rid of the familiar. But how?</p>
   <p>How could he maneuver her into a situation where the book would tell him how to destroy Meg? The enchanted volume told him only how to protect himself.</p>
   <p>Ergo – a situation where only Meg's destruction would save his own life. That was what was needed.</p>
   <p>"Just like that," Tracy grunted, his long strides carrying him toward the bank. Halfway there he changed his mind and hailed a taxi. "Sorry, Hatton. I thought of something important. See you later."</p>
   <p>"Sure." The photographer stood on the curb, looking after the cab. "What a man! Maybe he don't care about money – I dunno. I only wish I had my pink little paws on some of that dough!"</p>
   <p>Tracy went to his broker's office, asked astute questions, and watched the ticker. He was playing for high stakes, and was willing, now, to take somewhat more than a gambler's risk. He put his entire fortune on AGM Consolidated, though he had to argue briefly with the broker.</p>
   <p>"Mr. Tracy! AGM? It's – Look! Four points while we've been talking. The bottom's dropping out of it."</p>
   <p>"Buy it, please. All you can. On margin."</p>
   <p>"Margin? Mr. Tracy – Look, have you got some inside tip?"</p>
   <p>"Buy it, please."</p>
   <p>"But – look at that ticker!"</p>
   <p>"Go ahead and buy it."</p>
   <p>"Well, all right. It's your funeral."</p>
   <p>"Right," Tracy said, with every appearance of satisfaction. "It's my funeral. Looks like I'll be flat broke in a day or so."</p>
   <p>"I'll be asking you for more margin by morning."</p>
   <p>Tracy retired and watched AGM drop steadily. It was, as he well knew, one of the most worthless stocks in existence, and the bottom had dropped out of it only a day or so after the company's formation. He was on a toboggan rushing rapidly down to pauperism.</p>
   <p>He took the book from his pocket and stared at it. There was a new numeral on the cover. That meant a new crisis, which he himself had precipitated. Swell!</p>
   <p>Page 2 said: "A fortune in oil lies beneath your feet."</p>
   <p>Tracy's eyes widened. He looked down at the deep-napped claret carpet. Five stories down with the substrata of Los Angeles, oil? Here?</p>
   <p>Impossible. In the Kettleman Hills, out at San Pedro – anywhere but in the heart of downtown Los Angeles. There couldn't be oil in this ground. If, by any fantastic chance, there was, it was manifestly useless to Tracy. He couldn't buy the land and sink a well.</p>
   <p>But the book said, "A fortune in oil lies beneath your feet."</p>
   <p>Tracy stood up hesitantly. He nodded at the broker and went out to the elevator. A small bribe enabled him to visit the basement, which was of no help whatsoever. The janitor, in answer to guarded questions, said that the Hill Street subway ran under the building.</p>
   <p>Tracy came out and stood in the lobby, chewing his lip, conscious that his money was rapidly being dissipated in the worthless AGM Consolidated. The book couldn't be wrong. It gave the answer to every human problem.</p>
   <p>His eyes fell on the building directory. His broker's office was 501.</p>
   <p>"Beneath your feet." Oh – oh! The book might be very literal indeed. What was in Office 401?</p>
   <p>A photographic supply company – but 301 gave the right answer. Pan-Argyle Oil, Ltd.</p>
   <p>Tracy paused long enough to check 201 and 101, but his original guess had been accurate. He didn't wait for the elevator. He ran up the stairs and burst gasping into the broker's office.</p>
   <p>"Mr. Tracy!" the man greeted him. "I'm still buying, but this is crazy. You'd better get out while the getting's good."</p>
   <p>"I will – but tell me just one thing. Is Pan-Argyle Oil on the board?"</p>
   <p>"Uh – yes. Nothing bid, three asked. But that's as bad as AGM. Pan-Argyle's a cheap wildcat outfit –"</p>
   <p>"Never mind," Tracy snapped. "Sell AGM and buy all the Pan-Argyle you can get your hands on. Margin!"</p>
   <p>The broker threw up his hands and reached for the telephone. Tracy examined the book. The numeral was gone.</p>
   <p>And that left four chances. Maybe five – five at most. He'd play safe. Say, four chances to outwit Meg and get rid of her permanently. Then – if this oil deal worked out as he expected – he could sit back and relax.</p>
   <p>He headed for a bar and toasted himself silently. Then he toasted the book. A handy little volume! If Napoleon had possessed it, there'd never have been a Waterloo – provided the chances had been used wisely. The point was, apparently, to play for big stakes.</p>
   <p>Tracy grinned. The next step – Meg. As for security, what was he worrying about? With sufficient money, he'd have security enough. As much as any man could. The powers of the book were limited, obviously; they couldn't change a man into a god. Only the gods were completely happy – if, indeed, they were.</p>
   <p>But a fortune would be enough. Perhaps he'd go to South America – Buenos Aires, or Rio. Travel was restricted, in these days. Necessarily. Just the same, he could enjoy himself there, and there would be no difficulty with the law, in case his blackmailing proclivities were ever raked up. Extradition is difficult when a man has enough money.</p>
   <p>A shadow flashed past his eyes, and he turned in time to see the tail of a cat vanish out the door. He caught his breath and grinned. Nerves.</p>
   <p>But, unmistakably, the warmth of the book made itself felt against his side.</p>
   <p>Very slowly Tracy took it out.</p>
   <p>Page 44.</p>
   <p>"Poison?"</p>
   <p>Tracy looked thoughtfully at the whiskey sour before him. He beckoned to the bartender.</p>
   <p>"Yes, sir?"</p>
   <p>"Was there a cat in here a minute ago?"</p>
   <p>"A cat? I didn't see any – no, sir."</p>
   <p>A little man sitting near Tracy turned his head. "I saw it. It came over and jumped up on the bar. Sniffed at your drink, but it didn't touch it. Guess cats don't like whiskey." He giggled.</p>
   <p>"What sort of cat was it?" Tracy asked.</p>
   <p>The little man looked at him oddly. "Ordinary sort of cat. Big fella. White feet, looked like. What of it?"</p>
   <p>"Nothing." Tracy turned back to his drink and sniffed it. There was an unmistakable bitter-almonds odor. Prussic acid, the conventional poison.</p>
   <p>Tracy left the bar, his face rather white. Three chances. Perhaps he had miscalculated, after all. But ten, in the beginning, had seemed an abundance.</p>
   <p>There was no sign of Meg.</p>
   <p>He didn't bother to go back to the <emphasis>Journal</emphasis>, though he phoned to get a report on Pan-Argyle. He was not surprised to learn that a new field had suddenly been brought in somewhere in Texas. It looked big, plenty big. He had got in just under the wire.</p>
   <p>He phoned his broker, and the news was eminently satisfying. Buying on margin had its advantages. As a result, Tracy was already a rich man.</p>
   <p>"It may peter out, though," the broker said. "Shall I hang on?"</p>
   <p>"It won't peter out." Tracy's voice was confident. "Keep buying, if there's any stock left floating around."</p>
   <p>"There isn't. But you've got almost a controlling share."</p>
   <p>"Good." Tracy hung up and considered. He'd have to move fast now.</p>
   <p>Three chances.</p>
   <p>He cheered himself up by buying a car from an acquaintance who had been pressed for money lately; and presently was tooling the big sedan along Wilshire Boulevard, squinting against the sunset. The next step was to find Meg and maneuver himself into a very dangerous position, where only the familiar's destruction could save him.</p>
   <p>Quite suddenly Tracy saw the way.</p>
   <p>It would take two chances, but that would still leave one for emergencies. And it would get rid of Meg permanently.</p>
   <p>He turned on La Brea and headed for Laurel Canyon. It was necessary to get in touch with the familiar. Under the circumstances, time counted. No more of the irreplaceable pages must be used up now. Not until the final test.</p>
   <p>Tracy grinned sardonically. He had had ten chances; the result was money. Well, the aphorism about spilt milk was consoling, after a fashion. He swung into Sunset, and thence to Laurel Canyon Road.</p>
   <p>After that he went cautiously. He was hoping that Gwinn's body had not yet been discovered, and that he could get in contact with Meg at the magician's house. It was a slim chance, but he could think of no other.</p>
   <p>Luck was with him. The house loomed dark and silent. Letters stuck out of the metal mailbox at the curb. The rising wind caught one and fluttered it away into the twilight.</p>
   <p>Instinctively Tracy's eyes sought the cat, but it was nowhere in evidence. He parked the sedan in the roadway behind the house, hidden by dwarf trees and underbrush. Then he went back and climbed the steps, his heart beating faster than normal.</p>
   <p>The door was closed but unlocked. He pushed it open and entered.</p>
   <p>The room was slightly changed. A pentagram was traced on the floor, and the remnants of several oil lamps were broken shards. Oil had soaked into the carpet, and the smell was strong in Tracy's nostrils. The body of Gwinn sat motionless behind the table.</p>
   <p>"Meg!" Tracy said softly.</p>
   <p>The cat came out of the shadows, green eyes gleaming.</p>
   <p>"Yes?"</p>
   <p>"I – I wanted to talk to you."</p>
   <p>Meg sat down, waving her tail. "Talk away. But you have used seven pages of the book already, you know."</p>
   <p>"Then Barney Donn and the demons counted separately."</p>
   <p>"Yes. You have three pages left."</p>
   <p>Tracy said, standing motionless in the twilit room, horribly conscious of Gwinn's corpse:</p>
   <p>"Will you take a sporting chance?"</p>
   <p>"Perhaps. What is it?"</p>
   <p>"I'll gamble with you. My life as the stake. If I win, you – call it off. If I lose, I'll destroy the book."</p>
   <p>Meg waved her tail. "I'm no fool. If we gamble, and you're in danger, the book will help you."</p>
   <p>"Then I won't use it," Tracy said, his voice a little unsteady. "Here's the proposition. We'll guess at a card's suit. Two guesses each. If I lose, I – I'll destroy the book. Only I make one stipulation."</p>
   <p>"What?"</p>
   <p>"I want twelve hours to set my affairs in order. Twelve hours from now, if I lose, I'll throw the book in the fire at my apartment and wait for you."</p>
   <p>Meg looked at the man inscrutably. "And you won't use the book to help you win?"</p>
   <p>"Right."</p>
   <p>"I agree," the cat said. "You'll find cards on that shelf." It waved a white-mittened paw.</p>
   <p>Tracy got the cards and shuffled them expertly. He spread them out on the carpet and looked at Meg. "Will you draw? Or shall I?"</p>
   <p>"Draw," the familiar murmured. Tracy obeyed, but did not turn the card over. He laid it face down on the oil-soaked carpet.</p>
   <p>"I choose –"</p>
   <p>His side felt warm. Instinctively he drew out the book. On the front cover two numerals were black against the luminous white disk:</p>
   <p>33</p>
   <p>"Don't open it," Meg said, "or the deal's off."</p>
   <p>For answer, Tracy placed the book at his side, unopened. His voice shaking, he whispered, "Hearts and spades."</p>
   <p>"All right." The cat flipped the card over with a deft paw. It was the jack of clubs.</p>
   <p>The numeral on the book's cover vanished abruptly.</p>
   <p>Meg flicked out a lazy pink tongue. "Twelve hours, then, Tracy. I'll be waiting as patiently as possible."</p>
   <p>"Yeah." Tracy was looking at the book on the floor beside him. "Twelve hours," he repeated softly. "Then I'll destroy – this and you'll kill me, I suppose."</p>
   <p>"Yes," the cat said.</p>
   <p>A new numeral appeared in the white oval: 9. Tracy said, "I'll be getting on," and picked up the book. He thumbed it idly.</p>
   <p>Page 9 said, "Start a fire."</p>
   <p>Tracy took out a cigarette and lit it. The flaming match he tossed down to the oil-soaked carpet. And –</p>
   <p>Fire blazed up, reflecting crimson and green in Meg's eyes as she bounded up, hissing. The feline side was in the ascendant now. Tail erect, back arched, she leaped to the table, spitting and snarling.</p>
   <p>Tracy jumped back to the door. The fire was spreading. He slid the book into his pocket and tossed the cigarette into a dark corner of the room. The red spark flashed out into flame.</p>
   <p>"Like it, Meg?" he whispered above the increasing crackle and roar. "I don't think you do. Because it's the only thing that'll save my life – and I'm pretty sure that means your death."</p>
   <p>The cat sprang to Gwinn's shoulder, glaring at Tracy. Its hissing became articulate. "Not my death – but you've won! My term on earth ends when my warlock's body is destroyed. I won't survive him."</p>
   <p>"I remember. You told me that once before, but I didn't guess the right answer. Sorry, Meg!"</p>
   <p>"My powers are waning already, or you'd die now. Yes, you've won. I'll see you in Hell."</p>
   <p>"Not for a while," Tracy grinned, opening the door. The draft drew a gust of flames toward him, and he backed off hurriedly. "I still have one page in the book left, and that'll keep me alive for a while – especially with you out of the way, and a fortune at my finger tips. It's just a matter of logic, Meg. Every human action can be boiled down to a basic equation" – he jumped back again – "and the only trick is to learn how to use the book. If Napoleon had owned it, he'd have conquered the world."</p>
   <p>Fire was crawling toward the cat, yet she did not move from Gwinn's shoulder. She spat at Tracy. "Napoleon did own it," she snarled. Then the flames drove Tracy out of the house. Laughing quietly, he raced down the steps and around to where he had left his car. He had won – tricked both Meg and the book neatly by maneuvering himself into a position where only the familiar's death would save his own life. And there was still one page left.</p>
   <p>A window crackled and broke. Fire poured out from it. Instantly the dry brush caught. Tracy stopped short, a dozen feet from his car. He gave back, realizing instantly that this way of escape was blocked.</p>
   <p>It didn't matter. He was invulnerable, as long as he had the book – as long as there was one chance left. He turned and ran for the road, wind gusting coldly against his sweating cheeks.</p>
   <p>It was, perhaps, a mile down to Laurel Canyon, where he could get a lift. But it was all downhill, and he was in good condition. Even though the wind was rising, he could make it easily. And, at worst, the book would save him.</p>
   <p>So Tracy ran down the road, until, ten minutes later, he stopped at sight of a trail of flame rushing down a gully in his path.</p>
   <p>He took the first branch that forked, and cut down into another canyon. It was past sunset now, but the hills had become crawling towers of scarlet light. A siren screamed in the distance.</p>
   <p>Tracy went on. Once he took out the book and looked at it, but there were no numerals on the cover. He wasn't in serious danger yet.</p>
   <p>A thought of panic struck cold into his mind. Perhaps he had, somehow, used up the ten chances! But no – that was impossible. He had kept careful count. When an emergency arose, the book would save him.</p>
   <p>The increasing fury of the brush fire drove Tracy down the canyon, until at last he was halted by another comb of flames racing up toward him. He was – apparently – trapped. Standing hatless and panting, he jerked out the book again, and this time a tiny moan of relief escaped him. There was no mistake; the tenth chance lay in his hand, ready to solve his problem. Page 50.</p>
   <p>Tracy opened the book to Page 50. It was easy to read the message, in the bloody light of the fire. It was rather horribly easy to read the message; its clarity had a touch of inhuman malice about it. Tracy understood then, of course, about Napoleon, and about what Gwinn had seen in the book before his death; and he also realized how the unknown author had managed to boil all human crises down to fifty patterns. Forty-nine of them covered forty-nine eventualities, and told the logical solution. The fiftieth covered everything else, and was equally logical.</p>
   <p>The letters on the fire-reddened fiftieth page said:</p>

    <p>WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>They were surprised at getting the apartment, what with high rents and written-in clauses in the lease, and Joe Calderon felt himself lucky to be only ten minutes subway ride from the University. His wife, Myra, fluffed up her red hair in a distracted fashion and said that landlords presumably expected parthenogenesis in their tenants, if that was what she meant. Anyhow, it was where an organism split in two and the result was two mature specimens. Calderon grinned, said, "Binary fission, chump," and watched young Alexander, aged eighteen months, backing up on all fours across the carpet, preparatory to assuming a standing position on his fat bowlegs.</p>
   <p>It was a pleasant apartment, at that. The sun came into it at times, and there were more rooms than they had any right to expect, for the price. The next-door neighbor, a billowy blonde who talked of little except her migraine, said that it was hard to keep tenants in 4-D. It wasn't exactly haunted, but it had the queerest visitors. The last lessee, an insurance man who drank heavily, moved out one day talking about little men who came ringing the bell at all hours asking for a Mr. Pott, or somebody like that. Not until some time later did Joe identify Pott with Cauldron – or Calderon.</p>
   <p>They were sitting on the couch in a pleased manner, looking at Alexander. He was quite a baby. Like all infants, he had a collar of fat at the back of his neck, and his legs, Calderon said, were like two vast and trunkless limbs of stone – at least they gave that effect. The eyes stopped at their incredible bulging pinkness, fascinated. Alexander laughed like a fool, rose to his feet, and staggered drunkenly toward his parents, muttering unintelligible gibberish. "Madman," Myra said fondly, and tossed the child a floppy velvet pig of whom he was enamored.</p>
   <p>"So we're all set for the winter," Calderon said. He was a tall, thin, harassed-looking man, a fine research physicist, and very much interested in his work at the University. Myra was a rather fragile red-head, with a tilted nose and sardonic red-brown eyes. She made deprecatory noises.</p>
   <p>"If we can get a maid. Otherwise I'll char."</p>
   <p>"You sound like a lost soul," Calderon said. "What do you mean, you'll char?"</p>
   <p>"Like a charwoman. Sweep, cook, clean. Babies are a great trial. Still, they're worth it."</p>
   <p>"Not in front of Alexander. He'll get above himself."</p>
   <p>The doorbell rang. Calderon uncoiled himself, wandered vaguely across the room, and opened the door. He blinked at nothing. Then he lowered his gaze somewhat, and what he saw was sufficient to make him stare a little.</p>
   <p>Four tiny men were standing in the hall. That is, they were tiny below the brows. Their craniums were immense, watermelon large and watermelon shaped, or else they were wearing abnormally huge helmets of glistening metal. Their faces were wizened, peaked tiny masks that were nests of lines and wrinkles. Their clothes were garish, unpleasantly colored, and seemed to be made of paper.</p>
   <p>"Oh?" Calderon said blankly.</p>
   <p>Swift looks were exchanged among the four. One of them said, "Are you Joseph Calderon?"</p>
   <p>"Yeah."</p>
   <p>"We," said the most wrinkled of the quartet, "are your son's descendents. He's a super child. We're here to educate him."</p>
   <p>"Yes," Calderon said. "Yes, of course. I ... <emphasis>listen</emphasis>!"</p>
   <p>"To what?"</p>
   <p>"Super –"</p>
   <p>"There he is," another dwarf cried. "It's Alexander! We've hit the right time at last!" He scuttled past Calderon's legs and into the room. Calderon made a few futile snatches, but the small men easily evaded him. When he turned, they were gathered around Alexander. Myra had drawn up her legs under her and was watching with an amazed expression.</p>
   <p>"Look at that," a dwarf said. "See his potential tefeetzie?" It sounded like tefeetzie.</p>
   <p>"But his skull, Bordent," another put in. "That's the important part. The vyrings are almost perfectly coblastably."</p>
   <p>"Beautiful," Bordent acknowledged. He leaned forward. Alexander reached forward into the nest of wrinkles, seized Bordent's nose, and twisted painfully. Bordent bore it stoically until the grip relaxed.</p>
   <p>"Undeveloped," he said tolerantly. "We'll develop him."</p>
   <p>Myra sprang from the couch, picked up her child, and stood at bay, facing the little men. "Joe," she said, "are you going to stand for this? Who are these bad-mannered goblins?"</p>
   <p>"Lord knows," Calderon said. He moistened his lips. "What kind of a gag is that? Who sent you?"</p>
   <p>"Alexander," Bordent said. "From the year ... ah ... about 2450, reckoning roughly. He's practically immortal. Only violence can kill one of the Supers, and there's none of that in 2450."</p>
   <p>Calderon sighed. "No, I mean it. A gag's a gag. But –"</p>
   <p>"Time and again we've tried. In 1940, 1944, 1947 – all around this era. We were either too early or too late. But now we've hit on the right time-sector. It's our job to educate Alexander. You should feel proud of being his parents. We worship you, you know. Father and mother of the new race."</p>
   <p>"Tuh!" Calderon said. "Come off it!"</p>
   <p>"They need proof, Dobish," someone said. "Remember, this is their first inkling that Alexander is homo superior."</p>
   <p>"Homo nuts," Myra said. "Alexander's a perfectly normal baby."</p>
   <p>"He's perfectly supernormal," Dobish said. "We're his descendents."</p>
   <p>"That makes you a superman," Calderon said skeptically, eyeing the small man.</p>
   <p>"Not in toto. There aren't many of the X Free type. The biological norm is specialization. Only a few are straight-line super. Some specialize in logic, others in vervainity, others – like us – are guides. If we were X Free supers, you couldn't stand there and talk to us. Or look at us. We're only parts. Those like Alexander are the glorious whole."</p>
   <p>"Oh, send them away," Myra said, getting tired of it. "I feel like a Thurber woman."</p>
   <p>Calderon nodded. "O.K. Blow, gentlemen. Take a powder. I mean it."</p>
   <p>"Yes," Dobish said, "they need proof. What'll we do? Skyskinate?"</p>
   <p>"Too twisty," Bordent objected. "Object lesson, eh? The stiller."</p>
   <p>"Stiller?" Myra asked.</p>
   <p>Bordent took an object from his paper clothes and spun it in his hands. His fingers were all double-jointed. Calderon felt a tiny electric shock go through him.</p>
   <p>"Joe," Myra said, white-faced. "I can't move."</p>
   <p>"Neither can I. Take it easy. This is ... it's –" He slowed and stopped.</p>
   <p>"Sit down," Bordent said, still twirling the object. Calderon and Myra backed up to the couch and sat down. Their tongues froze with the rest of them.</p>
   <p>Dobish came over, clambered up, and pried Alexander out of his mother's grip. Horror moved in her eyes.</p>
   <p>"We won't hurt him," Dobish said. "We just want to give him his first lesson. Have you got the basics, Finn?"</p>
   <p>"In the bag." Finn extracted a foot-long bag from his garments. Things came out of that bag. They came out incredibly. Soon the carpet was littered with stuff – problematical in design, nature, and use. Calderon recognized a tesseract.</p>
   <p>The fourth dwarf, whose name, it turned out, was Quat, smiled consolingly at the distressed parents. "You watch. You can't learn; you've not got the potential. You're homo saps. But Alexander, now –"</p>
   <p>Alexander was in one of his moods. He was diabolically gay. With the devil-possession of all babies, he refused to collaborate. He crept rapidly backwards. He burst into loud, squalling sobs. He regarded his feet with amazed joy.</p>
   <p>He stuffed his fist into his mouth and cried bitterly at the result. He talked about invisible things in a soft, cryptic monotone. He punched Dobish in the eye.</p>
   <p>The little men had inexhaustible patience. Two hours later they were through. Calderon couldn't see that Alexander had learned much.</p>
   <p>Bordent twirled the object again. He nodded affably, and led the retreat. The four little men went out of the apartment, and a moment later Calderon and Myra could move.</p>
   <p>She jumped up, staggering on numbed legs, seized Alexander, and collapsed on the couch. Calderon rushed to the door and flung it open. The hall was empty.</p>
   <p>"Joe –" Myra said, her voice small and afraid. Calderon came back and smoothed her hair. He looked down at the bright fuzzy head of Alexander.</p>
   <p>"Joe. We've got to do – do something."</p>
   <p>"I don't know," he said. "If it happened –"</p>
   <p>"It happened. They took those things with them. Alexander. Oh!"</p>
   <p>"They didn't try to hurt him," Calderon said hesitatingly.</p>
   <p>"Our <emphasis>baby</emphasis>! He's no superchild."</p>
   <p>"Well," Calderon said, "I'll get out my revolver. What else can I do?"</p>
   <p>"I'll do something," Myra promised. "Nasty little goblins! I'll do something, just wait."</p>
   <p>And yet there wasn't a great deal they could do.</p>
   <p>Tacitly they ignored the subject the next day. But at 4 P.M., the same time as the original visitation, they were with Alexander in a theater, watching the latest Technicolor film. The four little men could scarcely find them here –</p>
   <p>Calderon felt Myra stiffen, and even as he turned, he suspected the worst. Myra sprang up, her breath catching. Her fingers tightened on his arm.</p>
   <p>"He's gone!"</p>
   <p>"G-gone?"</p>
   <p>"He just vanished. I was holding him ... let's get out of here."</p>
   <p>"Maybe you dropped him," Calderon said inanely, and lit a match. There were cries from behind. Myra was already pushing her way toward the aisle. There were no babies under the seat, and Calderon caught up with his wife in the lobby.</p>
   <p>"He disappeared," Myra was babbling. "Like that. Maybe he's in the future. Joe, what'll we do?"</p>
   <p>Calderon, through some miracle, got a taxi. "We'll go home. That's the most likely place. I hope."</p>
   <p>"Yes. Of course it is. Give me a cigarette."</p>
   <p>"He'll be in the apartment –"</p>
   <p>He was, squatting on his haunches, taking a decided interest in the gadget Quat was demonstrating. The gadget was a gayly-colored egg beater with four-dimensional attachments, and it talked in a thin, high voice. Not in English.</p>
   <p>Bordent flipped out the stiller and began to twirl it as the couple came in. Calderon got hold of Myra's arms and held her back, "Hold on," he said urgently. "That isn't necessary. We won't try anything."</p>
   <p>"Joe!" Myra tried to wriggle free. "Are you going to let them –"</p>
   <p>"Quiet!" he said. "Bordent, put that thing down. We want to talk to you."</p>
   <p>"Well – if you promise not to interrupt –"</p>
   <p>"We promise." Calderon forcibly led Myra to the couch and held her there. "Look, darling. Alexander's all right. They're not hurting him."</p>
   <p>"Hurt him, indeed!" Finn said. "He'd skin us alive in the future if we hurt him in the past."</p>
   <p>"Be quiet," Bordent commanded. He seemed to be the leader of the four. "I'm glad you're co-operating, Joseph Calderon. It goes against my grain to use force on a demigod. After all, you're <emphasis>Alexander's</emphasis> father."</p>
   <p>Alexander put out a fat paw and tried to touch the whirling rainbow egg beater. He seemed to be fascinated. Quat said, "The kivelish is sparking. Shall I vastinate?"</p>
   <p>"Not too fast," Bordent said. "He'll be rational in a week, and then we can speed up the process. Now, Calderon, please relax. Anything you want?"</p>
   <p>"A drink."</p>
   <p>"They mean alcohol," Finn said. "The Rubaiyat mentions it, remember?"</p>
   <p>"Rubaiyat?"</p>
   <p>"The singing red gem in Twelve Library."</p>
   <p>"Oh, yes," Bordent said. "That one. I was thinking of the Yahveh slab, the one with the thunder effects. Do you want to make some alcohol, Finn?"</p>
   <p>Calderon swallowed. "Don't bother. I have some in that sideboard. May I –"</p>
   <p>"You're not <emphasis>prisoners</emphasis>." Bordent's voice was shocked. "It's just that we've got to make you listen to a few explanations, and after that – well, it'll be different."</p>
   <p>Myra shook her head when Calderon handed her a drink, but he scowled at her meaningly. "You won't feel it. Go ahead."</p>
   <p>She hadn't once taken her gaze from Alexander. The baby was imitating the thin noise of the egg beater now. It was subtly unpleasant.</p>
   <p>"The ray is working," Quat said. "The viewer shows some slight cortical resistance, though."</p>
   <p>"Angle the power," Bordent told him.</p>
   <p>Alexander said, "Modjewabba?"</p>
   <p>"What's that?" Myra asked in a strained voice. "Super language?"</p>
   <p>Bordent smiled at her. "No, just baby talk."</p>
   <p>Alexander burst into sobs. Myra said, "Super baby or not, when he cries like that, there's a good reason. Does your tutoring extend to that point?"</p>
   <p>"Certainly," Quat said calmly. He and Finn carried Alexander out. Bordent smiled again.</p>
   <p>"You're beginning to believe," he said. "That helps." Calderon drank, feeling the hot fumes of whiskey along the backs of his cheeks. His stomach was crawling with cold uneasiness.</p>
   <p>"If you were human –" he said doubtfully.</p>
   <p>"If we were, we wouldn't be here. The old order changeth. It had to start sometime. Alexander is the first homo superior."</p>
   <p>"But why us?" Myra asked.</p>
   <p>"Genetics. You've both worked with radioactivity and certain short-wave radiations that effected the germ plasm. The mutation just happened. It'll happen again from now on. But you happen to be the first. You'll die, but Alexander will live on. Perhaps a thousand years."</p>
   <p>Calderon said, "This business of coming from the future ... you say Alexander sent you?"</p>
   <p>"The adult Alexander. The mature superman. It's a different culture, of course – beyond your comprehension. Alexander is one of the X Frees. He said to me, through the interpreting-machine, of course, 'Bordent, I wasn't recognized as a super till I was thirty years old. I had only ordinary homo sap development till then. I didn't know my potential myself. And that's bad.' It <emphasis>is</emphasis> bad, you know," Bordent digressed. "The full capabilities of an organism can't emerge unless it's given the fullest chance of expansion from birth on. Or at least from infancy. Alexander said to me, 'It's about five hundred years ago that I was born. Take a few guides and go into the past. Locate me as an infant. Give me specialized training, from the beginning. I think it'll expand me.'"</p>
   <p>"The past," Calderon said. "You mean it's plastic?"</p>
   <p>"Well, it affects the future. You can't alter the past without altering the future, too. But things tend to drift back. There's a temporal norm, a general level. In the original time sector, Alexander wasn't visited by us. Now that's changed. So the future will be changed. But not tremendously. No crucial temporal apexes are involved, no keystones. The only result will be that the mature Alexander will have his potential more fully realized."</p>
   <p>Alexander was carried back into the room, beaming. Quat resumed his lesson with the egg beater.</p>
   <p>"There isn't a great deal you can do about it," Bordent said. "I think you realize that now."</p>
   <p>Myra said, "Is Alexander going to look like you?" Her face was strained.</p>
   <p>"Oh, no. He's a perfect physical specimen. I've never seen him, of course, but –"</p>
   <p>Calderon said, "Heir to all the ages. Myra, are you beginning to get the idea?"</p>
   <p>"Yes. A superman. But he's our baby."</p>
   <p>"He'll remain so," Bordent put in anxiously. "We don't want to remove him from the beneficial home and parental influence. An infant needs that. In fact, tolerance for the young is an evolutionary trait aimed at providing for the superman's appearance, just as the vanishing appendix is such a preparation. At certain eras of history mankind is receptive to the preparation of the new race. It's never been quite successful before – there were anthropological miscarriages, so to speak. My squeevers, it's <emphasis>important</emphasis>! Infants are awfully irritating. They're helpless for a very long time, a great trial to the patience of the parents – the lower the order of the animal, the faster the infant develops. With mankind, it takes years for the young to reach an independent state. So the parental tolerance increases in proportion. The superchild won't mature, actually, till he's about twenty."</p>
   <p>Myra said, "Alexander will still be a baby then?"</p>
   <p>"He'll have the physical standards of an eight-year-old specimen of homo sap. Mentally ... well, call it irrationality. He won't be leveled out to an intellectual or emotional norm. He won't be sane, any more than any baby is. Selectivity takes quite a while to develop. But his peaks will be far, far above the peaks of, say, you as a child."</p>
   <p>"Thanks," Calderon said.</p>
   <p>"His horizons will be broader. His mind is capable of grasping and assimilating far more than yours. The world is really his oyster. He won't be limited. But it'll take a while for his mind, his personality, to shake down."</p>
   <p>"I want another drink," Myra said.</p>
   <p>Calderon got it. Alexander inserted his thumb in Quat's eye and tried to gouge it out. Quat submitted passively.</p>
   <p>"Alexander!" Myra said.</p>
   <p>"Sit still," Bordent said. "Quat's tolerance in this regard is naturally higher developed than yours."</p>
   <p>"If he puts Quat's eye out," Calderon said, "it'll be just too bad."</p>
   <p>"Quat isn't important, compared to Alexander. He knows it, too."</p>
   <p>Luckily for Quat's binocular vision, Alexander suddenly tired of his new toy and fell to staring at the egg beater again. Dobish and Finn leaned over the baby and looked at him. But there was more to it than that, Calderon felt.</p>
   <p>"Induced telepathy," Bordent said. "It takes a long time to develop, but we're starting now. I tell you, it was a relief to hit the right time at last. I've rung this doorbell at least a hundred times. But never till now –"</p>
   <p>"Move," Alexander said clearly. "Real. Move."</p>
   <p>Bordent nodded. "Enough for today. We'll be here again tomorrow. You'll be ready?"</p>
   <p>"As ready," Myra said, "as we'll ever be, I suppose." She finished her drink.</p>
   <p>They got fairly high that night and talked it over. Their arguments were biased by their realization of the four little men's obvious resources. Neither doubted any more. They knew that Bordent and his companions had come from five hundred years in the future, at the command of a future Alexander who had matured into a fine specimen of superman.</p>
   <p>"Amazing, isn't it?" Myra said. "That fat little blob in the bedroom turning into a twelfth-power Quiz Kid."</p>
   <p>"Well, it's got to start somewhere. As Bordent pointed out."</p>
   <p>"And as long as he isn't going to look like those goblins – ugh!"</p>
   <p>"He'll be super. Deucalion and what's-her-name – that's us. Parents of a new race."</p>
   <p>"I feel funny," Myra said. "As though I'd given birth to a moose."</p>
   <p>"That could never happen," Calderon said consolingly. "Have another slug."</p>
   <p>"It might as well have happened. Alexander is a swoose."</p>
   <p>"Swoose?"</p>
   <p>"I can use that goblin's doubletalk, too. Vopishly woggle in the grand foyer. So there."</p>
   <p>"It's a language to them," Calderon said.</p>
   <p>"Alexander's going to talk English. I've got my rights." "Well, Bordent doesn't seem anxious to infringe on them. He said Alexander needed a home environment."</p>
   <p>"That's the only reason I haven't gone crazy," Myra said. "As long as he ... they ... don't take our baby away from us –"</p>
   <p>A week later it was thoroughly clear that Bordent had no intention of encroaching on parental rights – at least, any more than was necessary, for two hours a day. During that period the four little men fulfilled their orders by cramming Alexander with all the knowledge his infantile but super brain could hold. They did not depend on blocks or nursery rhymes or the abacus. Their weapons in the battle were cryptic, futuristic, but effective. And they taught Alexander, there was no doubt of that. As B-1 poured on a plant's roots forces growth, so the vitamin teaching of the dwarfs soaked into Alexander, and his potentially superhuman brain responded, expanding with brilliant, erratic speed.</p>
   <p>He had talked intelligibly on the fourth day. On the seventh day he was easily able to hold conversations, though his baby muscles, lingually undeveloped, tired easily. His cheeks were still sucking-disks; he was not yet fully human, except in sporadic flashes. Yet those flashes came oftener now, and closer together.</p>
   <p>The carpet was a mess. The little men no longer took their equipment back with them; they left it for Alexander to use. The infant crept – he no longer bothered to walk much, for he could crawl with more efficiency – among the Objects, selected some of them, and put them together. Myra had gone out to shop. The little men wouldn't show up for half an hour. Calderon, tired from his day's work at the University, fingered a highball and looked at his offspring.</p>
   <p>"Alexander," he said.</p>
   <p>Alexander didn't answer. He fitted a gadget to a Thing, inserted it peculiarly in a Something Else, and sat back with an air of satisfaction. Then – "Yes?" he said. It wasn't perfect pronunciation, but it was unmistakable. Alexander talked somewhat like a toothless old man.</p>
   <p>"What are you doing?" Calderon said.</p>
   <p>"No."</p>
   <p>"What's that?"</p>
   <p>"No."</p>
   <p>"No?"</p>
   <p>"I understand it," Alexander said. "That's enough."</p>
   <p>"I see." Calderon regarded the prodigy with faint apprehension. "You don't want to tell me."</p>
   <p>"No."</p>
   <p>"Well, all right."</p>
   <p>"Get me a drink," Alexander said. For a moment Calderon had a mad idea that the infant was demanding a highball. Then he sighed, rose, and returned with a bottle.</p>
   <p>"Milk," Alexander said, refusing the potation.</p>
   <p>"You said a drink. Water's a drink, isn't it?" My God, Calderon thought, I'm arguing with the kid. I'm treating him like ... like an adult. But he isn't. He's a fat little baby squatting on his behind on the carpet, playing with a tinkertoy.</p>
   <p>The tinkertoy said something in a thin voice. Alexander murmured, "Repeat." The tinkertoy did.</p>
   <p>Calderon said, "What was that?"</p>
   <p>"No."</p>
   <p>"Nuts." Calderon went out to the kitchen and got milk. He poured himself another shot. This was like having relatives drop in suddenly – relatives you hadn't seen for ten years. How the devil did you act with a superchild?</p>
   <p>He stayed in the kitchen, after supplying Alexander with his milk. Presently Myra's key turned in the outer door. Her cry brought Calderon hurrying.</p>
   <p>Alexander was vomiting, with the air of a research man absorbed in a fascinating phenomenon.</p>
   <p>"Alexander!" Myra cried. "Darling, are you sick?"</p>
   <p>"No," Alexander said. "I'm testing my regurgitative processes. I must learn to control my digestive organs."</p>
   <p>Calderon leaned against the door, grinning crookedly. "Yeah. You'd better start now, too."</p>
   <p>"I'm finished," Alexander said. "Clean it up."</p>
   <p>Three days later the infant decided that his lungs needed developing. He cried. He cried at all hours, with interesting variations – whoops, squalls, wails, and high-pitched bellows. Nor would he stop till he was satisfied. The neighbors complained. Myra said, "Darling, is there a pin sticking you? Let me look –"</p>
   <p>"Go away," Alexander said. "You're too warm. Open the window. I want fresh air."</p>
   <p>"Yes, d-darling. Of course." She came back to bed and Calderon put his arm around her. He knew there would be shadows under her eyes in the morning. In his crib Alexander cried on.</p>
   <p>So it went. The four little men came daily and gave Alexander his lessons. They were pleased with the infant's progress. They did not complain when Alexander indulged in his idiosyncrasies, such as batting them heavily on the nose or ripping their paper garments to shreds. Bordent tapped his metal helmet and smiled triumphantly at Calderon.</p>
   <p>"He's coming along. He's developing."</p>
   <p>"I'm wondering. What about discipline?"</p>
   <p>Alexander looked up from his rapport with Quat. "Homo sap discipline doesn't apply to me, Joseph Calderon."</p>
   <p>"Don't call me Joseph Calderon. I'm your father, after all."</p>
   <p>"A primitive biological necessity. You are sufficiently well developed to provide the discipline I require. Your purpose is to give me parental care."</p>
   <p>"Which makes me an incubator," Calderon said.</p>
   <p>"But a deified one," Bordent soothed him. "Practically a logos. The father of the new race."</p>
   <p>"I feel more like Prometheus," the father of the new race said dourly. "He was helpful, too. And he ended up with a vulture eating his liver."</p>
   <p>"You will learn a great deal from Alexander."</p>
   <p>"He says I'm incapable of understanding it."</p>
   <p>"Well, aren't you?"</p>
   <p>"Sure. I'm just the papa bird," Calderon said, and subsided into a sad silence, watching Alexander, under Quat's tutelary eye, put together a gadget of shimmering glass and twisted metal. Bordent said suddenly. "Quat! Be careful of the egg!" And Finn seized a bluish ovoid just before Alexander's chubby hand could grasp it.</p>
   <p>"It isn't dangerous," Quat said. "It isn't connected."</p>
   <p>"He might have connected it."</p>
   <p>"I want that," Alexander said. "Give it to me."</p>
   <p>"Not yet, Alexander," Bordent refused. "You must learn the correct way of connecting it first. Otherwise it might harm you."</p>
   <p>"I could do it."</p>
   <p>"You are not logical enough to balance your capabilities and lacks as yet. Later it will be safe. I think now, perhaps, a little philosophy, Dobish – eh?"</p>
   <p>Dobish squatted and went en rapport with Alexander. Myra came out of the kitchen, took a quick look at the tableau, and retreated. Calderon followed her out.</p>
   <p>"I will never get used to it if I live a thousand years," she said with slow emphasis, hacking at the doughy rim of a pie. "He's my baby only when he's asleep."</p>
   <p>"We won't live a thousand years," Calderon told her. "Alexander will, though. I wish we could get a maid."</p>
   <p>"I tried again today," Myra said wearily. "No use. They're, all in war plants. I mention a baby –"</p>
   <p>"You can't do all this alone."</p>
   <p>"You help," she said, "when you can. But you're working hard too, fella. It won't be forever."</p>
   <p>"I wonder if we had another baby ... if –"</p>
   <p>Her sober gaze met his. "I've wondered that, too. But I should think mutations aren't as cheap as that. Once in a lifetime. Still, we don't know."</p>
   <p>"Well, it doesn't matter now, anyway. One infant's enough for the moment."</p>
   <p>Myra glanced toward the door. "Everything all right in there? Take a look. I worry."</p>
   <p>"It's all right."</p>
   <p>"I know, but that blue egg – Bordent said it was dangerous, you know. I heard him."</p>
   <p>Calderon peeped through the door-crack. The four dwarfs were sitting facing Alexander, whose eyes were closed. Now they opened. The infant scowled at Calderon.</p>
   <p>"Stay out," he requested. "You're breaking the rapport."</p>
   <p>"I'm so sorry," Calderon said, retreating. "He's O.K., Myra. His own dictatorial little self."</p>
   <p>"Well, he is a superman," she said doubtfully.</p>
   <p>"No. He's a super-baby. There's all the difference."</p>
   <p>"His latest trick," Myra said, busy with the oven, "is riddles. Or something like riddles. I feel so small when he catches me up. But he says it's good for his ego. It compensates for his physical frailness."</p>
   <p>"Riddles, eh? I know a few too."</p>
   <p>"They won't work on Alexander," Myra said, with grim assurance.</p>
   <p>Nor did they. "What goes up a chimney up?" was treated with the contempt it deserved; Alexander examined his father's riddles, turned them over in his logical mind, analyzed them for flaws in semantics and logic, and rejected them. Or else he answered them, with such fine accuracy that Calderon was too embarrassed to give the correct answers. He was reduced to asking why a raven was like a writing desk, and since not even the Mad Hatter had been able to answer his own riddle, was slightly terrified to find himself listening to a dissertation on comparative ornithology. After that, he let Alexander needle him with infantile gags about the relations of gamma rays to photons, and tried to be philosophical. There are few things as irritating as a child's riddles. His mocking triumph pulverizes itself into the dust in which you grovel.</p>
   <p>"Oh, leave your father alone," Myra said, coming in with her hair disarranged. "He's trying to read the paper."</p>
   <p>"That news is unimportant."</p>
   <p>"I'm reading the comics," Calderon said. "I want to see if the Katzenjammers get even with the Captain for hanging them under a waterfall."</p>
   <p>"The formula for the humor of an incongruity predicament," Alexander began learnedly, but Calderon disgustedly went into the bedroom, where Myra joined him.</p>
   <p>"He's asking me riddles again," she said. "Let's see what the Katzenjammers did."</p>
   <p>"You look rather miserable. Got a cold?"</p>
   <p>"I'm not wearing make-up. Alexander says the smell makes him ill."</p>
   <p>"So what? He's no petunia."</p>
   <p>"Well," Myra said, "he does get ill. But of course he does it on purpose."</p>
   <p>"Listen. There he goes again. What now?"</p>
   <p>But Alexander merely wanted an audience. He had found a new way of making imbecilic noises with his fingers and lips. At times the child's normal phases were more trying than his super periods. After a month had passed, however, Calderon felt that the worst was yet to come. Alexander had progressed into fields of knowledge hitherto untouched by homo sap, and he had developed a leechlike habit of sucking his father's brains dry of every scrap of knowledge the wretched man possessed.</p>
   <p>It was the same with Myra. The world was indeed Alexander's oyster. He had an insatiable curiosity about everything, and there was no longer any privacy in the apartment. Calderon took to locking the bedroom door against his son at night – Alexander's crib was now in another room – but furious squalls might waken him at any hour.</p>
   <p>In the midst of preparing dinner, Myra would be forced to stop and explain the caloric mysteries of the oven to Alexander. He learned all she knew, took a jump into more abstruse aspects of the matter, and sneered at her ignorance. He found out Calderon was a physicist, a fact which the man had hitherto kept carefully concealed, and thereafter pumped his father dry. He asked questions about geodetics and geopolitics. He inquired about monotremes and monorails. He was curious about biremes and biology. And he was skeptical, doubting the depth of his father's knowledge. "But," he said, "you and Myra Calderon are my closest contacts with homo sap as yet, and it's a beginning. Put out that cigarette. It isn't good for my lungs."</p>
   <p>"All right," Calderon said. He rose wearily, with his usual feeling these days of being driven from room to room of the apartment, and went in search of Myra. "Bordent's about due. We can go out somewhere. O. K.?"</p>
   <p>"Swell." She was at the mirror, fixing her hair, in a trice. "I need a permanent. If I only had the time –!"</p>
   <p>"I'll take off tomorrow and stay here. You need a rest."</p>
   <p>"Darling, no. The exams are coming up. You simply can't do it."</p>
   <p>Alexander yelled. It developed that he wanted his mother to sing for him. He was curious about the tonal range of homo sap and the probable emotional and soporific effect of lullabies. Calderon mixed himself a drink, sat in the kitchen and smoked, and thought about the glorious destiny of his son. When Myra stopped singing, he listened for Alexander's wails, but there was no sound till a slightly hysterical Myra burst in on him, dithering and wide-eyed.</p>
   <p>"Joe!" She fell into Calderon's arms. "Quick, give me a drink or ... or hold me tight or something."</p>
   <p>"What is it?" He thrust the bottle into her hands, went to the door, and looked out. "Alexander? He's quiet. Eating candy."</p>
   <p>Myra didn't bother with a glass. The bottle's neck clicked against her teeth. "Look at me. Just look at me. I'm a mess."</p>
   <p>"What happened?"</p>
   <p>"Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. Alexander's turned into a black magician, that's all." She dropped into a chair and passed a palm across her forehead. "Do you know what that genius son of ours just did?"</p>
   <p>"Bit you," Calderon hazarded, not doubting it for a minute.</p>
   <p>"Worse, far worse. He started asking me for candy. I said there wasn't any in the house. He told me to go down to the grocery for some. I said I'd have to get dressed first, and I was too tired."</p>
   <p>"Why didn't you ask me to go?"</p>
   <p>"I didn't have the chance. Before I could say boo that infantile Merlin waved a magic wand or something. I ... I was down at the grocery. Behind the candy counter."</p>
   <p>Calderon blinked. "Induced amnesia?"</p>
   <p>"There wasn't any time-lapse. It was just <emphasis>phweet</emphasis> – and there I was. In this rag of a dress, without a speck of makeup on, and my hair coming down in tassels. Mrs. Busherman was there, too, buying a chicken – that cat across the hall. She was kind enough to tell me I ought to take more care of myself. Meow," Myra ended furiously.</p>
   <p>"Good Lord."</p>
   <p>"Teleportation. That's what Alexander says it is. Something new he's picked up. I'm not going to stand for it, Joe. I'm not a rag doll, after all." She was half hysterical.</p>
   <p>Calderon went into the next room and stood regarding his child. There was chocolate smeared around Alexander's mouth.</p>
   <p>"Listen, wise guy," he said. "You leave your mother alone, hear me?"</p>
   <p>"I didn't hurt her," the prodigy pointed out, in a blobby voice. "I was simply being efficient."</p>
   <p>"Well, don't be so efficient. Where did you learn that trick, anyhow?"</p>
   <p>"Teleportation? Quat showed me last night. He can't do it himself, but I'm X Free super, so I can. The power isn't disciplined yet. If I'd tried to teleport Myra Calderon over to Jersey, say, I might have dropped her in the Hudson by mistake."</p>
   <p>Calderon muttered something uncomplimentary. Alexander said, "Is that an Anglo-Saxon derivative?"</p>
   <p>"Never mind about that. You shouldn't have all that chocolate, anyway. You'll make yourself sick. You've already made your mother sick. And you nauseate me."</p>
   <p>"Go away," Alexander said. "I want to concentrate on the taste."</p>
   <p>"No. I said you'd make yourself sick. Chocolate's too rich for you. Give it here. You've had enough." Calderon reached for the paper sack. Alexander disappeared. In the kitchen Myra shrieked.</p>
   <p>Calderon moaned despondently, and turned. As he had expected, Alexander was in the kitchen, on top of the stove, hoggishly stuffing candy into his mouth. Myra was concentrating on the bottle.</p>
   <p>"What a household," Calderon said. "The baby teleporting himself all over the apartment, you getting stewed in the kitchen, and me heading for a nervous breakdown." He started to laugh. "O.K., Alexander. You can keep the candy. I know when to shorten my defensive lines strategically."</p>
   <p>"Myra Calderon," Alexander said. "I want to go back into the other room."</p>
   <p>"Fly in," Calderon suggested. "Here, I'll carry you."</p>
   <p>"Not you. Her. She has a better rhythm when she walks."</p>
   <p>"Staggers, you mean," Myra said, but she obediently put aside the bottle, got up, and laid hold of Alexander. She went out. Calderon was not much surprised to hear her scream a moment later. When he joined the happy family, Myra was sitting on the floor, rubbing her arms and biting her lips. Alexander was laughing.</p>
   <p>"What now?"</p>
   <p>"H-he sh-shocked me," Myra said in a child's voice. "He's like an electric eel. He d-did it on purpose, too. Oh, Alexander, will you <emphasis>stop</emphasis> laughing!"</p>
   <p>"You fell down," the infant crowed in triumph. "You yelled and fell down."</p>
   <p>Calderon looked at Myra, and his mouth tightened. "Did you do that on purpose?" he asked.</p>
   <p>"Yes. She fell down. She looked funny."</p>
   <p>"You're going to look a lot funnier in a minute. X Free super or not, what you need is a good paddling."</p>
   <p>"Joe –" Myra said.</p>
   <p>"Never mind. He's got to learn to be considerate of the rights of others."</p>
   <p>"I'm homo superior," Alexander said, with the air of one clinching an argument.</p>
   <p>"It's homo posterior I'm going to deal with," Calderon announced, and attempted to capture his son. There was a stinging blaze of jolting nervous energy that blasted up through his synapses; he went backwards ignominously, and slammed into the wall, cracking his head hard against it. Alexander laughed like an idiot.</p>
   <p>"You fell down, too," he crowed. "You look funny."</p>
   <p>"Joe," Myra said. "Joe. Are you hurt?"</p>
   <p>Calderon said sourly that he supposed he'd survive. Though, he added, it would probably be wise to lay in a few splints and a supply of blood plasma. "In case he gets interested in vivisection."</p>
   <p>Myra regarded Alexander with troubled speculation. "You're kidding, I hope."</p>
   <p>"I hope so, too."</p>
   <p>"Well – here's Bordent. Let's talk to him."</p>
   <p>Calderon answered the door. The four little men came in solemnly. They wasted no time. They gathered about Alexander, unfolded fresh apparatus from the recesses of their paper clothes, and set to work. The infant said, "I teleported her about eight thousand feet."</p>
   <p>"That far, eh?" Quat said. "Were you fatigued at all?"</p>
   <p>"Not a bit."</p>
   <p>Calderon dragged Bordent aside. "I want to talk to you. I think Alexander needs a spanking."</p>
   <p>"By voraster!" the dwarf said, shocked. "But he's <emphasis>Alexander</emphasis>! He's X Free type super!"</p>
   <p>"Not yet. He's still a baby."</p>
   <p>"But a superbaby. No, no, Joseph Calderon. I must tell you again that disciplinary measures can be applied only by sufficiently intelligent authorities."</p>
   <p>"You?"</p>
   <p>"Oh, not yet," Bordent said. "We don't want to overwork him. There's a limit even to super brain power, especially in the very formative period. He's got enough to do, and his attitudes for social contacts won't need forming for a while yet."</p>
   <p>Myra joined them. "I don't agree with you there. Like all babies, he's antisocial. He may have superhuman powers but he's subhuman as far as mental and emotional balance go."</p>
   <p>"Yeah," Calderon agreed. "This business of giving us electric shocks –"</p>
   <p>"He's only playing," Bordent said.</p>
   <p>"And teleportation. Suppose he teleports me to Times Square when I'm taking a shower?"</p>
   <p>"It's only his play. He's a baby still."</p>
   <p>"But what about us?"</p>
   <p>"You have the hereditary characteristic of parental tolerance," Bordent explained. "As I told you before, Alexander and his race are the reason why tolerance was created in the first place. There's no great need for it with homo sap. I mean there's a wide space between normal tolerance and normal provocation. An ordinary baby may try his parents severely for a few moments at a time, but that's about all. The provocation is far too small to require the tremendous store of tolerance the parents have. But with the X Free type, it's a different matter."</p>
   <p>"There's a limit even to tolerance," Calderon said. "I'm wondering about a creche."</p>
   <p>Bordent shook his shiny metallic-sheathed head. "He needs you."</p>
   <p>"But," Myra said, "but! Can't you give him just a little discipline?"</p>
   <p>"Oh, it isn't necessary. His mind's still immature, and he must concentrate on more important things. You'll tolerate him."</p>
   <p>"It's not as though he's our baby any more," she murmured. "He's not Alexander."</p>
   <p>"But he is. That's just it. <emphasis>He's Alexander!</emphasis>"</p>
   <p>"Look, it's normal for a mother to want to hug her baby. But how can she do that if she expects him to throw her halfway across the room?"</p>
   <p>Calderone was brooding. "Will he pick up more ... more super powers as he goes along?"</p>
   <p>"Why, yes. Naturally."</p>
   <p>"He's a menace to life and limb. I still say he needs discipline. Next time I'll wear rubber gloves."</p>
   <p>"That won't help," Bordent said, frowning. "Besides, I must insist ... no, Joseph Calderon, it won't do. You mustn't interfere. You're not capable of giving him the right sort of discipline – which he doesn't need yet anyway."</p>
   <p>"Just one spanking," Calderon said wistfully. "Not for revenge. Only to show him he's got to consider the rights of others."</p>
   <p>"He'll learn to consider the rights of other X Free supers. You must not attempt anything of the sort. A spanking – even if you succeeded, which is far from probable – might warp him psychologically. We are his tutors, his mentors. We must protect him. You understand?"</p>
   <p>"I think so," Calderon said slowly. "That's a threat."</p>
   <p>"You are Alexander's parents, but it's Alexander who is important. If I must apply disciplinary measures to you, I must."</p>
   <p>"Oh, forget it," Myra sighed. "Joe, let's go out and walk in the park while Bordent's here."</p>
   <p>"Be back in two hours," the little man said. "Good-by."</p>
   <p>As time went past, Calderon could not decide whether Alexander's moronic phases or his periods of keen intelligence were more irritating. The prodigy had learned new powers; the worst of that was that Calderon never knew what to expect, or when some astounding gag would be sprung on him. Such as the time when a mess of sticky taffy had materialized in his bed, filched from the grocery by deft teleportation. Alexander thought it was very funny. He laughed.</p>
   <p>And, when Calderon refused to go to the store to buy candy because he said he had no money – "Now don't try to teleport me. I'm broke." – Alexander had utilized mental energy, warping gravity lines shockingly. Calderon found himself hanging upside-down in midair, being shaken, while loose coins cascaded out of his pocket. He went after the candy.</p>
   <p>Humor is a developed sense, stemming basically from cruelty. The more primitive a mind, the less selectivity exists. A cannibal would probably be profoundly amused by the squirmings of his victim in the seething kettle. A man slips on a banana peel and breaks his back. The adult stops laughing at that point, the child does not. And a civilized ego finds embarrassment as acutely distressing as physical pain. A baby, a child, a moron, is incapable of practicing empathy. He cannot identify himself with another individual. He is regrettably autistic; his own rules are arbitrary, and garbage strewn around the bedroom was funny to neither Myra nor Calderon.</p>
   <p>There was a little stranger in the house. Nobody rejoiced. Except Alexander. He had a lot of fun.</p>
   <p>"No privacy," Calderon said. "He materializes everywhere, at all hours. Darling, I wish you'd see a doctor."</p>
   <p>"What would he advise?" Myra asked. "Rest, that's all. Do you realize it's been two months since Bordent took over?"</p>
   <p>"And we've made marvelous progress," Bordent said, coming over to them. Quat was en rapport with Alexander on the carpet, while the other two dwarfs prepared the makings of a new gadget. "Or, rather, Alexander has made remarkable progress."</p>
   <p>"We need a rest," Calderon growled. "If I lose my job, who'll support that genius of yours?" Myra looked at her husband quickly, noting the possessive pronoun he had used.</p>
   <p>Bordent was concerned. "You are in difficulty?"</p>
   <p>"The Dean's spoken to me once or twice. I can't control my classes any more. I'm too irritable."</p>
   <p>"You don't need to expend tolerance on your students. As for money, we can keep you supplied. I'll arrange to get some negotiable currency for you."</p>
   <p>"But I want to work. I like my job."</p>
   <p>"Alexander is your job."</p>
   <p>"I need a maid," Myra said, looking hopeless. "Can't you make me a robot or something? Alexander scares every maid I've ever managed to hire. They won't stay a day in this madhouse."</p>
   <p>"A mechanical intelligence would have a bad effect on Alexander," Bordent said. "No."</p>
   <p>"I wish we could have guests in once in a while. Or go out visiting. Or just be alone," Myra sighed.</p>
   <p>"Some day Alexander will be mature, and you'll reap your reward. The parents of Alexander. Did I ever tell you that we have images of you two in the Great Fogy Hall?"</p>
   <p>"They must look terrible," Calderon said. "I know we do now."</p>
   <p>"Be patient. Consider the destiny of your son."</p>
   <p>"I do. Often. But he gets a little wearing sometimes. That's quite an understatement."</p>
   <p>"Which is where tolerance comes in," Bordent said. "Nature planned well for the new race."</p>
   <p>"Mm-m-m."</p>
   <p>"He is working on sixth-dimensional abstractions now. Everything is progressing beautifully."</p>
   <p>"Yeah," Calderon said. And he went away, muttering, to join Myra in the kitchen.</p>
   <p>Alexander worked with facility at his gadgets, his pudgy fingers already stronger and surer. He still had an illicit passion for the blue ovoid, but under Bordent's watchful eye he could use it only along the restricted lines laid out by his mentors. When the lesson was finished, Quat selected a few of the objects and locked them in a cupboard, as was his custom. The rest he left on the carpet to provide exercise for Alexander's ingenuity.</p>
   <p>"He develops," Bordent said. "Today we've made a great step."</p>
   <p>Myra and Calderon came in in time to hear this. "What goes?" he asked.</p>
   <p>"A psychic bloc-removal. Alexander will no longer need to sleep."</p>
   <p>"What?" Myra said.</p>
   <p>"He won't require sleep. It's an artificial habit anyway. The super race has no need of it."</p>
   <p>"He won't sleep any more, eh?" Calderon said. He had grown a little pale.</p>
   <p>"Correct. He'll develop faster now, twice as fast."</p>
   <p>At 3:30 a. m. Calderon and Myra lay in bed, wide awake, looking through the open door in to the full blaze of light where Alexander played. Seen there clearly, as if upon a lighted stage, he did not look quite like himself any more. The difference was subtle, but it was there. Under the golden down his head had changed shape slightly, and there was a look of intelligence and purpose upon the blobby features. It was not an attractive look. It didn't belong there. It made Alexander look less like a super-baby than a debased oldster. All a child's normal cruelty and selfishness – perfectly healthy, natural traits in the developing infant – flickered across Alexander's face as he played absorbedly with solid crystal blocks which he was fitting into one another like a Chinese puzzle. It was quite a shocking face to watch.</p>
   <p>Calderon heard Myra sigh beside him.</p>
   <p>"He isn't our Alexander any more," she said. "Not a bit."</p>
   <p>Alexander glanced up and his face suddenly suffused. The look of paradoxical age and degeneracy upon it vanished as he opened his mouth and bawled with rage, tossing the blocks in all directions. Calderon watched one roll through the bedroom door and come to rest upon the carpet, spilling out of its solidity a cascade of smaller and smaller solid blocks that tumbled winking toward him. Alexander's cries filled the apartment. After a moment windows began to slam across the court, and presently the phone rang. Calderon reached for it, sighing.</p>
   <p>When he hung up he looked across at Myra and grimaced. Above the steady roars he said, "Well, we have notice to move."</p>
   <p>Myra said, "Oh. Oh, well."</p>
   <p>"That about covers it."</p>
   <p>They were silent for a moment. Then Calderon said, "Nineteen years more of it. I think we can expect about that. They did say he'd mature at twenty, didn't they?"</p>
   <p>"He'll be an orphan long before then," Myra groaned. "Oh, my head! I think I caught cold when he teleported us up to the roof just before dinner. Joe, do you suppose we're the first parents who ever got ... got caught like this?"</p>
   <p>"What do you mean?"</p>
   <p>"I mean, was there ever another super-baby before Alexander? It does seem like a waste of a lot of tolerance if we're the first to need it."</p>
   <p>"We could use a lot more. We'll need a lot." He said nothing more for awhile, but he lay there thinking and trying not to hear his super-child's rhythmic howling. Tolerance. Every parent needed a great deal of it. Every child was intolerable from time to time. The race had certainly needed parental love in vast quantities to permit its infants to survive. But no parents before had ever been tried consistently up to the very last degree of tolerance. No parents before had ever had to face twenty years of it, day and night, strained to the final notch. Parental love is a great and all-encompassing emotion, but –</p>
   <p>"I wonder," he said thoughtfully. "I wonder if we are the first."</p>
   <p>Myra's speculations had been veering. "I suppose it's like tonsils and appendix," she murmured. "They've outlived their use, but they still hang on. This tolerance is vestigial in reverse. It's been hanging on all these millenniums, waiting for Alexander."</p>
   <p>"Maybe. I wonder – Still, if there ever had been an Alexander before now, we'd have heard of him. So –"</p>
   <p>Myra rose on one elbow and looked at her husband. "You think so?" she said softly. "I'm not so sure. I think it might have happened before."</p>
   <p>Alexander suddenly quieted. The apartment rang with silence for a moment. Then a familiar voice, without words, spoke in both their brains simultaneously.</p>
   <p>"Get me some more milk. And I want it just warm, not hot."</p>
   <p>Joe and Myra looked at one another again, speechless. Myra sighed and pushed the covers back. "I'll go this time," she said. "Something new, eh? I –"</p>
   <p>"Don't dawdle," said the wordless voice, and Myra jumped and gave a little shriek. Electricity crackled audibly through the room, and Alexander's bawling laughter was heard through the doorway.</p>
   <p>"He's about as civilized now as a well-trained monkey, I suppose," Joe remarked, getting out of bed. "I'll go. You crawl back in. And in another year he may reach the elevation of a bushman. After that, if we're still alive, we'll have the pleasure of living with a super-powered cannibal. Eventually he may work up to the level of practical joker. That ought to be interesting." He went out, muttering to himself.</p>
   <p>Ten minutes later, returning to bed, Joe found Myra clasping her knees and looking into space.</p>
   <p>"We aren't the first, Joe," she said, not glancing at him. "I've been thinking. I'm pretty sure we aren't."</p>
   <p>"But we've never heard of any supermen developing –"</p>
   <p>She turned her head and gave him a long, thoughtful look. "No," she said.</p>
   <p>They were silent. Then, "Yes, I see what you mean," he nodded.</p>
   <p>Something crashed in the living room. Alexander chuckled and the sound of splintering wood was loud in the silence of the night. Another window banged somewhere outside.</p>
   <p>"There's a breaking point," Myra said quietly. "There's got to be."</p>
   <p>"Saturation," Joe murmured. "Tolerance saturation – or something. It could have happened."</p>
   <p>Alexander trundled into sight, clutching something blue. He sat down and began to fiddle with bright wires. Myra rose suddenly.</p>
   <p>"Joe, he's got that blue egg! He must have broken into the cupboard."</p>
   <p>Calderon said, "But Quat told him –"</p>
   <p>"It's dangerous!"</p>
   <p>Alexander looked at them, grinned, and bent the wires into a cradle-shape the size of the egg.</p>
   <p>Calderon found himself out of bed and halfway to the door. He stopped before he reached it. "You know," he said slowly, "he might hurt himself with that thing."</p>
   <p>"We'll have to get it away from him," Myra agreed, heaving herself up with tired reluctance.</p>
   <p>"Look at him," Calderon urged. "Just look."</p>
   <p>Alexander was dealing competently with the wires, his hands flickering into sight and out again as he balanced a tesseract beneath the cradle. That curious veil of knowledge gave his chubby face the debased look of senility which they had come to know so well.</p>
   <p>"This will go on and on, you know," Calderon murmured. "Tomorrow he'll look a little less like himself than today. Next week – next month – what will he be like in a year?"</p>
   <p>"I know." Myra's voice was an echo. "Still, I suppose we'll have to –" Her voice trailed to a halt. She stood barefoot beside her husband, watching.</p>
   <p>"I suppose the gadget will be finished," she said, "once he connects up that last wire. We ought to take it away from him."</p>
   <p>"Think we could?"</p>
   <p>"We ought to try."</p>
   <p>They looked at each other. Calderon said, "It looks like an Easter egg. I never heard of an Easter egg hurting anybody."</p>
   <p>"I suppose we're doing him a favor, really," Myra said in a low voice. "A burnt child dreads the fire. Once a kid burns himself on a match, he stays away from matches."</p>
   <p>They stood in silence, watching.</p>
   <p>It took Alexander about three more minutes to succeed in his design, whatever it was. The results were phenomenally effective. There was a flash of white light, a crackle of split air, and Alexander vanished in the dazzle, leaving only a faint burnt smell behind him.</p>
   <p>When the two could see again, they blinked distrustfully at the empty place. "Teleportation?" Myra whispered dazedly.</p>
   <p>"I'll make sure." Calderon crossed the floor and stood looking down at a damp spot on the carpet, with Alexander's shoes in it. He said, "No. Not teleportation." Then he took a long breath. "He's gone, all right. So he never grew up and sent Bordent back in time to move in on us. It never happened."</p>
   <p>"We weren't the first," Myra said in an unsteady, bemused voice. "There's a breaking point, that's all. How sorry I feel for the first parents who don't reach it!"</p>
   <p>She turned away suddenly, but not so suddenly that he could not see she was crying. He hesitated, watching the door. He thought he had better not follow her just yet.</p>
