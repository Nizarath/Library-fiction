    <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>In 1940 two fine science fiction writers married. Not only did Catherine (‘C.L.’) Moore and Henry Kuttner marry their lives, but they also married their writing careers. From two good writers were born whole companies of pseudonymous great writers (Lewis Padgett, Lawrence O’Donnell … to name but thirty). The number of pen-names used by the prolific partners together and apart at one time threatened to swamp the universe of quality SF - indeed, so great was their contribution that when Jack Vance started his illustrious career, a rumour quickly spread that this was yet another reflection of the versatile Kuttner-Moore genius! (A rumour, I hasten to add, that had and has no truth in it whatsoever.)</p>
   <p>In 1958 this fruitful collaboration came to an untimely end. Henry Kuttner died at the age of forty-four, and science fiction was sadly diminished. The two were in the midst of their first television script at the time of Henry Kuttner’s sudden death. C. L. Moore finished the work and continued in the television field until after her second marriage six years later. She has done no science-fiction writing since the late 19505.</p>
   <p>Hamlyn Paperbacks have already published Mutant and Fury, and will continue to bring back into print the works of one of science fiction’s great masters. I do not anticipate the best of Kuttner (and Kuttner-and-Moore)‘s work becoming unavailable again for any significant length of time from now until entertaining and highly polished story-telling goes out of fashion.</p>
   <p>I have re-edited the collections to eliminate annoying overlaps, to make up the books to convenient lengths, and to collect stories in the same series into the same volumes.</p>
   <p>I appreciate this may cause some Kuttner fans of long standing anguish, pain, depletion of resources and the like, but please bear with me; you will now be able to turn your friends on to Galloway Gallegher and Joe, the Hogbens - in a word, ‘otherness’ - without risking your irreplaceable first editions.</p>
   <p>So spread the word. Kuttner is coming back into print. It is now up to you to ensure that future generations of fans are not denied the opportunity to sit amused, baffled, delighted, bewildered, tickled, frightened, amazed, entertained and enthralled by the otherness of the Kuttners, Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore.</p>

   <section>
    <p>The whole system of which he was a part was doomed, he knew - a mercenary army that fought other mercenary armies for cities that lay beneath the seas of Venus. Yet - there was a fascination and a reasonless loyalty to that futile system that held him.</p>

     <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>A half mile beneath the shallow Venusian Sea the black impervium dome that protects Montana Keep rests frowningly on the bottom. Within the Keep is carnival, for the Montanans celebrate the four-hundred-year anniversary of Earthman’s landing on Venus. Under the great dome that houses the city all is light and colour and gaiety. Masked men and women, bright in celoflex and silks, wander through the broad streets, laughing, drinking the strong native wines of Venus. The sea bottom has been combed, like the hydroponic tanks, for rare delicacies to grace the tables of the nobles.</p>
    <p>Through the festival grim shadows stalk, men whose faces mark them unmistakably as members of a Free Company. Their finery cannot disguise that stamp, hard-won through years of battle. Under the domino masks their mouths are hard and harsh. Unlike the undersea dwellers, their skins are burned black with the ultraviolet rays that filter through the cloud layer of Venus. They are skeletons at the feast.</p>
    <p>They are respected but resented. They are Free Companions …</p>
    <p>We are on Venus, nine hundred years ago, beneath the Sea of Shoals, not much north of the equator. But there is a wide range in time and space. All over the cloud planet the underwater Keeps are dotted, and life will not change for many centuries. Looking back, as we do now, from the civilized days of the Thirty-fourth Century, it is too easy to regard the men of the Keeps as savages, groping, stupid and brutal. The Free Companies have long since vanished. The islands and continents of Venus have been tamed, and there is no war.</p>
    <p>But in periods of transition, of desperate rivalry, there is always war. The Keeps fought among themselves, each striving to draw the fangs of the others by depriving them of their reserves of korium, the power source of the day. Students of that era find pleasure in sifting the legends and winnowing out the basic social and geopolitical truths. It is fairly well known that only one factor saved the Keeps from annihilating one another - the gentlemen’s agreement that left war to the warriors, and allowed the undersea cities to develop their science and social cultures. That particular compromise was, perhaps, inevitable. And it caused the organization of the Free Companies, the roving bands of mercenaries, highly trained for their duties, who hired themselves out to fight for whatever Keeps were attacked or wished to attack.</p>
    <p>Ap Towrn, in his monumental ‘Cycle of Venus,’ tells the saga through symbolic legends. Many historians have recorded the sober truth, which unfortunately seems often Mars-dry. But it is not generally realized that the Free Companions were almost directly responsible for our present high culture. War, because of them, was not permitted to usurp the place of peacetime social and scientific work. Fighting was highly specialized, and, because of technical advances, manpower was no longer important. Each band of Free Companions numbered a few thousand, seldom more.</p>
    <p>It was a strange, lonely life they must have led, shut out from the normal life of the Keeps. They were vestigian but necessary, like the fangs of the marsupians who eventually evolved into Homo sapiens. But without those warriors, the Keeps would have been plunged completely into total war, with fatally destructive results.</p>
    <p>Harsh, gallant, indomitable, serving the god of battles so that it might be destroyed - working toward their own obliteration - the Free Companies roar down the pages of history, the banner of Mars streaming above them in the misty air of Venus. They were doomed as Tyrannosaur Rex was doomed, and they fought on as he did, serving, in their strange way, the shape of Minerva that stood behind Mars.</p>
    <p>Now they are gone. We can learn much by studying the place they held in the Undersea Period. For, because of them, civilization rose again to the heights it had once reached on Earth, and far beyond.</p>
    <p>‘These lords shall light the mystery Of mastery or victory, And these ride high in history, But these shall not return.’</p>
    <p>The Free Companions hold their place in interplanetary literature. They are a legend now, archaic and strange. For they were fighters, and war has gone with unification. But we can understand them a little more than could the people of the Keeps.</p>
    <p>This story, built on legends and fact, is about a typical warrior of the period-Captain Brian Scott of Doone’s Free Companions. He may never have existed -</p>

    <p>Scott drank stinging uisqueplus and glowered across the smoky tavern. He was a hard, stocky man, with thick grey-shot brown hair and the scar of an old wound crinkling his chin. He was thirty-odd, looking like the veteran he was, and he had sense enough to wear a plain suit of blue celoflex, rather than the garish silks and rainbow fabrics that were all around him.</p>
    <p>Outside, through the transparent walls, a laughing throng was carried to and fro along the movable ways. But in the tavern it was silent, except for the low voice of a harpman as he chanted some old ballad, accompanying himself on his complicated instrument. The song came to an end. There was scattered applause, and from the hot-box overhead the blaring music of an orchestra burst out. Instantly the restraint was gone. In the booths and at the bar men and women began to laugh and talk with casual unrestraint. Couples were dancing now.</p>
    <p>The girl beside Scott, a slim, tan-skinned figure with glossy black ringlets cascading to her shoulders, turned inquiring eyes to him.</p>
    <p>‘Want to, Brian?’</p>
    <p>Scott’s mouth twisted in a wry grimace. ‘Suppose so, Jeana. Eh?’ He rose, and she came gracefully into his arms. Brian did not dance too well, but what he lacked in practice he made up in integration. Jeana’s heart-shaped face, with its high cheekbones and vividly crimson lips, lifted to him.</p>
    <p>‘Forget Bienne. He’s just trying to ride you.’</p>
    <p>Scott glanced toward a distant booth, where two girls sat with a man - Commander Fredric Bienne of the Doones. He was a gaunt, tall, bitter-faced man, his regular features twisted into a perpetual sneer, his eyes sombre under heavy dark brows. He was pointing now, toward the couple on the floor.</p>
    <p>‘I know,’ Scott said. ‘He’s doing it, too. Well, the hell with him. So I’m a captain now and he’s still a commander. That’s tough. Next time he’ll obey orders and not send his ship out of the line, trying to ram.’</p>
    <p>‘That was it, eh?’ Jeana asked. ‘I wasn’t sure. There’s plenty of talk.’</p>
    <p>‘There always is. Oh, Bienne’s hated me for years. I reciprocate. We simply don’t get on together. Never did. Every time I got a promotion, he chewed his nails. Figured he had a longer service record than I had, and deserved to move up faster. But he’s too much of an individualist - at the wrong times.’</p>
    <p>‘He’s drinking a lot,’ Jeana said.</p>
    <p>‘Let him. Three months we’ve been in Montana Keep. The boys get tired of inaction-being treated like this.’ Scott nodded toward the door, where a Free Companion was arguing with the keeper. ‘No noncoms allowed in here. Well, the devil with it.’</p>
    <p>They could not hear the conversation above the hubbub, but its importance was evident. Presently the soldier shrugged, his mouth forming a curse, and departed. A fat man in scarlet silks shouted encouragement.</p>
    <p>‘-want any … Companions here!’</p>
    <p>Scott saw Commander Bienne, his eyes half closed, get up and walk toward the fat man’s booth. His shoulder moved in an imperceptible shrug. The hell with civilians, anyhow. Serve the lug right if Bienne smashed his greasy face. And that seemed the probable outcome. For the fat man was accompanied by a girl, and obviously wasn’t going to back down, though Bienne, standing too close to him, was saying something insulting, apparently.</p>
    <p>The auxiliary hot-box snapped some quick syllables, lost in the general tumult. But Scott’s trained ear caught the words. He nodded to Jeana, made a significant clicking noise with his tongue, and said, ‘This is it.’</p>
    <p>She, too, had heard. She let Scott go. He headed toward the fat man’s booth just in time to see the beginning of a brawl. The civilian, red as a turkey cock, had struck out suddenly, landing purely by accident on Bienne’s gaunt cheek. The commander, grinning tightly, stepped back a pace, his fist clenching. Scott caught the other’s arm.</p>
    <p>‘Hold it, commander.’</p>
    <p>Bienne swung around, glaring. ‘What business is it of yours? Let-‘</p>
    <p>The fat man, seeing his opponent’s attention distracted, acquired more courage and came in swinging. Scott reached past Bienne, planted his open hand in the civilian’s face, and pushed hard. The fat man almost fell backward on his table.</p>
    <p>As he rebounded he saw a gun in Scott’s hand. The captain said curtly,’ ‘Tend to your knitting, mister.’</p>
    <p>The civilian licked his lips, hesitated, and sat down. Under his breath he muttered something about too-damn-cocky Free Companions.</p>
    <p>Bienne was trying to break free, ready to swing on the captain. Scott bolstered his gun. ‘Orders,’ he told the other, jerking his head toward the hot-box. ‘Get it?’</p>
    <p>‘-mobilization. Doonemen report to headquarters. Captain Scott to Administration. Immediate mobilization-‘</p>
    <p>‘Oh,’ Bienne said, though he still scowled. ‘O.K. I’ll take over. There was time for me to take a crack at that louse, though.’</p>
    <p>‘You know what instant mobilization means,’ Scott grunted. ‘We may have to leave at an instant’s notice. Orders, commander.’</p>
    <p>Bienne saluted halfheartedly and turned away. Scott went back to his own booth. Jeana had already gathered her handbag and gloves and was applying lip juice.</p>
    <p>She met his eyes calmly enough.</p>
    <p>‘I’ll be at the apartment, Brian. Luck.’</p>
    <p>He kissed her briefly, conscious of a surging excitement at the.prospect of a new venture. Jeana understood his emotion. She gave him a quick, wry smile, touched his hair lightly, and rose. They went out into the gay tumult of the ways.</p>
    <p>Perfumed wind blew into Scott’s face. He wrinkled his nose disgustedly. During carnival seasons the Keeps were less pleasant to the Free Companions than otherwise; they felt more keenly the gulf that lay between them and the undersea dwellers. Scott pushed his way through the crowd and took Jeana across the ways to the centre fast-speed strip. They found seats.</p>
    <p>At a clover-leaf intersection Scott left the girl, heading toward Administration, the cluster of taller buildings in the city’s centre. The technical and political headquarters were centred here, except for the laboratories, which were in the suburbs near the base of the Dome. There were a few small test-domes a mile or so distant from the city, but these were used only for more precarious experiments. Glancing up, Scott was reminded of the catastrophe that had unified science into something like a freemasonry. Above him, hanging without gravity over a central plaza, was the globe of the Earth, half shrouded by the folds of a black plastic pall. In every Keep on Venus there was a similar ever-present reminder of the lost mother planet.</p>
    <p>Scott’s gaze went up farther, to the Dome, as though he could penetrate the impervium and the mile-deep layer of water and the clouded atmosphere to the white star that hung in space, one quarter as brilliant as the Sun. A star -all that remained of Earth, since atomic power had been unleashed there two centuries ago. The scourge had spread like flame, melting continents and levelling mountains. In the libraries there were wire-tape pictorial records of the Holocaust. A religious cult - Men of the New Judgment -had sprung up, and advocated the complete destruction of science; followers of that dogma still existed here and there. But the cult’s teeth had been drawn when technicians unified, outlawing experiments with atomic power forever, making use of that force punishable by death, and permitting no one to join their society without taking the Minervan Oath.</p>
    <p>‘-to work for the ultimate good of mankind … taking all precaution against harming humanity and science … requiring permission from those in authority before undertaking any experiment involving peril to the race … remembering always the extent of the trust placed in us and remembering forever the death of the mother planet through misuse of knowledge-‘</p>
    <p>The Earth. A strange sort of world it must have been, Scott thought. Sunlight, for one thing, unfiltered by the cloud layer. In the old days, there had been few unexplored areas left on Earth. But here on Venus, where the continents had not yet been conquered - there was no need, of course, since everything necessary to life could be produced under the Domes-here on Venus, there was still a frontier. In the Keeps, a highly specialized social culture. Above the surface, a primeval world, where only the Free Companions had their fortresses and navies-the navies for fighting, the forts to house the technicians who provided the latter-day sinews of war, science instead of money. The Keeps tolerated visits from the Free Companions, but would not offer them headquarters, so violent the feeling, so sharp the schism, in the public mind, between war and cultural progress.</p>
    <p>Under Scott’s feet the sliding way turned into an escalator, carrying him into the Administration Building. He stepped to another way which took him to a lift, and, a moment or two later, was facing the door-curtain bearing the face of President Dane Crosby of Montana Keep.</p>
    <p>Crosby’s voice said, ‘Come in, captain,’ and Scott brushed through the curtain, finding himself in a medium-sized room with muralled walls and a great window overlooking the city. Crosby, a white-haired, thin figure in blue silks, was at his desk. He looked like a tired old clerk out of Dickens, Scott thought suddenly, entirely undistinguished and ordinary. Yet Crosby was one of the great sociopoliticians on Venus.</p>
    <p>Cine Rhys, leader of Doone’s Free Companions, was sitting in a relaxer, the apparent antithesis of Crosby. All the moisture in Rhys’ body seemed to have been sucked out of him years ago by ultraviolet actinic, leaving a mummy of brown leather and whipcord sinew. There was no softness in the man. His smile was a grimace. Muscles lay like wire under the swarthy cheeks.</p>
    <p>Scott saluted. Rhys waved him to a relaxer. The look of subdued eagerness in the Cine’s eyes was significant - an eagle poising himself, smelling blood. Crosby sensed that, and a wry grin showed on his pale face.</p>
    <p>‘Every man to his trade,’ he remarked, semi-ironically. Tsuppose I’d be bored stiff if I had too long a vacation. But you’ll have quite a battle on your hands this time. Cine Rhys.’</p>
    <p>Scott’s stocky body tensed automatically. Rhys glanced at him.</p>
    <p>‘Virginia Keep is attacking, captain. They’ve hired the Helldivers - Flynn’s outfit.’</p>
    <p>There was a pause. Both Free Companions were anxious to discuss the angles, but unwilling to do so in the presence of a civilian, even the president of Montana Keep. Crosby rose.</p>
    <p>‘The money settlement’s satisfactory, then?’</p>
    <p>Rhys nodded. ‘Yes, that’s all right. I expect the battle will take place in a couple of days. In the neighbourhood of Venus Deep, at a rough guess.’</p>
    <p>‘Good. I’ve a favour to ask, so if you’ll excuse me for a few minutes, I’ll-‘ He left the sentence unfinished and went out through the door-curtain. Rhys offered Scott a cigarette.</p>
    <p>‘You get the implications, captain - the Helldivers?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, sir. Thanks. We can’t do it alone.’</p>
    <p>‘Right. We’re short on manpower and armament both. And the Helldivers recently merged with O’Brien’s Legion, after O’Brien was killed in that polar scrap. They’re a strong outfit, plenty strong. Then they’ve got their speciality - submarine attack. I’d say we’ll have to use H-plan 7.’</p>
    <p>Scott closed his eyes, remembering the files. Each Free Company kept up-to-date plans of attack suited to the merits of every other Company of Venus. Frequently revised as new advances were made, as groups merged, and as the balance of power changed on each side, the plans were so detailed that they could be carried into action at literally a moment’s notice. H-plan 7, Scott recalled, involved enlisting the aid of the Mob, a small but well-organized band of Free Companions led by Cine Tom Mendez.</p>
    <p>‘Right,’ Scott said. ‘Can you get him?’</p>
    <p>‘I think so. We haven’t agreed yet on the bonus. I’ve been telaudioing him on a tight beam, but he keeps putting me off - waiting till the last moment, when he can dictate his own terms.’</p>
    <p>‘What’s he asking, sir?’</p>
    <p>‘Fifty thousand cash and a fifty per cent cut on the loot.’</p>
    <p>‘I’d say thirty per cent would be about right.’</p>
    <p>Rhys nodded. ‘I’ve offered him thirty-five. I may send you to his fort-carte blanche. We can get another Company, but Mendez has got beautiful sub-detectors - which would come hi handy against the Helldivers. Maybe I can settle things by audio. If not, you’ll have to fly over to Mendez and buy his services, at less than fifty per cent if you can.’</p>
    <p>Scott rubbed the old scar on his chin with a calloused forefinger. ‘Meantime Commander Bienne’s in charge of mobilization. When-‘</p>
    <p>‘I telaudioed our fort. Air transports are on the way now.’</p>
    <p>‘It’ll be quite a scrap,’ Scott said, and the eyes of the two men met in perfect understanding. Rhys chuckled drylyx.</p>
    <p>‘And good profits. Virginia Keep has a big supply of korium … dunno how much, but plenty.’</p>
    <p>‘What started the fracas this time?’</p>
    <p>‘The usual thing, I suppose,’ Rhys said disinterestedly. ‘Imperialism. Somebody in Virginia Keep worked out a new plan for annexing the rest of the.Keeps. Same as usual.’</p>
    <p>They stood up as the door-curtain swung back, admitting President Crosby, another man, and a girl. The man looked young, his boyish face not yet toughened under actinic burn. The girl was lovely in the manner of a plastic figurine, lit from within by vibrant life. Her blonde hair was cropped in the prevalent mode, and her eyes, Scott saw, were an unusual shade of green. She was more than merely pretty - she was instantly exciting.</p>
    <p>Crosby said, ‘My niece, Ilene Kane - and my nephew, Norman Kane.’ He performed introductions, and they found seats.</p>
    <p>‘What about drinks?’ Ilene suggested. ‘This is rather revoltingly formal. The fight hasn’t started yet, after all.’</p>
    <p>Crosby shook his head at her. ‘You weren’t invited here anyway. Don’t try to turn this into a party - there isn’t too much time, under the circumstances.’</p>
    <p>‘O.K.,’ Ilene murmured. ‘I can wait.’ She eyed Scott interestedly.</p>
    <p>Norman Kane broke in. ‘I’d like to join Doone’s Free Companions, sir. I’ve already applied, but now that there’s a battle coming up, I hate to wait till my application’s approved. So I thought -‘</p>
    <p>Crosby looked at Cine Rhys. ‘A personal favour, but the decision’s up to you. My nephew’s a misfit - a romanticist. Never liked the life of a Keep. A year ago he went off and joined Starling’s outfit.’</p>
    <p>Rhys raised an eyebrow. ‘That gang? It’s not a recommendation, Kane. They’re not even classed as Free Companions. More like a band of guerrillas, and entirely without ethics. There’ve even been rumours they’re messing around with atomic power.’</p>
    <p>Crosby looked startled. ‘I hadn’t heard that.’</p>
    <p>‘It’s no more than a rumour. If it’s ever proved, the Free Companions - all of them - will get together and smash Starling in a hurry.’</p>
    <p>Norman Kane looked slightly uncomfortable. ‘I suppose I was rather a fool. But I wanted to get in the fighting game, and Starling’s groups appealed to me-‘</p>
    <p>The cine made a sound in his throat. ‘They would. Swashbuckling romantics, with no idea of what war means. They’ve not more than a dozen technicians. And they’ve no discipline - it’s like a pirate outfit. War today, Kane, isn’t won by romantic animals dashing at forlorn hopes. The modern soldier is a tactician who knows how to think, integrate, and obey. If you join our Company, you’ll have to forget what you learned with Starling.’</p>
    <p>‘Will you take me, sir?’</p>
    <p>‘I think it would be unwise. You need the training course.’</p>
    <p>‘I’ve had experience -‘</p>
    <p>Crosby said, ‘It would be a favour, Cine Rhys, if you’d skip the red tape. I’d appreciate it. Since my nephew wants to be a soldier, I’d much prefer to see him with the Doones.’</p>
    <p>Rhys shrugged. ‘Very well, Captain Scott will give you your orders, Kane. Remember that discipline is vitally important with us.’</p>
    <p>The boy tried to force back a delighted grin. ‘Thank you, sir.’</p>
    <p>‘Captain -‘</p>
    <p>Scott rose and nodded to Kane. They went out together. In the anteroom was a telaudio set, and Scott called the Doone’s local headquarters in Montana Keep. An integrator answered, his face looking inquiringly from the screen.</p>
    <p>‘Captain Scott calling, subject induction.’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, sir. Ready to record.’</p>
    <p>Scott drew Kane forward. Thotosnap this man. He’ll report to headquarters immediately. Name, Norman Kane. Enlist him without training course - special orders from Cine Rhys.’</p>
    <p>‘Acknowledged, sir.’</p>
    <p>Scott broke the connection. Kane couldn’t quite repress his grin.</p>
    <p>‘All right,’ the captain grunted, a sympathetic gleam in his eyes. ‘That fixes it. They’ll put you in my command. What’s your speciality.’</p>
    <p>‘Flitterboats, sir.’</p>
    <p>‘Good. One more thing. Don’t forget what Cine Rhys said, Kane. Discipline is damned important, and you may not have realized that yet. This isn’t a cloak-and-sword war. There are no Charges of Light Brigades. No grandstand plays - that stuff went out with the Crusades. Just obey orders, and you’ll have no trouble. Good luck.’</p>
    <p>‘Thank you, sir.’ Kane saluted and strode out with a perceptible swagger. Scott grinned. The kid would have that knocked out of him pretty soon.</p>
    <p>A voice at his side made him turn quickly. Ilene Kane was standing there, slim and lovely in her celoflex gown.</p>
    <p>‘You seem pretty human after all, captain,’ she said. ‘I heard what you told Norman.’</p>
    <p>Scott shrugged. ‘I did that for his own good - and the good of the Company. One man off the beam can cause plenty trouble, Mistress Kane.’</p>
    <p>‘I envy Norman,’ she said. ‘It must be a fascinating life you lead. I’d like it - for a while. Not for long. I’m one of the useless offshoots of this civilization, not much good for anything. So I’ve perfected one talent.’</p>
    <p>‘What’s that?’</p>
    <p>‘Oh, hedonism, I suppose you’d call it. I enjoy myself. It’s not often too boring. But I’m a bit bored now. I’d like to talk to you, captain.’</p>
    <p>‘Well. I’m listening,’ Scott said.</p>
    <p>Ilene Kane made a small grimace. ‘Wrong semantic term. I’d like to get inside of you psychologically. But painlessly. Dinner and dancing. Can do?’</p>
    <p>‘There’s no time,’ Scott told her. ‘We may get our orders any moment.’ He wasn’t sure he wanted to go out with this girl of the Keeps, though there was definitely a subtle fascination for him, an appeal he could not analyse. She typified the most pleasurable part of a world he did not know. The other facets of that world could not impinge on him; geopolitics or nonmilitary science held no appeal, were too alien. But all worlds touch at one point - pleasure. Scott could understand the relaxations of the undersea groups, as he could not understand or feel sympathy for their work or their social impulses.</p>
    <p>Cine Rhys came through the door-curtain, his eyes narrowed. ‘I’ve some telaudioing to do, captain,’ he said. Scott knew what implications the words held: the incipient bargain with Cine Mendez. He nodded.</p>
    <p>‘Yes, sir. Shall I report to headquarters?’</p>
    <p>Rhys’ harsh face seemed to relax suddenly as he looked from Ilene to Scott. ‘You’re free till dawn. I won’t need you till then, but report to me at 6 a.m. No doubt you’ve a few details to clean up.’</p>
    <p>‘Very well, sir.’ Scott watched Rhys go out. The cine had meant Jeana, of course. But Ilene did not know that.</p>
    <p>‘So?’ she asked. ‘Do I get a turn-down? You might buy me a drink, anyway.’</p>
    <p>There was plenty of time. Scott said, ‘It’ll be a pleasure,’ and Ilene linked her arm with his. They took the dropper to ground-level.</p>
    <p>As they came out on one of the ways, Ilene turned her head and caught Scott’s glance. ‘I forgot something, captain. You may have a previous engagement. I didn’t realize -‘</p>
    <p>‘There’s nothing,’ he said. ‘Nothing important.’</p>
    <p>It was true; he felt a mild gratitude toward Jeana at the realization. His relationship with her was the peculiar one rendered advisable by his career. Free-marriage was the word for it; Jeana was neither his wife nor his mistress, but something midway between. The Free Companions had no firmly grounded foundation for social life; in the Keeps they were visitors, and in their coastal forts they were - well, soldiers. One would no more bring a woman to a fort than aboard a ship of the line. So the women of the Free Companions lived in the Keeps, moving from one to another as their men did; and because of the ever-present shadow of death, ties were purposely left loose. Jeana and Scott had been free-married for five years now. Neither made demands on the other. No one expected fidelity of a Free Companion. Soldiers lived under such iron disciplines that when they were released, during the brief peacetimes, the pendulum often swung far in the opposite direction.</p>
    <p>To Scott, Ilene Kane was a key that might unlock the doors of the Keep - doors that opened to a world of which he was not a part, and which he could not quite understand.</p>

    <p>There were nuances, Scott found, which he had never known existed. A hedonist hike Ilene devoted her life to such nuances; they were her career. Such minor matters as making the powerful, insipid Moonflower Cocktails more palatable by filtering them through lime-soaked sugar held between the teeth. Scott was a uisqueplus man, having the average soldier’s contempt for what he termed hydroponic drinks, but the cocktails Ilene suggested were quite as effective as acrid, burning amber uisqueplus. She taught him, that night, such tricks as pausing between glasses to sniff lightly at happy-gas, to mingle sensual excitement with mental by trying the amusement rides designed to give one the violent physical intoxication of breathless speed. Nuances all, which only a girl with Ilene’s background could know. She was not representative of Keep life. As she had said, she was an offshoot, a casual and useless flower on the great vine that struck up inexorably to the skies, its strength in its tough, reaching tendrils - scientists and technicians and sociopoliticians. She was doomed in her own way, as Scott was in his. The undersea folk served Minerva; Scott served Mars; and Ilene served Aphrodite - not purely the sexual goddess, but the patron of arts and pleasure. Between Scott and Ilene was the difference between Wagner and Strauss; the difference between crashing chords and tinkling arpeggios. In both was a muted bittersweet sadness, seldom realized by either. But that undertone was brought out by then-contact. The sense of dim hopelessness in each responded to the other.</p>
    <p>It was carnival, but neither Ilene nor Scott wore masks. Their faces were masks enough, and both had been trained to reserve, though in different ways. Scott’s hard mouth kept its tight grimness even when he smiled. And Ilene’s smiles came so often that they were meaningless.</p>
    <p>Through her, Scott was able to understand more of the undersea life than he had ever done before. She was for him a catalyst. A tacit understanding grew between them, not needing words. Both realized that, in the course of progress, they would eventually die out. Mankind tolerated them because that was necessary for a little time. Each responded differently. Scott served Mars; he served actively; and the girl, who was passive, was attracted by the antithesis.</p>
    <p>Scott’s drunkenness struck psychically deep. He did not show it. His stiff silver-brown hair was not disarranged, and his hard, burned face was impassive as ever. But when his brown eyes met Ilene’s green ones a spark of-something-met between them.</p>
    <p>Colour and light and sound. They began to form a pattern now, were not quite meaningless to Scott. They were, long past midnight, sitting in an Olympus, which was a private cosmos. The walls of the room in which they were seemed nonexistent. The gusty tides of grey, faintly luminous clouds seemed to drive chaotically past them, and, dimly, they could hear the muffled screaming of an artificial wind. They had the isolation of the gods.</p>
    <p>And the Earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep-That was, of course, the theory of the Olympus rooms. No one existed, no world existed, outside of the chamber; values automatically shifted, and inhibitions seemed absurd.</p>
    <p>Scott relaxed on a translucent cushion like a cloud. Beside him, Ilene lifted the bit of a happy-gas tube to his nostrils. He shook his head.</p>
    <p>‘Not now, Ilene.’</p>
    <p>She let the tube slide back into its reel. ‘Nor I. Too much of anything is unsatisfactory, Brian. There should always be something untasted, some anticipation left - You have that. I haven’t.’</p>
    <p>‘How?’</p>
    <p>‘Pleasures - well, there’s a limit. There’s a limit to human endurance. And eventually I build up a resistance psychically, as I do physically, to everything. With you, there’s always the last adventure. You never know when death will come. You can’t plan. Plans are dull; it’s the unexpected that’s important.’</p>
    <p>Scott shook his head slightly. ‘Death isn’t important either. It’s an automatic cancellation of values. Or, rather - ‘He hesitated, seeking words. ‘In this life you can plan, you can work out values, because they’re all based on certain conditions. On - let’s say - arithmetic. Death is a change to a different plane of conditions, quite unknown. Arithmetical rules don’t apply as such to geometry.’</p>
    <p>‘You think death has its rules?’</p>
    <p>‘It may be a lack of rules, Ilene. One lives realizing that life is subject to death; civilization is based on that. That’s why civilization concentrates on the race instead of the individual. Social self-preservation.’</p>
    <p>She looked at him gravely. ‘I didn’t think a Free Companion could theorize that way.’</p>
    <p>Scott closed his eyes, relaxing. ‘The Keeps know nothing about Free Companions. They don’t want to. We’re men. Intelligent men. Our techniques are as great as the scientists under the Domes.’</p>
    <p>‘But they work for war.’</p>
    <p>‘War’s necessary,’ Scott said. ‘Now, anyway.’</p>
    <p>‘How did you get into it? Should I ask?’</p>
    <p>He laughed a little at that. ‘Oh, I’ve no dark secrets in my past. I’m not a runaway murderer. One-drifts. I was born in Australia Keep. My father was a tech, but my grandfather had been a soldier. I guess it was in my blood. I tried various trades and professions. Meaningless. I wanted something that … hell, I don’t know. Something, maybe that needs all of a man. Fighting does. It’s like a religion. Those cultists - Men of the New Judgment - they’re fanatics, but you can see that their religion is the only thing that matters to them.’</p>
    <p>‘Bearded, dirty men with twisted minds, though.’</p>
    <p>‘It happens to be a religion based on false premises. There are others, appealing to different types. But religion was too passive for me, in these days.’</p>
    <p>Ilene examined his harsh face. ‘You’d have preferred the church militant-the Knights of Malta, fighting Saracens.’</p>
    <p>‘I suppose. I had no values. Anyhow, I’m a fighter.’</p>
    <p>‘Just how important is it to you? The Free Companions?’</p>
    <p>Scott opened his eyes and grinned at the girl. He looked unexpectedly boyish.</p>
    <p>‘Damn little, really. It has emotional appeal. Intellectually, I know that it’s a huge fake. Always has been. As absurd as the Men of the new Judgment. Fighting’s doomed. So we’ve no real purpose. I suppose most of us know there’s no future for the Free Companions. In a few hundred years-well!’</p>
    <p>‘And still you go on. Why? It isn’t money.’</p>
    <p>‘No. There is a … a drunkenness to it. The ancient Norsemen had their berserker madness. We have something similar. To a Dooneman, his group is father, mother, child, and God Almighty. He fights the other Free Companions when he’s paid to do so, but he doesn’t hate the others. They serve the same toppling idol. And it is toppling, Ilene. Each battle we win or lose brings us closer to the end. We fight to protect the culture that eventually will wipe us out. The Keeps-when they finally unify, will they need a military arm? I can see the trend. If war was an essential part of civilization, each Keep would maintain its own military. But they shut us out-a necessary evil. If they would end war now!’ Scott’s fist unconsciously clenched. ‘So many men would find happier places in Venus-undersea. But as long as the Free Companions exist, there’ll be new recruits.’</p>
    <p>Ilene sipped her cocktail, watching the grey chaos of clouds flow like a tide around them. In the dimly luminous light Scott’s face seemed like dark stone, flecks of brightness showing in his eyes. She touched his hand gently.</p>
    <p>‘You’re a soldier, Brian. You wouldn’t change.’</p>
    <p>His laugh was intensely bitter. ‘Like hell I wouldn’t, Mistress Ilene Kane! Do you think fighting’s just pulling a trigger? I’m a military strategist. That took ten years. Harder cramming than I’d have had in a Keep Tech-Institute. I have to know everything about war from trajectories to mass psychology. This is the greatest science</p>
    <p>the System has ever known, and the most useless. Because war will die in a few centuries at most. Ilene - you’ve never seen a Free Company’s fort. It’s science, marvellous science, aimed at military ends only. We have our psych-specialists. We have our engineers, who plan everything from ordnance to the frictional quotient on flitterboats. We have the foundries and mills. Each fortress is a city made for war, as the Keeps are made for social progress.’</p>
    <p>‘As complicated as that?’</p>
    <p>‘Beautifully complicated and beautifully useless. There are so many of us who realize that. Oh, we fight - it’s a poison. We worship the Company - that is an emotional poison. But we live only during wartime. It’s an incomplete life. Men in the Keeps have full lives; they have their work, and their relaxations are geared to fit them. We don’t fit.’</p>
    <p>‘Not all the undersea races,’ Ilene said. ‘There’s always the fringe that doesn’t fit. At least you have a raison d’etre. You’re a soldier. I can’t make a lifework out of pleasure. But there’s nothing else for me.’</p>
    <p>Scott’s fingers tightened on hers. ‘You’re the product of a civilization, at least. I’m left out.’</p>
    <p>‘With you, Brian, it might be better. For a while. I don’t think it would last for long.’</p>
    <p>‘It might.’</p>
    <p>‘You think so now. It’s quite a horrible thing, feeling yourself a shadow.’</p>
    <p>‘I know.’</p>
    <p>‘I want you, Brian,’ Ilene said, turning to face him. ‘I want you to come to Montana Keep and stay here. Until our experiment fails. I think it’ll fail presently. But, perhaps, not for some time. I need your strength. I can show you how to get the most out of this sort of life - how to enter into it. True hedonism. You can give me-companionship perhaps. For me the companionship of hedonists who know nothing else isn’t enough.’</p>
    <p>Scott was silent. Ilene watched him for a while.</p>
    <p>‘Is war so important?’ she asked at last.</p>
    <p>‘No,’ he said, ‘it isn’t at all. It’s a balloon. And it’s empty, I know that. Honour of the regiment!’ Scott laughed. ‘I’m not hesitating, really. I’ve been shut out for a long time. A social unit shouldn’t be founded on an obviously doomed fallacy. Men and women are important, nothing else, I suppose.’</p>
    <p>‘Men and women - or the race?’</p>
    <p>‘Not the race,’ he said with abrupt violence. ‘Damn the race! It’s done nothing for me. I can fit myself into a new life. Not necessarily hedonism. I’m an expert in several lines; I have to be. I can find work in Montana Keep.’</p>
    <p>‘If you like. I’ve never tried. I’m more of a fatalist, I suppose. But … what about it, Brian?’</p>
    <p>Her eyes were almost luminous, like shining emeralds, in the ghostly light.</p>
    <p>‘Yes,’ Scott said. ‘I'll come back. To stay.’</p>
    <p>Ilene said, ‘Come back? Why not stay now?’</p>
    <p>‘Because I’m a complete fool, I guess. I’m a key man, and Cine Rhys needs me just now.’</p>
    <p>‘Is it Rhys or the Company?’</p>
    <p>Scott smiled crookedly. ‘Not the Company. It’s just a job I have to do. When I think how many years I’ve been slaving, pretending absurdities were important, knowing that I was bowing to a straw dummy-No! I want your life-the son of life I didn’t know could exist in the Keeps. I’ll be back, Ilene. It’s something more important than love. Separately we’re halves. Together we may be a complete whole.’</p>
    <p>She didn’t answer. Her eyes were steady on Scott’s. He kissed her.</p>
    <p>Before morning bell he was back in the apartment. Jeana had already packed the necessary light equipment. She was asleep, her dark hair cascading over the pillow, and Scott did not waken her. Quietly he shaved, showered, and dressed. A heavy, waiting silence seemed to fill the city like a cup brimmed with stillness.</p>
    <p>As he emerged from the bathroom, buttoning his tunic, he saw the table had been let down and two places set at it. Jeana came in, wearing a cool morning frock. She set cups down and poured coffee.</p>
    <p>‘Morning, soldier,’ she said. ‘You’ve time for this, haven’t you?’</p>
    <p>‘Uh-huh.’ Scott kissed her, a bit hesitantly. Up till this moment, the breaking with Jeana had seemed easy enough. She would raise no objections. That was the chief reason for free-marriage. However —</p>
    <p>She was sitting in the relaxer, sweetening the coffee, opening a fresh celopack of cigarettes. ‘Hung over?’</p>
    <p>‘No. I vitamized. Feel pretty good.’ Most bars had a vitamizing chamber to nullify the effects of too much stimulant. Scott was, in fact, feeling fresh and keenly alert. He was wondering how to broach the subject of Ilene to Jeana.</p>
    <p>She saved him the trouble.</p>
    <p>‘If it’s a girl, Brian, just take it easy. No use doing anything till this war’s over. How long will it take?’</p>
    <p>‘Oh, not long. A week at most. One battle may settle it, you know. The girl-‘</p>
    <p>‘She’s not a Keep girl.’</p>
    <p>‘Yes.’</p>
    <p>Jeana looked up, startled. ‘You’re crazy.’</p>
    <p>‘I started to tell you,’ Scott said impatiently. ‘It isn’t just - her. I’m sick of the Doones. I’m going to quit.’</p>
    <p>‘Hm-m-m. Like that?’</p>
    <p>‘Like that.’</p>
    <p>Jeana shook her head. ‘Keep women aren’t tough.’</p>
    <p>‘They don’t need to be. Their men aren’t soldiers.’</p>
    <p>‘Have it your own way. I’ll wait till you get back. Maybe I’ve got a hunch. You see, Brian, we’ve been together for five years. We fit. Not because of anything like philosophy or psychology-it’s a lot more personal. It’s just us. As man and woman, we get along comfortably. There’s love, too. Those close emotional feelings are more important, really, than the long view. You can get excited about futures, but you can’t live them.’</p>
    <p>Scott shrugged. ‘Could be I’m starting to forget about futures. Concentrating on Brian Scott.’</p>
    <p>‘More coffee … there. Well, for five years now I’ve gone with you from Keep to Keep, waiting every time you went off to war, wondering if you’d come back, knowing that I was just a part of your life, but - I sometimes thought - the most important part. Soldiering’s seventy-five per cent. I’m the other quarter. I think you need that quarter - you need the whole thing, in that proportion, actually. You could find another woman, but she’d have to be willing to take twenty-five per cent.’</p>
    <p>Scott didn’t answer. Jeana blew smoke through her nostrils.</p>
    <p>‘O.K., Brian. I’ll wait.’</p>
    <p>‘It isn’t the girl so much. She happens to fit into the pattern of what I want. You-‘</p>
    <p>‘I’d never be able to fit that pattern,’ Jeana said softly. ‘The Free Companions need women who are willing to be soldiers’ wives. Free-wives, if you like. Chiefly it’s a matter of not being too demanding. But there are other things. No, Brian. Even if you wanted that, I couldn’t make myself over into one of the Keep people. It wouldn’t be me. I wouldn’t respect myself, living a life that’d be false to me; and you wouldn’t like me that way either. I couldn’t and wouldn’t change. I’ll have to stay as I am. A soldier’s wife. As long as you’re a Dooneman, you’ll need me. But if you change -‘ She didn’t finish.</p>
    <p>Scott lit a cigarette, scowling. ‘It’s hard to know, exactly.’</p>
    <p>‘I may not understand you, but I don’t ask questions and I don’t try to change you. As long as you want that, you can have it from me. I’ve nothing else to offer you. It’s enough for a Free Companion. It’s not enough - or too much - for a Keep-dweller.’</p>
    <p>‘I'll miss you,’ he said.</p>
    <p>‘That’ll depend, too. I’ll miss you.’ Under the table her fingers writhed together, but her face did not change. ‘It’s getting late. Here, let me check your chronometer.’ Jeana leaned across the table, lifted Scott’s wrist, and compared his watch with the central-time clock on the wall. ‘O.K. On your way, soldier.’</p>
    <p>Scott stood up, tightening his belt. He bent to kiss Jeana, and, though she began to turn her face away, after a moment she raised her lips to his.</p>
    <p>They didn’t speak. Scott went out quickly, and the girl sat motionless, the cigarette smouldering out unheeded between her fingers. Somehow it did not matter so much, now, that Brian was leaving her for another woman and another life. As always, the one thing of real importance was that he was going into danger.</p>
    <p>Guard him from harm, she thought, not knowing that she was praying. Guard him from harm!</p>
    <p>And now there would be silence, and waiting. That, at least, had not changed. Her eyes turned to the clock.</p>
    <p>Already the minutes were longer.</p>

    </cite>
    <p>Commander Bienne was superintending the embarkation of the last Doonemen when Scott arrived at headquarters. He saluted the captain briskly, apparently untired by his night’s work of handling the transportation routine.</p>
    <p>‘All checked, sir.’</p>
    <p>Scott nodded. ‘Good. Is Cine Rhys here?’</p>
    <p>‘He just arrived.’ Bienne nodded toward a door-curtain. As Scott moved away, the other followed.</p>
    <p>‘What’s up, commander?’</p>
    <p>Bienne pitched his voice low. ‘Bronson’s laid up with endemic fever.’ He forgot to say ‘sir.’ ‘He was to handle the left wing of the fleet. I’d appreciate that job.’</p>
    <p>‘I'll see if I can do it.’</p>
    <p>Bienne’s lips tightened, but he said nothing more. He turned back to his men, and Scott went on into the cinc’s office. Rhys was at the telaudio. He looked up, his eyes narrowed.</p>
    <p>‘Morning, captain. I’ve just heard from Mendez.’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, sir?’</p>
    <p>‘He’s still holding out for a fifty per cent cut on the korium ransom from Virginia Keep. You’ll have to see him. Try and get the Mob for less than fifty if you can. Telaudio me from Mendez’s fort.’</p>
    <p>‘Check, sir.’</p>
    <p>‘Another thing. Bronson’s in sick bay.’</p>
    <p>‘I heard that. If I may suggest Commander Bienne to take his place at left-wing command -‘</p>
    <p>But Cine Rhys raised his hand. ‘Not this time. We can’t afford individualism. The commander tried to play a lone hand in the last war. You know we can’t risk it till he’s back in line - thinking of the Doones instead of Fredric Bienne.’</p>
    <p>‘He’s a good man, sir. A fine strategist.’</p>
    <p>‘But not yet a good integrating factor. Perhaps next time. Put Commander Geer on the left wing. Keep Bienne with you. He needs discipline. And - take a flitterboat to Mendez.’</p>
    <p>‘Not a plane?’</p>
    <p>‘One of the technicians just finished a new tight-beam camouflager for communications. I’m having it installed immediately on all our planes and gliders. Use the boat; it isn’t far to the Mob’s fort - that long peninsula on the coast of Southern Hell.’</p>
    <p>Even on the charts that continent was named Hell - for obvious reasons. Heat was only one of them. And, even with the best equipment, a party exploring the jungle there would soon find itself suffering the tortures of the damned. On the land of Venus, flora and fauna combined diabolically to make the place uninhabitable to Earthmen. Many of the plants even exhaled poisonous gases. Only the protected coastal forts of the Free Companies could exist - and that was because they were forts.</p>
    <p>Cine Rhys frowned at Scott. ‘We’ll use H-plan 7 if we can get the Mob. Otherwise we’ll have to fall back on another outfit, and I don’t want to do that. The Helldivers have too many subs, and we haven’t enough detectors. So do your damnedest.’</p>
    <p>Scott saluted. ‘I'll do that, sir.’ Rhys waved him away, and he went out into the next room, finding Commander Bienne alone. The officer turned an inquiring look toward him.</p>
    <p>‘Sorry,’ Scott said. ‘Geer gets the left-wing command this time.’</p>
    <p>Bienne’s sour face turned dark red. ‘I’m sorry I didn’t take a crack at you before mobilization,’ he said. ‘You hate competition, don’t you?’</p>
    <p>Scott’s nostrils flared. ‘If it had been up to me, you’d have got that command, Bienne.’</p>
    <p>‘Sure. I’ll bet. All right, captain. Where’s my bunk? A flitterboat?’</p>
    <p>‘You’ll be on right wing, with me. Control ship Flintlock.’</p>
    <p>‘With you. Under you, you mean,’ Bienne said tightly. His eyes were blazing. ‘Yeah.’</p>
    <p>Scott’s dark cheeks were flushed too. ‘Orders, commander,’ he snapped. ‘Get me a flitterboat pilot. I’m going topside.’</p>
    <p>Without a word Bienne turned to the telaudio. Scott, a tight, furious knot in his stomach, stamped out of headquarters, trying to fight down his anger. Bienne was a jackass. A lot he cared about the Doones —</p>
    <p>Scott caught himself and grinned sheepishly. Well, he cared little about the Doones himself. But while he was in the Company, discipline was important - integration with the smoothly running fighting machine. No place for individualism. One thing he and Bienne had in common; neither had any sentiment about the Company.</p>
    <p>He took a lift to the ceiling of the Dome. Beneath him Montana Keep dropped away, shrinking to doll size. Somewhere down there, he thought, was Ilene. He’d be back. Perhaps this war would be a short one - not that they were ever much longer than a week, except in unusual cases where a Company developed new strategies.</p>
    <p>He was conducted through an air lock into a bubble, a tough, transparent sphere with a central vertical core through which the cable ran. Except for Scott, the bubble was empty. After a moment it started up with a slight jar.</p>
    <p>Gradually the water outside the curving walls changed from black to deep green, and thence to translucent chartreuse. Sea creatures were visible, but they were nothing new to Scott; he scarcely saw them.</p>
    <p>The bubble broke surface. Since air pressure had been constant, there was no possibility of the bends, and Scott opened the panel and stepped out on one of the buoyant floats that dotted the water above Montana Keep. A few sightseers crowded into the chamber he had left, and presently it was drawn down, out of sight.</p>
    <p>In the distance Free Companions were embarking from a larger float to an air ferry. Scott glanced up with a weather eye. No storm, he saw, though the low ceiling was, as usual, torn and twisted into boiling currents by the winds. He remembered, suddenly, that the battle would probably take place over Venus Deep. That would make it somewhat harder for the gliders - there would be few of the thermals found, for instance, above the Sea of Shallows here.</p>
    <p>A flitterboat, low, fast, and beautifully manoeuvrable, shot in toward the quay. The pilot flipped back the overhead shell and saluted Scott. It was Norman Kane, looking shipshape in his tight-fitting grey uniform, and apparently ready to grin at the slightest provocation.</p>
    <p>Scott jumped lightly down into the craft and seated himself beside the pilot. Kane drew the transparent shell back over them. He looked at Scott.</p>
    <p>‘Orders, captain?’</p>
    <p>‘Know where the Mob’s fort is? Good. Head there. Fast.’</p>
    <p>Kane shot the flitterboat out from the float with a curtain of v-shaped spray rising from the bow. Drawing little water, manoeuvrable, incredibly fast, these tiny craft were invaluable in naval battle. It was difficult to hit one, they moved so fast. They had no armour to slow them down. They carried high-explosive bullets fired from small-calibre guns, and were, as a rule, two-man craft. They complemented the heavier ordnance of the battlewagons and destroyers.</p>
    <p>Scott handed Kane a cigarette. The boy hesitated.</p>
    <p>‘We’re not under fire,’ the captain chuckled. ‘Discipline clamps down during a battle, but it’s O.K. for you to have a smoke with me. Here!’ He lit the white tube for Kane.</p>
    <p>‘Thanks, sir. I guess I’m a bit-over-anxious.’</p>
    <p>‘Well, war has its rules. Not many, but they mustn’t be broken.’ Both men were silent for a while, watching the blank grey surface of the ocean ahead. A transport plane passed them, flying low.</p>
    <p>‘Is Ilene Kane your sister?’ Scott asked presently.</p>
    <p>Kane nodded. ‘Yes, sir.’</p>
    <p>‘Thought so. If she’d been a man, I imagine she’d have been a Free Companion.’</p>
    <p>The boy shrugged. ‘Oh, I don’t know. She doesn’t have the-I don’t know. She’d consider it too much effort. She doesn’t like discipline.’</p>
    <p>‘Do you?’</p>
    <p>‘It’s fighting that’s important to me, Sir.’ That was an afterthought, ‘Winning, really.’</p>
    <p>‘You can lose a battle even though you win it,’ Scott said rather sombrely.</p>
    <p>‘Well, I’d rather be a Free Companion than do anything else I know of. Not that I’ve had much experience-‘  ‘You’ve had experience of war with Starling’s outfit, but you probably learned some dangerous stuff at the same time. War isn’t swashbuckling piracy these days. If the Doones tried to win battles by that sort of thing, there’d be no more Doones in a week or so.’</p>
    <p>‘But-‘ Kane hesitated. ‘Isn’t that sort of thing rather necessary? Taking blind chances, I mean-‘</p>
    <p>‘There are desperate chances,’ Scott told him, ‘but there are no blind chances in war-not to a good soldier. When I was green in the service, I ran a cruiser out of the line to ram. I was demoted, for a very good reason. The enemy ship I rammed wasn’t as important to the enemy as bur cruiser was to us. If I’d stayed on course, I’d have helped sink three or four ships instead of disabling one and putting my cruiser out of action. It’s the great god integration we worship, Kane. It’s much more important now than it ever was on Earth, because the military has consolidated. Army, navy, air, undersea - they’re all part of one organization now. I suppose the only important change was in the air.’</p>
    <p>‘Gliders, you mean? I knew powered planes couldn’t be used in battle.”</p>
    <p>‘Not in the atmosphere of Venus,’ Scott agreed. ‘Once powered planes get up in the cloud strata, they’re fighting crosscurrents and pockets so much they’ve got no time to do accurate firing. If they’re armoured, they’re slow. If they’re light, detectors can spot them and anti-aircraft can smash them. Unpowered gliders are valuable not for bombing but for directing attacks. They get into the clouds, stay hidden, and use infra-red telecameras which are broadcast on a tight beam back to the control ships. They’re the eyes of the fleet. They can tell us-White water ahead, Kane! Swerve!’</p>
    <p>The pilot had already seen the ominous boiling froth foaming out in front of the bow. Instinctively he swung the flitterboat in a wrenching turn. The craft heeled sidewise, throwing its occupants almost out of their seats.</p>
    <p>‘Sea beast?’ Scott asked, and answered his own question. ‘No, not with those spouts. It’s volcanic. And it’s spreading fast.’</p>
    <p>‘I can circle it, sir,’ Kane suggested.</p>
    <p>Scott shook his head. ‘Too dangerous. Backtrack.’</p>
    <p>Obediently the boy sent the flitterboat racing out of the area of danger. Scott had been right about the extent of the danger; the boiling turmoil was widening almost faster than the tiny ship could flee. Suddenly the line of white water caught up with them. The flitterboat jounced like a chip, the wheel being nearly torn from Kane’s grip. Scott reached over and helped steady it. Even with two men handling the wheel, there was a possibility that it might wrench itself free. Steam rose in veils beyond the transparent shell. The water had turned a scummy brown under the froth.</p>
    <p>Kane jammed on the power. The flitterboat sprang forward like a ricocheting bullet, dancing over the surface of the seething waves. Once they plunged head-on into a swell, and a screaming of outraged metal vibrated through the craft. Kane, tight-lipped, instantly slammed in the auxiliary, cutting out the smashed motor unit. Then, unexpectedly, they were in clear water, cutting back toward Montana Keep.</p>
    <p>Scott grinned. ‘Nice handling. Lucky you didn’t try to circle. We’d never have made it.’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, sir.’ Kane took a deep breath. His eyes were bright with excitement.</p>
    <p>‘Circle now. Here.’ He thrust a lighted cigarette between the boy’s lips. ‘You’ll be a good Dooneman, Kane. Your reactions are good and fast.’</p>
    <p>‘Thanks, sir.’</p>
    <p>Scott smoked silently for a while. He glanced toward the north, but, with the poor visibility, he could not make out the towering range of volcanic peaks that were the backbone of Southern Hell. Venus was a comparatively young planet, the internal fires still bursting forth unexpectedly. Which was why no forts were ever built on islands - they had an unhappy habit of disappearing without warning!</p>
    <p>The flitterboat rode hard, at this speed, despite the insulating system of springs and shock absorbers. After a ride in one of these ‘spankers’ - the irreverent name the soldiers had for them - a man needed arnica if not a chiropractor. Scott shifted his weight on the soft air cushions under him, which felt like cement.</p>
    <p>Under his breath he hummed:</p>
    <p>‘It ain’t the ‘eavy ‘aulin’ that ‘urts the ‘arses’ ‘oofs, It’s the ‘ammer, ‘ammer, ‘ammer on the ‘ard ‘ighway!’</p>
    <p>The flitterboat scooted on, surrounded by monotonous sea and cloud, till finally the rampart of the coast grew before the bow, bursting suddenly from the fog-veiled horizon. Scott glanced at his chronometer and sighed with relief. They had made good time, in spite of the slight delay caused by the subsea volcano.</p>
    <p>The fortress of the Mob was a huge metal and stone castle on the tip of the peninsula. The narrow strip that separated it from the mainland had been cleared, and the pockmarks of shell craters showed where guns had driven back onslaughts from the jungle - the reptilian, ferocious giants of Venus, partially intelligent but absolutely intractable because of the gulf that existed between their methods of thinking and the culture of mankind. Overtures had been made often enough; but it had been found that the reptile-folk were better left alone. They would not parley. They were blindly bestial savages, with whom it was impossible to make truce. They stayed in the jungle, emerging only to hurl furious attacks at the forts - attacks doomed to failure, since fang and talon were matched against lead-jacketed bullet and high explosive.</p>
    <p>As the flitterboat shot into a jetty, Scott kept his eyes straight ahead - it was not considered good form for a Free Companion to seem too curious when visiting the fort of another Company. Several men were on the quay, apparently waiting for him. They saluted as Scott stepped out of the boat.</p>
    <p>He gave his name and rank. A corporal stepped forward.</p>
    <p>‘Cine Mendez is expecting you, sir. Cine Rhys telaudioed an hour or so back. If you’ll come this way-‘</p>
    <p>‘All right, corporal. My pilot-‘</p>
    <p>‘He’ll be taken care of, sir. A rubdown and a drink, perhaps, after a spanker ride.’</p>
    <p>Scott nodded and followed the other into the bastion that thrust out from the overhanging wall of the fort. The sea gate was open, and he walked swiftly through the courtyard in the corporal’s wake, passing a door-curtain, mounting an escalator, and finding himself, presently, before another curtain that bore the face of Cine Mendez, plump, hoglike, and bald as a bullet.</p>
    <p>Entering, he saw Mendez himself at the head of a long table, where nearly a dozen officers of the Mob were also seated. In person Mendez was somewhat more prepossessing than in effigy. He looked like a boar rather than a pig - a fighter, not a gourmand. His sharp black eyes seemed to drive into Scott with the impact of a physical blow.</p>
    <p>He stood up, his officers following suit. ‘Sit down, captain. There’s a place at the foot of the table. No reflections on rank, but I prefer to be face to face with the man I’m dealing with. But first-you just arrived? If you’d like a quick rubdown, we’ll be glad to wait.’</p>
    <p>Scott took his place. ‘Thank you, no, Cine Mendez. I’d prefer not to lose time.’</p>
    <p>‘Then we’ll waste none on introductions. However, you can probably stand a drink.’ He spoke to the orderly at the door, and presently a filled glass stood at Scott’s elbow.</p>
    <p>His quick gaze ran along the rows effaces. Good soldiers, he thought - tough, well trained, and experienced. They had been under fire. A small outfit, the Mob, but a powerful one.</p>
    <p>Cine Mendez sipped his own drink. ‘To business. The Doonsmen wish to hire our help in fighting the Helldivers. Virginia Keep has bought the services of the Helldivers to attack Montana Keep.’ He enumerated on stubby fingers. ‘You offer us fifty thousand cash and thirty-five per cent of the korium ransom. So?’</p>
    <p>‘That’s correct.’</p>
    <p>‘We ask fifty per cent.’</p>
    <p>‘It’s high. The Doones have superior manpower and equipment.’</p>
    <p>‘To us, not to the Helldivers. Besides, the percentage is contingent. If we should lose, we get only the cash payment.’</p>
    <p>Scott nodded. ‘That’s correct, but the only real danger from the Helldivers is their submarine corps. The Doones have plenty of surface and air equipment. We might lick the Helldivers without you.’</p>
    <p>‘I don’t think so.’ Mendez shook his bald head. ‘They have some new underwater torpedoes that make hash out of heavy armour plate. But we have new sub-detectors. We can blast the Helldivers’ subs for you before they get within torpedo range.’</p>
    <p>Scott said bluntly, ‘You’ve been stalling, Cine Mendez. We’re not that bad off. If we can’t get you, we’ll find another outfit.’</p>
    <p>‘With sub-detectors?’</p>
    <p>‘Yardley’s Company is good at undersea work.’</p>
    <p>A major near the head of the table spoke up. ‘That’s true, sir. They have suicide subs - not too dependable, but they have them.’</p>
    <p>Cine Mendez wiped his bald head with his palms in a slow circular motion. ‘Hm-m-m. Well, captain, I don’t know. Yardley’s Company isn’t as good as ours for this job.’</p>
    <p>‘All right,’ Scott said, ‘I’ve carte blanche. We don’t know how much korium Virginia Keep has in her vaults. How would this proposition strike you: the Mob gets fifty per cent of the korium ransom up to a quarter of a million; thirty-five per cent above that.’</p>
    <p>‘Forty-five.’</p>
    <p>‘Forty, above a quarter of a million; forty-five below that sum.’</p>
    <p>‘Gentlemen?’ Cine Mendez asked, looking down the table. ‘Your vote?’</p>
    <p>There were several ayes, and a scattering of nays. Mendez shrugged.</p>
    <p>‘Then I have the deciding vote. Very well. We get forty-five per cent of the Virginia Keep ransom up to a quarter of a million; forty per cent on any amount above that. Agreed. We’ll drink to it.’</p>
    <p>Orderlies served drinks. As Mendez rose, the others followed his example. The cine nodded to Scott.</p>
    <p>‘Will you propose a toast, captain?’</p>
    <p>‘With pleasure. Nelson’s toast, then - a willing foe and sea room!’</p>
    <p>They drank to that, as Free Companions had always drunk that toast on the eve of battle. As they seated themselves once more, Mendez said, ‘Major Matson, please telaudio Cine Rhys and arrange details. We must know his plans.’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, sir.’</p>
    <p>Mendez glanced at Scott. ‘Now how else may I serve you?’</p>
    <p>‘Nothing else. I’ll get back to our fort. Details can be worked out on the telaudio, on tight beam.’</p>
    <p>‘If you’re going back in that flitterboat,’ Mendez said sardonically, ‘I strongly advise a rubdown. There’s time to spare, now we’ve come to an agreement.’</p>
    <p>Scott hesitated. ‘Very well. I’m … uh … starting to ache.’ He stood up. ‘Oh, one thing I forgot. We’ve heard rumours that Starling’s outfit is using atomic power.’</p>
    <p>Mendez’s mouth twisted into a grimace of distaste. ‘Hadn’t heard that. Know anything about it, gentlemen?’</p>
    <p>Heads were shaken. One officer said, ‘I’ve heard a little talk about it, but only talk, so far.’</p>
    <p>Mendez said, ‘After this war, we’ll investigate further. If there’s truth in the story, we’ll join you, of course, in mopping up the Starlings. No court-martial is necessary for that crime!’</p>
    <p>‘Thanks. I’ll get in touch with other Companies and see what they’ve heard. Now, if you’ll excuse me -‘</p>
    <p>He saluted and went out, exultation flaming within him. The bargain had been a good one - for the Doonemen badly needed the Mob’s help against the Helldivers. Cine Rhys would be satisfied with the arrangement.</p>
    <p>An orderly took him to the baths, where a rubdown relaxed his aching muscles. Presently he was on the quay again, climbing into the flitterboat. A glance behind him showed that the gears of war were beginning to grind. There was little he could see, but men were moving about through the courtyard with purposeful strides, to the shops, to administration, to the laboratories. The battlewagons were anchored down the coast, Scott knew, in a protected bay, but they would soon move out to their rendezvous with the Doones.</p>
    <p>Kane, at the controls of the flitterboat, said, ‘They repaired the auxiliary unit for us, sir.’</p>
    <p>‘Courtesies of the trade.’ Scott lifted a friendly hand to the men on the quay as the boat slid toward open water. ‘The Doone fort, now. Know it?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, sir. Are … are the Mob fighting with us, if I may ask?’</p>
    <p>‘They are. And they’re a grand lot of fighters. You’re going to see action, Kane. When you hear battle stations next, it’s going to mean one of the sweetest scraps that happened on Venus. Push down that throttle - we’re in a hurry!’</p>
    <p>The flitterboat raced southwest at top speed, its course marked by the flying V of spray.</p>
    <p>‘One last fight,’ Scott thought to himself. Tm glad it’s going to be a good one.’</p>

    <p>The motor failed when they were about eight miles from the Doone fort.</p>
    <p>It was a catastrophe rather than merely a failure. The overstrained and overheated engine, running at top speed, blew back. The previous accident, at the subsea volcano, had brought out hidden flaws in the alloy which the Mob’s repair men had failed to detect, when they replaced the smashed single unit. Sheer luck had the flitterboat poised on a swell when the crack-up happened. The engine blew out and down, ripping the bow to shreds. Had they been bow-deep, the blast would have been unfortunate for Scott and the pilot-more so than it was.</p>
    <p>They were perhaps a half mile from the shore. Scott was deafened by the explosion and simultaneously saw the horizon swinging in a drunken swoop. The boat turned turtle, the shell smacking into water with a loud cracking sound. But the plastic held. Both men were tangled together on what had been their ceiling, sliding forward as the flitterboat began to sink bow first. Steam sizzled from the ruined engine.</p>
    <p>Kane managed to touch one of the emergency buttons.</p>
    <p>The shell was, of course, jammed, but a few of the segments slid aside, admitting a gush of acrid sea water. For a moment they struggled there, fighting the crosscurrents till the air had been displaced. Scott, peering through cloudy green gloom, saw Kane’s dark shadow twist and kick out through a gap. He followed.</p>
    <p>Beneath him the black hulk of the boat dropped slowly and was gone. His head broke surface, and he gasped for breath, shaking droplets from his lashes and granting around. Where was Kane?</p>
    <p>The boy appeared, his helmet gone, sleek hair plastered to his forehead. Scott caught his eye and pulled the trigger on his life vest, the inflatable undergarment which was always worn under the blouse on sea duty. As chemicals mixed, light gas rushed into the vest, lifting Scott higher in the water. He felt the collar cushion inflate against the back of his head-the skull-fitting pillow that allowed shipwrecked men to float and rest without danger of drowning in their sleep. But he had no need for this now.</p>
    <p>Kane, he saw, had triggered his own life vest. Scott hurled himself up, searching for signs of life. There weren’t any. The grey-green sea lay desolate to the misty horizon. A half mile away was a mottled chartreuse wall that marked the jungle. Above and beyond that dim sulphurous red lit the clouds.</p>
    <p>Scott got out his leaf-bladed smatchet, gesturing for Kane to do the same. The boy did not seem worried. No doubt this was merely an exciting adventure for him, Scott thought wryly. Oh, well.</p>
    <p>Gripping the smatchet between his teeth, the captain began to swim shoreward. Kane kept at his side. Once Scott warned his companion to stillness and bent forward, burying his face in the water and peering down at a great dim shadow that coiled away and was gone - a sea snake, but, luckily, not hungry. The oceans of Venus were perilous with teeming, ferocious life. Precautions were fairly useless. When a man was once in the water, it was up to him to get out of it as rapidly as possible.</p>
    <p>Scott touched a small cylinder attached to his belt and felt bubbles rushing against his palm. He was slightly relieved. When he had inflated the vest, his tube of compressed gas had automatically begun to release, sending out a foul-smelling vapour that permeated the water for some distance around. The principle was that of the skunk adjusted to the environment of the squid, and dangerous undersea life was supposed to be driven away by the Mellison tubes; but it didn’t work with carrion eaters like the snakes. Scott averted his nose. The gadgets were named Mellison tubes, but the men called them Stinkers, a far more appropriate term.</p>
    <p>Tides on Venus are unpredictable. The clouded planet has no moon, but it is closer to the Sun than Earth. As a rule the tides are mild, except during volcanic activity, when tidal waves sweep the shores. Scott, keeping a weather eye out for danger, rode the waves in toward the beach, searching the strip of dull blackness for signs of life.</p>
    <p>Nothing.</p>
    <p>He scrambled out at last, shaking himself like a dog, and instantly changed the clip in his automatic for high explosive. The weapon, of course, was watertight - a necessity on Venus. As Kane sat down with a grunt and deflated his vest, Scott stood eyeing the wall of jungle thirty feet away. It stopped there abruptly, for nothing could grow on black sand.</p>
    <p>The rush and whisper of the waves made the only sound. Most of the trees were liana-like, ekeing out a precarious existence, as the saying went, by taking in each other’s washing. The moment one of them showed signs of solidity, it was immediately assailed by parasitic vines flinging themselves madly upward to reach the filtered sunlight of Venus. The leaves did not begin for thirty feet above the ground; they made a regular roof up there, lying like crazy shingles, and would have shut out all light had they not been of light translucent green. Whitish tendrils crawled like reaching serpents from tree to tree, tentacles of vegetable octopi. There were two types of Venusian fauna: the giants who could crash through the forest, and the supple, small ground-dwellers- insects and reptiles mostly-who depended on poison sacs for self-protection. Neither kind was pleasant company.</p>
    <p>There were flying creatures, too, but these lived in the upper strata, among the leaves. And there were ambiguous horrors that lived in the deep mud and the stagnant pools under the forest, but no one knew much about these.</p>
    <p>‘Well,’ Scott said, ‘that’s that.’</p>
    <p>Kane nodded. ‘I guess I should have checked the motors.’</p>
    <p>‘You wouldn’t have found anything. Latent flaws - it would have taken black night to bring ‘em out. Just one of those things. Keep your gas mask handy, now. If we get anywhere near poison flowers and the wind’s blowing this way, we’re apt to keel over like that.’ Scott opened a waterproof wallet and took out a strip of sensitized litmus, which he clipped to his wrist. ‘If this turns blue, that means gas, even if we don’t smell it.’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, sir. What now?’</p>
    <p>‘We-ell- the boat’s gone. We can’t telaudio for help.’ Scott fingered the blade of his smatchet and slipped it into the belt sheath. ‘We head for the fort. Eight miles. Two hours, if we can stick to the beach and if we don’t run into trouble. More than that if Signal Rock’s ahead of us, because we’ll have to detour inland in that case.’ He drew out a collapsible single-lenser telescope and looked southwest along the shore. ‘Uh-huh. We detour.’</p>
    <p>A breath of sickening sweetness gusted down from the jungle roof. From above, Scott knew, the forest looked surprisingly lovely. It always reminded him of an antique candlewick spread he had once bought Jeana - immense rainbow flowers scattered over a background of pale green. Even among the flora competition was keen; the plants vied in producing colours and scents that would attract the winged carriers of pollen.</p>
    <p>There would always be frontiers, Scott thought. But they might remain unconquered for a long time, here on Venus. The Keeps were enough for the undersea folk; they were self-sustaining. And the Free Companions had no need to carve out empires on the continents. They were fighters, not agrarians. Land hunger was no longer a part of the race. It might come again, but not in the time of the Keeps.</p>
    <p>The jungles of Venus held secrets he would never know. Men can conquer lands from the air, but they cannot hold them by that method. It would take a long, slow period of encroachment, during which the forest and all it represented would be driven back, step by painful step - and that belonged to a day to come, a time Scott would not know. The savage world would be tamed. But not now-not yet.</p>
    <p>At the moment it was untamed and very dangerous. Scott stripped off his tunic and wrung water from it. His clothing would not dry in this saturated air, despite the winds. His trousers clung to him stickily, clammy coldness in their folds.</p>
    <p>‘Ready, Kane?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, sir.’</p>
    <p>‘Then let’s go.’</p>
    <p>They went southwest, along the beach, at a steady, easy lope that devoured miles. Speed and alertness were necessary in equal proportion. From time to time Scott scanned the sea with his telescope, hoping to sight a vessel. He saw nothing. The ships would be in harbour, readying for the battle; and planes would be grounded for installation of the new telaudio device Cine Rhys had mentioned.</p>
    <p>Signal Rock loomed ahead, an outthrust crag with eroded, unscalable sides towering two hundred feet and more. The black strip of sand ended there. From the rock there was a straight drop into deep water, cut up by a turmoil of currents. It was impossible to take the sea detour; there was nothing else for it but to swerve inland, a dangerous but inevitable course. Scott postponed the plunge as long as possible, till the scarp of Signal Rock, jet black with leprous silvery patches on its surface, barred the way. With a quizzical look at Kane he turned sharply to his right and headed for the jungle.</p>
    <p>‘Half a mile of forest equals a hundred miles of beach hiking,’ he remarked.</p>
    <p>‘That bad, sir? I’ve never tackled it.’</p>
    <p>‘Nobody does, unless they have to. Keep your eyes open and your gun ready. Don’t wade through water, even when you can see bottom. There are some little devils that are pretty nearly transparent - vampire fish. If a few of those fasten on you, you’ll need a transfusion in less than a minute. I wish the volcanoes would kick up a racket. The beasties generally lie low when that happens.’</p>
    <p>Under a tree Scott stopped, seeking a straight, long limb. It took a while to find a suitable one, in that tangle of coiling lianas, but finally he succeeded, using his smatchet blade to hack himself a light five-foot pole. Kane at his heels, he moved on into the gathering gloom.</p>
    <p>‘We may be stalked,’ he told the boy. ‘Don’t forget to guard the rear.’</p>
    <p>The sand had given place to sticky whitish mud that plastered the men to their calves before a few moments had passed. A patina of slickness seemed to overlay the ground. The grass was coloured so much like the mud itself that it was practically invisible, except by its added slipperiness. Scott slowly advanced, keeping close to the wall of rock on his left where the tangle was not so thick. Nevertheless he had to use the smatchet more than once to cut a passage through vines.</p>
    <p>He stopped, raising his hand, and the squelch of Kane’s feet in the mud paused. Silently Scott pointed. Ahead of them in the cliff base was the mouth of a burrow.</p>
    <p>The captain bent down, found a small stone, and threw it toward the den. He waited, one hand lightly on his gun, ready to see something flash out of that burrow and race toward them. In the utter silence a new sound made itself heard-tiny goblin drums, erratic and resonant in a faraway fashion. Water, dropping from leaf to leaf, in the soaked jungle ceiling above them. Tink, link, tink-tink, link, tink-tink -</p>
    <p>‘O.K.,’ Scott said quietly. ‘Watch it, though.’ He went on, gun drawn, till they were level with the mouth of the burrow. ‘Turn, Kane. Keep your eye on it till I tell you to stop.’ He gripped the boy’s arm and guided him, bolstering his own weapon. The pole, till now held between biceps and body, slipped into his hand. He used it to probe the slick surface of the mud ahead. Sinkholes and quicksands were frequent, and so were traps, camouflaged pits built by mud-wolves - which, of course, were not wolves, and belonged to no known genus. On Venus, the fauna had more subdivisions than on old Earth, and lines of demarcation were more subtle.</p>
    <p>‘All right now.’</p>
    <p>Kane, sighing with relief, turned his face forward again. ‘What was it?’</p>
    <p>‘You never know what may come out of those holes,’ Scott told him. ‘They come fast, and they’re usually poisonous. So you can’t take chances with the critters. Slow down here. I don’t like the looks of that patch ahead.’</p>
    <p>Clearings were unusual in the forest. There was one here, twenty feet wide, slightly saucer-shaped. Scott gingerly extended the pole and probed. A faint ripple shook the white mud, and almost before it had appeared the captain had unholstered his pistol and was blasting shot after shot at the movement.</p>
    <p>‘Shoot, Kane!’ he snapped. ‘Quick! Shoot at it!’</p>
    <p>Kane obeyed, though he had to guess at his target. Mud geysered up, suddenly crimson-stained. Scott, still firing, gripped the boy’s arm and ran him back at a breakneck pace.</p>
    <p>The echoes died. Once more the distant elfin drums whispered through the green gloom.</p>
    <p>‘We got it,’ Scott said, after a pause.</p>
    <p>‘We did?’ the other asked blankly. ‘What -‘</p>
    <p>‘Mud-wolf, I think. The only way to kill those things is to get ‘em before they get out of the mud. They’re fast and they die hard. However-‘ He warily went forward. There was nothing to see. The mud had collapsed into a deeper saucer, but the holes blasted by the high-x bullets had filled in. Here and there were traces of thready crimson.</p>
    <p>‘Never a dull moment,’ Scott remarked. His crooked grin eased the tension. Kane chuckled and followed the captain’s example in replacing his half-used clip with a full one.</p>
    <p>The narrow spine of Signal Rock extended inland for a quarter mile before it became scalable. They reached that point finally, helping each other climb, and finding themselves, at the summit, still well below the leafy ceiling of the trees. The black surface of the rock was painfully hot, stinging their palms as they climbed, and even striking through their shoe soles.</p>
    <p>‘Halfway point, captain?’</p>
    <p>‘Yeah. But don’t let that cheer you. It doesn’t get any better till we hit the beach again. We’ll probably need some fever shots when we reach the fort, just in case. Oh-oh, Mask, Kane, quick.’ Scott lifted his arm. On his wrist the band of litmus had turned blue.</p>
    <p>With trained accuracy they donned the respirators. Scott felt a faint stinging on his exposed skin, but that wasn’t serious. Still, it would be painful later. He beckoned to Kane, slid down the face of the rock, used the pole to test the mud below, and jumped lightly. He dropped in the sticky whiteness and rolled over hastily, plastering himself from head to foot. Kane did the same. Mud wouldn’t neutralize the poison flowers’ gas, but it would absorb most of it before it reached the skin.</p>
    <p>Scott headed toward the beach, a grotesque figure. Mud dripped on the eye plate, and he scrubbed it away with a handful of white grass. He used the pole constantly to test the footing ahead.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless the mud betrayed him. The pole broke through suddenly, and as Scott automatically threw his weight back, the ground fell away under his feet. He had time for a crazy feeling of relief that this was quicksand, not a mud-wolf’s den, and then the clinging, treacherous stuff had sucked him down knee-deep. He fell back, keeping his grip on the pole and swinging the other end in an arc toward Kane.</p>
    <p>The boy seized it in both hands and threw himself flat. His foot hooked over an exposed root. Scott, craning his neck at a painfully awkward angle and trying to see through the mud-smeared vision plates, kept a rat-trap grip on his end of the pole, hoping its slickness would not slip through his fingers.</p>
    <p>He was drawn down farther, and then Kane’s anchorage began to help. The boy tried to pull the pole toward him, hand over hand. Scott shook his head. He was a good deal stronger than Kane, and the latter would need all his strength to keep a tight grip on the pole.</p>
    <p>Something stirred in the shadows behind Kane. Scott instinctively let go with one hand, and, with the other, got out his gun. It had a sealed mechanism, so the mud hadn’t harmed the firing, and the muzzle had a one-way trap. He fired at the movement behind Kane, heard a muffled tumult, and waited till it had died. The boy, after a startled look behind him, had not stirred.</p>
    <p>After that, rescue was comparatively easy. Scott simply climbed along the pole, spreading his weight over the surface of the quicksand. The really tough part was pulling his legs free of that deadly grip. Scott had to rest for five minutes after that.</p>
    <p>But he got out. That was the important thing.</p>
    <p>Kane pointed inquiringly into the bushes where the creature had been shot, but Scott shook his head. The nature of the beast wasn’t a question worth deciding, as long as it was apparently hors de combat. Readjusting his mask, Scott turned toward the beach, circling the quicksand, and Kane kept at his heels.</p>
    <p>Their luck had changed. They reached the shore with no further difficulty and collapsed on the black sand to rest. Presently Scott used a litmus, saw that the gas had dissipated, and removed his mask. He took a deep breath.</p>
    <p>‘Thanks, Kane,’ he said. ‘You can take a dip now if you want to wash off that mud. But stay close inshore. No, don’t strip. There’s no time.’</p>
    <p>The mud clung like glue and the black sand scratched like pumice. Still, Scott felt a good deal cleaner after a few minutes in the surf, while Kane stayed on guard. Slightly refreshed, they resumed the march.</p>
    <p>An hour later a convoy plane, testing, sighted them, telaudioed the fort, and a flitterboat came racing out’to pick them up. What Scott appreciated most of all was the stiff shot of uisqueplus the pilot gave him.</p>
    <p>Yeah. It was a dog’s life, all right!</p>
    <p>He passed the flask to Kane.</p>
    <p>Presently the fort loomed ahead, guarding Doone harbour. Large as the landlocked bay was, it could scarcely accommodate the fleet. Scott watched the activity visible with an approving eye. The flitterboat rounded the sea wall, built for protection against tidal waves, and shot toward a jetty. Its almost inaudible motor died: the shell swung back.</p>
    <p>Scott got out, beckoning to an orderly.</p>
    <p>‘Yes, sir?’</p>
    <p>‘See that this soldier gets what he needs. We’ve been in the jungle.’</p>
    <p>The man didn’t whistle sympathetically, but his mouth pursed. He saluted and helped Kane climb out of the flitterboat. As Scott hurried along the quay, he could hear an outburst of friendly profanity from the men on the dock, gathering around Kane.</p>
    <p>He nodded imperceptibly. The boy would make a good Free Companion - always granted that he could stand the gaff under fire. That was the acid test. Discipline was tightened then to the snapping point. If it snapped - well, the human factor always remained a variable, in spite of all the psychologists could do.</p>
    <p>He went directly to his quarters, switching on the telaudio to call Cine Rhys. The cine’s seamed, leathery face resolved itself on the screen.</p>
    <p>‘Captain Scott reporting for duty, sir.’</p>
    <p>Rhys looked at him sharply. ‘What happened?’</p>
    <p>‘Flitterboat crack-up. Had to make it in here on foot.’</p>
    <p>The cine called on his God in a mild voice. ‘Glad you made it. Any accident?’</p>
    <p>‘No, sir. The pilot’s unharmed, too. I’m ready to take over, after I’ve cleaned up.’</p>
    <p>‘Better take a rejuvenation - you probably need it. Everything’s going like clockwork. You did a good job with Mendez - a better bargain than I’d hoped for. I’ve been talking with him on the telaudio, integrating our forces. We’ll go into that later, though. Clean up and then make general inspection.’</p>
    <p>‘Check, sir.’</p>
    <p>Rhys clicked off. Scott turned to face his orderly.</p>
    <p>‘Hello, Briggs. Help me off with these duds. You’ll probably have to cut ‘em off.’</p>
    <p>‘Glad to see you back, sir. I don’t think it’ll be necessary to cut-‘ Blunt fingers flew deftly over zippers and clasps. ‘You were in the jungle?’</p>
    <p>Scott grinned wryly. ‘Do I look as if I’d been gliding?’</p>
    <p>‘Not all the way, sir - no.’</p>
    <p>Briggs was like an old bulldog - one of those men who proved the truth of the saying: ‘Old soldiers never die; they only fade away.’ Briggs could have been pensioned off ten years ago, but he hadn’t wanted that. There was always a place for old soldiers in the Free Companies, even those who were unskilled. Some became technicians; others military instructors; the rest, orderlies. The forts were their homes. Had they retired to one of the Keeps, they would have died for lack of interests.</p>
    <p>Briggs, now - he had never risen above the ranks, and knew nothing of military strategy, ordnance, or anything except plain righting. But he had been a Dooneman for forty years, twenty-five of them on active service. He was sixty-odd now, his squat figure slightly stooped like an elderly bear, his ugly face masked with scar tissue.</p>
    <p>‘All right. Start the shower, will you?’</p>
    <p>Briggs stumped off, and Scott, stripped of his filthy, sodden garments, followed. He luxuriated under the stinging spray, first hot soapy water, then alcomix, and after that plain water, first hot, then cold. That was the last task he had to do himself. Briggs took over, as Scott relaxed on the slab, dropping lotion into the captain’s burning eyes, giving him a deft but murderous rubdown, combining osteopathic and chiropractic treatment, adjusting revitalizing lamps, and measuring a hypo shot to nullify fatigue toxins. When the orderly was finished, Scott was ready to resume his duties with a clear brain and a refreshed body.</p>
    <p>Briggs appeared with fresh clothing. ‘I'll have the old uniform cleaned, sir. No use throwing it away.’</p>
    <p>‘You can’t clean that,’ Scott remarked, slipping into a singlet. ‘Not after I rolled in mud. But suit yourself. I won’t be needing it for long.’</p>
    <p>The orderly’s fingers, buttoning Scott’s tunic, stopped briefly and then resumed their motion. ‘Is that so, sir?’</p>
    <p>‘Yeah. I’m taking out discharge papers.’</p>
    <p>‘Another Company, sir?’</p>
    <p>‘Don’t get on your high horse,’ Scott told the orderly. ‘It’s not that. What would you do if it were? Court-martial me yourself and shoot me at sunrise?’</p>
    <p>‘No, sir. Begging your pardon, sir, I’d just think you were crazy.’</p>
    <p>‘Why I stand you only the Lord knows,’ Scott remarked. ‘You’re too damn independent. There’s no room for new ideas in that plastic skull of yours. You’re the quintessence of dogmatism.’</p>
    <p>Briggs nodded. ‘Probably, sir. When a man’s lived by one set of rules for as long as I have, and those rules work out, I suppose he might get dogmatic.’</p>
    <p>‘Forty years for you - about twelve for me.’</p>
    <p>‘You came up fast, captain. You’ll be cine here yet.’</p>
    <p>‘That’s what you think.’</p>
    <p>‘You’re next in line after Cine Rhys.’</p>
    <p>‘But I’ll be out of the Doones,’ Scott pointed out. ‘Keep that under your belt, Briggs.’</p>
    <p>The orderly grunted. ‘Can’t see it, sir. If you don’t join another Company, where’ll you go?’</p>
    <p>‘Ever heard of the Keeps?’</p>
    <p>Briggs permitted himself a respectful snort. ‘Sure. They’re fine for a binge, but -‘</p>
    <p>‘I’m going to live in one. Montana Keep.’</p>
    <p>‘The Keeps were built with men and machines. I helped at the building of Doone fort. Blood’s mixed with the plastic here. We had to hold back the jungle while the technicians were working. Eight months, sir, and never a day passed without some sort of attack. And attacks always meant casualties then. We had only breastworks. The ships laid down a barrage, but barrages aren’t impassable. That was a fight, captain.’</p>
    <p>Scott thrust out a leg so that Briggs could lace his boots. ‘And a damn good one. I know.’ He looked down at the orderly’s baldish, brown head where white hairs straggled.</p>
    <p>‘You know, but you weren’t there, captain. I was. First we dynamited. We cleared a half circle where we could dig in behind breastworks. Behind us were the techs, throwing up a plastic wall as fast as they could. The guns were brought in on barges. Lying offshore were the battlewagons. We could hear the shells go whistling over our heads-it sounded pretty good, because we knew things were O.K. as long as the barrage kept up. But it couldn’t be kept up day and night. The jungle broke through. For months the smell of blood hung here, and that drew the enemy.’</p>
    <p>‘But you held them off.’</p>
    <p>‘Sure, we did. Addison Doone was cine then - he’d formed the Company years before, but we hadn’t a fort. Doone fought with us. Saved my life once, in fact. Anyhow - we got the fort built, or rather the techs did. I won’t forget the kick I got out of it when the first big gun blasted off from the wall behind us. There was a lot to do after that, but when that shell was fired, we knew we’d done the job.’</p>
    <p>Scott nodded. ‘You feel a proprietary interest in the fort, I guess.’</p>
    <p>Briggs looked puzzled. ‘The fort? Why, that doesn’t mean much, captain. There are lots of forts. It’s something more than that; I don’t quite know what it is. It’s seeing the fleet out there - breaking in the rookies - giving the old toasts at mess - knowing that-‘ He stopped, at a loss.</p>
    <p>Scott’s lips twisted wryly.</p>
    <p>‘You don’t really know, do you, Briggs?’</p>
    <p>‘Know what, sir?’</p>
    <p>‘Why you stay here. Why you can’t believe I’d quit.’</p>
    <p>Briggs gave a little shrug. ‘Well - it’s the Doohes,’ he said. ‘That’s all, captain. It’s just that.’</p>
    <p>‘And what the devil will it matter, in a few hundred years?’</p>
    <p>‘I suppose it won’t. No, sir. But it isn’t our business to think about that. We’re Doonemen, that’s all.’</p>
    <p>Scott didn’t answer. He could easily have pointed out the fallacy of Briggs’ argument, but what was the use? He stood up, the orderly whisking invisible dust off his tunic.</p>
    <p>‘All set, sir. Shipshape.’</p>
    <p>‘Check, Briggs. Well, I’ve one more scrap, anyhow. I’ll bring you back a souvenir, eh?’</p>
    <p>The orderly saluted, grinning. Scott went out, feeling good. Inwardly he was chuckling rather sardonically at the false values he was supposed to take seriously. Of course many men had died when Doone fort had been built. But did that, in itself, make a tradition? What good was the fort? In a few centuries it would have outlived its usefulness. Then it would be a relic of the past. Civilization moved on, and, these days, civilization merely tolerated the military.</p>
    <p>So - what was the use? Sentiment needed a valid reason for its existence. The Free Companions fought, bitterly, doggedly, with insane valour, in order to destroy themselves. The ancient motives for war had vanished.</p>
    <p>What-was the use? All over Venus the lights of the great forts were going out - and, this time, they would never be lit again-not in a thousand lifetimes!</p>

     <p>And we are here as on a darkling plain</p>
     <p>Swept with confused alarms of “struggle and flight,</p>
     <p>Where ignorant armies clash by night.</p>
     <p>-Arnold circa 1870</p>
    </cite>
    <p>The fort was a completely self-contained unit, military rather than social. There was no need for any agrarian development, since a state of complete siege never existed. Food could be brought in from the Keeps by water and air.</p>
    <p>But military production was important, and, in the life of the fort, the techs played an important part, from the experimental physicist to the spot welder. There were always replacements to be made, for, in battle, there were always casualties. And it was necessary to keep the weapons up to date, continually striving to perfect new ones. But strategy and armament were of equal importance. An outnumbered fleet had been known to conquer a stronger one by the use of practical psychology.</p>
    <p>Scott found Commander Bienne at the docks, watching the launching of a new sub. Apparently Bienne hadn’t yet got over his anger, for he turned a scowling, sombre face to the captain as he saluted.</p>
    <p>‘Hello, commander,’ Scott said. ‘I’m making inspection. Are you free?’</p>
    <p>Bienne nodded. ‘There’s not much to do.’</p>
    <p>‘Well - routine. We got that sub finished just in time, eh?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes.’ Bienne couldn’t repress his pleasure at the sight of the trim, sleek vessel beginning to slide down the ways. Scott, too, felt his pulses heighten as the sub slipped into the water, raising a mighty splash, and then settling down to a smooth, steady riding on the waves. He looked out to where the great battlewagons stood at anchor, twelve of them, grey-green monsters of plated metal. Each of them carried launching equipment for gliders, but the collapsible aircraft were stowed away out of sight as yet. Smaller destroyers lay like</p>
    <p>lean-flanked wolves among the battleships. There were two fast carriers, loaded with gliders and flitterboats. There were torpedo boats and one low-riding monitor, impregnable, powerfully armed, but slow. Only a direct hit could disable a monitor, but the behemoths had their disadvantages. The battle was usually over before they lumbered into sight. Like all monitors, this one - the Armageddon - was constructed on the principle of a razorback hog, covered, except for the firing ports, by a tureen-shaped shield, strongly braced from within. The Armageddon was divided into groups of compartments and had several auxiliary engines, so that, unlike the legendary Rover, when a monitor died, it did not die all over. It was, in effect, a dinosaur. You could blow off the monster’s head, and it would continue to fight with talons and lashing tail. Its heavy guns made up in mobility for the giant’s unwieldiness - but the trouble was to get the monitor into battle. It was painfully slow.</p>
    <p>Scott scowled. ‘We’re fighting over Venus Deep, eh?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes,’ Bienne nodded. ‘That still goes. The Helldivers are already heading toward Montana Keep and we’ll intercept them over the Deep.’</p>
    <p>‘When’s zero hour?’</p>
    <p>‘Midnight tonight.’</p>
    <p>Scott closed his eyes, visualizing their course on a mental chart. Not so good. When battle was joined near island groups, it was sometimes possible for a monitor to slip up under cover of the islets, but that trick wouldn’t work now. Too bad - for the Helldivers were a strong outfit, more so since their recent merger with O’Brien’s Legion. Even with the Mob to help, the outcome of the scrap would be anyone’s guess. The Armageddon might be the decisive factor.</p>
    <p>‘I wonder-‘ Scott said. ‘No. It’d be impossible.’</p>
    <p>‘What?’</p>
    <p>‘Camouflaging the Armageddon. If the Helldivers see the monitor coming, they’ll lead the fight away from it, faster than that tub can follow. I was thinking we might get her into the battle without the enemy realizing it.’</p>
    <p>‘She’s camouflaged now.’</p>
    <p>‘Paint, that’s all. She can be spotted. I had some screwy idea about disguising her as an island or a dead whale.’</p>
    <p>‘She’s too big for a whale and floating islands look a bit suspicious.’</p>
    <p>‘Yeah. But if we could slip the Armageddon in without scaring off the enemy - Hm-m-m. Monitors have a habit of turning turtle, don’t they?’</p>
    <p>‘Right. They’re top-heavy. But a monitor can’t fight upside-down. It’s not such a bright idea, captain.’ Briefly Bienne’s sunken eyes gleamed with sneering mockery. Scott grunted and turned away.</p>
    <p>‘All right. Let’s take a look around.’</p>
    <p>The fleet was shipshape. Scott went to the shops. He learned that several new hulls were under way, but would not be completed by zero hour. With Bienne, he continued to the laboratory offices. Nothing new. No slip-ups; no surprises. The machine was running smoothly.</p>
    <p>By the time inspection was completed, Scott had an idea. He told Bienne to carry on and went to find Cine Rhys. The cine was in his office, just clicking off the telaudio as Scott appeared.</p>
    <p>‘That was Mendez,’ Rhys said. ‘The Mob’s meeting our fleet a hundred miles off the coast. They’ll be under our orders, of course. A good man, Mendez, but I don’t entirely trust him.’</p>
    <p>‘You’re not thinking of a double cross, sir?’</p>
    <p>Cine Rhys made disparaging noises. ‘Brutus is an honourable man. No, he’ll stick to his bargain. But I wouldn’t cut cards with Mendez. As a Free Companion, he’s trustworthy. Personally-Well, how do things look?’</p>
    <p>‘Very good, sir. I’ve an idea about the Armageddon.’</p>
    <p>‘I wish I had,’ Rhys said frankly. ‘We can’t get that damned scow into the battle in any way I can figure out. The Helldivers will see it coming, and lead the fight away.’</p>
    <p>‘I’m thinking of camouflage.’</p>
    <p>‘A monitor’s a monitor. It’s unmistakable. You can’t make it look like anything else.’</p>
    <p>‘With one exception, sir. You can make it look like a disabled monitor.’</p>
    <p>Rhys sat back, giving Scott a startled glance. ‘That’s interesting. Go on.’</p>
    <p>‘Look here, sir.’ The captain used a stylo to sketch the outline of a monitor on a convenient pad. ‘Above the surface, the Armageddon’s dome-shaped. Below, it’s a bit different, chiefly because of the keel. Why can’t we put a fake superstructure on the monitor - build a false keel on it, so it’ll seem capsized?’</p>
    <p>‘It’s possible.’</p>
    <p>‘Everybody knows a monitor’s weak spot - that it turns turtle under fire sometimes. If the Helldivers saw an apparently capsized Armageddon drifting toward them, they’d naturally figure the tub was disabled.’</p>
    <p>‘It’s crazy,’ Rhys said. ‘One of those crazy ideas that might work.’ He used the local telaudio to issue crisp orders. ‘Got it? Good. Get the Armageddon under way as soon as the equipment’s aboard. Alterations will be made at sea. We can’t waste time. If we had them made in the yards, she’d never catch up with the fleet.’</p>
    <p>The cine broke the connection, his seamed leathery face twisting into a grin. ‘I hope it works. We’ll see.’</p>
    <p>He snapped his fingers. ‘Almost forgot. President Crosby’s nephew - Kane? - he was with you when you cracked up, wasn’t he? I’ve been wondering whether I should have waived training for him. How did he show up in the jungle?’</p>
    <p>‘Quite well,’ Scott said. ‘I had my eye on him. He’ll make a good soldier.’</p>
    <p>Rhys looked keenly at the captain. ‘What about discipline? I felt that was his weak spot.’</p>
    <p>‘I’ve no complaint to make.’</p>
    <p>‘So. Well, maybe. Starling’s outfit is bad training for anyone-especially a raw kid. Speaking of Starling, did Cine Mendez know anything about his using atomic power?’</p>
    <p>‘No, sir. If Starling’s doing that, he’s keeping it plenty quiet.’</p>
    <p>‘We’ll investigate after the battle. Can’t afford that sort of thing-we don’t want another holocaust. It was bad enough to lose Earth. It decimated the race. If it happened again, it’d wipe the race out.’</p>
    <p>‘I don’t think there’s much danger of that. On Earth, it was the big atomic power-stations that got out of control. At worst, Starling can’t have more than hand weapons.’</p>
    <p>‘True. You can’t blow up a world with those. But you know the law - no atomic power on Venus.’</p>
    <p>Scott nodded.</p>
    <p>‘Well, that’s all.’ Rhys waved him away. ‘Clear weather.’</p>
    <p>Which, on this perpetually clouded world, had a tinge of irony.</p>
    <p>After mess Scott returned to his quarters, for a smoke and a brief rest. He waved away Briggs’ suggestion of a rubdown and sent the orderly to the commissary for fresh tobacco. ‘Be sure to get Twenty Star,’ he cautioned. ‘I don’t want that green hydroponic cabbage.’</p>
    <p>‘I know the brand, sir.’ Briggs looked hurt and departed. Scott settled back in his relaxer, sighing.</p>
    <p>Zero hour at twelve. The last zero hour he’d ever know. All through the day he had been conscious that he was fulfilling his duties for the last time.</p>
    <p>His mind went back to Montana Keep. He was living again those other-worldly moments in the cloud-wrapped Olympus with Ilene. Curiously, he found it difficult to visualize the girl’s features. Perhaps she was a symbol - her appearance did not matter. Yet she was very lovely.</p>
    <p>In a different way from Jeana. Scott glanced at Jeana’s picture on the desk, three-dimensional and tinted after life. By pressing a button on the frame, he could have given it sound and motion. He leaned forward and touched the tiny stud. In the depths of the picture the figure of Jeana stirred, smiling. The red lips parted.</p>
    <p>Her voice, though soft, was quite natural.</p>
    <p>‘Hello, Brian,’ the recording said. ‘Wish I were with you now. Here’s a present, darling.’ The image blew him a kiss, and then faded back to immobility.</p>
    <p>Scott sighed again. Jeana was a comfortable sort of person. But-Oh, hell! She wasn’t willing to change. Very likely she couldn’t. Ilene perhaps was equally dogmatic, but she represented the life of the Keeps - and that was what Scott wanted now.</p>
    <p>It was an artificial life Ilene lived, but she was honest about it. She knew its values were false. At least she didn’t pretend, like the Free Companions, that there were ideals worth dying for. Scott remembered Briggs. The fact that men had been killed during the building of Doone fort meant a lot to the old orderly. He never asked himself-why? Why had they died? Why was Doone fort built in the first place? For war. And war was doomed.</p>
    <p>One had to believe in an ideal before devoting one’s life to it. One had to feel he was helping the ideal to survive -watering the plant with his blood so eventually it would come to flower. The red flower of Mars had long since blown. How did that old poem go?</p>
    <p>One thing is certain, and the rest is lies; The flower that once has blown forever dies.</p>
    <p>It was true. But the Free Companions blindly pretended that the flower was still in blazing scarlet bloom, refusing to admit that even the roots were withered and useless, scarcely able now to suck up the blood sacrificed to its hopeless thirst.</p>
    <p>New flowers bloomed; new buds opened. But in the Keeps, not in the great doomed forts. It was the winter cycle, and, as the last season’s blossoms faded, the buds of the next stirred into life. Life questing and intolerant. Life that fed on the rotting petals of the rose of war.</p>
    <p>But the pretence went on, in the coastal forts that guarded the Keeps. Scott made a grimace of distaste. Blind, stupid folly! He was a man first, not a soldier. And man is essentially a hedonist, whether he identifies himself with the race or not.</p>
    <p>Scott could not. He was not part of the undersea culture, and he could never be. But he could lose himself in the hedonistic backwash of the Keeps, the froth that always overlies any social unit. With Ilene, he could, at least, seek happiness, without the bitter self-mockery he had known for so long. Mockery at his own emotional weaknesses in which he did not believe.</p>
    <p>Ilene was honest. She knew she was damned, because unluckily she had intelligence.</p>
    <p>So - Scott thought - they would make a good pair.</p>
    <p>Scott looked up as Commander Bienne came into the room. Bienne’s sour, mahogany face was flushed deep red under the bronze. His lids were heavy over angry eyes. He swung the door-curtain shut after him and stood rocking on his heels, glowering at Scott.</p>
    <p>He called Scott something unprintable.</p>
    <p>The captain rose, an icy knot of fury in his stomach. Very softly he said, ‘You’re drunk, Bienne. Get out. Get back to your quarters.’</p>
    <p>‘Sure-you little tinhorn soldier. You like to give orders, don’t you? You like to chisel, too. The way you chiselled me out of that left-wing command today. I’m pretty sick of it, Captain Brian Scott.’</p>
    <p>‘Don’t be a damned fool! I don’t like you personally any more than you like me, but that’s got nothing to do with the Company. I recommended you for that command.’</p>
    <p>‘You lie,’ Bienne said, swaying. ‘And I hate your guts.’</p>
    <p>Scott went pale, the scar on his cheek flaming red. Bienne came forward. He wasn’t too drunk to co-ordinate. His fist lashed out suddenly and connected agonizingly with Scott’s molar.</p>
    <p>The captain’s reach was less than Bienne’s. He ducked inside of the next swing and carefully smashed a blow home on the point of the other’s jaw. Bienne was driven back, crashing against the wall and sliding down in a limp heap, his head lolling forward.</p>
    <p>Scott, rubbing his knuckles, looked down, considering.</p>
    <p>Presently he knelt and made a quick examination. A knockout, that was all.</p>
    <p>Oh, well.</p>
    <p>Briggs appeared, showing no surprise at the sight of Bienne’s motionless body. The perfect orderly walked across to the table and began to refill the humidor with the tobacco he had brought.</p>
    <p>Scott almost chuckled.</p>
    <p>‘Briggs.’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, sir?’</p>
    <p>‘Commander Bienne’s had a slight accident. He-slipped. Hit his chin on something. He’s a bit tight, too. Fix him up, will you?’</p>
    <p>‘With pleasure, sir.’ Briggs hoisted Bienne’s body across his brawny shoulders.</p>
    <p>‘Zero hour’s at twelve. The commander must be aboard the Flintlock by then. And sober. Can do?’</p>
    <p>‘Certainly, sir,’ Briggs said, and went out.</p>
    <p>Scott returned to his chair, filling his pipe. He should have confined Bienne to his quarters, of course. But - well, this was a personal matter. One could afford to stretch a point, especially since Bienne was a valuable man to have aboard during action. Scott vaguely hoped the commander would get his thick head blown off.</p>
    <p>After a time he tapped the dottle from his pipe and went off for a final inspection.</p>
    <p>At midnight the fleet hoisted anchor.</p>
    <p>By dawn the Doones were nearing the Venus Deep.</p>
    <p>The ships of the Mob had already joined them, seven battleships, and assorted cruisers, destroyers, and one carrier. No monitor. The Mob didn’t own one - it had capsized two months before, and was still undergoing repairs.</p>
    <p>The combined fleets sailed in crescent formation, the left wing, commanded by Scott, composed of his own ship, the Flintlock, and the Arquebus, the Arrow, and the Misericordia, all Doone battlewagons. There were two Mob ships with him, the Navaho and the Zuni, the latter commanded by Cine Mendez. Scott had one carrier with him, the other being at right wing. Besides these, there were the lighter craft.</p>
    <p>In the centre were the battleships Arbalest, Lance, Catling, and Mace, as well as three of Mendez’s. Cine Rhys was aboard the Lance, controlling operations. The camouflaged monitor Armageddon was puffing away valiantly far behind, well out of sight in the mists.</p>
    <p>Scott was in his control room, surrounded by telaudio screens and switchboards. Six operators were perched on stools before the controls, ready to jump to action when orders came through their earphones. In the din of battle spoken commands often went unheard, which was why Scott wore a hush-mike strapped to his chest.</p>
    <p>His eyes roved over the semicircle of screens before him.</p>
    <p>‘Any report from the gliders yet?’</p>
    <p>‘No, sir.’</p>
    <p>‘Get me air-spotting command.’</p>
    <p>One of the screens flamed to life; a face snapped into view on it.</p>
    <p>‘Report.’</p>
    <p>‘Nothing yet, captain. Wait.’ There was a distant thunder. ‘Detectors clamped on a telaudio tight-beam directly overhead.’</p>
    <p>‘Enemy glider in the clouds?’</p>
    <p>‘Apparently. It’s out of the focus now.’</p>
    <p>‘Try to relocate it.’</p>
    <p>A lot of good that would do. Motored planes could easily be detected overhead, but a glider was another matter. The only way to spot one was by clamping a detector focus directly on the glider’s telaudio beam-worse than a needle in a haystack. Luckily the crates didn’t carry bombs.</p>
    <p>‘Report coming in, sir. One of our gliders.’</p>
    <p>Another screen showed a face. ‘Pilot reporting, sir. Located enemy.’</p>
    <p>‘Good. Switch in the telaudio, infra. What sector?’</p>
    <p>‘V.D. eight hundred seven north-west twenty-one.’</p>
    <p>Scott said into his hush-mike, ‘Get Cine Rhys and Commander Geer on tight-beam. And Cine Mendez.’</p>
    <p>Three more screens lit up, showing the faces of the three officers.</p>
    <p>‘Cut in the pilot.’</p>
    <p>Somewhere over Venus Deep the glider pilot was arcing his plane through the cloud-layer, the automatic telaudio-camera, lensed to infra-red, penetrating the murk and revealing the ocean below. On the screen ships’ showed driving forward in battle formation.</p>
    <p>Scott recognized and enumerated them mentally. The Orion, the Straw, the Vega, the Polaris - uh-huh. Lighter ships. Plenty of them. The scanner swept on.</p>
    <p>Cine Rhys said, ‘We’re outnumbered badly Cine Mendez, are your sub-detectors in operation?’</p>
    <p>‘They are. Nothing yet.’</p>
    <p>‘We’ll join battle in half an hour, I judge. We’ve located them, and they’ve no doubt located us.’</p>
    <p>‘Check.’</p>
    <p>The screens blanked out. Scott settled back, alertly at ease. Nothing to do now but wait, keeping ready for the unexpected. The Orion and the Vega were the Helldivers’ biggest battleships, larger than anything in the line of the Doones - or the Mob. Cine Flynn was no doubt aboard the Orion. The Helldivers owned a monitor, but it had not showed on the infra-red aerial scanner. Probably the behemoth wouldn’t even show up in time for the battle.</p>
    <p>But even without the monitor, the Helldivers had an overwhelming surface display. Moreover, their undersea fleet was an important factor. The sub-detectors of Cine Mendez might - probably would - cut down the odds. But possibly not enough.</p>
    <p>The Armageddon, Scott thought, might be the point of decision, the ultimate argument. And, as yet, the camouflaged monitor was lumbering through the waves far in the wake of the Doones.</p>
    <p>Commander Bienne appeared on a screen. He had frozen into a disciplined, trained robot, personal animosities forgotten for the time. Active duty did that to a man.</p>
    <p>Scott expected nothing different, however, and his voice was completely impersonal as he acknowledged Bienne’s call.</p>
    <p>‘The flitterboats are ready to go, captain.’</p>
    <p>‘Send them out in fifteen minutes. Relay to left wing, all ships carrying flitters.’</p>
    <p>‘Check.’</p>
    <p>For a while there was silence. A booming explosion brought Scott to instant alertness. He glanced up at the screens.</p>
    <p>A new face appeared. ‘Helldivers opening up. Testing for range. They must have gliders overhead. We can’t spot ‘em.’</p>
    <p>‘Get the men under cover. Send up a test barrage. Prepare to return fire. Contact our pilots over the Helldivers.’</p>
    <p>It was beginning now - the incessant, racking thunder that would continue till the last shot was fired. Scott cut in to Cine Rhys as the latter signalled.</p>
    <p>‘Reporting, sir.’</p>
    <p>Harry the enemy. We can’t do much yet. Change to R-8 formation.’</p>
    <p>Cine Mendez said, ‘We’ve got three enemy subs. Our detectors are tuned up to high pitch.</p>
    <p>‘Limit the range so our subs will be outside the sphere of influence.’</p>
    <p>‘Already did that. The enemy’s using magnetic depth charges, laying an undersea barrage as they advance.’</p>
    <p>‘I’ll talk to the sub command.’ Rhys cut off. Scott listened to the increasing fury of explosions. He could not yet hear the distinctive clap-clap of heat rays, but the quarters were not yet close enough for those undependable, though powerful, weapons. It took time for a heat ray to warm up, and during that period a well-aimed bullet could smash the projector lens.</p>
    <p>‘Casualty, sir. Direct hit aboard destroyer Bayonet.’</p>
    <p>‘Extent of damage?’</p>
    <p>‘Not disabled. Complete report later.’</p>
    <p>After a while a glider pilot came in on the beam.</p>
    <p>‘Shell landed on the Polaris, sir.’</p>
    <p>‘Use the scanner.’</p>
    <p>It showed the Helldivers’ battlewagon, part of the superstructure carried away, but obviously still in fighting trim. Scott nodded. Both sides were getting the range now. The hazy clouds still hid each fleet from the other, but they were nearing.</p>
    <p>The sound of artillery increased. Problems of trajectory were increased by the violent winds of Venus, but accurate aiming was possible. Scott nodded grimly as a crash shook the Flintlock.</p>
    <p>They were getting it now. Here, in the brain of the ship, he was as close to the battle as any member of a firing crew. The screens were his eyes.</p>
    <p>They had the advantage of being able to use infra-red, so that Scott, buried here, could see more than he could have on deck, with his naked eye. Something loomed out of the murk and Scott’s breath stopped before he recognized the lines of the Doone battlewagon Misericordia. She was off course. The captain used his hush-mike to snap a quick reprimand.</p>
    <p>Flitterboats were going out now, speedy hornets that would harry the enemy fleet. In one of them, Scott remembered, was Norman Kane. He thought of Ilene and thrust the thought back, out of his mind. No time for that now.</p>
    <p>Battle stations allowed no time for wool gathering.</p>
    <p>The distant vanguard of the Helldivers came into sight on the screens. Cine Mendez called.</p>
    <p>‘Eleven more subs. One got through. Seems to be near the Flintlock. Drop depth bombs.’</p>
    <p>Scott nodded and obeyed. Shuddering concussions shook the ship. Presently a report came in: fuel slick to starboard.</p>
    <p>Good. A few well-placed torpedoes could do a lot of damage.</p>
    <p>The Flintlock heeled incessantly under the action of the heavy guns. Heat rays were lancing out. The big ships could not easily avoid the searing blasts that could melt solid metal, but the flitterboats, dancing around like angry insects, sent a rain of bullets at the projectors. But even that took integration. The rays themselves were invisible, and could only be traced from their targets. The camera crews were working overtime, snapping shots of the enemy ships, tracing the rays’ points of origin, and telaudioing the information to the flitterboats.</p>
    <p>‘Helldivers’ Rigel out of action.’</p>
    <p>On the screen the big destroyer swung around, bow pointing forward. She was going to ram. Scott snapped orders. The Flintlock went hard over, guns pouring death into the doomed Rigel.</p>
    <p>The ships passed, so close that men on the Flintlock’s decks could see the destroyer lurching through the haze. Scott judged her course and tried desperately to get Mendez. There was a delay.</p>
    <p>‘QM-QM- emergency! Get the Zuni!’</p>
    <p>‘Here she answers, sir.’</p>
    <p>Scott snapped, ‘Change course. QM. Destroyer Rigel bearing down on you.’</p>
    <p>‘Check.’ The screen blanked. Scott used a scanner. He groaned at the sight. The Zuni was swinging fast, but the Rigel was too close - too damned close.</p>
    <p>She rammed.</p>
    <p>Scott said, ‘Hell.’ That put the Zuni out of action. He reported to Cine Rhys.</p>
    <p>‘All right, captain. Continue R-8 formation.’</p>
    <p>Mendez appeared on a screen. ‘Captain Scott. We’re disabled. I’m coming aboard. Have to direct substrafing operations. Can you give me a control board?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, sir. Land at Port Sector 7.’</p>
    <p>Hidden in the mist, the fleets swept on in parallel courses, the big battlewagons keeping steady formation, pouring heat rays and shells across the gap. The lighter ships strayed out of line at times, but the flitterboats swarmed like midges, dog-fighting when they were not harrying the larger craft. Gliders were useless now, at such close quarters.</p>
    <p>The thunder crashed and boomed. Shudders rocked the Flintlock.</p>
    <p>‘Hit on Helldivers’ Orion. Hit on Sinus.’</p>
    <p>‘Hit on Mob ship Apache.’</p>
    <p>‘Four more enemy subs destroyed.’</p>
    <p>‘Doone sub X-i6 fails to report.’</p>
    <p>‘Helldivers’ Polaris seems disabled.’</p>
    <p>‘Send out auxiliary flitterboats, units nine and twenty.’</p>
    <p>Cine Mendez came in, breathing hard. Scott waved him to an auxiliary control unit seat.</p>
    <p>‘Hit on Lance. Wait a minute. Cine Rhys a casualty, sir.’</p>
    <p>Scott froze. ‘Details.’</p>
    <p>‘One moment-Dead, sir.’</p>
    <p>‘Very well,’ Scott said after a moment. ‘I’m assuming command. Pass it along.’</p>
    <p>He caught a sidelong glance from Mendez. When a Company’s cine was killed, one of two things happened -promotion of a new cine, or a merger with another Company. In this case Scott was required, by his rank, to assume temporarily the fleet’s command. Later, at the Doone fort, there would be a meeting and a final decision.</p>
    <p>He scarcely thought of that now. Rhys dead! Tough, unemotional old Rhys, killed in action. Rhys had a free-wife in some Keep, Scott remembered. The Company would pension her. Scott had never seen the woman. Oddly, he wondered what she was like. The question had never occurred to him before.</p>
    <p>The screens were flashing. Double duty now - or triple. Scott forgot everything else in directing the battle.</p>
    <p>It was like first-stage anaesthesia - it was difficult to judge time. It might have been an hour or six since the battle had started. Or less than an hour for that matter.</p>
    <p>‘Destroyer disabled. Cruiser disabled. Three enemy subs L out of action -‘</p>
    <p>It went on, endlessly. At the auxiliaries Mendez was ‘ directing substrafing operations. Where in hell’s the Armageddon, Scott thought? The fight would be over before that overgrown tortoise arrived.</p>
    <p>Abruptly a screen flashed QM. The lean, beak-nosed face of Cine Flynn of the Helldivers showed.</p>
    <p>‘Calling Ddone command.’</p>
    <p>‘Acknowledging,’ Scott said. ‘Captain Scott, emergency command.’</p>
    <p>Why was Flynn calling? Enemy fleets in action never communicated, except to surrender.</p>
    <p>Flynn said curtly, ‘You’re using atomic power, captain. Explanation, please.’</p>
    <p>Mendez jerked around. Scott felt a tight band around his stomach.</p>
    <p>‘Done without my knowledge or approval, of course, Cine Flynn. My apologies. Details?’</p>
    <p>‘One of your flitterboats fired an atomic-powered pistol at the Orion. One seven-unit gun disabled.’</p>
    <p>‘One of ours, of the same calibre, will be taken out of action immediately. Further details, sir?’</p>
    <p>‘Use your scanner, captain, on Sector Mobile 18 south Orion. Your apology is accepted. The incident will be erased from our records.’</p>
    <p>Flynn clicked off. Scott used the scanner, catching a Doone fiitterboat in its focus. He used the enlarger.</p>
    <p>The little boat was fleeing from enemy fire, racing back toward the Doone fleet, heading directly toward the Flintlock, Scott saw. Through the transparent shell he saw the bombardier slumped motionless, his head blown half off. The pilot, still gripping an atomic-fire pistol in one hand, was Norman Kane. Blood streaked his boyish, strained face.</p>
    <p>So Starling’s outfit did have atomic power, then. Kane must have smuggled the weapon out with him when he left. And, in the excitement of battle, he had used it against the enemy.</p>
    <p>Scott said coldly, ‘Gun crews starboard. Fiitterboat Z-/O—4. Blast it.’</p>
    <p>Almost immediately a shell burst near the little craft. On the screen Kane looked up, startled by his own side firing upon him. Comprehension showed on his face. He swung the flitterboat off course, zigzagging, trying desperately to dodge the barrage.</p>
    <p>Scott watched, his lips grimly tight. The flitterboat exploded in a rain of spray and debris.</p>
    <p>Automatic court martial.</p>
    <p>After the battle, the Companies would band together and smash Starling’s outfit.</p>
    <p>Meantime this was action. Scott returned to his screens, erasing the incident from his mind.</p>
    <p>Very gradually the balance of power was increasing with the Helldivers. Both sides were losing ships, put out of action rather than sunk, and Scott thought more and more often of the monitor Armageddon. She could turn the battle now. But she was still far astern.</p>
    <p>Scott never felt the explosion that wrecked the control room. His senses blacked out without warning.</p>
    <p>He could not have been unconscious for long. When he opened his eyes, he stared up at a shambles. He seemed to be the only man left alive. But it could not have been a direct hit, or he would not have survived either.</p>
    <p>He was lying on his back, pinned down by a heavy crossbeam. But no bones were broken. Blind, incredible luck had helped him there. The brunt of the damage had been borne by the operators. They were dead, Scott saw at a glance.</p>
    <p>He tried to crawl out from under the beam, but that was impossible. In the thunder of battle his voice could not be heard.</p>
    <p>There was a movement across the room, halfway to the door. Cine Mendez stumbled up and stared around, blinking. Red smeared his plump cheeks.</p>
    <p>He saw Scott and stood, rocking back and forth, staring.</p>
    <p>Then he put his hand on the butt of his pistol.</p>
    <p>Scott could very easily read the other’s mind. If the Doone captain died now, the chances were that Mendez could merge with the Doones and assume control. The politico-military balance lay that way.</p>
    <p>If Scott lived, it was probable that he would be elected cine. It was, therefore, decidedly to Mendez’s advantage to kill the trapped man.</p>
    <p>A shadow crossed the doorway. Mendez, his back to the newcomer, did not see Commander Bienne halt on the threshold, scowling at the tableau. Scott knew that Bienne understood the situation as well as he himself did. The commander realized that in a very few moments Mendez would draw his gun and fire.</p>
    <p>Scott waited. The cinc’s fingers tightened on his gun butt.</p>
    <p>Bienne, grinning crookedly, said, ‘I thought that shell had finished you, sir. Guess it’s hard to kill a Dooneman.’</p>
    <p>Mendez took his hand off the gun, instantly regaining his poise. He turned to Bienne.</p>
    <p>‘I’m glad you’re here, commander. It’ll probably take both of us to move that beam.’</p>
    <p>‘Shall we try, sir?’</p>
    <p>Between the two of them, they managed to shift the weight off Scott’s torso. Briefly the latter’s eyes met Bienne’s. There was still no friendliness in them, but there was a look of wry self-mockery.</p>
    <p>Bienne hadn’t saved Scott’s life, exactly. It was, rather, a question of being a Dooneman. For Bienne was, first of all, a soldier, and a member of the Free Company.</p>
    <p>Scott tested his limbs; they worked.</p>
    <p>‘How long was I out, commander?’</p>
    <p>‘Ten minutes, sir. The Armageddon’s in sight.’</p>
    <p>‘Good. Are the Helldivers veering off?’</p>
    <p>Bienne shook his head. ‘So far they’re not suspicious.’</p>
    <p>Scott grunted and made his way to the door, the others at his heels. Mendez said, ‘We’ll need another control ship.’</p>
    <p>‘All right. The Arquebus. Commander, take over here. Cine Mendez -‘</p>
    <p>A flitterboat took them to the Arquebus, which was still in good fighting trim. The monitor Armageddon, Scott saw, was rolling helplessly in the trough of the waves. In accordance with the battle plan, the Doone ships were leading the Helldivers toward the apparently capsized giant. The technicians had done a good job; the false keel looked shockingly convincing.</p>
    <p>Aboard the Arquebus, Scott took over, giving Mendez the auxiliary control for his substrafers. The cine beamed at Scott over his shoulder.</p>
    <p>‘Wait till that monitor opens up, captain.’</p>
    <p>‘Yeah … we’re in bad shape, though.’</p>
    <p>Neither man mentioned the incident that was in both their minds. It was tacitly forgotten - the only thing to do now.</p>
    <p>Guns were still bellowing. The Helldivers were pouring their fire into the Doone formation, and they were winning. Scott scowled at the screens. If he waited too long, it would be just too bad.</p>
    <p>Presently he put a beam on the Armageddon. She was in a beautiful position now, midway between two of the Helldivers’ largest battleships.</p>
    <p>‘Unmask. Open fire.’</p>
    <p>Firing ports opened on the monitor. The sea titan’s huge guns snouted into view. Almost simultaneously they blasted, the thunder drowning out the noise of the lighter guns.</p>
    <p>‘All Doone ships attack,’ Scott said. ‘Plan R-j.’</p>
    <p>This was it. This was it!</p>
    <p>The Doones raced into the kill. Blasting, bellowing, shouting, the guns tried to make themselves heard above the roaring of the monitor. They could not succeed, but that savage, invincible onslaught won the battle.</p>
    <p>It was nearly impossible to manoeuvre a monitor into battle formation, but, once that was accomplished, the only thing that could stop the monster was atomic power.</p>
    <p>But the Helldivers fought on, trying strategic formation. They could not succeed. The big battlewagons could not get out of range of the Armageddon’s guns. And that meant—</p>
    <p>Cine Flynn’s face showed on the screen.</p>
    <p>‘Capitulation, sir. Cease firing.’</p>
    <p>Scott gave orders. The roar of the guns died into humming, incredible silence.</p>
    <p>‘You gave us a great battle, cine.’</p>
    <p>‘Thanks. So did you. Your strategy with the monitor was excellent.’</p>
    <p>So - that was that. Scott felt something go limp inside of him. Flynn’s routine words were meaningless; Scott was drained of the vital excitement that had kept him going till now.</p>
    <p>The rest was pure formula.</p>
    <p>Token depth charges would be dropped over Virginia Keep. They would not harm the Dome, but they were the rule. There would be the ransom, paid always by the Keep which backed the losing side. A supply of korium, or its negotiable equivalent. The Doone treasury would be swelled. Part of the money would go into replacements and new keels. The life of the forts would go on.</p>
    <p>Alone at the rail of the Arquebus, heading for Virginia Keep, Scott watched slow darkness change the clouds from pearl to grey, and then to invisibility. He was alone in the night. The wash of waves came up to him softly as the Arquebus rushed to her destination, three hundred miles away.</p>
    <p>Warm yellow lights gleamed from ports behind him, but he did not turn. This, he thought, was like the cloud-wrapped Olympus in Montana Keep, where he had promised Ilene - many things.</p>
    <p>Yet there was a difference. On an Olympus a man was really a god, shut away completely from the living world. Here, in the unbroken dark, there was no sense of alienage. Nothing. He was gazing up into the nothingness overhead - Venus had no moon, and the clouds hid the stars. And the seas are not phosphorescent.</p>
    <p>Beneath these waters stand the Keeps, Scott thought. They hold the future. Such battles as were fought today are fought so that the Keeps may not be destroyed.</p>
    <p>And men will sacrifice. Men have always sacrificed, for a social organization or a military unit. Man must create his own ideal. ‘If there had been no God, man would have created Him.’</p>
    <p>Bienne had sacrificed today, in a queer, twisted way of loyalty to his fetish. Yet Bienne still hated him, Scott knew.</p>
    <p>The Doones meant nothing. Their idea was a false one. Yet, because men were faithful to that ideal, civilization would rise again from the guarded Keeps. A civilization that would forget its doomed guardians, the waters of the seas of Venus, the Free Companions yelling their mad, futile battle cry as they drove on-as this ship was driving-into a night that would have no dawn.</p>
    <p>Ilene.</p>
    <p>Jeana.</p>
    <p>It was no such simple choice. It was, in fact, no real choice at all. For Scott knew, very definitely, that he could never, as long as he lived, believe wholeheartedly in the Free Companions. Always a sardonic devil deep within him would be laughing in bitter self-mockery.</p>
    <p>The whisper of the waves drifted up.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t sensible. It was sentimental, crazy, stupid, sloppy thinking.</p>
    <p>But Scott knew, now, that he wasn’t going back to Ilene.</p>
    <p>He was a fool.</p>
    <p>But he was a soldier.</p>

    <p>WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>THEY WERE SURPRISED at getting the apartment, what with high rents and written-in clauses in the lease, and Joe Calderon felt himself lucky to be only ten minutes subway ride from the University. His wife, Myra, fluffed up her red hair in a distracted fashion and said that landlords presumably expected parthenogenesis in their tenants, if that was what she meant. Anyhow, it was where an organism split in two and the result was two mature specimens. Calderon grinned, said, “Binary fission, chump,” and watched young Alexander, aged eighteen months, backing up on all fours across the carpet, preparatory to assuming a standing position on his fat bowlegs.</p>
   <p>It was a pleasant apartment, at that. The sun came into it at times, and there were more rooms than they had any right to expect, for the price. The next-door neighbor, a billowy blonde who talked of little except her migraine, said that it was hard to keep tenants in 4-D. It wasn’t exactly haunted, but it had the queerest visitors. The last lessee, an insurance man who drank heavily, moved out one day talking about little men who came ringing the bell at all hours asking for a Mr. Pott, or somebody like that. Not until some time later did Joe identify Pott with Cauldron-or Calderon.</p>
   <p>They were sitting on the couch in a pleased manner, looking at Alexander. He was quite a baby. Like all infants, he had a collar of fat at the back of his neck, and his legs, Calderon said, were like two vast and trunkless limbs of stone-at least they gave that effect. The eyes stopped at their incredible bulging pinkness, fascinated. Alexander laughed like a fool, rose to his feet, and staggered drunkenly toward his parents, muttering unintelligible gibberish. “Madman,” Myra said fondly, and tossed the child a floppy velvet pig of whom he was enamored.</p>
   <p>“So we’re all set for the winter,” Calderon said. He was a tall, thin, harassed-looking man, a fine research physicist, and very much interested in his work at the University. Myra was a rather fragile redhead, with a tilted nose and sardonic red-brown eyes. She made deprecatory noises.</p>
   <p>“If we can get a maid. Otherwise I’ll char.”</p>
   <p>“You sound like a lost soul,” Calderon said. “What do you mean, you’ll char?”</p>
   <p>“Like a charwoman. Sweep, cook, clean. Babies are a great trial. Still, they’re worth it.”</p>
   <p>“Not in front of Alexander. He’ll get above himself.”</p>
   <p>The doorbell rang. Calderon uncoiled himself, wandered vaguely across the room, and opened the door. He blinked at nothing. Then he lowered his gaze somewhat, and what he saw was sufficient to make him stare a little.</p>
   <p>Four tiny men were standing in the hall. That is, they were tiny below the brows. Their craniums were immense, watermelon large and watermelon shaped, or else they were wearing abnormally huge helmets of glistening metal. Their faces were wizened, peaked tiny masks that were nests of lines and wrinkles. Their clothes were garish, unpleasantly colored, and seemed to be made of paper.</p>
   <p>“Oh?” Calderon said blankly.</p>
   <p>Swift looks were exchanged among the four. One of them said, “Are you Joseph Calderon?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah.”</p>
   <p>“We,” said the most wrinkled of the quartet, “are your son’s descendents. He’s a super child. We’re here to educate him.”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Calderon said. “Yes, of course. I… listen!”</p>
   <p>“To what?”</p>
   <p>“Super -”</p>
   <p>“There he is,” another dwarf cried. “It’s Alexander! We’ve hit the right time at last!” He scuttled past Calderon’s legs and into the room. Calderon made a few futile snatches, but the small men easily evaded him. When he turned, they were gathered around Alexander. Myra had drawn up her legs under her and was watching with an amazed expression.</p>
   <p>“Look at that,” a dwarf said. “See his potential tefeetzie?” It sounded like tefeetzie.</p>
   <p>“But his skull, Bordent,” another put in. “That’s the important part. The vyrings are almost perfectly coblast-ably.”</p>
   <p>“Beautiful,” Bordent acknowledged. He leaned forward. Alexander reached forward into the nest of wrinkles, seized Bordent’s nose, and twisted painfully. Bordent bore it stoically until the grip relaxed.</p>
   <p>“Undeveloped,” he said tolerantly. “We’ll develop him.”</p>
   <p>Myra sprang from the couch, picked up her child, and stood at bay, facing the little men. “Joe,” she said, “are you going to stand for this? Who are these bad-mannered goblins?”</p>
   <p>“Lord knows,” Calderon said. He moistened his lips. “What kind of a gag is that? Who sent you?”</p>
   <p>“Alexander,” Bordent said. “From the year… ah… about 2450, reckoning roughly. He’s practically immortal. Only violence can kill one of the Supers, and there’s none of that in 2450.”</p>
   <p>Calderon sighed. “No, I mean it. A gag’s a gag. But-”</p>
   <p>“Time and again we’ve tried. In 1940, 1944, 1947-all around this era. We were either too early or too late. But now we’ve hit on the right time-sector. It’s our job to educate Alexander. You should feel proud of being his parents. We worship you, you know. Father and mother of the new race.”</p>
   <p>“Tuh!” Calderon said. “Come off it!”</p>
   <p>“They need proof, Dobish,” someone said. “Remember, this is their first inkling that Alexander is homo superior.”</p>
   <p>“Homo nuts,” Myra said. “Alexander’s a perfectly normal baby.”</p>
   <p>“He’s perfectly supernormal,” Dobish said. “We’re his descendents.”</p>
   <p>“That makes you a superman,” Calderon said skeptically, eyeing the small man.</p>
   <p>“Not in toto. There aren’t many of the X Free type. The biological norm is specialization. Only a few are straight-line super. Some specialize in logic, others in vervainity, others-like us-are guides. If we were X Free supers, you couldn’t stand there and talk to us. Or look at us. We’re only parts. Those like Alexander are the glorious whole.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, send them away,” Myra said, getting tired of it. “I feel like a Thurber woman.”</p>
   <p>Calderon nodded. “O.K. Blow, gentlemen. Take a powder. I mean it.”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Dobish said, “they need proof. What’ll we do? Skyskinate?”</p>
   <p>“Too twisty,” Bordent objected. “Object lesson, eh? The stiller.”</p>
   <p>“Stiller?” Myra asked.</p>
   <p>Bordent took an object from his paper clothes and spun it in his hands. His fingers were all double-jointed. Calderon felt a tiny electric shock go through him.</p>
   <p>“Joe,” Myra said, white-faced. “I can’t move.”</p>
   <p>“Neither can I. Take it easy. This is… it’s-” He slowed and stopped.</p>
   <p>“Sit down,” Bordent said, still twirling the object. Calderon and Myra backed up to the couch and sat down. Their tongues froze with the rest of them.</p>
   <p>Dobish came over, clambered up, and pried Alexander out of his mother’s grip. Horror moved in her eyes.</p>
   <p>“We won’t hurt him,” Dobish said. “We just want to give him his first lesson. Have you got the basics, Finn?”</p>
   <p>“In the bag.” Finn extracted a foot-long bag from his garments. Things came out of that bag. They came out incredibly. Soon the carpet was littered with stuff-problematical in design, nature, and use. Calderon recognized a tesseract.</p>
   <p>The fourth dwarf, whose name, it turned out, was Quat, smiled consolingly at the distressed parents. “You watch. You can’t learn; you’ve not got the potential. You’re homo saps. But Alexander, now-”</p>
   <p>Alexander was in one of his moods. He was diabolically gay. With the devil-possession of all babies, he refused to collaborate. He crept rapidly backwards. He burst into loud, squalling sobs. He regarded his feet with amazed joy.</p>
   <p>He stuffed his fist into his mouth and cried bitterly at the result. He talked about invisible things in a soft, cryptic monotone. He punched Dobish in the eye.</p>
   <p>The little men had inexhaustible patience. Two hours later they were through. Calderon couldn’t see that Alexander had learned much.</p>
   <p>Bordent twirled the object again. He nodded affably, and led the retreat. The four little men went out of the apartment, and a moment later Calderon and Myra could move.</p>
   <p>She jumped up, staggering on numbed legs, seized Alexander, and collapsed on the couch. Calderon rushed to the door and flung it open. The hall was empty.</p>
   <p>“Joe -” Myra said, her voice small and afraid. Calderon came back and smoothed her hair. He looked down at the bright fuzzy head of Alexander.</p>
   <p>“Joe. We’ve got to do - do something.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know,” he said. “If it happened -”</p>
   <p>“It happened. They took those things with them. Alexander. Oh!”</p>
   <p>“They didn’t try to hurt him,” Calderon said hesitatingly.</p>
   <p>“Our baby! He’s no superchild.”</p>
   <p>“Well,” Calderon said, “I’ll get out my revolver. What else can I do?”</p>
   <p>“I’ll do something,” Myra promised. “Nasty little goblins! I’ll do something, just wait.”</p>
   <p>And yet there wasn’t a great deal they could do.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Tacitly they ignored the subject the next day. But at 4 P.M., the same time as the original visitation, they were with Alexander in a theater, watching the latest Technicolor film. The four little men could scarcely find them here—</p>
   <p>Calderon felt Myra stiffen, and even as he turned, he suspected the worst. Myra sprang up, her breath catching. Her fingers tightened on his arm.</p>
   <p>“He’s gone!”</p>
   <p>“G-gone?”</p>
   <p>“He just vanished. I was holding him… let’s get out of here.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe you dropped him,” Calderon said inanely, and lit a match. There were cries from behind. Myra was already pushing her way toward the aisle. There were no babies under the seat, and Calderon caught up with his wife in the lobby.</p>
   <p>“He disappeared,” Myra was babbling. “Like that. Maybe he’s in the future. Joe, what’ll we do?”</p>
   <p>Calderon, through some miracle, got a taxi. “We’ll go home. That’s the most likely place. I hope.”</p>
   <p>“Yes. Of course it is. Give me a cigarette.”</p>
   <p>“He’ll be in the apartment -”</p>
   <p>He was, squatting on his haunches, taking a decided interest in the gadget Quat was demonstrating. The gadget was a gayly-colored egg beater with four-dimensional attachments, and it talked in a thin, high voice. Not in English.</p>
   <p>Bordent flipped out the stiller and began to twirl it as the couple came in. Calderon got hold of Myra’s arms and held her back, “Hold on,” he said urgently. “That isn’t necessary. We won’t try anything.”</p>
   <p>“Joe!” Myra tried to wriggle free. “Are you going to let them-”</p>
   <p>“Quiet!” he said. “Bordent, put that thing down. We want to talk to you.”</p>
   <p>“Well-if you promise not to interrupt-”</p>
   <p>“We promise.” Calderon forcibly led Myra to the couch and held her there. “Look, darling. Alexander’s all right. They’re not hurting him.”</p>
   <p>“Hurt him, indeed!” Finn said. “He’d skin us alive in the future if we hurt him in the past.”</p>
   <p>“Be quiet,” Bordent commanded. He seemed to be the leader of the four. “I’m glad you’re cooperating, Joseph Calderon. It goes against my grain to use force on a demigod. After all, you’re Alexander’s father.”</p>
   <p>Alexander put out a fat paw and tried to touch the whirling rainbow egg beater. He seemed to be fascinated. Quat said, “The kivelish is sparking. Shall I vastinate?”</p>
   <p>“Not too fast,” Bordent said. “He’ll be rational in a week, and then we can speed up the process. Now, Calderon, please relax. Anything you want?”</p>
   <p>“A drink.”</p>
   <p>“They mean alcohol,” Finn said. “The Rubaiyat mentions it, remember?”</p>
   <p>“Rubaiyat?”</p>
   <p>“The singing red gem in Twelve Library.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, yes,” Bordent said. “That one. I was thinking of the Yahveh slab, the one with the thunder effects. Do you want to make some alcohol, Finn?”</p>
   <p>Calderon swallowed. “Don’t bother. I have some in that sideboard. May I -”</p>
   <p>“You’re not prisoners.” Bordent’s voice was shocked. “It’s just that we’ve got to make you listen to a few explanations, and after that-well, it’ll be different.”</p>
   <p>Myra shook her head when Calderon handed her a drink, but he scowled at her meaningly. “You won’t feel it. Go ahead.”</p>
   <p>She hadn’t once taken her gaze from Alexander. The baby was imitating the thin noise of the egg beater now. It was subtly unpleasant.</p>
   <p>“The ray is working,” Quat said. “The viewer shows some slight cortical resistance, though.”</p>
   <p>“Angle the power,” Bordent told him.</p>
   <p>Alexander said, “Modjewabba?”</p>
   <p>“What’s that?” Myra asked in a strained voice. “Super language?”</p>
   <p>Bordent smiled at her. “No, just baby talk.”</p>
   <p>Alexander burst into sobs. Myra said, “Super baby or not, when he cries like that, there’s a good reason. Does your tutoring extend to that point?”</p>
   <p>“Certainly,” Quat said calmly. He and Finn carried Alexander out. Bordent smiled again.</p>
   <p>“You’re beginning to believe,” he said. “That helps.” Calderon drank, feeling the hot fumes of whiskey along the backs of his cheeks. His stomach was crawling with cold uneasiness.</p>
   <p>“If you were human-” he said doubtfully.</p>
   <p>“If we were, we wouldn’t be here. The old order changeth. It had to start sometime. Alexander is the first homo superior.”</p>
   <p>“But why us?” Myra asked.</p>
   <p>“Genetics. You’ve both worked with radioactivity and certain short-wave radiations that effected the germ plasm. The mutation just happened. It’ll happen again from now on. But you happen to be the first. You’ll die, but Alexander will live on. Perhaps a thousand years.”</p>
   <p>Calderon said, “This business of coming from the future… you say Alexander sent you?”</p>
   <p>“The adult Alexander. The mature superman. It’s a different culture, of course-beyond your comprehension. Alexander is one of the X Frees. He said to me, through the interpreting-machine, of course, ‘Bordent, I wasn’t recognized as a super till I was thirty years old. I had only ordinary homo sap development till then. I didn’t know my potential myself. And that’s bad.’ It is bad, you know,” Bordent digressed. “The full capabilities of an organism can’t emerge unless it’s given the fullest chance of expansion from birth on. Or at least from infancy. Alexander said to me, ‘It’s about five hundred years ago that I was born. Take a few guides and go into the past. Locate me as an infant. Give me specialized training, from the beginning. I think it’ll expand me.’ “</p>
   <p>“The past,” Calderon said. “You mean it’s plastic?”</p>
   <p>“Well, it affects the future. You can’t alter the past without altering the future, too. But things tend to drift back. There’s a temporal norm, a general level. In the original time sector, Alexander wasn’t visited by us. Now that’s changed. So the future will be changed. But not tremendously. No crucial temporal apexes are involved, no keystones. The only result will be that the mature Alexander will have his potential more fully realized.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Alexander was carried back into the room, beaming. Quat resumed his lesson with the egg beater.</p>
   <p>“There isn’t a great deal you can do about it,” Bordent said. “I think you realize that now.”</p>
   <p>Myra said, “Is Alexander going to look like you?” Her face was strained.</p>
   <p>“Oh, no. He’s a perfect physical specimen. I’ve never seen him, of course, but-”</p>
   <p>Calderon said, “Heir to all the ages. Myra, are you beginning to get the idea?”</p>
   <p>“Yes. A superman. But he’s our baby.”</p>
   <p>“He’ll remain so,” Bordent put in anxiously. “We don’t want to remove him from the beneficial home and parental influence. An infant needs that. In fact, tolerance for the young is an evolutionary trait aimed at providing for the superman’s appearance, just as the vanishing appendix is such a preparation. At certain eras of history mankind is receptive to the preparation of the new race. It’s never been quite successful before-there were anthropological miscarriages, so to speak. My squeevers, it’s important! Infants are awfully irritating. They’re helpless for a very long time, a great trial to the patience of the parents-the lower the order of the animal, the faster the infant develops. With mankind, it takes years for the young to reach an independent state. So the parental tolerance increases in proportion. The superchild won’t mature, actually, till he’s about twenty.”</p>
   <p>Myra said, “Alexander will still be a baby then?”</p>
   <p>“He’ll have the physical standards of an eight-year-old specimen of homo sap. Mentally… well, call it irrationality. He won’t be leveled out to an intellectual or emotional norm. He won’t be sane, any more than any baby is. Selectivity takes quite a while to develop. But his peaks will be far, far above the peaks of, say, you as a child.”</p>
   <p>“Thanks,” Calderon said.</p>
   <p>“His horizons will be broader. His mind is capable of grasping and assimilating far more than yours. The world is really his oyster. He won’t be limited. But it’ll take a while for his mind, his personality, to shake down.”</p>
   <p>“I want another drink,” Myra said.</p>
   <p>Calderon got it. Alexander inserted his thumb in Quat’s eye and tried to gouge it out. Quat submitted passively.</p>
   <p>“Alexander!” Myra said.</p>
   <p>“Sit still,” Bordent said. “Quat’s tolerance in this regard is naturally higher developed than yours.”</p>
   <p>“If he puts Quat’s eye out,” Calderon said, “it’ll be just too bad.”</p>
   <p>“Quat isn’t important, compared to Alexander. He knows it, too.”</p>
   <p>Luckily for Quat’s binocular vision, Alexander suddenly tired of his new toy and fell to staring at the egg beater again. Dobish and Finn leaned over the baby and looked at him. But there was more to it than that, Calderon felt.</p>
   <p>Induced telepathy,” Bordent said. “It takes a long time to develop, but we’re starting now. I tell you, it was a relief to hit the right time at last. I’ve rung this doorbell at least a hundred times. But never till now-”</p>
   <p>“Move,” Alexander said clearly. “Real. Move.”</p>
   <p>Bordent nodded. “Enough for today. We’ll be here again tomorrow. You’ll be ready?”</p>
   <p>“As ready,” Myra said, “as we’ll ever be, I suppose.” She finished her drink.</p>
   <p>They got fairly high that night and talked it over. Their arguments were biased by their realization of the four little men’s obvious resources. Neither doubted any more. They knew that Bordent and his companions had come from five hundred years in the future, at the command of a future Alexander who had matured into a fine specimen of superman.</p>
   <p>“Amazing, isn’t it?” Myra said. “That fat little blob in the bedroom turning into a twelfth-power Quiz Kid.”</p>
   <p>“Well, it’s got to start somewhere. As Bordent pointed out.”</p>
   <p>“And as long as he isn’t going to look like those goblins-ugh!”</p>
   <p>“He’ll be super. Deucalion and what’s-her-name-that’s us. Parents of a new race.”</p>
   <p>“I feel funny,” Myra said. “As though I’d given birth to a moose.”</p>
   <p>“That could never happen,” Calderon said consolingly. “Have another slug.”</p>
   <p>“It might as well have happened. Alexander is a swoose.”</p>
   <p>“Swoose?”</p>
   <p>“I can use that goblin’s doubletalk, too. Vopishly wog-gle in the grand foyer. So there.”</p>
   <p>“It’s a language to them,” Calderon said.</p>
   <p>“Alexander’s going to talk English. I’ve got my rights.” “Well, Bordent doesn’t seem anxious to infringe on them. He said Alexander needed a home environment.”</p>
   <p>“That’s the only reason I haven’t gone crazy,” Myra said. “As long as he… they… don’t take our baby away from us -”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>A week later it was thoroughly clear that Bordent had no intention of encroaching on parental rights-at least, any more than was necessary, for two hours a day. During that period the four little men fulfilled their orders by cramming Alexander with all the knowledge his infantile but super brain could hold. They did not depend on blocks or nursery rhymes or the abacus. Their weapons in the battle were cryptic, futuristic, but effective. And they taught Alexander, there was no doubt of that. As B-1 poured on a plant’s roots forces growth, so the vitamin teaching of the dwarfs soaked into Alexander, and his potentially superhuman brain responded, expanding with brilliant, erratic speed.</p>
   <p>He had talked intelligibly on the fourth day. On the seventh day he was easily able to hold conversations, though his baby muscles, lingually undeveloped, tired easily. His cheeks were still sucking-disks; he was not yet fully human, except in sporadic flashes. Yet those flashes came oftener now, and closer together.</p>
   <p>The carpet was a mess. The little men no longer took their equipment back with them; they left it for Alexander to use. The infant crept-he no longer bothered to walk much, for he could crawl with more efficiency-among the Objects, selected some of them, and put them together. Myra had gone out to shop. The little men wouldn’t show up for half an hour. Calderon, tired from his day’s work at the University, fingered a highball and looked at his offspring.</p>
   <p>“Alexander,” he said.</p>
   <p>Alexander didn’t answer. He fitted a gadget to a Thing, inserted it peculiarly in a Something Else, and sat back with an air of satisfaction. Then-“Yes?” he said. It wasn’t perfect pronunciation, but it was unmistakable. Alexander talked somewhat like a toothless old man.</p>
   <p>“What are you doing?” Calderon said.</p>
   <p>“No.”</p>
   <p>“What’s that?”</p>
   <p>“No.”</p>
   <p>“No?”</p>
   <p>“I understand it,” Alexander said. “That’s enough.”</p>
   <p>“I see.” Calderon regarded the prodigy with faint apprehension. “You don’t want to tell me.”</p>
   <p>“No.”</p>
   <p>“Well, all right.”</p>
   <p>“Get me a drink,” Alexander said. For a moment Calderon had a mad idea that the infant was demanding a highball. Then he sighed, rose, and returned with a bottle.</p>
   <p>“Milk,” Alexander said, refusing the potation.</p>
   <p>“You said a drink. Water’s a drink, isn’t it?” My God, Calderon thought, I’m arguing with the kid. I’m treating him like … like an adult. But he isn’t. He’s a fat little baby squatting on his behind on the carpet, playing with a tinkertoy.</p>
   <p>The tinkertoy said something in a thin voice. Alexander murmured, “Repeat.” The tinkertoy did.</p>
   <p>Calderon said, “What was that?”</p>
   <p>“No.”</p>
   <p>“Nuts.” Calderon went out to the kitchen and got milk. He poured himself another shot. This was like having relatives drop in suddenly-relatives you hadn’t seen for ten years. How the devil did you act with a superchild?</p>
   <p>He stayed in the kitchen, after supplying Alexander with his milk. Presently Myra’s key turned in the outer door. Her cry brought Calderon hurrying.</p>
   <p>Alexander was vomiting, with the air of a research man absorbed in a fascinating phenomenon.</p>
   <p>“Alexander!” Myra cried. “Darling, are you sick?”</p>
   <p>“No,” Alexander said. “I’m testing my regurgitative processes. I must learn to control my digestive organs.”</p>
   <p>Calderon leaned against the door, grinning crookedly. “Yeah. You’d better start now, too.”</p>
   <p>“I’m finished,” Alexander said. “Clean it up.”</p>
   <p>Three days later the infant decided that his lungs needed developing. He cried. He cried at all hours, with interesting variations-whoops, squalls, wails, and high-pitched bellows. Nor would he stop till he was satisfied. The neighbors complained. Myra said, “Darling, is there a pin sticking you? Let me look-”</p>
   <p>“Go away,” Alexander said. “You’re too warm. Open the window. I want fresh air.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, d-darling. Of course.” She came back to bed and Calderon put his arm around her. He knew there would be shadows under her eyes in the morning. In his crib Alexander cried on.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>So it went. The four little men came daily and gave Alexander his lessons. They were pleased with the infant’s progress. They did not complain when Alexander indulged in his idiosyncrasies, such as batting them heavily on the nose or ripping their paper garments to shreds. Bordent tapped his metal helmet and smiled triumphantly at Calderon.</p>
   <p>“He’s coming along. He’s developing.”</p>
   <p>“I’m wondering. What about discipline?”</p>
   <p>Alexander looked up from his rapport with Quat. “Homo sap discipline doesn’t apply to me, Joseph Calderon.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t call me Joseph Calderon. I’m your father, after all.”</p>
   <p>“A primitive biological necessity. You are sufficiently well developed to provide the discipline I require. Your purpose is to give me parental care.”</p>
   <p>“Which makes me an incubator,” Calderon said.</p>
   <p>“But a deified one,” Bordent soothed him. “Practically a logos. The father of the new race.”</p>
   <p>“I feel more like Prometheus,” the father of the new race said dourly. “He was helpful, too. And he ended up with a vulture eating his liver.”</p>
   <p>“You will learn a great deal from Alexander.”</p>
   <p>“He says I’m incapable of understanding it.”</p>
   <p>“Well, aren’t you?”</p>
   <p>“Sure. I’m just the papa bird,” Calderon said, and subsided into a sad silence, watching Alexander, under Quat’s tutelary eye, put together a gadget of shimmering glass and twisted metal. Bordent said suddenly. “Quat! Be careful of the egg!” And Finn seized a bluish ovoid just before Alexander’s chubby hand could grasp it.</p>
   <p>“It isn’t dangerous,” Quat said. “It isn’t connected.”</p>
   <p>“He might have connected it.”</p>
   <p>“I want that,” Alexander said. “Give it to me.”</p>
   <p>“Not yet, Alexander,” Bordent refused. “You must learn the correct way of connecting it first. Otherwise it might harm you.”</p>
   <p>“I could do it.”</p>
   <p>“You are not logical enough to balance your capabilities and lacks as yet. Later it will be safe. I think now, perhaps, a little philosophy, Dobish-eh?”</p>
   <p>Dobish squatted and went en rapport with Alexander. Myra came out of the kitchen, took a quick look at the tableau, and retreated. Calderon followed her out.</p>
   <p>“I will never get used to it if I live a thousand years,” she said with slow emphasis, hacking at the doughy rim of a pie. “He’s my baby only when he’s asleep.”</p>
   <p>“We won’t live a thousand years,” Calderon told her. “Alexander will, though. I wish we could get a maid.”</p>
   <p>“I tried again today,” Myra said wearily. “No use. They’re, all in war plants. I mention a baby-”</p>
   <p>“You can’t do all this alone.”</p>
   <p>“You help,” she said, “when you can. But you’re working hard too, fella. It won’t be forever.”</p>
   <p>“I wonder if we had another baby… if-”</p>
   <p>Her sober gaze met his. “I’ve wondered that, too. But I should think mutations aren’t as cheap as that. Once in a lifetime. Still, we don’t know.”</p>
   <p>“Well, it doesn’t matter now, anyway. One infant’s enough for the moment.”</p>
   <p>Myra glanced toward the door. “Everything all right in there? Take a look. I worry.”</p>
   <p>“It’s all right.”</p>
   <p>“I know, but that blue egg-Bordent said it was dangerous, you know. I heard him.”</p>
   <p>Calderon peeped through the door-crack. The four dwarfs were sitting facing Alexander, whose eyes were closed. Now they opened. The infant scowled at Calderon.</p>
   <p>“Stay out,” he requested. “You’re breaking the rapport.”</p>
   <p>“I’m so sorry,” Calderon said, retreating. “He’s O.K., Myra. His own dictatorial little self.”</p>
   <p>“Well, he is a superman,” she said doubtfully.</p>
   <p>“No. He’s a superbaby. There’s all the difference.”</p>
   <p>“His latest trick,” Myra said, busy with the oven, “is riddles. Or something like riddles. I feel so small when he catches me up. But he says it’s good for his ego. It compensates for his physical frailness.”</p>
   <p>“Riddles, eh? I know a few too.”</p>
   <p>“They won’t work on Alexander,” Myra said, with grim assurance.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Nor did they. “What goes up a chimney up?” was treated with the contempt it deserved; Alexander examined his father’s riddles, turned them over in his logical mind, analyzed them for flaws in semantics and logic, and rejected them. Or else he answered them, with such fine accuracy that Calderon was too embarrassed to give the correct answers. He was reduced to asking why a raven was like a writing desk, and since not even the Mad Hatter had been able to answer his own riddle, was slightly terrified to find himself listening to a dissertation on comparative ornithology. After that, he let Alexander needle him with infantile gags about the relations of gamma rays to photons, and tried to be philosophical. There are few things as irritating as a child’s riddles. His mocking triumph pulverizes itself into the dust in which you grovel.</p>
   <p>“Oh, leave your father alone,” Myra said, coming in with her hair disarranged. “He’s trying to read the paper.”</p>
   <p>“That news is unimportant.”</p>
   <p>“I’m reading the comics,” Calderon said. “I want to see if the Katzenjammers get even with the Captain for hanging them under a waterfall.”</p>
   <p>“The formula for the humor of an incongruity predicament,” Alexander began learnedly, but Calderon disgustedly went into the bedroom, where Myra joined him.</p>
   <p>“He’s asking me riddles again,” she said. “Let’s see what the Katzenjammers did.”</p>
   <p>“You look rather miserable. Got a cold?”</p>
   <p>“I’m not wearing make-up. Alexander says the smell makes him ill.”</p>
   <p>“So what? He’s no petunia.”</p>
   <p>“Well,” Myra said, “he does get ill. But of course he does it on purpose.”</p>
   <p>“Listen. There he goes again. What now?”</p>
   <p>But Alexander merely wanted an audience. He had found a new way of making imbecilic noises with his fingers and lips. At times the child’s normal phases were more trying than his super periods. After a month had passed, however, Calderon felt that the worst was yet to come. Alexander had progressed into fields of knowledge hitherto untouched by homo sap, and he had developed a leechlike habit of sucking his father’s brains dry of every scrap of knowledge the wretched man possessed.</p>
   <p>It was the same with Myra. The world was indeed Alexander’s oyster. He had an insatiable curiosity about everything, and there was no longer any privacy in the apartment. Calderon took to locking the bedroom door against his son at night-Alexander’s crib was now in another room-but furious squalls might waken him at any hour.</p>
   <p>In the midst of preparing dinner, Myra would be forced to stop and explain the caloric mysteries of the oven to Alexander. He learned all she knew, took a jump into more abstruse aspects of the matter, and sneered at her ignorance. He found out Calderon was a physicist, a fact which the man had hitherto kept carefully concealed, and thereafter pumped his father dry. He asked questions about geodetics and geopolitics. He inquired about monotremes and monorails. He was curious about biremes and biology. And he was skeptical, doubting the depth of his father’s knowledge. “But,” he said, “you and Myra Calderon are my closest contacts with homo sap as yet, and it’s a beginning. Put out that cigarette. It isn’t good for my lungs.”</p>
   <p>“All right,” Calderon said. He rose wearily, with his usual feeling these days of being driven from room to room of the apartment, and went in search of Myra. “Bordent’s about due. We can go out somewhere. O. K.?”</p>
   <p>“Swell.” She was at the mirror, fixing her hair, in a trice. “I need a permanent. If I only had the time-!”</p>
   <p>“I’ll take off tomorrow and stay here. You need a rest.”</p>
   <p>“Darling, no. The exams are coming up. You simply can’t do it.”</p>
   <p>Alexander yelled. It developed that he wanted his mother to sing for him. He was curious about the tonal range of homo sap and the probable emotional and soporific effect of lullabies. Calderon mixed himself a drink, sat in the kitchen and smoked, and thought about the glorious destiny of his son. When Myra stopped singing, he listened for Alexander’s wails, but there was no sound till a slightly hysterical Myra burst in on him, dithering and wide-eyed.</p>
   <p>“Joe!” She fell into Calderon’s arms. “Quick, give me a drink or… or hold me tight or something.”</p>
   <p>“What is it?” He thrust the bottle into her hands, went to the door, and looked out. “Alexander? He’s quiet. Eating candy.”</p>
   <p>Myra didn’t bother with a glass. The bottle’s neck clicked against her teeth. “Look at me. Just look at me. I’m a mess.”</p>
   <p>“What happened?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. Alexander’s turned into a black magician, that’s all.” She dropped into a chair and passed a palm across her forehead. “Do you know what that genius son of ours just did?”</p>
   <p>“Bit you,” Calderon hazarded, not doubting it for a minute.</p>
   <p>“Worse, far worse. He started asking me for candy. I said there wasn’t any in the house. He told me to go down to the grocery for some. I said I’d have to get dressed first, and I was too tired.”</p>
   <p>“Why didn’t you ask me to go?”</p>
   <p>“I didn’t have the chance. Before I could say boo that infantile Merlin waved a magic wand or something. I… I was down at the grocery. Behind the candy counter.”</p>
   <p>Calderon blinked. “Induced amnesia?”</p>
   <p>“There wasn’t any time-lapse. It was just phweet - and there I was. In this rag of a dress, without a speck of makeup on, and my hair coming down in tassels. Mrs. Busherman was there, too, buying a chicken-that cat across the hall. She was kind enough to tell me I ought to take more care of myself. Meow,” Myra ended furiously.</p>
   <p>“Good Lord.”</p>
   <p>“Teleportation. That’s what Alexander says it is. Something new he’s picked up. I’m not going to stand for it, Joe. I’m not a rag doll, after all.” She was half hysterical.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Calderon went into the next room and stood regarding his child. There was chocolate smeared around Alexander’s mouth.</p>
   <p>“Listen, wise guy,” he said. “You leave your mother alone, hear me?”</p>
   <p>“I didn’t hurt her,” the prodigy pointed out, in a blobby voice. “I was simply being efficient.”</p>
   <p>“Well, don’t be so efficient. Where did you learn that trick, anyhow?”</p>
   <p>“Teleportation? Quat showed me last night. He can’t do it himself, but I’m X Free super, so I can. The power isn’t disciplined yet. If I’d tried to teleport Myra Calderon over to Jersey, say, I might have dropped her in the Hudson by mistake.”</p>
   <p>Calderon muttered something uncomplimentary. Alexander said, “Is that an Anglo-Saxon derivative?”</p>
   <p>“Never mind about that. You shouldn’t have all that chocolate, anyway. You’ll make yourself sick. You’ve already made your mother sick. And you nauseate me.”</p>
   <p>“Go away,” Alexander said. “I want to concentrate on the taste.”</p>
   <p>“No. I said you’d make yourself sick. Chocolate’s too rich for you. Give it here. You’ve had enough.” Calderon reached for the paper sack. Alexander disappeared. In the kitchen Myra shrieked.</p>
   <p>Calderon moaned despondently, and turned. As he had expected, Alexander was in the kitchen, on top of the stove, hoggishly stuffing candy into his mouth. Myra was concentrating on the bottle.</p>
   <p>“What a household,” Calderon said. “The baby teleporting himself all over the apartment, you getting stewed in the kitchen, and me heading for a nervous breakdown.” He started to laugh. “O.K., Alexander. You can keep the candy. I know when to shorten my defensive lines strategically.”</p>
   <p>“Myra Calderon,” Alexander said. “I want to go back into the other room.”</p>
   <p>“Fly in,” Calderon suggested. “Here, I’ll carry you.”</p>
   <p>“Not you. Her. She has a better rhythm when she walks.”</p>
   <p>“Staggers, you mean,” Myra said, but she obediently put aside the bottle, got up, and laid hold of Alexander. She went out. Calderon was not much surprised to hear her scream a moment later. When he joined the happy family, Myra was sitting on the floor, rubbing her arms and biting her lips. Alexander was laughing.</p>
   <p>“What now?”</p>
   <p>“H-he sh-shocked me,” Myra said in a child’s voice. “He’s like an electric eel. He d-did it on purpose, too. Oh, Alexander, will you stop laughing!”</p>
   <p>“You fell down,” the infant crowed in triumph. “You yelled and fell down.”</p>
   <p>Calderon looked at Myra, and his mouth tightened. “Did you do that on purpose?” he asked.</p>
   <p>“Yes. She fell down. She looked funny.”</p>
   <p>“You’re going to look a lot funnier in a minute. X Free super or not, what you need is a good paddling.”</p>
   <p>“Joe -” Myra said.</p>
   <p>“Never mind. He’s got to learn to be considerate of the rights of others.”</p>
   <p>“I’m homo superior,” Alexander said, with the air of one clinching an argument.</p>
   <p>“It’s homo posterior I’m going to deal with,” Calderon announced, and attempted to capture his son. There was a stinging blaze of jolting nervous energy that blasted up through his synapses; he went backwards ignominously, and slammed into the wall, cracking his head hard against it. Alexander laughed like an idiot.</p>
   <p>“You fell down, too,” he crowed. “You look funny.”</p>
   <p>“Joe,” Myra said. “Joe. Are you hurt?”</p>
   <p>Calderon said sourly that he supposed he’d survive. Though, he added, it would probably be wise to lay in a few splints and a supply of blood plasma. “In case he gets interested in vivisection.”</p>
   <p>Myra regarded Alexander with troubled speculation. “You’re kidding, I hope.”</p>
   <p>“I hope so, too.”</p>
   <p>“Well - here’s Bordent. Let’s talk to him.”</p>
   <p>Calderon answered the door. The four little men came in solemnly. They wasted no time. They gathered about Alexander, unfolded fresh apparatus from the recesses of their paper clothes, and set to work. The infant said, “I teleported her about eight thousand feet.”</p>
   <p>“That far, eh?” Quat said. “Were you fatigued at all?”</p>
   <p>“Not a bit.”</p>
   <p>Calderon dragged Bordent aside. “I want to talk to you. I think Alexander needs a spanking.”</p>
   <p>“By voraster!” the dwarf said, shocked. “But he’s Alexander! He’s X Free type super!”</p>
   <p>“Not yet. He’s still a baby.”</p>
   <p>“But a superbaby. No, no, Joseph Calderon. I must tell you again that disciplinary measures can be applied only by sufficiently intelligent authorities.”</p>
   <p>“You?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, not yet,” Bordent said. “We don’t want to overwork him. There’s a limit even to super brain power, especially in the very formative period. He’s got enough to do, and his attitudes for social contacts won’t need forming for a while yet.”</p>
   <p>Myra joined them. “I don’t agree with you there. Like all babies, he’s antisocial. He may have superhuman powers but he’s subhuman as far as mental and emotional balance go.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah,” Calderon agreed. “This business of giving us electric shocks-”</p>
   <p>“He’s only playing,” Bordent said.</p>
   <p>“And teleportation. Suppose he teleports me to Times Square when I’m taking a shower?”</p>
   <p>“It’s only his play. He’s a baby still.”</p>
   <p>“But what about us?”</p>
   <p>“You have the hereditary characteristic of parental tolerance,” Bordent explained. “As I told you before, Alexander and his race are the reason why tolerance was created in the first place. There’s no great need for it with homo sap. I mean there’s a wide space between normal tolerance and normal provocation. An ordinary baby may try his parents severely for a few moments at a time, but that’s about all. The provocation is far too small to require the tremendous store of tolerance the parents have. But with the X Free type, it’s a different matter.”</p>
   <p>“There’s a limit even to tolerance,” Calderon said. “I’m wondering about a creche.”</p>
   <p>Bordent shook his shiny metallic-sheathed head. “He needs you.”</p>
   <p>“But,” Myra said, “but! Can’t you give him just a little discipline?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, it isn’t necessary. His mind’s still immature, and he must concentrate on more important things. You’ll tolerate him.”</p>
   <p>“It’s not as though he’s our baby any more,” she murmured. “He’s not Alexander.”</p>
   <p>“But he is. That’s just it. He’s Alexander!”</p>
   <p>“Look, it’s normal for a mother to want to hug her baby. But how can she do that if she expects him to throw her halfway across the room?”</p>
   <p>Calderone was brooding. “Will he pick up more… more super powers as he goes along?”</p>
   <p>“Why, yes. Naturally.”</p>
   <p>“He’s a menace to life and limb. I still say he needs discipline. Next time I’ll wear rubber gloves.”</p>
   <p>“That won’t help,” Bordent said, frowning. “Besides, I must insist… no, Joseph Calderon, it won’t do. You mustn’t interfere. You’re not capable of giving him the right sort of discipline-which he doesn’t need yet anyway.”</p>
   <p>“Just one spanking,” Calderon said wistfully. “Not for revenge. Only to show him he’s got to consider the rights of others.”</p>
   <p>“He’ll learn to consider the rights of other X Free supers. You must not attempt anything of the sort. A spanking-even if you succeeded, which is far from probable-might warp him psychologically. We are his tutors, his mentors. We must protect him. You understand?”</p>
   <p>“I think so,” Calderon said slowly. “That’s a threat.”</p>
   <p>“You are Alexander’s parents, but it’s Alexander who is important. If I must apply disciplinary measures to you, I must.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, forget it,” Myra sighed. “Joe, let’s go out and walk in the park while Bordent’s here.”</p>
   <p>“Be back in two hours,” the little man said. “Good-by.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>As time went past, Calderon could not decide whether Alexander’s moronic phases or his periods of keen intelligence were more irritating. The prodigy had learned new powers; the worst of that was that Calderon never knew what to expect, or when some astounding gag would be sprung on him. Such as the time when a mess of sticky taffy had materialized in his bed, filched from the grocery by deft teleportation. Alexander thought it was very funny. He laughed.</p>
   <p>And, when Calderon refused to go to the store to buy candy because he said he had no money-“Now don’t try to teleport me. I’m broke.”-Alexander had utilized mental energy, warping gravity lines shockingly. Calderon found himself hanging upside-down in midair, being shaken, while loose coins cascaded out of his pocket. He went after the candy.</p>
   <p>Humor is a developed sense, stemming basically from cruelty. The more primitive a mind, the less selectivity exists. A cannibal would probably be profoundly amused by the squirmings of his victim in the seething kettle. A man slips on a banana peel and breaks his back. The adult stops laughing at that point, the child does not. And a civilized ego finds embarrassment as acutely distressing as physical pain. A baby, a child, a moron, is incapable of practicing empathy. He cannot identify himself with another individual. He is regrettably autistic; his own rules are arbitrary, and garbage strewn around the bedroom was funny to neither Myra nor Calderon.</p>
   <p>There was a little stranger in the house. Nobody rejoiced. Except Alexander. He had a lot of fun.</p>
   <p>“No privacy,” Calderon said. “He materializes everywhere, at all hours. Darling, I wish you’d see a doctor.”</p>
   <p>“What would he advise?” Myra asked. “Rest, that’s all. Do you realize it’s been two months since Bordent took over?”</p>
   <p>“And we’ve made marvelous progress,” Bordent said, coming over to them. Quat was en rapport with Alexander on the carpet, while the other two dwarfs prepared the makings of a new gadget. “Or, rather, Alexander has made remarkable progress.”</p>
   <p>“We need a rest,” Calderon growled. “If I lose my job, who’ll support that genius of yours?” Myra looked at her husband quickly, noting the possessive pronoun he had used.</p>
   <p>Bordent was concerned. “You are in difficulty?”</p>
   <p>“The Dean’s spoken to me once or twice. I can’t control my classes any more. I’m too irritable.”</p>
   <p>“You don’t need to expend tolerance on your students. As for money, we can keep you supplied. I’ll arrange to get some negotiable currency for you.”</p>
   <p>“But I want to work. I like my job.”</p>
   <p>“Alexander is your job.”</p>
   <p>“I need a maid,” Myra said, looking hopeless. “Can’t you make me a robot or something? Alexander scares every maid I’ve ever managed to hire. They won’t stay a day in this madhouse.”</p>
   <p>“A mechanical intelligence would have a bad effect on Alexander,” Bordent said. “No.”</p>
   <p>“I wish we could have guests in once in a while. Or go out visiting. Or just be alone,” Myra sighed.</p>
   <p>“Some day Alexander will be mature, and you’ll reap your reward. The parents of Alexander. Did I ever tell you that we have images of you two in the Great Fogy Hall?”</p>
   <p>“They must look terrible,” Calderon said. “I know we do now.”</p>
   <p>“Be patient. Consider the destiny of your son.”</p>
   <p>“I do. Often. But he gets a little wearing sometimes. That’s quite an understatement.”</p>
   <p>“Which is where tolerance comes in,” Bordent said. “Nature planned well for the new race.”</p>
   <p>“Mm-m-m.”</p>
   <p>“He is working on sixth-dimensional abstractions now. Everything is progressing beautifully.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah,” Calderon said. And he went away, muttering, to join Myra in the kitchen.</p>
   <p>Alexander worked with facility at his gadgets, his pudgy fingers already stronger and surer. He still had an illicit passion for the blue ovoid, but under Bordent’s watchful eye he could use it only along the restricted lines laid out by his mentors. When the lesson was finished, Quat selected a few of the objects and locked them in a cupboard, as was his custom. The rest he left on the carpet to provide exercise for Alexander’s ingenuity.</p>
   <p>“He develops,” Bordent said. “Today we’ve made a great step.”</p>
   <p>Myra and Calderon came in in time to hear this. “What goes?” he asked.</p>
   <p>“A psychic bloc-removal. Alexander will no longer need to sleep.”</p>
   <p>“What?” Myra said.</p>
   <p>“He won’t require sleep. It’s an artificial habit anyway. The super race has no need of it.”</p>
   <p>“He won’t sleep any more, eh?” Calderon said. He had grown a little pale.</p>
   <p>“Correct. He’ll develop faster now, twice as fast.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>At 3:30 a. m. Calderon and Myra lay in bed, wide awake, looking through the open door in to the full blaze of light where Alexander played. Seen there clearly, as if upon a lighted stage, he did not look quite like himself any more. The difference was subtle, but it was there. Under the golden down his head had changed shape slightly, and there was a look of intelligence and purpose upon the blobby features. It was not an attractive look. It didn’t belong there. It made Alexander look less like a superbaby than a debased oldster. All a child’s normal cruelty and selfishness-perfectly healthy, natural traits in the developing infant-flickered across Alexander’s face as he played absorbedly with solid crystal blocks which he was fitting into one another like a Chinese puzzle. It was quite a shocking face to watch.</p>
   <p>Calderon heard Myra sigh beside him.</p>
   <p>“He isn’t our Alexander any more,” she said. “Not a bit.”</p>
   <p>Alexander glanced up and his face suddenly suffused. The look of paradoxical age and degeneracy upon it vanished as he opened his mouth and bawled with rage, tossing the blocks in all directions. Calderon watched one roll through the bedroom door and come to rest upon the carpet, spilling out of its solidity a cascade of smaller and smaller solid blocks that tumbled winking toward him. Alexander’s cries filled the apartment. After a moment windows began to slam across the court, and presently the phone rang. Calderon reached for it, sighing.</p>
   <p>When he hung up he looked across at Myra and grimaced. Above the steady roars he said, “Well, we have notice to move.”</p>
   <p>Myra said, “Oh. Oh, well.”</p>
   <p>“That about covers it.”</p>
   <p>They were silent for a moment. Then Calderon said, “Nineteen years more of it. I think we can expect about that. They did say he’d mature at twenty, didn’t they?”</p>
   <p>“He’ll be an orphan long before then,” Myra groaned. “Oh, my head! I think I caught cold when he teleported us up to the roof just before dinner. Joe, do you suppose we’re the first parents who ever got… got caught like this?”</p>
   <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
   <p>“I mean, was there ever another superbaby before Alexander? It does seem like a waste of a lot of tolerance if we’re the first to need it.”</p>
   <p>“We could use a lot more. We’ll need a lot.” He said nothing more for awhile, but he lay there thinking and trying not to hear his superchild’s rhythmic howling. Tolerance. Every parent needed a great deal of it. Every child was intolerable from time to time. The race had certainly needed parental love in vast quantities to permit its infants to survive. But no parents before had ever been tried consistently up to the very last degree of tolerance. No parents before had ever had to face twenty years of it, day and night, strained to the final notch. Parental love is a great and all-encompassing emotion, but-</p>
   <p>“I wonder,” he said thoughtfully. “I wonder if we are the first.”</p>
   <p>Myra’s speculations had been veering. “I suppose it’s like tonsils and appendix,” she murmured. “They’ve outlived their use, but they still hang on. This tolerance is vestigial in reverse. It’s been hanging on all these millenniums, waiting for Alexander.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe. I wonder-Still, if there ever had been an Alexander before now, we’d have heard of him. So-”</p>
   <p>Myra rose on one elbow and looked at her husband. “You think so?” she said softly. “I’m not so sure. I think it might have happened before.”</p>
   <p>Alexander suddenly quieted. The apartment rang with silence for a moment. Then a familiar voice, without words, spoke in both their brains simultaneously.</p>
   <p>“Get me some more milk. And I want it just warm, not hot.”</p>
   <p>Joe and Myra looked at one another again, speechless. Myra sighed and pushed the covers back. “I’ll go this time,” she said. “Something new, eh? I-”</p>
   <p>“Don’t dawdle,” said the wordless voice, and Myra jumped and gave a little shriek. Electricity crackled audibly through the room, and Alexander’s bawling laughter was heard through the doorway.</p>
   <p>“He’s about as civilized now as a well-trained monkey, I suppose,” Joe remarked, getting out of bed. “I’ll go. You crawl back in. And in another year he may reach the elevation of a bushman. After that, if we’re still alive, we’ll have the pleasure of living with a super-powered cannibal. Eventually he may work up to the level of practical joker. That ought to be interesting.” He went out, muttering to himself.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Ten minutes later, returning to bed, Joe found Myra clasping her knees and looking into space.</p>
   <p>“We aren’t the first, Joe,” she said, not glancing at him. “I’ve been thinking. I’m pretty sure we aren’t.”</p>
   <p>“But we’ve never heard of any supermen developing-”</p>
   <p>She turned her head and gave him a long, thoughtful look. “No,” she said.</p>
   <p>They were silent. Then, “Yes, I see what you mean,” he nodded.</p>
   <p>Something crashed in the living room. Alexander chuckled and the sound of splintering wood was loud in the silence of the night. Another window banged somewhere outside.</p>
   <p>“There’s a breaking point,” Myra said quietly. “There’s got to be.”</p>
   <p>“Saturation,” Joe murmured. “Tolerance saturation-or something. It could have happened.”</p>
   <p>Alexander trundled into sight, clutching something blue. He sat down and began to fiddle with bright wires. Myra rose suddenly.</p>
   <p>“Joe, he’s got that blue egg! He must have broken into the cupboard.”</p>
   <p>Calderon said, “But Quat told him-”</p>
   <p>“It’s dangerous!”</p>
   <p>Alexander looked at them, grinned, and bent the wires into a cradle-shape the size of the egg.</p>
   <p>Calderon found himself out of bed and halfway to the door. He stopped before he reached it. “You know,” he said slowly, “he might hurt himself with that thing.”</p>
   <p>“We’ll have to get it away from him,” Myra agreed, heaving herself up with tired reluctance.</p>
   <p>“Look at him,” Calderon urged. “Just look.”</p>
   <p>Alexander was dealing competently with the wires, his hands flickering into sight and out again as he balanced a tesseract beneath the cradle. That curious veil of knowledge gave his chubby face the debased look of senility which they had come to know so well.</p>
   <p>“This will go on and on, you know,” Calderon murmured. “Tomorrow he’ll look a little less like himself than today. Next week-next month-what will he be like in a year?”</p>
   <p>“I know.” Myra’s voice was an echo. “Still, I suppose we’ll have to-” Her voice trailed to a halt. She stood barefoot beside her husband, watching.</p>
   <p>“I suppose the gadget will be finished,” she said, “once he connects up that last wire. We ought to take it away from him.”</p>
   <p>“Think we could?”</p>
   <p>“We ought to try.”</p>
   <p>They looked at each other. Calderon said, “It looks like an Easter egg. I never heard of an Easter egg hurting anybody.”</p>
   <p>“I suppose we’re doing him a favor, really,” Myra said in a low voice. “A burnt child dreads the fire. Once a kid burns himself on a match, he stays away from matches.”</p>
   <p>They stood in silence, watching.</p>
   <p>It took Alexander about three more minutes to succeed in his design, whatever it was. The results were phenomenally effective. There was a flash of white light, a crackle of split air, and Alexander vanished in the dazzle, leaving only a faint burnt smell behind him.</p>
   <p>When the two could see again, they blinked distrustfully at the empty place. “Teleportation?” Myra whispered dazedly.</p>
   <p>“I’ll make sure.” Calderon crossed the floor and stood looking down at a damp spot on the carpet, with Alexander’s shoes in it. He said, “No. Not teleportation.” Then he took a long breath. “He’s gone, all right. So he never grew up and sent Bordent back in time to move in on us. It never happened.”</p>
   <p>“We weren’t the first,” Myra said in an unsteady, bemused voice. “There’s a breaking point, that’s all. How sorry I feel for the first parents who don’t reach it!”</p>
   <p>She turned away suddenly, but not so suddenly that he could not see she was crying. He hesitated, watching the door. He thought he had better not follow her just yet.</p>

    <p>JUKE BOX</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>JERRY FOSTER told the bartender that nobody loved him. The bartender, with the experience of his trade, said that Jerry was mistaken, and how about another drink. “Why not?” said the unhappy Mr. Foster, examining the scanty contents of his wallet. ” ‘I’ll take the daughter of the vine to spouse. Nor heed the music of a distant drum.’ That’s Omar.”</p>
   <p>“Sure,” the bartender said surprisingly. “But you want to look out you don’t go out by the same door that in you went. No brawls allowed here. This isn’t East Fifth, chum.”</p>
   <p>“You may call me chum,” Foster said, reverting to the main topic, “but you don’t mean it. I’m nobody’s pal. Nobody loves me.”</p>
   <p>“What about that babe you brought in last night?”</p>
   <p>Foster tested his drink. He was a good-looking, youngish man with slick blond hair and a rather hazy expression in his blue eyes.</p>
   <p>“Betty?” he murmured. “Well, the fact is, a while ago I was down at the Tom-Tom with Betty and this redhead came along. So I ditched Betty. Then the redhead iced me. Now I’m lonely, and everyone hates me.”</p>
   <p>“You shouldn’t of ditched Betty, maybe,” the bartender suggested.</p>
   <p>“I’m fickle,” Foster said, tears springing to his eyes. “I can’t help it. Women are my downfall. Gimme another drink and tell me your name.”</p>
   <p>“Austin.”</p>
   <p>“Austin. Well, Austin, I’m nearly in trouble. Did you notice who won the fifth at Santa Anita yesterday?”</p>
   <p>“Pig’s Trotters, wasn’t it?”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Foster said, “but I laid my dough right on the nose of White Flash. That’s why I’m here. Sammy comes around to this joint now, doesn’t he?”</p>
   <p>“That’s right.”</p>
   <p>“I’m lucky,” Foster said. “I got the money to pay him. Sammy is a hard man when you don’t pay off.”</p>
   <p>“I wouldn’t know,” the bartender said. “Excuse me.”</p>
   <p>He moved off to take care of a couple of vodka collinses.</p>
   <p>“So you hate me too,” Foster said, and, picking up his drink, wandered away from the bar.</p>
   <p>He was surprised to see Betty sitting alone in a booth, watching him. But he was not at all surprised to see that her blond hair, her limpid eyes, her pink-and-white skin had lost all attraction for him. She bored him. Also, she was going to make a nuisance of herself.</p>
   <p>Foster ignored the girl and went further back, to where a bulky oblong object was glowing in polychromatic colors against the far wall. It was what the manufacturers insist on terming an automatic phonograph, in spite of the more aptly descriptive word jukebox.</p>
   <p>This was a lovely jukebox. It had lots of lights and colors. Moreover, it wasn’t watching Foster, and it kept its mouth shut.</p>
   <p>Foster draped himself over the jukebox and patted its sleek sides.</p>
   <p>“You’re my girl,” he announced. “You’re beautiful. I love you madly, do you hear? Madly.”</p>
   <p>He could feel Betty’s gaze on his back. He swigged his drink and smoothed the jukebox’s flanks, glibly protesting his sudden affection for the object. Once he glanced around. Betty was starting to get up.</p>
   <p>Foster hastily found a nickel in his pocket and slipped it into the coin-lever, but before he could push it in, a stocky, dark man wearing horn-rimmed glasses entered the bar, nodded at Foster, and moved quickly to a booth where a fat person in tweeds was sitting. There was a short consultation, during which money changed hands, and the stocky man made a note in a small book he brought from his pocket.</p>
   <p>Foster took out his wallet. He had had trouble with Sammy before, and wanted no more. The bookie was insistent on his pound of flesh. Foster counted his money, blinked, and counted it again, while his stomach fell several feet. Either he had been short-changed, or he had lost some dough. He was short.</p>
   <p>Sammy wouldn’t like that.</p>
   <p>Forcing his fogged brain to think, Foster wondered how he could gain time. Sammy had already seen him. If he could duck out the back.</p>
   <p>It had become altogether too silent in the bar. He needed noise to cover his movements. He saw the nickel in the jukebox’s coin-lever and hastily pushed it in.</p>
   <p>Money began to spew out of the coin return slot.</p>
   <p>Foster got his hat under the slot almost instantly. Quarters, dimes, and nickels popped out in a never-ending stream. The jukebox broke into song. A needle scratched over the black disc. The torchy mourning of “My Man” came out sadly. It covered the tinkling of the coins as they filled Foster’s hat.</p>
   <p>After a while the money stopped coming out of the jukebox. Foster stood there, thanking his personal gods, as he saw Sammy moving toward him. The bookie glanced at Foster’s hat and blinked.</p>
   <p>“Hi, Jerry. What gives?”</p>
   <p>“I hit a jackpot,” Foster said.’</p>
   <p>“Not on the jukebox!”</p>
   <p>“No, down at the Onyx,” Foster said, naming a private club several blocks away. “Haven’t had a chance to get these changed into bills yet. Want to help me out?”</p>
   <p>“I’m no cash register,” Sammy said. “I’ll take mine in green.”</p>
   <p>The jukebox stopped playing “My Man” and broke into “Always.” Foster put his jingling hat on top of the phonograph and counted out bills. He didn’t have enough, but he made the balance up out of quarters he fished from the hat.</p>
   <p>“Thanks,” Sammy said. “Too bad your nag didn’t make it.”</p>
   <p>” ‘With a love that’s true, always-’” the jukebox sang fervently.</p>
   <p>“Can’t be helped,” Foster said. “Maybe next time I’ll hit ‘em.”</p>
   <p>“Want anything on Oaklawn?”</p>
   <p>” ‘When the things you’ve planned, need a helping hand-’”</p>
   <p>Foster had been leaning on the jukebox. On the last two words, a tingling little shock raced through him. Those particular two words jumped out of nothing, impinged on the surface of his brain, and sank hi indelibly, like the stamp of a die. He couldn’t hear anything else. They echoed and re-echoed.</p>
   <p>“Uh-helping hand,” he said hazily. “Helping-”</p>
   <p>“A sleeper?” Sammy said. “Okay, Helping Hand in the third, at Oaklawn. The usual?”</p>
   <p>The room started to turn around. Foster managed to nod. After a time he discovered that Sammy was gone. He saw his drink on the jukebox, next to his hat, and swallowed the cool liquid in three quick gulps. Then he bent and stared into the cryptic innards of the automatic phonograph.</p>
   <p>“It can’t be,” he whispered. “I’m drunk. But not drunk enough. I need another shot.”</p>
   <p>A quarter rolled out of the coin-return slot, and Foster automatically caught it.</p>
   <p>“No!” he gulped. “Oh-h-h!” He stuffed his pockets with the booty from the hat, held on to his glass with the grip of a drowning man, and went toward the bar. On the way he felt someone touch his sleeve.</p>
   <p>“Jerry,” Betty said. “Please.”</p>
   <p>He ignored her. He went on to the bar and ordered another drink.</p>
   <p>“Look, Austin,” he said. “That jukebox you got back there. Is it working all right?”</p>
   <p>Austin squeezed a lime. He didn’t look up.</p>
   <p>“I don’t hear any complaints.”</p>
   <p>“But-”</p>
   <p>Austin slid a replenished glass toward Foster.</p>
   <p>“Excuse me,” he said, and went to the other end of the bar.</p>
   <p>Foster stole a look at the jukebox. It sat against the wall glowing enigmatically.</p>
   <p>“I don’t exactly know what to think,” he said to no one in particular.</p>
   <p>A record started playing. The jukebox sang throatily:</p>
   <p>” ‘Leave us face it, we’re in love… .’”</p>
   <p>The truth was, Jerry Foster was feeling pretty low in those days. He was essentially a reactionary, so it was a mistake for him to have been born in an era of great change. He needed the feel of solid ground under his feet. And the ground wasn’t so solid any more, what with the newspaper headlines and new patterns for living emerging out of the vast technological and sociological changes the mid-Twentieth Century offered.</p>
   <p>You’ve got to be elastic to survive in a changing culture. Back in the stable Twenties, Foster would have got along beautifully, but now, in a word, he just wasn’t on the ball. A man like that seeks stable security as his ultimo, and security seemed to have vanished.</p>
   <p>The result was that Jerry Foster found himself out of a job, badly in debt, and drinking far more than he should have done. The only real advantage to that set-up was that alcohol buffered Foster’s incredulity when he encountered the affectionate jukebox.</p>
   <p>Not that he remembered it the next morning. He didn’t recall what had happened for a couple of days, till Sammy looked him up and gave him nine hundred dollars, the result of Helping Hand coming in under the wire at Oaklawn. The long shot had paid off surprisingly.</p>
   <p>Foster instantly went on a binge, finding himself eventually at a downtown bar he recognized. Austin was off duty, however, and Betty wasn’t present tonight. So Foster, tanked to the gills, leaned his elbow on polished mahogany and stared around. Toward the back was the jukebox. He blinked at it, trying to remember.</p>
   <p>The jukebox began to play “I’ll Remember April.” The whirling confusion of insobriety focused down to a small, clear, cold spot in Foster’s brain. He started to tingle. His mouth formed words:</p>
   <p>“Remember April-Remember April?”</p>
   <p>“All right!” said a fat, unshaven, untidy man standing next to him. “I heard you! I’ll-What did you say?”</p>
   <p>“Remember April,” Foster muttered, quite automatically. The fat man spilled his drink.</p>
   <p>“It isn’t! It’s March!”</p>
   <p>Foster peered around dimly in search of a calendar.</p>
   <p>“It’s April third,” he affirmed presently. “Why?”</p>
   <p>“I’ve got to get back, then,” said the fat man in desperation. He scrubbed at his sagging cheeks. “April already! How long have I been tight? You don’t know? It’s your business to know. April! One more drink, then.” He summoned the bartender.</p>
   <p>He was interrupted by the sudden appearance of a man with a hatchet. Foster, blearily eying the apparition, almost decided to get out in search of a quieter gin-mill. This new figure, bursting in from the street, was a skinny blond man with wild eyes and the shakes. Before anyone could stop him, he had rushed the length of the room and lifted his hatchet threateningly above the jukebox.</p>
   <p>“I can’t stand it!” he cried hysterically. “You spiteful little - I’ll fix you before you fix me!”</p>
   <p>So saying, and ignoring the purposeful approach of the bartender, the blond man brought down his hatchet heavily on the jukebox. There was a blue crackle of flame, a tearing noise, and the blond man collapsed without a sound.</p>
   <p>Foster stayed where he was. There was a bottle on the bar near him, and he captured it. Rather dimly, he realized what was happening. An ambulance was summoned. A doctor said the blond man had been painfully shocked, but was still alive. The jukebox had a smashed panel, but appeared uninjured otherwise. Austin came from somewhere and poured himself a shot from under the bar.</p>
   <p>“Each man kills the thing he loves,” Austin said to Foster. “You’re the guy who was quoting Omar at me the other night, aren’t you?”</p>
   <p>“What?” Foster said.</p>
   <p>Austin nodded at the motionless figure being loaded on a stretcher.</p>
   <p>“Funny business. That fella used to come in all the time just to play the jukebox. He was in love with the thing. Sat here by the hour listening to it. Course, when I say he was in love with it, I’m merely using a figure of speech, catch?”</p>
   <p>“Sure,” Foster said.</p>
   <p>“Then a couple of days ago he blows up. Crazy as a loon. I come in and find the guy on his knees in front of the jukebox, begging it to forgive him for something or other. I don’t get it. Some people shouldn’t drink, I guess. What’s yours?” ‘</p>
   <p>“The same,” Foster said, watching the ambulance men carry the stretcher out of the bar.</p>
   <p>“Just mild electric shock,” an intern said. “He’ll be all right.”</p>
   <p>The jukebox clicked, and a new record swung across. Something must have gone wrong with the amplification, for the song bellowed out with deafening intensity.</p>
   <p>” ‘Chlo-eee!’ ” screamed the jukebox urgently, ” ‘Chlo-eeee!’”</p>
   <p>Deafened, fighting the feeling that this was hallucination, Foster found himself beside the jukebox. He clung to it against the mad billows of sound. He shook it, and the roaring subsided.</p>
   <p>” ‘Chlo-eee!’” the jukebox sang softly and sweetly.</p>
   <p>There was confusion nearby, but Foster ignored it. He had been struck by an idea. He peered into the phonograph’s innards through the glass pane. The record was slowing now, and as the needle lifted Foster could read the title on the circular label.</p>
   <p>It said, “Springtime in the Rockies.”</p>
   <p>The record hastily lifted itself and swung back to concealment among the others in the rack. Another black disc moved over under the needle. It was “Twilight in Turkey.”</p>
   <p>But what the jukebox played, with great expression, was: “We’ll Always Be Sweethearts.”</p>
   <p>After a while the confusion died down. Austin came over, examined the phonograph, and made a note to get the broken panel replaced. Foster had entirely forgotten the fat, unshaven, untidy man till he heard an irritated voice behind him say:</p>
   <p>“It can’t be April!”</p>
   <p>“What?”</p>
   <p>“You’re a liar. It’s still March.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, take a walk,” said Foster, who was profoundly shaken, though he did not quite know why. The obvious reasons for his nervousness, he suspected, weren’t the real ones.</p>
   <p>“You’re a liar, I said,” the fat man snarled, breathing heavily in Foster’s face. “It’s March! You’ll either admit it’s March, or-or-”</p>
   <p>But Foster had had enough. He pushed the fat man away and had taken two steps when a tingling shock raced through him and the small, cold, spot of clarity sprang into existence within his brain.</p>
   <p>The jukebox started to play; “Accentuate the Positive, Eliminate the Negative.”</p>
   <p>“It’s March!” the fat man yelped. “Isn’t it March?”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Foster said thickly. “It’s March.”</p>
   <p>All that night the song-title blazed in his mind. He went home with the fat man. He drank with the fat man. He agreed with the fat man. He never used a negative. And, by morning, he was surprised to find that the fat man had hired him as a song-writer for Summit Studios, simply because Foster didn’t say no when he was asked whether he could write songs.</p>
   <p>“Good,” the fat man said. “Now I’d better get home. Oh, I am home, aren’t I? Well, I gotta go to the studio tomorrow. We’re starting a super-musical April second, and-This is April, isn’t it?”</p>
   <p>“Sure.”</p>
   <p>“Let’s get some sleep. No, not that door. The swimming-pool’s out there. Here, I’ll show you a spare bedroom. You’re sleepy, aren’t you?”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” said Foster, who wasn’t.</p>
   <p>But he slept, nevertheless, and the next morning found himself at Summit Studios with the fat man, putting his signature on a contract. Nobody asked his qualifications. Taliaferro, the fat man, had okayed him. That was enough. He was given an office with a piano and a secretary, and sat dazedly behind his desk for most of the day, wondering how the devil it had all happened. At the commissary, however, he picked up some scraps of information.</p>
   <p>Taliaferro was a big shot-a very big shot. He had one idiosyncrasy. He couldn’t endure disagreement. Only yes-men were allowed around him. Those who worked for Taliaferro had to accentuate the positive, eliminate the negative.</p>
   <p>Foster got his assignment. A romantic love song for the new picture. A duet. Everyone took it for granted that Foster knew one note from another. He did, having studied piano in his youth, but counterpoint and the mysteries of minor keys were far beyond him.</p>
   <p>That night he went back to the little downtown bar.</p>
   <p>It was just a hunch, but he thought the jukebox might be able to help him. Not that he really believed hi such things, but at worst, he could hoist a few shots and try to figure a way out. But the jukebox kept playing one song over and over.</p>
   <p>The odd thing was that nobody else heard that particular song. Foster discovered that quite by accident. To Austin’s ears, the jukebox was going through an ordinary repertoire of modern popular stuff.</p>
   <p>After that, Foster listened more closely. The song was a haunting duet, plaintive and curiously tender. It had overtones hi it that made Foster’s spine tingle.</p>
   <p>“Who wrote that thing?” he asked Austin.</p>
   <p>“Wasn’t it Hoagy Carmichael?”</p>
   <p>But they were talking at cross-purposes. The jukebox suddenly sang “I Dood It,” and then relapsed into the duet.</p>
   <p>“No,” Austin said. “I guess it wasn’t Hoagy. That’s an old one. ‘Dardanella.’”</p>
   <p>But it wasn’t “Dardanella.”</p>
   <p>Foster saw a piano at the back. He went to it and got out his notebook. First he wrote the lyrics. Then he tried to get the notes down, but they were beyond him, even with the piano as a guide. The best he could achieve was a sort of shorthand. His own voice was true and good, and he thought he might be able to sing the piece ao-curately, if he could find someone to put down the notes for him.</p>
   <p>When he finished, he studied the jukebox more closely. The broken panel had been repaired. He patted the gadget in a friendly way and went away thinking hard.</p>
   <p>His secretary’s name was Lois Kennedy. She came into his office the next day while Foster was tapping at the piano and helplessly endeavoring to write down the score.</p>
   <p>“Let me help you, Mr. Foster,” she said competently, casting a practised eye over the messy pages. “I-no, thanks^’ Foster said.</p>
   <p>“Are you bad on scores?” she asked as she smiled. “A lot of composers are that way. They play by ear, but they don’t know G sharp from A flat.” “They don’t, eh?” Foster murmured. The girl eyed him intently. “Suppose you run through it, and I’ll mark down a rough scoring.”</p>
   <p>Foster hit a few chords. “Phooey!” he said at last, and picked up the lyrics. Those were readable, anyway. He began to hum.</p>
   <p>“Swell,” Lois said. “Just sing it. I’ll catch the melody.” Foster’s voice was true, and he found it surprisingly easy to remember the love song the jukebox had played. He sang it, and Lois presently played it on the piano, while Foster corrected and revised. At least he could tell what was wrong and what was right. And, since Lois had h’ved music since her childhood, she had little difficulty in recording the song on paper.</p>
   <p>Afterwards she was enthusiastic. “It’s swell,” she said. “Something really new! Mr. Foster, you’re good. And you’re not lifting from Mozart, either. I’ll shoot this right over to the big boy. Usually it’s smart not to be hi too much of a hurry, but since this is your first job here, we’ll chance it.”</p>
   <p>Taliaferro liked the song. He made a few useless suggestions, which Foster, with Lois’s aid, incorporated, and sent down a list of what else was needed for the super-musical. He also called a conclave of the song-writers to listen to Foster’s opus.</p>
   <p>“I want you to hear what’s good,” Taliaferro told them. “This new find of mine is showing you up. I think we need new blood,” he finished darkly, eying the wretched song-writers with ominous intensity.</p>
   <p>But Foster quaked in his boots. For all he knew, his song might have been plagiarized. He expected someone in the audience to spring up and shout: “That new find of yours swiped his song from Berlin!” Or Gershwin or Porter or Hammerstein, as the case might be.</p>
   <p>Nobody exposed him. The song was new. It established Foster as a double-threat man, since he had done both melody and lyrics himself.</p>
   <p>He was a success.</p>
   <p>Every night he had his ritual. Alone, he visited a certain downtown bar. When necessary, the jukebox helped him with his songs. It seemed to know exactly what was needed. It asked little in return. It served him with the unquestioning fidelity of ‘Cigarette’ in “Under Two Flags.” And sometimes it played love songs aimed at Foster’s ears and heart. It serenaded him. Sometimes, too, Foster thought he was going crazy.</p>
   <p>Weeks passed. .Foster got all his assignments done at the little downtown bar, and later whipped them into suitable shape with his secretary’s assistance. He had begun to notice that she was a strikingly pretty girl, with attractive eyes and lips. Lois seemed amenable, but so far Foster had held back from any definite commitment. He felt unsure of his new triumphs.</p>
   <p>But he blossomed like the rose. His bank account grew fat, he looked sleeker and drank much less, and he visited the downtown bar every night. Once he asked Austin about it.</p>
   <p>“That jukebox. Where’d it come from?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know,” Austin said. “It was here before I came.”</p>
   <p>“Well, who puts new records in it?”</p>
   <p>“The company, I suppose.”</p>
   <p>“Ever see ‘em do it?”</p>
   <p>Austin thought. “Can’t say I have. I guess the man conies around when the other bartender’s on duty. It’s got a new set of records on every day, though. That’s good service.”</p>
   <p>Foster made a note to ask the other bartender about it. But there was no tune. For, the next day, he kissed Lois Kennedy.</p>
   <p>That was a mistake. It was the booster charge. The next thing Jerry Foster knew, he was making the rounds with Lois, and it was after dark, and they were driving unsteadily along the Sunset Strip, discussing life and music.</p>
   <p>“I’m going places,” Foster said, dodging an oddly ambulatory telephone pole. “We’re going places together.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, honey!” Lois said.</p>
   <p>Foster stopped the car and kissed her.</p>
   <p>“That calls for another drink,” he remarked. “Is that a bar over there?”</p>
   <p>The night wore on. Foster hadn’t realized he had been under a considerable strain. Now the lid was off. It was wonderful to have. Lois in his arms, to kiss her, to feel her hair brushing his cheek. Everything became rosy.</p>
   <p>Through the rosy mist he suddenly saw the face of Austin.</p>
   <p>“The same?” Austin inquired.</p>
   <p>Foster blinked. He was sitting in a booth, with Lois beside him. He had his arm around the girl, and he had an idea he had just kissed her.</p>
   <p>“Austin,” he said, “how long have we been here?” </p>
   <p>“About an hour. Don’t you remember, Mr. Foster?” </p>
   <p>“Darling,” Lois murmured, leaning heavily against her escort.</p>
   <p>Foster tried to think. If was difficult. “Lois,” he finally said, “haven’t I got another song to write?” </p>
   <p>“It’ll keep.”</p>
   <p>“No. That torch song. Taliaferro wants it Friday.” </p>
   <p>“That’s four days away.”</p>
   <p>“Now I’m here, I might as well get the song,” Foster said, with alcoholic insistence, and stood up.</p>
   <p>“Kiss me,” Lois murmured, leaning toward him. He obeyed, though he had a feeling that there was more important business to be attended to. Then he stared around, located the jukebox, and went toward it. “Hello, there,” he said, patting the sleek, glowing sides. “I’m back. Drunk, too. But that’s all right. Let’s have that song.”</p>
   <p>The jukebox was silent. Foster felt Lois touch his arm.</p>
   <p>“Come on back. We don’t want music.”</p>
   <p>“Wait a minute, hon.”</p>
   <p>Foster stared at the jukebox. Then he laughed.</p>
   <p>“I know,” he said, and pulled out a handful of change. He slid a nickel into the coin-lever and pushed the lever hard.</p>
   <p>Nothing happened.</p>
   <p>“Wonder what’s wrong with it?” Foster muttered. “I’ll need that song by Friday.”</p>
   <p>He decided that there were a lot of things he didn’t know about, and ought to. The muteness of the jukebox puzzled him.</p>
   <p>All of a sudden he remembered something that had happened weeks ago, the blond man who had attacked the the juke-box with a hatchet and had only got shocked for his pains. The blond man he vaguely recalled, used to spend hours en tete-a-tete with the jukebox.</p>
   <p>“What a dope!” Foster said thickly.</p>
   <p>Lois asked a question.</p>
   <p>“I should have checked up before,” he answered her. “Maybe I can find, oat-oh, nothing, Lois. Nothing at all.”</p>
   <p>Then he went after Austin. Austin gave him the blond man’s name and, an hour later, Foster found himself sitting by a white hospital bed, looking down at a man’s ravaged face under faded blond hair. Brashness, judicious tipping, and a statement that he was a relative had got him this far. Now he sat there and watched and felt questions die as they formed on his lips.</p>
   <p>When he finally mentioned the jukebox, it was easier. He simply sat and listened.</p>
   <p>“They carried me out of the bar on a stretcher,” the blond man said. “Then a car skidded and came right at me. I didn’t feel any pain. I still don’t feel anything. The driver-she said she’d heard somebody shouting her name. Chloe. That startled her so much she lost control, and hit me. You know who yelled ‘Chloe,’ don’t you?”</p>
   <p>Foster thought back. There was a memory somewhere.</p>
   <p>The jukebox had begun to play “Chloe,” and the amplification had gone haywire, so the song had bellowed out thunderously for a short time.</p>
   <p>“I’m paralyzed,” the blond man said. “I’m dying, too. I might as well. I think I’ll be safer. She’s vindictive and plenty smart.”</p>
   <p>“She?”</p>
   <p>“A spy. Maybe there’s all sorts of gadgets masquerading as-as things we take for granted. I don’t know. They substituted that jukebox for the original one. It’s alive. No, not it! She! It’s a she, all right!”</p>
   <p>And - “Who put her there?” The blond man said, in answer to Foster’s question. “Who are - they? People from another world or another time? Martians? They want information about us, I’ll bet, but they don’t dare appear personally. They plant gadgets that we’ll take for granted, like that jukebox, to act as spies. Only this one got out of control a little. She’s smarter than the others.”</p>
   <p>He pushed himself up on the pillow, his eyes glaring at the little radio beside him.</p>
   <p>“Even that!” he whispered. “Is that an ordinary, regular radio? Or is it one of their masquerading gadgets, spying on us?”</p>
   <p>He fell back.</p>
   <p>“I began to understand quite a while ago,” the man continued weakly. “She put the ideas in my head. More than once she pulled me out of a jam. Not now, though. She won’t forgive me. Oh, she’s feminine, all right. When I got on her bad side, I was sunk. She’s smart, for a jukebox. A mechanical brain? Or - I don’t know.</p>
   <p>“I’ll never know, now. I’ll be dead pretty soon. And that’ll be all right with me.”</p>
   <p>The nurse came in then….</p>
   <p>Jerry Foster was coldly frightened. And he was drunk. Main Street was bright and roaring as he walked back, but by the time he had made up his mind, it was after closing hour and a chill silence went hand in hand with the darkness. The street lights didn’t help much.</p>
   <p>“If I were sober I wouldn’t believe this,” he mused, listening to his hollow footfalls on the pavement. “But I do believe it. I’ve got to fix things up with that - jukebox!”</p>
   <p>Part of his mind guided him into an alley. Part of his mind told him to break a window, muffling the clash with his coat, and the same urgent, sober part of his mind guided him through a dark kitchen and a swinging door.</p>
   <p>Then he was in the bar. The booths were vacant. A faint, filtered light crept through the Venetian blinds shielding the street windows. Against a wall stood the black, silent bulk of the jukebox.</p>
   <p>Silent and unresponsive. Even when Foster inserted a nickel, nothing happened. The electric cord was plugged in the socket, and he threw the activating switch, but that made no difference.</p>
   <p>“Look,” he said. “I was drunk. Oh, this is crazy. It can’t be happening. You’re not alive - Are you alive? Did you put the finger on that guy I just saw in the hospital? Listen!”</p>
   <p>It was dark and cold. Bottles glimmered against the mirror behind the bar. Foster went over and opened one. He poured the whiskey down his throat.</p>
   <p>After a while, it didn’t seem so fantastic for him to be standing there arguing with a jukebox.</p>
   <p>“So you’re feminine,” he said. “I’ll bring you flowers tomorrow. I’m really beginning to believe! Of course I believe! I can’t write songs. Not by myself. You’ve got to help me. I’ll never look at a-another girl.”</p>
   <p>He tilted the bottle^again.</p>
   <p>“You’re just in the sulks,” he said. “You’ll come out of it. You love me. You know you do. This is crazy!”</p>
   <p>The bottle had mysteriously vanished. He went behind the bar to find another. Then, with a conviction that made him freeze motionless, he knew that there was someone else in the room.</p>
   <p>He was hidden in the shadows where he stood. Only his eyes moved as he looked toward the newcomers. There were two of them, and they were not human.</p>
   <p>They - moved - toward the jukebox, in a rather indescribable fashion. One of them pulled out a small, shining cylinder from the jukebox’s interior.</p>
   <p>Foster, sweat drying on his cheeks, could hear them thinking.</p>
   <p>“Current report for the last twenty-four hours, Earth time. Put in a fresh recording cylinder. Change the records, too.”</p>
   <p>Foster watched them change the records. Austin had said that the discs were replaced daily. And the blond man, dying in the hospital, had said other things. It couldn’t be real. The creatures he stared at could not exist. They blurred before his eyes.</p>
   <p>“A human is here,” one of them thought. “He has seen us. We had better eliminate him.”</p>
   <p>The blurry, inhuman figures came toward him. Foster, trying to scream, dodged around the end of the bar and ran toward the jukebox. He threw his arms around its unresponsive sides and gasped:</p>
   <p>“Stop them! Don’t let them kill me!”</p>
   <p>He couldn’t see the creatures now but he knew that they were immediately behind him. The clarity of panic sharpened his vision. One title on the jukebox’s list of records stood out vividly. He thrust his forefinger against the black button beside the title “Love Me Forever.”</p>
   <p>Something touched his shoulder and tightened, drawing him back.</p>
   <p>Lights flickered within the jukebox. A record swung out. The needle lowered into its black groove.</p>
   <p>The jukebox started to play “I’ll Be Glad When You’re Dead, You Rascal You.”</p>

    <p>THE EGO MACHINE</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>NICHOLAS MARTIN looked up at the robot across the desk.</p>
   <p>“I’m not going to ask what you want,” he said, in a</p>
   <p>low, restrained voice. “I already know. Just go away and tell St. Cyr I approve. Tell him I think it’s wonderful, putting a robot in the picture. We’ve had everything else by now, except the Rockettes. But clearly a quiet little play about Christmas” among the Portuguese fishermen on the Florida coast must have a robot. Only, why not six robots? Tell him I suggest a baker’s dozen. Go away.”</p>
   <p>“Was your mothers’ name Helena Glinska?” the robot asked, paying no heed to Martin’s remarks.</p>
   <p>“It was not,” Martin said.</p>
   <p>“Ah, then she must have been the Great Hairy One,” the robot murmured.</p>
   <p>Martin took his feet off the desk and sat up slowly.</p>
   <p>“It’s quite all right,” the robot said hastily. “You’ve been chosen for an ecological experiment, that’s all. But it won’t hurt. Robots are perfectly normal life forms where I come from, so you needn’t -”</p>
   <p>“Shut up,” Martin said. “Robot indeed, you - you bit-player! This tune St. Cyr has gone too far.” He began to shake slightly all over, with some repressed but strong emotion. The intercom box on the desk caught his eye, and he stabbed a finger at one of the switches. “Get me Miss Ashby! Right away!”</p>
   <p>“I’m so sorry,” the robot said apologetically. “Have I made a mistake? The threshold fluctuations in the neurons always upset my mnemonic norm when I temporalize. Isn’t this a crisis-point in your life?”</p>
   <p>Martin breathed hard, which seemed to confirm the robot’s assumption.</p>
   <p>“Exactly,” it said. “The ecological imbalance approaches a peak that may destroy the life-form, unless … mm-m. Now either you’re about to be stepped on by’ a mammoth, locked hi an iron mask, assassinated by helots, or-is this Sanskrit I’m speaking?” He shook his gleaming head. “Perhaps I should have got off fifty years ago, but I thought-sorry. Goodbye,” he added hastily as Martin raised an angry glare.</p>
   <p>Then the robot lifted a finger to each corner of his naturally rigid mouth, and moved his fingers horizontally in opposite directions, as though sketching an apologetic smile.</p>
   <p>“No, don’t go away,” Martin said. “I want you right here, where the sight of you can refuel my rage in case it’s needed. I wish to God I could get mad and stay mad,” he added plaintively, gazing at the telephone.</p>
   <p>“Are you sure your mother’s name wasn’t Helena Glinska?” the robot asked. It pinched thumb and forefinger together between its nominal brows, somehow giving the impression of a worried frown.</p>
   <p>“Naturally, I’m sure,” Martin snapped.</p>
   <p>“You aren’t married yet, then? To Anastasia Zakharina-Koshkina?”</p>
   <p>“Not yet or ever,” Martin replied succinctly. The telephone rang. He snatched it up.</p>
   <p>“Hello, Nick,” said Erika Ashby’s calm voice. “Something wrong?”</p>
   <p>Instantly the fires of rage went out of Martin’s eyes, to be replaced by a tender, rose-pink glow. For some years now he had given Erika, his very competent agent, ten per cent of his take. He had also longed hopelessly to give her approximately a pound of flesh-the cardiac muscle, to put it in cold, unromantic terms. Martin did not; he put it in no terms at all, since whenever he tried to propose marriage to Erika he was taken with such fits of modesty that he could only babble o’ green fields.</p>
   <p>“Well,” Erika repeated. “Something wrong?”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Martin said, drawing a long breath. “Can St. Cyr make me marry somebody named Anastasia Zakharina-Koshkina?”</p>
   <p>“What a wonderful memory you have,” the robot put hi mournfully. “Mine used to be, before I started temporalizing. But even radioactive neurons won’t stand-”</p>
   <p>“Nominally you’re still entitled to life, liberty, et cetera,” Erika said. “But I’m busy right now, Nick. Can’t it wait till I see you?”</p>
   <p>“When?”</p>
   <p>“Didn’t you get my message?” Erika demanded.</p>
   <p>“Of course not,” Martin said, angrily. “I’ve suspected for some time that all my incoming calls have to be cleared by St. Cyr. Somebody might try to smuggle hi a word of hope, or possibly a file.” His voice brightened. “Planning a jailbreak?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, this is outrageous,” Erika said. “Some day St. Cyr’s going to go too far -”</p>
   <p>“Not while he’s got DeeDee behind him,” Martin said gloomily. Summit Studios would sooner have made a film promoting atheism than offend their top box-office star, DeeDee Fleming. Even Tolh’ver Watt, who owned Summit lock, stock and barrel, spent wakeful nights because St. Cyr refused to let the lovely DeeDee sign a long-term contract.</p>
   <p>“Nevertheless, Watt’s no fool,” Erika said. “I still think we could get him to give you a contract release if we could make him realize what a rotten investment you are. There isn’t much time, though.”</p>
   <p>“Why not?”</p>
   <p>“I told you - off. Of course you don’t know. He’s leaving for Paris tomorrow morning.”</p>
   <p>Martin moaned. “Then I’m doomed,” he said. “They’ll pick up my option automatically next week and I’ll never draw a free breath again. Erika, do something!”</p>
   <p>“I’m going to,” Erika said. “That’s exactly what I want to see you about. Ah,” she added suddenly, “now I understand why St. Cyr stopped my message. He was afraid. Nick, do you know what we’ve got to do?”</p>
   <p>“See Watt?” Nick hazarded unhappily. “But Erika-”</p>
   <p>“See Watt alone,” Erika amplified.</p>
   <p>“Not if St. Cyr can help it,” Nick reminded her.</p>
   <p>“Exactly. Naturally St. Cyr doesn’t want us to talk to Watt privately. We might make him see reason. But this time, Nick, we’ve simply got to manage it somehow. One of us is going to talk to Watt while the other keeps St. Cyr at bay. Which do you choose?”</p>
   <p>“Neither,” Martin said promptly.</p>
   <p>“Oh, Nick! I can’t do the whole thing alone. Anybody’d think you were afraid of St. Cyr.”</p>
   <p>“I am afraid of St. Cyr,” Martin said.</p>
   <p>“Nonsense. What could he actually do to you?”</p>
   <p>“He could terrorize me. He does it all the time. Erika, he says I’m indoctrinating beautifully. Doesn’t it make your blood run cold? Look at all the other writers he’s indoctrinated.”</p>
   <p>“I know. I saw one of them on Main Street last week, delving into garbage cans. Do you want to end up that way? Then stand up for your rights!”</p>
   <p>“Ah,” said the robot wisely, nodding. “Just as I thought. A crisis-point.”</p>
   <p>“Shut up,” Martin said. “No, not you, Erika. I’m sorry.”</p>
   <p>“So am I,” Erika said tartly. “For a moment I thought you’d acquired a backbone.”</p>
   <p>“If I were somebody like Hemingway -” Martin began in a miserable voice.</p>
   <p>“Did you say Hemingway?” the robot inquired. “Is this the Kinsey-Hemingway era? Then I must be right. You’re Nicholas Martin, the next subject. Martin, Martin? Let me see-oh yes, the Disraeli type, that’s it.” He rubbed his forehead with a grating sound. “Oh, my poor neuron thresholds! Now I remember.”</p>
   <p>“Nick, can you hear me?” Erika’s voice inquired. “I’m coming over there right away. Brace yourself. We’re going to beard St. Cyr in his den and convince Watt you’ll never make a good screen-writer. Now -”</p>
   <p>“But St. Cyr won’t ever admit that,” Martin cried. “He doesn’t know the meaning of the word failure. He says so. He’s going to make me into a screen-writer or kill me.”</p>
   <p>“Remember what happened to Ed Cassidy?” Erika reminded him grimly. “St. Cyr didn’t make him into a screen-writer.” ‘</p>
   <p>“True. Poor old Ed,” Martin said, with a shiver.</p>
   <p>“All right, then. I’m on my way. Anything else?”</p>
   <p>“Yes!” Martin cried, drawing a deep breath. “Yes, there is! I love you madly!”</p>
   <p>But the words never got past his glottis. Opening and closing his mouth noiselessly, the cowardly playwright finally clenched his teeth and tried again. A faint, hopeless squeak vibrated the telephone’s disk. Martin let his shoulders slump hopelessly. It was clear he could never propose to anybody, not even a harmless telephone.</p>
   <p>“Did you say something?” Erika asked. “Well, goodbye then.”</p>
   <p>“Wait a minute,” Martin said, his eyes suddenly falling once more upon the robot. Speechless on one subject only, he went on rapidly, “I forgot to tell you. Watt and the nest-fouling St. Cyr have just hired a mock-up phony robot to play in Angelina Noel!”</p>
   <p>But the line was dead.</p>
   <p>“I’m not a phony,” the robot said, hurt.</p>
   <p>Martin fell back in his chair and stared at his guest with dull, hopeless eyes. “Neither was King Kong,” he remarked. “Don’t start feeding me some line St. Cyr’s told you to pull. I know he’s trying to break my nerve. He’ll probably do it, too. Look what he’s done to my play already. Why Fred Waring? I don’t mind Fred Waring in his proper place. There he’s fine. But not in Angelina Noel. Not as the Portuguese captain of a fishing boat manned by his entire band, accompanied by Dan Dailey singing Napoli to DeeDee Fleming in a mermaid’s tail-”</p>
   <p>Self-stunned by this recapitulation, Martin put his arms on the desk, his head in his hands, and to his horror found himself giggling. The telephone rang. Martin groped for the instrument without rising from his semi-recumbent position. *</p>
   <p>“Who?” he asked shakily. “Who? St. Cyr -”</p>
   <p>A hoarse bellow came over the wire. Martin sat bolt upright, seizing the phone desperately with both hands.</p>
   <p>“Listen!” he cried. “Will you let me finish what I’m going to say, just for once? Putting a robot in Angelina Noel is simply-”</p>
   <p>“I do not hear what you say,” roared a heavy voice. “Your idea stinks. Whatever it is. Be at Theater One for yesterday’s rushes. At once!”</p>
   <p>“But wait -”</p>
   <p>St. Cyr belched and hung up. Martin’s strangling hands tightened briefly on the telephone. But it was no use. The real strangle-hold was the one St. Cyr had around Martin’s throat, and it had been tightening now for nearly thirteen weeks. Or had it been thirteen years? Looking backward, Martin could scarcely believe that only a short time ago he had been a free man, a successful Broadway playwright, the author of the hit play Angelina Noel. Then had come St. Cyr. …</p>
   <p>A snob at heart, the director loved getting his clutches on hit plays and name writers. Summit Studios, he had roared at Martin, would follow the original play exactly and would give Martin the final okay on the script, provided he signed a thirteen-week contract to help write the screen treatment. This had seemed too good to be true-and was.</p>
   <p>Martin’s downfall lay partly in the fine print and partly in the fact that Erika Ashby had been in the hospital with a bad attack of influenza at the time. Buried in legal verbiage was a clause that bound Martin to five years of servitude with Summit should they pick up his option. Next week they would certainly do just that, unless justice prevailed.</p>
   <p>“I think I need a drink,” Martin said unsteadily. “Or several.” He glanced toward the robot. “I wonder if you’d mind getting me that bottle of Scotch from the bar over there.”</p>
   <p>“But I am here to conduct an experiment on optimum ecology,” said the robot.</p>
   <p>Martin closed his eyes. “Pour me a drink,” he pleaded.</p>
   <p>“Please. Then put the glass in my hand, will you? It’s not much to ask. After all, we’re both human beings, aren’t we?”</p>
   <p>“Well, no,” the robot said, placing a brimming glass in Martin’s groping fingers. Martin drank. Then he opened his eyes and blinked at the tall highball glass in his hand. The robot had filled it to the brim with Scotch. Martin turned a wondering gaze on his metallic companion.</p>
   <p>“You must do a lot of drinking yourself,” he said thoughtfully. “I suppose tolerance can be built up. Go ahead. Help yourself. Take the rest of the bottle.”</p>
   <p>The robot placed the tip of a finger above each eye and slid the fingers upward, as though raising his eyebrows inquiringly.</p>
   <p>“Go on, have a jolt,” Martin urged. “Or don’t you want to break bread with me, under the circumstances?”</p>
   <p>“How can I?” the robot asked. “I’m a robot.” His voice sounded somewhat wistful. “What happens?” he inquired. “Is it a lubricatory or a fueling mechanism?”</p>
   <p>Martin glanced at his brimming glass.</p>
   <p>“Fueling,” he said tersely. “High octane. You really believe in staying in character, don’t you? Why not -”</p>
   <p>“Oh, the principle of irritation,” the robot interrupted. “I see. Just like fermented mammoth’s milk.”</p>
   <p>Martin choked. “Have you ever drunk fermented mammoth’s milk?” he inquired.</p>
   <p>“How could I?” the robot asked. “But I’ve seen it done.” He drew a straight line vertically upward between his invisible eyebrows, managing to look wistful. “Of course my world is perfectly functional and functionally perfect, but I can’t help finding temporalizing a fascina -” He broke off. “I’m wasting space-time. Ah. Now. Mr. Martin, would you be willing to -”</p>
   <p>“Oh, have a drink,” Martin said. “I feel hospitable. Go ahead, indulge me, will you? My pleasures are few. And I’ve got to go and be terrorized in a minute, anyhow. If you can’t get that mask off I’ll send for a straw. You can step out of character long enough for one jolt, can’t you?”</p>
   <p>“I’d like to try it,” the robot said pensively. “Ever since I noticed the effect fermented mammoth’s milk had on the boys, it’s been on my mind, rather. Quite easy for a human, of course. Technically it’s simple enough, I see now. The irritation just increases the frequency of the brain’s kappa waves, as with boosted voltage, but since electrical voltage never existed in pre-robot times -”</p>
   <p>“It did,” Martin said, taking another drink. “I mean, it does. What do you call that, a mammoth?” He indicated the desk lamp.</p>
   <p>The robot’s jaw dropped.</p>
   <p>“That?” he asked in blank amazement. “Why-why then all those telephone poles and dynamos and lighting-equipment I noticed in this era are powered by electricity!”</p>
   <p>“What did you think they were powered by?” Martin asked coldly.</p>
   <p>“Slaves,” the robot said, examining the lamp. He switched it on, bunked, and then unscrewed the bulb. “Voltage, you say?”</p>
   <p>“Don’t be a fool,” Martin said. “You’re overplaying your part. I’ve got to get going in a minute. Do you want a jolt or don’t you?”</p>
   <p>“Well,” the robot said, “I don’t want to seem unsociable. This ought to work.” So saying, he stuck his finger in the lamp-socket. There was a brief, crackling flash. The robot withdrew his finger.</p>
   <p>“F(t)-” he said, and swayed slightly. Then his fingers came up and sketched a smile that seemed, somehow, to express delighted surprise.</p>
   <p>“Fff(t)t” he said, and went on rather thickly, “F(t) integral between plus and minus infinity . . ; a-sub-n to e… .”</p>
   <p>Martin’s eyes opened wide with shocked horror. Whether a doctor or a psychiatrist should be called in was debatable, but it was perfectly evident that this was a case for the medical profession, and the sooner the better. Perhaps the police, too. The bit-player in the robot suit was clearly as mad as a hatter. Martin poised indecisively, waiting for his lunatic guest either to drop dead or spring at his throat.</p>
   <p>The robot appeared to be smacking his lips, with faint clicking sounds.</p>
   <p>“Why, that’s wonderful,” he said. “AC, too.”</p>
   <p>“Y-you’re not dead?” Martin inquired shakily.</p>
   <p>“I’m not even alive,” the robot murmured. “The way you’d understand it, that is. Ah-thanks for the jolt.”</p>
   <p>Martin stared at the robot with the wildest dawning of surmise.</p>
   <p>“Why-” he gasped. “Why-you’re a robot!”</p>
   <p>“Certainly I’m a robot,” his guest said. “What slow minds you pre-robots had. Mine’s working like lightning now.” He stole a drunkard’s glance at the desk-lamp. “F(t)-I mean, if you counted the kappa waves of my radio-atomic brain now, you’d be amazed how the frequency’s increased.” He paused thoughtfully. “F(t),” he added.</p>
   <p>Moving quite slowly, like a man under water, Martin lifted his glass and drank whiskey. Then, cautiously, he looked up at the robot again.</p>
   <p>“F(t)-” he said, paused, shuddered, and drank again. That did it. “I’m drunk,” he said with an air of shaken relief. “That must be it. I was almost beginning to believe -”</p>
   <p>“Oh, nobody believes I’m a robot at first,” the robot said. “You’ll notice I showed up in a movie lot, where I wouldn’t arouse suspicion. I’ll appear to Ivan Vasilovich in an alchemist’s lab, and he’ll jump to the conclusion I’m an automaton. Which, of course, I am. Then there’s a Uighur on my list - I’ll appear to him in a shaman’s hut and he’ll assume I’m a devil. A matter of ecologico-logic.”</p>
   <p>“Then you’re a devil?” Martin inquired, seizing on the only plausible solution.</p>
   <p>“No, no, no. I’m a robot. Don’t you understand anything?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t even know who I am, now,” Martin said. “For all I know, I’m a faun and you’re a human child. I don’t think this Scotch is doing me as much good as I’d -”</p>
   <p>“Your name is Nicholas Martin,” the robot said patiently. “And mine is ENIAC.”</p>
   <p>“Eniac?”</p>
   <p>“ENIAC,” the robot corrected, capitalizing. “ENIAC Gamma the Ninety-Third.”</p>
   <p>So saying, he unslung a sack from his metallic shoulder and began to rummage out length upon length of what looked like red silk ribbon with a curious metallic lustre. After approximately a quarter-mile of it had appeared, a crystal football helmet emerged attached to its end. A gleaming red-green stone was set on each side of the helmet.</p>
   <p>“Just over the temporal lobes, you see,” the robot explained, indicating the jewels. “Now you just set it on your head, like this -”</p>
   <p>“Oh, no, I don’t,” Martin said, withdrawing his head with the utmost rapidity. “Neither do you, my friend. What’s the idea? I don’t like the looks of that gimmick. I particularly don’t like those two red garnets on the sides. They look like eyes.”</p>
   <p>“Those are artificial eclogite,” the robot assured him. “They simply have a high dielectric constant. It’s merely a matter of altering the normal thresholds of the neuron memory-circuits. All thinking is based on memory, you know. The strength of your associations-the emotional indices of your memories - channel your actions and decisions, and the ecologizer simply changes the voltage of your brain so the thresholds are altered.”</p>
   <p>“Is that all it does?” Martin asked suspiciously.</p>
   <p>“Well, now,” the robot said with a slight air of evasion. “I didn’t intend to mention it, but since you ask-it also imposes the master-matrix of your character type. But since that’s the prototype of your character in the first place, it will simply enable you to make the most of your potential ability, hereditary and acquired. It will make you react to your environment in the way that best assures your survival.”</p>
   <p>“Not me, it won’t,” Martin said firmly. “Because you aren’t going to put that thing on my head.”</p>
   <p>The robot sketched a puzzled frown. “Oh,” he said after a pause. “I haven’t explained yet, have I? It’s very simple. Would you be willing to take part in a valuable socio-cultural experiment for the benefit of all mankind?”</p>
   <p>“No,” Martin said.</p>
   <p>“But you don’t know what it is yet,” the robot said plaintively. “You’ll be the only one to refuse, after I’ve explained everything thoroughly. By the way, can you understand me all right?”</p>
   <p>Martin laughed hollowly. “Natch,” he said.</p>
   <p>“Good,” the robot said, relieved. “That may be one trouble with my memory. I had to record so many languages before I could temporalize. Sanskrit’s very simple, but medieval Russian’s confusing, and as for Uighur - however! The purpose of this experiment is to promote the most successful pro-survival relationship between man and his environment. Instant adaptation is what we’re aiming at, and we hope to get it by minimizing the differential between individual and environment. In other words, the right reaction at the right time. Understand?</p>
   <p>“Of course not,” Martin said. “What nonsense you talk.”</p>
   <p>“There are,” the robot said rather wearily, “only a limited number of character matrices possible, depending first on the arrangement of the genes within the chromosomes, and later upon environmental additions. Since environments tend to repeat-like societies, you know-an organizational pattern isn’t hard to lay out, along the Kaldekooz time-scale. You follow me so far?”</p>
   <p>“By the Kaldekooz time-scale, yes,” Martin said.</p>
   <p>“I was always lucid,” the robot remarked a little vainly, flourishing a swirl of red ribbon.</p>
   <p>“Keep that thing away from me,” Martin complained. “Drunk I may be, but - I have no intention of sticking my neck out that far.”</p>
   <p>“Of course you’ll do it,” the robot said firmly. “Nobody’s ever refused yet. And don’t bicker with me or you’ll get me confused and I’ll have to take another jolt of voltage. Then there’s no telling how confused I’ll be. My memory gives me enough trouble when I temporalize. Time-travel always raises the synaptic delay threshold, but the trouble is it’s so variable. That’s why I got you mixed up with Ivan at first. But I don’t visit him till after I’ve seen you-I’m running the test chronologically, and nineteen-fifty-two comes before fifteen-seventy, of course.”</p>
   <p>“It doesn’t,” Martin said, tilting the glass to his lips. “Not even in Hollywood does nineteen-fifty-two come before fifteen-seventy.”</p>
   <p>“I’m using the Kaldekooz time-scale,” the robot explained. “But really only for convenience. Now do you want the ideal ecological differential or don’t you? Because-” Here he flourished the red ribbon again, peered into the helmet, looked narrowly at Martin, and shook his head.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry,” the robot said. “I’m afraid this won’t work. Your head’s too small. Not enough brain-room, I suppose. This helmet’s for an eight and a half head, and yours is much too -”</p>
   <p>“My head is eight and a half,” Martin protested with dignity.</p>
   <p>“Can’t be,” the robot said cunningly. “If it were, the helmet would fit, and it doesn’t. Too big.”</p>
   <p>“It does fit,” Martin said.</p>
   <p>“That’s the trouble with arguing with pre-robot species,” ENIAC said, as to himself. “Low, brutish, unreasoning. No wonder, when their heads are so small. Now Mr. Martin -” .He spoke as though to a small, stupid, stubborn child. “Try to understand. This helmet’s size eight and a half. Your head is unfortunately so very small that the helmet wouldn’t fit -”</p>
   <p>“Blast it!” cried the infuriated Martin, caution quite lost between Scotch and annoyance. “It does fit! Look here!” Recklessly he snatched the helmet and clapped it firmly on his head. “It fits perfectly!”</p>
   <p>“I erred,” the robot acknowledged^ with such a gleam in his eye that Martin, suddenly conscious of his rashness, jerked the helmet from his head and dropped it on the desk. ENIAC quietly picked it up and put it back into his sack, stuffing the red ribbon hi after it with rapid motions. Martin watched, baffled, until ENIAC had finished, gathered together the mouth of the sack, swung it on his shoulder again, and turned toward the door.</p>
   <p>“Goodbye,” the robot said. “And thank you.”</p>
   <p>“For what?” Martin demanded.</p>
   <p>“For your cooperation,” the robot said.</p>
   <p>“I won’t cooperate,” Martin told him flatly. “It’s no use. Whatever fool treatment it is you’re selling, I’m not going to -”</p>
   <p>“Oh, you’ve already had the ecology treatment,” ENIAC replied blandly. “I’ll be back tonight to renew the charge. It lasts only twelve hours.”</p>
   <p>“What!”</p>
   <p>ENIAC moved his forefingers outward from the corners of his mouth, sketching a polite smile. Then he stepped through the door and closed it behind him.</p>
   <p>Martin made a faint squealing sound, like a stuck but gagged pig.</p>
   <p>Something was happening inside his head.</p>
   <p>Nicholas Martin felt like a man suddenly thrust under an ice-cold shower. No, not cold-steaming hot. Perfumed, too. The wind that blew in from the open window bore with it a frightful stench of gasoline, sagebrush, paint, and-from the distant commissary-ham sandwiches.</p>
   <p>“Drunk,” he thought frantically. “I’m drunk - or crazy!” He sprang up and spun around wildly; then catching sight of a crack in the hardwood floor he tried to walk along it. “Because if I can walk a straight line,” he thought, “I’m not drunk. I’m only crazy …” It was not a very comforting thought.</p>
   <p>He could walk it, all right. He could walk a far straighter line than the crack, which he saw now was microscopically jagged. He had, in fact, never felt such a sense of location and equilibrium in his life. His experiment carried him across the room to a wall-mirror, and as he straightened to look into it, suddenly all confusion settled and ceased. The violent sensory perceptions leveled off and returned to normal.</p>
   <p>Everything was quiet. Everything was all right.</p>
   <p>Martin met his own eyes in the mirror.</p>
   <p>Everything was not all right.</p>
   <p>He was stone cold sober. The Scotch he had drunk might as well have been spring-water. He leaned closer to the mirror, trying to stare through his own eyes into the depths of his brain. For something extremely odd was happening hi there. All over his brain, tiny shutters were beginning to move, some sliding up till only a narrow crack remained, through which the beady little eyes of neurons could be seen peeping, some sliding down with fault crashes, revealing the agile, spidery forms of still other neurons scuttling for cover.</p>
   <p>Altered thresholds, changing the yes-and-no reaction time of the memory-circuits, with their key emotional indices and associations … huh?</p>
   <p>The robot!</p>
   <p>Martin’s head swung toward the closed office door. But he made no further move. The look of blank panic on his face very slowly, quite unconsciously, began to change. The robot… could wait.</p>
   <p>Automatically Martin raised his hand, as though to adjust an invisible monocle. Behind him, the telephone began to ring. Martin glanced at it.</p>
   <p>His lips curved into an insolent smile.</p>
   <p>Flicking dust from his lapel with a suave gesture, Martin picked up the telephone. He said nothing. There was a long silence. Then a hoarse voice shouted, “Hello, hello, hello! Are you there? You, Martin.”</p>
   <p>Martin said absolutely nothing at all.</p>
   <p>“You keep me waiting,” the voice bellowed. “Me, St. Cyr! Now jump! The rushes are … Martin, do you hear me?”</p>
   <p>Martin gently laid down the receiver on the desk. He turned again toward the mirror, regarded himself critically, frowned.</p>
   <p>“Dreary,” he murmured. “Distinctly dreary. I wonder why I ever bought this necktie?”</p>
   <p>The softly bellowing telephone distracted him. He studied the instrument briefly, then clapped his hands sharply together an inc^ from the mouthpiece. There was a sharp, anguished cry from the other end of the line.</p>
   <p>“Very good,” Martin murmured, turning away. “That robot has done me a considerable favor. I should have realized the possibilities sooner. After all, a super-machine, such as ENIAC, would be far cleverer than a man, who is merely an ordinary machine. Yes,” he added, stepping into the hall and coming face to face with Toni LaMotta, who was currently working for Summit on loan. ” ‘Man is a machine, and woman -‘ ” Here he gave Miss LaMotta a look of such arrogant significance that she was quite startled.</p>
   <p>” ‘And woman - a toy,’” Martin amplified, as he turned toward Theater One, where St. Cyr and destiny awaited him.</p>
   <p>Summit Studios, outdoing even MGM, always shot ten times as much footage as necessary on every scene. At the beginning of each shooting day, this confusing mass of celluloid was shown hi St. Cyr’s private projection theater, a small but luxurious domed room furnished with lie-back chairs, and every other convenience, though no screen was visible until you looked up. Then you saw it on the ceiling.</p>
   <p>When Martin entered, it was instantly evident that ecology took a sudden shift toward the worse. Operating on the theory that the old Nicholas Martin had come into it, the theater, which had breathed an expensive air of luxurious confidence, chilled toward him. The nap of the Persian rug shrank from his contaminating feet. The chair he stumbled against in the half-light seemed to shrug contemptuously. And the three people in the theater gave him such a look as might be turned upon one of the larger apes who had, by sheer accident, got an invitation to Buckingham Palace.</p>
   <p>DeeDee Fleming (her real name was impossible to remember, besides having not a vowel hi it) lay placidly in her chair, her feet comfortably up, her lovely hands folded, her large, liquid gaze fixed upon the screen where DeeDee Fleming, in the silvery meshes of a technicolor mermaid, swam phlegmatically through seas of pearl-colored mist.</p>
   <p>Martin groped in the gloom for a chair. The strangest things were going on inside his brain, where tiny stiles still moved and readjusted until he no longer felt in the least like Nicholas Martin. Who did he feel like, then? What had happened?</p>
   <p>He recalled the neurons whose beady little eyes he had fancied he saw staring brightly into, as well as out of, his own. Or had he? The memory was vivid, yet it couldn’t be, of course. The answer was perfectly simple and terribly logical. ENIAC Gamma the Ninety-Third had told him, somewhat ambiguously, just what his ecological experiment involved. Martin had merely been given the optimum reactive pattern of his successful prototype, a man who had most thoroughly controlled his own environment. And ENIAC had told him the man’s name, along with several confusing references to other prototypes like an Ivan (who?) and an unnamed Uighur.</p>
   <p>The name for Martin’s prototype was, of course, Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield. Martin had a vivid recollection of George Arliss playing the role. Clever, insolent, eccentric hi dress and manner, exuberant, suave, self-controlled, with a strongly perceptive imagination… .</p>
   <p>“No, no, no!” DeeDee said with a sort of calm impatience. “Be careful, Nick. Some other chair, please. I have my feet on this one.”</p>
   <p>“T-t-t-t-t,” said Raoul St. Cyr, protruding his thick lips and snapping the fingers of an enormous hand as he pointed to a lowly chair against the wall. “Behind me, Martin. Sit down, sit down. Out of our way. Now! Pay attention. Study what I have done to make something great out of your foolish little play. Especially note how I have so cleverly ended the solo by building to five cumulative pratt-falls. Timing is all,” he finished. “Now -SILENCE!”</p>
   <p>For a man born in the obscure little Balkan country of Mixo-Lydia, Raoul St. Cyr had done very well for himself in Hollywood. In 1939 St. Cyr, growing alarmed at the imminence of war, departed for America, taking with him the print of an unpronounceable Mixo-Lydian film he had made, which might be translated roughly as The Pores in the Face of the Peasant.</p>
   <p>With this he established his artistic reputation as a great director, though if the truth were known, it was really poverty that caused The Pores to be so artistically lighted, and simple drunkenness which had made most of the cast act out one of the strangest performances in film history. But critics compared The Pores to a ballet and praised inordinately the beauty of its leading lady, now known to the world as DeeDee Fleming.</p>
   <p>DeeDee was so incredibly beautiful that the law of compensation would force one to expect incredible stupidity as well. One was not disappointed. DeeDee’s neurons didn’t know anything. She had heard of emotions, and under St. Cyr’s bullying could imitate a few of them, but other directors had gone mad trying to get through the semantic block that kept DeeDee’s mind a calm, unruffled pool possibly three inches deep. St. Cyr merely bellowed. This simple, primordial approach seemed to be the only one that made sense to Summit’s greatest investment and top star.</p>
   <p>With this whip-hand over the beautiful and brainless DeeDee, St. Cyr quickly rose to the top in Hollywood. He had undoubted talent. He could make one picture very well indeed. He had made it twenty tunes already, each time starring DeeDee, and each time perfecting his own feudalistic production unit. Whenever anyone disagreed with St. Cyr, he had only to threaten to go over to MGM and take the obedient DeeDee with him, for he had never allowed her to sign a long-term contract and she worked only on a picture-to-picture basis. Even Tolliver Watt knuckled under when St. Cyr voiced the threat of removing DeeDee.</p>
   <p>“Sit down, Martin,” Tolliver Watt said. He was a tall, lean, hatchet-faced man who looked like a horse being starved because he was too proud to eat hay. With calm, detached omnipotence he inclined his gray-shot head a millimeter, while a faintly pained expression passed fleetingly across his face.</p>
   <p>“Highball, please,” he said.</p>
   <p>A white-clad waiter appeared noiselessly from nowhere and glided forward with a tray. It was at this point that Martha felt the last stiles readjust in his brain, and entirely on impulse he reached out and took the frosted highball glass from the tray. Without observing this the waiter glided on and presented Watt with a gleaming salver full of nothing. Watt and the waiter regarded the tray.</p>
   <p>Then their eyes met. There was a brief silence.</p>
   <p>“Here,” Martin said, replacing the glass. “Much too weak. Get me another, please. I’m reorienting toward a new phase which means a different optimum,” he explained to the puzzled Watt as he readjusted a chair beside the great man and dropped into it. Odd that he had never before felt at ease during rushes. Right now he felt fine. Perfectly at ease. Relaxed.</p>
   <p>“Scotch and soda for Mr. Martin,” Watt said calmly. “And another for me.”</p>
   <p>“So, so, so, now we begin,” St. Cyr cried impatiently. He spoke into a hand microphone. Instantly the screen on the ceiling flickered noisily and began to unfold a series of rather ragged scenes in which a chorus of mermaids danced on their tails down the street of a little Florida fishing village.</p>
   <p>To understand the full loathsomeness of the fate facing Nicholas Martin, it is necessary to view a St. Cyr production. It seemed to Martin that he was watching the most noisome movie ever put upon film. He was conscious that St. Cyr and Watt were stealing rather mystified glances at him. In the dark he put up two fingers and sketched a robot-like grin. Then, feeling sublimely sure of himself, he lit a cigarette and chuckled aloud.</p>
   <p>“You laugh?” St. Cyr demanded with instant displeasure. “You do not appreciate great art? What do you know about it, eh? Are you a genius?”</p>
   <p>“This,” Martin said urbanely, “is the most noisome movie ever put on film.”</p>
   <p>In the sudden, deathly quiet which followed, Martin flicked ashes elegantly and added, “With my help, you may yet avoid becoming the laughing stock of the whole continent. Every foot of this picture must be junked. Tomorrow bright and early we will start all over, and -”</p>
   <p>Watt said quietly, “We’re quite competent to make a film out of Angelina Noel, Martin.”</p>
   <p>“It is artistic!” St. Cyr shouted. “And it will make money, too!”</p>
   <p>“Bah, money!” Martin said cunningly. He rucked more ash with a lavish gesture. “Who cares about money? Let Summit worry.”</p>
   <p>Watt leaned forward to peer searchingly at Martin in the dimness.</p>
   <p>“Raoul,” he said, glancing at St. Cyr, “I understand you were getting your-ah-your new writers whipped into shape. This doesn’t sound to me as if-”</p>
   <p>“Yes, yes, yes, yes,” St. Cyr cried excitedly. “Whipped into shape, exactly! A brief delirium, eh? Martin, you feel well? You feel yourself?”</p>
   <p>Martin laughed with quiet confidence. “Never fear,” he said. “The money you spend on me is well worth what I’ll bring you in prestige. I quite understand. Our confidential talks were not to be secret from Watt, of course.”</p>
   <p>“What confidential talks?” bellowed St. Cyr thickly, growing red.</p>
   <p>“We need keep nothing from Watt, need we?” Martin went on imperturbably. “You hired me for prestige, and prestige you’ll get, if you can only keep your big mouth shut long enough. I’ll make the name of St. Cyr glorious for you. Naturally you may lose something at the box-office, but it’s well worth -”</p>
   <p>“Pjrzqxgl!” roared St. Cyr in his native tongue, and he lumbered up from the chair, brandishing the microphone in an enormous, hairy hand.</p>
   <p>Deftly Martin reached out and twitched it from his grasp.</p>
   <p>“Stop the film,” he ordered crisply.</p>
   <p>It was very strange. A distant part of his mind knew that normally he would never have dared behave this way, but he felt convinced that never before hi his life had he acted with complete normality. He glowed with a giddy warmth of confidence that everything he did would be right, at least while the twelve-hour treatment lasted…. ‘</p>
   <p>The screen flickered hesitantly, then went blank.</p>
   <p>“Turn the lights on,” Martin ordered the unseen presence beyond the mike. Softly and suddenly the room glowed with illumination. And upon the visages of Watt and St. Cyr he saw a mutual dawning uneasiness begin to break.</p>
   <p>He had just given them food for thought. But he had given them more than that. He tried to imagine what moved in the minds of the two men, below the suspicions he had just implanted. St. Cyr’s was fairly obvious. The Mixo-Lydian licked his lips-no mean task-and studied Martin with uneasy little, bloodshot eyes. Clearly Martin had acquired confidence from somewhere. What did it mean? What secret sin of St. Cyr’s had been discovered to him, what flaw hi his contract, that he dared behave so defiantly?</p>
   <p>Tolliver Watt was a horse of another color; apparently the man had no guilty secrets; but he too looked uneasy. Martin studied the proud face and probed for inner weaknesses. Watt would be a harder nut to crack. But Martin could do it.</p>
   <p>“That last underwater sequence,” he now said, pursuing his theme. “Pure trash, you know. It’ll have to come out. The whole scene must be shot from under water.”</p>
   <p>“Shut up!” Cyr shouted violently.</p>
   <p>“But it must, you know,” Martin went on. “Or it won’t jibe with the new stuff I’ve written in. In fact, I’m not at all certain that the whole picture shouldn’t be shot under water. You know, we could use the documentary technique -”</p>
   <p>“Raoul,” Watt said suddenly, “what’s this man trying to do?”</p>
   <p>“He is trying to break his contract, of course,” St. Cyr said, turning ruddy olive. “It is the bad phase all my writers go through before I get them whipped into shape. In Mixo-Lydia -”</p>
   <p>“Are you sure he’ll whip into shape?” Watt asked.</p>
   <p>“To me this is now a personal matter,” St. Cyr said, glaring at Martin. “I have spent nearly thirteen weeks on this man and I do not intend to waste my valuable tune on another. I tell you he is simply trying to break his contract-tricks, tricks, tricks.”</p>
   <p>“Are you?” Watt asked Martin coldly.</p>
   <p>“Not now,” Martin said. “I’ve changed my mind. My agent insists I’d be better off away from Summit. In fact, she has the curious feeling that I and Summit would suffer by a mesalliance. But for the first time I’m not sure I agree. I begin to see possibilities, even in the tripe St. Cyr has been stuffing down the public’s throat for years. Of course I can’t work miracles all at once. Audiences have come to expect garbage from Summit, and they’ve even been conditioned to like it. But we’ll begin hi a small way to re-educate them with this picture. I suggest we try to symbolize the Existentialist hopelessness of it by ending the film with a full four hundred feet of seascapes-nothing but vast, heaving stretches of ocean,” he ended, on a note of complacent satisfaction.</p>
   <p>A vast heaving stretch of Raoul St. Cyr rose from his chair and advanced upon Martin.</p>
   <p>“Outside, outside!” he shouted. “Back to your cell, you double-crossing vermin! I, Raoul St. Cyr, command it. Outside, before I rip you limb from limb -”</p>
   <p>Martin spoke quickly. His voice was calm, but he knew he would have to work fast.</p>
   <p>“You see, Watt?”|he said clearly, meeting Watt’s rather startled gaze. “Doesn’t dare let you exchange three words with me, for fear I’ll let something slip. No wonder he’s trying to put me out of here - he’s skating on thin ice these days.”</p>
   <p>Goaded, St. Cyr rolled forward in a ponderous lunge, but Watt interposed. It was true, of course, that the writer was probably trying to break his contract. But there were wheels within wheels here. Martin was too confident, too debonair. Something was going on which Watt did not understand.</p>
   <p>“All right, Raoul,” he said decisively. “Relax for a minute. I said relax! We don’t want Nick here suing you for assault and battery, do we? Your artistic temperament carries you away sometimes. Relax and let’s hear what Nick has to say.”</p>
   <p>“Watch out for him, Tolh’ver!” St. Cyr cried warningly. “They’re cunning, these creatures. Cunning as rats. You never know-”</p>
   <p>Martin raised the microphone with a lordly gesture. Ignoring the director, he said commandingly into the mike, “Put me through to the commissary. The bar, please. Yes. I want to order a drink. Something very special. A-ah-a Helena Glinska -”</p>
   <p>“Hello,” Erika Ashby’s voice said from the door. “Nick, are you there? May I come in?”</p>
   <p>The sound of her voice sent delicious chills rushing up and down Martin’s spine. He swung round, mike in hand, to welcome her. But St. Cyr, pleased at this diversion, roared before he could speak.</p>
   <p>“No, no, no, no! Go! Go at once. Whoever you are-out!”</p>
   <p>Erika, looking very brisk, attractive and firm, marched into the room and cast at Martha a look of resigned patience.</p>
   <p>Very clearly she expected to fight both her own battles and his.</p>
   <p>“I’m on business here,” she told St. Cyr coldly. “You can’t part author and agent like this. Nick and I want to have a word with Mr. Watt.”</p>
   <p>“Ah, my pretty creature, sit down,” Martin said in a loud, clear voice, scrambling out of his chair. “Welcome! I’m just ordering myself a drink. Will you have something?”</p>
   <p>Erika look at him with startled suspicion. “No, and neither will you,” she said. “How many have you had already? Nick, if you’re drunk at a time like this-”</p>
   <p>“And no shilly-shallying,” Martin said blandly into the mike. “I want it at once, do you hear? A Helena Glinska, yes. Perhaps you don’t know it? Then listen carefully. Take the largest Napoleon you’ve got. If you haven’t a big one, a small punch bowl will do. Fill it half full with ice-cold ale. Got that? Add three jiggers of creme de menthe -” ”’</p>
   <p>“Nick, are you mad?” Erika demanded, revolted.</p>
   <p>“-and six jiggers of honey,” Martin went on placidly. “Stir, don’t shake. Never shake a Helena Glinska. Keep it well chilled, and -”</p>
   <p>“Miss Ashby, we are very busy,” St. Cyr broke in importantly, making shooing motions toward the door. “Not now. Sorry. You interrupt. Go at once.”</p>
   <p>“-better add six more jiggers of honey,” Martin was heard to add contemplatively into the mike. “And then send it over immediately. Drop everything else, and get it here within sixty seconds. There’s a bonus for you if you do. Okay? Good. See to it.”</p>
   <p>He tossed the microphone casually at St. Cyr.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, Erika had closed in on Tolliver Watt.</p>
   <p>“I’ve just come from talking to Gloria Eden,” she said, “and she’s willing to do a one-picture deal with Summit if I okay it. But I’m not going to okay it unless you release Nick Martin from his contract, and that’s flat.”</p>
   <p>Watt showed pleased surprise.</p>
   <p>“Well, we might get together on that,” he said instantly, for he was a fan of Miss Eden’s and for a long tune had yearned to star her in a remake of Vanity Fair. “Why didn’t you bring her along? We could have -”</p>
   <p>“Nonsense!” St. Cyr shouted. “Do not discuss this matter yet, Tolliver.”</p>
   <p>“She’s down at Laguna,” Erika explained. “Be quiet, St. Cyr! I won’t -”</p>
   <p>A knock at the door interrupted her. Martin hurried to open it and as he had expected encountered a waiter with a tray.</p>
   <p>“Quick work,” he said urbanely, accepting the huge, coldly sweating Napoleon in a bank of ice. “Beautiful, isn’t it?”</p>
   <p>St. Cyr’s booming shouts from behind him drowned out whatever remark .the waiter may have made as he received a bill iron! Martin and withdrew, looking nauseated.</p>
   <p>“No, no, no, no,” St. Cyr was roaring. “Tolliver, we can get Gloria and keep this writer too, not that he is any good, but I have spent already thirteen weeks training him in the St. Cyr approach. Leave it to me. In Mixo-Lydia we handle -”</p>
   <p>Erika’s attractive mouth was opening and shuting, her voice unheard in the uproar. St. Cyr could keep it up indefinitely, as was well known in Hollywood. Martin sighed, lifted the brimming Napoleon and sniffed delicately as he stepped backward toward his chair. When his heel touched it, he tripped with the utmost grace and savoir-faire, and very deftly emptied the Helena Glinska, ale, honey, creme de menthe, ice and all, over St. Cyr’s capacious front.</p>
   <p>St. Cyr’s bellow broke the microphone.</p>
   <p>Martin had composed his invention carefully. The nauseous brew combined the maximum elements of wetness, coldness, stickiness and pungency.</p>
   <p>The drenched St. Cyr, shuddering violently as the icy beverage deluged his legs, snatched out his handkerchief and mopped in vain. The handkerchief merely stuck to his trousers, glued there by twelve jiggers of honey. He reeked of peppermint.</p>
   <p>“I suggest we adjourn to the commissary,” Martin said fastidiously. “In some private booth we can go on with this discussion away from the - the rather overpowering smell of peppermint.”</p>
   <p>“In Mixo-Lydia,” St. Cyr gasped, sloshing in his shoes as he turned toward Martin, “in Mixo-Lydia we throw to the dogs - we boil in oil - we -”</p>
   <p>“And next time,” Martin said, “please don’t joggle my elbow when I’m holding a Helena Glinska. It’s most annoying.”</p>
   <p>St. Cyr drew a mighty breath, rose to his full height - and then subsided. St. Cyr at the moment looked like a Keystone Kop after the chase sequence, and knew it.</p>
   <p>Even if he killed Martin now, the element of classic tragedy would be lacking. He would appear in the untenable position of Hamlet murdering his uncle with custard pies.</p>
   <p>“Do nothing until I return!” he commanded, and with a final glare at Martin plunged moistly out of the theater.</p>
   <p>The door crashed shut behind him. There was silence for a moment except for the soft music from the overhead screen which DeeDee had caused to be turned on again, so that she might watch her own lovely form flicker in dimmed images through pastel waves, while she sang a duet with Dan Dailey about sailors, mermaids and her home in far Atlantis.</p>
   <p>“And now,” said Martin, turning with quiet authority to Watt, who was regarding him with a baffled expression, “I want a word with you.”</p>
   <p>“I can’t discuss your contract till Raoul gets back,” Watt said quickly.</p>
   <p>“Nonsense,” Martin said in a firm voice. “Why should St. Cyr dictate your decisions? Without you, he couldn’t turn out a box-office success if he had to. No, be quiet, Erika. I’m handling this, my pretty creature.”</p>
   <p>Watt rose to his feet. “Sorry, I can’t discuss it,” he said. “St. Cyr pictures make money, and you’re an inexperien -”</p>
   <p>“That’s why I see the true situation so clearly,” Martin said. “The trouble with you is you draw a line between artistic genius and financial genius. To you, it’s merely routine when you work with the plastic medium of human minds, shaping them into an Ideal Audience. You are an ecological genius, Tolliver Watt! The true artist controls his environment, and gradually you, with a master’s consummate skill, shape that great mass of living, breathing humanity into a perfect audience… .”</p>
   <p>“Sorry,” Watt said, but not brusquely. “I really have no time - ah -”</p>
   <p>“Your genius has gone long enough unrecognized,” Martin said hastily, letting admiration ring in his golden voice. “You assume that St. Cyr is your equal. You give him your own credit titles. Yet in your own mind you must have known that half the credit for his pictures is yours. Was Phidias non-commercial? Was Michaelangelo? Commercialism is simply a label for functionalism, and all great artists produce functional art. The trivial details of Rubens’ masterpieces were filled in by assistants, were they not? But Rubens got the credit, not his hirelings. The proof of the pudding’s obvious. Why?” Cunningly gauging his listener, Martin here broke off.</p>
   <p>“Why?” Watt asked.</p>
   <p>“Sit down,” Martin urged. “I’ll tell you why. St. Cyr’s pictures make money, but you’re responsible for their molding into the ideal form, impressing your character-matrix upon everything and everyone at Summit Studios….”</p>
   <p>Slowly Watt sank into his chair. About his ears the hypnotic bursts of Disraelian rodomontade thundered compellingly. For Martin had the man hooked. With unerring aim he had at the first try discovered Watt’s weakness - the uncomfortable feeling in a professionally arty town that money-making is a basically contemptible business. Disraeli had handled tougher problems in his day. He had swayed parliaments.</p>
   <p>Watt swayed, tottered - and fell. It took about ten minutes, all in all. By the end of that tune, dizzy with eloquent praise of his economic ability Watt had realized that while St. Cyr might be an artistic genius, he had no business interfering in the plans of an economic genius. Nobody told Watt what to do when economics were concerned.</p>
   <p>“You have the broad vision that can balance all possibilities and show the right path with perfect clarity,” Martin said glibly. “Very well. You wish Eden. You feel - do you not? - that I am unsuitable material. Only geniuses can change their plans with instantaneous speed… . When will my contract release be ready?”</p>
   <p>“What?” said Watt, in a swimming, glorious daze. “Oh. Of course. Hm-m. Your contract release. Well, now -”</p>
   <p>“St. Cyr would stubbornly cling to past errors until Summit goes broke,” Martin pointed out. “Only a genius like Tolliver Watt strikes when the iron is hot, when he sees a chance to exchange failure for success, a Martin for an Eden.”</p>
   <p>“Hm-m,” Watt said. “Yes. Very well, then.” His long face grew shrewd. “Very well, you get your release - after I’ve signed Eden.”</p>
   <p>“There you put your finger on the heart of the matter,” Martin approved, after a very brief moment of somewhat dashed thought. “Miss Eden is still undecided. If you left the transaction to somebody like St. Cyr, say, it would be botched. Erika, you have your car here? How quickly could you drive Tolliver Watt to Laguna? He’s the only person with the skill to handle this situation.”</p>
   <p>“What situa - oh, yes. Of course, Nick. We could start right away.”</p>
   <p>“But -” Watt said.</p>
   <p>The Disraeli-matrix swept on into oratorical periods that made the walls ring. The golden tongue played arpeggios with logic.</p>
   <p>“I see,” the dazed Watt murmured, allowing himself to be shepherded toward the door. “Yes, yes, of course. Then - suppose you drop over to my place tonight, Martin. After I get the Eden signature, I’ll have your release prepared. Hm-m. Functional genius… .” His voice fell to a low, crooning mutter, and he moved quietly out of the door.</p>
   <p>Martin laid a hand on Erika’s arm as she followed him.</p>
   <p>“Wait a second,” he said. “Keep him away from the studio until we get the release. St. Cyr can still outshout me any time. But he’s hooked. We -”</p>
   <p>“Nick,” Erika said, looking searchingly into his face. “What’s happened?”</p>
   <p>“Tell you tonight,” Martin said hastily, hearing a distant bellow that might be the voice of St. Cyr approaching. “When I have tune I’m going to sweep you off your feet. Did you know that I’ve worshipped you from afar all my life? But right now, get Watt out of the way. Hurry!”</p>
   <p>Erika cast a glance of amazed bewilderment at him as he thrust her out of the door. Martin thought there was a certain element of pleasure in the surprise.</p>
   <p>“Where is Tolliver?” The loud, annoyed roar of St. Cyr made Martin wince. The director was displeased, it appeared, because only in Costumes could a pair of trousers be found large enough to fit him. He took it as a personal affront. “What have you done with Tolliver?” he bellowed.</p>
   <p>“Louder, please,” Martin said insolently. “I can’t hear you.”</p>
   <p>“DeeDee,” St. Cyr shouted, whirling toward the lovely star, who hadn’t stirred from her rapturous admiration of DeeDee in technicolor overhead. “Where is Tolliver?” Martin started. He had quite forgotten DeeDee.</p>
   <p>“You don’t know, do you DeeDee?” he prompted quickly.</p>
   <p>“Shut up,” St. Cyr snapped. “Answer me, you -” He added a brisk polysyllable in Mixo-Lydian, with the desired effect. DeeDee wrinkled her flawless brow.</p>
   <p>“Tolliver went away, I think. I’ve got it mixed up with the picture. He went home to meet Nick Martin, didn’t he?”</p>
   <p>“See?” Martin interrupted, relieved. “No use expecting DeeDee to -”</p>
   <p>“But Martin is here!” St. Cyr shouted. “Think, think!”</p>
   <p>“Was the contract release in the rushes?” DeeDee asked vaguely.</p>
   <p>“A contract release?” St. Cyr roared. “What is this? Never will I permit it, never, never, never! DeeDee, answer me where has Watt gone?”</p>
   <p>“He went somewhere with that agent,” DeeDee said. “Or was that in the rushes too?”</p>
   <p>“But where, where, where?”</p>
   <p>“They went to Atlantis,” DeeDee announced with an air of faint triumph.</p>
   <p>“No!” shouted St. Cyr. “That was the picture! The mermaid came from Atlantis, not Watt!”</p>
   <p>“Tolliver didn’t say he was coming from Atlantis,” DeeDee murmured, unruffled. “He said he was going to Atlantis. Then he was going to meet Nick Martin at his house tonight and give him his contract release.”</p>
   <p>“When?” St. Cyr demanded furiously. “Think, Dee-Dee? What time did -”</p>
   <p>“DeeDee,” Martin said, stepping forward with suave confidence, “you can’t remember a thing, can you?” But DeeDee was too subnormal to react even to a Disraeli-matrix. She merely smiled placidly at him.</p>
   <p>“Out of my way, you writer!” roared St. Cyr, advancing upon Martin. “You will get no contract release! You do not waste St. Cyr’s time and get away with it! This I will not endure. I fix you as I fixed Ed Cassidy!”</p>
   <p>Martin drew himself up and froze St. Cyr with an insolent smile. His hand toyed with an imaginary monocle. Golden periods were hanging at the end of his tongue. There only remained to hypnotize St. Cyr as he had hypnotized Watt. He drew a deep breath to unleash the floods of his eloquence - And St. Cyr, also too subhuman to be impressed by urbanity, hit Martin a clout on the jaw.</p>
   <p>It could never have happened in the British Parliament</p>
   <p>When the robot walked into Martin’s office that evening, he, or it went directly to the desk, unscrewed the bulb from the lamp, pressed the switch, and stuck his finger into the socket. There was a crackling flash. ENIAC withdrew his finger and shook his metallic head violently.</p>
   <p>“I needed that,” he sighed. “I’ve been on the go all day, by the Kaldekooz time-scale. Paleolithic, Neolithic, Technological - I don’t even know what time it is. Well, how’s your ecological adjustment getting on?”</p>
   <p>Martin rubbed Ms chin thoughtfully.</p>
   <p>“Badly,” he said. “Tell me, did Disraeli, as Prune Minister, ever have any dealings with a country called Mixo-Lydia?”</p>
   <p>“I have no idea,” said,the robot. “Why do you ask?”</p>
   <p>“Because my environment hauled back and took a poke at my jaw,” Martin said shortly.</p>
   <p>“Then you provoked it,” ENIAC countered. “A crisis - a situation of stress - always brings a man’s dominant trait to the fore, and Disraeli was dominantly courageous. Under stress, his courage became insolence. But he was intelligent enough to arrange his environment so insolence would be countered on the semantic level. Mixo-Lydia, eh? I place it vaguely, some billions of years ago, when it was inhabited by giant white apes. Or-oh, now I remember. It’s an encysted medieval survival, isn’t it?”</p>
   <p>Martin nodded.</p>
   <p>“So is this movie studio,” the robot said. “Your trouble is that you’ve run up against somebody who’s got a better optimum ecological adjustment than you have. That’s it. This studio environment is just emerging from medievalism, so it can easily slip back into that plenum when an optimum medievalist exerts pressure. Such types caused the Dark Ages. Well, you’d better change your environment to a neo-technological one, where the Disraeli-matrix can be successfully pro-survival. In your era, only a few archaic social-encystments like this studio are feudalistic, so go somewhere else. It takes a feudalist to match a feudalist.”</p>
   <p>“But I can’t go somewhere else,” Martin complained. “Not without my contract release. I was supposed to pick it up tonight, but St. Cyr found out what was happening, and he’ll throw a monkey-wrench in the works if he has to knock me out again to do it. I’m due at Watt’s place now, but St. Cyr’s already there -”</p>
   <p>“Spare me the trivia,” the robot said, raising his hand. “As for this St. Cyr, if he’s a medieval character-type, obviously he’ll knuckle under only to a stronger man of his own kind.”</p>
   <p>“How would Disraeli have handled this?” Martin demanded.</p>
   <p>“Disraeli would never have got into such a situation in the first place,” the robot said unhelpfully. “The ecologizer can give you the ideal ecological differential, but only for your own type, because otherwise it wouldn’t be your optimum. Disraeli would have been a failure in Russia in Ivan’s time.”</p>
   <p>“Would you mind clarifying that?” Martin asked thoughtfully.</p>
   <p>“Certainly,” the robot said with great rapidity. “It all depends on the threshold-response-time of the memory-circuits in the brain, if you assume the identity of the basic chromosome-pattern. The strength of neuronic activation varies in inverse proportion to the quantitative memory factor. Only actual experience could give you Disraeli’s memories, but your reactivity-thresholds have been altered until perception and emotional-indices approximate the Disraeli ratio.”</p>
   <p>“Oh,” Martin said. “But how would you, say, assert yourself against a medieval steam-shovel?”</p>
   <p>“By plugging my demountable brain into a larger steam-shovel,” ENIAC told him.</p>
   <p>Martin seemed pensive. His hand rose, adjusting an invisible monocle, while a look of perceptive imagination suddenly crossed his face.</p>
   <p>“You mentioned Russia in Ivan’s time,” he said. “Which Ivan would that be? Not, by any chance -?”</p>
   <p>“Ivan the Fourth. Very well adjusted to his environment he was, too. However, enough of this chit-chat. Obviously you’ll be one of the failures in our experiment, but our aim is to strike an average, so if you’ll put the ecologizer on your -”</p>
   <p>“That was Ivan the Terrible, wasn’t it?” Martin interrupted. “Look here, could you impress the character-matrix of Ivan the Terrible on my brain?”</p>
   <p>“That wouldn’t help you a bit,” the robot said. “Besides, it’s not the purpose of the experiment. Now -”</p>
   <p>“One moment. Disraeli can’t cope with a medievalist like St. Cyr on his own level, but if I had Ivan the Terrible’s reactive thresholds, I’ll bet I could throw a bluff that might do the trick. Even though St. Cyr’s bigger than I am, he’s got a veneer of civilization … now wait. He trades on that. He’s always dealt with people who are too civilized to use his own methods. The trick would be to call his bluff. And Ivan’s the man who could do it.”</p>
   <p>“But you don’t understand.”</p>
   <p>“Didn’t everybody in Russia tremble with fear at Ivan’s name?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, in -”</p>
   <p>“Very well, then,” Martin said triumphantly. “You’re going to impress the character-matrix of Ivan the Terrible on my mind, and then I’m going to put the bite on St. Cyr the way Ivan would have done it. Disraeli’s simply too civilized. Size is a factor, but character’s more important. I don’t look like Disraeli, but people have been reacting to me as though I were George Arliss down to the spit-curl. A good big man can always lick a good little man. But St. Cyr’s never been up against ft really uncivilized little man-one who’d gladly rip out an enemy’s heart with his bare hands.” Martin nodded briskly. “St. Cyr will back down-I’ve found that out. But it would take somebody like Ivan to make him stay all the way down.”</p>
   <p>“If you think I’m going to impress Ivan’s matrix on you, you’re wrong,” the robot said.</p>
   <p>“You couldn’t be talked into it?”</p>
   <p>“I,” said ENIAC, “am a robot, semantically adjusted. Of course you couldn’t talk me into it.”</p>
   <p>Perhaps not, Martin reflected, but Disraeli-hm-m. “Man is a machine.” Why, Disraeli was the one person in the world ideally fitted for robot-coercion. To him, men were machines - and what was ENIAC?</p>
   <p>“Let’s talk this over-” Martin began, absently pushing the desk-lamp toward the robot. And then the golden tongue that had swayed empires was loosed… .</p>
   <p>“You’re not going to like this,” the robot said dazedly, sometime later. “Ivan won’t do at … oh, you’ve got me all confused. You’ll have to eyeprint a -” He began to pull out of his sack the helmet and the quarter-mile of red ribbon.</p>
   <p>“To tie up my bonny gray brain,” Martin said, drunk with his own rhetoric. “Put it on my head. That’s right. Ivan the Terrible, remember. I’ll fix St. Cyr’s Mixo-Lydian wagon.”</p>
   <p>“Differential depends on environment as much as on heredity,” the robot muttered, clapping the helmet on Martin’s head. “Though naturally Ivan wouldn’t have had the Tsardom environment without his particular heredity, involving Helena Glinska — there!” He removed the helmet.</p>
   <p>“But nothing’s happening,” Martin said. “I don’t feel any different.”</p>
   <p>“It’ll take a few moments. This isn’t your basic character-pattern, remember, as Disraeli’s was. Enjoy yourself while you can. You’ll get the Ivan-effect soon enough.” He shouldered the sack and headed uncertainly for the door.</p>
   <p>“Wait,” Martin said uneasily. “Are you sure -”</p>
   <p>“Be quiet. I forgot something - some formality - now I’m all confused. Well, I’ll think of it later, or earlier, as the case may be. I’ll see you in twelve hours - I hope.”</p>
   <p>The robot departed. Martin shook his head tentatively from side to side. Then he got up and followed ENIAC to the door. But there was no sign of the robot, except for a diminishing whirlwind of dust in the middle of the corridor.</p>
   <p>Something began to happen in Martin’s brain. …</p>
   <p>Behind him, the telephone rang.</p>
   <p>Martin heard himself gasp with pure terror. With a sudden, impossible, terrifying, absolute certainty he knew who was telephoning.</p>
   <p>Assassins!</p>
   <p>“Yes, Mr. Martin,” said Tolliver Watt’s butler to the telephone. “Miss Ashby is here. She is with Mr. Watt and Mr. St. Cyr at the moment, but I will give her your message. You are detained. And she is to call for you - where?”</p>
   <p>“The broom-closet on the second floor of the Writers’ Building,” Martin said in a quavering voice. “It’s the only one near a telephone with a long enough cord so I could take the phone in here with me. But I’m not at all certain that I’m safe. I don’t like the looks of that broom on my left.”</p>
   <p>“Sir?”</p>
   <p>“Are you sure you’re Tolliver Watt’s butler?” Martin demanded nervously.</p>
   <p>“Quite sure, Mr.-eh-Mr. Martin.”</p>
   <p>“I am Mr. Martin,” cried Martin with terrified defiance. “By all the laws of God and man, Mr. Marthin I am and Mr. Martin I will remain, in spite of all attempts by rebellious dogs to depose me from my rightful place.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, sir. The broom-closet you say, sir?”</p>
   <p>“The broom-closet. Immediately. But swear not to tell another soul, no matter how much you’re threatened. I'll protect you.”</p>
   <p>“Very well, sir. Is that all?”</p>
   <p>“Yes. Tell Miss Ashby to hurry. Hang up now. The line may be tapped. I have enemies.”</p>
   <p>There was a click. Martin replaced his own receiver and furtively surveyed the broom-closet. He told himself that this was ridiculous. There was nothing to be afraid of, was there? True, the broom-closet’s narrow walls were closing in upon him alarmingly, while the ceiling descended….</p>
   <p>Panic-stricken, Martin emerged from the closet, took a long breath, and throw back his shoulders. “N-not a thing to be afraid of,” he said. “Who’s afraid?” Whistling, he began to stroll down the hall toward the staircase, but midway agoraphobia overcame him, and his nerve broke.</p>
   <p>He ducked into his own office and sweated quietly in the dark until he had mustered up enough courage to turn on a lamp.</p>
   <p>The Encyclopaedia Britannica, in its glass-fronted cabinet, caught his eye. With noiseless haste, Martin secured ITALY to LORD and opened the volume at his desk. Something, obviously, was very, very wrong. The robot had said that Martin wasn’t going to like being Ivan the Terrible, come to think of it. But was Martin wearing Ivan’s character-matrix? Perhaps he’d got somebody else’s matrix by mistake-that of some arrant coward. Or maybe the Mad Tsar of Russia had really been called Ivan the Terrified. Martin flipped the rustling pages nervously. Ivan, Ivan-here it was.</p>
   <p>Son of Helena Glinska … married Anastasia Zakharina-Koshkina … private life unspeakably abominable … memory astonishing, energy indefatigable, ungovernable fury-great natural ability, political foresight, anticipated the ideals of Peter the Great - Martin shook his head.</p>
   <p>Then he caught his breath at the next line.</p>
   <p>Ivan had lived in an atmosphere of apprehension, imagining that every man’s hand was against him.</p>
   <p>“Just like me,” Martin murmured. “But - but there was more to Ivan than just cowardice. I don’t understand.”</p>
   <p>“Differential,” the robot had said, “depends on environment as much as on heredity. Though naturally Ivan wouldn’t have had the Tsardom environment without his particular heredity.”</p>
   <p>Martin sucked in his breath sharply. Environment does make a difference. No doubt Ivan IV had been a fearful coward, but heredity plus environment had given Ivan the one great weapon that had enabled him to keep his cowardice a recessive trait.</p>
   <p>Ivan the Terrible had been Tsar of all the Russia.</p>
   <p>Give a coward a gun, and, while he doesn’t stop being a coward, it won’t show in the same way. He may act like a violent, aggressive tyrant instead. That, of course, was why Ivan had been ecologically successful - in his specialized environment. He’d never run up against many stresses that brought his dominant trait to the fore. Like Disraeli, he had been able to control his environment so that such stresses were practically eliminated.</p>
   <p>Martin turned green.</p>
   <p>Then he remembered Erika. Could he get Erika to keep St. Cyr busy, somehow, while he got his contract release from Watt? As long as he could avoid crises, he could keep his nerve from crumbling, but-there were assassins everywhere!</p>
   <p>Erika was on her way to the lot by now. Martin swallowed.</p>
   <p>He would meet her outside the studio. The broom-closet wasn’t safe. He could be trapped there like a rat -</p>
   <p>“Nonsense,” Martin told himself with shivering firmness. “This isn’t me. All I have to do is get a g-grip on m-myself. Come, now. Buck up. Toujours I’audace!”</p>
   <p>But he went out of his office and downstairs very softly and cautiously. After all, one never knew. And when every man’s hand was against one….</p>
   <p>Quaking, the character-matrix of Ivan the Terrible stole toward a studio gate.</p>
   <p>The taxi drove rapidly toward Bel-Air.</p>
   <p>“But what were you doing up that tree?” Erika demanded.</p>
   <p>Martin shook violently.</p>
   <p>“A werewolf,” he chattered. “And a vampire and a ghoul and - I saw them, I tell you. There I was at the studio gate, and they all came at me in a mob.”</p>
   <p>“But they were just coming back from dinner,” Erika said. “You know Summit’s doing night shooting on Abbott and Costello Meet Everybody. Karloff wouldn’t hurt a fly.”</p>
   <p>“I kept telling myself that,” Martin said dully, “but was out of my mind with guilt and fear. You see, I’m an abominable monster. But it’s not my fault. It’s environmental. I grew up in brutal and degrading conditions - oh, look!” He pointed toward a traffic cop ahead. “The police! Traitors even in the palace guards!”</p>
   <p>“Lady, is that guy nuts?” the cabbie demanded.</p>
   <p>“Mad or sane, I am Nicholas Martin,” Martin announced, with an abrupt volte face. He tried to stand up commandingly, bumped his head, screamed “Assassins!”’ and burrowed into a corner of the seat, panting horribly.</p>
   <p>Erika gave him a thoughtful, worried look.</p>
   <p>“Nick,” she said, “how much have you had to drink? What’s wrong?”</p>
   <p>Martin shut his eyes and lay back against the cushions.</p>
   <p>“Let me have a few minutes, Erika,” he pleaded. “I’ll be all right as soon as I recover from stress. It’s only when I’m under stress that Ivan -”</p>
   <p>“You can accept your contract release from Watt, can’t you? Surely you’ll be able to manage that.”</p>
   <p>“Of course,” Martin said with feeble bravery. He thought it over and reconsidered. “If I can hold your hand,” he suggested, taking no chances.</p>
   <p>This disgusted Erika so much that for two miles there was no more conversation within the cab.</p>
   <p>Erika had been thinking her own thoughts.</p>
   <p>“You’ve certainly changed since this morning,” she observed. “Threatening to make love to me, of all things. As if I’d stand for it. I’d like to see you try.” There was a pause. Erika slid her eyes sidewise toward Martin. “I said I’d like to see you try,” she repeated.</p>
   <p>“Oh, you would, would you?” Martin said with hollow valor. He paused. Oddly enough his tongue, hitherto frozen stiff on one particular subject in Erika’s presence, was now thoroughly loosened. Martin wasted no time on theory. Seizing his chance before a new stress might unexpectedly arise, he instantly poured out his heart to Erika, who visibly softened.</p>
   <p>“But why didn’t you ever say so before?” she asked.</p>
   <p>“I can’t imagine,” Martin said. “Then you’ll marry me?”</p>
   <p>“But why were you acting so -”</p>
   <p>“Will you marry me?”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Erika said, and there was a pause. Martin moistened his lips, discovering that somehow he and Erika had moved close together. He was about to seal the bargain in the customary manner when a sudden thought struck him and made him draw back with a little start.</p>
   <p>Erika opened her eyes.</p>
   <p>“Ah -” said Martin. “Um. I just happened to remember. There’s a bad fib epidemic in Chicago. Epidemics spread like wildfire, you know. Why, it could be in Hollywood by now - especially with the prevailing westerly winds.”</p>
   <p>“I’m damned if I’m going to be proposed to and not kissed,” Erika said in a somewhat irritated tone. “You kiss me!”</p>
   <p>“But I might give you bubonic plague,” Martin said nervously. “Kissing spreads germs. It’s a well-known fact.”</p>
   <p>“Nick!”</p>
   <p>“Well - I don’t know - when did you last have a cold?”</p>
   <p>Erika pulled away from him and went to sit in the, other corner.</p>
   <p>“Ah,” Martin said, after a long silence. “Erika?”</p>
   <p>“Don’t talk to me, you miserable man,” Erika said. “You monster, you.”</p>
   <p>“I can’t help it,” Martin cried wildly. “I’ll be a coward for twelve hours. It’s not my fault. After eight tomorrow morning I’ll - I’ll walk into a lion-cage if you want, but tonight I’m as yellow as Ivan the Terrible! At least let me tell you what’s been happening.”</p>
   <p>Erika said nothing. Martin instantly plunged into his long and improbable tale.</p>
   <p>“I don’t believe a word of it,” Erika said, when he had finished. She shook her head sharply. “Just the same, I’m still your agent, and your career’s still my responsibility. The first and only thing we have to do is get your contract release from Tolliver Watt. And that’s all we’re going to consider right now, do you hear?”</p>
   <p>“But St. Cyr -”</p>
   <p>“I’ll do all the talking. You won’t have to say a word. If St. Cyr tries to bully you, I’ll handle him. But you’ve got to be there with me, or St. Cyr will make that an excuse to postpone things again. I know him.”</p>
   <p>“Now I’m under stress again,” Martin said wildly. “I can’t stand it. I’m not the Tsar of Russia.”</p>
   <p>“Lady,” said the cab-driver, looking back, “if I was you, I’d sure as hell break off that engagement.” </p>
   <p>“Heads will roll for this,” Martin said ominously.</p>
   <p>“By mutual consent, agree to terminate … yes,” Watt said, affixing his name to the legal paper that lay before him on the desk. “That does it. But where in the world is that fellow Martin? He came in with you, I’m certain.”</p>
   <p>“Did he?” Erika asked, rather wildly. She too, was wondering how Martin had managed to vanish so miraculously from her side. Perhaps he had crept with lightning rapidity under the carpet. She forced her mind from the thought and reached for the contract release Watt was folding.</p>
   <p>“Wait,” St. Cyr said, his lower lip jutting. “What about a clause giving us an option on Martin’s next play?”</p>
   <p>Watt paused, and the director instantly struck home.</p>
   <p>“Whatever it may be, I can turn it into a vehicle for DeeDee, eh, DeeDee?” He lifted a sausage finger at the lovely star, who nodded obediently.</p>
   <p>“It’s going to have an all-male cast,” Erika said hastily. “And we’re discussing contract releases, not options.”</p>
   <p>“He would give me an option if I had him here,” St. Cyr growled, torturing his cigar horribly. “Why does everything conspire against an artist?” He waved a vast, hairy fist in the air. “Now I must break in a new writer, which is a great waste. Within a fortnight Martin would have been a St. Cyr writer. In fact, it is still possible.”</p>
   <p>“I’m afraid not, Raoul,” Watt said resignedly. “You really shouldn’t have hit Martin at the studio today.”</p>
   <p>“But - but he would not dare charge me with assault. In Mixo-Lydia -”</p>
   <p>“Why, hello, Nick,” DeeDee said, with a bright smile. “What are you hiding behind those curtains for?”</p>
   <p>Every eye was turned toward the window draperies, just in time to see the white, terrified face of Nicholas Martin flip out of sight like a scared chipmunk’s. Erika, her heart dropping, said hastily, “Oh, that isn’t Nick. It doesn’t look a bit like him. You make a mistake, Dee-Dee.”</p>
   <p>“Did I?” DeeDee asked, perfectly willing to agree.</p>
   <p>“Certainly,” Erika said, reaching for the contract release in Watt’s hand. “Now if you’ll just let me have this, I’ll -”</p>
   <p>“Stop!” cried St. Cyr in a bull’s bellow. Head sunk between his heavy shoulders, he lumbered to the window and jerked the curtains aside.</p>
   <p>“Ha!” the director said in a sinister voice. “Martin.”</p>
   <p>“It’s a lie,” Martin said feebly, making a desperate attempt to conceal his “stress-triggered panic. “I’ve abdicated.”</p>
   <p>St. Cyr, who had stepped back a pace, was studying Martin carefully. Slowly the cigar in his mouth began to tilt upwards. An unpleasant grin widened the director’s mouth.</p>
   <p>He shook a finger under Martin’s quivering nostrils.</p>
   <p>“You!” he said. “Tonight it is a different tune, eh? Today you were drunk. Now I see it all. Valorous with pots, like they say.”</p>
   <p>“Nonsense,” Martin said, rallying his courage by a glance at Erika. “Who say? Nobody but you would say a thing like that. Now what’s this all about?”</p>
   <p>“What were you doing behind that curtain?” Watt asked.</p>
   <p>“I wasn’t behind the curtain,” Martin said, with great bravado. “You were. All of you. I was in front of the curtain. Can I help it if the whole lot of you conceal yourselves behind curtains in a library, like - like conspirators?” The word was unfortunately chosen. A panicky light flashed into Martin’s eyes. “Yes, conspirators,” he went on nervously. “You think I don’t know, eh? Well, I do. You’re all assassins, plotting and planning. So this is your headquarters, is it? All night your hired dogs have been at my heels, driving me like a wounded caribou to -”</p>
   <p>“We’ve got to be going,” Erika said desperately. “There’s just time to catch the next carib - the next plane east.” She reached for the contract release, but Watt suddenly put it in his pocket. He turned his chair toward Martin.</p>
   <p>“Will you give us an option on your next play?” he demanded.</p>
   <p>“Of course he will give us an option!” St. Cyr said, studying Martin’s air of bravado with an experienced eye. “Also, there is to be no question of a charge of assault, for if there is I will beat you. So it is in Mixo-Lydia. In fact, you do not even want a release from your contract, Martin. It is all a mistake. I will turn you into a St. Cyr writer, and all will be well. So. Now you will ask Tolliver to tear up that release, will you not - ha?”</p>
   <p>“Of course you won’t, Nick,” Erika cried. “Say so!”</p>
   <p>There was a pregnant silence. Watt watched with sharp interest. So did the unhappy Erika, torn between her responsibility as Martin’s agent and her disgust at the man’s abject cowardice. DeeDee watched too, her eyes very wide and a cheerful smile upon her handsome face. But the battle was obviously between Martin and Raoul St. Cyr.</p>
   <p>Martin drew himself up desperately. Now or never he must force himself to be truly Terrible. Already he had a troubled expression, just like Ivan. He strove to look sinister too. An enigmatic smile played around his lips. For an instant he resembled the Mad Tsar of Russia, except, of course, that he was clean-shaven. With contemptuous, regal power Martin stared down the Mixo-Lydian. “</p>
   <p>“You will tear up that release and sign an agreement giving us option on your next play too, ha?” St. Cyr said - but a trifle uncertainly.</p>
   <p>“I’ll do as I please,” Martin told him. “How would you like to be eaten alive by dogs?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know, Raoul,” Watt said. “Let’s try to get this settled even if -”</p>
   <p>“Do you want me to go over to Metro and take Dee-Dee with me?” St. Cyr cried, turning toward Watt. “He will sign!” And, reaching into an inner pocket for a pen, the burly director swung back toward Martin.</p>
   <p>“Assassin!” cried Martin, misinterpreting the gesture.</p>
   <p>A gloating smile appeared on St. Cyr’s revolting features.</p>
   <p>“Now we have him, Tolliver,” he said, with heavy triumph, and these ominous words added the final stress to Martin’s overwhelming burden. With a mad cry he rushed past St. Cyr, wrenched open a door, and fled.</p>
   <p>From behind him came Erika’s Valkyrie voice.</p>
   <p>“Leave him alone! Haven’t you done enough already? Now I’m going to get that contract release from you before I leave this room, Tolliver Watt, and I warn you, St. Cyr, if you -”</p>
   <p>But by then Martin was five rooms away, and the voice faded. He darted on, hopelessly trying to make himself slow down and return to the scene of battle. The pressure was too strong. Terror hurled him down a corridor, into another room, and against a metallic object from which he rebounded, to find himself sitting on the floor looking up at ENIAC Gamma the Ninety-Third.</p>
   <p>“Ah, there you are,” the robot said. “I’ve been searching all over space-time for you. You forgot to give me a waiver of responsibility when you talked me into varying the experiment. The Authorities would be in my gears if I didn’t bring back an eyeprinted waiver when a subject’s scratched by variance?"</p>
   <p>With a frightened glance behind him, Martin rose to his feet.</p>
   <p>“What?” he asked confusedly. “Listen, you’ve got to change me back to myself. Everyone’s trying to kill me. You’re just in time. I can’t wait twelve hours. Change me back to myself, quick!”</p>
   <p>“Oh, I’m through with you,” the robot said callously. “You’re no longer a suitably unconditioned subject, after that last treatment you insisted on. I should have got the waiver from you then, but you got me all confused with Disraeli’s oratory. Now here. Just hold this up to your left eye for twenty seconds.” He extended a flat, glittering little metal disk. “It’s already sensitized and filled out. It only needs your eyeprint. Affix it, and you’ll never see me again.”</p>
   <p>Martin shrank away.</p>
   <p>“But what’s going to happen to me?” he quavered, swallowing.</p>
   <p>“How should I know? After twelve hours, the treatment will wear off, and you’ll be yourself again. Hold this up to your eye, now.”</p>
   <p>“I will if you’ll change me back to myself,” Martin haggled.</p>
   <p>“I can’t. It’s against the rules. One variance is bad enough, even with a filed waiver, but two? Oh, no. Hold this up to your left eye -”</p>
   <p>“No,” Martin said with feeble firmness. “I won’t.”</p>
   <p>ENIAC studied him.</p>
   <p>“Yes, you will,” the robot said finally, “or I’ll go boo at you.”</p>
   <p>Martin paled slightly, but he shook his head in desperate determination.</p>
   <p>“No,” he said doggedly. “Unless I get rid of Ivan’s matrix right now, Erika will never marry me and I’ll never get my contract release from Watt. All you have to do is put that helmet on my head and change me back to myself. Is that too much to ask?”</p>
   <p>“Certainly, of a robot,” ENIAC said stiffly. “No more shilly-shallying. It’s lucky you are wearing the Ivan-matrix, so I can impose my will on you. Put your eyeprint on this. Instantly!”</p>
   <p>Martin rushed behind the couch and hid. The robot advanced menacingly. And at that moment, pushed to the last ditch, Martin suddenly remembered something.</p>
   <p>He faced the robot.</p>
   <p>“Wait,” he said. “You don’t understand. I can’t eyeprint that thing. It won’t work on me. Don’t you realize that? It’s supposed to take the eyeprint -”</p>
   <p>“—of the rod-and-cone pattern of the retina,” the robot said. “So-”</p>
   <p>“So how can it do that unless I can keep my eye open for twenty seconds? My perceptive reaction-thresholds are Ivan’s aren’t they? Ivan can't control the reflex of blinking. I’ve got a coward’s synapses. And they’d force me to shut my eyes tight the second that gimmick got too close to them.”</p>
   <p>“Hold them open,” the robot suggested. “With your fingers.”</p>
   <p>“My fingers have reflexes too,” Martin argued, moving toward a sideboard. “There’s only one answer. I’ve got to get drunk. If I’m half stupefied with liquor, my reflexes will be so slow I won’t be able to shut my eyes. And don’t try to use force, either. If I dropped dead with fear, how could you get my eyeprint then?”</p>
   <p>“Very easily,” the robot said. “I’d pry open your lids -”</p>
   <p>Martin hastily reached for a bottle on the sideboard, and a glass. But his hand swerved aside and gripped, instead, a siphon of soda water.</p>
   <p>“- only,” ENIAC went on, “the forgery might be detected.”</p>
   <p>Martin fizzled the glass full of soda and took a long drink.</p>
   <p>“I won’t be long getting drunk,” he said, his voice thickening. “In fact, it’s beginning to work already. See? I’m cooperating.”</p>
   <p>The robot hesitated.</p>
   <p>“Well, hurry up about it,” he said, and sat down.</p>
   <p>Martin, about to take another drink, suddenly paused, staring at ENIAC. Then, with a sharply indrawn breath, he lowered the glass.</p>
   <p>“What’s the matter now?” the robot asked. “Drink your - what is it?”</p>
   <p>“It’s whiskey,” Martin told the inexperienced automaton, “but now I see it all. You’ve put poison in it. So that’s your plan, is it? Well, I won’t touch another drop, and now you’ll never get my eyeprint. I’m no fool.”</p>
   <p>“Cog Almighty,” the robot said, rising. “You poured that drink yourself! How could I have poisoned it? Drink!”</p>
   <p>“I won’t,” Martin said, with a coward’s stubborness, fighting back the growing suspicion that the drink might really be toxic.</p>
   <p>“You swallow that drink,” ENIAC commanded, his voice beginning to quiver slightly. “It’s perfectly harmless.”</p>
   <p>“Then prove it!” Martin said cunningly. “Would you be willing to switch glasses? Would you drink this poisoned brew yourself?”</p>
   <p>“How do you expect me to drink?” the robot demanded. “I-” He paused. “All right, hand me the glass,” he said. “I’ll take a sip. Then you’ve got to drink the rest of it.”</p>
   <p>“Aha!” Martin said. “You betrayed yourself that time. You’re a robot. You can’t drink, remember? Not the same way that I can, anyhow. Now I’ve got you trapped, you assassin. There’s your brew.” He pointed to a floorlamp. “Do you dare to drink with me now, in your electrical fashion, or do you admit you are trying to poison me? Wait a minute, what am I saying? That wouldn’t prove a -”</p>
   <p>“Of course it would,” the robot said hastily. “You’re perfectly right, and it’s very cunning of you. We’ll drink together, and that will prove your whiskey’s harmless - so you’ll keep on drinking till your reflexes slow down, see?”</p>
   <p>“Well,” Martin began uncertainly, but the unscrupulous robot unscrewed a bulb from the floorlamp, pulled the switch, and inserted his finger into the empty socket, which caused a crackling flash. “There,” the robot said. “It isn’t poisoned, see?”</p>
   <p>“You’re not swallowing it,” Martin said suspiciously. “You’re holding it in your mouth - I mean your finger.”</p>
   <p>ENIAC again probed the socket.</p>
   <p>“Well, all right, perhaps,” Martin said, in a doubtful fashion. “But I’m not going to risk your slipping a powder in my liquor, you traitor. You’re going to keep up with me, drink for drink, until I can eyeprint that gimmick of yours - or else I stop drinking. But does sticking your finger in that lamp really prove my liquor isn’t poisoned? I can’t quite -”</p>
   <p>“Of course it does,” the robot said quickly. “I’ll prove it. I’ll do it again … f(t). Powerful DC, isn’t it? Certainly it proves it. Keep drinking, now.”</p>
   <p>His gaze watchfully on the robot, Martin lifted his glass of club soda.</p>
   <p>“F ff ff f(t)!” cried the robot, some time later, sketching a singularly loose smile on its metallic face.</p>
   <p>“Best fermented mammoth’s milk I ever tasted,” Martin agreed, lifting his tenth glass of soda-water. He felt slightly queasy and wondered if he might be drowning.</p>
   <p>“Mammoth’s milk?” asked ENIAC thickly. “What year is this?”</p>
   <p>Martin drew a long breath. Ivan’s capacious memory had served him very well so far. Voltage, he recalled, increased the frequency of the robot’s thought-patterns and disorganized ENIAC’s memory - which was being proved before his eyes. But the crux of his plan was yet to come… .</p>
   <p>“The year of the Great Hairy One, of course,” Martin said briskly. “Don’t you remember?”</p>
   <p>“Then you -” ENIAC strove to focus upon his drinking-companion. “You must be Mammoth-Slayer.”</p>
   <p>“That’s it!” Martin cried. “Have another jolt. What about giving me the treatment now?”</p>
   <p>“What treatment?”</p>
   <p>Martin looked impatient. “You said you were going to impose the character-matrix of Mammoth-Slayer on my mind. You said that would insure my optimum ecological adjustment in this temporal phase, and nothing else would.”</p>
   <p>“Did I? But you’re not Mammoth-Slayer,” ENIAC said confusedly. “Mammoth-Slayer was the son of the Great Hairy One. What’s your mother’s name?”</p>
   <p>“The Great Hairy One,” Martin replied, at which the robot grated its hand across its gleaming forehead.</p>
   <p>“Have one more jolt,” Martin suggested. “Now take out the ecologizer and put it on my head.”</p>
   <p>“Like this?” ENIAC asked, obeying. “I keep feeling I’ve forgotten something important. F (t).”</p>
   <p>Martin adjusted the crystal helmet on his skull. “Now,” he commanded. “Give me the character-matrix of Mammoth-Slayer, son of the Great Hairy One.”</p>
   <p>“Well-all right,” ENIAC said dizzily. The red ribbons swirled. There was a flash from the helmet. “There,” the robot said. “It’s done. It may take a few minutes to begin functioning, but then for twelve hours you’ll - wait! Where are you going?”</p>
   <p>But Martin had already departed.</p>
   <p>The robot stuffed the helmet and the quarter-mile of red ribbon back for the last tune. He lurched to the floorlamp, muttering something about one for the road. Afterward, the room lay empty. A fading murmur said, “F (t).”</p>
   <p>“Nick!” Erika gasped, staring at the figure in the doorway. “Don’t stand like that! You frighten me!”</p>
   <p>Everyone in the room looked up abruptly at her cry, and so were just in time to see a horrifying change take place hi Martin’s shape. It was an illusion, of course, but an alarming one. His knees slowly bent until he was half-crouching, his shoulders slumped as though bowed by the weight of enormous back and shoulder muscles, and his arms swung forward until their knuckles hung perilously near the floor.</p>
   <p>Nicholas Martin had at last achieved a personality whose ecological norm would put him on a level with Raoul St. Cyr.</p>
   <p>“Nick!” Erika quavered.</p>
   <p>Slowly Martin’s jaw protruded till his lower teeth were hideously visible. Gradually his eyelids dropped until he was peering up out of tiny, wicked sockets. Then, slowly, a perfectly shocking grin broadened Mr. Martin’s mouth.</p>
   <p>“Erika,” he said throatily. “Mine!”</p>
   <p>And with that, he shambled forward, seized the horrified girl in his arms, and bit her on the ear.</p>
   <p>“Oh, Nick,” Erika murmured, closing her eyes. “Why didn’t you ever - no, no, no! Nick! Stop it! The contract release. We’ve got to - Nick, what are you doing?” She snatched at Martin’s departing form, but too late.</p>
   <p>For all his ungainly and unpleasant gait, Martin covered ground fast. Almost instantly he was clambering over Watt’s desk as the most direct route to that startled tycoon. DeeDee looked on, a little surprised, St. Cyr lunged forward.</p>
   <p>“In Mixo-Lydia-” he began. “Ha! So!” He picked up Martin and threw him across the room.</p>
   <p>“Oh, you beast,” Erika cried, and flung herself upon the director, beating at his brawny chest. On second thought, she used her shoes on his shins with more effect. St. Cyr, no gentleman, turned her around, pinioned her arms behind her, and glanced up at Watt’s alarmed cry.</p>
   <p>“Martin! What are you doing?”</p>
   <p>There was reason for his inquiry. Apparently unhurt by St. Cyr’s toss, Martin had hit the floor, rolled over and over like-a ball, knocked down a floorlamp with a crash, and uncurled, with an unpleasant expression on his face. He rose crouching, bandy-legged, his arms swinging low, a snarl curling his lips.</p>
   <p>“You take my mate?” the pithecanthropic Mr. Martin inquired throatily, rapidly losing all touch with the twentieth century. It was a rhetorical question. He picked up the lamp-standard - he did not have to bend to do it - tore off the silk shade as he would have peeled foliage from a tree-limb, and balanced the weapon in his hand. Then he moved forward, carrying the lamp-standard like a spear.</p>
   <p>“I,” said Martin, “kill.”</p>
   <p>He then endeavored, with the most admirable single-heartedness, to carry out his expressed intention. The first thrust of the blunt, improvised spear rammed into St. Cyr’s solar plexus and drove him back against the wall with a booming thud. This seemed to be what Martin wanted. Keeping one end of his spear pressed into the director’s belly, he crouched lower, dug his toes into the rug, and did his very best to drill a hole in St. Cyr.</p>
   <p>“Stop it!” cried Watt, flinging himself into the conflict. Ancient reflexes took over. Martin’s arm shot out. Watt shot off in the opposite direction.</p>
   <p>The lamp broke.</p>
   <p>Martin looked pensively at the pieces, tentatively began to bite one, changed his mind, and looked at St. Cyr instead. The gasping director, mouthing threats, curses and objections, drew himself up, and shook a huge fist at Martin.</p>
   <p>“I,” he announced, “shall kill you with my bare hands. Then I go over to MGM with DeeDee. In Mixo-Lydia-”</p>
   <p>Martin lifted his own fists toward his face. He regarded them. He unclenched them slowly, while a terrible grin spread across his face. And then, with every tooth showing, and with the hungry gleam of a mad tiger in his tiny little eyes, he lifted his gaze to St. Cyr’s throat.</p>
   <p>Mammoth-Slayer was not the son of the Great Hairy One for nothing.</p>
   <p>Martin sprang.</p>
   <p>So did St. Cyr - in another direction, screaming with sudden terror. For, after all, he was only a medievalist. The feudal man is far more civilized than the so-called man of Mammoth-Slayer’s primordially direct era, and as a man recoils from a small but murderous wildcat, so St. Cyr fled in sudden civilized horror from an attacker who was, literally, afraid of nothing.</p>
   <p>He sprang through the window and, shrieking, vanished into the night.</p>
   <p>Martin was taken by surprise. When Mammoth-Slayer leaped at an enemy, the enemy leaped at him too, and so Martin’s head slammed against the wall with disconcerting force. Dimly he heard diminishing, terrified cries. Laboriously he crawled to his feet and sat back against the wall, snarling, quite ready….</p>
   <p>“Nick!” Erika’s voice called. “Nick, it’s me! Stop it! Stop it! DeeDee -”</p>
   <p>“Ugh?” Martin said thickly, shaking his head. “Kill.” He growled softly, blinking through red-rimmed little eyes at the scene around him. It swam back slowly into focus. Erika was struggling with DeeDee near the window.</p>
   <p>“You let me go,” DeeDee cried. “Where Raoul goes, I go.”</p>
   <p>“DeeDee!” pleaded a new voice. Martin glanced aside to see Tolliver Watt crumpled in a corner, a crushed lamp-shade half obscuring his face.</p>
   <p>With a violent effort Martin straightened up. Walking upright seemed unnatural, somehow, but it helped submerge Mammoth-Slayer’s worst instincts, Besides, with St. Cyr gone, stresses were slowly subsiding, so that Mammoth-Slayer’s dominant trait was receding from the active foreground.</p>
   <p>Martin tested his tongue cautiously, relieved to find he was still capable of human speech.</p>
   <p>“Uh,” he said. “Arrgh … ah. Watt.”</p>
   <p>Watt blinked at him anxiously through the lamp-shade.</p>
   <p>“Urgh … Ur-release,” Martin said, with a violent effort. “Contract release. Gimme.”</p>
   <p>Watt had courage. He crawled to his feet, removing the lamp-shade.</p>
   <p>“Contract release!” he snapped. “You madman! Don’t you realize what you’ve done? DeeDee’s walking out on me. DeeDee, don’t go. We will bring Raoul back -”</p>
   <p>“Raoul told me to quit if he quit,” DeeDee said stubbornly.</p>
   <p>“You don’t have to do what St. Cyr tells you,” Erika said, hanging onto the struggling star.</p>
   <p>“Don’t I?” DeeDee asked, astonished. “Yes, I do. I always have.”</p>
   <p>“DeeDee,” Watt said frantically, “I’ll give you the finest contract on earth - a ten-year contract - look, here it is.” He tore out a well-creased document. “All you have to do is sign, and you can have anything you want. Wouldn’t you like that?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, yes,” DeeDee said. “But Raoul wouldn’t like it.” She broke free from Erika.</p>
   <p>“Martin!” Watt told the playwright frantically, “Get St. Cyr back. Apologize to him. I don’t care how, but get him back! If you don’t, I-I’ll never give you your release.”</p>
   <p>Martin was observed to slump slightly-perhaps with hopelessness. Then, again, perhaps not.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry,” DeeDee said. “I liked working for you, Tolliver. But I have to do what Raoul says, of course.” And she moved toward the window.</p>
   <p>Martin had slumped further down, till his knuckles quite brushed the rug. His angry little eyes, glowing with baffled rage, were fixed on DeeDee. Slowly his lips peeled back, exposing every tooth in his head.</p>
   <p>“You,” he said, in an ominous growl.</p>
   <p>DeeDee paused, but only briefly.</p>
   <p>Then the enraged roar of a wild beast reverberated through the room. “You come back!” bellowed the infuriated Mammoth-Slayer, and with one agile bound sprang to the window, seized DeeDee and slung her under one arm. Wheeling, he glared jealously at the shrinking Watt and reached for Erika. In a trice he had the struggling forms of both girls captive, one under each arm. His wicked little eyes glanced from one to another. Then, playing no favorites, he bit each quickly on the ear.</p>
   <p>“Nick!” Erika cried. “How dare you!”</p>
   <p>“Mine,” Mammoth-Slayer informed her hoarsely.</p>
   <p>“You bet I am,” Erika said, “but that works both ways. Put down that hussy you’ve got under your other arm.”</p>
   <p>Mammoth-Slayer was observed to eye DeeDee doubtfully.</p>
   <p>“Well,” Erika said tartly, “make up your mind.”</p>
   <p>“Both,” said the uncivilized playwright. “Yes.”</p>
   <p>“No!” Erika said.</p>
   <p>“Yes,” DeeDee breathed in an entirely new tone. Limp as a dishrag, the lovely creature hung from Martin’s arm and gazed up at her captor with idolatrous admiration.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, you hussy,” Erika said. “What about St. Cyr?”</p>
   <p>“Him,” DeeDee said scornfully. “He hasn’t got a thing, the sissy. I’ll never look at him again.” She turned her adoring gaze back to Martin.</p>
   <p>“Pah,” the latter grunted, tossing DeeDee into Watt’s lap. “Yours. Keep her.” He grinned approvingly at Erika. “Strong she. Better.”</p>
   <p>Both Watt and DeeDee remained motionless, staring at Martin.</p>
   <p>“You,” he said, thrusting a finger at DeeDee. “You stay with him. Ha?” He indicated Watt.</p>
   <p>DeeDee nodded in slavish adoration.</p>
   <p>“You sign contract?”</p>
   <p>Nod.</p>
   <p>Martin looked significantly into Watt’s eyes. He extended his hand.</p>
   <p>“The contract release,” Erika explained, upside-down. “Give it to him before he pulls your head off.”</p>
   <p>Slowly Watt pulled the contract release from his pocket and held it out. But Martin was already shambling toward the window. Erika reached back hastily and snatched the document.</p>
   <p>“That was a wonderful act,” she told Nick, as they reached the street. “Put me down now. We can find a cab some-”</p>
   <p>“No act,” Martin growled. “Real. Till tomorrow. After that -” He shrugged. “But tonight, Mammoth-Slayer.” He attempted to climb a palm tree, changed his mind, and shambled on, carrying the now pensive Erika. But it was not until a police car drove past that Erika screamed… .</p>
   <p>“I’ll bail you out tomorrow,” Erika told Mammoth-Slayer, struggling between two large patrolmen.</p>
   <p>Her words were drowned in an infuriated bellow.</p>
   <p>Thereafter events blurred, to solidify again for the irate Mammoth-Slayer only when he was thrown in a cell, where he picked himself up with a threatening roar. “I kill!” he announced, seizing the bars.</p>
   <p>“Arrrgh!”</p>
   <p>“Two in one night,” said a bored voice, moving away outside. “Both in Bel-Air, too. Think they’re hopped up? We couldn’t get a coherent story out of either one.”</p>
   <p>The bars shook. “An annoyed voice from one of the bunks said to shut up, and added that there had been already enough trouble from nincompoops without-here it paused, hesitated, and uttered a shrill, sharp, piercing cry.</p>
   <p>Silence prevailed, momentarily, in the cell-block as Mammoth-Slayer, son of the Great Hairy One, turned slowly to face Raoul St. Cyr.</p>

    <p>VINTAGE SEASON</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Three people came up the walk to the old mansion just at dawn on a perfect May morning. Oliver Wilson in his pajamas watched them from an upper window through a haze of conflicting emotions, resentment predominant. He didn’t want them there.</p>
   <p>They were foreigners. He knew only that much about them. They had the curious name of Sancisco, and their first names, scrawled in loops on the lease, appeared to be Omerie, Kieph and Klia, though it was impossible as he looked down upon them now to sort them out by signature. He hadn’t even been sure whether they would be men or women, and he had expected something a little less cosmopolitan.</p>
   <p>Oliver’s heart sank a little as he watched them follow the taxi driver up the walk. He had hoped for less self-assurance in his unwelcome tenants, because he meant to force them out of the house if he could. It didn’t look very promising from here.</p>
   <p>The man went first. He was tall and dark, and he wore his clothes and carried his body with that peculiar arrogant assurance that comes from perfect confidence in every phase of one’s being. The two women were laughing as they followed him. Their voices were light and sweet, and their faces were beautiful, each in its own exotic way, but the first thing Oliver thought of when he looked at them was, Expensive!</p>
   <p>It was not only that patina of perfection that seemed to dwell in every line of their incredibly flawless garments. There are degrees of wealth beyond which wealth itself ceases to have significance. Oliver had seen before, on rare occasions, something like this assurance that the earth turning beneath their well-shod feet turned only to their whim.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>It puzzled him a little in this case, because he had the feeling as the three came up the walk that the beautiful clothing they wore so confidently was not clothing they were accustomed to. There was a curious air of condescension in the way they moved. Like women in costume. They minced a little on their delicate high heels, held out an arm to stare at the cut of a sleeve, twisted now and then inside their garments as if the clothing sat strangely on them, as if they were accustomed to something entirely different.</p>
   <p>And there was an elegance about the way the garments fitted them which even to Oliver looked strikingly unusual. Only an actress on the screen, who can stop time and the film to adjust every disarrayed fold so that she looks perpetually perfect, might appear thus elegantly clad. But let these women move as they liked, and each fold of their clothing followed perfectly with the movement and fell perfectly into place again. One might almost suspect the garments were not cut of ordinary cloth, or that they were cut according to some unknown, subtle scheme, with many artful hidden seams placed by a tailor incredibly skilled at his trade.</p>
   <p>They seemed excited. They talked in high, clear, very sweet voices, looking up at the perfect blue and transparent sky in which dawn was still frankly pink. They looked at the trees on the lawn, the leaves translucently green with an under color of golden newness, the edges crimped from constriction in the recent bud.</p>
   <p>Happily and with excitement in their voices they called to the man, and when he answered his own voice blended so perfectly in cadence with theirs that it sounded like three people singing together. Their voices, like their clothing, seemed to have an elegance far beyond the ordinary, to be under a control such as Oliver Wilson had never dreamed of before this morning.</p>
   <p>The taxi driver brought up the luggage, which was of a beautiful pale stuff that did not look quite like leather, and had curves in it so subtle it seemed square until you saw how two or three pieces of it fitted together when carried, into a perfectly balanced block. It was scuffed, as if from much use. And though there was a great deal of it, the taxi man did not seem to find his burden heavy. Oliver saw him look down at it now and then and heft the weight incredulously.</p>
   <p>One of the women had very black hair and skin like cream, and smoke-blue eyes heavy-lidded with the weight of her lashes. It was the other woman Oliver’s gaze followed as she came up the walk. Her hair was a clear, pale red, and her face had a softness that he thought would be like velvet to touch. She was tanned to a warm amber darker than her hair.</p>
   <p>Just as they reached the porch steps the fair woman lifted her head and looked up. She gazed straight into Oliver’s eyes and he saw that hers were very blue, and just a little amused, as if she had known he was there all along. Also they were frankly admiring.</p>
   <p>Feeling a bit dizzy, Oliver hurried back to his room to dress.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“We are here on a vacation,” the dark man said, accepting the keys. “We will not wish to be disturbed, as I made clear in our correspondence. You have engaged a cook and housemaid for us, I understand? We will expect you to move your own belongings out of the house, then, and -”</p>
   <p>“Wait,” Oliver said uncomfortably: “Something’s come up. I -” He hesitated, not sure just how to present it. These were such increasingly odd people. Even their speech was odd. They spoke so distinctly, not slurring any of the words into contractions. English seemed as familiar to them as a native tongue, but they all spoke as trained singers sing, with perfect breath control and voice placement.</p>
   <p>And there was a coldness in the man’s voice, as if some gulf lay between him and Oliver, so deep no feeling of human contact could bridge it.</p>
   <p>“I wonder,” Oliver said, “if I could find you better living quarters somewhere else in town. There’s a place across the street that -”</p>
   <p>The dark woman said, “Oh, no!” in a lightly horrified voice, and all three of them laughed. It was cool, distant laughter that did not include Oliver.</p>
   <p>The dark man said, “We chose this house carefully, Mr. Wilson. We would not be interested in living anywhere else.”</p>
   <p>Oliver said desperately, “I don’t see why. It isn’t even a modem house. I have two others in much better condition. Even across the street you’d have a fine view of the city. Here there isn’t anything. The other houses cut off the view, and -”</p>
   <p>“We engaged rooms here, Mr. Wilson,” the man said with finality. “We expect to use them. Now will you make arrangements to leave as soon as possible?”</p>
   <p>Oliver said, “No,” and looked stubborn. “That isn’t in the lease. You can live here until next month, since you paid for it, but you can’t put me out. I’m staying.”</p>
   <p>The man opened his mouth to say something. He looked coldly at Oliver and closed it again. The feeling of aloofness was chill between them. There was a moment’s silence. Then the man said, “Very well. Be kind enough to stay out of our way.”</p>
   <p>It was a little odd that he didn’t inquire into Oliver’s motives. Oliver was not yet sure enough of the man to explain. He couldn’t very well say, “Since the lease was signed, I’ve been offered three times what the house is worth if I’ll sell it before the end of May.” He couldn’t say, “I want the money, and I’m going to use my own nuisance - value to annoy you until you’re willing to move out.” After all, there seemed no reason why they shouldn’t. After seeing them, there seemed doubly no reason, for it was clear they must be accustomed to surroundings infinitely better than this timeworn old house.</p>
   <p>It was very strange, the value this house had so suddenly acquired. There was no reason at all why two groups of semi-anonymous people should be so eager to possess it for the month of May.</p>
   <p>In silence Oliver showed his tenants upstairs to the three big bedrooms across the front of the house. He was intensely conscious of the red-haired woman and the way she watched him with a sort of obviously covert interest, quite warmly, and with a curious undertone to her interest that he could not quite place. It was familiar, but elusive. He thought how pleasant it would be to talk to her alone, if only to try to capture that elusive attitude and put a name to it.</p>
   <p>Afterward he went down to the telephone and called his fiancée.</p>
   <p>Sue’s voice squeaked a little with excitement over the wire.</p>
   <p>“Oliver, so early? Why, it’s hardly six yet. Did you tell them what I said? Are they going to go?”</p>
   <p>“Can’t tell yet. I doubt it. After all, Sue, I did take their money, you know.”</p>
   <p>“Oliver, they’ve got to go! You’ve got to do something!”</p>
   <p>“I’m trying, Sue. But I don’t like it.”</p>
   <p>“Well, there isn’t any reason why they shouldn’t stay somewhere else. And we’re going to need that money. You’ll just have to think of something, Oliver.”</p>
   <p>Oliver met his own worried eyes in the mirror above the telephone and scowled at himself. His straw-colored hair was tangled and there was a shining stubble on his pleasant, tanned face. He was sorry the red-haired woman had first seen him in his untidy condition. Then his conscience smote him at the sound of Sue’s determined voice and he said:</p>
   <p>“I’ll try, darling. I’ll try. But I did take their money.”</p>
   <p>They had, in fact, paid a great deal of money, considerably more than the rooms were worth even in that year of high prices and high wages. The country was just moving into one of those fabulous eras which are later referred to as the Gay Forties or the Golden Sixties - a pleasant period of national euphoria. It was a stimulating time to be alive - while it lasted.</p>
   <p>“All right,” Oliver said resignedly. “I’ll do my best.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>But he was conscious, as the next few days went by, that he was not doing his best. There were several reasons for that. From the beginning the idea of making himself a nuisance to his tenants had been Sue’s, not Oliver’s. And if Oliver had been a little less determined the whole project would never have got under way. Reason was on Sue’s side, but-For one thing, the tenants were so fascinating. All they said and did had a queer sort of inversion to it, as if a mirror had been held up to ordinary living and in the reflection showed strange variations from the norm. Their minds worked on a different basic premise, Oliver thought, from his own. They seemed to derive covert amusement from the most unamusing things; they patronized, they were aloof with a quality of cold detachment which did not prevent them from laughing inexplicably far too often for Oliver’s comfort.</p>
   <p>He saw them occasionally, on their way to and from their rooms. They were polite and distant, not, he suspected, from anger at his presence but from sheer indifference.</p>
   <p>Most of the day they spent out of the house. The perfect May weather held unbroken and they seemed to give themselves up wholeheartedly to admiration of it, entirely confident that the warm, pale-gold sunshine and the scented air would not be interrupted by rain or cold. They were so sure of it that Oliver felt uneasy.</p>
   <p>They took only one meal a day in the house, a late dinner. And their reactions to the meal were unpredictable. Laughter greeted some of the dishes, and a sort of delicate disgust others. No one would touch the salad, for instance. And the fish seemed to cause a wave of queer embarrassment around the table.</p>
   <p>They dressed elaborately for each dinner. The man - his name was Omerie - looked extremely handsome in his dinner clothes, but he seemed a little sulky and Oliver twice heard the women laughing because he had to wear black. Oliver entertained a sudden vision, for no reason, of the man in garments as bright and as subtly cut as the women’s, and it seemed somehow very right for him. He wore even the dark clothing with a certain flamboyance, as if cloth-of-gold would be more normal for him.</p>
   <p>When they were in the house at other mealtimes, they ate in their rooms. They must have brought a great deal of food with them, from whatever mysterious place they had come. Oliver wondered with increasing curiosity where it might be. Delicious odors drifted into the hail sometimes, at odd hours, from their closed doors. Oliver could not identify them, but almost always they smelled irresistible. A few times the food smell was rather shockingly unpleasant, almost nauseating. It takes a connoisseur, Oliver reflected, to appreciate the decadent. And these people, most certainly, were connoisseurs.</p>
   <p>Why they lived so contentedly in this huge ramshackle old house was a question that disturbed his dreams at night. Or why they refused to move. He caught some fascinating glimpses into their rooms, which appeared to have been changed almost completely by additions he could not have defined very clearly from the brief sights he had of them. The feeling of luxury which his first glance at them had evoked was confirmed by the richness of the hangings they had apparently brought with them, the half-glimpsed ornaments, the pictures on the walls, even the whiffs of exotic perfume that floated from half-open doors.</p>
   <p>He saw the women go by him in the halls, moving softly through the brown dimness in their gowns so uncannily perfect in fit, so lushly rich, so glowingly colored they seemed unreal. That poise born of confidence in the subservience of the world gave them an imperious aloofness, but more than once Oliver, meeting the blue gaze of the woman with the red hair and the soft, tanned skin, thought he saw quickened interest there. She smiled at him in the dimness and went by in a haze of fragrance and a halo of incredible richness, and the warmth of the smile lingered after she had gone.</p>
   <p>He knew she did not mean this aloofness to last between them. From the very first he was sure of that. When the time came she would make the opportunity to be alone with him. The thought was confusing and tremendously exciting. There was nothing he could do but wait, knowing she would see him when it suited her.</p>

   <p>On the third day he lunched with Sue in a little downtown restaurant overlooking the great sweep of the metropolis across the river far below. Sue had shining brown curls and brown eyes, and her chin was a bit more prominent than is strictly accordant with beauty. From childhood Sue had known what she wanted and how to get it, and it seemed to Oliver just now that she had never wanted anything quite so much as the sale of this house.</p>
   <p>“It’s such a marvelous offer for the old mausoleum,” she said, breaking into a roil with a gesture of violence. “We’ll never have a chance like that again, and prices are so high we’ll need the money to start housekeeping. Surely you can do something, Oliver!”</p>
   <p>“I’m trying,” Oliver assured her uncomfortably.</p>
   <p>“Have you heard anything more from that madwoman who wants to buy it?”</p>
   <p>Oliver shook his head. “Her attorney phoned again yesterday. Nothing new. I wonder who she is.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t think even the attorney knows. All this mystery - I don’t like it, Oliver. Even those Sancisco people - What did they do today?”</p>
   <p>Oliver laughed. “They spent about an hour this morning telephoning movie theaters in the city, checking up on a lot of third-rate films they want to see parts of.”</p>
   <p>“Parts of? But why?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know. I think… oh, nothing. More coffee?”</p>
   <p>The trouble was, he thought he did know. It was too unlikely a guess to tell Sue about, and without familiarity with the Sancisco oddities she would only think Oliver was losing his mind. But he had from their talk, a definite impression that there was an actor in bit parts in all these films whose performances they mentioned with something very near to awe. They referred to him as Golconda, which didn’t appear to be his name, so that Oliver had no way of guessing which obscure bit-player it was they admired so deeply. Golconda might have been the name of a character he had once played-and with superlative skill, judging by the comments of the Sanciscos - but to Oliver he meant nothing at all.</p>
   <p>“They do funny things,” he said, stirring his coffee reflectively. “Yesterday Omerie - that’s the man - came in with a book of poems published about five years ago, and all of them handled it like a first edition of Shakespeare. I never even heard of the author, but he seems to be a tin god in their country, wherever that is.”</p>
   <p>“You still don’t know? Haven’t they even dropped any hints?”</p>
   <p>“We don’t do much talking,” Oliver reminded her with some irony.</p>
   <p>“I know, but - Oh, well, I guess it doesn’t matter. Go on, what else do they do?”</p>
   <p>“Well, this morning they were going to spend studying ‘Golconda’ and his great art, and this afternoon I think they’re taking a trip up the river to some sort of shrine I never heard of. It isn’t very far, wherever it is, because I know they’re coming back for dinner. Some great man’s birthplace, I think-they promised to take home souvenirs of the place if they could get any. They’re typical tourists, all right-if I could only figure out what’s behind the whole thing. It doesn’t make sense.”</p>
   <p>“Nothing about that house makes sense any more. I do wish -”</p>
   <p>She went on in a petulant voice, but Oliver ceased suddenly to hear her, because just outside the door, walking with imperial elegance on her high heels, a familiar figure passed. He did not see her face, but he thought he would know that poise, that richness of line and motion, anywhere on earth.</p>
   <p>“Excuse me a minute,” he muttered to Sue, and was out of his chair before she could speak. He made the door in half a dozen long strides, and the beautifully elegant passerby was only a few steps away when he got there. Then, with the words he had meant to speak already half-uttered, he fell silent and stood there staring.</p>
   <p>It was not the red-haired woman. It was not her dark companion. It was a stranger. He watched, speechless, while the lovely, imperious creature moved on through the crowd and vanished, moving with familiar poise and assurance and an equally familiar strangeness as if the beautiful and exquisitely fitted garments she wore were an exotic costume to her, as they had always seemed to the Sancisco women. Every other woman on the street looked untidy and ill at ease beside her. Walking like a queen, she melted into the crowd and was gone.</p>
   <p>She came from their country, Oliver told himself dizzily. So someone else nearby had mysterious tenants in this month of perfect May weather. Someone else was puzzling in vain today over the strangeness of the people from the nameless land.</p>
   <p>In silence he went back to Sue.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The door stood invitingly ajar in the brown dimness of the upper hall. Oliver’s steps slowed as he drew near it, and his heart began to quicken correspondingly. It was the red-haired woman’s room, and he thought the door was not open by accident. Her name, he knew now, was Kleph.</p>
   <p>The door creaked a little on its hinges and from within a very sweet voice said lazily, “Won’t you come in?”</p>
   <p>The room looked very different indeed. The big bed had been pushed back against the wall and a cover thrown over it that brushed the floor all around looked like soft-haired fur except that it was a pale blue-green and sparkled as if every hair were tipped with invisible crystals. Three books lay open on the fur, and a very curious-looking magazine with faintly luminous printing and a page of pictures that at first glance appeared three-dimensional. Also a tiny porcelain pipe encrusted with porcelain flowers, and a thin wisp of smoke floating from the bowl.</p>
   <p>Above the bed a broad picture hung, framing a square of blue water so real Oliver had to look twice to be sure it was not rippling gently from left to right. From the ceiling swung a crystal globe on a glass cord. It turned gently, the light from the windows making curved rectangles in its sides.</p>
   <p>Under the center window a sort of chaise longue stood which Oliver had not seen before. He could only assume it was at least partly pneumatic and had been brought in the luggage. There was a very rich-looking quilted cloth covering and hiding it, embossed all over in shining metallic patterns.</p>
   <p>Kleph moved slowly from the door and sank upon the chaise longue with a little sigh of content. The couch accommodated itself to her body with what looked like delightful comfort. Kleph wriggled a little and then smiled up at Oliver.</p>
   <p>“Do come on in. Sit over there, where you can see out the window. I love your beautiful spring weather. You know, there never was a May like it in civilized times.” She said that quite seriously, her blue eyes on Oliver’s, and there was a hint of patronage in her voice, as if the weather had been arranged especially for her.</p>
   <p>Oliver started across the room and then paused and looked down in amazement at the floor, which felt unstable. He had not noticed before that the carpet was pure white, unspotted, and sank about an inch under the pressure of the feet. He saw then that Kleph’s feet were bare, or almost bare. She wore something like gossamer buskins of filmy net, fitting her feet exactly. The bare soles were pink as if they had been rouged, and the nails had a liquid gleam like tiny mirrors. He moved closer, and was not as surprised as he should have been to see that they really were tiny mirrors, painted with some lacquer that gave them reflecting surfaces.</p>
   <p>“Do sit down,” Kleph said again, waving a white-sleeved arm toward a chair by the window. She wore a garment that looked like short, soft down, loosely cut but following perfectly every motion she made. And there was something curiously different about her very shape today. When Oliver saw her in street clothes, she had the square-shouldered, slim-flanked figure that all women strove for, but here in her lounging robe she looked-well, different. There was an almost swanlike slope to her shoulders today, a roundness and softness to her body that looked unfamiliar and very appealing.</p>
   <p>“Will you have some tea?” Kleph asked, and smiled charmingly.</p>
   <p>A low table beside her held a tray and several small covered cups, lovely things with an inner glow like rose quartz, the color shining deeply as if from within layer upon layer of translucence. She took up one of the cups-there were no saucers-and offered it to Oliver.</p>
   <p>It felt fragile and thin as paper in his hand. He could not see the contents because of the cup’s cover, which seemed to be one with the cup itself and left only a thin open crescent at the rim. Steam rose from the opening.</p>
   <p>Kleph took up a cup of her own and tilted it to her lips, smiling at Oliver over the rim. She was very beautiful. The pale red hair lay in shining loops against her head and the corona of curls like a halo above her forehead might have been pressed down like a wreath. Every hair kept order as perfectly as if it had been painted on, though the breeze from the window stirred now and then among the softly shining strands.</p>
   <p>Oliver tried the tea. Its flavor was exquisite, very hot, and the taste that lingered upon his tongue was like the scent of flowers. It was an extremely. feminine drink. He sipped again, surprised to find how much he liked it.</p>
   <p>The scent of flowers seemed to increase as he drank, swirling through his head like smoke. After the third sip there was a faint buzzing in his ears. The bees among the flowers, perhaps, he thought incoherently - and sipped again.</p>
   <p>Kleph watched him, smiling.</p>
   <p>“The others will be out all afternoon,” she told Oliver comfortably. “I thought it would give us a pleasant time to be acquainted.”</p>
   <p>Oliver was rather horrified to hear himself saying, “What makes you talk like that?” He had had no idea of asking the question; something seemed to have loosened his control over his own tongue.</p>
   <p>Kleph’s smile deepened. She tipped the cup to her lips and there was indulgence in her voice when she said, “What do you mean ‘like that?’”</p>
   <p>He waved his hand vaguely, noting with some surprise that at a glance it seemed to have six or seven fingers as it moved past his face.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know - precision, I guess. Why don’t you say ‘don’t,’ for instance?”</p>
   <p>“In our country we are trained to speak with precision,” Kleph explained. “Just as we are trained to move and dress and think with precision. Any slovenliness is trained out of us in childhood. With you, of course -” She was polite. “With you, this does not happen to be a national fetish. With us, we have time for the amenities. We like them.”</p>
   <p>Her voice had grown sweeter and sweeter as she spoke, until by now it was almost indistinguishable from the sweetness of the flower-scent in Oliver’s head, and the delicate flavor of the tea.</p>
   <p>“What country do you come from?” he asked, and tilted the cup again to drink, mildly surprised to notice that it seemed inexhaustible.</p>
   <p>Kleph’s smile was definitely patronizing this time. It didn’t irritate him. Nothing could irritate him just now. The whole room swam in a beautiful rosy glow as fragrant as the flowers.</p>
   <p>“We must not speak of that, Mr. Wilson.”</p>
   <p>“But -” Oliver paused. After all, it was, of course, none of his business. “This is a vacation?” he asked vaguely.</p>
   <p>“Call it a pilgrimage, perhaps.”</p>
   <p>“Pilgrimage?” Oliver was so interested that for an instant his mind came back into sharp focus. “To - what?”</p>
   <p>“I should not have said that, Mr. Wilson. Please forget it. Do you like the tea?”</p>
   <p>“Very much.”</p>
   <p>“You will have guessed by now that it is not only tea, but an euphoriac.”</p>
   <p>Oliver stared. “Euphoriac?”</p>
   <p>Kieph made a descriptive circle in the air with one graceful hand, and laughed. “You do not feel the effects yet? Surely you do?”</p>
   <p>“I feel,” Oliver said, “the way I’d feel after four whiskeys.”</p>
   <p>Kleph shuddered delicately. “We get our euphoria less painfully. And without the aftereffects your barbarous alcohols used to have.”</p>
   <p>She bit her lip. “Sorry. I must be euphoric myself to speak so freely. Please forgive me. Shall we have some music?”</p>
   <p>Kleph leaned backward on the chaise longue and reached toward the wall beside her. The sleeve, falling away from her round tanned arm, left bare the inside of the wrist, and Oliver was startled to see there a long, rosy streak of fading scar. His inhibitions had dissolved in the fumes of the fragrant tea; he caught his breath and leaned forward to stare.</p>
   <p>Kleph shook the sleeve back over the scar with a quick gesture. Color came into her face beneath the softly tinted tan and she would not meet Oliver’s eyes. A queer shame seemed to have fallen upon her.</p>
   <p>Oliver said tactlessly, “What is it? What’s the matter?”</p>
   <p>Still she would not look at him. Much later he understood that shame and knew she had reason for it. Now he listened blankly as she said:</p>
   <p>“Nothing… nothing at all. A… an inoculation. All of us. oh, never mind. Listen to the music.”</p>
   <p>This time she reached out with the other arm. She touched nothing, but when she had held her hand near the wall a sound breathed through the room. It was the sound of water, the sighing of waves receding upon long, sloped beaches. Oliver followed Kleph’s gaze toward the picture of the blue water above the bed.</p>
   <p>The waves there were moving. More than that, the point of vision moved. Slowly the seascape drifted past, moving with the waves, following them toward shore. Oliver watched, half-hypnotized by a motion that seemed at the time quite acceptable and not in the least surprising.</p>
   <p>The waves lifted and broke in creaming foam and ran seething up a sandy beach. Then through the sound of the water music began to breathe, and through the water itself a man’s face dawned in the frame, smiling intimately into the room. He held an oddly archaic musical instrument, lute-shaped, its body striped light and dark like a melon and its long neck bent back over his shoulder. He was singing, and Oliver felt mildly astonished at the song. It was very familiar and very odd indeed. He groped through the unfamiliar rhythms and found at last a thread to catch the tune by - it was “Make-Believe,” from “Showboat,” but certainly a showboat that had never steamed up the Mississippi.</p>
   <p>“What’s he doing to it?” he demanded after a few moments of outraged listening. “I never heard anything like it!”</p>
   <p>Kleph laughed and stretched out her arm again. Enigmatically she said, “We call it kyling. Never mind. How do you like this?”</p>
   <p>It was a comedian, a man in semi-clown make-up, his eyes exaggerated so that they seemed to cover half his face. He stood by a broad glass pillar before a dark curtain and sang a gay, staccato song interspersed with patter that sounded impromptu, and all the while his left hand did an intricate, musical tattoo of the nailtips on the glass of the column. He strolled around and around it as he sang. The rhythms of his fingernails blended with the song and swung widely away into patterns of their own, and blended again without a break.</p>
   <p>It was confusing to follow. The song made even less sense than the monologue, which had something to do with a lost slipper and was full of allusions which made Kleph smile, but were utterly unintelligible to Oliver. The man had a dry, brittle style that was not very amusing, though Kieph seemed fascinated. Oliver was interested to see in him an extension and a variation of that extreme smooth confidence which marked all three of the Sanciscos. Clearly a racial trait, he thought.</p>
   <p>Other performances followed, some of them fragmentary as if lifted out of a completer version. One he knew. The obvious, stirring melody struck his recognition before the figures-marching men against a haze, a great banner rolling backward above them in the smoke, foreground figures striding gigantically and shouting in rhythm, “Forward, forward the lily banners go!”</p>
   <p>The music was tinny, the images blurred and poorly colored, but there was a gusto about the performance that caught at Oliver’s imagination. He stared, remembering the old film from long ago. Dennis King and a ragged chorus, singing “The Song of the Vagabonds” from - was it “Vagabond King?”</p>
   <p>“A very old one,” Kleph said apologetically. “But I like it.”</p>
   <p>The steam of the intoxicating tea swirled between Oliver and the picture. Music swelled and sank through the room and the fragrant fumes and his own euphoric brain. Nothing seemed strange. He had discovered how to drink the tea. Like nitrous oxide, the effect was not cumulative. When you reached a peak of euphoria, you could not increase the peak. It was best to wait for a slight dip in the effect of the stimulant before taking more.</p>
   <p>Otherwise it had most of the effects of alcohol-everything after awhile dissolved into a delightful fog through which all he saw was uniformly enchanting and partook of the qualities of a dream. He questioned nothing. Afterward he was not certain how much of it he really had dreamed.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>There was the dancing doll, for instance. He remembered it quite clearly, in sharp focus-a tiny, slender woman with a long-nosed, dark-eyed face and a pointed chin. She moved delicately across the white rug-knee-high, exquisite. Her features were as mobile as her body, and she danced lightly, with resounding strokes of her toes, each echoing like a bell. It was a formalized sort of dance, and she sang breathlessly in accompaniment, making amusing little grimaces. Certainly it was a portrait-doll, animated to mimic the original perfectly in voice and motion. Afterward, Oliver knew he must have dreamed it.</p>
   <p>What else happened he was quite unable to remember later. He knew Kleph had said some curious things, but they all made sense at the time, and afterward he couldn’t remember a word. He knew he had been offered little glittering candies in a transparent dish, and that some of them had been delicious and one or two so bitter his tongue still curled the next day when he recalled them, and one - Kleph sucked luxuriantly on the same kind-of a taste that was actively nauseating.</p>
   <p>As for Kleph herself - he was frantically uncertain the next day what had really happened. He thought he could remember the softness of her white-downed arms clasped at the back of his neck, while she laughed up at him and exhaled into his face the flowery fragrance of the tea. But beyond that he was totally unable to recall anything, for a while.</p>
   <p>There was a brief interlude later, before the oblivion of sleep. He was almost sure he remembered a moment when the other two Sanciscos stood looking down at him, the man scowling, the smoky-eyed woman smiling a derisive smile.</p>
   <p>The man said, from a vast distance, “Kieph, you know this is against every rule -” His voice began in a thin hum and soared in fantastic flight beyond the range of hearing. Oliver thought he remembered the dark woman’s laughter, thin and distant too, and the hum of her voice like bees in flight.</p>
   <p>“Kleph, Kleph, you silly little fool, can we never trust you out of sight?”</p>
   <p>Kieph’s voice then said something that seemed to make no sense. “What does it matter, here?”</p>
   <p>The man answered in that buzzing, faraway hum. “The matter of giving your bond before you leave, not to interfere. You know you signed the rules -”</p>
   <p>Kleph’s voice, nearer and more intelligible: “But here the difference is … it does not matter here! You both know that. How could it matter?”</p>
   <p>Oliver felt the downy brush of her sleeve against his cheek, but he saw nothing except the slow, smokelike ebb and flow of darkness past his eyes. He heard the voices wrangle musically from far away, and he heard them cease.</p>
   <p>When he woke the next morning, alone in his own room, he woke with the memory of Kieph’s eyes upon him very sorrowfully, her lovely tanned face looking down on him with the red hair falling fragrantly on each side of it and sadness and compassion in her eyes. He thought he had probably dreamed that. There was no reason why anyone should look at him with such sadness.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Sue telephoned that day.</p>
   <p>“Oliver, the people who want to buy the house are here. That madwoman and her husband. Shall I bring them over?”</p>
   <p>Oliver’s mind all day had been hazy with the vague, bewildering memories of yesterday. Kleph’s face kept floating before him, blotting out the room. He said, “What? I … oh, well, bring them if you want to. I don’t see what good it’ll do.”</p>
   <p>“Oliver, what’s wrong with you? We agreed we needed the money, didn’t we? I don’t see how you can think of passing up such a wonderful bargain without even a struggle. We could get married and buy our own house right away, and you know we’ll never get such an offer again for that old trash-heap. Wake up, Oliver!”</p>
   <p>Oliver made an effort. “I know, Sue - I know. But -”</p>
   <p>“Oliver, you’ve got to think of something!” Her voice was imperious.</p>
   <p>He knew she was right. Kleph or no Kleph, the bargain shouldn’t be ignored if there was any way at all of getting the tenants out. He wondered again what made the place so suddenly priceless to so many people. And what the last week in May had to do with the value of the house.</p>
   <p>A sudden sharp curiosity pierced even the vagueness of his mind today. May’s last week was so important that the whole sale of the house stood or fell upon occupancy by then. Why? Why?</p>
   <p>“What’s going to happen next week?” he asked rhetorically of the telephone. “Why can’t they wait till these people leave? I’d knock a couple of thousand off the price if they’d -”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“You would not, Oliver Wilson! I can buy all our refrigeration units with that extra money. You’ll just have to work out some way to give possession by next week, and that’s that. You hear me?”</p>
   <p>“Keep your shirt on,” Oliver said practically. “I’m only human, but I’ll try.”</p>
   <p>“I’m bringing the people over right away,” Sue told him. “While the Sanciscos are still out. Now you put your mind to work and think of something, Oliver.” She paused, and her voice was reflective when she spoke again. “They’re… awfully odd people, darling.”</p>
   <p>“Odd?”</p>
   <p>“You’ll see.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>It was an elderly woman and a very young man who trailed Sue up the walk. Oliver knew immediately what had struck Sue about them. He was somehow not at all surprised to see that both wore their clothing with the familiar air of elegant self-consciousness he had come to know so well. They, too, looked around them at the beautiful, sunny afternoon with conscious enjoyment and an air of faint condescension. He knew before he heard them speak how musical their voices would be and how meticulously they would pronounce each word.</p>
   <p>There was no doubt about it. The people of Kleph’s mysterious country were arriving here in force-for something. For the last week of May? He shrugged mentally; there was no way of guessing-yet. One thing only was sure: all of them must come from that nameless land where people controlled their voices like singers and their garments like actors who could stop the reel of time itself to adjust every disordered fold.</p>
   <p>The elderly woman took full charge of the conversation from the start. They stood together on the rickety, unpainted porch, and Sue had no chance even for introductions.</p>
   <p>“Young man, I am Madame Hoffla. This is my husband.” Her voice had an underrunning current of harshness, which was perhaps age. And her face looked almost corsetted, the loose flesh coerced into something like firmness by some invisible method Oliver could not guess at. The make-up was so skillful he could not be certain it was make-up at all, but he had a definite feeling that she was much older than she looked. It would have taken a lifetime of command to put so much authority into the harsh, deep, musically controlled voice.</p>
   <p>The young man said nothing. He was very handsome. His type, apparently, was one that does not change much no matter in what culture or country it may occur. He wore beautifully tailored garments and carried in one gloved hand a box of red leather, about the size and shape of a book.</p>
   <p>Madame Hoffia went on. “I understand your problem about the house. You wish to sell to me, but are legally bound by your lease with Omerie and his friends. Is that right?”</p>
   <p>Oliver nodded. “But -”</p>
   <p>“Let me finish. If Omerie can be forced to vacate before next week, you will accept our offer. Right? Very well. Hara!” She nodded to the young man beside her. He jumped to instant attention, bowed slightly, said, “Yes, Hollia,” and slipped a gloved hand into his coat.</p>
   <p>Madame Hollia took the little object offered on his palm, her gesture as she reached for it almost imperial, as if royal robes swept from her outstretched arm.</p>
   <p>“Here,” she said, “is something that may help us. My dear -” She held it out to Sue - “if you can hide this somewhere about the house, I believe your unwelcome tenants will not trouble you much longer.”</p>
   <p>Sue took the thing curiously. It looked like a tiny silver box, no more than an inch square, indented at the top and with no line to show it could be opened.</p>
   <p>“Wait a minute,” Oliver broke in uneasily. “What is it?”</p>
   <p>“Nothing that will harm anyone, I assure you.”</p>
   <p>“Then what -”</p>
   <p>Madame Hollia’s imperious gesture at one sweep silenced him and commanded Sue forward. “Go on, my dear. Hurry, before Omerie comes back. I can assure you there is no danger to anyone.”</p>
   <p>Oliver broke in determinedly. “Madame Hoffia, I’ll have to know what your plans are. I -”</p>
   <p>“Oh, Oliver, please!” Sue’s fingers closed over the silver cube. “Don’t worry about it. I’m sure Madame Hoffia knows best. Don’t you want to get those people out?”</p>
   <p>“Of course I do. But I don’t want the house blown up or -”</p>
   <p>Madame Hoffla’s deep laughter was indulgent. “Nothing so crude, I promise you, Mr. Wilson. Remember, we want the house! Hurry, my dear.”</p>
   <p>Sue nodded and slipped hastily past Oliver into the hail. Outnumbered, he subsided uneasily. The young man, Hara, tapped a negligent foot and admired the sunlight as they waited. It was an afternoon as perfect as all of May had been, translucent gold, balmy with an edge of chill lingering in the air to point up a perfect contrast with the summer to come. Hara looked around him confidently, like a man paying just tribute to a stageset provided wholly for himself. He even glanced up at a drone from above and followed the course of a big transcontinental plane half dissolved in golden haze high in the sun. “Quaint,” he murmured in a gratified voice.</p>
   <p>Sue came back and slipped her hand through Oliver’s arm, squeezing excitedly. “There,” she said. “How long will it take, Madame Hollia?”</p>
   <p>“That will depend, my dear. Not very long. Now, Mr. Wilson, one word with you. You live here also, I understand? For your own comfort, take my advice and -”</p>
   <p>Somewhere within the house a door slammed and a clear high voice rang wordlessly up a rippling scale. Then there was the sound of feet on the stairs, and a single line of song. “Come hider, love, to me -”</p>
   <p>Hara started, almost dropping the red leather box he held.</p>
   <p>“Kleph!” he said in a whisper. “Or Kila. I know they both just came on from Canterbury. But I thought -”</p>
   <p>“Hush.” Madame Hoffia’s features composed themselves into an imperious blank. She breathed triumphantly through her nose, drew back upon herself and turned an imposing facade to the door.</p>
   <p>Kleph wore the same softly downy robe Oliver had seen before, except that today it was not white, but a pale, clear blue that gave her tan an apricot flush. She was smiling.</p>
   <p>“Why, Hoffia!” Her tone was at its most musical. “I thought I recognized voices from home. How nice to see you. No one knew you were coming to the -” She broke off and glanced at Oliver and then away again. “Hara, too,” she said. “What a pleasant surprise.”</p>
   <p>Sue said flatly, “When did you get back?”</p>
   <p>Kleph smiled at her. “You must be the little Miss Johnson. Why, I did not go out at all. I was tired of sightseeing. I have been napping in my room.”</p>
   <p>Sue drew in her breath in something that just escaped being a disbelieving sniff. A look flashed between the two women, and for an instant held - and that instant was timeless. It was an extraordinary pause in which a great deal of wordless interplay took place in the space of a second.</p>
   <p>Oliver saw the quality of Kieph’s smile at Sue, that same look of quiet confidence he had noticed so often about all of these strange people. He saw Sue’s quick inventory of the other woman, and he saw how Sue squared her shoulders and stood up straight, smoothing down her summer frock over her flat hips so that for an instant she stood posed consciously, looking down on Kieph. It was deliberate. Bewildered, he glanced again at Kleph.</p>
   <p>Kleph’s shoulders sloped softly, her robe was belted to a tiny waist and hung in deep folds over frankly rounded hips. Sue’s was the fashionable figure - but Sue was the first to surrender.</p>
   <p>Kieph’s smile did not falter. But in the silence there was an abrupt reversal of values, based on no more than the measureless quality of Kleph’s confidence in herself, the quiet, assured smile. It was suddenly made very clear that fashion is not a constant. Kleph’s curious, out-of-mode curves without warning became the norm, and Sue was a queer, angular, half-masculine creature beside her.</p>
   <p>Oliver had no idea how it was done. Somehow the authority passed in a breath from one woman to the other. Beauty is almost wholly a matter of fashion; what is beautiful today would have been grotesque a couple of generations ago and will be grotesque a hundred years ahead. It will be worse than grotesque; it will be outmoded and therefore faintly ridiculous.</p>
   <p>Sue was that. Kieph had only to exert her authority to make it clear to everyone on the porch. Kleph was a beauty, suddenly and very convincingly, beautiful in the accepted mode, and Sue was amusingly old-fashioned, an anachronism in her lithe, square-shouldered slimness. She did not belong. She was grotesque among these strangely immaculate people.</p>
   <p>Sue’s collapse was complete. But pride sustained her, and bewilderment. Probably she never did grasp entirely what was wrong. She gave Kieph one glance of burning resentment and when her eyes came back to Oliver there was suspicion in them, and mistrust.</p>
   <p>Looking backward later, Oliver thought that in that moment, for the first time clearly, he began to suspect the truth. But he had no time to ponder it, for after the brief instant of enmity the three people from-elsewhere - began to speak all at once, as if in a belated attempt to cover something they did not want noticed.</p>
   <p>Kleph said, “This beautiful weather -” and Madame Hollia said, “So fortunate to have this house -” and Hara, holding up the red leather box, said loudest of all, “Cenbe sent you this, Kleph. His latest.”</p>
   <p>Kleph put out both hands for it eagerly, the eiderdown sleeves falling back from her rounded arms. Oliver had a quick glimpse of that mysterious scar before the sleeve fell back, and it seemed to him that there was the faintest trace of a similar scar vanishing into Hara’s cuff as he let his own arm drop.</p>
   <p>“Cenbe!” Kleph cried, her voice high and sweet and delighted. “How wonderful! What period?”</p>
   <p>“From November 1664,” Hara said. “London, of course, though I think there may be some counterpoint from the 1347 November. He hasn’t finished - of course.” He glanced almost nervously at Oliver and Sue. “A wonderful example,” he said quickly. “Marvelous. If you have the taste for it, of course.”</p>
   <p>Madame Hoffia shuddered with ponderous delicacy.</p>
   <p>“That man!” she said. “Fascinating, of course - a great man. But - so advanced!”</p>
   <p>“It takes a connoisseur to appreciate Cenbe’s work fully,” Kleph said in a slightly tart voice. “We all admit that.”</p>
   <p>“Oh yes, we all bow to Cenbe,” Hoffia conceded. “I confess the man terrifies me a little, my dear. Do we expect him to join us?”</p>
   <p>“I suppose so,” Kleph said. “If his - work - is not yet finished, then of course. You know Cenbe’s tastes.”</p>
   <p>Hollia and Hara laughed together. “I know when to look for him, then,” Hollia said. She glanced at the staring Oliver and the subdued but angry Sue, and with a commanding effort brought the subject back into line.</p>
   <p>“So fortunate, my dear Kleph, to have this house,” she declared heavily. “I saw a tridimensional of it - afterward - and it was still quite perfect. Such a fortunate coincidence. Would you consider parting with your lease, for a consideration? Say, a coronation seat at -”</p>
   <p>“Nothing could buy us, Hoffia,” Kleph told her gaily, clasping the red box to her bosom.</p>
   <p>HoIlia gave her a cool stare. “You may change your mind, my dear Kleph,” she said pontifically. “There is stiff time. You can always reach us through Mr. Wilson here. We have rooms up the street in the Montgomery House - nothing like yours, of course, but they will do. For us, they will do.”</p>
   <p>Oliver blinked. The Montgomery House was the most expensive hotel in town. Compared to this collapsing old ruin, it was a palace. There was no understanding these people. Their values seemed to have suffered a complete reversal.</p>
   <p>Madame Hollia moved majestically toward the steps.</p>
   <p>“Very pleasant to see you, my dear,” she said over one well-padded shoulder. “Enjoy your stay. My regards to Omerie and Klia. Mr. Wilson -” she nodded toward the walk. “A word with you.”</p>
   <p>Oliver followed her down toward the street. Madame Hollia paused halfway there and touched his arm.</p>
   <p>“One word of advice,” she said huskily. “You say you sleep here? Move out, young man. Move out before tonight.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Oliver was searching in a half-desultory fashion for the hiding place Sue had found for the mysterious silver cube, when the first sounds from above began to drift down the stairwell toward him. Kleph had closed her door, but the house was old, and strange qualities in the noise overhead seemed to seep through the woodwork like an almost visible stain.</p>
   <p>It was music, in a way. But much more than music. And it was a terrible sound, the sounds of calamity and of all human reaction to calamity, everything from hysteria to heartbreak, from irrational joy to rationalized acceptance.</p>
   <p>The calamity was-single. The music did not attempt to correlate all human sorrows; it focused sharply upon one and followed the ramifications out and out. Oliver recognized these basics to the sounds in a very brief moment. They were essentials, and they seemed to beat into his brain with the first strains of the music which was so much more than music.</p>
   <p>But when he lifted his head to listen he lost all grasp upon the meaning of the noise and it was sheer medley and confusion. To think of it was to blur it hopelessly in the mind, and he could not recapture that first instant of unreasoning acceptance.</p>
   <p>He went upstairs almost in a daze, hardly knowing what he was doing. He pushed Kleph’s door open. He looked inside-What he saw there he could not afterward remember except in a blurring as vague as the blurred ideas the music roused in his brain. Half the room had vanished behind a mist, and the mist was a three-dimensional screen upon which were projected - He had no words for them. He was not even sure if the projections were visual. The mist was spinning with motion and sound, but essentially it was neither sound nor motion that Oliver saw.</p>
   <p>This was a work of art. Oliver knew no name for it. It transcended all art-forms he knew, blended them, and out of the blend produced subtleties his mind could not begin to grasp. Basically, this was the attempt of a master composer to correlate every essential aspect of a vast human experience into something that could be conveyed in a few moments to every sense at once.</p>
   <p>The shifting visions on the screen were not pictures in themselves, but hints of pictures, subtly selected outlines that plucked at the mind and with one deft touch set whole chords ringing through the memory. Perhaps each beholder reacted differently, since it was in the eye and the mind of the beholder that the truth of the picture lay. No two would be aware of the same symphonic panorama, but each would see essentially the same terrible story unfold.</p>
   <p>Every sense was touched by that deft and merciless genius. Color and shape and motion flickered in the screen, hinting much, evoking unbearable memories deep in the mind; odors floated from the screen and touched the heart of the beholder more poignantly than anything visual could do. The skin crawled sometimes as if to a tangible cold hand laid upon it. The tongue curled with remembered bitterness and remembered sweet.</p>
   <p>It was outrageous. It violated the innermost privacies of a man’s mind, called up secret things long ago walled off behind mental scar tissue, forced its terrible message upon the beholder relentlessly though the mind might threaten to crack beneath the stress of it.</p>
   <p>And yet, in spite of all this vivid awareness, Oliver did not know what calamity the screen portrayed. That it was real, vast, overwhelmingly dreadful he could not doubt. That it had once happened was unmistakable. He caught flashing glimpses of human faces distorted with grief and disease and death-real faces, faces that had once lived and were seen now in the instant of dying. He saw men and women in rich clothing superimposed in panorama upon reeling thousands of ragged folk, great throngs of them swept past the sight in an instant, and he saw that death made no distinction among them.</p>
   <p>He saw lovely women laugh and shake their curls, and the laughter shriek into hysteria and the hysteria into music. He saw one man’s face, over and over-a long, dark, saturnine face, deeply lined, sorrowful, the face of a powerful man wise in worldliness, urbane-and helpless. That face was for awhile a recurring motif, always more tortured, more helpless than before.</p>
   <p>The music broke off in the midst of a rising glide. The mist vanished and the room reappeared before him. The anguished dark face for an instant seemed to Oliver printed everywhere he looked, like after-vision on the eyelids. He knew that face. He had seen it before, not often, but he should know its name- “Oliver, Oliver-” Kleph’s sweet voice came out of a fog at him.</p>
   <p>He was leaning dizzily against the doorpost looking down into her eyes. She, too, had that dazed blankness he must show on his own face. The power of the dreadful symphony still held them both. But even in this confused moment Oliver saw that Kieph had been enjoying the experience.</p>
   <p>He felt sickened to the depths of his mind, dizzy with sickness and revulsion because of the superimposing of human miseries he had just beheld. But Kleph - only appreciation showed upon her face. To her it had been magnificence, and magnificence only.</p>
   <p>Irrelevantly Oliver remembered the nauseating candies she had enjoyed, the nauseating odors of strange food that drifted sometimes through the hail from her room.</p>
   <p>What was it she had said downstairs a little while ago? Connoisseur, that was it. Only a connoisseur could appreciate work as - as advanced - as the work of someone called Cenbe.</p>
   <p>A whiff of intoxicating sweetness curled past Oliver’s face. Something cool and smooth was pressed into his hand.</p>
   <p>“Oh, Oliver, I am so sorry,” Kleph’s voice murmured contritely. “Here, drink the euphoriac and you will feel better. Please drink!”</p>
   <p>The familiar fragrance of the hot sweet tea was on his tongue before he knew he had complied. Its relaxing fumes floated up through his brain and in a moment or two the world felt stable around him again. The room was as it had always been. And Kieph - Her eyes were very bright. Sympathy showed in them for him, but for herself she was still brimmed with the high elation of what she had just been experiencing.</p>
   <p>“Come and sit down,” she said gently, tugging at his arm. “I am so sorry- I should not have played that over, where you could hear it. I have no excuse, really. It was only that I forgot what the effect might be on one who had never heard Cenbe’s symphonies before. I was so impatient to see what he had done with… with his new subject. I am so very sorry, Oliver!”</p>
   <p>“What was it?” His voice sounded steadier than he had expected. The tea was responsible for that. He sipped again, glad of the consoling euphoria its fragrance brought.</p>
   <p>“A … a composite interpretation of … oh, Oliver, you know I must not answer questions!”</p>
   <p>“But-”</p>
   <p>“No-drink your tea and forget what it was you saw. Think of other things. Here, we will have music-another kind of music, something gay-”</p>
   <p>She reached for the wall beside the window, and as before, Oliver saw the broad framed picture of blue water above the bed ripple and grow pale. Through it another scene began to dawn like shapes rising beneath the surface of the sea.</p>
   <p>He had a glimpse of a dark-curtained stage upon which a man in a tight dark tunic and hose moved with a restless, sidelong pace, his hands and face startingly pale against the black about him. He limped; he had a crooked back and he spoke familiar lines. Oliver had seen John Barryrnore once as the crook-backed Richard, and it seemed vaguely outrageous to him that any other actor should essay that difficult part. This one he had never seen before, but the man had a fascinatingly smooth manner and his interpretation of the Plantagenet king was quite new and something Shakespeare probably never dreamed of.</p>
   <p>“No,” Kleph said, “not this. Nothing gloomy.” And she put out her hand again. The nameless new Richard faded and there was a swirl of changing pictures and changing voices, all blurred together, before the scene steadied upon a stageful of dancers in pastel ballet skirts, drifting effortlessly through some complicated pattern of motion. The music that went with it was light and effortless too. The room filled up with the clear, floating melody.</p>
   <p>Oliver set down his cup. He felt much surer of himself now, and he thought the euphoriac had done all it could for him. He didn’t want to blur again mentally. There were things he meant to learn about. Now. He considered how to begin.</p>
   <p>Kleph was watching him. “That Hoffia,” she said suddenly. “She wants to buy the house?”</p>
   <p>Oliver nodded. “She’s offering a lot of money. Sue’s going to be awfully disappointed if -” He hesitated. Perhaps, after all, Sue would not be disappointed. He remembered the little silver cube with the enigmatic function and he wondered if he should mention it to Kieph. But the euphoriac had not reached that level of his brain, and he remembered his duty to Sue and was silent.</p>
   <p>Kleph shook her head, her eyes upon his warm with - was it sympathy?</p>
   <p>“Believe me,” she said, “you will not find that - important - after all. I promise you, Oliver.”</p>
   <p>He stared at her. “I wish you’d explain.”</p>
   <p>Kleph laughed on a note more sorrowful than amused. But it occurred to Oliver suddenly that there was no longer condescension in her voice. Imperceptibly that air of delicate amusement had vanished from her manner toward him. The cool detachment that still marked Omerie’s attitude, and Klia’s, was not in Kleph’s any more. It was a subtlety he did not think she could assume. It had to come spontaneously or not at all. And for no reason he was willing to examine, it became suddenly very important to Oliver that Kleph should not condescend to him, that she should feel toward him as he felt toward her. He would not think of it.</p>
   <p>He looked down at his cup, rose-quartz, exhaling a thin plume of steam from its crescent-slit opening. This time, he thought, maybe he could make the tea work for him. For he remembered how it loosened the tongue, and there was a great deal he needed to know. The idea that had come to him on the porch in the instant of silent rivalry between Kleph and Sue seemed now too fantastic to entertain. But some answer there must be.</p>
   <p>Kleph herself gave him the opening.</p>
   <p>“I must not take too much euphoriac this afternoon,” she said, smiling at him over her pink cup. “It will make me drowsy, and we are going out this evening with friends.”</p>
   <p>“More friends?” Oliver asked. “From your country?”</p>
   <p>Kieph nodded. “Very dear friends we have expected all this week.”</p>
   <p>“I wish you’d tell me,” Oliver said bluntly, “where it is you come from. It isn’t from here. Your culture is too different from ours - even your names -” He broke off as Kleph shook her head.</p>
   <p>“I wish I could tell you. But that is against all the rules. It is even against the rules for me to be here talking to you now.”</p>
   <p>“What rules?”</p>
   <p>She made a helpless gesture. “You must not ask me, Oliver.” She leaned back on the chaise longue, which adjusted itself luxuriously to the motion, and smiled very sweetly at him. “We must not talk about things like that. Forget it, listen to the music, enjoy yourself if you can -” She closed her eyes and laid her head back against the cushions. Oliver saw the round tanned throat swell as she began to hum a tune. Eyes still closed, she sang again the words she had sung upon the stairs. “Come hider, love, to me -”</p>
   <p>A memory clicked over suddenly in Oliver’s mind. He had never heard the queer, lagging tune before, but he thought he knew the words. He remembered what Hoffia’s husband had said when he heard that line of song, and he leaned forward. She would not answer a direct question, but perhaps - “Was the weather this warm in Canterbury?” he asked, and held his breath. Kleph hummed another line of the song and shook her head, eyes still closed.</p>
   <p>“It was autumn there,” she said. “But bright, wonderfully bright. Even their clothing, you know … everyone was singing that new song, and I can’t get it out of my head.” She sang another line, and the words were almost unintelligible - English, yet not an English Oliver could understand.</p>
   <p>He stood up. “Wait,” he said. “I want to find something. Back in a minute.”</p>
   <p>She opened her eyes and smiled mistily at him, still humming. He went downstairs as fast as he could-the stairway swayed a little, though his head was nearly clear now-and into the library. The book he wanted was old and battered, interlined with the penciled notes of his college days. He did not remember very clearly where the passage he wanted was, but he thumbed fast through the columns and by sheer luck found it within a few minutes. Then he went back upstairs, feeling a strange empthess in his stomach because of what he almost believed now.</p>
   <p>“Kleph,” he said firmly, “I know that song. I know the year it was new.”</p>
   <p>Her lids rose slowly; she looked at him through a mist of euphoriac. He was not sure she had understood. For a long moment she held him with her gaze. Then she put out one downy-sleeved arm and spread her tanned fingers toward him. She laughed deep in her throat.</p>
   <p>“Come hider, love, to me,” she said.</p>
   <p>He crossed the room slowly, took her hand. The fingers closed warmly about his. She pulled him down so that he had to kneel beside her. Her other arm lifted. Again she laughed, very softly, and closed her eyes, lifting her face to his.</p>
   <p>The kiss was warm and long. He caught something of her own euphoria from the fragrance of the tea breathed into his face. And he was startled at the end of the kiss, when the clasp of her arms loosened about his neck, to feel the sudden rush of her breath against his cheek. There were tears on her face, and the sound she made was a sob.</p>
   <p>He held her off and looked down in amazement. She sobbed once more, caught a deep breath, and said, “Oh, Oliver, Oliver -” Then she shook her head and pulled free, turning away to hide her face. “I . .. . I am sorry,” she said unevenly. “Please forgive me. It does not matter… I know it does not matter… but -”</p>
   <p>“What’s wrong? What doesn’t matter?”</p>
   <p>“Nothing. Nothing… please forget it. Nothing at all.” She got a handkerchief from the table and blew her nose, smiling at him with an effect of radiance through the tears.</p>
   <p>Suddenly he was very angry. He had heard enough evasions and mystifying half-truths. He said roughly, “Do you think I’m crazy? I know enough now to -”</p>
   <p>“Oliver, please!” She held up her own cup, steaming fragrantly. “Please, no more questions. Here, euphoria is what you need, Oliver. Euphoria, not answers.”</p>
   <p>“What year was it when you heard that song in Canterbury?” he demanded, pushing the cup aside.</p>
   <p>She blinked at him, tears bright on her lashes. “Why … what year do you think?”</p>
   <p>“I know,” Oliver told her grimly. “I know the year that song was popular. I know you just came from Canterbury - Hoffia’s husband said so. It’s May now, but it was autumn in Canterbury, and you just came from there, so lately the song you heard is still running through your head. Chaucer’s Pardoner sang that song some time around the end of the fourteenth century. Did you see Chaucer, Kleph? What was it like in England that long ago?”</p>
   <p>Kleph’s eyes fixed his for a silent moment. Then her shoulders drooped and her whole body went limp with resignation beneath the soft blue robe. “I am a fool,” she said gently. “It must have been easy to trap me. You really believe - what you say?”</p>
   <p>Oliver nodded.</p>
   <p>She said in a low voice, “Few people do believe it. That is one of our maxims, when we travel. We are safe from much suspicion because people before The Travel began will not believe.”</p>
   <p>The emptiness in Oliver’s stomach suddenly doubled in volume. For an instant the bottom dropped out of time itself and the universe was unsteady about him. He felt sick. He felt naked and helpless. There was a buzzing in his ears and the room dimmed before him.</p>
   <p>He had not really believed - not until this instant. He had expected some rational explanation from her that would tidy all his wild half-thoughts and suspicions into something a man could accept as believable. Not this.</p>
   <p>Kleph dabbed at her eyes with the pale-blue handkerchief and smiled tremulously.</p>
   <p>“I know,” she said. “It must be a terrible thing to accept. To have all your concepts turned upside down - We know it from childhood, of course, but for you … here, Oliver. The euphoriac will make it easier.”</p>
   <p>He took the cup, the faint stain of her lip rouge still on the crescent opening. He drank, feeling the dizzy sweetness spiral through his head, and his brain turned a little in his skull as the volatile fragrance took effect. With that turning, focus shifted and all his values with it.</p>
   <p>He began to feel better. The flesh settled on his bones again, and the warm clothing of temporal assurance settled upon his flesh, and he was no longer naked and in the vortex of unstable time.</p>
   <p>“The story is very simple, really,” Kleph said. “We - travel. Our own time is not terribly far ahead of yours. No. I must not say how far. But we still remember your songs and poets and some of your great actors. We are a people of much leisure, and we cultivate the art of enjoying ourselves.</p>
   <p>“This is a tour we are making - a tour of a year’s seasons. Vintage seasons. That autumn in Canterbury was the most magnificent autumn our researchers could discover anywhere. We rode in a pilgrimage to the shrine - it was a wonderful experience, though the clothing was a little hard to manage.</p>
   <p>“Now this month of May is almost over - the loveliest May in recorded times. A perfect May in a wonderful period. You have no way of knowing what a good, gay period you live in, Oliver. The very feeling in the air of the cities-that wonderful national confidence and happiness - everything going as smoothly as a dream. There were other Mays with fine weather, but each of them had a war or a famine, or something else wrong.” She hesitated, grimaced and went on rapidly. “In a few days we are to meet at a coronation in Rome,” she said. “I think the year will be 800 - Christmastime. We -”</p>
   <p>“But why,” Oliver interrupted, “did you insist on this house? Why do the others want to get it away from you?”</p>
   <p>Kleph stared at him. He saw the tears rising again in small bright crescents that gathered above her lower lids. He saw the look of obstinacy that came upon her soft, tanned face. She shook her head.</p>
   <p>“You must not ask me that.” She held out the steaming cup. “Here, drink and forget what I have said. I can tell you no more. No more at all.”</p>
   <p>When he woke, for a little while he had no idea where he was. He did not remember leaving Kleph or coming to his own room. He didn’t care, just then. For he woke to a sense of overwhelming terror.</p>
   <p>The dark was full of it. His brain rocked on waves of fear and pain. He lay motionless, too frightened to stir, some atavistic memory warning him to lie quiet until he knew from which direction the danger threatened. Reasonless panic broke over him in a tidal flow; his head ached with its violence and the dark throbbed to the same rhythms.</p>
   <p>A knock sounded at the door. Omerie’s deep voice said, ‘Wilson! Wilson, are you awake?”</p>
   <p>Oliver tried twice before he had breath to answer. “Y-yes-what is it?”</p>
   <p>The knob rattled. Omerie’s dim figure groped for the light switch and the room sprang into visibifity. Omerie’s face was drawn with strain, and he held one hand to his head as if it ached in rhythm with Oliver’s.</p>
   <p>It was in that moment, before Omerie spoke again, that Oliver remembered Hoffia’s warning. “Move out, young man-move out before tonight.” Wildly he wondered what threatened them all in this dark house that throbbed with the rhythms of pure terror.</p>
   <p>Omerie in an angry voice answered the unspoken question.</p>
   <p>“Someone has planted a subsonic in the house, Wilson. Kieph thinks you may know where it is.”</p>
   <p>“S-subsonic?”</p>
   <p>“Call it a gadget,” Omerie interpreted impatiently. “Probably a small metal box that -”</p>
   <p>Oliver said, “Oh,” in a tone that must have told Omerie everything.</p>
   <p>“Where is it?” he demanded. “Quick. Let’s get this over.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know.” With an effort Oliver controlled the chattering of his teeth. “Y-you mean all this - all this is just from the little box?”</p>
   <p>“Of course. Now tell me how to find it before we all go crazy.”</p>
   <p>Oliver got shakily out of bed, groping for his robe with nerveless hands. “I s-suppose she hid it somewhere downstairs,” he said. “S-she wasn’t gone long.”</p>
   <p>Omerie got the story out of him in a few brief questions. He clicked his teeth in exasperation when Oliver had finished it.</p>
   <p>“That stupid Hollia -”</p>
   <p>“Omerie!” Kleph’s plaintive voice wailed from the hail. “Please hurry, Omerie! This is too much to stand! Oh, Omerie, please!”</p>
   <p>Oliver stood up abruptly. Then a redoubled wave of the inexplicable pain seemed to explode in his skull at the motion, and he clutched the bedpost and reeled.</p>
   <p>“Go find the thing yourself,” he heard himself saying dizzily. “I can’t even walk -”</p>
   <p>Omerie’s own temper was drawn wire - tight by the pressure in the room. He seized Oliver’s shoulder and shook him, saying in a tight voice, “You let it in - now help us get it out, or -”</p>
   <p>“It’s a gadget out of your world, not mine!” Oliver said furiously.</p>
   <p>And then it seemed to him there was a sudden coldness and silence in the room. Even the pain and the senseless terror paused for a moment. Omerie’s pale, cold eyes fixed upon Oliver a stare so chill he could almost feel the ice in it.</p>
   <p>“What do you know about our world?” Omerie demanded.</p>
   <p>Oliver did not speak a word. He did not need to; his face must have betrayed what he knew. He was beyond concealment in the stress of this night-time terror he still could not understand.</p>
   <p>Omerie bared his white teeth and said three perfectly unintelligible words. Then he stepped to the door and snapped, “Kleph!”</p>
   <p>Oliver could see the two women huddled together in the hall, shaking violently with involuntary waves of that strange, synthetic terror. Kila, in a luminous green gown, was rigid with control, but Kleph made no effort whatever at repression. Her downy robe had turned soft gold tonight; she shivered in it and the tears ran down her face unchecked.</p>
   <p>“Kieph,” Omerie said in a dangerous voice, “you were euphoric again yesterday?”</p>
   <p>Kleph darted a scared glance at Oliver and nodded guiltily.</p>
   <p>“You talked too much.” It was a complete indictment in one sentence. “You know the rules, Kleph. You will not be allowed to travel again if anyone reports this to the authorities.”</p>
   <p>Kleph’s lovely creamy face creased suddenly into impenitent dimples.</p>
   <p>“I know it was wrong. I am very sorry - but you will not stop me if Cenbe says no.”</p>
   <p>Klia flung out her arms in a gesture of helpless anger. Omerie shrugged. “In this case, as it happens, no great harm is done,” he said, giving Oliver an unfathomable glance. “But it might have been serious. Next time perhaps it will be. I must have a talk with Cenbe.”</p>
   <p>“We must find the subsonic first of all,” Klia reminded them, shivering. “If Kleph is afraid to help, she can go out for a while. I confess I am very sick of Kleph’s company just now.”</p>
   <p>“We could give up the house!” Kleph cried wildly. “Let Hoffia have it! How can you stand this long enough to hunt -”</p>
   <p>“Give up the house?” Klia echoed. “You must be mad! With all our invitations out?”</p>
   <p>“There will be no need for that,” Oinerie said. “We can find it if we all hunt. You feel able to help?” He looked at Oliver.</p>
   <p>With an effort Oliver controlled his own senseless panic as the waves of it swept through the room. “Yes,” he said. “But what about me? What are you going to do?”</p>
   <p>“That should be obvious,” Omerie said, his pale eyes in the dark face regarding Oliver impassively. “Keep you in the house until we go. We can certainly do no less. You understand that. And there is no reason for us to do more, as it happens. Silence is all we promised when we signed our travel papers.”</p>
   <p>“But -” Oliver groped for the fallacy in that reasoning. It was no use. He could not think clearly. Panic surged insanely through his mind from the very air around him. “All right,” he said. “Let’s hunt.”</p>
   <p>It was dawn before they found the box, tucked inside the ripped seam of a sofa cushion. Omerie took it upstairs without a word. Five minutes later the pressure in the air abruptly dropped and peace fell blissfully upon the house.</p>
   <p>“They will try again,” Omerie said to Oliver at the door of the back bedroom. “We must watch for that. As for you, I must see that you remain in the house until Friday. For your own comfort, I advise you to let me know if Hoffia offers any further tricks. I confess I am not quite sure how to enforce your staying indoors. I could use methods that would make you very uncomfortable. I would prefer to accept your word on it.”</p>
   <p>Oliver hesitated. The relaxing of pressure upon his brain had left him exhausted and stupid, and he was not at all sure what to say.</p>
   <p>Omerie went on after a moment. “It was partly our fault for not insuring that we had the house to ourselves,” he said. “Living here with us, you could scarcely help suspecting. Shall we say that in return for your promise, I reimburse you in part for losing the sale price on this house?”</p>
   <p>Oliver thought that over. It would pacify Sue a little. And it meant only two days indoors. Besides, what good would escaping do? What could he say to outsiders that would not lead him straight to a padded cell?</p>
   <p>“All right,” he said wearily. “I promise.”</p>
   <p>By Friday morning there was still no sign from Hollia. Sue telephoned at noon. Oliver knew the crackle of her voice over the wire when Kleph took the call. Even the crackle sounded hysterical; Sue saw her bargain slipping hopelessly through her grasping little fingers.</p>
   <p>Kleph’s voice was soothing. “I am sorry,” she said many times, in the intervals when the voice paused. “I am truly sorry. Believe me, you will find it does not matter. I know… I am sorry -”</p>
   <p>She turned from the phone at last. “The girl says Hoffia has given up,” she told the others.</p>
   <p>“Not Hollia,” Klia said firmly.</p>
   <p>Omerie shrugged. “We have very little time left. If she intends anything more, it will be tonight. We must watch for it.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, not tonight!” Kieph’s voice was horrified. “Not even Hoffia would do that!”</p>
   <p>“Hollia, my dear, in her own way is quite as unscrupulous as you are,” Omerie told her with a smile.</p>
   <p>“But - would she spoil things for us just because she can’t be here?”</p>
   <p>“What do you think?” Klia demanded.</p>
   <p>Oliver ceased to listen. There was no making sense out of their talk, but he knew that by tonight whatever the secret was must surely come into the open at last. He was willing to wait and see.</p>
   <p>For two days excitement had been building up in the house and the three who shared it with him. Even the servants felt it and were nervous and unsure of themselves. Oliver had given up asking questions - it only embarrassed his tenants - and watched.</p>
   <p>All the chairs in the house were collected in the three front bedrooms. The furniture was rearranged to make room for them, and dozens of covered cups had been set out on trays. Oliver recognized Kieph’s rose-quartz set among the rest. No steam rose from the thin crescent-openings, but the cups were full. Oliver lifted one and felt a heavy liquid move within it, like something half-solid, sluggishly.</p>
   <p>Guests were obviously expected, but the regular dinner hour of nine came and went, and no one had yet arrived. Dinner was finished; the servants went home. The Sanciscos went to their rooms to dress, amid a feeling of mounting tension.</p>
   <p>Oliver stepped out on the porch after dinner, trying in vain to guess what it was that had wrought such a pitch of expectancy in the house. There was a quarter moon swimming in haze on the horizon, but the stars which had made every night of May thus far a dazzling translucency, were very dim tonight. Clouds had begun to gather at sundown, and the undimmed weather of the whole month seemed ready to break at last.</p>
   <p>Behind Oliver the door opened a little, and closed. He caught Kleph’s fragrance before he turned, and a faint whiff of the fragrance of the euphoriac she was much too fond of drinking. She came to his side and slipped a hand into his, looking up into his face in the darkness.</p>
   <p>“Oliver,” she said very softly. “Promise me one thing. Promise me not to leave the house tonight.”</p>
   <p>“I’ve already promised that,” he said a little irritably.</p>
   <p>“I know. But tonight - I have a very particular reason for wanting you indoors tonight.” She leaned her head against his shoulder for a moment, and despite himself his irritation softened. He had not seen Kleph alone since that last night of her revelations; he supposed he never would be alone with her again for more than a few minutes at a time. But he knew he would not forget those two bewildering evenings. He knew too, now, that she was very weak and foolish - but she was still Kleph and he had held her in his arms, and was not likely ever to forget it.</p>
   <p>“You might be - hurt - if you went out tonight,” she was saying in a muffled voice. “I know it will not matter, in the end, but - remember you promised, Oliver.”</p>
   <p>She was gone again, and the door had closed behind her, before he could voice the futile questions in his mind.</p>
   <p>The guests began to arrive just before midnight. From the head of the stairs Oliver saw them coming in by twos and threes, and was astonished at how many of these people from the future must have gathered here in the past weeks. He could see quite clearly now how they differed from the norm of his own period. Their physical elegance was what one noticed first-perfect grooming, meticulous manners, meticulously controlled voices. But because they were all idle, all, in a way, sensation-hunters, there was a certain shrillness underlying their voices, especially when heard all together. Petulance and self-indulgence showed beneath the good manners. And tonight, an all-pervasive excitement.</p>
   <p>By one o’clock everyone had gathered in the front rooms. The teacups had begun to steam, apparently of themselves, around midnight, and the house was full of the faint, thin fragrance that induced a sort of euphoria all through the rooms, breathed in with the perfume of the tea.</p>
   <p>It made Oliver feel light and drowsy. He was determined to sit up as long as the others did, but he must have dozed off in his own room, by the window, an unopened book in his lap.</p>
   <p>For when it happened he was not sure for a few minutes whether or not it was a dream.</p>
   <p>The vast, incredible crash was louder than sound. He felt the whole house shake under him, felt rather than heard the timbers grind upon one another like broken bones, while he was still in the borderland of sleep. When he woke fully he was on the floor among the shattered fragments of the window.</p>
   <p>How long or short a time he had lain there he did not know. The world was still stunned with that tremendous noise, or his ears still deaf from it, for there was no sound anywhere.</p>
   <p>He was halfway down the hail toward the front rooms when sound began to return from outside. It was a low, indescribable rumble at first, prickled with countless tiny distant screams. Oliver’s eardrums ached from the terrible impact of the vast unheard noise, but the numbness was wearing off and he heard before he saw it the first voices of the stricken city.</p>
   <p>The door to Kleph’s room resisted him for a moment. The house had settled a little from the violence of the-the explosion?-and the frame was out of line. When he got the door open he could only stand blinking stupidly into the darkness within. All the lights were out, but there was a breathless sort of whispering going on in many voices.</p>
   <p>The chairs were drawn around the broad front windows so that everyone could see out; the air swam with the fragrance of euphoria. There was light enough here from outside for Oliver to see that a few onlookers still had their hands to their ears, but all were craning eagerly forward to see.</p>
   <p>Through a dreamlike haze Oliver saw the city spread out with impossible distinctness below the window. He knew quite well that a row of houses across the street blocked the view - yet he was looking over the city now, and he could see it in a limitless panorama from here to the horizon. The houses between had vanished.</p>
   <p>On the far skyline fire was already a solid mass, painting the low clouds crimson. That sulphurous light reflecting back from the sky upon the city made clear the rows upon rows of flattened houses with flame beginning to lick up among them, and farther out the formless rubble of what had been houses a few minutes ago and was now nothing at all.</p>
   <p>The city had begun to be vocal. The noise of the flames rose loudest, but you could hear a rumble of human voices like the beat of surf a long way off, and staccato noises of screaming made a sort of pattern that came and went continuously through the web of sound. Threading it in undulating waves the shrieks of sirens knit the web together into a terrible symphony that had, in its way, a strange, inhuman beauty.</p>
   <p>Briefly through Oliver’s stunned incredulity went the memory of that other symphony Kleph had played there one day, another catastrophe retold in terms of music and moving shapes.</p>
   <p>He said hoarsely, “Kieph -”</p>
   <p>The tableau by the window broke. Every head turned, and Oliver saw the faces of strangers staring at him, some few in embarrassment avoiding his eyes, but most seeking them out with that avid, inhuman curiosity which is common to a type in all crowds at accident scenes. But these people were here by design, audience at a vast disaster timed almost for their coming.</p>
   <p>Kleph got up unsteadily, her velvet dinner gown tripping her as she rose. She set down a cup and swayed a little as she came toward the door, saying, “Oliver … Oliver -” in a sweet, uncertain voice. She was drunk, he saw, and wrought up by the catastrophe to a pitch of stimulation in which she was not very sure what she was doing.</p>
   <p>Oliver heard himself saying in a thin voice not his own, “W-what was it, Kleph? What happened? What -” But happened seemed so inadequate a word for the incredible panorama below that he had to choke back hysterical laughter upon the struggling questions, and broke off entirely, trying to control the shaking that had seized his body.</p>
   <p>Kleph made an unsteady stoop and seized a steaming cup. She came to him, swaying, holding it out -her panacea for all ills.</p>
   <p>“Here, drink it, Oliver - we are all quite safe here, quite safe.” She thrust the cup to his lips and he gulped automatically, grateful for the fumes that began their slow, coiling surcease in his brain with the first swallow.</p>
   <p>“It was a meteor,” Kleph was saying. “Quite a small meteor, really. We are perfectly safe here. This house was never touched.”</p>
   <p>Out of some cell of the unconscious Oliver heard himself saying incoherently, “Sue? Is Sue -” he could not finish.</p>
   <p>Kleph thrust the cup at him again. “I think she may be safe - for awhile. Please, Oliver - forget about all that and drink.”</p>
   <p>“But you knew!” Realization of that came belatedly to his stunned brain. “You could have given warning, or -”</p>
   <p>“How could we change the past?” Kieph asked. “We knew - but could we stop the meteor? Or warn the city? Before we come we must give our word never to interfere -”</p>
   <p>Their voices had risen imperceptibly to be audible above the rising volume of sound from below. The city was roaring now, with flames and cries and the crash of failing buildings. Light in the room turned lurid and pulsed upon the walls and ceiling in red light and redder dark.</p>
   <p>Downstairs a door slammed. Someone laughed. It was high, hoarse, angry laughter. Then from the crowd in the room someone gasped and there was a chorus of dismayed cries. Oliver tried to focus upon the window and the terrible panorama beyond, and found he could not.</p>
   <p>It took several seconds of determined blinking to prove that more than his own vision was at fault. Kleph whimpered softly and moved against him. His arms closed about her automatically, and he was grateful for the warm, solid flesh against him. This much at least he could touch and be sure of, though everything else that was happening might be a dream. Her perfume and the heady perfume of the tea rose together in his head, and for an instant, holding her in this embrace that must certainly be the last time he ever held her, he did not care that something had gone terribly wrong with the very air of the room.</p>
   <p>It was blindness - not continuous, but a series of swift, widening ripples between which he could catch glimpses of the other faces in the room, strained and astonished in the flickering light from the city.</p>
   <p>The ripples came faster. There was only a blink of sight between them now, and the blinks grew briefer and briefer, the intervals of darkness more broad.</p>
   <p>From downstairs the laughter rose again up the stairwell. Oliver thought he knew the voice. He opened his mouth to speak, but a door nearby slammed open before he could find his tongue, and Omerie shouted down the stairs.</p>
   <p>“Hollia?” he roared above the roaring of the city. “Hollia, is that you?”</p>
   <p>She laughed again, triumphantly. “I warned you!” her hoarse, harsh voice called. “Now come out in the street with the rest of us if you want to see any more!”</p>
   <p>“Hoffia!” Omerie shouted desperately. “Stop this or -”</p>
   <p>The laughter was derisive. “What will you do, Omerie? This time I hid it too well - come down in the street if you want to watch the rest.”</p>
   <p>There was angry silence in the house. Oliver could feel Kieph’s quick, excited breathing light upon his cheek, feel the soft motions of her body in his arms. He tried consciously to make the moment last, stretch it out to infinity. Everything had happened too swiftly to impress very clearly on his mind anything except what he could touch and hold. He held her in an embrace made consciously light, though he wanted to clasp her in a tight, despairing grip, because he was sure this was the last embrace they would ever share.</p>
   <p>The eye-straining blinks of light and blindness went on. From far away below the roar of the burning city rolled on, threaded together by the long, looped cadences of the sirens that linked all sounds into one.</p>
   <p>Then in the bewildering dark another voice sounded from the hall downstairs. A man’s voice, very deep, very melodious, saying:</p>
   <p>“What is this? What are you doing here? Hollia - is that you?”</p>
   <p>Oliver felt Kieph stiffen in his arms. She caught her breath, but she said nothing in the instant while heavy feet began to mount the stairs, coming up with a solid, confident tread that shook the old house to each step.</p>
   <p>Then Kleph thrust herself hard out of Oliver’s arms. He heard her high, sweet, excited voice crying, “Cenbe! Cenbe!” and she ran to meet the newcomer through the waves of dark and light that swept the shaken house.</p>
   <p>Oliver staggered a little and felt a chair seat catching the back of his legs. He sank into it and lifted to his lips the cup he still held. Its steam was warm and moist in his face, though he could scarcely make out the shape of the rim.</p>
   <p>He lifted it with both hands and drank.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>When he opened his eyes it was quite dark in the room. Also it was silent except for a thin, melodious humming almost below the threshold of sound. Oliver struggled with the memory of a monstrous nightmare. He put it resolutely out of his mind and sat up, feeling an unfamifiar bed creak and sway under him.</p>
   <p>This was Kleph’s room. But no - Kleph’s no longer. Her shining hangings were gone from the walls, her white resilient rug, her pictures. The room looked as it had looked before she came, except for one thing.</p>
   <p>In the far corner was a table - a block of translucent stuff - out of which light poured softly. A man sat on a low stool before it, leaning forward, his heavy shoulders outlined against the glow. He wore earphones and he was making quick, erratic notes upon a pad on his knee, swaying a little as if to the tune of unheard music.</p>
   <p>The curtains were drawn, but from beyond them came a distant, muffled roaring that Oliver remembered from his nightmare. He put a hand to his face, aware of a feverish warmth and a dipping of the room before his eyes. His head ached, and there was a deep malaise in every limb and nerve.</p>
   <p>As the bed creaked, the man in the corner turned, sliding the earphones down like a collar. He had a strong, sensitive face above a dark beard, trimmed short. Oliver had never seen him before, but he had that air Oliver knew so well by now, of remoteness which was the knowledge of time itself lying like a gulf between them.</p>
   <p>When he spoke his deep voice was impersonally kind.</p>
   <p>“You had too much euphoriac, Wilson,” he said, aloofly sympathetic. “You slept a long while.”</p>
   <p>“How long?” Oliver’s throat felt sticky when he spoke.</p>
   <p>The man did not answer. Oliver shook his head experimentally. He said, “I thought Kleph said you don’t get hangovers from -” Then another thought interrupted the first, and he said quickly, “Where is Kleph?” He looked confusedly toward the door.</p>
   <p>“They should be in Rome by now. Watching Charlemagne’s coronation at St. Peter’s on Christmas Day a thousand years from here.”</p>
   <p>That was not a thought Oliver could grasp clearly. His aching brain sheered away from it; he found thinking at all was strangely difficult. Staring at the man, he traced an idea painfully to its conclusion.</p>
   <p>“So they’ve gone on - but you stayed behind? Why? You, you’re Cenbe? I heard your - symphonia, Kieph called it.”</p>
   <p>“You heard part of it. I have not finished yet. I needed - this.” Cenbe inclined his head toward the curtains beyond which the subdued roaring still went on.</p>
   <p>“You needed - the meteor?” The knowledge worked painfully through his dulled brain until it seemed to strike some area still untouched by the aching, an area still alive to implication. “The meteor? But -”</p>
   <p>There was a power implicit in Cenbe’s raised hand that seemed to push Oliver down upon the bed again. Cenbe said patiently, “The worst of it is past now, for a while. Forget if you can. That was days ago. I said you were asleep for some time. I let you rest. I knew this house would be safe - from the fire at least.”</p>
   <p>“Then - something more’s to come?” Oliver only mumbled his question. He was not sure he wanted an answer. He had been curious so long, and now that knowledge lay almost within reach, something about his brain seemed to refuse to listen. Perhaps this weariness, this feverish, dizzy feeling would pass as the effect of the euphoriac wore off.</p>
   <p>Cenbe’s voice ran on smoothly, soothingly, almost as if Cenbe too did not want him to think. It was easiest to lie here and listen.</p>
   <p>“I am a composer,” Cenbe was saying. “I happen to be interested in interpreting certain forms of disaster into my own terms. That is why I stayed on. The others were dilettantes. They came for the May weather and the spectacle. The aftermath - well why should they wait for that? As for myself - I suppose I am a connoisseur. I find the aftermath rather fascinating. And I need it. I need to study it at first hand, for my own purposes.”</p>
   <p>His eyes dwelt upon Oliver for an instant very keenly, like a physician’s eyes, impersonal and observing. Absently he reached for his stylus and the note pad. And as he moved, Oliver saw a familiar mark on the underside of the thick, tanned wrist.</p>
   <p>“Kieph had that scar, too,” he heard himself whisper. “And the others.”</p>
   <p>Cenbe nodded. “Inoculation. It was necessary, under the circumstances. We did not want disease to spread in our own time-world.”</p>
   <p>“Disease?”</p>
   <p>Cenbe shrugged. “You would not recognize the name.”</p>
   <p>“But, if you can inoculate against disease -” Oliver thrust himself up on an aching arm. He had a half-grasp upon a thought now which he did not want to let go. Effort seemed to make the ideas come more clearly through his mounting confusion. With enormous effort he went on.</p>
   <p>“I’m getting it now,” he said. “Wait. I’ve been trying to work this out. You can change history? You can! I know you can. Kieph said she had to promise not to interfere. You all had to promise. Does that mean you really could change your own past-our time?”</p>
   <p>Cenbe laid down his pad again. He looked at Oliver thoughtfully, a dark, intent look under heavy brows. “Yes,” he said. “Yes, the past can be changed, but not easily. And it changes the future, too, necessarily. The lines of probability are switched into new patterns - but it is extremely difficult, and it has never been allowed. The physiotemporal course tends to slide back to its norm, always. That is why it is so hard to force any alteration.” He shrugged. “A theoretical science. We do not change history, Wilson. If we changed our past, our present would be altered, too. And our time - world is entirely to our liking. There may be a few malcontents there, but they are not allowed the privilege of temporal travel.”</p>
   <p>Oliver spoke louder against the roaring from beyond the windows. “But you’ve got the power! You could alter history, if you wanted to - wipe out all the pain and suffering and tragedy -”</p>
   <p>“All of that passed away long ago,” Cenbe said.</p>
   <p>“Not - now! Not - this!”</p>
   <p>Cenbe looked at him enigmatically for a while. Then -“This, too,” he said.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>And suddenly Oliver realized from across what distances Cenbe was watching him. A vast distance, as time is measured. Cenbe was a composer and a genius, and necessarily strongly empathic, but his psychic locus was very far away in time. The dying city outside, the whole world of now was not quite real to Cenbe, falling short of reality because of that basic variance in time. It was merely one of the building blocks that had gone to support the edifice on which Cenbe’s culture stood in a misty, unknown, terrible future.</p>
   <p>It seemed terrible to Oliver now. Even Kleph - all of them had been touched with a pettiness, the faculty that had enabled Hoffia to concentrate on her malicious, small schemes to acquire a ringside seat while the meteor thundered in toward Earth’s atmosphere. They were all dilettantes, Kleph and Omerie and the other. They toured time, but only as onlookers. Were they bored - sated - with their normal existence?</p>
   <p>Not sated enough to wish change, basically. Their own time - world was a fulfilled womb, a perfection made manifest for their needs. They dared not change the past-they could not risk flawing their own present.</p>
   <p>Revulsion shook him. Remembering the touch of Kleph’s lips, he felt a sour sickness on his tongue. Alluring she had been; he knew that too well. But the aftermath-There was something about this race from the future. He had felt it dimly at first, before Kleph’s nearness had drowned caution and buffered his sensibilities. Time traveling ‘purely as an escape mechanism seemed almost blasphemous. A race with such power - Kleph - leaving him for the barbaric, splendid coronation at Rome a thousand years ago - how had she seen him? Not as a living, breathing man. He knew that, very certainly. Kleph’s race were spectators.</p>
   <p>But he read more than casual interest in Cenbe’s eyes now. There was an avidity there, a bright, fascinated probing. The man had replaced his earphones - he was different from the others. He was a connoisseur. After the vintage season came the aftermath - and Cenbe.</p>
   <p>Cenbe watched and waited, light flickering softly in the translucent block before him, his fingers poised over the note pad. The ultimate connoisseur waited to savor the rarities that no non-gourmet could appreciate.</p>
   <p>Those thin, distant rhythms of sound that was almost music began to be audible again above the noises of the distant fire. Listening, remembering, Oliver could very nearly catch the pattern of the symphonia as he had heard it, all intermingled with the flash of changing faces and the rank upon rank of the dying-He lay back on the bed letting the room swirl away into the darkness behind his closed and aching lids. The ache was implicit in every cell of his body, almost a second ego taking possession and driving him out of himself, a strong, sure ego taking over as he himself let go.</p>
   <p>Why, he wondered dully, should Kieph have lied? She had said there was no aftermath to the drink she had given him. No aftermath - and yet this painful possession was strong enough to edge him out of his own body.</p>
   <p>Kleph had not lied. It was no aftermath to drink. He knew that - but the knowledge no longer touched his brain or his body. He lay still, giving them up to the power of the illness which was aftermath to something far stronger than the strongest drink. The illness that had no name - yet.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Cenbe’s new symphonia was a crowning triumph. It had its premiere from Antares Hall, and the applause was an ovation. History itself, of course, was the artist-opening with the meteor that forecast the great plagues of the fourteenth century and closing with the climax Cenbe had caught on the threshold of modem times. But only Cenbe could have interpreted it with such subtle power.</p>
   <p>Critics spoke of the masterly way in which he had chosen the face of the Stuart king as a recurrent motif against the montage of emotion and sound and movement. But there were other faces, fading through the great sweep of the composition, which helped to build up to the tremendous climax. One face in particular, one moment that the audience absorbed greedily. A moment in which one man’s face loomed huge in the screen, every feature clear. Cenbe had never caught an emotional crisis so effectively, the critics agreed. You could almost read the man’s eyes.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>After Cenbe had left, he lay motionless for a long while. He was thinking feverishly-I’ve got to find some way to tell people. If I’d known in advance, maybe something could have been done. We’d have forced them to tell us how to change the probabilities. We could have evacuated the city.</p>
   <p>If I could leave a message - Maybe not for today’s people. But later. They visit all through time.</p>
   <p>If they could be recognized and caught somewhere, sometime, and made to change destiny - It wasn’t easy to stand up. The room kept tilting. But he managed it. He found pencil and paper and through the swaying of the shadows he wrote down what he could. Enough. Enough to warn, enough to save.</p>
   <p>He put the sheets on the table, in plain sight, and weighted them down before he stumbled back to bed through closing darkness.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The house was dynamited six days later, part of the futile attempt to halt the relentless spread of the Blue Death.</p>
