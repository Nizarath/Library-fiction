     <p>1. ENCOUNTER IN RIO</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>The whole thing never happened and I can prove it -- now. But Ira De Kalb made me wait a billion years to write the story.</p>
    <p>So we start with a paradox. But the strangest thing of all is that there are no real paradoxes involved, not one. This is a record of logic. Not human logic, of course, not the logic of this time or this space.</p>
    <p>I don't know if men will ever journey again, as we journeyed, to that intersection of latitude and longitude where a shell hangs forever -- forever and yet not forever, in space and out of space -- on the axis stretching through time from beginning to end.</p>
    <p>From the dawn of the nebulae to the twilight of absolute entropy, when the framework of the cosmos has broken down into chaos, still that axis will stretch from dawn to dusk, from beginning to end. For as this world spins on an axis through space, so the sphere of time spins on its own axis.</p>
    <p>I never understood the ultimate answer. That was beyond me. It took the combined skills of three great civilizations far apart in time to frame that godlike concept in which the tangible universe itself was only a single factor.</p>
    <p>And even then it was not enough. It took the Face of Ea -- which I shall never be able to describe fully.</p>
    <p>I saw it, though. I saw it, luminous in the reddish dusk, speaking to me silently above the winds that scour perpetually across the dead, empty lands of a day yet to come. I think it will stand there forever in an empty land on a dead planet, watching the endless night draw slowly on through days as long as years. The stars will stand and the Earth-nekropoh's will stand and the Face will stand there forever. I was there. I saw it.</p>
    <p>Was there? Will be? Maybe? I can't tell now. But of all stories in the world, this more than any needs a pattern.</p>
    <p>Since the beginning is in the past, before men as such existed at all, the only starting place I know is a temporal and personal one, when I was drawn into the experiment. Now that I know a little more about the nature of time it seems clearer to me that past, present and future were all stepping stones, arranged out of sequence. The first step took place two months ago.</p>
    <p>That was here in this time and space. Or in the time and space that existed two months ago. There's been a change.</p>
    <p>Now this is the way it used to be.</p>
    <p>For me, the Big Ride. You start when you're born. You climb on the toboggan and then you're off. But you can only have the one ride. No use telling the ticket-taker you want to go again. They shovel you under at the end of the slope and there's a new lot of passengers waiting. You've had your three-score and ten. And it's over.</p>
    <p>I'd ridden the toboggan for thirty-five years. Jeremy Cortland, Jerry Cortland of the Denver Post, the Frisco Call-Bulletin, PM, AP, Time, Collzers -- sometimes staff, sometimes roving assignments. I leaned out of the toboggan and plucked fruit from the orchards as I sped by. Strange fruit, sometimes. Generic term is News. And that covers a lot of territory.</p>
    <p>There was a splinter in the toboggan's seat. I had on red flannel underwear. I had a nervous tic. I couldn't sit still. I kept reaching out, grabbing. Years of it, of by-lines that said "cabled by Jeremy Cortland."</p>
    <p>Russia, China, war coverage, Piccard's bathyscaphe, the supersonic and altostratosphere planes, the Russian earth-borer gadget, the Big Eye at Palomar -- the coal strikes and the cracker lynchings and that dirt farmer in North Dakota who suddenly began to work miracles. (His patients didn't stay cured, you remember, and he disappeared.)</p>
    <p>The Big Ride. In between I grabbed at other things. One marriage, one divorce, and more and more bulges. Long bouts, between assignments. I didn't give a -- well, you can't use that word in some papers. But it was all right. What did I expect, heaven?</p>
    <p>The eyes aren't quite as clear as they used to be. The skin under them is a little puffy. One chin begins to be not quite enough. But it's still the Big Ride. With a splinter in the seat.</p>
    <p>Dodging alimony payments, I skipped to Brazil, got in on a submarine exploration of the Amazon, wrote it up, sold it to AP as a feature. The first installment appeared on the same day as another little item -- buried in the back -- that said 85 and 87 had been made artificially.</p>
    <p>Astatine and francium -- the missing link in the periodic table -- two billion years ago you could have picked up all the astatine and francium you wanted, just by reaching down and grabbing. If you'd been around at the time. Since then 85 and 87 have decayed into other elements. But Seaborg and Ghiorso at UC made them synthetically, with the big cyclotron and atomic oven transmutation, and the column on one side of that trivial item said SECOND BURN-DEATH VICTIM FOUND, and on the other there was a crossword puzzle.</p>
    <p>I didn't care, either.</p>
    <p>Those deaths, by an indefinable sort of burning, were just starting to confound the United States authorities at the time. They hadn't yet spread to South America.</p>
    <p>There was another item in that same ParAr that concerned me though I didn't know it at the time seemed that Ira De Kalb was working with Military Intelligence on some sort of highly secret project -- so secret you could read all about it as far south as Rio if you had the price of the paper.</p>
    <p>I had my own current problem. And it was a very odd one.</p>
    <p>The thing started six weeks before it began. You'll have to get used to paradox -- which isn't paradox once you grasp the idea.</p>
    <p>It started in an alley in Rio, a little cobbled tunnel opening off the Rua d'Ouvidor, and what I was doing there at three o'clock of a summer morning in January I'll never be able to tell you. I'd been drinking. Also I'd been playing chemin de fer and there was a thick pad of banknotes in the inside pocket of my white jacket, another stuffed into the dark wine-colored cummerbund I was wearing.</p>
    <p>Looking down, I could see the toes of my shoes twinkling in the moonlight as I walked. The sky twinkled too, and the lights up in the hills and out on the bay. The world was a shiny place, revolving gently around me.</p>
    <p>I was rich. But this time it was going to last. This time I'd cut out the binges and take a little house up in Petropolis, where it's cool, and I'd really get down to work on the analysis of news-coverage I'd been planning for so long. I'd made up my mind. I was drunk but I'd be sober again and the resolution would stay behind when the liquor died.</p>
    <p>I don't often get these fits of decision but when they come they're valid enough and I knew this one was serious. That was a turning point in the career of Jerry Cortland, there in the moonlight on the checkered pavement.</p>
    <p>What happened at the mouth of that alley I'll never really know. Fortunately for me I couldn't see or realize it clearly, being drunk.</p>
    <p>It sprang from the deep shadow and put out two arms at me. That much I'm sure of. Two arms that never touched me. They never meant to. They shot past my ears, and I heard a thin hissing noise and something seemed to turn over in my mind, leisurely, like a deep-buried thought stirring to life. I could all but feel it move.</p>
    <p>I touched it.</p>
    <p>I wish I hadn't. But I was thinking of my money. My hand closed on the thing -- on a part of it -- no one will ever know on just what. I will only tell you it was smooth with a smoothness that burned my hand. Friction burned it, I think now. The sheer velocity of the thing, though it was not then moving perceptibly, took a neat thin layer of cuticle off my palm wherever it touched. I think it slid out of my grip on a thin lubrication of my own skin.</p>
    <p>You know how it is when you touch something white-hot? For an instant it may feel cold. I didn't know I was burned. I closed my hand hard on the -- on whatever it was I had hold of. And the very pressure of the grip seemed to push it away, out of my hand, very smooth and fast. All I know is that a moment later I stood there, shaking my band because it stung and watching something dark in the moonlight vanish down the street with a motion that frightened me.</p>
    <p>I was too dazed to shout. By the time my wits came back it had disappeared and the feeling of unreality it left behind made me doubt whether I had ever seen or felt it at all.</p>
    <p>About ten minutes later I found my money was gone. So it wasn't a turning point in my life, after all. If things had worked out any differently I never would have met Ira De Kalb. I never would have got myself mixed up in that series of deaths which so far as I was concerned were only signposts pointing the way to De Kalb. Maybe it was a turning point, at that.</p>
    <p>The mind as well as the senses can be awfully slow sometimes. The hand doesn't know it has been burned, the mind can't recognize the impossible when it confronts it. There are many little refuges for a mind that must not admit to itself the impossible has happened.</p>
    <p>I went back to my hotel that night and got into bed. I had met a thief, I told myself drowsily, as I'd deserved -- walking a city street that late at night, loaded down with cash. I had it coming. He'd got my money and that was that. (He -- it -- hadn't touched the money, or me, except in that one brief unbalanced instant. The thing was impossible. But since it had happened, then it was possible and the mind could dismiss it.) I went to sleep.</p>
    <p>And woke at dawn to the most extraordinary experience I'd ever had in my life, up to then. Even that encounter on the Rua d'Ouvidor hadn't been like this.</p>
    <p>The experience was pure sensation. And the sensation was somewhere inside me, vaguely in the solar plexus region -- a soundless explosion of pure energy like a dazzling sun coming into sudden, radiant being. There aren't any accurate words to tell about it.</p>
    <p>But I was aware of ring after ring of glowing vitality bursting outward from that nova in the deepest nerve-center of my body. For a timeless instant I lay there, bathed in it, feeling it pour like a new kind of blood through my veins. In that instant I knew what it was.</p>
    <p>Then somebody turned off the power at its source.</p>
    <p>I sat up abruptly, empty of the radiance, empty as if it had never happened, but filled terribly with the knowledge of what had caused it.</p>
    <p>My head ached from the sudden motion. Dawn made the sky light outside and brimmed the room with a clear gray luminous pallor. I sat there holding my head in both hands and knowing -- knowing -- that somewhere in the city an instant ago a man had been killed.</p>
    <p>There was no shadow of doubt in my mind. I was as sure as if I had had that strange sensation a hundred times before and each time seen a man die as it burst into a nova-glow inside me.</p>
    <p>I wanted to go back to sleep and pretend it had been a dream. But I knew I couldn't. I dragged myself out of bed and into my clothes. I took my aching head and jangled nerves down into the street and found a yawning taxi-driver.</p>
    <p>You see, I even knew where the dead man would be found. It was unthinkable that I should go there looking for him -- but I went. And I found him. He was lying huddled against the rim of a fountain in a little square not far from the place where I'd last seen my -- my thief -- of the night before vanishing with that disquieting, smooth swiftness in the moonlight.</p>
    <p>The dead man was an Indian, probably a beggar. I stood there in the deserted square, looking down at him, hearing the early morning traffic moving noisily past, knowing someone would find us here together at any moment. I had never seen a victim of the burn-death before but I knew I looked at one now. It wasn't a real burn, properly speaking. Friction, I though, had done it. The eroded skin made me think of something, and I looked at my own palm.</p>
    <p>I was standing there, staring from my burned hand to the dead man and then back again, when -- it happened again.</p>
    <p>The bursting nova of pure radiance flared into, violence somewhere near the pit of my stomach. Vitality poured through my veins ...</p>
    <p>I sold the series to AP as usual. There had been five of the murders in Rio before I got my idea about putting an end to them and by then the stories had begun to hit the States papers, some of them running my picture along with the sensational stuff about the deaths, and my uncanny ability at locating the bodies.</p>
    <p>Looking back now, I suppose the only reason they didn't arrest me for murder was that they couldn't figure out how I'd done it. Luckily my hand had healed before the police and the papers began to connect me so tightly with the deaths.</p>
    <p>After the fifth murder I got a reservation for New York. I had come to the conclusion that if I left Rio the murders would stop -- in Rio. I thought they might begin again in New York. I had to find out, you see. By then I was in pretty bad shape, for the best of reasons -- or the worst. Anyhow, I went back.</p>

     <p>2. THE STAIN AND THE STONE</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>There was a message waiting for me at the airport. Robert J. Allister wanted to see me. I felt impressed. Allister runs a chain of news and picture magazines second only to Life and Time.</p>
    <p>I phoned for an appointment, and they told me to come right up. I walked through a waiting-room full of people with prior appointments and they passed me right into the sanctum, with no preliminaries. I began to wonder if I'd been underestimating my own importance all these years. Allister himself rose behind his desk and offered me his hand. I waded forward, ankle-deep through Persian carpets, and took it. He told me to sit down. His voice was tired and he looked thinner and more haggard than his pictures.</p>
    <p>"So you're Jerry Cortland," he said. "Been following your Rio stuff. Nice work. Care to drop it for awhile?" I gaped. He gave me a tired grin.</p>
    <p>"I'd like you to work for me on contract," he said. "Let me explain. You know Ira De Kalb?"</p>
    <p>"The poor man's Einstein?"</p>
    <p>"In a way, maybe. He's a dilettante. He's a genius, really, I suppose. A mind like a grasshopper. He'll work out a whole new concept of mathematics and never bother to apply it. He -- well, you'll understand better after you've met him. He's onto something very new, just now. Something very important. I want some pieces written on it and De Kalb made a point of asking for you."</p>
    <p>"But why?"</p>
    <p>"He has his reasons. He'll explain to you -- maybe. I can't." He pushed the contract toward me. "How about it?"</p>
    <p>"Well -- " I hesitated. My ex-wife had just slapped another summons on me, alimony again, and I could certainly use some money. "I'll try it," I said. "But I'm irresponsible. Maybe I won't stick to it."</p>
    <p>"You'll stick," Allister said grimly, "once you've talked to De Kalb. That I can guarantee. Sign here."</p>
    <p>De Kalb's house blended into the hillside as if Frank Lloyd Wright had built it with his own hands. I was out of breath by the time I got to the top of the gray stone terraces linked together by gray stone steps. A maid let me in and showed me to a room where I could wait.</p>
    <p>"Mr. De Kalb is expecting you," she said. "He'll be back in about ten minutes."</p>
    <p>Half the room was glass, looking out upon miles and miles of Appalachians, tumbled brown and green, with a dazzling sky above. There was somebody already there, apparently waiting too. I saw the outlines of a woman's spare, straight figure rising almost apologetically from a desk as I entered. I knew her by that air of faint apology no less than by her outline against the light.</p>
    <p>"Dr. Essen!" I said. And I was aware then of my first feeling of respect for this job, whatever it was. You don't get two people like Letta Essen and Ira De Kalb under the same roof for anything trivial.</p>
    <p>I knew Dr. Essen. I'd interviewed her twice, right after Hiroshima, about the work she'd done with Meitner and Frisch in establishing the nuclear liquid-drop concept of atomic fission. I wanted very much to ask her what she was doing here but I didn't. I knew I'd get more out of her if I let it come her way.</p>
    <p>"Mr. De Kalb asked me to meet you, Mr. Cortland," she said in her pleasant soft voice. "Hello, it's nice to see you again. You've been having quite a time in Rio, haven't you?"</p>
    <p>"Old stuff now," I said. "This looks promising, if you're in on it. What's up, anyhow?"</p>
    <p>She gave me that shy smile again. She had a tired gentle face, gray curls cut very short, gray eyes like two flashes of light off a steel beam when she let you meet her direct gaze. Mostly she was too shy. But when you caught that rare quick glance of her it was almost frightening. You realized then the hard dazzling mind behind the eyes.</p>
    <p>"I'll let Mr. De Kalb tell you all about that," she said. "It isn't my secret. But you're involved more than you know. In fact -- " She paused, not looking at me, but giving the corner of the carpet a gentle scowl. "In fact, I'd like to show you something. We've got a little time to spare, and I want your reaction to -- to something. Come with me and we'll see."</p>
    <p>I followed her out into the hall, down a flight of steps and then into a big room, comfortably furnished. A study, I thought. But the bookshelves were empty now and everything was lightly filmed with dust.</p>
    <p>"The fireplace, Mr. Cortland," Dr. Essen said, pointing.</p>
    <p>It was an ordinary fireplace, gray stone in the pine-paneled wall, with a gray stone hearth. But there seemed to be a stain at one spot on the hearth, close to the wall. I stepped closer. Then I knelt to look.</p>
    <p>The speed of a chain of thoughts comes as close as anything I know to annihilating time itself. The images that flashed through my mind seemed to come all at once.</p>
    <p>I saw the stain. I thought -- transmutation. There was no overt reason but I thought it. And then before I could take it in clearly with my conscious mind, in the chambers of the unconscious I was standing again at the alley mouth in Rio at three in the morning, seeing a dark thing leap forward at me with its two hands outstretched.</p>
    <p>I heard the thin humming in my ears, felt the burning of its touch. I remembered the sunburst of violent energy deep inside me that had heralded murder whenever it came. And I knew that all these were one -- all these and the stain upon the hearth. The knowledge came unbidden, without reason.</p>
    <p>But it was sure.</p>
    <p>I didn't question it. But I looked very closely at the stone. That stain was an irregular area where the stone seemed changed into another substance. I didn't know what the substance was. It looked wholly unfamiliar. The gray of the hearth stopped abruptly, along an irregular pattern, and gave place to a substance that seemed translucent, shot through with veins and striae that were lighter, like the veins in marble.</p>
    <p>The pine panels beside the fireplace were partly stained like the stone and a little area of the carpet that came up to the edge of the hearth. Wood, stone and cloth alike had turned into this -- this marble stain. The veins in it were like tangled hair, curling together, embedded like some strange neural structure in half transparent flesh.</p>
    <p>I looked up.</p>
    <p>"Don't touch it," Dr. Essen said quickly.</p>
    <p>I didn't mean to. I didn't need to. I knew what it would feel like. I knew that though it was perfectly motionless it would burn my hand with friction if I touched it. Dr. Essen knew too. I saw that in her face.</p>
    <p>I stood up. "What is it?" I asked, my voice sounding oddly thin.</p>
    <p>"The nekron," she told me, almost absently. She was searching my face and the keenness of her gaze was al- most painful to meet. "That's Mr. De Kalb's word for it. As good a word as any. It's -- a new type of matter. Mr. Cortland -- you have seen something like this before?" Her rare, direct look was like the sharpness of a knife going through me, cold and deep.</p>
    <p>"Maybe," I said. "No, never, really. But -- "</p>
    <p>"All right, I understand," she nodded. "I wanted to verify something. I've verified it. Thank you." She turned away toward the door. "We'd better get back. No, please -- no questions yet. I can't possibly explain until after you've seen the Record."</p>
    <p>"The Record? What -- "</p>
    <p>"It's something that was dug up in Crete. It's -- peculiar. But thoroughly convincing. You'll see it soon. Shall we go back?"</p>
    <p>She locked the door behind us.</p>
    <p>Certainly De Kalb didn't look his forty-seven years any more than a Greek statue does. He looked like a young man, big and well proportioned. His sleek hair lay flat and short upon his head, and his face was handsome in the vacant way the Belvedere's is.</p>
    <p>There was no latent expression upon it and you felt that no emotions had ever drawn lines about the mouth or between the brows. Either he had never felt any or his control was such that he could suppress all feeling. There was the same placidity you see in the face of Buddha.</p>
    <p>There was something odd about his eyes -- I couldn't make out their color. They seemed to be filmed as though with a cat's third eyelid. Light blue, I thought, or gray, and curiously dull.</p>
    <p>He gave me a strong handshake and collapsed into an overstaffed chair, hoisted his feet to a hassock. Grunting, he blinked at me with his dull stare. There was a curious clumsiness to his motions, and when he spoke, a curious ponderous quality in his diction. He seemed to feel something like indulgent contempt for the rest of the world. It was all right, I suppose. Nobody had better reason. The man was a genius.</p>
    <p>"Glad you're here, Mr. Cortland," he said hoarsely. "I need you. Not for your intelligence which is slight. Not for your physical abilities, obviously sapped by years of wasteful and juvenile dissipation. But I have an excellent reason to think we may work well together."</p>
    <p>"I was sent to get an interview for Spread," I told him.</p>
    <p>"You were not." De Kalb raised a forefinger. "You err through ignorance, sir. Robert Allister, the publisher of Spread is a friend of mine. He has money. He has agreed to do the world and me a service. You are under contract to him, so you do as he says. He says you will work with me. Is that clear?"</p>
    <p>"Lucid," I told him. "Except I don't work that way. The contract says I'm to handle news assignments. I read the fine print too. There was no mention of peonage."</p>
    <p>"This is a news assignment. I shall give you an interview. But first, the Record. I see no point in futile discussion. Dr. Essen, will you be kind enough -- " He nodded toward a cupboard.</p>
    <p>She got out a parcel wrapped in cloth, handed it to De Kalb. He held it on his knee, unopened, tapped his fingers on its top. It was about the size and shape of a portable typewriter case.</p>
    <p>"I have showed the contents of this," he said, "only to Dr. Essen. And -- "</p>
    <p>"I am convinced," Dr. Essen said dryly. "Oh yes, Ira. I am convinced I"</p>
    <p>"Now I show it to you," De Kalb said and held out the package. "Put it on the table -- so. Now draw up a chair. Remove the wrappings. Excellent. And now -- "</p>
    <p>They were both leaning forward, watching me expectantly. I glanced from them to the battered box, then back again. It was a tarnished blue-white rectangle, battered, smudged with dirt, perfecly plain.</p>
    <p>"It is of no known metal," De Kalb said. "Some alloy, I think. It was found fifteen years ago in an excavation in Crete and sent to me unopened. Not intentionally. Nobody has ever been able to open it until recently. It is, as you may have guessed, a puzzle box. It took me fourteen years to learn the trick that would unlock it. It is also apparently indestructible. I shall now perform the trick for you."</p>
    <p>His hands moved upon the battered surface. I saw his nails whiten now and then as he put pressure on it.</p>
    <p>"Now," he said. "It opens. But I shall not watch. Letta, will you? No, I think it will be better for us both if we look away while Mr. Cortland -- "</p>
    <p>I stopped listening along about then. For the box was slowly opening.</p>
    <p>It opened like a jewel. Or like an unfolding flower that had as many facets as a jewel. I had expected a lid to lift but nothing of the sort happened. There was movement. There were facets and planes sliding and shifting and turning as though hinged, but what had seemed to be a box changed and reassembled and unfolded before me until it was -- what? As much a jewel as anything. Angles, planes, a shape and a shining.</p>
    <p>Simultaneously there was motion in my own mind. As a tuning fork responds to a struck note, so something like a vibration bridged the gap between the box and my brain. As a book opens, as leaves turn, a book opened and leaves turned in my mind.</p>
    <p>All time compressed itself into that blinding second. There was a shifting reorientation, motions infinitely fast that fitted and meshed with such precision the book and my mind were one.</p>
    <p>The Record opened itself inside my brain. Complete, whole, a history and a vision, it hung for that one instant lucid and detailed in my mind. And for that moment outside time I did comprehend. But the mind could not retain it all. It flashed out and burned along my nerves and then it faded and was only a pulse, a glimpse, hanging on like an after-image in my memory. I had seen -- and forgotten.</p>
    <p>But I had not forgotten everything.</p>
    <p>Across a gulf of inconceivable eons a Face looked at me from red sky and empty earth. The Face of Ea ...</p>
    <p>The room spun around me.</p>
    <p>"Here," Dr. Essen's voice murmured at my shoulder. I looked up dizzily, took the glass of brandy she offered. I'm not sure now whether or not I had a moment of unconsciousness. I know my eyes blurred and the room tilted before me. I drank the brandy gratefully.</p>

     <p>3. THE VISION OF TIME</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>De Kalb said, Tell us what you saw."</p>
    <p>"You -- you've seen it too?" The brandy helped but I wasn't yet steady. I didn't want to talk about what had flashed through my mind in that unending, dissolving glimpse which was slipping fragment by fragment out of my memory as I sat there. And yet I did want to talk.</p>
    <p>"I've seen it," De Kalb's ponderous nod was grim. "Letta Essen has seen it. Now you. Three of us. We all get the same thing and yet -- details differ. Three witnesses to the same scene tell three different stories. Each sees with a different brain. Tell us how it seemed to you."</p>
    <p>I swirled the brand around in my glass. My thoughts swirled with it, hot and potent as the liquor and as volatile. Give me ten minutes more, I thought, and they'll evaporate.</p>
    <p>"Red sky," I said slowly. "Empty landscape. And -- " The word stuck in my throat. I couldn't name it.</p>
    <p>"The Face," De Kalb supplied impatiently. "Yes, I know. Go on."</p>
    <p>"The Face of Ea," I said. "How do I know its name? Ea and time -- time -- " Suddenly the brandy splashed across my hand. I was shaking with reaction so violent I could not control it and I was shaking because of time. I got the glass to my lips, using both hands, and drained what was left.</p>
    <p>The second reaction passed and I thought I had myself under control.</p>
    <p>"Time," I said deliberately, letting the thought of it pour through my mind in a long, cold, dark-colored tide that had no motion. Time hasn't, of course. But when you see it as I did, at first the concept makes the brain rock in your skull.</p>
    <p>"Time -- ahead of our time. Uncountable thousands of years in our future. It was all there, wasn't it? The civilizations rising and falling one after another until -- the last city of all. The City of the Face."</p>
    <p>"You saw it was a city?" De Kalb leaned forward quickly. "That's good. That's very good. It took me three times to find that out."</p>
    <p>"It didn't see it. I -- I just knew."</p>
    <p>I closed my eyes. Before me the empty landscape floated, dark, almost night, under the dim red sky.</p>
    <p>I knew the Face was enormous. The side of some mountain had been carved away to reveal it and, I supposed, carved with tools by human hands. But you had the feeling that the Face must always have been there, that one day it had wakened in the rock and given one great grimace of impatience and the mountainside had sloughed away from its features, leaving Ea to look out into eternity over the red night of the world.</p>
    <p>"There are people inside," I said. "I could feel them, being there. Feel their thoughts, I suppose. People in an enormous city, a metropolis behind the Face."</p>
    <p>"Not a metropolis," De Kalb said. "A nekropolis. There's a difference. But -- yes, it's a city."</p>
    <p>"Streets," I said dreamily, sniffing the empty glass. "Levels of homes and public buildings. People moving, living, thinking. What do you mean, nekropolis?"</p>
    <p>"Tell you later. Go on."</p>
    <p>"I wish I could. It's fading." I closed my eyes again, thinking of the Face. I had to force my mind to turn around in its tracks and look, for it didn't want to confront that infinite complexity again. The Face was painful to see. It was too intricate, too involved with emotions complex beyond our grasp. It was painful for the mind to think of it, straining to understand the inscrutable things that experience had etched upon those mountain-high features.</p>
    <p>"Is it a portrait?" I asked suddenly. "Or a composite? What is the Face?"</p>
    <p>"A city," De Kalb said. "A nation. The ultimate in human destiny -- and a call for help. And much more that we'll never understand."</p>
    <p>"But -- the future!" I said. "That box -- didn't you say it was found in Crete? Dug up in old ruins? How could something from the past be a record of our own future? It doesn't make sense."</p>
    <p>"Very little makes sense, sir, when you come to examine the nature of time." De Kalb's voice was ponderous again. He heaved himself up a little and folded his thick fingers, looking at me above them with veiled gray eyes.</p>
    <p>"Have you read Spengler, Mr. Cortland?" he asked.</p>
    <p>I grimaced and nodded.</p>
    <p>"I know, I know. He has a high irritant value. But the man had genius, just the same. His concept of the community, moving through its course from 'culture' to dead and petrifying 'civilization' is what happened to the city of the Face.</p>
    <p>"I said 'happened' because I have to use the past tense for that nekropolis of the future. It exists. It has accomplished itself in time as fully as Babylon or Rome. And the men in it are not men at all in the sense we know. They are gods."</p>
    <p>He looked at me as if he expected me to object. I said nothing.</p>
    <p>"They are gods," He went on. "Spengler was wrong, of course, in thinking of any human progress in one simple, romantic curve. You have only to compare fourteenth century Rome with sixteenth century Rome to see that a nekropolis, as Mumford calls it, can pull itself together and become a metropolis again, a living, vital unit in human culture.</p>
    <p>"I have no quarrel with Spengler in his interpretations of a culture within itself. But both he and Toynbee went astray in their ideas of the symbolic value of a city. When you go further into the Record you'll see what I mean."</p>
    <p>He paused, put out a large hand and fumbled in a dish of fruit on the table at his elbow. He found an orange and peered at it dubiously, hefted it once or twice, then closed his fingers over it and went on with his discourse.</p>
    <p>"In a moment," he said, "I want to show you something with this orange as an illustration. First, however, I must do Spengler the justice of allowing the validity of his theories, in the ultimate. The City of the Face has run its course. It is a nekropolis, in the sense that Mumford uses the term.</p>
    <p>"In our times, a nekropolis such as Rome once was, and such as New York must be someday, needn't mean the end of our civilization, because a city isn't a whole nation. There were outlying villages that flourished all the better when Rome ceased to dominate their world. When the dark ages closed over Europe it wasn't by any means the end of the civilized world -- elsewhere on the planet new cultures were rising and old ones flourishing. But the City of the Face is a very different matter.</p>
    <p>"That City is really Nekropolis and there are no outlying villages to carry on, no outlying cultures rising toward fruition. In all that world there is only the one great City where mankind survives. And they aren't men -- they are gods. Gods, sir!"</p>
    <p>"Then it can't really be a nekropolis," I objected.</p>
    <p>"It need not be. That's up to us."</p>
    <p>"How?"</p>
    <p>"You saw my hearth. Dr. Essen showed you the stain of plague that is creeping across it. Oh yes, my friend, that stain is spreading! Slowly, but with a rate of growth that increases as it goes. The negative matter -- no, not even negative. Not even that. But it happened to the world of the Face. That whole planet is nekronic matter except for the City itself.</p>
    <p>"You didn't sense that from your first experience with the Record? No? You will. The people in the City can't save themselves by direct action on the world around them. They appeal to us. We can save them. I don't yet know how. But they know or they wouldn't have appealed in just the way they did."</p>
    <p>"Wait a minute," I said. "Let me get this straight. You're asking me to accept a lot, you know. The only premise I've got to believe in is the -- the Record. But what do you want from me, personally? How do I come into it? Why me?"</p>
    <p>De Kalb shifted in his chair, sighed heavily, opened his fingers and peered at the orange he held as if he had never seen it before. He grimaced.</p>
    <p>"Sir, you're right. I accept the rebuke. Let me give you facts. Item, the Record. It is, in effect, a book. But not a book made by human minds. And it must, as you know, be experienced, not read. Each time you open the box you will get the same flash of complete vision, and each time you will forget a little less as your mind is conditioned. But there will always be facets of that tremendous story which will elude us, I think. Our minds can never wholly grasp what lies inside that box ...</p>
    <p>"It was found in Crete. It had lain there perhaps three thousand years, perhaps five thousand -- I think, myself, a million. It came into my hands half by accident. I could not open it. Off and on I tried. That is my habit. I used X-rays to look through the substance of the box. Of course I saw nothing.</p>
    <p>"I detected radioactivity, and I tested it with certain of the radio-elements. I exposed it to supersonics. I -- well, I tried many things. Something worked. Something clicked the safety, so that one day it opened. You see -- " He looked at me gravely. "You see, it was time."</p>
    <p>"Time?"</p>
    <p>"That box was made with a purpose, obviously. It was sent to us, with a message. I say to us but the aim was less direct. It was sent through time, Mr. Cortland -- through time itself -- and the address said simply, 'To be opened only by a skilled technological civilization.' "</p>
    <p>"All right," I said. "Suppose it came through time. Suppose it's an appeal for help. I didn't get that, but I'm willing to believe I might if I opened the box often enough. But why do you assume this is a living issue, here and now? You imply the fate of the City depends on us. If that box is as old as you say, isn't it more likely the City of the Face existed somewhere in the prehistoric past?</p>
    <p>"They made a record -- I can't deny that. They cast it adrift in time like a note in a bottle and it floated ashore here and we read it. Sure. But it makes a good enough news-story for me the logical way -- a relic of a dead civilization a million years old. That I could write. But -- "</p>
    <p>"You are not here to write a news story, sir!" De Kalb's voice was sharp.</p>
    <p>"That's what my contract says I'm here for."</p>
    <p>"You were chosen," De Kalb said heavily. "You were chosen. Not by Allister. Not by me." He shifted uneasily. "Let me go on a little." He peered at the orange, tossed it up and caught it with a smack in his palm. "I opened the box for the first time," he said, "in my studio.</p>
    <p>"You've seen it. I saw the box unfolding like a flower. For the first time in a million years -- opening up in four dimensions, or perhaps more than four, with that tesseract motion which the eye can only partly see. But that first time, sir -- something more happened." He paused, hesitated, said in a reluctant voice, "Something came out of the box."</p>
    <p>I waited. Dr. Essen, who had scarcely moved since this talk began, got up abruptly and went to stand at the window, her back to us, looking out over the great brown tumble of mountains beyond.</p>
    <p>"It came out of the box," De Kalb said in a rapid voice, as if he didn't want to talk about this and was determined to get it over as fast as he could. "It passed me. It leaped toward the fireplace. And it was gone. When I looked, I saw nothing. But that evening I noticed the first spot of the stain upon the stone. In the stone. It meant little to me then -- I had not yet learned enough from the Record to be afraid. But I know now."</p>

     <p>4. THE LAURENTIAN STORY</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Again I waited. This time I had to prompt him.</p>
    <p>"Know what?"</p>
    <p>"The nekron," he said. "It's growing. It will never stop growing, until -- " He paused, shrugged. "We have to believe they're in the future," he said. "We have to help them. They made sure of that. For unless we do the nekron will grow and grow until our world is like theirs -- dead matter. Inert. Nekronic. I call it that because it is death.</p>
    <p>"An absolutely new form of matter, the death of energy. It breaks a supreme law of our universe, the law of increasing entropy. Entropy trends toward chaos, naturally. But the nekron is the other extreme, a pattern, a dead null-energy pattern of negation."</p>
    <p>"You mean," I demanded, "that the people of the City deliberately set a trap for the man who first opened the box?"</p>
    <p>"They had to. They had to make sure we'd answer their appeal to save ourselves."</p>
    <p>"Then you're convinced they exist in the future, not the past?"</p>
    <p>"You saw the Face. You were aware, you say, of the waves of civilization rising and falling between our time and theirs? How can you doubt it, then, Mr. Cortland?"</p>
    <p>I was silent, remembering.</p>
    <p>"It doesn't matter," De Kalb went on. "That question is purely academic. Past or future is all one in the time-fabric you will understand better after you've opened the box again."</p>
    <p>"But," I said, "how can we help them? If they can't destroy the menace to their own world, whatever it is, how could we? It's ridiculous. And anyhow, if time-travel was possible for the box -- which I don't for a moment really accept -- how could it be possible for tangible, living men from our time? And if it were, how could you be sure you weren't dashing off to save a city that would prove when you found it to be already dead? Overwhelmed a million years ago? How is it -- "</p>
    <p>"No, no, Mr. Cortland!" De Kalb held up a large hand with an orange balanced on its palm. "You have so much to learn! Allow me the intelligence to think of those objections myself! Surely you don't imagine all that hadn't occurred to me already?</p>
    <p>"The answer is that the nekron can be destroyed -- or at least that the problem it poses can be solved. I believe it can be solved only by this method -- three men and one woman must go into the future age that holds the Face of Ea. For that, apparently, was the original plan of the people of the Face."</p>
    <p>"What makes you so certain of that?"</p>
    <p>"A number of factors. The Record was sent to our civilization, remember?"</p>
    <p>I had him there. "But it was found in Cretan ruins, you said."</p>
    <p>"Certainly. And the ancient Minoans didn't open it. I suspect the Record existed long before the time of Theseus -- but it remained unopened until a neotechnical civilization had developed on this planet. Only men -- and women -- who were products of such a culture would have the qualities necessary to solve the nekronic problem."</p>
    <p>"Why didn't they send the Record directly to our era? Why did they miss the right time by thousands of years?"</p>
    <p>"I am no expert in the specialized restrictions of time-traveling," De Kalb said, with some irritation. "It may be that too-accurate aim is impossible. How can I tell that? The Record reached the right hands. I can easily prove that."</p>
    <p>But I was searching for errata. "You said we'd have the qualities that could solve the nekronic problem -- destroy it, I suppose you mean. Well? Have you solved it?"</p>
    <p>De Kalb lost his ill-temper and beamed at me. "No," he said. "Not yet. The nekronic matter itself is very curious -- atypical, completely. It is absolutely nonreactive. It has no spectrum. It emits no energy. No known reagent affects it in the slightest degree. It is a new type of matter, plain and simple. I cannot destroy it -- not yet. Not now. But I believe I can do it with the guidance and aid of the people of the Face. As a matter of -- "</p>
    <p>The telephone on the table beside him buzzed sharply. Dr. Essen swung around with a start. De Kalb grunted, nodded at her, muttered, "I'm afraid so," as if in answer to a question and took up the telephone with his free hand.</p>
    <p>It sputtered at him.</p>
    <p>"All right, put him on," De Kalb said in a resigned voice. The receiver buzzed and sputtered again. De Kalb's placid features grimaced, smoothed out, grimaced again. "Now Murray," he said. "Now Murray -- no, wait a minute! Confound it, Murray, allow me to -- I know you are, but -- "</p>
    <p>The telephone would not let him speak. It crackled angrily, a word now and then coming out clearly. De Kalb listened in resigned silence. Finally he heaved himself up in the chair and spoke with sudden resolution.</p>
    <p>"Murray," he said sharply, "Murray, listen to me. Cortland's here."</p>
    <p>The phone crackled. De Kalb grinned. "I know you don't," he said. "Probably Cortland doesn't like you either. That's not important. Murray, can you come up here? Yes, it is important. I have something to show you." He hesitated, glanced at Dr. Essen, shrugged. "I am casting the die, Murray," he said. "I want to show you a certain box."</p>
    <p>"You know Colonel Harrison Murray?" De Kalb asked. I nodded. I knew and disliked him for personal qualities quite apart from his ability. He was old army, West Point, a martinet. He had the violent, uncontrolled emotions of an hysterical woman and the mechanical brilliance of a -- well, a robot.</p>
    <p>No one could deny his genius. He prided himself on being scrupulously just, which he wasn't. But he thought he was. A fine technician, a genius at strategy and tactics. He confirmed that in the Pacific, back in '45. I'd done a profile on him once and he hadn't liked it at all.</p>
    <p>"You're taking him in on this?" I asked.</p>
    <p>"I've got to. He can make it too hot for me unless he understands. You see, I've been working with him on -- never mind. But he insists I go on with it. He can't see how important this new business is."</p>
    <p>"Ira." Dr. Essen put in timidly. "Ira, do you really think it's wise? To bring the colonel in yet, I mean. Are you sure?"</p>
    <p>"You know I'm not, Letta." He frowned. "But there's so little time to be lost, now. I don't dare wait any longer. Mr. Cortland -- " He swung around toward me. "Mr. Cortland, I see it is now time to give you one more bit of knowledge. I have a story to tell you, about myself and you. Surely you must have realized by now that you are involved in this thing far beyond any power of mine to accept or dismiss."</p>
    <p>I nodded. I did know that. I thought briefly of the things that had happened to me in Rio, of the affinity I had sensed without understanding between that stain on the hearthstone and the -- the creature which had scorched my hand in Rio and the deaths that had come after. Would they stop now -- in Rio? Would they begin again, nearer home? There had to be some connection -- coincidence just doesn't stretch that far. But all I could do was wait.</p>
    <p>"This is my story," De Kalb said. "Our story, Mr. Cortland. Yours and mine, Dr. Essen's -- perhaps Colonel Murray's too. I don't know. I wish I did. Well, I'll get on with it." He sighed heavily. "After I had experienced the Record many times," he said "I began to realize that there was in it reference to a certain spot on the earth's surface that had a rather mystifying importance.</p>
    <p>"I was unable to grasp why. The place was localized by latitude, longitude, various methods of cross-reference. It took me a long while to work it out in terms of our own world and era and decimal system. But finally I did it.</p>
    <p>"I went there." He paused, regarding me gravely. "Have you ever been in the Laurentians, Mr. Cortland? Do you know the wildness of those mountains? So near here by air, and so far off in another world, once you arrive and the sound of your motor ceases. You imagine then that you can hear the silences of the arctic wastes, which are all that lie beyond that band of northern forests.</p>
    <p>"Well, I hired men. I sank a shaft. They thought I was simply a prospector with more money and fewer brains than most. Fortunately they didn't know my real reason -- that the spot I was hunting had turned out to be underground. You get some curious superstitions up there in the wilds -- perhaps not curious. In many ways they're wise men. But my spot, in this era at least, had to be dug for.</p>
    <p>"My instruments showed me a disturbance toward which the shaft was angled. And eventually we came to the source of that disturbance. We found it. We hollowed a cavern around it. After that I dismissed the men and settled down to study the thing I had found." He laughed abruptly.</p>
    <p>"It was twenty feet of nothing, Mr. Cortland. An oval of disturbance, egg-shaped, cloudy to the eye. I could walk through it. But, inside that oval, space and matter were walled off from our own space and matter by a barrier that was, I know now, supra-dimensional. A man may move from light to dark, encountering no barrier -- yet the difference is manifest. There were tremendous differences here.</p>
    <p>"Also there was something inside. I was convinced of that long before I got my first glimpse of it. I tried many things. It was finally under a bombardment of UV that I saw the first shadowy shape inside that nothingness. I increased the power, I decreased it, I played with the vernier like a violinist on a Stradivarius.</p>
    <p>"I chased that elusive mystery up and down through the light bands like a cat on a mouse's trail. And at last, quite clearly, I saw -- " He broke off, grinning at me.</p>
    <p>"No, I shall not tell you yet what I saw," he said. "You wouldn't believe me. The moment has now come, Mr. Cortland, when I must give you a little lesson on the nature of time." He held up the orange, revolving it slowly between his fingers.</p>
    <p>"A sphere," he said, "revolving on an axis. Call it Earth." He put out his other hand and took up from the fruit bowl a silver knife with a leaf-shaped blade a little broader than the orange. With great deliberation he slid the edge through the rind.</p>

    <title>
     <p>5. THE DEATH CARRIERS</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>What happened then came totally without warning. In one moment I sat comfortably in my chair watching De Kalb drew the knife-blade through the orange. In the next --</p>
    <p>A blinding nova of pure energy exploded outward from a nexus in the center of my body.</p>
    <p>The room ceased to be. De Kalb and Dr. Essen were unrealities far off at the periphery of that exploding nova. Vitality ran like fire through every nerve and vein, like an adrenalin charge inconceivably magnified. There was nothing in the world for one timeless moment but the bursting glow of that experience for which I have no name.</p>
    <p>The first thing I saw when the room came back into focus around me was the blood running from De Kalb's hand.</p>
    <p>It meant nothing to me, in that first instant. Blood is the natural concomitant of death, and I knew that somewhere not far away a man had died a moment before. Then my senses came back and I sat up abruptly, staring at De Kalb's face.</p>
    <p>The color had drained out of it. He was looking at his cut hand with a blank unseeing gaze. There was a little blood on the silver knife. It was nothing. He had only cut himself slightly because of --</p>
    <p>Because of --</p>
    <p>Our eyes met. I think the knowledge came simultaneously into our minds in that meeting of glances. He had felt it too. The explosion of white energy had burst outward in his nerve centers in the same moment it burst in mine. Neither of us spoke. It wasn't necessary.</p>
    <p>After what seemed a long while I looked at Dr. Essen. That bright steel glance of hers met mine squarely but there was only bewilderment in it.</p>
    <p>"What happened?" she asked.</p>
    <p>The sound of her voice seemed to release us both from our speechlessness.</p>
    <p>"You don't know?" De Kalb swung around to look at her. "No, evidently you don't. But Mr. Cortland and I -- Cortland, how often have you -- " He groped for words.</p>
    <p>"Since the first of the deaths in Rio," I said flatly. "You?"</p>
    <p>"Since the first of them here. And ever since, though, very faintly, when they happened in Rio."</p>
    <p>"What are you talking about?" Dr. Essen demanded.</p>
    <p>Heavily, speaking with deliberation, De Kalb told her.</p>
    <p>"For myself," he finished, glancing at me, "it began when I first opened the Record." He paused, looked at his hand with some surprise and, laying down orange and knife, pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and wrapped it around the bleeding cut. "I didn't feel that at all," he said, almost to himself.</p>
    <p>And then, to me, "I opened the Record. I told you that -- something -- went by me very fast and vanished at the spot where that nekronic strain later came into existence." He looked at me soberly, his eyes narrowed. "Mr. Cortland," he said, "can you tell me that you did not experience any feeling of recognition when you first saw that stain on the hearth?"</p>
    <p>I got up so suddenly that my chair almost tipped over. Violently I said, "De Kalb, somewhere a man has just died! Something killed him. Something is making you and me accessories to murder! We've got to put a stop to it! This isn't an academic discussion -- it's murder! We -- "</p>
    <p>"Sit down, Mr. Cortland, sit down." De Kalb's voice was tired. "I know quite well it's murder. We must and will discover the truth about it. But not by shouting at one another. The truth lies in that box on the table. It lies somewhere very far in the future.</p>
    <p>"Also, the truth is a being that roams our world, murdering at will. I released it, Mr. Cortland. Unwittingly, but I released it. That was a Pandora's box I opened. Trouble and death came out of it. We can only pray that there is hope in the bottom of it, as there was in Pandora's box."</p>
    <p>"Look," I said. "Tell me how I can help and I'll do it. But let's not have any more generalities. I'm too close to these deaths. I think I'm in personal danger. Maybe you are too. What can we do?"</p>
    <p>"We are not in personal danger from the killer. From the law -- perhaps -- if this connection from which we suffer were to become known. What can we do? I wish I could tell you. I'm sure of this much -- that thing which came from the box, leaving the stain of nekronic matter like a footprint behind it, is a living and dangerous creature. It touched me as it went by. I think by that touch I've become -- well, remotely akin to it. Were you touched too?"</p>
    <p>I told him.</p>
    <p>"Very well," he said. "We are in danger. Has it occurred to you yet that where it touched the hearthstone, the nekron took root?"</p>
    <p>For a moment I didn't see what he meant. Then the implication hit me and I went cold and empty inside. De Kalb, seeing the look on my face, laughed shortly.</p>
    <p>"I see it has. Very well. So far I haven't detected any sign of nekronic infection in myself. I assume you haven't either. But that proves nothing."</p>
    <p>"Have you seen the creature?" I asked. He hesitated. "I can't be sure. I think I have. Will you tell me exactly what happened to you, please? Every detail, even the irrelevant."</p>
    <p>And when I had finished, he exchanged troubled glances with Dr. Letta Essen. "Directive intelligence, then," she said.</p>
    <p>"The way it moved," De Kalb murmured. "That's highly significant. And the impossibility of getting a firm grip on the creature. So -- Letta, do you agree?"</p>
    <p>"Frictional burns?" she asked. "But it didn't move fast enough to cause those. That is -- not spatially."</p>
    <p>"Not in space, no," De Kalb said. "But in time? Limited, of course. A few seconds' leeway would be enough if you consider the energy expended and the tremendous velocities involved. It looks like a shadow -- it seems to have mass without weight -- and it has high velocity without spatial motion.</p>
    <p>"And Mr. Cortland's tightening his grip on the creature seemed to push it away. Time-movement, then! It vibrates -- it has an oscillating period of existence, certainly limited within a range of a few seconds. A tuning-fork vibrates in space. Why not vibration through time -- with an extremely narrow range?</p>
    <p>"No wonder you couldn't hold the creature! Could you hold a metal rod vibrating that rapidly? You would get frictional burns on your hands -- since your own weight would prevent you from partaking of its motion. The being's existence must be, to a limited degree, extra-temporal.</p>
    <p>"Consequently, I suppose any weapon used against it would have to be keyed to its own temporal periodicity. That is, if we had a pistol oscillating in time, we might be able to shoot the creature. But the hand that squeezed the trigger might have to be oscillating too."</p>
    <p>"Trembling like a leaf," I said. "I know mine would be."</p>
    <p>He brushed that away. "How intelligent is this killer? Is ego involved, or merely vampirism? If the creature read your mind -- " He grimaced. "No. No! The missing factor is what the nekron itself is and its special qualities. And we don't know that. We probably never will until we go to the Face of Ea."</p>
    <p>I sighed. I sat down. I'd had too many jolts in the past half hour to feel very sure of myself.</p>
    <p>"So we travel in time," I said wearily "Mr. De Kalb -- you're crazy."</p>
    <p>He had enough energy left to chuckle rather wanly.</p>
    <p>"You'll think me even crazier, sir, when I tell you what it was I saw down there under the mountain, in the cavern. But I must finish my demonstration before you'll be able to understand."</p>
    <p>"Get on with it, then."</p>
    <p>He took up orange and knife again. He fitted the blade into the cut and finished the job of bisecting the fruit a little above its equator. The severed top half lay upon the blade as on a narrow plate. Below it he held the other half of the orange in place, so that it still maintained its unbroken sphere.</p>
    <p>"Consider this blade Flatland," he said. "A world of two dimensions, intersecting the three-dimensional sphere. Now if I revolve the lower half of the orange, you will please imagine that the upper half revolves with it. One fruit -- you see? The axis remains immovable in relation to the plane in Flatland it intersects.</p>
    <p>"Now. I cut this lower half again, straight through. The same axis intersects the same point on this Flatland. In other words, the spatial axis remains stable. You understand so far?"</p>
    <p>"No," I said. He grinned, tossed knife and fruit back into the bowl.</p>
    <p>"It takes thinking," he said. "Let me go on. Now time is also a sphere. Time revolves. And time has an axis -- a single stable extension of a temporal point, drawn through past and future alike, intersecting them all, as that knife-blade touched the orange everywhere in the Flatland dimension. And that, Mr. Cortland, is what makes travel in time theoretically valid.</p>
    <p>"The theory of time-travel usually ignores space. The traveler steps into some semi-magical machine, presses a button and emerges a thousand years in the future -- but on earth!" He snorted. "In a thousand years, or a thousand days, or in one day, or one minute, this planet along with the whole solar system would have traveled far beyond its position at the moment the traveler entered his machine.</p>
    <p>"But there is one point from which he could enter the machine, enter time itself and be sure always of emerging on earth. For each planet, I think, there is one single point. The spot in the Laurentians where I saw -- what I saw was that point for our planet. It is the spot at which the axis of the time-sphere intersects our own three-dimensional world. If it were possible to follow the line of the particular axis you would move through time.</p>
    <p>"Well, I believe there is movement but along still another dimension, beyond this theoretical fourth which is time -- or supertime. Call it a fifth. This much I'm sure of -- if you could stay in the time axis indefinitely the ultra-time drift would carry you into another era, through era beyond era, wherever other ages intersect the time axis." He shook his head.</p>
    <p>"I admit I don't understand it too clearly. It's a science beyond ours. However, I think I can explain the presence of the Record box now. I believe the people of the Face sent it back in a direction parallel to the time-axis -- which, remember, intersects the same area in space always, at any given moment. They sent it very far back, millennia into our past -- as you say, like people tossing a message in a bottle into the stream of time.</p>
    <p>"Look." He held up his hand, thumb and forefinger touching at the tips. "Two times -- my finger and thumb. But they touch at one point only. There you can cross. From the time of the Face to, let us say, some thousands of years B.C. This is vague again, and it is something I don't understand.</p>
    <p>"The extension is along still another dimension, possibly the ultra-sphere, this figurative fifth. But it's logical to suppose there would be such a limitation. There is in space. You can step spatially only into areas spatially adjoining yours. And in time -- well, it may apply there too."</p>
    <p>"All right," I said. "Okay up to now. I'll accept it. Now let's have the kicker. What was it you saw in your cave?"</p>
    <p>De Kalb leaned back in his chair, regarding me with a grin.</p>
    <p>"I saw you, Mr. Cortland."</p>
    <p>I gaped at him.</p>
    <p>His grin broadened.</p>
    <p>"Yes, I saw you, lying alseep on the floor of the -- the egg. I saw myself there too, asleep. I saw Dr. Essen. And lastly I saw Colonel Harrison Murray."</p>
    <p>He looked at me with obscure triumph, his grin very wide.</p>
    <p>"You're crazy," I said bluntly.</p>
    <p>"You're thinking you've never been in a cavern under a Laurentian mountain, I suppose. Very likely. Nor has Dr. Essen. Nor, I imagine, Murray. But you will be, my friend. So will we all." The grin faded. Now the deep voice was graver. "And we are all changed, there in the egg. You understand that?</p>
    <p>"We are older, by a little, not temporally, but in experience. You can see that on our faces. We have all passed through strange experiences -- good, bad, awe-inspiring, perhaps. And the men look -- tired, older. But Dr. Essen looks strangely younger." He shrugged heavily. "I don't attempt to explain it. I can only report what I saw," He smiled at me.</p>
    <p>"Well, so much for that. Don't look so stunned, Mr. Cortland! I assure you it was yourself. Which means that you will go with us when we take our great leap into the future, into the world of the Face. I believe we will all stand together in the living flesh before that great Face we have seen only in our minds, today.</p>
    <p>"Believe? I know it. Those people lying asleep in the time-axis, with instruments on the floor around them to regulate their slumbers, will go forward in time -- have gone forward. And they will return in the end to here and now.</p>
    <p>"They will go as the box went. From the here and now, forward through the time-axis to the world of the Face. But there is no backward flow along that axis. No one can risk meeting himself in his own past, even if such a thing were possible. So when we return, we must come as the box did, along a path which is parallel to the axis, to that continuous point in time which may be millennia B.C., where the box originally emerged.</p>
    <p>"In effect, one goes forward with the flow along the time axis and back around the circumference of the sphere which is time. And there we enter the time-axis chamber again, and are carried forward along the flow to our own present time." He smiled.</p>
    <p>"Do you see what that means? It means that one day those four in the Laurentian cavern will waken. And as they wake, as they step out, three men and a woman will enter the chamber and begin their journey into time!"</p>
    <p>I gave my head a quick shake. Images were whirling in it like sparks from a Fourth-of-July pinwheel. None of them made sense to me, or perhaps only one. But that one was definite.</p>
    <p>"Oh no they won't," I said.</p>
    <p>"Why not?"</p>
    <p>"I will quote you a vulgarism," I said meticulously. "There may be flies on some of you guys, but there ain't no flies on me. I'm not going. I know when I'm well off. Jerry Cortland is staying right here with both feet firm upon his own temporal axis. I will write you the best story you ever saw about yourself, Mr. De Kalb, but I won't climb on any merry-go-rounds with you. Is that clear?"</p>
    <p>He chuckled deeply.</p>
    <p>"But you did, Mr. Cortland -- you did!"</p>

     <p>6. THE MILITARY MIND</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Colonel Harrison Murray, at sixty, still had a fine military figure and was proud of it. You could see him remember to throw his shoulders back and pull in his waist about once every ten minutes. Then age and the subject at hand would gradually divert him and he would sag slowly -- until he remembered again.</p>
    <p>He had a discontented drooping mouth, a face all flat slab-shaped planes and an incongruously high thin voice that got higher when he was angry, which was most of the time. He was angry now.</p>
    <p>"A man can't help it if he was born a fool, De Kalb," he said. "But luckily we're not all fools. You're going to drop this idiotic sideline of yours, whatever it is, and go back to work on our current job. You agreed to assist the War Department -- " He gave me a quick, wary glance. "You agreed to do a certain job."</p>
    <p>"I've done it," De Kalb told him. I've set up the Bureau and laid out all the plans. Oh, it's no secret -- we're not the only ones who've been experimenting along this line. I'll be willing to bet Mr. Cortland knows more than you think about this top-secret Bureau of ours. How about that?"</p>
    <p>He was looking at me. I said, "Well, I've heard rumors on the grapevine. Hypnotism, isn't it?"</p>
    <p>Murray swore softly. De Kalb chuckled.</p>
    <p>"Subliminal hypnosis," he said. "It doesn't matter, Colonel. The important secrets are the specialized techniques that have been worked out and they're still under cover -- I hope. The Bureau is operating efficiently now. I've set up the plan. Now there are competent researchers doing quite as much as I could do. If I stayed on now it would simply be as a figurehead. My usefulness was over when I explained my theories to the technicians and psychologists who were able to apply them."</p>
    <p>"Allow me to decide that," Murray said angrily and there was a pause.</p>
    <p>Quietly, from her chair by the window, Dr. Essen spoke. "Ira, perhaps if Colonel Murray saw the Record -- "</p>
    <p>"Of course," De Kalb said. "No use squabbling any further. Cortland, will you do the honors this time?"</p>
    <p>I opened the cupboard door. I took down the wrapped bundle which was the box. I set it on the table between De Kalb and Murray. The Colonel looked suspiciously at it.</p>
    <p>"If this is some childish joke -- " he began.</p>
    <p>"I assure you, sir, it's no joke. It is something the like of which you've never seen before, but there's nothing humorous about it. I think when you've looked into this -- this package -- you'll have no further objections to the problem I'm working on."</p>
    <p>De Kalb undid the wrappings. The stained and battered box, blue-white, imperishable as the time-currents upon which it had drifted so long, lay there before us, the universe and the destiny of man locked inside it.</p>
    <p>De Kalb's fingers moved upon its surface. There was a faint, distant ringing as if the hinges moved to a sound of music and the box unfolded like a flower.</p>
    <p>I didn't watch. I knew I'd get nothing further from it now until my mind had rested a little. I looked at the ceiling instead, where the lights from the unfolded leaves and facets of the Record moved in intricate patterns on the white plaster. Even that was hypnotic.</p>
    <p>It was very quiet in the room. The silence of the end of the world seemed to flow out of the box in waves, engulfing all sound except for De Kalb's heavy breathing and the quick rasping breath that came and went as Murray sat motionless, staring at the flicker of lights that had been lit at the world's end and sent back to us along the circumference of time.</p>
    <p>I found that I was holding myself tense in that silence. I was waiting -- waiting for the nova to burst again inside me, perhaps. Waiting for another killing, perhaps somewhere in my sight this time, perhaps someone in this room. And I was waiting for one thing more -- the first spreading coldness that might hint to me that my own flesh, like the stone of the studio hearth, had given root to the nekron.</p>
    <p>The box closed. The lights vanished from the ceiling.</p>
    <p>Murray very slowly sat upright in his chair ...</p>
    <p>De Kalb leaned back heavily, his curiously dull eyes full on Murray's face.</p>
    <p>"And that's the whole story," he said.</p>
    <p>It had taken over an hour of quick, incisive questions and painstaking answers to present Murray with a complete picture of the situation in which he himself played so curious a part. We all watched his face, searching, I think, for some sign of the tremendous intellectual and emotional experience through which everyone must go who opened that box.</p>
    <p>Nothing showed. It was the stranger because I knew Murray was almost a hysteric, psychologically. Perhaps he'd learned to control himself when he had to. Certainly he showed nothing of emotion as he shot his cold, watchful questions at De Kalb.</p>
    <p>"And you recognized me," he said now, narrowing his eyes at De Kalb. "I was in that -- that underground room?"</p>
    <p>"You were."</p>
    <p>Murray regarded him quietly, his mouth pulled downward in a curve of determination and anger.</p>
    <p>"De Kalb," he said, "you tell a good story. But you're a grasshopper. You always have been. You lose interest in every project as soon as you think you've solved it. Now listen to me a minute. The indoctrination project you were working on with me is not yet fully solved. I know you think so. But it isn't. I see exactly what's happened. Hypnosis as an indoctrination method has led you off onto this wild scheme. You intend to use hypnosis on whatever guinea-pigs you can enlist and -- "</p>
    <p>"It isn't true, Murray, It isn't true." De Kalb was not even indignant, only weary. "You saw the Record. You know."</p>
    <p>"All right," Murray admitted after a moment. "I saw the Record. Very well. Suppose you can go forward in time. Suppose you step out, back in the here and now, ten seconds after you step in. You say no time is lost. But what energy you'll lose, De Kalb! You'll be a different man, older, tired, full of experiences. Disinterested, maybe, in my project. I can't let you do it. I'll have to insist you finish that first and then do what you like on this Record deal of yours."</p>
    <p>"It can't be done, Murray," De Kalb said. "You can't get around it that way. I saw you in the time-chamber, remember. You did go."</p>
    <p>Murray put up an impatient hand. "Is this telephone connected with the exchange? Thanks. I can't argue with you, De Kalb. I have a job to do."</p>
    <p>We all sat quiet, watching him as he put a number through. He got his departmental headquarters. He got the man he wanted.</p>
    <p>"Murray speaking," he said .briskly. "I'm at De Kalb's in Connecticut. You know the place? I'm leaving immediately in my plane. I want you to check me in as soon as I get there, probably around three. I'm bringing a man named Cortland with me, newspaper fellow -- you know his work? Good? Now listen, this is important." Murray took a deep breath and regarded me coldly over the telephone. Very distinctly he said into it.</p>
    <p>"Cortland is responsible for that series of murders he reported from Brazil. I'm bringing him in for questioning."</p>

     <p>7. OUT OF CONTROL</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>I didn't like the way he flew his plane. His hands kept jiggling with the controls, his feet kept adjusting and readjusting the tail-flaps so that the ship was in constant, unnecessary side motion in the air, Murray was nervous.</p>
    <p>I looked down at the trees, the tilted mountain slopes, the roads shining in the sun, with little glittering black dots sliding along it that were cars.</p>
    <p>"You know you can't get away with this, Murray," I said. It was, I think, almost the first thing I had said to him since we took off half an hour ago. After all, there had been little to say. The situation was out of all our hands, as Murray had meant it to be, from the moment he spoke into the telephone.</p>
    <p>"I have got away with it, Cortland," he said, not looking at me.</p>
    <p>"De Kalb has connections as powerful as yours," I told him. "Besides, I think I can prove I'm not responsible for those deaths."</p>
    <p>"I think you are, Cortland. If there's any truth in what De Kalb was saying, I believe you're a carrier."</p>
    <p>"But you're not doing this because you think I'm guilty. You're doing it to stop De Kalb."</p>
    <p>"Certainly." He snapped his lips shut. I shrugged. That, of course, was obvious.</p>
    <p>We flew on in silence. Murray was uneasy, perhaps from the experience of the Record. I think now that he had entirely shut his mind to that. I think he was denying it had ever happened. But his hands and feet still jittered on the controls until I itched to take the plane away from him and fly it myself.</p>
    <p>It was a nice little ship, a six-passenger job that could have flown alone, almost, as any good plane can do in smooth air if the pilot will only let it. I would probably have said just then, if you'd asked me, that I was in plenty of trouble. My troubles hadn't started. They were about to.</p>
    <p>The first intimation was the sound Murray made -- a sort of deep, startled, incredulous grunt. I stopped to turn toward him. And then -- time stopped.</p>
    <p>I had a confused awareness that something was moving through the ship, something dark and frighteningly swift. But this time there was a difference. The thing I had first encountered in a Rio alley had returned. The first pulse of that nova of blinding brilliance burst outward from the core and center of my body. But it did not rise to its climactic explosion of pure violence. The energy suddenly was shut off at the source. The plane was empty of that monstrous intruder.</p>
    <p>Beside me Murray hunched over the controls, slowly bending forward. I could not see his face. That instant of relief passed in a flashing time-beat.</p>
    <p>Again the pulse throbbed through me. And again it was shut off. There was something terribly wrong with gravity. The earth stood upright in a blurred line that bisected the sky and was slowly, slowly toppling over from left to right. The weight of Murray's body, slumped heavily forward, was throwing the ship out of control.</p>
    <p>I couldn't move -- not while those erratic jumping shocks kept pounding at me.</p>
    <p>But I had to move. I had to get hold of the controls. And then, as I put forth all my strength, the explosion channeled into my brain -- different, somehow incomplete. I could feel a swiftly-fading ebb-tide draining into the empty void.</p>
    <p>Then it was gone altogether.</p>
    <p>Another part of my mind must have taken over then. And it must have been efficient. Myself, I seemed to be floating somewhere in a troubled void with the image of Murray's lolling head and limp arms. Murray -- dead. Dead? He must be dead. I knew that nekronic shock too well.</p>
    <p>In the mindless void where my awareness floated I knew that I was a bad spot temporally. Jerry Cortland was in a bad spot. Murray's headquarters must be expecting him in already with a murder suspect in tow. I was the murder suspect and murder had been done again. And Murray and I had been alone in mid-air when it happened.</p>
    <p>The efficient part of my mind knew what to do. I left it at that. I had no recollection whatever of fighting the plane out of its power dive or of turning in a long high circle as I got lost altitude back. But that must have happened. Time and distance meant nothing to the half of my mind that floated but the other half very efficiently flew the plane.</p>
    <p>"All right now?" De Kalb's voice inquired.</p>
    <p>I sat up shakily. The room was swimming around me but it was a familiar room, I could see Dr. Essen bending above a couch and I could see polished boots and a shoulder with something shiny on it. I must have brought Murray back. Murray -- dead?</p>
    <p>"It was -- it was the nekron," I said thickly.</p>
    <p>"I know, I know," De Kalb said. "You told us. Don't you remember?"</p>
    <p>"I don't remember anything except Murray."</p>
    <p>"I don't think we can save him," De Kalb said in a flat voice.</p>
    <p>"Then he's alive?"</p>
    <p>"Just."</p>
    <p>We both looked automatically toward the couch, where Dr. Essen lifted a worried face.</p>
    <p>"The adrenalin's helping," she said, "But there's no real improvement. He'll sink again as soon as the effect wears off."</p>
    <p>"Can't we get him to a hospital?" I asked.</p>
    <p>"I don't think medical treatment will help him," De Kalb said. "Dr. Essen has a medical degree, you know. She's already done everything the hospitals have tried on the other victims.</p>
    <p>"That creature strikes a place that scalpels and oxygen and adrenalin can't reach. I don't know what or where, but neither do the doctors." He moved his shoulders impatiently. "This is the first time the killer hasn't finished its job. You interrupted it, you know -- somehow. Do you know how?"</p>
    <p>"It was intermittent," I said hesitantly. "It kept going away and coming back." I explained in as much detail as I could. It wasn't easy.</p>
    <p>"The plane was moving fast, eh?" De Kalb murmured. "So. Always before the victims have been practically immobilized. That might explain part of it. If the nekronic creature is vibrating through time it might need a fixed locus in space. And the plane was moving very fast in space. That could explain why the attack was incomplete -- but complete enough, after all."</p>
    <p>I nodded. "This is going to be pretty hard to explain to Murray's headquarters," I said.</p>
    <p>"There's been one call already," De Kalb told me. "I didn't say anything. I had to think." He struck his fist into his palm impatiently and exclaimed: "I don't understand it! I saw Murray with us in that cave! I saw him!"</p>
    <p>"Has it occurred to you, Ira," Dr. Essen's gentle voice interrupted, "that what you may have seen in the time-chamber was Colonel Murray's dead body, not Colonel Murray asleep?"</p>
    <p>He turned to stare at her.</p>
    <p>"It seems clear to me," she went on, "that Mr. Cortland is a sort of catalyst in our affairs. From the moment he entered them things have speeded up rather frighteningly. I suggest it's time to make a definite forward move. What do you think, Ira?"</p>
    <p>De Kalb frowned a little. "How's Murray?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"He's dying," she said flatly. "I know of only one thing that could possibly postpone his death."</p>
    <p>"The neo-hypnosis, you mean," De Kalb said. "Well, yes -- if it works. We've used it on sleeping subjects, of course, but with a man who is as far gone as Murray, I don't know."</p>
    <p>"We can try," Dr. Essen said. "It's a chance. I don't think he'd ever have entered the time-axis of his own volition but this way we can take him along. Things are working out, Ira, very surprisingly."</p>
    <p>"Can we keep him alive until we reach the shaft?" De Kalb asked.</p>
    <p>"I think so. I can't promise but -- "</p>
    <p>"We can't save him," De Kalb said. "The People of the Face -- maybe. And after all, Murray did go with us. I saw him. Mr. Cortland do you think that plane would carry the four of us as far as the Laurentians?"</p>
    <p>"Obviously, Mr. De Kalb," I said with somewhat hysterical irony, "obviously, if I guess what you have in mind, it did!"</p>
    <p>You could see the shaft-mouth from a long way up, dark above the paler slide of dug earth, and shadowed by the thick green of the Canadian mountains.</p>
    <p>It was easier to spot from the air than to reach on foot.</p>
    <p>We left the plane in a little clearing at the bottom of the slope. It seemed wildly reckless, but what else could we do? And we carried Murray's body up the mountain with us, De Kalb and I, while Dr. Essen, carrying a square case about two feet through, kept a watchful eye on the unconscious man. Once she had to administer adrenalin to Murray.</p>
    <p>I still hadn't come to any decision. I could simply have walked away but that would have meant shutting the last door of escape behind me. I told myself that I'd think of some other way before the final decision had to be made. Meanwhile I went with the others.</p>
    <p>"It wouldn't be as though I were running away from punishment," I told De Kalb wryly as we paused to catch our breath on the lip of the shaft. Tree-tops swayed and murmured below us, and the mountains were warm in the late, slanting sunlight of a summer evening.</p>
    <p>"If your theories are right I won't be escaping from anything. The moment I step into your time-trap my alter ego steps out and goes on down the mountain to take his medicine. All I can say is I hope he has a fine alibi ready."</p>
    <p>"He will have -- we will have," De Kalb said. "We'll have all time at our disposal to think one up in. Remember what our real danger is, Cortland -- the nekron. An infection of the mind. An infection of the earth itself and perhaps an infection in our own flesh, yours and mine.</p>
    <p>"What it is that I turned loose on the world when I opened that box I don't yet know but I expect to know when I go down that mountain again -- ten minutes from now, a million years from now. Both." He shook his head.</p>
    <p>"Let's get on with it," he said.</p>

     <p>8. FANTASTIC JOURNEY</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>I don't think I ever really meant to embark on that fantastic journey along the time axis. I helped carry Colonel Murray's body down the dusty shaft but it was a nightmare I walked through, not a real experience. I knew at the bottom of the tunnel I'd wake up in my hotel in Rio.</p>
    <p>At the foot of the shaft was a hollowed out room. Our flash-beams moved searchingly across the rough walls. We carried Murray into the cave and laid him down gently on a spot the scientist indicated, Dr. Essen immediately became busy with her patient. Presently she looked up and nodded reassuringly.</p>
    <p>"There's time," she said.</p>
    <p>But De Kalb waved his arm, sending light sliding erratically up the rock, and said, "Time -- there is time here! This space and this air form one immutable axis upon which all the past and the future turn like a wheel."</p>
    <p>It was bombastic but it was impressive too. Dr. Essen and I were silent, trying to grasp that imponderable concept, trying perhaps to catch the sound of that vast turning. But De Kalb had moved into action.</p>
    <p>"Now," he said, kneeling beside the black suitcase Dr. Essen had set down. "Now you shall see. Murray is all right for a while? Then -- " He snapped open the case and laid down its four sides so that the compact instruments within stood up alone, light catching in their steel surfaces.</p>
    <p>He squatted down and began to unpack them, to set up from among part of the shining things a curious little structure like a tree of glass and blinking lights, fitting tiny jointed rods together, screwing bulbs like infinitesimal soap-bubbles into invisible sockets.</p>
    <p>"Now, Letta," he said presently, squinting up at her in the dusty flash-beams, "your turn."</p>
    <p>"Ira -- " She hesitated, shrugged uneasily. "Very well."</p>
    <p>I held the light for them while they worked.</p>
    <p>After what seemed a long while De Kalb grunted and sat back on his heels. There was a thin, very high singing noise and the tiny tree began to move. I let my flashlight sink upon my knee. De Kalb reached over and switched it off. Dr. Essen's beam blinked out with a soft click. It was dark except for the slowly quickening spin of the tree, the flicker of its infinitesimal lights.</p>
    <p>Very gradually it seemed to me that a gray brightness was beginning to dawn around us, almost as if the whirling tree threw off light that was tangible and accumulated in the dusty air, hanging there upon every mote of dust, spinning a web that grew and grew.</p>
    <p>It was gathering in an egg-shaped oval that nearly filled the chamber.</p>
    <p>By the gray luminous dimness I could see Dr. Essen with her hands on a flat thick sheet of metal which she held across her knees. There were raised bars of wire across its upper surface and she seemed almost to be playing it like a musical instrument as her fingers moved over the bars. There was no sound but the light slowly, very slowly, broadened around us.</p>
    <p>"In theory," Dr. Essen said, "this would have worked years ago. But in practice, only this very special type of space provides the conditions we need. I published some papers in Forty-one on special atomic structures and the maintenance of artificial matrix. But the displacement due to temporal movement made practical application impossible. Only at the time-axis would that displacement theory became invalid.</p>
    <p>"I am creating a rigid framework of matter now. Call it a matrix, except that the vibratory period is automatically adaptive, so that it's self-perpetuating and can't be harmed. Really, the practical application would be something like this -- if you were driving a car and saw another car -- about to collide with you, your own vehicle could automatically adjust its structure and become intangible. So -- "</p>
    <p>"It isn't necessary for Mr. Cortland to understand this," De Kalb said, his voice suddenly almost gay. "Eager seeker after truth though he may be. There is still much I don't understand. We go into terra incognita -- but I think we will come to the Face in the end.</p>
    <p>"Somehow, against apparent logic, we have managed to follow the rules of the game. Somehow events have arranged themselves -- in an unlikely fashion -- so that all four of us are entering the time axis where all four of us lie asleep -- intangible, impalpable and invisible except under ultraviolet.</p>
    <p>"Murray may die. But since the nekronic creature attacked through time, as I believe, then perhaps sympathetic medicine may cure the Colonel. Some poisons kill but cure in larger doses. I don't know. Perhaps the long catalepsy outside time will enable Murray's wound to heal -- wherever it is. I suspect that the people of the Face may have foreseen all this. Are you getting drowsy, Mr. Cortland?"</p>
    <p>I was. The softly whirling tree, the sweet, thin, monotonous sound of its turning were very effective hypnotics though I hadn't realized it fully till now. I made a sudden convulsive effort to rise. On the very verge of the plunge I realized that my decision had been made for me.</p>
    <p>I felt my nerve going. I didn't want to embark on this crazy endeavor at all. A suicide must know this last instant of violent revulsion the moment after he has pulled the trigger or swallowed the poison. I put out every ounce of energy I had -- and moved with infinite sluggishness, perhaps a quarter of an inch from where I sat.</p>
    <p>De Kalb's voice said, "No, no. The matrix has formed." My head was ringing.</p>
    <p>The gray light was like a web that sealed my eyes. Through it, dimly, remotedly, far off in space and time, I thought I could see motion stirring that was not our motion -- and perhaps was --</p>
    <p>And perhaps was ourselves, at the other end of the closing temporal circle, rising from sleep after adventures a million years in the future, a million years in the past. But that motion was wholly theirs. I could not stir.</p>
    <p>Sealed in sleep, sealed in time, I felt my consciousness sinking down like a candleflame, like a sinking fountain, down and down to the levels below awareness.</p>
    <p>The next thing I saw, I told myself out of that infinite drowsiness, would be the Face of Ea looking out over the red twilight of the world's end. And then the flame went out, the fountain sank back upon the dark wellspring of its origin far below the surfaces of the mind.</p>
    <p>"And now we wait," De Kalb's voice said, ghostly, infinities away. "Now we wait -- a million years."</p>

     <p>9. STRANGE AWAKENING</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>There was a rhythmic ebb and flow of waves on some murmurous shore. It must, I thought, be part of my dream.</p>
    <p>Dream?</p>
    <p>I couldn't remember. The murmur was a voice, but the things it said seemed to slip by over the surface of my mind without waking any ripples of comprehension. Sight? I could see nothing. There was movement somewhere, but meaningless movement. Feeling? Perhaps a mild warmth, no more. Only the voice, very low -- unless, after all, it were some musical instrument.</p>
    <p>But it spoke in English.</p>
    <p>Had I been capable of surprise that should have surprised me. But I was not. I was utterly passive. I let sensations come and go in the darkness that lay just beyond me, on the other side of that wall of the silenced senses. What world? What time? What people? It didn't matter yet.</p>
    <p>" -- of waiting here so long," the voice said on a minor chord of sadness so intensely sweet that my throat seemed to tighten in response. Then it changed. It pleased -- and I knew even in my stupor that no one of flesh and blood could possibly deny whatever that strange sweet voice demanded. "So I may go now, Lord? Oh, please, please let me go!" The English was curious, at once archaic and evolved. "An hour's refreshment in the Swan Garden," the plaintive voice urged, "and I shan't droop so." Then a sigh, musical with a deliberate lilt.</p>
    <p>"My hair -- look at it, Lord! The sparkles all gone, all gone. Poor sparkles! But only an hour in the Swan Gardens and I'll serve you again. May I go, Lord? May I go?"</p>
    <p>No one could have denied her. I lay there enthralled by the sheer music of that voice. It was like the shock of icy water in the face to hear a man's brisk voice reply.</p>
    <p>"Save your tongue, save your tongue. And don't flatter me with the name of Lord. This is business."</p>
    <p>"But so many hours already -- I'll die, I know I'll die! You can't be so cruel -- and I'll call you Lord anyhow. Why not? You are my Lord now, since you have the power to let me live or -- " Heart-rending sorrow breathed in the sigh she gave.</p>
    <p>"My poor hair," she said. "The stars are quite gone out of it now. Oh, how hideous I am! The sight of me when he wakes will be too dreadful, Lord! Let me take one little hour in the Swan Garden and -- "</p>
    <p>"Be quiet. I want to think."</p>
    <p>There was silence for a moment or two. Then the sweet voice murmured something in a totally unfamiliar language, sullenly. The man said, "You know the rules, don't you?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, Lord. I'm sorry."</p>
    <p>"No more impudence, then. I know impudence, even when I can't understand it. Pay attention to me now. I'm going to put an end to this session. When this man wakes bring him -- "</p>
    <p>"To the Swan Garden? Oh, Lord Paynter, now? I will love you forever!"</p>
    <p>"It isn't necessary," the crisp voice said, "Just bring him to the right station. The City's the nearest connection since this is confidential so far. Do you understand?"</p>
    <p>"The City? Walk through the City? I'll die before I've gone a dozen steps. My poor slippers -- oh, Lord Paynter, why not direct transmission?"</p>
    <p>"You'll have new slippers if you need them. I don't want to remind you again all this is secret work. We don't want anybody tuning in accidentally on our wave-length. The transmitter in the City has the right wave-band, so you can bring him -- "</p>
    <p>His voice trailed off. The girl's tones interrupted, dying away in the distance in a faint, infinitely pitiable murmuring quaver. There was a pause, then the sound of light feet returning on some hard surface and a rush of laughter like a spurt of bright fountaining water.</p>
    <p>"Old fool," she said, and laughed again. "If you think I care -- " The words changed and were again incomprehensible, in some language I had never heard even approximated before.</p>
    <p>Then movement came, and light -- a brief, racking vertigo wrenched my brain around,</p>
    <p>I opened my eyes and looked up into the face of the girl, and logic was perfectly useless after that. Later I understood why, knew what she was and why men's hearts moved at the sight and sound of her. But then it was enough to see that flawless face, the lovely curve of her lips, the eyes that shifted from one hue to another, the hyacinth hair where the last stars pulsed and died.</p>
    <p>She was bending over me, the tips of her scented ringlets brushing my shoulder. Her voice was inhumanly sweet, and so soft with warmth and reassurance that all my bewilderment melted away. It didn't matter where I was or what had happened, so long as that lovely voice and that lovely face were near -- which was exactly the effect she had meant to make and exactly the reason why she was there. I knew her face.</p>
    <p>At that moment I was not even trying to reason things out. My tongue felt thick and my mind was lightly furred all over with the effects of what? Sleep? Some drug they might have given me while I lay there helpless? I didn't know. I accepted all that was happening with a mindless acquiescence. Later I would wonder. Now I only stared up at the lovely, familiar face and listened to the lovely, familiar face and listened to the lovely, remotely familiar voice.</p>
    <p>"You're all right now," she was murmuring, her changing eyes on mine. "Quite all right. Don't be worried. Do you feel strong enough yet to sit up? I have something I want you to see."</p>
    <p>I got an elbow under me and levered myself slowly up, the girl helping. I looked around.</p>
    <p>I was dressed in unfamiliar dark garments and I was sitting on a low couch apparently composed of a solid block of some hard yet resilient substance. We were alone together in a smallish room whose walls looked like the couch, hard yet faintly translucent, just a little yielding to the touch. Everything had the same color, a soft graylike mist or -- I thought dimly -- sleep itself, the color of sleep.</p>
    <p>The girl was the color of -- sunlight, perhaps. Her smooth skin had an apricot glow and her gown was of thin, thin silky stuff, pale yellow, like layers of veiling that floated when she moved. There were still a few fading sparkles in her curls. Her eyes just now were a clear bright blue that darkened as I met them to something close to violet.</p>
    <p>"Look," she said. "Over there, behind you, on the wall."</p>
    <p>I turned on the couch and looked. The far wall had a circular opening in it. Beyond the opening I could see rough rock walls, a grayish glow of light, four figures lying motionless on the dusty floor. For a moment it meant nothing to me. My mind was still dim with sleep. Then --</p>
    <p>"The cave!" I said suddenly. And of course, it was. That little glittering tree which was the last thing I had seen before sleep overtook me stood there, motionless now. Beside it lay De Kalb.</p>
    <p>Dr. Essen slumbered beyond him, the flat metal sheet with the bars of wire still leaning against her knee. She lay on her side, the tired, gentle face half hidden by her bent arm, the gray curls on the dusty floor. There was a rather unexpected gracefulness to her angular body as she lay there, utterly relaxed in a sleep that was already -- how many thousands of years long?</p>
    <p>My eyes lingered for an instant on her face, moved on to Murray's motionless body, moved back again to search the woman's half-hidden features for a disturbing something I could not quite identify. It was -- it was --</p>
    <p>The figure beyond Murray's caught my attention suddenly and for an instant my mind went blank with amazement. The puzzle of Dr. Essen's face vanished in this larger surprise, the incredible identity of that fourth person asleep in the dusty cave. I gaped, speechless and without thought.</p>
    <p>Up to that instant I suppose I had been assuming simply that all of us were being awakened, slowly and with difficulty, and that I had awakened first. But the fourth person asleep on the cavern floor was Jeremy Cortland. Jerry Cortland -- me.</p>
    <p>I got to my feet unsteadily, finding after a moment or two that I was in fairly good control of all my faculties. The girl twittered in concern.</p>
    <p>"I'm all right," I said. "But I'm still there!"</p>
    <p>Then I paused. "That means the others may have wakened too. De Kalb -- Dr. Essen -- have they -- ?"</p>
    <p>She hesitated. "Only you are awake," she said at last.</p>
    <p>I walked on slightly uncertain feet across the floor and peered into the cave. There was no cave.</p>
    <p>I knew it when I was close to the wall. I could see the light reflected slightly on the texture of the surface. The cave was only another reflection, television perhaps, or something more obscure, but with startlingly convincing depth and clarity.</p>
    <p>And if that scene was separated from me in space it might be distant in time as well -- I might be seeing a picture of something hours or weeks old. It was an unpleasant moment, that. So long as I thought myself near to that last familiar link with my own world I had maintained a certain confidence that broke abruptly now. I looked around a little wildly at the girl.</p>
    <p>"I'm not in that cave now -- they're not there now either, are they? This was just a picture that was taken before any of us woke. Did you wake first, then?" It was no good. I knew that. I rubbed my hand across my face and said, "Sorry. What did happen?"</p>

     <p>10. MUSEUM</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>She smiled dazzlingly. And for one flash of an instant I knew who she was. I knew why my eyes had been drawn back in puzzled surprise to Letta Essen lying with curious unexpected grace on the cavern floor.</p>
    <p>I met this girl's shining gaze and for that one instant knew I was looking straight into the keen gray eyes of Letta Essen.</p>
    <p>The moment of certainty passed in a flash. The girl's eyes shifted from gray to luminous blue, the long lashes fell and the unmistakable identity of a woman I knew vanished. But the likeness remained. The familiarity remained. This girl was Letta Essen.</p>
    <p>My mind, groping for similes, seized at first on the theory that in some fantastic way Dr. Essen herself stood here before me masked by some science of beauty beyond the sciences I knew, in a shell of youth and loveliness through which only her keen gaze showed.</p>
    <p>It was all a trick, I thought -- this is Letta Essen who did wake before me, somehow leaving her simulacrum there in the cave, as I had. This is Letta Essen in some amazingly lovely disguise for purposes of her own and she'll speak in a moment and confess. But it couldn't have been a disguise. This soft young loveliness was no mask. It was the girl herself. And her features were the features Letta Essen might have had twenty years ago if she had lived a wholly different life, a life as dedicated to beauty as Dr. Essen's had been to science.</p>
    <p>Then I caught a bewildering gray flash again and I knew it was Letta Essen -- no disguise, no variation on the features such as kinship or remote descent might account for. The mind is individual and unique. There are no duplications of the personality. I knew I was looking into the eyes of Letta Essen herself, no matter how impossible it seemed.</p>
    <p>"Dr. Essen?" I said softly. "Dr. Essen?"</p>
    <p>She laughed. "You're still dreaming," she said. "Do you feel better now? Lord Paynter -- the old fool -- is waiting for us. We should hurry."</p>
    <p>I only gaped at her. What could I say? If she wasn't ready to explain how could I force her to speak? And yet I knew.</p>
    <p>"I'm here to welcome you, of course," she said lightly, speaking exactly as if I were some stranger to whom she must be polite, but who was of no real interest to her. "I was trained for work like this -- to make people feel at ease. All this is a great mystery but -- well, Lord Paynter will have to explain. I'm only an entertainer. But a very good one. Oh, very good.</p>
    <p>"Lord Paynter sent for me when he knew you would awaken. He thought his own ugly face might put you into such a mood you'd never answer any questions." She giggled. "At least, I hope he thought so." She paused, regarding me with exactly the cool keen speculative stare I had so often met when the woman before me was Letta Essen. Then she shrugged.</p>
    <p>"He'll tell you as much as you ought to know, I suppose. It's all much too mystifying for me." Her glance shifted to the cavern where the sleepers lay motionless and I thought there was bewilderment in her eyes as she looked uneasily from face to sleeping face. Again she shrugged.</p>
    <p>"Well, we should go. If we're late Lord Paynter will have me beaten." She seemed very unconcerned about the prospect. "And please don't ask questions," she added, "for I'm not allowed to answer. Even if I knew the answers. Even if I cared."</p>
    <p>I was watching her with such urgent attention that my eyes ached with the effort of trying to be more than eyes, trying to pierce through her unconcern and see into the depths of the mind which I was certain was Letta Essen's. She smiled carelessly at me and turned away.</p>
    <p>"Come along," she said.</p>
    <p>There was nothing for me to do but obey. Clearly I was expected to play the same game her actions indicated. With some irony I said, "You can tell me your name, can't you?"</p>
    <p>"I am Topaz -- this week," she said. "Next week, perhaps -- something else. But you may think of me until then as Topaz."</p>
    <p>"Thanks," I said dryly. "And what year are you Topaz in? What country? Where am I, anyhow?"</p>
    <p>"The Lord Paynter will tell you that. I don't care to be beaten."</p>
    <p>"But you speak English. I can't be very far from home."</p>
    <p>"Oh, everyone who matters knows English. It's the court language of the Mother Planet, you see. The whole galaxy operates on an English basic. There has to be some common language. I -- oh dear, I will be beaten! Come along."</p>
    <p>She turned away, tugging me by the arm. There was a button on the opposite wall and the way she walked beside me toward it, the way she reached to touch the button, followed so definite a pattern of graceful motion that it seemed like dancing.</p>
    <p>In the wall a shutter widened. Topaz turned. "This is the City," she told me.</p>
    <p>I had seen the beginnings of such places in my own time. In the second level under Chicago, by the canal -- at Hoover Dam -- in the great bridges and the subways of Manhattan. Those had been the rudiments, ugly, crude, harsh. This was a city of machines, a city of metal with blood of invisible energy.</p>
    <p>Ugly? No. But frightening -- yes.</p>
    <p>Topaz led me across a strip of pavement to a cushioned car like a big cup and we sat down in it and the car started, whether or not on wheels I can't say. It moved in three dimensions, rising sharply in the air sometimes to avoid collisions, to thread its intricate pattern through that singing city.</p>
    <p>The sound was, perhaps, the strangest part. I kept watching and listening with the automatic attention of the reporter, senselessly making mental notes for articles I would never write. A single note hummed through the city, clear and loud as a trumpet, sliding up and down the scale. Not music, for there was no pattern, but much like a clarinet, varied every changing second.</p>
    <p>I asked Topaz about it. She gave me a glance from Letta.</p>
    <p>Essen's eyes and said, "Oh, that's to make the noise bearable. You can't get rid of the noise, you know, without sacrificing the effect but you can transform it into harmonious sound that does convey the proper things. There's -- what do you call it -- frequency modulation. I think that's it.</p>
    <p>"All the noises of the City every second add up to one key vibration, a non-harmonic, and that's simply augmented by a machine so the audible result isn't so unpleasant. The only alternative would be to blanket it completely and that would mean sacrificing a good part of the total effect, you know."</p>
    <p>"I don't know," I said. "What do you mean, effect?"</p>
    <p>She turned in the car to look at me. Suddenly she dimpled.</p>
    <p>"No, I see you don't understand. Well, I won't explain. I'll save it for a surprise."</p>
    <p>I didn't argue with her. I was too busy staring around me at the City. I can't describe it. I won't try and I don't need to. You've read about such places, maybe pictured them for yourself. Precision, perfect functionalism, all one mighty machine made up of machines.</p>
    <p>There were no humans, no life, except for us under the dome of steel sky. The light was gray, clear, oddly compact, and through that steel-colored air the city trumpeted its wailing cry of a world that was not my world, a time that was yet to come.</p>
    <p>Where was the red twilight of the world's end? Where was the Face of Ea, from which the call for help had come.</p>
    <p>Or did that world lie somewhere just outside the city? Something had gone strangely wrong in the time-axis -- that much was certain. If I let myself think about it I'd probably start gibbering. Things had been taken out of my control and all I could do was ride along.</p>
    <p>We drew up before a towering steel and plastic building. Topaz jumped briskly out of the car, took my hand confidently and led me into the low door before us. We had stepped straight into an elevator apparently, for a panel sighed shut behind us and I felt the familiar pressure underfoot and the displaced air that means a rapid rising up a shaft.</p>
    <p>The panel opened. We stepped out into a small room similar to the one in which I had awakened.</p>
    <p>"Now," Topaz said with relief. "We're here. You were very good and didn't ask too many questions, so before we go I'll show you something."</p>
    <p>She touched another button in the wall, and a plate of metal slid downward out of sight. There was thick glass behind it. Topaz fingered the button again and the glass slid down in turn. A gust of sweet-smelling air blew in upon us. I caught my breath and leaned forward to stare.</p>
    <p>We were very high up in the city but we were looking out over a blossoming countryside, bright in the season of late spring. I saw meadows deep in grass and yellow flowers, far below. Streams winked in the bright, clear sunlight, here and there fruit-trees were in blossom. Bird-song rose and fell in the sunshine.</p>
    <p>"This of course," Topaz said, "is the world we live in. There's only one museum."</p>
    <p>"Museum?" I echoed almost absently, "What museum?"</p>
    <p>"The City. There's only one. All machines and robots. Isn't it horrible? They built like that, you know, back in barbarous times. We keep it in operation to show what it was like. That's why they can't blanket the noises altogether, it would spoil the effect. But no one lives here. Only students come sometimes. Our world is out there."</p>
    <p>"But where do people live?" I asked. "Not in -- well, villages, communities?"</p>
    <p>"Oh no. Not any more. Not since the dark ages. We have transmission now, you see, so we don't need to live huddled up together."</p>
    <p>"Transmission?"</p>
    <p>"This is a transmitter." She waved at the room behind us. "That other place, where you woke, was a receiver."</p>
    <p>"Receiver of what? Transmitter of what?" I felt like Alice talking to the Caterpillar,</p>
    <p>"Of matter, naturally. Much easier than walking." She pressed the stud again and the glass and metal slid up to shut out that glowing springtime world. "Now," she said, "We'll go -- wherever it is we're going. I don't know. Lord Paynter -- "</p>
    <p>"I know -- the old fool."</p>
    <p>Topaz giggled. "Lord Paynter's orders are already on record. In a moment we'll see." She did domething with the buttons on the wall. "Here we go," she said.</p>
    <p>Vertigo spun through my mind. The wailing of that ancient, wonderful, monstrous City died away.</p>

     <p>11. THIRTY SECOND INTERLUDE</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>It was a little like going down fast in an elevator. I didn't lose consciousness but the physical sensations of transmission were so bewildering and so disorienting that I might as well have been unconscious for all the details I could give -- then or later -- about what happens between transmitter and receiver. All I know is that for a while the walls shimmered around me and gravity seemed to let go abruptly inside my body, so that I was briefly very dizzy.</p>
    <p>Then, without any perceptible spatial change at all, the walls suddenly steadied and were not translucent pale gray any more, but hard dull steel, with the rivets showing where plates overlapped and here and there a streak of rust. I was in a somewhat smaller room than before. And I was alone.</p>
    <p>"Topaz?" I said tentatively, looking around for her. "Topaz?" And then, more loudly, "Dr. Essen -- where are you?"</p>
    <p>No answer, except for the echo of my voice from those dull rusty walls.</p>
    <p>This time it was harder to take, I don't know why. Maybe things like that are cumulative. It was the second time I'd taken a jump into the unknown, piloted by somebody who was supposed to know the angles, and come out at the far end alone and in the wrong place.</p>
    <p>I looked at the walls and fought down sheer panic at the possibility that this time I had really gone astray in the time-dimension and wakened here in the same room from which I'd set out in the City museum, a room now so aged that the wall surfaces had worn away and the exposed steel corroded and only I remained alive and imprisoned in a dead world.</p>
    <p>It was a bad moment.</p>
    <p>I had to do something to disprove the idea. Obviously the one possible action was to get out of there. I took a long step toward the nearest wall --</p>
    <p>And found myself staggering. Gravity had gone wrong again. I weighed too much. My knees were trying to buckle, as if the one step had put nearly double my weight upon them. I braced my legs and made it to the wall in wide, plodding steps, compensating in every muscle for that extraordinary downward pull.</p>
    <p>The moment my hand touched the wall there was a noise of badly oiled hinges and a door slid back in the steel.</p>
    <p>Now let me get this straight.</p>
    <p>Everything that happened happened extremely fast. It was only later that I realized it, because I had no sense of being hurried. But in the next thirty seconds the most important thing that was to occur in that world, so far as I was concerned, took place with great speed and precision.</p>
    <p>Through the opening came a cool dusty light and the sound of buzzing, soft and insistent. I guessed at anything and everything.</p>
    <p>I stood on the threshold of an enormous room. It was braced, tremendously braced, with rusted and pitted girders so heavy they made me think of Karnak and the tremendous architecture of the Egyptians. In an intricate series of webs and meshes metal girders ran through the great room, catwalks, but perhaps not for human beings, since some were level while others tilted dizzily and on a few one would have had to walk upside-down. I noticed, though, that while most of the catwalks were rusted those on which a man could walk without slipping off were scuffed shiny.</p>
    <p>There was a series of broad high windows all around the room. Through them I could see a city.</p>
    <p>Topaz had said there were no cities in her civilization except for the Museum. Well, perhaps there weren't. Perhaps I had plunged unknowingly into time again, and looked upon a city like that Museum, no longer preserved in dead perfection. This city was living and very old. An obsolete metropolis, perhaps a nekropolis in the sense De Kalb had used the term. Everywhere was decay, rust, broken buildings, dim lights.</p>
    <p>The sky was black. But it was day outside, a strange, pallid day lit by bands of thin light that lay like a borealis across the dark heavens. Far off, bright but not blinding, a double sun turned in the blackness.</p>
    <p>But there were people on the streets. My confidence came back a little at the sight of them, until I realized that something curious was taking place all through the city as I watched a strange, phantom-like flitting of figures -- men flashing into sight and out again like apparitions in folklore. I stared, bewildered, for an instant, before I realized the answer.</p>
    <p>Perhaps in a city of the future like this one I had expected vehicles or moving ways of endless belts. Now I saw that at intervals along the street were discs of dull metal set in the pavement. A man would step on one -- and vanish. Another man would suddenly appear on another, step off and hurry toward a third disc.</p>
    <p>It was matter-transmission, applied to the thoroughly practical use of quick transportation.</p>
    <p>I saw other things in that one quick look about the city. I won't detail them. The fact of the city itself is all that was important about that phase of my thirty seconds' experience there.</p>
    <p>There were two other important things. One was the activity going on in the enormous room itself. And the third was waiting almost at my elbow. But I'm taking these in the reverse order of their urgency.</p>
    <p>Something was happening on the far side of the room. It wasn't easy to see, because of the distance and because a number of men in dark close-fitting garments clustered around it. I thought it might be an autopsy.</p>
    <p>There was a table as high as an operating table and a man or a body lay stretched out on it. Above the table hung a web of thin, shining, tenuous matter that might have been lights or wires. It made me think, for no clear reason, of a complex chart of the neural system.</p>
    <p>At the lower edge the bright lines appeared to connect with the object on the table. At the top they vanished into a maze of ceiling connections I couldn't follow. Some of the wires, or lights, were brilliantly colored, others were silvery. Light and color flowed along them, coalesced at intersections, glowed dazzlingly and flowed on along diverse channels downward.</p>
    <p>That was the thing of secondary importance which I saw there. The thing of primary importance stood about six feet away from me, waiting.</p>
    <p>Now this is the difficult part. I must get it as clear as I can.</p>
    <p>A tall man stood facing me. He had been standing there when the door opened. Obviously he expected me. He wore tight-fitting dark clothes like the others. He was well-made, even handsome, with the emotionless face of a Greek statue or a Buddha.</p>
    <p>He was Ira De Kalb.</p>
    <p>I had a moment of horrible internal vertigo, as if the bottom had dropped wholly out of my reason. It couldn't be happening. For this was De Kalb and it wasn't, exactly as Topaz had been Dr. Essen -- and not Dr. Essen. In this case, at any rate, there was almost no physical difference. This man before me was the man I had last seen asleep in the cavern of the time-axis, no younger, no older, not changed at all except for one small thing.</p>
    <p>The Ira De Kalb I had known possessed strange veiled eyes, filmed like a bird's, grayed with light blue dullness. But this De Kalb, who regarded me with unrecognizing coldness, as if he had never seen me before in his life, looked out of curiously changed eyes.</p>
    <p>His eyes were made of metal.</p>
    <p>It was living metal, like burnished steel with depth behind it, yet not real steel -- some alloy unknown to me, some bright unstable thing like quicksilver. I could see my own face reflected in the eyes, very small and vivid, and as my reflection moved, the eyes moved too.</p>
    <p>I took a deep breath and opened my mouth to speak his name.</p>
    <p>But I did not make a sound. There wasn't time. He had been standing there with an immobility that was not human. An image of metal would stand like that, not seeming to breathe, no tiniest random motion stirring it. And I had an instant's uncanny recollection that the De Kalb I knew had moved with curious clumsiness, like an automaton.</p>
    <p>Then the metal eyes moved.</p>
    <p>No, I moved.</p>
    <p>It was a fall, in a way. But no fall I could accurately describe. It was motion of abnormal motor impulses, fantastic simply because they were without precedent. One walks, actually, in a succession of forward-falling movements, the legs automatically swinging forward to save one from collapse toward the center of gravity.</p>
    <p>This was reaction to a sort of warped gravitational pull that drew me toward De Kalb. It was the opposite of paralysis -- a new gravitation had appeared and I was falling toward it. It was like rushing down a steep slope, unable to halt oneself.</p>
    <p>His strange, smooth face was expressionless but the metal eyes moved, watching me, reflecting my twin images that grew larger and larger as I fell upon him down a vertiginous abyss. The eyes came toward me with an effect of terrible hypnosis, probing into mine, stabbing through the reflection of my own face, my own eyes, and pinning the brain in my skull -- probing into my mind and the little chamber behind the mind, where the ego lives.</p>
    <p>Then he was looking out -- through my own eyes! Deep in my brain the metal gaze crouched, looking watchfully outward, seeing what I saw.</p>
    <p>A telepathic rapport? I couldn't explain it. All I knew was the fact. De Kalb was a spy in my brain now.</p>
    <p>I turned around. I went back toward the door into the transmission room. I closed the door. I was alone there. But the metal eyes looked at the room as I looked at it. I had no control over my motions while I saw my own hand rise and finger the wall. But when the room began to shimmer and the disorientation of matter-transmission shivered through my body I knew I had my muscles and my will back again. I was free to move as I liked. I was free to think and speak. But not about what had just happened. It may have been something like post-hypnotic command, to give it a label. That's easy for me. Remember, I'd looked into De Kalb's quicksilver eyes.</p>
    <p>All this happened in something under thirty seconds. I've given you, of course, conclusions and afterthoughts that came to me much later, when I had time to think over what I'd seen and correlate it. But I woke in the rusted room, I looked out into a city on a planet outside our solar system, I saw something like an autopsy in a vast laboratory braced as if to withstand unearthly pressures, I met the gaze of Ira De Kalb and then the thing had happened between us -- happened. And I returned to the transmitter.</p>
    <p>The room vibrated and vanished.</p>

     <p>12. THE SWAN GARDEN</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Topaz squealed with sheer delight.</p>
    <p>"Come on out!" she cried. "It's the Swan Garden! What are you waiting for anyhow? I'll take back all I ever said about Lord Paynter. Oh, do look, isn't it wonderful here?"</p>
    <p>Silently I stepped after her through the door.</p>
    <p>So little actual time had elapsed that I don't think she really missed me. Something had reached out through the matter-transmitter and intercepted one of us and let the other go on. But Topaz must have rushed out of the door the moment it opened and been too overcome with pleasure at finding herself just here to realize I was lagging behind.</p>
    <p>And I -- had I really been for a round-trip through a galaxy? Had I dreamed it? Was this whole interlude a dream while my own body slept in the time-axis, waiting for the world's end? In preparation for that sleep I had begun to learn how to ignore time as a factor in our plans.</p>
    <p>In this world, waking or sleeping, evidently I must learn to ignore space. Distance meant nothing here with the matter-transmitters functioning as they did. You could live on Centaurus and get your breakfast rolls fresh from a bakery in Chicago.</p>
    <p>You could drop in on a friend on Sirius to borrow a book, simply because it might be easier than to walk around the corner for one. And in the annihilation of space, time too seemed to undergo a certain annihilation. Just as, in ignoring time, you could as a corollary overstep space.</p>
    <p>I had overstepped reason too. I had come into a world where nothing made sense to me, where the people who had been my companions moved behind masks, stirred by motives that were gibberish. I had overstepped both space and time just now, and so compactly that the girl who called herself Topaz never missed me.</p>
    <p>I was still too dazed to argue. I could control my own motions again but my mind had suffered too much bewilderment to function very well. I followed Topaz dumbly, staring about me at the remarkable landscape of the Swan Garden -- knowing in some indescribable way that inside my mind other eyes stared too, impassive metal eyes that watched my thoughts as they watched the things around me.</p>
    <p>Topaz spun around twice in sheer delight, her sun-colored veils flying. Then she ran her hands through her hair, dislodging a last sparkle or two, and, smiling at me over her shoulder, beckoned and hurried ahead through what seemed to be a wall of white lace.</p>
    <p>A gentle breeze stirred it, shivering the folds together and I saw that we were following a narrow path through a grove of head-high growths like palmetto, except that the leaves and flowers were white, and shaped like enormous snow-flakes, each a perfect crystalline pattern and every one different from every other.</p>
    <p>Topaz ran her hands lovingly through the flowers as we went down the path. Underfoot the ground had the look and feel of soft down. After a moment we entered a cleared space with what seemed at first glance a stream of water tracing an arabesque path among huge, humped boulders. The breeze freshened, the lacy curtains shimmered and thinned before it and I saw a gossamer vista beyond of unreal gardens where fantastic beauties lay in wait.</p>
    <p>"Sit down," Topaz said. "I don't know why Lord Paynter sent us here but I suppose he'll join us when he's ready. Isn't it lovely? Now I can have my hair starred again. Oh, do sit down! Right there, on that -- "</p>
    <p>"That rock?" I asked.</p>
    <p>"No, that chair. Look." She sank lightly on one of the boulders and it curved and moulded itself beneath her to a couch the shape of her body, fitting every bend of her limbs perfectly. It looked very comfortable.</p>
    <p>I grinned at her and sat down myself, feeling thick, resilent softness yielding as I sank. Deliberately I turned off my mind. Events wholly beyond my control had catapulted me into this world and this complex situation.</p>
    <p>The only way I could keep sane was to ride along without a struggle until the time for action came. I thought I'd know it when it did. There was no use asking questions of this lovely deliberately feather-brained little creature beside me. Perhaps, when Paynter came --</p>
    <p>"Have some fruit," Topaz invited, gesturing at the stream flowing past.</p>
    <p>I looked again. It wasn't a stream. Call it a tube, of flowing crystal, hanging unsupported in the air about three feet off the ground. It came out of the downy earth at the edge of the trees, twisted intricately around the boulders and dived into the ground again farther on. From where I sat I could touch one arch of it without stretching.</p>
    <p>Drifting past my hand came a globe, large as an orange, of a pale green translucence. Topaz put out her hand, waited for it to drift nearer, plucked it out of the stream. She gave it to me, cool and dripping from its bath.</p>
    <p>"Eat it if you like," she said. "Choose what you will. I'm going away for awhile. Oh, I've been so good to you! Hours and hours I sat waiting for them to wake you up and my hair grew all dull and horrible." She shook her curls and her face brightened.</p>
    <p>"I'll show you," she promised. "I'll use the star-powder all over. It takes some planning, though. The stars in my hair will have to be a different color and my face -- a half-mask, do you think? A dark mask, set off by the stars? Or jet stars along my arms, like gloves."</p>
    <p>Somewhere among the trees in the direction from which we had just come a gong sounded one clear note. Topaz looked up. "Oh," she said. "Lord Paynter."</p>
    <p>I felt in the center of my mind a sudden quickening of interest. The spy who had usurped my senses was preparing for action. But -- what action?</p>
    <p>I bit into the pale green fruit Topaz had handed me.</p>
    <p>It wasn't yet my problem. If anything, it was De Kalb's. I'd have to know more before I could do a thing. I sank my teeth into crisp moist sweetness that tingled on the tongue like something mildly alcoholic. It was delicious.</p>
    <p>"Lord Paynter -- welcome to the Swan Garden!" Topaz rose from her rock and swept an elaborate and probably ironic curtsey, her bright veils billowing. "Hideous as I am," she added, "and it's all your fault, I make you welcome. I -- "</p>
    <p>"Be quiet, Topaz," a familiar voice said.</p>
    <p>I got to my feet and turned to face him as he came out from among the crystal-shaped flowers that hid the path. It was the voice I had heard in my dim awakening moments here. But seemed to me now even more familiar than that. A thin cold flat voice, a little too high. Oh yes, I had heard it before -- perhaps a thousand years before.</p>
    <p>He was a tall man, big, thick, heavy, with a fine military bearing. He had a down-drooping mouth between the flat slabs of his cheeks, very sharp pale blue eyes -- Murray's eyes, Murray's face, Murray's voice. It was Colonel Harrison Murray.</p>
    <p>It wasn't surprising, of course. So far as I knew, there might be other people in this world and there might not be. Maybe it was simply a dream, peopled by the three who still lay asleep beside me in the time-axis, dreaming as I dreamed. Only, they didn't suspect, apparently. They thought all this was real. Only I knew that the whole thing might explode like a bubble at any moment --</p>
    <p>Murray, if this were not a dream, had been healed in the long bath of time, for he looked perfectly restored now. That injury to the hidden place of the mind or the soul or the body, where the nekronic being struck, was something that could mend, then, with time. With time. Were we in the world of the Face? Had we wakened? Did we still sleep? How could I possibly find myself now in a world where Dr. Essen moved behind a mask of beauty by the name of Topaz and Murray, unchanged in any particular, called himself Paynter with a perfectly straight face, and De Kalb -- De Kalb -- what about De Kalb?</p>
    <p>I do not know.</p>
    <p>Blankly I looked around. No one had spoken. But the voice was in my brain. De Kalb? It came again.</p>
    <p>I do not know but I intend to learn. Be quiet and we will learn together.</p>
    <p>Paynter strode briskly forward, his boots ringing on the downy earth. He wore what might have been a uniform, tight-fitting, dun-colored. He gave me a keen, competent glance in which no recognition stirred, then nodded.</p>
    <p>"Good day. Hope you're feeling better. All right, men, bring the boxes over here."</p>
    <p>He stood aside and two men in uniform lugged forward a gray box the size of a small table. It had metal banding around it and a series of sockets along the top. They set a second and smaller box beside it and stood waiting.</p>
    <p>I found myself staring at them with far more interest than I felt in the boxes. Here were the first people I had seen closely, at first hand, who didn't belong in the dream. Their presence shook me a little. Perhaps it wasn't a dream then. Perhaps there really was a tangible world around us, outside this garden. Perhaps I had really awakened out of the time-axis.</p>
    <p>I turned to look at Murray -- at Paynter -- who still regarded me keenly as he sat down on one of the rubber-foam rocks. I sat down again too, watching him with new patience now. I could afford to wait. After a moment he spoke.</p>
    <p>"Topaz showed you the cave where we found you?"</p>
    <p>I nodded.</p>
    <p>"Oh yes, I did everything you ordered, Lord Paynter," Topaz contributed. "I pretended that nothing -- "</p>
    <p>"Be quiet, Topaz," Paynter said with some irritation. And then to me, "What's your name?"</p>
    <p>"Cortland," I said, and added ironically, "Lord Paynter."</p>
    <p>"Job Paynter," he corrected me calmly. "Topaz calls everybody Lord -- when she wants something. Call me Paynter. It isn't customary to use courtesy titles here."</p>
    <p>"Oh, but it is," Topaz said. She was kneeling by the stream and flicking bits of spray out of it. "Mister and Mistress and Lord and -- "</p>
    <p>"Topaz, stop playing and run away for awhile." Paynter was half irritated, half indulgent.</p>
    <p>"Oh, thank you, Lord Paynter!" She was on her feet in an instant, beaming with smiles. "My hair -- there's so much to do! Call me when you want me." She vanished among the snow-crystal trees, moving with that extraordinary grace that was as natural to her as breathing.</p>
    <p>I watched her go, seeing incongruously superimposed upon her averted face the features of Letta Essen. They were the same. I was sure of it. Imagine Letta Essen twenty years younger, with the same keen brilliance turned to deliberate irresponsibility, deliberate loveliness, and you would get -- Topaz. But a Topaz who did not seem to know she had a double.</p>
    <p>"Now, Cortland," Paynter said, putting his hands on his knees and regarding me narrowly, "we have a lot of talking to do. I've heard the playback of your conversation with Topaz when you first woke. I assume you -- ah -- believe you're from the first half of the twentieth century, right?"</p>
    <p>"You know I was asleep in the cave," I said. "You must have seen me."</p>
    <p>"I did. We analyzed the tissues and clothing of all the sleepers. Low radioactivity, so we know the sleep began before the atom wars. So that's all right. It's time-travel. We can't very well doubt that. But you'll have to tell us how the sleepers got there and how I came to be with them." He shook his head rather dazedly.</p>
    <p>I glanced around the little snow-veiled clearing where we sat. The two soldiers had finished their task and left us at a wave from -- Paynter? Topaz was gone. We were quite alone, lying back comfortably on our rubber-foam boulders, the stream gurgling faintly past us through the rocks and the air.</p>
    <p>"Maybe you can explain things now, Murray," I said. He regarded me with a sort of fixed watchfulness, alert, waiting.</p>
    <p>"Murray?" he said after a moment when I did not speak again. "Murray?"</p>
    <p>"All right -- Paynter," I conceded. "But let's have the explanation. Things are getting too far ahead of me."</p>
    <p>"I'll be glad to explain everything I can to you, in a few minutes," Paynter said, gesturing toward the gray boxes. "I don't understand what it is you're implying, though. I almost get the impression that you think you know me."</p>
    <p>"I knew a man named Murray who looked exactly like you -- if you want to play it this way," I said. "But it looks pretty obvious what happened. You and the others woke before me. You may have wakened months or years sooner. You went out into this world, whatever it is -- whenever it is -- and made places for yourselves. Now it seems to suit all of you to pretend I'm a poor relation you never heard of. That's what I think happened. Maybe you've got a better story."</p>
    <p>He exhaled noisily, a heavy sigh that was partly of impatience.</p>
    <p>"I think I see what you mean. That doubling of images confuses all of us. You really don't know, then?"</p>
    <p>"I really don't know."</p>
    <p>"Obviously, I -- or my image -- was in that cavern with yours. There was also a woman there. I didn't recognize her. The third man was Belem." He paused and fixed me with that expectant look again.</p>
    <p>"Belem," I echoed. "Where I come from we pronounce it Ira De Kalb."</p>
    <p>"Belem," he told me firmly, ignoring the feeble levity, "is a Mechandroid. He isn't human. Did you know that?"</p>

     <p>13. LORD PAYNTER'S PROBLEM</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Not human, I thought, remembering those eyes of cool metal. I sent an inward thought searching out the mind that crowded my own mind in the narrow confines of my head. Not human? I got no answer, for a moment. Then there was a whisper like a distant voice.</p>
    <p>Watch and wait, it told me quietly.</p>
    <p>"I don't know what a Mechandroid is," I said as calmly as I could. "I don't seem to know much of anything about this place. One thing I'd like to get clear -- where I'm not. Tell me, Paynter -- Murray -- whoever you are, whether you remember anything about the Face of Ea."</p>
    <p>He scowled thoughtfully. I was watching but I saw no flicker of recognition.</p>
    <p>"I can have inquiries made," he offered. "It means nothing to me, but we have colonies now on so many worlds -- "</p>
    <p>"Never mind," I said rather dizzily. "Forget it." Whether he knew or not he wasn't going to give away anything in that connection. "All right, one more thing then. What century is this?"</p>
    <p>He told me. It doesn't matter. It wasn't the time of the world's end. I was sure of that -- or as sure as I could be of anything just then. Nowhere in the galaxy yet was that red twilight or the towering Face. Something had gone wrong during our journey. Something had broken it and roused us to wakefulness too soon. Perhaps millennia too soon. And I was the only one of us who remembered at all what mission we'd set out upon.</p>
    <p>Remembered? A sudden idea struck me and I said quickly.</p>
    <p>"How about this, Paynter -- suppose you really are Murray with amnesia? You could have awakened and forgotten somehow. You might -- "</p>
    <p>"That's impossible," he said firmly, shaking his head. "I know my complete history. I was born Job Paynter, on Colchan Three, of Earth stock, fifty years ago, and I can remember a complete life. No intervals missing."</p>
    <p>"All right," I said. "You suggest something."</p>
    <p>"I wish I could. We seem to be at a stalemate. We -- "</p>
    <p>His voice suddenly went thin and dim in my ears. I felt my breath rush inward with a shuddering gasp and --</p>
    <p>Out of the past, into the secret recesses of my mind burst a familiar soundless roar of energy. Paynter and the garden behind him, were fading, insubstantial shadows. Nothing existed for a terrible blinding moment except this bursting light-speed gush of energy as --</p>
    <p>As the thing made its kill.</p>
    <p>The next thing I saw was Paynter's face. He was watching me narrowly out of hard blue eyes and it seemed to me his cheeks were curiously flushed.</p>
    <p>I don't know how long a time had elapsed. Obviously it was time enough for a report to come through, for he was speaking into an instrument on his wrist. I didn't understand the language he used. I sat there limply, too dazed still to move or think, while he watched me with that pale stare.</p>
    <p>I struggled to regain my detachment in the face of a shock that had left me sweating with plain physical fear. Somehow I had lost touch with my human companions in the long journey but it was clear that there was one fellow-traveler whom I had not lost. The creature whose track was the nekron -- the killing thing whose touch was an infection of matter itself.</p>
    <p>Paynter lowered his wrist. "Cortland," he said, "one of the men who helped set up this machine has been killed just now. Burned. It's something no one seems to have seen before -- burns of that type, I mean. You -- ah -- you seemed affected just now. Have you anything to tell me about this?"</p>
    <p>I looked at him dumbly. Then there was a stirring in my mind and the metallic gaze of the dweller there seemed to glance out through mine.</p>
    <p>That was very curious, the cold, watchful awareness that was De Kalb said calmly. Comply with Paynter now. Do as he suggests. I think I may be starting to understand.</p>
    <p>I sighed heavily. I hoped he was. Things were entirely out of my hands now. I watched Paynter take a black helmet out of the smaller box before him, plug in its cord to the larger box, hold the headpiece out to me.</p>
    <p>"Here," he said briskly. "You and I could ask one another questions until doomsday and not come nearer any understanding. This will put us in a mental rapport -- fast and complete."</p>
    <p>I looked at the thing skeptically, feeling dubious. It was all very well for De Kalb in my mind to urge compliance. How did I know what his real interests were? What Paynter's were? Certainly not the same as mine.</p>
    <p>"Let me think this over a minute," I said doubtfully. "I don't understand -- "</p>
    <p>"The control is set for certain basic problems." Paynter said in an impatient voice. "Well open our minds to each other, that's all. There's automatic screening to eliminate trivialities but everything centering around the basic of time-travel will be revealed in three seconds, much more clearly than you could possibly convey it in words. In return, I'll understand all you need to know, so that you can talk to me intelligently and won't have to stop for questions every third word. Put it on, man, put it on!"</p>
    <p>I lifted the helmet dubiously. For a moment I hesitated. Then the memory of the dead man so near us flashed vividly through my mind and I knew I had no time to lose. It might happen again. I was afraid of what Paynter might discover -- but how could I refuse now? How much had he noticed when the killer struck? Perhaps it would be better if he knew the whole story.</p>
    <p>The helmet slipped easily on my head and seemed to adjust itself automatically. Paynter was saying something about projection.</p>
    <p>"You had books in your time. In a good one there's projection -- you felt the way the author wanted you to feel. This is simply a further development. You may relive the experiences of historical persons, if the screening works out that way. I'll get certain knowledge from you, you from me -- and we draw on the projection library as a supplement, a concordance, if necessary."</p>
    <p>His fingers were busy adjusting controls. I had time enough to think, "This is the forerunning of the Record, of course. One of the steps toward something more complex."</p>
    <p>Then a bar of spinning light sprang up from the larger box, whirling so rapidly that atoms of light seemed to spiral out from it. And -- then I was somebody else.</p>
    <p>I was a guy named Bannister who'd been born after Hiroshima. I was standing in a room a mile underground. The General was sitting at his desk playing with a pistol. We were temporarily safe here, though it wasn't really safe anywhere. Still, there was a half mile of valves, Geigers and filters -- the atomic absorption stacks -- between us and the surface, so not much radiation could get in.</p>
    <p>"Let's have it," the General said,</p>
    <p>This was one war that hadn't gone by the rules. This time the top men were getting killed -- the ones who'd always died in bed before. So they were beginning to grope frantically around in Pandora's box muttering, "Where'd Hope get to?"</p>
    <p>They were beginning to find out they should have stood in bed.</p>
    <p>The Second Atomic War. I -- whoever I was -- never thought about it. I'd lived it for some years. I guess I was one of the early mental mutations, part of the social mutation that had to take place after the world began to rock like a gyroscope slowing down. I knew already I didn't think in quite the same way the older men did. Sometimes I wondered if the change, after all, meant only a keener ruthlessness.</p>
    <p>The General said, "Well? Where's the report?"</p>
    <p>"He's done it, sir," I said.</p>
    <p>The General put the pistol down on his desk and showed his teeth. "Is is practical? That's the point."</p>
    <p>"It's practical sir," I said. "Inanimate matter only, so far. But such matter can be transported for a thousand-mile radius. A receiver must be spotted first, though. It means interplanetary colonization one of these days -- because the first space-ship can take a receiver with it and open up a pipeline for supplies. This is only the start."</p>
    <p>"A matter-transmitter," the General said and suddenly crumpled the papers on his desk. "Armistice? We'll forget that now. GHQ will change its tune now we've got this new weapon."</p>
    <p>"The inventor wants to use the device for peaceful purposes, sir," I said. "I heard rumors the war was over."</p>
    <p>He looked at me. "They all do. Yes, the war was over yesterday. But well start it again."</p>
    <p>Then I knew that I was a mutation after all -- mentally. The General and I just didn't think the same way. We didn't have the same values and we never would. He hadn't matured in an atomic world.</p>
    <p>I had. I picked up the pistol from the General's desk. His brain was obsolescent anyway.</p>
    <p>Then I was somebody else.</p>
    <p>"Cities?" I said to my visitor. "No, we'll never rebuild them. We won't need to."</p>
    <p>"But the world is in ruins."</p>
    <p>"Technology is the answer."</p>
    <p>"You mean machines can build where men cannot?"</p>
    <p>"Aren't they doing it?"</p>
    <p>They were -- yes. Old as I was, over a hundred -- whoever I was -- I could not remember a time when the planet had not been radiotoxic. Not all of it, of course. The men that were left, the survivors, gathered in the islands relatively free from the poison. Travel, even by plane, would have been too dangerous, but we had the matter-transmitters. So we were not insular. There were the colonized planets.</p>
    <p>Still, Earth was the home. With the halftime of the radio-dust, it would be a long time before most of the planet would become habitable. Yet Earth could be rebuilt, in preparation, by machines.</p>
    <p>"I will show you my plan," I said. "Come with me. I'll be dead long before there's a use for my Mechandroids, but that day will surely come."</p>
    <p>He followed me along the corridor. He was a powerful man, one of the most powerful in the world, but he followed me like a young student.</p>
    <p>"It's hard to know the best plan," he said, half to himself.</p>
    <p>"We have a Galaxy to colonize. Human minds can't cope with that. Nor can machines. The machines must fail because they're emotionless and inhuman. What you need is a human machine or a mechanical human. A perfect blend. A synthesis. Like my Mechandroids."</p>
    <p>I pulled back a curtain and showed him the young strong body in the glass coffin. The machines clicked and hummed from all around. The wires quivered slightly.</p>
    <p>"This is one of my Mechandroids," I said. "They cannot reproduce; they do not breed true. But they can be manufactured. It's as though a machine had given birth to a human."</p>
    <p>"He looks thoroughly normal."</p>
    <p>"I chose his parents. I needed the right heredity. I selected the chromosomes most suited to my needs -- and I tried time after time before I succeeded. But then this Mechandroid was born. Almost since birth he has been trained -- hypnogenically -- educated, indoctrinated, by the thinking-machines.</p>
    <p>"He has been taught to think as accurately as a machine. The human brain is theoretically capable of such discipline but the experiment has never been tried before to this extent. Mechandroids, I believe, can solve all human problems, and solve them correctly."</p>
    <p>"Machine-trained?" he said doubtfully. "Machines must serve men. They must free men, so that the capacity of the human brain may be fulfilled. These Mechandroids will smooth the path, so that man may follow the highest science -- that of thought."</p>
    <p>"There's no danger?" he asked, looking at the silent Mechandroid.</p>
    <p>"There's no danger," I said.</p>

    <p>Then I was somebody else.</p>
    <p>Saturn blazed in the sky above me, blotting out half the firmament, as I fled down the twisting street from the Mechandroid. I had to find somebody who knew what to do. But nobody seemed alive in the city. Nobody but the silent striding creature that was pursuing me.</p>
    <p>Homecoming, eh? I was Vega-born. I was sixteen. I'd taken the great jump across interstellar space in the matter-transmitter with my Age Group -- nine of them -- for the Earth tour and, because all Solar tours start with the outer planets, we'd stepped out of the matter-receiver in Titan.</p>
    <p>Then everything happened at once, too fast for me to follow. The Mechandroid came running toward us -- and we began to fall, one by one. So we scattered. With my usual bad luck, I managed to blunder right into a group of the Mechandroids who were working at something.</p>
    <p>They were in a big room, gathered around a table where a body lay. Above the table was a shining web -- a neural matrix, hooked up to a matter-transmitter. I knew enough about basic physics to get some idea of what was happening and I stopped right there, like a statue, watching.</p>
    <p>The Mechandroids were making a super-Mechandroid -- if that's the term. People had talked about the possibility. Everybody, I guess, was a little afraid, because the Mechandroids were plenty smart and if they worked out a collateral mutation -- they're individually sterile -- why, then, a super-Mechandroid would be horribly powerful and dangerous.</p>
    <p>For the Mechandroids can be controlled, but a super-Mechandroid couldn't.</p>
    <p>They said, not long ago, that they weren't capable of solving certain galactic problems and they wanted to go ahead and build what they called a second-stage Mechandroid. Of course they were forbidden.</p>
    <p>But the body on the table before me, under the shining neural web, was a super-Mechandroid in the making. If a thing like that -- with all its potential intelligence and lack of emotion -- came alive it would be too dangerous to think about.</p>
    <p>I turned around and started running again. I kept on running. Once I heard a scream, pretty far away.</p>
    <p>If the only way the Mechandroids could build their second-stage Mechandroid was to destroy every human in the Titan city -- why, that was the logical solution. So that's what they'd done. I passed an Exploratory Station and took a minute to go in and grab a vacuum suit. Carrying it, I headed for a gate in the great dome that covered the city.</p>
    <p>Two hours later I was sitting on a mountainside half a mile away, looking down on the dome and wondering how long my air would last. I felt pretty lonesome with Saturn dropping toward the horizon and only the dark and the stars around me.</p>
    <p>After awhile I saw the ships come. You don't see many ships these days but I knew what they were. Half a dozen of them came down silently out of the blackness and hovered above the city and a moment later there wasn't any city -- just a big burst of light and sound and energy.</p>
    <p>I sent up my SOS rockets and got picked up. On the trip back I heard a lot of talk about how we were going to get the Mechandroids under tight control and keep them there. Supervision for every one of the creatures. No chance to get together and make a super-Mechandroid.</p>
    <p>I guess I didn't enjoy Earth as much as I'd thought. It had been rebuilt and most of the radioactivity was gone. There was just one machine-city left -- a museum these days. But the planet seemed small.</p>
    <p>Of course we started out from Earth in the beginning. But now we've got the Galaxy.</p>
    <p>Then I was somebody else.</p>
    <p>I was Job Paynter.</p>
    <p>Every individual is expendable, but the race is not. I am not, but not unnecessarily. My value to the solar community is high. And why not? I am competent in my work -- general integration, Seventh Galactic Sector, Earth-based. (I am competent, or was until we opened that cavern under the mountain on Earth, and found Job Paynter asleep there. No, I am competent still. Puzzled but able to find an answer when all the returns are in. Meanwhile I must think objectively about this mystery. I must think objectively.)</p>
    <p>The Mechandroid Belem's desertion should have been reported to me immediately. There is no excuse for incompetence in a world where specialized training begins before birth and where reorientation treatment can be had as often as necessary.</p>
    <p>When I investigated Belem's disappearance I was much disturbed to learn how many other Mechandroids had vanished at the same time. I immediately assigned an all-out search, Galaxywide. But I was not too hopeful.</p>
    <p>The race moves on. It has its human limitations. The tools we make have no limitations at all. When we educate ourselves to learn to handle those tools most efficiently we can go on to the next step, whatever it may be. Meanwhile there must be check and balance -- rigid control.</p>
    <p>I assigned to the Mechandroid Belem a problem involving the opening of the Betelgeuse system. I had worked with Belem before. While Mechandroid knowledge and experience goes into a common pool Belem's reactions would be a shade quicker since he had once opened a similar system before, so I asked him. At that time I was on the Antares base. When I checked later on Belem he had vanished.</p>
    <p>We went through the automatic routine. We studied the records and traced Belem's movements up to the moment of his disappearance. We learned several interesting things. Obviously Belem had thought it necessary to disappear in order to solve his assigned problem. So we checked on the problem. The Andromeda system was involved and we discovered that there was something odd, hitherto undiscovered, about the Andromeda sector.</p>
    <p>First of all there was a potential nova involved. Secondly, a new type of matter existed on one of the planets revolving about the star that was preparing to explode. It seemed to be a neutral matter, in absolute stasis. We quarantined the system immediately, pending farther investigation.</p>
    <p>You never know into what queer bypaths a Mechandroid's investigation will lead. The creatures see factors involved that no human mind would bother with. They're never content with ten decimals but always work down to the absolute quantity. It didn't surprise me a great deal to find recording-tapes in Belem's laboratory which described and localized a terrestrial time-axis.</p>
    <p>We went to the point charted. Belem had already worked out a system for displacing the special atomic structure involved and waking the subjects. What subjects? I learned that soon enough.</p>
    <p>At the time-axis, which existed not far from the ancient bed of the St. Lawrence River, we found a shell of matter. R-type radiations showed us there were four living beings within that shell. They were in drugged hypnotic sleep. One of them was the Mechandroid Belem. The second was myself. The others were an unknown man and woman.</p>
    <p>My Director discussed the situation with me.</p>
    <p>"Belem has been located?" I asked.</p>
    <p>"We thought so," the Director said, "but you're in the time-axis chamber too. You're apparently in two places at once -- so Belem may be as well. You know how dangerous a Mechandroid on an unorthodox problem can be. Don't forget what happened to Titan twenty years ago. Well, obviously four people have, in the past, used drags and hypnosis to free their minds from time-consciousness as their bodies were freed by the atomic displacement their device has set up around them."</p>
    <p>"And I'm with them, it seems."</p>
    <p>"You have no memory of it? But they came out of the past -- all three of them."</p>
    <p>"Circular time? Spiral time?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know," the Director said. "It's theoretical so far. The empirical method obviously is to waken these four and find out what happened to them. How they came to be in this time-axis. Certainly a Mechandroid loose in time is too dangerous to be permitted. As for you -- "</p>
    <p>We had no answer to that, either of us. I was standing here, solid and real. But my double, my other self, was in the time-axis.</p>
    <p>"Waken them," the Director said.</p>
    <p>That was obviously the next step. The only possible step.</p>
    <p>"Very well," I said. It was my job. A job must be completed at any cost. Men are expendable. Mankind is not.</p>
    <p>Then I was Jeremy Cortland again.</p>
    <p>We were in the Swan Garden, Paynter and I, looking at each other across far distances. The shadows of a dozen other selves faded and wavered through my mind -- and simultaneously I felt a strange sort of mental withdrawal. With the dying remnant of Paynter's memory, I knew the reason. As I had been reading -- living in -- other minds, so he had been reading my own.</p>
    <p>But he did not know that the Mechandroid Belem -- De Kalb -- was spying through my brain. I felt certain of that, as certain as though -- De Kalb -- Belem had told me in so many words. No, Paynter might have stripped my mind clean of its memories, but there was one memory of the Mechandroid's curious powers had kept from his grasp -- the brief adventure I had had, via matter-transmitter, on another planet among Mechandroids.</p>
    <p>Abruptly full realization came to me. I remembered the "autopsy" I had glimpsed -- the Mechandroids clustered about a long table on which a body lay and above which a shining web quivered. Once, twenty years ago, a boy had seen a similar sight on Titan -- the creation of a super-Mechandroid, the experiment utterly forbidden through all the Galaxy. A city had been blasted into dust to stop that danger. I remembered, strangely, with another man's memory.</p>
    <p>Now it was happening again. A second stage man-machine was being constructed somewhere on some far planet -- and Paynter did not know that, and I could not tell him. The post-hypnotic command was too strong for me. I could not betray the secret to Paynter even if I tried.</p>
    <p>Which reminded me that Paynter now had my memories. His face was grayish as he watched me.</p>
    <p>"That new type of matter we've just found in the Andromeda system," he said. "I know what it is now. You called it the nekron."</p>
    <p>Then he must know as well that I was infected with the -- the thing, that I was a carrier, a culture for that swift, slaying thing that no grip could hold.</p>
    <p>But he did not mention it. Instead, in a troubled way, he began to talk about Belem.</p>
    <p>"Belem was set the problem of opening the Betelgeuse system. Which is simple enough. But the Mechandroids are thorough. I suspect that Belem checked all the possible influential factors, and saw that nekronic matter exists in Andromeda on a planet of a sun ready to become a nova. "When that happens the violent explosion will carry the nekronic atoms, on light radiations, far into interstellar space -- far enough to reach and infect Betelgeuse. For some reason I don't know yet Belem decided the time-axis should be -- " He paused, scowling. "Did he leave those notes purposely? Did he want us to open the time-axis chamber, Cortland?"</p>
    <p>"How should I know?" I asked. "You've got all my memories now, haven't you?"</p>
    <p>"I think he did. But where is Belem now?" I knew that -- but I couldn't tell him.</p>
    <p>"Why did Belem disappear? Why have a dozen other Mechandroids disappeared? Why didn't they announce the problem publicly?"</p>
    <p>He had forgotten he was still wearing the helmet. Now he lifted it slowly from his head and I followed his example. "Because they had to work in secret," he said tentatively. "Now what could they do in secret that they couldn't do with all the science of the Galaxy to help them? There's only one thing. The Mechandroids must solve the problems set them --</p>
    <p>"They are making a second-stage Mechandroid," Paynter said flatly. "That must be what's happening. Scylla and Charybdis then. For a super-Mechandroid is as certain a menace as the nekron itself."</p>
    <p>"But why?" I asked, prompted by a conviction that the devil I knew -- the nekronic infection -- was far worse than any manlike machine, no matter how perfected.</p>
    <p>"Because the Mechandroids would probably obey it instead of us," Paynter told me. "The Mechandroids are vulnerable because they're partially human. A second-stage type probably wouldn't be. When you consider the knowledge and skills the Mechandroids already have -- and if they're applying them to the creation of a mutation of their own -- why, such a monster could easily be invulnerable. Suppose it worked on absolute logic? That might call for the extinction of all life-forms! I don't know. No one knows. How can anyone think like a mutation from the Mechandroid type?"</p>
    <p>I shook my head. "Don't ask me. I've got my own problems. Those four asleep in the time-axis. There must be an answer somewhere, Paynter. There must be!"</p>
    <p>"There is an answer." He said it so soberly that I felt an instant's chill in my own mind. I had good reason to feel a chill. Paynter went on in a very somber voice. "Now I'll tell you the truth, Cortland," he said.</p>

     <p>15. CRUMBLING FLESH</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>The four silent figures lay deep in their age-old slumber in the chamber under the mountain. I saw them there again. I could feel the weight of the helmet on my head and I was this time fully aware of the Swan Garden around me and the sound of Paynter's breathing at my side. But I was seeing the projection of a three-dimensional film. I was looking into the chamber as a camera's eye had looked.</p>
    <p>"This is the official record we made when we opened the cave," Paynter said invisibly at my elbow. "Now watch carefully what happens. No one knows this but you and myself and the few technicians who were on the spot. We've kept it quiet. It's so -- so -- well, watch and you'll see."</p>
    <p>Nothing moved in the cave. Nothing had moved, I suppose, for a thousand years or more, not since all motion ceased when we sank into our long slumber. But now lights began to flash from beyond the gray egg of nothingness that walled us in. Paynter's technicians were at work, trying to break that shell, trying to hatch out -- what? Something terrifying. I knew that by the tone of Paynter's voice.</p>
    <p>The lights flashed and faded, glowed again, paled. Now the camera drew back and I could see Paynter himself, standing beside a group of workers and a battery of machines. All were intent upon the egg of time that held the sleepers.</p>
    <p>It was curious to hear Paynter speak then -- the Paynter of the cavern, speaking in the film, not the Paynter who sat beside me. Duplication piled upon duplication.</p>
    <p>"What are the chances?" I heard him ask. "Are they going to wake?"</p>
    <p>Murmurs answered him. After awhile, during which his eyes were very thoughtful upon the sleepers and upon the woman among the sleepers in particular, I heard him say in a musing voice, "We should have one of the entertainers here. If this is actually a time involvement, as you say, then these people will have been asleep a long while and they'll feel bewildered when they wake.</p>
    <p>"We need someone like -- yes, Topaz -- to speed their adjustment." (I knew why he had thought of Topaz. I knew he had seen, without realizing it, the face of Topaz implicit in Dr. Essen's sleeping face.)</p>
    <p>"Send for Topaz," he said firmly, his voice echoing in the cavern as ours had echoed once, a thousand years or many thousand of years before.</p>
    <p>(Now perhaps this is as good a place as any for a word about the language he was speaking. It was certainly English but not as familiar a language as I write down. Any living tongue rapidly accumulates new words and phrases, drops old ones, assigns new meanings to words already in use, so that the colloquialisms of one generation are gibberish to the generation before it.</p>
    <p>(The English we were speaking was changed, not a living language. Matter-transmission had spread civilization over a vast area and some common tongue was a necessity, but it couldn't be a tongue that changed or it would soon cease to be a common language. So it wasn't easy to follow what these people said around me -- but it wasn't impossible either.) The camera ground on for about thirty seconds more and then blurred briefly. Beside me Paynter spoke in a quick, impatient voice.</p>
    <p>"Skip all that. It's just more experiments. This was the period when they completed the analysis of the clothing and established the period from which it came as mid-Twentieth Century. It was about six hours after that before they breached the shell of force. I was notified and I sent for Topaz and came in myself for the finish. Now watch."</p>
    <p>The cavern took shape again before me. Clear in the bath of what was probably ultra-violet, because it brought the images out so clearly, the four sleepers lay. But this time there was a hum of activity around them. Men passed before the camera, obscuring it now and then, carrying lenses and long glowing tubes and angular things a little like sextants. I heard Topaz's sweet high laughter and Paynter's rebuke, "Watch," Paynter said beside me. "It happened very suddenly."</p>
    <p>As he spoke, I saw the change begin. It was like a cleavage in space, a widening crack that spiderwebbed across the empty air like a riven bubble of plastic. The sleepers showed for an instant, distorted as though seen through a shattering substance with a different refractive index from air.</p>
    <p>Then the cavern darkened for an instant. The four bodies seemed to spring into more dimensional reality -- I sensed that their clarity was not due to the ultraviolet bath. It was as though a stereopticon image had become tangible. For a flashing second the four figures became part of -- normal space. The shell of energy Dr. Essen had created so long ago no longer prisoned them beyond space and time.</p>
    <p>The place grew darker still. It gave me a feeling of inexplicable urgency. I was on the verge of remembering something -- that reddish twilight with faint lights twinkling through it was -- was --</p>
    <p>My thought paused. For the bodies were -- crumbling,</p>
    <p>I had a second of horrible, sickening terror, as though I felt my own flesh falling into dust too. Instinctively my fingers tightened on my legs. It was bewildering to feel my own flesh firm beneath my hands while before me in the projection I could see the same flesh crumble from my bones.</p>
    <p>I watched myself disintegrate in the red twilight that had filled the cavern, fall swiftly into dust as if the thousand years of time we had cheated as we slept was taking its toll all in one final moment. But I knew that was not the answer. Living flesh does not crumble like that and we had been living until the egg broke around us. There was some more terrifying solution than that.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, in my bewilderment and terror, I knew what the answer was. That shadowy red twilight, with lights faintly flashing across an empty world -- I had seen that dusk before. In that same twilight I had seen the Face of Ea looking out over the world's night. That crumbling of our flesh into dust had been no accident.</p>
    <p>I knew I had watched the four of us murdered in our age-long sleep, deliberately dispersed into nothingness -- by what? By whom? I had no way of guessing, but it seemed to me the red twilight that filled the cave indicated something of an answer. Nothing was happening to us at random, I knew fully in that moment of revelation. It was planned, deliberately planned -- and by the people of the Face?</p>
    <p>They had summoned us across the millenniums. Had they planned our shipwreck here on the strand of some middle future and then, with calm intent, scattered our dissolving bones upon the cavern floor, having used and finished us?</p>
    <p>No, for we were still alive.</p>
    <p>Only I remembered my own identity clearly, but I was sure the icily violent ego of Murray lay buried somewhere beneath the surface of Paynter's mind. I had looked into Letta Essen's eyes in the lovely face of Topaz. De Kalb must linger somewhere, submerged but waiting, behind the metal eyes of Belem. So we were not dead.</p>
    <p>The dust that had been ourselves ceased its crumbling and falling and settled into long, roughly man shaped mounds on the floor of the cave.</p>
    <p>"That happened coincidentally," Paynter said with elaborate detachment. "But something rather odd took place at the same time. Look."</p>
    <p>The scene changed. The focus had shifted to another lens on the far side of the cavern. In the foreground Paynter stood, behind Topaz. Their faces were intent and horrified as they watched the egg begin to crack.</p>
    <p>The film had stepped back sixty seconds and I was watching again the first beginnings of the disaster inside the shell of time. That curious riving of the air began again, the red twilight glimmering through, repeating itself as it would repeat endlessly whenever anyone chose to play this recording over.</p>
    <p>But now, as the bodies began to crumble, I saw a change slip across Paynter's face. I saw it go blank, then suddenly go quite bright with a blaze of awareness -- and then totally blank.</p>
    <p>His knees sagged. He folded up and dropped limply forward. Someone jumped to his side from the crowd at his back, caught him and eased him to the dusty floor. As he fell I could see beyond him the small, brightly colored body that was Topaz, collapsed without a sound.</p>
    <p>There was milling confusion around the two for a moment. Then Paynter stirred and the crowd backed away a little. Paynter sat up, consciousness returning visibly to his blank face. Topaz, beside him, stirred and moved her hand, lifted it and, with her eyes still closed, brushed the clustering curls from her face with a curiously innocent vanity.</p>
    <p>At my elbow Paynter said, "All right, that was that. A moment's faintness. Neither of us suffered anything worse. But let's go back again to the moment the shell cracked and Topaz and I fainted. There was a crowd outside, waiting to see what would happen. You'd be surprised how easy it is to draw a crowd. They didn't take long to assemble, via matter-transmission, once word got out. Some of our other cameras caught an interesting detail or two."</p>
    <p>Now I saw a rolling slope thronged with men and women. Figures were toiling up from a plain below, where last I had seen the forests of northern Canada stretch unbroken. In the far distance a low white building gleamed in the sunlight among orchards.</p>
    <p>"That building," Paynter told me, "is the Kerry Plum Orchard transmitter. All these people came through it. They came from all over the galaxy, of course. No way to trace where they started from. Which is a pity because -- well, look."</p>
    <p>I looked -- and saw my own face.</p>
    <p>Duplication doubled and redoubled. My head swam as I tried to realize it, to count up how many Jerry Cortlands were in existence in this one space and time. One had fallen to dust in the cave. One sat here in the Swan Garden beside Paynter. One strolled up the hillside toward the cavern, casually, through the crowd. It was myself, all right. I wore rather ragged shorts and a tattered pullover.</p>
    <p>I turned left around a rock with part of the crowd and then there was a sudden humming excitement all over the hillside and a flash of reddish light from the cave.</p>
    <p>"We've gone back again to the moment when the bodies began to disintegrate," Paynter reminded me. "Down in the cave Topaz and I are collapsing. Up here -- watch yourself."</p>
    <p>I saw the same look of dazed wonder melt into blank-ness on my pictured face. I saw myself fall.</p>
    <p>"When you woke again," Paynter was saying, "you were in the transmitter room by the City. Topaz was with you. That was when your memories started. Remember?"</p>
    <p>"You mean -- that was me?" I demanded. "That man who came with the crowd? The me sitting here now? Oh no, that isn't possible! I remember! I went to sleep in the cave in the Twentieth Century and woke here. I never came out of a transmitter and joined a crowd in the Laurentians. You told me you'd wakened me in the cave!"</p>
    <p>"Not, exactly, no," Paynter said. "I just gave you your head. There was so much here that nobody understood, you see. I wanted you to go your own way until I knew all I could learn from you. Then I told you the truth. What could be fairer than that?"</p>
    <p>"But I'm not that man on the hillside! Who was he? Where did he come from? He isn't me!"</p>
    <p>"Well, you're that man. You saw what happened to the bodies in the cave. Your duplicate, my duplicate, Belem's, the woman's -- they all disintegrated. As for who you are, I don't know. It's odd but not unheard of. With galaxy-wide colonization there must be a good many people in stray corners who have never been registered. You're one of them.</p>
    <p>"We tried but there's no record of your prints and history. However, you are the man who fainted on the hillside. It took you longer to recover than it did us and when you woke you called yourself Cortland and you've just given me some very fantastic history. Which rings true, incidentally. You believe it. You aren't faking."</p>
    <p>"Of course not. I was in the time chamber with the others!"</p>
    <p>"You fell to dust, I suppose." Paynter's voice was impatiently amused. "Wait a minute. I thought I noticed something in the crowd near you. Hold on."</p>
    <p>I felt him move. The picture flashed on before me, picked up again the scene on the slope. Paynter gave some orders in an undertone, and the camera paused, halting in mid-stride a man who had just entered the edge of the picture.</p>
    <p>It was De Kalb.</p>
    <p>No, not De Kalb -- Belem. He turned his face to the camera and light glinted on the quicksilver eyes.</p>
    <p>The daylight flashed suddenly red again. The crowd nearby surged, chattering around me -- my duplicate -- as he fell. And Belem staggered. You could see the cold resolute Mechandroid brain gather itself to resist whatever assault this was upon its integrity. And the Mechandroid succeeded where the merely human had failed. Belem stumbled a little, leaned against the rock I had seen myself circle a moment before in the film, slid down so that he half crouched against it, his face in his hands.</p>
    <p>Then quietly, in about a quarter of a minute, he rose and walked back toward the Kerry transmitter, moving stiffly even for him, his face bewildered.</p>
    <p>Paynter was saying in my ear, "So that's where he was!" But deep in the center of my mind a stirring of surprise gathered all my attention. Belem was watching too. Belem was thinking in almost the same words Paynter used, "So that is what happened! Now -- now I almost understand."</p>

     <p>16. THE SUBTERRANE</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>There was silence in the Swan Garden for a long moment. Then Paynter lifted the helmet from my head and stood looking down thoughtfully at me. The crystalline bower came back around me. I was looking into Murray's face but it was Paynter, from Colchan Three and this middle future, who spoke.</p>
    <p>"There were four asleep in the cave," he said. "There were four who blanked out for a time when the sleepers disintegrated. That must mean we living four were duplicates in more than appearance to those who were destroyed. I don't understand, of course.</p>
    <p>"The integrating machines are working on it now. Eventually they'll hand us all the factors and their conclusions. Meanwhile, Cortland, I think I caught an impression of yours while our minds were in rapport. Is Topaz a duplicate of that woman in the cave?"</p>
    <p>"Dr. Essen," I said. "I think she is. Yes." But silently, to myself, I was thinking. "They all have identities but me. I'm myself. And yet I saw Jerry Cortland dissolve. That must mean that I'm the nameless man, the one who came up the hillside from nowhere and fainted. When he woke up, he was Jerry Cortland -- me. And I'll never dare sleep in this world for fear that when I wake I'll be -- him. Not myself. I saw myself disintegrated in the cave for a purpose, by some means I don't understand. I'm dead. When this man wakes up, I'll -- "</p>
    <p>"All right, Cortland," Paynter said briskly. "I'll leave you here for an hour. You'll be quite safe, of course. Topaz will rejoin you in a moment or two."</p>
    <p>"Am I a prisoner?" I asked.</p>
    <p>"Well, no, not exactly." He gave me a grim smile. "You want the same things we do, I suppose. An answer to all this. I'm assuming you've told us the truth. I'm as sure of that as it's possible to be. Of course you may have powers you've been able to hide from us, so we'll keep an eye on you until we know more. Topaz will bring you to me in an hour. By then I hope well have an answer from the integrators."</p>
    <p>He gave me a stiff salute of farewell and turned away, pushed among the lacy palmetto growths and was gone, presumably into the matter-transmitter. I couldn't understand why he hadn't killed me.</p>
    <p>For there had been five in the time-axis, not four. And the fifth was the most dangerous thing ever let loose upon a galaxy. The nekronic killer had come out with me. How, I could not guess, if it were true that I was not Jerry Cortland, but a nameless man from the hillside below the Laurentian cavern. The Infection was not in the flesh then but in the -- mind? The memory? At any moment I knew I might feel that blinding shock thrilling through me, the exploding burst of energy that meant another death.</p>
    <p>Paynter knew. He had read my memories. He wasn't top man, of course. When his findings were integrated the orders might be simply, "Kill Cortland." It's what I'd have done in their place. It was only logical.</p>
    <p>So they expected me to wait, did they? Wait for what, the firing squad?</p>
    <p>Well, maybe I wouldn't do it. I felt like laughing when I remembered how complicated life had seemed back in my own day. There I'd had only one time, one space, one Jerry Cortland to consider. And even then I'd been on the rollercoaster with a splinter in the seat of my pants. Now Jerry Cortland was dead. He was lying in a heap of dust in a cavern somewhere on another planet for all I knew.</p>
    <p>Illogical? Oh, sure. For now I was up against something too big for the human mind to comprehend, really and -- irrationally -- I felt cheerful.</p>
    <p>I saw another of the pale green oranges floating along the stream and plucked it out deftly, sank my teeth into it. It was alcoholic, in a mildly exhilarating way. I let the tingling juice run down my throat and --</p>
    <p>"You are in great danger," a voice in my brain said coldly and suddenly.</p>
    <p>I clapped my free hand to my head and pressed the bone beneath the skin in some primitive impulsive attempt to massage the devils out of my brain. He was there -- De Kalb, Belem -- with his cold metal gaze looking out through my eyes and his cold metal thoughts moving through mine.</p>
    <p>"Can you read my mind?" I asked, all but vocally, making the question clear in the front of my mind.</p>
    <p>"No. Only when you put your thoughts as clearly as this. Please try to keep them clearer. That fruit you are eating -- it fogs the mind. Throw it away. I must consult you now."</p>
    <p>Deliberately I took another deep bite of the alcoholic orange. No one had invited him into my mind, I thought somewhat incoherently, the Swan Garden looking pleasantly blurred before me. I had no real reason to trust either De Kalb or Belem. I didn't like the way the Mechandroid could crawl into my head, pull up a chair and settle down for a free sight-seeing trip.</p>
    <p>If it worked the other way now -- I'd enjoy a quick round-trip through Topaz mind, for instance. She was not only lovely but unpredictable as an ocelot. I'd have given a good deal to look into her mind. I imagined it would surprise me. And as for Paynter -- I knew his type. He had that conviction of absolute rightness that makes fanatics. He hadn't left me entirely on my own, I was pretty sure.</p>
    <p>"Drop that fruit," the voice in my mind said. "Drop that fruit."</p>
    <p>I didn't intend to. I started to flex my elbow to bring the orange up for another bite -- but my muscles weren't working very well. They weren't working at all. My arm went lax, my fingers turned into putty and the orange fell with a splash back into the stream. Regretfully I watched it bob away.</p>
    <p>"Do you see that purple fruit?" the inexorable voice inquired. "There, coming over the bend. Catch it."</p>
    <p>I decided to do nothing.</p>
    <p>I found myself plucking a purple object shaped like a cigar from the stream, lifting it to my mouth, biting off a section. It was succulent too, but astringent. The giddy elation began to leave me. More soberly I took a second bite.</p>
    <p>"Very good," Belem's disembodied voice said. "I don't want to work that hard again. It isn't easy to do this. You may need all the strength I can give you sooner than you think. Don't make me exhaust myself fighting you."</p>
    <p>"How do you work it?" I inquired with the front part of my consciousness. "Where are you, anyhow? Isn't it crowded in there? Look out for the left lobe -- it's slippery."</p>
    <p>"That is probably humor," Belem said coldly. "Wasted on a Mechandroid. I have no intention of telling you how I do this but there is no reason why you shouldn't know where I am. Exactly where you saw me last. My body remains in stasis while my mind is in close rapport with yours.</p>
    <p>"I can see and hear and feel everything you do. I can read your clearer thoughts. I can, with a great effort, control your motor reflexes for a brief time. Whether you like it or not your fate and mine are now linked until I can effect a separation again."</p>
    <p>"For better or worse!" I said wildly. "For richer or poorer -- I see another orange coming along; shall we have one together?"</p>
    <p>"Finish that purple fruit," Belem ordered, "You may need another. I am going to take you through the transmitter now to a certain underground region whose existence we have suspected for a long while. I learned its location during your rapport with Paynter.</p>
    <p>"It is a highly secret place but together I believe we can enter it and perform an important task. I believe it will in the end be as important to you as to us. In some way none of us yet understands your destiny and mine are linked through that time-axis where we both have slept. We -- "</p>
    <p>"Don't forget Paynter was there too," I reminded him.</p>
    <p>"I know. I've explored your memory along with Paynter. I know all the essentials now and I believe I begin to get a glimmer of the pattern. Our first task is to visit the Government Subterrane. If you will turn to the left now and go back along the path to the transmitter room -- "</p>
    <p>"Why should I?" I was feeling sullen as the exhilaration died in me. "This is my brain, not yours. I have my own problems. Go crawl into somebody else's mind or do your own dirty work. I'm in enough of a jam right now with Paynter, or I will be when -- "</p>
    <p>"When he realizes that you are a carrier for the nekronic killer, exactly. Paynter will not hesitate to sacrifice you when the time comes. When it does you and I will be at a safe distance, with the object I mean to get in the Subterrane. Now will go or must I force you?"</p>
    <p>I started to speak -- aloud in my anger -- but before the words could come there was a ripple of self-conscious laughter among the star-shaped leaves and Topaz swept forward through the fronds and spun around before me. She was covered with spangles, glittering, dazzling, flickering, all colors, clinging to her skin, her hair, her floating veils.</p>
    <p>"Oh, how beautiful I am!" she caroled, with an air of innocent vainglory. "Tell me, did you ever see anything so beautiful before?"</p>
    <p>"Never in my life," I assured her. "It's -- " My jaw snapped shut on the last word. My muscles tightened and without the least conscious volition I found I had turned my back to her and was marching down the path toward the matter-transmitter. In my brain a cool, metallic mind seemed to be saying with an intonation of despair, "Human beings!"</p>
    <p>It was interesting to watch my own hands manipulating the buttons that selected the proper wave-bands for our destination. The process looked far too simple -- there were only half a dozen buttons in all -- but I assumed the Mechandroid, gazing through my eyes, tightening and releasing my muscles, knew what he was doing.</p>
    <p>He did. The room shimmered before me, disorientation and brief nausea shook us both together in gigantic oblivion and --</p>
    <p>We emerged into a large underground concourse -- I think it was underground; it sounded and felt like it -- thronged with busy men and women who paid me only the slightest of glancing attention as I pushed among them, half guided now and half of my own volition. There were people here in costumes so various that I suppose my own clothing was no more outlandish than anyone else's.</p>
    <p>I think this was a nexus in the great web of matter-transmission, under the surface of what planet I have no idea.</p>
    <p>People from colonies all over the Galaxy must have changed stations here. I know I attracted no attention as I hurried through the cosmopolitan crowd toward a row of transmission rooms in the center of the concourse, closed the door behind me, manipulated more buttons.</p>
    <p>It was curious, I thought to myself as the familiar disorientation swam through my brain, how little I was seeing of this marvelous world of the middle future. Topaz had assured me that cities were obsolete and mankind lived in luxurious isolation wherever his fancy dictated.</p>
    <p>Yet all I had seen so far, except for the Swan Garden, had been the underpinnings of the culture, the girders upon which its farming luxuries were builded. What lay above-ground, on the flowering surfaces of the planets, I was not to know, then or -- perhaps -- ever.</p>
    <p>The room steadied about me. The door slid open.</p>
    <p>I looked down a long corridor bathed in white light.</p>
    <p>"This is the Subterrane," Belem's voice in my brain said.</p>

     <p>17. THE WORLD OF BELEM</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Had I been expecting something semi-miraculous I should have been disappointed. I had seen similar passages under Grand Central Station. Here there was nothing at all unusual -- simply a white corridor, empty and silent.</p>
    <p>"In your day," the Mechandroid told me, "this would have been a grouping of thick doors and locks. The Subterrane is the arsenal of the government. It isn't on Earth. Walk forward."</p>
    <p>I obeyed. I felt a brief tingling, a rather pleasant vibration that passed and was gone.</p>
    <p>"You have just passed between a cathode and anode that would have disrupted the brain of any Mechandroid. The pattern is keyed so that it's harmless to humans. No Mechandroid has ever been permitted in the Subterrane -- till now."</p>
    <p>So they were vulnerable after all.</p>
    <p>"Why, yes," Belem remarked, surprised. "Every existing thing is capable of negation -- of altering its condition to non-existence. The less adaptable an organism, the easier it is to destroy. But this cathode-anode device is not portable and its field is quite limited.</p>
    <p>"It is useful only for defense -- not for offense. You would be destroyed, too, if you hurled yourself on a sharpened stake. The other devices are aimed at human beings who aren't wearing the protective helmets. Luckily -- "</p>
    <p>I wasn't in a corridor any more. Not a normal corridor. Planar geometry had suddenly and empirically been disproved. My eyes, conditioned to normal perspective, went dizzily out of focus as abruptly as gravity itself seemed to alter.</p>
    <p>You can't describe the indescribable. Lines of perspective meet at the vanishing point -- sure. So they say. But the walls and floor and ceiling of the white-lit tunnel curved in insanely a few feet ahead of me, crossed somehow and re-extended themselves toward me like a tapering cone. Such distortions of matter may be normal at the end of the universe but you shouldn't be able to reach out and touch -- Touch? But I couldn't even do that. Gravity had gone wrong, too. I suspected there was a riptide in the semicircular canals of my ears. Because I felt that I was falling, no matter in what direction I looked.</p>
    <p>There was no corridor. There was only white emptiness. Dead white and featureless except for the cone that pointed accusingly at me. I tried to move forward and a horrible, sick, giddiness loosened my muscles and then tightened them again as I strained to stand rigid. As long as I didn't move an inch I might not fall.</p>
    <p>"Walk forward!" the voice in my mind insisted. I shut my eyes and walked forward. At Belem's annoyed command, I reopened them and either fell or ran toward the white cone that was the corridor itself extended beyond infinity and in geometric reversal. As I moved I found myself curving away, along the line of the distortion, so that without knowing how it had happened I was hurrying in the opposite direction with my back to the cone.</p>
    <p>"I can't do this too often without resting," Belem said. "Open your mind. Relax. Let me control your muscles. This illusion is for human eyes only. I can screen it out and see the right way."</p>
    <p>It took tremendous effort on my part to keep my eyes open and my muscles relaxed. That disgusting falling sensation kept growing stronger and every sane instinct I had reacted violently at what my optic nerves described. I was walking into a vanishing point -- that was the only way to describe it. I walked right into the point of the white cone and through it -- don't ask me how, because it was an illusion -- and then I was in the white corridor again.</p>
    <p>I took ten unsteady steps, and came out into a wider tunnel that stretched, curving, to left and to right. Belem guided me to the left.</p>
    <p>There were hieroglyphics on the walls at regular intervals but I didn't realize they indicated doors until the Mechandroid told me to stop. All I had to do was touch the wall and a shutter opened like a cat's-eye, slitted, then oval, enlarging till I could step through into the room beyond. Behind me the panel closed noiselessly.</p>
    <p>It was a large room and there was a matter-transmitter in a corner. The walls were banked with paneling carrying the most complicated set of controls I had ever seen. On a glassy pillar in the center of the floor was a transparent box, small enough to hold in my palm, and it was bathed in a sparkle of glittering lights that poured out from two pencil-like cylinders embedded in the pillar, one on each side of the box.</p>
    <p>Within the box was a golden marble.</p>
    <p>"I know," I said dizzily. "It'll grant me three wishes."</p>
    <p>"That type of humor is a defense mechanism against fear," Belem told me unsympathetically. "Here is the main reason why I chose the difficult and dangerous method of entering your mind. No men of this age would have gone with me this far. They're all conditioned against Mechandroids.</p>
    <p>"You were the only one who could and would have got into the Subterrane. In that transparent box is, I think, the only weapon against which we have no defense at all. As long as it's within the field of radiation, as it is now, it's harmless. Remove it and, within two minutes, it, becomes activated."</p>
    <p>"What is it?"</p>
    <p>"A complicated pattern of energies. It's positively charged now. When it's activated, it becomes negatively charged. Then it creates a dead field for nearly a mile around it, in which no matter-transmitters will operate."</p>
    <p>"That doesn't seem so dangerous. You can get along without matter-transmitters long enough to walk a mile, can't you?"</p>
    <p>"Not if we're under siege. You saw our laboratory. Warfare is still a matter of siege unless one wants to wipe everything out and they don't. They'll want to inspect our work. With matter-transmission you can't besiege a place.</p>
    <p>"Everyone inside would simply leak away and escape, taking all their important work with them. This one weapon here is the only completed matrix available at this time. It takes a long while to complete the necessary energy-pattern. So, if we eliminate it, we can stand off a siege long enough to clear out the laboratory."</p>
    <p>"Eliminate it how?"</p>
    <p>"Set the matter-transmitter controls to -- anywhere. Some obsolete receiver at the edge of the galaxy, maybe. Pick up that box and -- fast! -- put it in the transmitter, before the radiation dies and it activates. Then the box will appear at the edge of the galaxy and paralyze energy facilities there."</p>
    <p>"For how long?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know. Long enough. It wouldn't harm humans but they'd have to walk to a station outside its field. The box can't be moved, incidentally, or you could just carry it to a spot beyond the range of the nearest transmitter. After it's activated it has almost absolute inertia. Right now, though, it's portable. Can you touch it?"</p>
    <p>I put out a tentative hand that was stopped in mid-air about a foot above the box. I pushed against nothing. I couldn't pass the invisible barrier.</p>
    <p>"I thought so," Belem said. "That stud in the pedestal -- try pressing it."</p>
    <p>I did. I reached for the box again. This time I could do it. The defense field, whatever it had been, was gone. The box was not very heavy. I set it down again with care.</p>
    <p>"All right," I said. "Fine. But what about me? Why should I help you?"</p>
    <p>"Paynter will kill you if you don't," Belem said patiently. "If he doesn't his superiors will as soon as it's established that you're a carrier of that nekronic killer, whatever it is. And I think I know. If you help me I believe I can solve that problem too.</p>
    <p>"There are two obvious reasons why I'll protect you. First, I can't get out of your brain until you're in physical contact with me again. If you're killed before then the psychic rapport impact may kill me too. After we finish this job you'll get in the transmitter and return to the world where I am now -- the one where you first saw me. As for the second reason -- "</p>
    <p>A sudden, violent contraction of all my muscles, like a simultaneous cramp in every limb, doubled me up without the slightest warning. I fell forward -- saw the floor hurtling toward me -- and felt my rebellious muscles relax again just in time to save myself from a crash. I was so startled that I scarcely noticed the lance of gauzy light, tendriled like a cobweb, that floated in the spot from which I had just been hurled. But Belem's thought said, "Paralysis projector!"</p>
    <p>What happened after that took almost no time at all.</p>
    <p>When I got my feet under me I whirled and faced the opened door-panel and the man standing there in arrested motion, weapon lifted. It was Paynter, his pale eyes glittering, his mouth drawn down in a grimace of anger and surprise. The weapon had a basket-hilt and a muzzle that looked like rubbery lips, puffing in and out petulantly.</p>
    <p>Belem had sensed his presence before I did. It was the Mechandroid's control of my motor reflexes that had jerked me forward in a spasmodic dodge that barely cleared the blast of the puffing weapon.</p>
    <p>I had no weapon of my own. Paynter was centering his on me for a second, more accurate shot. I hadn't the ghost of an idea how to avoid it.</p>
    <p>"What do I do now?" I demanded in desperation of the mind in my brain.</p>
    <p>"I don't know -- be quiet, I'm trying to think!" was all Belem had to offer.</p>
    <p>I sought Paynter's eyes, trying to put hypnosis into my own, saying, "Now wait a minute, Paynter! Hold on! I -- "</p>
    <p>He did not answer in words. He raised the weapon and took deliberate aim at me. I wondered whether he had been following from the first, how much he knew -- why he chose to kill me now, without hearing a word of defense. He wasn't even curious about how I'd got here.</p>
    <p>The puffy mouth of his weapon sucked in deeply and began to pout out again. In another second a web of light would shoot out at me and there was no room here even to dodge again, without colliding with that pedestal upon which the marble in its glass box rested. If I dodged I'd hit it.</p>
    <p>If I dodged I'd --</p>
    <p>That was the answer, of course. So obvious neither of us had seen it. It was the simplest answer in the world. I almost laughed as I snatched the glass box from its resting place and, in the same quick motion, hurled it straight at Paynter's face.</p>
    <p>No one can say he wasn't fast. His mind recognized the danger I had dropped in his hands in the same instant his muscles reacted. There was only one possible thing to do, and he did it. He dropped his gun and caught the precious and terribly dangerous box in mid-air.</p>
    <p>I didn't stop to watch. I was already halfway through the door of the matter-projector by the time Paynter's weapon hit the floor. I slammed the door shut with one kick and put my hands on the wall where the dials were.</p>
    <p>"Belem!" I thought urgently.</p>
    <p>On the other side of the slammed door, Paynter would be rushing the box back into place, back into its bath before the two-minute interval elapsed that would activate the thing and stop all matter-transmission for a cubic mile. If he fumbled it I was stuck here -- unless Belem moved fast.</p>
    <p>Luckily he moved. My fingers, without my own volition, were hastily spinning the verniered dials. Tarnished metal walls flashed into view around me.</p>

     <p>18. SPACE WRECK</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Belem said, "No, we're not going out. We're in the transmitter of an abandoned space-ship around Centaurus II. We located it from our laboratory years ago. We know a good many of these out-of-the-way transmitters, useful in cases just like this. I can't set the controls to take us directly to my headquarters or Paynter could simply read the dials and follow us as he did from the Swan Garden."</p>
    <p>I found I was breathing hard. The Mechandroid said we'd have to hurry. "We transported several cubic yards of air with us but that won't last long. Here, let me -- "</p>
    <p>I watched my hands move deftly on the corroded dials.</p>
    <p>I had one dizzying moment in which I thought of the terrible deeps of space all around us, the dead ship circling an alien star-group while our last air seeped out around us into the infinities of the dark.</p>
    <p>Fortunately for my own sanity, I had very little time in my turbulent hours in this middle future to pause and think. I had been catapulted into a culture so different from my own that my mind could not, I think, have endured the concept of those vast spaces which everyone here took as a commonplace. It was only in the small, unchanging superficialities of the culture that I could conceive bf it at all.</p>
    <p>The walls shimmered, blurred -- were translucent metal through which I could see a circle of bright green grass and a ring of low-roofed houses whose eaves turned up like Chinese roofs. The only living things in sight were a pigeon, flying low and trailing a red ribbon in its beak, and a dog who ran below, jumping to catch the ribbon now and then. I could hear it barking.</p>
    <p>"Hurry," Belem said and my hands found the dials on the clouded transparency of the wall. These dials were set in rings of colored tile but they worked like any other dials. I turned them, the room blurred ...</p>
    <p>I had had no idea there could be such a variety of transmitter-receiver rooms. Few of them had transparent walls, so that I had to guess what lay outside, but the rooms themselves ranged from functional steel boxes to padded lounges. Several times they swam with the perfume of exotic unknowns who must just have stepped out after a trip from -- who could begin to guess where?</p>
    <p>And once two wilting flowers the size of dinner-plates and colored a deep plushy crimson lay on a glass floor where some traveler had dropped them, stepping out. They went with us through four transitions and we left them at the fifth when Belem said at last, "Here we'll get out. It's another concourse. I think we'll be safe now if we take a long jump to my base laboratory. Open the door."</p>
    <p>Like the other concourse it reminded me vividly, of the Times Square shuttle. Crowds hurried across vast open spaces, vanished into cubicles and poured from other cubicles in an intricate mesh of movement that linked a whole galaxy together.</p>
    <p>"See that row of doors with the blue lights over them?" Belem said. "Try to find an empty booth. I think the third from the end -- "</p>
    <p>A door opened as he indicated -- with my own hand -- which one he meant and a fat man in a long furred cloak upon which snow lay in still unmelted crystals came bustling importantly out, beating his cloak as he came.</p>
    <p>I stepped in, closed the door, avoiding the puddles of melting snow which the fat man had tracked in from some world I couldn't imagine. Perhaps Earth.</p>
    <p>"These rooms would be a fine way to spread disease, wouldn't they?" I asked Belem as I reached for the dial. "No telling where this snow-water came from, but it'll go along with us, I suppose, and we'll track your laboratory with melted water from Neptune or Canopus or -- "</p>
    <p>"It is most unlikely," Belem began pedantically in my mind, "that you would find snow -- "</p>
    <p>"Okay, okay. Forget it." I had just uncovered a disturbing thought. I was a carrier of disease myself. Had I been sowing the nekronic death on a dozen worlds already, leaving the virus in transmitters for those who came after me to carry still farther abroad?</p>
    <p>"There is no way of knowing that yet," Belem said. "Turn the dials." I did.</p>
    <p>It seemed to me that this time the vibration of the transmission was a little longer and more violent than before. I wondered if we were going an unusually long distance. Then the room steadied again and I pushed open the door.</p>
    <p>I expected the laboratory, enormously braced, enmeshed with catwalks and, sparkling far across the room, the bright neural, webbing that meant the dangerous man-machine was in the making. Perhaps Belem's motionless figure would stand there waiting beside the door.</p>
    <p>I looked out into the seething concourse we had just left. The fat man in the snowy cloak was only a dozen paces away in the crowd. We had not stirred from this station.</p>
    <p>"Try again," Belem said in my mind, after what seemed a very long pause, full of strain.</p>
    <p>I tried. The room shook and blurred, steadied. I opened the door.</p>
    <p>The concourse was till there. This time the fat man had almost vanished in the crowd though I could still see his fur cloak swing out as he dodged to avoid a group of adolescents with bright knapsacks on their shoulders, bound for -- what resort world in what distant corner of the galaxy?</p>
    <p>"Shut the door," Belem said. I got a feeling of tight-reined control from his mind superimposed upon mine. He was frightened, trying to keep panic down. "This is very simple," he said, perhaps as much to himself as to me. "The receiver in our laboratory is no longer working.</p>
    <p>"It can mean only one thing -- Paynter must have known all along where we were. Or he had access to those who did know. However he found us he must already have sent the weapon ahead." He didn't name the weapon, but I caught his mental picture of the golden marble in the glass box.</p>
    <p>"All right," I said. "That lets me out, then. We're finished."</p>
    <p>"Not at all." Belem's thought was sharp. "We must find the nearest receiver to the laboratory that works. It will be somewhere in the city. Then we must walk. There are secret entrances the government can't possibly have found yet. After all there hasn't been time for much to happen. But I must get back to my body and you'll be safer with us than with the government."</p>
    <p>"It looks more to me as if we'd be safe in jail together," I said.</p>
    <p>"Try the dials again," was all Belem replied.</p>
    <p>Someone was knocking impatiently on the door of the cubicle as the walls shimmered again and the long stretches of infinite space drew out between this world and the nameless place of the laboratory. I suppose the particles of my body dispersed along that path and reassembled again. I never did know much about how it worked. But when my head cleared I was in another room, smaller, square, smelling of machine oil. I opened the door.</p>
    <p>This was it. I remembered the strange, pale daylight, the bands of thin borealic light across the black sky, the double sun swinging far off and not very bright above the time-ruined city.</p>
    <p>But it was a very busy city this time. Men in uniform were hurrying through the streets in low square cars that floated without wheels, quite fast. Groups of them flickered and materialized and groups flickered and were gone at the transmission-centers which were this city's transportation system. Far off over the rusty roofs a cone of blue-white light, blinding in that dark daylight, seemed to clamp down over something at the city's edge -- I could guess what.</p>
    <p>"Hurry," Belem said in my mind. "Out here, around the next corner and step on the black disc in the pavement. If you move fast I don't think anyone will recognize you, though a cordon must be out for you by now. They'll expect us."</p>
    <p>"Me, not us," I said, dodging through the doorway. "I wouldn't be surprised if Paynter let me go and then trailed me with the idea I might lead him to you. He'll have a lot of explaining to do now that I'm missing. But he can't have guessed you were there -- more or less -- all the time. Here's the disc. Now what?"</p>
    <p>"Step on it," Belem said. "The dark half."</p>
    <p>The circle was six feet across, half dark, half palish.</p>
    <p>The pale half was unmarked, but the dark half had an arrow inlaid in it which was pointing right.</p>
    <p>I stepped gingerly on the arrow.</p>
    <p>I was standing on the pale half of a large disc. But not the same one. The buildings were different around me. A carload of soldiers drifted rapidly past toward one of the bigger discs, floated over it, centered and vanished.</p>
    <p>"At the next corner," Belem urged me. "Take the dark half again. Hurry!"</p>
    <p>Leap by miraculous leap I traversed the dark clear air of that curious city. And as I went it seemed to me I began to get a glimmer of the decoration which had once made it spectacular in its heyday, something one couldn't see from a single standpoint but grasped bit by bit as one went through great arcs and vistas of its streets.</p>
    <p>One bit at a time showed nothing but each leap through space, each glimpse from a different point, built up a little more of the plan in the memory, so that eventually a strange concept of the art emerged, a step farther than the architecture of my own day, when solids and surfaces were used. Here movement and distance were of equal importance. Like a moving picture, except that it was the city which stood still and the watcher who moved.</p>
    <p>Presently Belem halted me. We had come out near a fenced enclosure full of hunks of junked machinery, floating cars that still hovered motionless just off the ground, all their ribs showing, small lifeboats from beached spaceships, odds and ends of jetsam wholly nameless to me.</p>
    <p>"Over there, the little ship under the girders," Belem said. "Make sure nobody's watching, then climb into it."</p>
    <p>I did, wondering who had last sat in the tattered leather bucket-seat before the instrument panel, what he had seen through the glass, what wrecked liner and whirling stars. Belem interrupted the fancies impatiently. Under his orders I pushed the seat aside and pulled up a trap in the floor. A ladder went down.</p>
    <p>Nobody had discovered this passage yet, though I expected to find at any corner that somebody was waiting for me with a paralyzer that puffed rubber lips in and out. At the end I tapped a signal on a metal door and after awhile someone pulled it creaking open.</p>
    <p>The gigantically braced laboratory was blue with smoke and bluer with the blinding light of the cone that hung above it, glaring through the broad windows.</p>
    <p>Belem's motionless figure waited where he had left it.</p>

     <p>19. THE MARBLE</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>It was curious to look into his face and find it alien, he who had been so intimate a part of my mind. The emotionless features, the strange, quicksilver eyes belonged to De Kalb but the voice was -- as I pointed out to him -- the voice of Esau.</p>
    <p>He wasn't amused. He seemed to find his own body rather strange for a moment or two, for after he had left me he tried it out stiffly, moving to and fro with short steps.</p>
    <p>"You look like De Kalb," I said, watching him. "You move like De Kalb. Belem, were is De Kalb now?"</p>
    <p>He gave me a swift, strange, emotionless look. "I told you I was beginning to understand," he said. "I was. But I haven't the full answer yet and -- look, Cortland."</p>
    <p>I followed his gesture. The enormous room, braced with its monstrous girders, lay before us. There was orderly activity all through the vast place, centering around a control panel that might be the device creating the dome of light that shielded this area, a white wall curtaining off everything outside the windows. Sometimes coruscating flashes sparkled here and there along the curtain. Attacks -- failing? So little time had elapsed, really, since we left Paynter. This siege must be less than half an hour old and its full violence yet to come.</p>
    <p>Under a web of shimmering fire at the far side of the room the table still stood with a body stretched out on it. Here most of the figures were at work on their second-stage Mechandroid, waiting for it to come alive.</p>
    <p>"That's the most important thing that's happening here now," Belem said gravely. "I'm needed. I have no time nor mental energy to spare to solve your puzzles for you. Later, if we live, I'll try."</p>
    <p>He turned swiftly away from me and crossed the big room toward the table. I followed in silence.</p>
    <p>The second-stage Mechandroid lay quiet on its table, its eyes closed, the face serene and not quite human. There was, I thought, a remote familiarity about it too. Belem? I glanced at him, recognizing a likeness but not enough to explain the feeling that I had seen this man before. Man? Machine? Both and either.</p>
    <p>"Is he alive yet?" I asked.</p>
    <p>"It should take about four days more," one of the workers answered in English, speaking with mechanical precision. He sounded as if he had learned the language from records, so accurately that he reproduced even the buzz and click of the recording machine.</p>
    <p>"He is beginning to think and be alive already, but he will not be finished for four days. Before then our defenses will have gone down, I think. We haven't enough power to maintain the blocking screens for long."</p>
    <p>"Couldn't we all go out the way I came in?" I asked. "We could not take him along."</p>
    <p>"No, it's impossible. All we can do is defend ourselves as long as we can and hope to finish in time. I doubt if we will," he added casually.</p>
    <p>"The other time a second-stage Mechandroid was attempted," I said rather tactlessly, "they blew up the whole city, didn't they? Why don't they do it now?"</p>
    <p>"That was recognized as an error at the time," Belem told me. "They have improved siege weapons now and they will be curious about our devices. We must do the blowing up ourselves to prevent them when the time comes."</p>
    <p>"But you'll go right on working until -- "</p>
    <p>"Naturally." Belem sounded surprised. "There is a demonstrable mathematical chance that we may succeed. It would be foolish to throw such a chance away. I was set a problem, you see, and I must work to solve it as long as I am able to move and think. This is part of the solution -- this second-stage Mechandroid."</p>
    <p>"I should think," I said with even less tact, "that you'd have a sort of built-in block against making anything really dangerous to civilization."</p>
    <p>"So we have, within limits. This creation will not be basically destructive. Paynter is wrong. Human thinkers are very often wrong. The Man-Machine will endanger only obsolete things that should be destroyed. Humans ignore the obvious fact that machines can evolve exactly as men can. They have evolved.</p>
    <p>"What is a city but a machine? Sooner or later it would have been necessary to create a second-stage Mechandroid anyhow. The coming problems will be too complex for solution by either humans or Mechandroids."</p>
    <p>Belem looked down impassively at the serene sleeping face. Then he turned and walked away with a purposeful stride. I trailed him curiously. We ducked under girders and circled groups of workers who ignored us, reaching at last a rusty wall that opened under Belem's touch. I looked into the time-worn room of matter-transmission from which I had first glimpsed this scene.</p>
    <p>On the rusted floor a silver marble lay. That was all.</p>
    <p>"It was gold before," I said stupidly.</p>
    <p>"Simple transmutation. It's a tricky pattern of radio-elements."</p>
    <p>"It's so small," I said.</p>
    <p>"Pick it up."</p>
    <p>I tried. I could easily slip my fingers around it but it wouldn't budge. It might have been riveted to the floor.</p>
    <p>"Nothing -- no known force -- has power enough to move a negatively-charged activated matrix of this type," Belem said.</p>
    <p>"The well-known immovable body."</p>
    <p>"Eh?"</p>
    <p>"You know that paradox. What happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable body?"</p>
    <p>"But the existence of one automatically negates -- "</p>
    <p>"That's just my compensatory humor," I said. "I'm scared to death, so I'm joking." He didn't seem entirely satisfied. Well, neither was I.</p>
    <p>I kicked at the thing and hurt my toes.</p>
    <p>I can't describe that battle because I didn't understand what was going on. It was probably an epic. I couldn't tell. Outside the windows the shining wall occasionally sparkled and sometimes bells would ring and the needles on gauges would jump wildly. From outside our protective shell it was probably a more spectacular scene.</p>
    <p>Inside there wasn't even a feeling of tension because the Mechandroids went calmly about their duties and showed no sign of nervousness. Belem got busy on tasks of his own. I wandered around and watched, trying to make myself believe I was a war correspondent. Sometimes I went back and looked into the matter-transmitter at the silver marble. It just lay there.</p>
    <p>That was the strange, yet obvious point about this future -- I didn't understand the simplest basic things. I got glimpses of the Galaxy in operation, but I didn't know why it worked that way. A Neanderthaler legman on the Piltdown Chronicle might have had some similar difficulty in writing a feature story about Oak Ridge so his hairy readers could understand it.</p>
    <p>Well, with matter-transmission, you could live on a planet named South Nowhere, right on the edge of the Galaxy at the jumping-off-place, and yet be able to reach out your hand and pick up a California orange, practically fresh off the tree.</p>
    <p>Space didn't mean anything any more, so concepts of thinking based on familiar spatial frames of reference had to change. Except, perhaps, as far as initial exploration went. The first matter-transmitter had to be taken bodily to its destination. After that you could step into a transmitter on earth and step out on South Nowhere.</p>
    <p>So, in a war in this time, the trick was to immobilize your opponent. Nail him down -- as we were nailed down. After that, just keep pounding.</p>
    <p>What we needed was a claw-hammer to pull up that nail.</p>
    <p>I had seen enough of this future to begin thinking galactically. Stray thoughts crossed my mind -- random concepts involving yanking Centaurus II out of its orbit, clamping on a tractor-beam -- what the devil was a tractor-beam? -- and letting Centaurus pull up the silver marble, as a tractor pulls a mired car out of the ditch. I mentioned this idea to Belem. He said it was a striking bit of fantasy but not very practical -- and what was a tractor-beam?</p>
    <p>Discouraged, I sat down and thought some more.</p>
    <p>"What makes you think the second-stage Mechandroid can destroy the nekron?" I asked Belem.</p>
    <p>He kept working on a cryptic device composed chiefly of vari-colored lenses. His placid face never changed.</p>
    <p>"I can only hope so," he said. "He was designed expressly to solve that problem and he will have a fifty-five-power brain, compared to my twenty-power one. He'll be a tool -- an extension of the social mechanism."</p>
    <p>"With free will?"</p>
    <p>"Yes -- within obvious limits. He'll have to fulfill his purpose. He wouldn't be functional unless he did that."</p>
    <p>"What is his purpose? Besides destroying the nekron?"</p>
    <p>"I told you he was an extension. Like the specialized tool of your hand."</p>
    <p>"But I can control my hand."</p>
    <p>"Not always consciously," Belem pointed out. "If you suddenly found yourself falling your hand would seize the nearest grip. Extend that parallel a bit farther and imagine your hand has a brain of its own.</p>
    <p>"It will do -- within its limits -- what a hand can do best and it would know its potentialities better than you could. And it wouldn't try to rebel, because it's part of the unit. The second-stage Mechandroid is a better hand for humanity -- or a better brain in matters of intellect and logic."</p>
    <p>He turned to his work again, flashing lights on and off at what looked like random. After a moment he went on speaking.</p>
    <p>"As for the nekronic matter itself, it may be symbiotic or vampiric. I wonder. Thought and matter are very similar. It may be that nekronic matter has the potential ability to embody itself provided it finds a suitable host. It's significant that the creature itself is superficially manlike. Quite possibly it uses whatever prey it feeds on as a pattern from which to shape itself."</p>
    <p>"You think it feeds?'</p>
    <p>"You know as much as I about that. Probably more if you were capable of thinking the thing through. We don't know why the embodied nekronic entity kills. The most obvious solution is to replenish itself, to spread. Even a null-entropy organism might do that, in a sort of reverse pattern from the norm."</p>
    <p>He flashed a blue light thoughtfully and considered the results. So far as I could tell, there had been none but Belem seemed to fall into a minor trance for a few minutes, considering his work.</p>
    <p>I was watching a rift like black lightning that ran across the light-wall outside. A red cloud puffed through but the gap healed swiftly and the cloud was dissipated.</p>
    <p>Belem twisted a dial, bringing two lenses into sharper focus. "Very likely we'll never know," he said. "We can't last much longer now. A War Council has taken command of this planet."</p>
    <p>"Not Paynter?"</p>
    <p>"He's one of them. That's odd. They've outvoted him three times already on the question of attack. He doesn't want us destroyed -- which means he doesn't want you destroyed."</p>
    <p>"Nice of him," I said. "After he tried to kill me in the Subterrane."</p>
    <p>"Paralyze, not kill," Belem corrected.</p>
    <p>Silence after that, while Belem worked and I watched. "What would happen if you had time and material enough to make another of those marbles?" I inquired idly, after a while.</p>
    <p>"A great deal. Both matrix-weapons -- technically they're electronic matrices -- would be negatively charged, and would repel each other. Unfortunately we have neither time nor equipment for that."</p>
    <p>"What you need is a hacksaw to split that marble in two," I said. "Then they'd both change from immovable bodies to irresistible forces and shoot each other out of the galaxy. Right?"</p>
    <p>"Wrong. Besides being impossible it wouldn't help. You wouldn't have two electronic matrices of the same pattern as before. It's exactly the same reason why the second-stage Mechandroid wouldn't be dangerous to the social body. The whole is never larger than the sum of its parts, and the sum of the parts always equals the whole."</p>
    <p>"Then you never heard of Banach and Tarski," I said.</p>
    <p>"Who?"</p>
    <p>"Once I was assigned to write a feature science story on their experiment. I did plenty of research, because I had to find human interest in it somewhere and it was pure mathematics. The Banach-Tarski paradox, it was called -- a way of dividing a solid into pieces and reassembling them to form a solid of different volume."</p>
    <p>"I should remember that," Belem said, "since I have all your memories. It was only theoretical, wasn't it?" He searched my memory. I felt uncomfortable as though, under partial anaesthesia, I watched a surgeon investigating my digestive tract.</p>
    <p>"Theoretical, sure," I said. "But I did a repeat on the subject later. It took twenty-three years before somebody figured out how to apply the trick to a physical solid. I forget the details."</p>
    <p>"No you don't," Belem said, turning from his work and staring at me. "You have no control over your mind, that's all. But the information is stored there. Apparently I didn't get all the details when Paynter searched your memories. There's a name -- Robinson?"</p>
    <p>"It could be. I don't know."</p>
    <p>His face showed no change but I thought I sensed a growing excitement within him. "Cortland," he said, "I want to enter your mind again. I think -- "</p>

     <p>20. LAST DEFENSE</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Apparently he thought I might object -- not that that would have made any difference -- for the next thing I knew the quicksilver eyes were growing larger and the next instant they had changed and refocused so that I saw them, as it were, behind my own eyes. I could see the motionless body of Belem standing before me but his face was blanker than ever.</p>
    <p>Within my head, he spoke to me. "Remember. It's all there, in your memory. The right associations will recall it. The unconscious never forgets anything. Robinson. The University of -- "</p>
    <p>"California," I thought and something clicked and swung open and I saw a page open before me -- a page I had first read thousands of years ago -- and the fine print swam into remembered visibility.</p>
    <p>"Professor Raphael M. Robinson of the University of California now shows that it is possible to divide a solid sphere into a minimum of five pieces and reassemble them to form two spheres of the same size and the original one. Two of the pieces are used to form one of the new spheres and three to form the other.</p>
    <p>"Some of the pieces must necessarily be of such complicated structure that it is impossible to assign volume to them. Otherwise the sum of the volumes of the five pieces would have to be equal both to the volume of the original sphere and to the sum of the volumes of the two new spheres, which is twice as great."</p>
    <p>That was all. It wasn't as much as Belem would have liked -- I could feel his impatience and the way he seemed to be shaking my mind over for more details but I couldn't give him what I didn't have. After awhile the metallic mind unlinked from mine and in a moment the motionless figure before me stirred, turned without a word and began making tentative drawings on the corner of a chart convenient upon the wall.</p>
    <p>When I asked him questions he told me remotely to go away.</p>
    <p>That was how it started. There's no use in my trying to tell you how it ended. I didn't understand. It would be ridiculous for me even to pretend I know how it was done in concrete fact before my eyes. But it was done.</p>
    <p>Not easily. Not quickly. In fact it came dangerously close to not being done at all, simply because it took so long.</p>
    <p>I was able to watch the first stages of Belem's experiments. He knocked down the problem of lenses and lights upon which he'd spent so much time and began setting up theoretical paradoxes in three dimensions, following the Banach-Tarski geometric plan. I watched him playing with ghostly spheres and angles of light until my head began to ache from following the changing shapes. What he was attempting was clearly impossible. I wandered away after awhile and watched the play of lights outside. The display had recently become a lot more spectacular and more interesting to watch but that was not good. Even I could see that, though nobody would answer my questions. The methodical machine-men were not panicky but you could see they had accelerated their pace. They were recognizing the need for hurry.</p>
    <p>The second-stage Mechandroid on its table had changed, too. The brilliant neural webbing above it had simplified. Light ran now only in the main channels, letting the finer nerve-wires run very pale, but the synapse-points glowed like stars along the major lines.</p>
    <p>And there was a pale glow hanging like a cocoon of radiance low over the motionless figure.</p>
    <p>I watched little groups of workers cluster around it, bending their heads together over the table, and I had the impression that they were communicating with their new-born super-kinsman. I even got the idea that he was advising them, for those who left the group went directly to work with a fresh impetus.</p>
    <p>It was a little like what must go on in a hive as the workers cluster around the queen-mother.</p>
    <p>They were very definitely working against time now -- perhaps against hours, even minutes.</p>
    <p>It was when the black lightning opened a second rift in the wall of shielding light that the last galvanic spasm of activity before the end stirred the workers to their final tasks.</p>
    <p>Another red cloud puffed through the wall where the lightning had ripped it but this time the breach did not close. Instead, a horizontal pillar of red light lengthened through the smoke, unfolding straight toward the laboratory walls.</p>
    <p>It was then that a bell rang behind me.</p>
    <p>The effect was electrifying upon every Mechandroid in the building. Like everyone else I turned to stare. Belem was standing back from his work-table, a look of smugness upon his otherwise expressionless face.</p>
    <p>"This is it," he said.</p>
    <p>Even the crowd around the neural-web table thinned as the workers in the laboratory flocked around him to watch.</p>
    <p>He had a sphere about the size of a grapefruit, floating in mid-air above his table. He did things to it with quick flashes of light that acted exactly like knives, in that it fell apart wherever the lights touched, but I got the impression that those divisions were much less simple than knife-cuts would be. The light shivered as it slashed and the cuts must have been very complex, dividing molecules with a selective precision beyond my powers of comprehension.</p>
    <p>The sphere floated apart. It changed shape under the lights. I am pretty sure it changed shape in four dimensions, because after a while I literally could not watch any more. The shape did agonizing things to my eyes when I tried to focus on it.</p>
    <p>When I heard a long sigh go up simultaneously from the watchers I risked a look again.</p>
    <p>There were two spheres floating where one had floated before.</p>
    <p>"Amoebas can do it," I said. "What's so wonderful about reproduction by fission?"</p>
    <p>"Don't bother me," Belem said. "But get ready to leave when I give the word. There isn't much time left." He cast a worried glance at the window.</p>
    <p>All over the enormous room an orderly withdrawal was in progress. They had taken down the neural webbing over the big table and were setting up a lower webbing on the table itself, just within the radiation of that cocoon of light. I could see now that the table was no longer supported on legs but floated free of the floor. They were ready to move it, obviously, which must mean that matter-transmission was about to resume operation.</p>
    <p>"Take this tube," Belem said, "and go over to the transmitter. Careful, hold it with the blue side up. I'll be with you in a minute."</p>
    <p>"Even if you can do it again with the silver marble," I remarked, taking the tube, "can you be sure you'll be any better? Nothing much happened when these two spheres shaped up."</p>
    <p>"The marble, as you call it," Belem said, busily unhooking a glass spiral from its base, "is in effect an electron now, a negatively charged unit. Have you any idea how many tons of repulsion exist between cathode-ray particles, for instance, no matter how far apart they may be?</p>
    <p>"You're about to see a demonstration. The degree of repulsion is practically infinite for our purposes. When you get over there, open the transmitter door -- and hurry, will you?"</p>
    <p>The silver marble lay there on the floor of the transmitter, dully gleaming in the red light from the laboratory. The light was red because that cylinder of crimson had breached the protective radiations outside and was reaching inward, quivering back under the assaults of defense-lights, but stubbornly gaining yard by yard toward the laboratory wall.</p>
    <p>Belem worked methodically, setting up his tubes and prisms. The table cocooned with bright webbing floated now just beside the door, ready to go out first when transmission functioned again. I could see dimly the face of the sleeper inside. The serenity of that face was impressive in a way I can't describe.</p>
    <p>The second-stage Mechandroid slept, yes, but he wasn't wholly asleep now. The mind of the machine was awakening. It was time for it to wake. I could feel something in the very air that told me what was happening behind those impassive, emotionless features.</p>
    <p>The shape of the features disturbed me, too. There was that haunting familiarity which I had no time now to track down. But I knew I had seen it before.</p>
    <p>There wasn't much time for speculation. I think the laboratory defenses collapsed all at once. I heard no warning but overloaded screens suddenly went down with blinding soundless lashes between us and the attacking forces. I think Belem must have been drawing heavily on the power-reserves in order to finish his experiment in geometric paradox.</p>
    <p>He didn't seem surprised, nor did the others, when there was a dazzle of red and green brilliance in conflict, streaming like colored lightnings through the vast room, making the twisted girders stand out in black silhouette. One of the Mechandroids at Belem's elbow said something in one of the languages of this age which meant nothing to me.</p>
    <p>Belem asked him a question. I caught the name of Paynter in the answer.</p>
    <p>Belem moved a prism. His voice was quick but very calm. And this time as he spoke I caught an overtone in the air which the others perhaps, had been realizing for some minutes. I can't say what it was. A pressure, a deep, serene wave, a quality of newness and difference too intangible to name.</p>
    <p>But it was there. After a moment or two I knew what it was.</p>
    <p>The sleeper was awake. Not physically yet. His body remained helpless in the cocoon of light. But the mind was speaking to the minds of his creators, a smooth strong mind functioning like perfect, machinery with a deep hum of power.</p>
    <p>Belem laid down his tools and turned to me, gripped my arm, urged me away toward a sloping catwalk that spanned the great room.</p>
    <p>"What's the matter?" I asked in bewilderment, following him willy-nilly, because I could feel the metal of his machine-ancestry in that tight grip. "Something wrong? Won't the gadget work?"</p>
    <p>"It will work. You and I are needed elsewhere now. The others can handle the escape."</p>
    <p>"But I wanted to watch -- "</p>
    <p>"There is no time. You won't see the demonstration, after all."</p>
    <p>I looked at him dubiously. There seemed to be no threat in his tone, but then there never was.</p>
    <p>"What's happening?"</p>
    <p>"A platoon of men is attacking under Paynter. We must hold them back until the matter-transmitter is reactivated. I'm acting under orders. The second-stage Mechandroid is conscious enough to take charge. He told me what to do -- look!"</p>

     <p>21. INFECTION SPREADING</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>And that was when the last defense of all went down. There was a blazing flash of crimson that seemed to lick every corner of the room. It died and the white-lit air trembled a little in its wake. But only for an instant.</p>
    <p>Then, from somewhere outside, a spear of red light drove at us and, almost concurrently, a steel piston, ten feet thick, shot out like a battering-ram after it. I had a single glimpse of that blank solid-steel muzzle rushing forward like a Titan's fist -- then it crashed through the wall of the building, with a thunderous impact and a shriek of torn and twisted metal, and ripped an irresistible path through the great girders.</p>
    <p>It halted.</p>
    <p>That cylinder of metal must have been more than half a mile long. Thirty feet of it extended through the riven wall into the chamber where we stood.</p>
    <p>The blank muzzle opened like a shutter. Through a transparent wall I saw a little room banked with intricate control boards, and Paynter in a bucket-seat, his eyes shielded by darkened lenses, his mouth drawn down in a grimace as his hands moved swiftly across the panel before him.</p>
    <p>A section of the cylinder dropped away. From its interior came leaping men, hooded and armored 'by light-colored suits of webbing. Each carried one of the basket-hilted paralysis-weapons.</p>
    <p>I risked a look behind me. Far away, down a long vista of arched girders, I could see the Mechandroids gathered in a little group about the floating platform on which the second-stage Mechandroid lay and I thought that quick flashes of light were moving there -- the same knife-like stabs of brightness I had seen when Belem divided his experimental sphere.</p>
    <p>But the soldiers of Paynter were getting dangerously close -- more than a score of them, inhuman and frightening in their hoods and protective suits.</p>
    <p>Deliberately Belem turned his back on the soldiers running toward us and looked at me.</p>
    <p>Twice before I had had this experience. But it wasn't a trick you could get used to -- the quicksilver eyes expanding, rushing forward, slipping, inside your head -- and, impossibly, moving into place like supplementary lenses so that Belem was looking out through my own eyes, from within my mind.</p>
    <p>I felt his will grip mine with paralyzing strength. Perhaps he thought I might resist. Certainly I would have, had I known what he intended.</p>
    <p>Then he had control of my brain as well as my body. Belem's thought? But they were my own thoughts -- superimposed, directing --</p>
    <p>He was using my mind, as he might use a telegraph-key, to send out a message -- a summons.</p>
    <p>I had time only to realize what it was Belem was calling. There was no time to react, to fight the summons -- for the answer came almost upon the heels of the call.</p>
    <p>From high above the great room I could see that answering shadow sweep into sight. It came out of nowhere, literally out of nowhere, springing into being and moving for- ward with a speed so blinding I could not focus upon it. I had again that instant of recognition, of revulsion -- that knowledge of its burning speed.</p>
    <p>And then the nova of pure energy exploded outward, as it had done so many times before, from somewhere in the center of my consciousness.</p>
    <p>But this time it was different. Never before had the thing been deliberately summoned. Whatever it was, from wherever it came, it had always before struck of its own will. Now it struck through mine -- through Belem's, speaking with my mind. And that gave it a significance and a quality of culmination which its coming had never had before. This time it meant something. This time, perhaps, I would know. The shock of energy blinded me. I waited for the fading to begin.</p>
    <p>There was no fading. Instead a second shock followed close upon the first, then another and another -- wave after rising wave, tide upon tide of devouring violence. Nothing like this had ever happened before. I was too sick and shaken with the overloading of my nerves, the staggering blows of sensation that battered me. I could not think or reason. I only knew that this time I was lost, drowned in the bursting violence.</p>
    <p>It would not cease. It would never cease. It would go on forever ...</p>
    <p>I saw the shadow of violence fade from a face. Across what seemed to be wide distances I saw the reflection of unimaginable violence ebb. Yes -- the mind behind that face had known the staggering onrush of inhuman tides as deeply as my own.</p>
    <p>In the control room of the great steel cylinder Paynter met my gaze -- and I read sick horror in his eyes.</p>
    <p>I could not move. Every nerve in my body felt burned out, short-circuited. I could see and hear a little; that was all. I saw Belem clambering up into the hollow side of the huge piston.</p>
    <p>In a moment he appeared behind Paynter. Paynter, I thought, tried to move. His stare broke away from mine. But the Mechandroid's hands darted out, touching Paynter's neck, his head, his spine. Belem spoke a word and took Paynter's shoulder as the latter rose.</p>
    <p>Belem's quicksilver eyes were no longer within my mind, I realized.</p>
    <p>But I wasn't thinking clearly. I had forgotten the armored soldiers.</p>
    <p>Now I saw them. They were quite dead, all of them. I saw how they had died. I remembered the chain of bursting explosions as the killing shadow had swept down from above.</p>
    <p>It was gone now -- but it had fed well.</p>
    <p>Belem and the silent obedient figure of Paynter came toward me. I felt the Mechandroid's fingers reach out and probe deeply into my flesh. There was brief pain, then I could move again. But I still could not think very clearly. Belem seemed to be listening to a voice I couldn't hear, He said, as if to himself, "There isn't much time -- " and urged both of us forward. Now that I turned, I could see that the matter-transmission chamber at the other end of the room was empty. The crowding Mechandroids with their slowly waking Sleeper had gone. They had stepped, in so many instants, from this place to some other planet that might be anywhere at all in the immeasurable vastness of the Galaxy.</p>
    <p>"Come," Belem said and we moved toward the matter-transmitter.</p>
    <p>The rusted metal walls shimmered around us, faded, vanished.</p>
    <p>Across the depths of space the atoms that made us up dispersed, drew out, reintegrated again. Bright alloy plates shimmered into being. We had stepped again from one world to another.</p>
    <p>Belem pushed the panel open. We stepped out -- into a cavern of dusty rock.</p>
    <p>On the floor at our feet a little glittering tree stood motionless, beside it a flat metal sheet with wire bars. Belem sighed with satisfaction.</p>
    <p>"I didn't think they could do it," he said. "Word went out to one of us in the laboratories to get these things replaced but I didn't really think -- well, there just isn't much time. Cortland, bring Paynter here, please."</p>
    <p>I obeyed, moving in a curious dreamlike state, the aftermath perhaps of that monstrous rapport with the slaying shadow. Belem was kneeling beside the barred device dial Dr. Essen had used to create the vibratory matrix that had isolated us from space.</p>
    <p>"Useless," he said. "As I half suspected." I looked up at the enclosing walls of stone, beyond which my own home planet stretched. It was curiously comforting to know that the rock overhead and the rock underfoot were the native structure of Earth. Here, on this uneven floor, my own body had fallen to dust.</p>
    <p>I wondered if the drifts in which our feet left prints had once been --</p>
    <p>"This is the cave of the time-axis, then," I said slowly. "And it's no good. Not if you can't work the machine Dr. Essen used. Is it too complicated even for you, Belem? I should have thought -- "</p>
    <p>"That isn't the problem. It's comparatively simple, really. The trouble amounts to personalized mental mutation. We could understand how a thing as simple as a Neanderthaler's battle hammer worked but we couldn't use it -- we don't have the same muscular training and balance. And mental habits are far more subtle.</p>
    <p>"An invention, in practical application, fits its age and the people of that age. By studying this apparatus, I could work back to the basic principle and construct something similar that would operate in my hands. But only Dr. Essen could use the device that's so completely hers. In effect it's an extension of her mind. And we're in a hurry. I've had to make other plans."</p>
    <p>He glanced toward the closed panel of the transmitter and before he had finished speaking, it began to open. I think there was some mental warning which Mechandroids could exchange over considerable distances. Belem put a restraining hand on my arm as a second Mechandroid stepped into the cavern. He came directly from some world of dust and wind, for his hair was wildly blown and a reddish dust shook from his garments as he moved. He carried very carefully in both hands a milky-white crystalline egg.</p>
    <p>Without a word he came forward, put it in Belem's hands and turned back to the transmitter. It sighed shut behind him and he was gone -- back, perhaps, to the wind and dust of his unknown world.</p>
    <p>Gingerly Belem laid the crystalline globe on the floor between the glass tree and the useless Essen device.</p>
    <p>"This will do what has to be done," he said, looking down at it. "Give us a temporary force-field. It doesn't tap the basic cosmic energies as Dr. Essen's does but I hope it will protect us long enough. After the second-stage Mechandroid wakes we'll be safe. He can take over."</p>
    <p>"And do what?" I asked, a little rebelliously. "Keep us asleep, set up a matrix to guard us -- sure. And then send us in to the future? Maybe I don't want to go any more. What good could I do there alone? De Kalb's gone. Dr. Essen's gone. Even Murray would have been more help than nobody. As it is, I'd rather stay right here. It looks like an interesting world, what little I've managed to see of it. If you hadn't interfered I think I could have got along very well with Paynter."</p>
    <p>"Except for one thing," he said calmly. "You're a carrier of the nekronic infection, as I think the People of the Face may have planned from the beginning. As a spur to prevent just what you've suggested."</p>
    <p>"Why are you going, then?" I demanded. "It has nothing to do with you."</p>
    <p>"Yes, it does have. Two things. First -- I don't know why I'm going. The order came and I must obey it."</p>
    <p>"From the second-stage Mechandroid?" I asked incredulously.</p>
    <p>"Yes. The second reason is" -- He looked up at me over his shoulder. He was kneeling to puzzle over the Essen machine, and gave me a sudden cool smile. "I go under orders," he said. "You go because of the nekronic spur. Do you know why Paynter must go too?"</p>
    <p>"Because you've got him hypnotized," I said. "Why else?"</p>
    <p>"Paynter is infected too." I gaped at him.</p>
    <p>"Of course he is. Why else did he fail to kill you when he knew the danger you carried wherever you went? But suppose he had killed you -- and the murders went on? The authorities would have had to look further -- they would have found Paynter himself. So long as you lived, you were the obvious scapegoat."</p>
    <p>"All right," I said slowly. "It adds up. Is that the reason why he has to go with us? Does your second-stage age Mechandroid care about that?"</p>
    <p>"Of course not." Belem had turned from the mystifying Essen machine and was working carefully with the milky-crystal globe now, his large fingers moving over it with the same clumsy deftness I had watched so often in De Kalb's identical fingers.</p>
    <p>"Of course not. The real reason is very different. You've probably guessed it already. Do you not know, really, why you have trusted me so far? If your mind had put up any real opposition, I couldn't have done all I did with it. Don't you know why you and I must go on to the world of the Face together -- as you first set out to do?"</p>
    <p>I stood there in the dusty cavern, in perfect silence, not surprised to find that I was trembling a little as his metal eyes met mine. After a long time I said, very softly, in a shaken, questioning voice, "De Kalb -- De Kalb?"</p>
    <p>"I think so," he said calmly. Then he reached out and with one finger stirred the heavy dust on the floor. He looked at me, smiling wryly. "De Kalb is there. De Kalb is that. But here -- " He struck his head a light rap, "Here I think he still lives. Latent. In abeyance. But still here."</p>
    <p>I sat down suddenly, in the dust that may once have been Jerry Cortland. I was remembering the sudden oblivion hat had briefly overtaken all of us who were duplicates of the sleepers in the cave as those original bodies fell apart.</p>
    <p>"There would be no reason for you to go on to the World of the Face alone," he said, "if you went alone. But you won't. You can't. You never have been alone, have you, in his era? Always Topaz -- who is Dr. Essen, asleep -- or Paynter, who is Murray, asleep, or I -- who am De Kalb -- were with you. None of us knew. All of us have been moving along the lines of some pattern vaster than we can guess. Only now it begins to emerge a little."</p>
    <p>As I drew a breath to speak, the sound of the opening panel startled us both. Only Paynter, standing motionless in be grip of his hypnosis, did not move. My quick start was futile but Belem's two hands covered the crystal globe, ready, I think, to activate it and throw out the temporary force-field that would isolate us from attack -- for awhile.</p>

     <p>22. REUNION</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>We were both expecting soldiers to come pouring from the transmitter. But no one came through the open panel. Instead, a voice spoke. A woman's voice, cool, clear, level.</p>
    <p>"Ira?" it said. "Mr. Cortland? Colonel Murray, are you there?"</p>
    <p>Dr. Essen! I thought. Letta Essen! An instant later Topaz came alone across the threshold.</p>
    <p>It was Topaz and yet -- it was Letta Essen too, more clearly than I had ever seen her before in the girl's amazingly adaptable features.</p>
    <p>"I expected this," Belem said with perfect calm. "I didn't even send for her, I was so sure she would have to come. It's the pattern, Cortland. It's working itself out faster and faster now, beyond our control, I think. Is she Letta Essen?"</p>
    <p>I nodded in bewilderment. The voice was not Dr. Essen's, of course, for it came from the vocal cords of Topaz, but it was not Topaz's voice either. It was cool, emotionless, nobody's voice. Dispassion speaking aloud. And the face was Topaz's face but changed, different.</p>
    <p>I had seen the almost fluid mobility with which every emotion altered those lovely features but I had not been prepared for a change like this. And the ego, the soul, of Topaz was submerged. A tight, wary blackness was all that showed now -- that and a sort of bright alarm.</p>
    <p>"The soldiers!" she was saying a little breathlessly now, as she hurried toward us across the dust which was her own disintegrated body. "They're following me, Ira. It is Ira?" Her eyes were questioning on Belem's face.</p>
    <p>The Mechandroid nodded. "They're following you?" he demanded. "How much do they know? Never mind -- you can tell us later. Activate your machine -- quickly!" And he gestured toward it.</p>
    <p>She dropped to her knees beside the metal plate, hesitated, touched it doubtfully. "The connections have been changed," she said. "I can put them back in order but" -- she glanced up -- "it may take time."</p>
    <p>"How long?"</p>
    <p>"Too long." She looked from face to face, a little of Topaz's facile despair coming through the calm. "The soldiers -- " Belem's breath hissed through his teeth. We turned, seeing the panel in the wall opening again. Bright uniforms gleamed through the gap.</p>
    <p>Belem's hands flashed with blinding speed above the crystal egg. Then a tower of golden light shot up like a fountain and spread out above us. It thinned as it spread, came showering down again into an enclosing hemisphere. Its brightness faded until we were looking through amber glass at the soldiers who came swarming from the transmitter, more and more with every opening and closing of the panel. Their weapons spat fire at us.</p>
    <p>A burst of starry light sparkled on the amber of our shield and died. Another nova flared and faded against the screen. And another.</p>
    <p>"We're safe," Belem said calmly. "For a few days, until the power dies. By then the second-stage Mechandroid should waken. But meanwhile, Dr. Essen -- you had better repair your machine if you can."</p>
    <p>She nodded, the bright curls tumbling. Then she rose and stepped carefully around the motionless, glittering tree toward the milky egg that was projecting our temporary salvation.</p>
    <p>"I can't remember -- very clearly," she said. "There was light -- and then suddenly I knew I was myself -- with some memories of a girl called Topaz." She frowned. "Maybe it would be clearer if -- may I see your projector, Ira? Belem? Which are you, now?" She looked searchingly into his face.</p>
    <p>"I am Belem," the Mechandroid said. "Do you know what it was that roused you out of the Topaz-state and reawakened the Essen mind? We are nearly sure now that, in the moment the time-axis shell and the sleeping bodies inside it crumbled, their sleeping minds merged with the minds of the physical duplicates. Why is not yet known. Why the minds of Paynter, Topaz and myself remained dominant while Cortland's submerged the mind of his host is still -- "</p>
    <p>He paused. For Topaz -- Dr. Essen -- was bending above the luminous egg. Now she seized it, lifted it high, and with one smooth gesture smashed it against the rocky floor.</p>
    <p>It was Topaz, of course -- not Letta Essen, never Letta Essen.</p>
    <p>The amber shell above us began to rift and shimmer into tatters. Beyond it the armed men pressed forward, shouting. A lance of hot white light shot past Belem's head and spattered fire from the rocky wall behind him. Topaz laughed, a shrill, high sound of pure excitement.</p>
    <p>Then Belem moved.</p>
    <p>He fell to one knee beside the shattered globe from which amber light was dying swiftly. His hands settled down over it, heedless of the sharp, cutting edges of the broken crystal. And his body began to glow.</p>
    <p>Swiftly the rifted light in the shell above us began to mend itself. The amber shining spread, met, joined. The armor strengthened, was solid again.</p>
    <p>I could feel the tremendous energy pouring out of the Mechandroid's mind and body. It made the air quiver inside the hemisphere. As a man may suicidally bridge a gap between two charged electric wires, so Belem was using himself now. I saw him shudder as that frightful energy poured through him.</p>
    <p>Paynter, forgotten in the melee, suddenly stirred beside us. I saw him take an uncertain step forward, then another, the blankness fading from his face. Belem's mind was losing control over his. Released from the hypnosis, active now, our enemy -- he emerged from his paralysis.</p>
    <p>From outside the shell that was our only hope the confused shouts of the soldiers came thinly. One voice rose above the rest, an officer's voice, full of urgent command.</p>
    <p>"Topaz!" it shouted. "Topaz -- stop the Mechandroid!"</p>
    <p>Her quick response made double clear what had been clear enough before. She was wholly their tool. She had never been Letta Essen. Their integrators had worked out the truth as quickly as the Mechandroids had fathomed it and Topaz was a ready instrument to their hands. She was still their most dangerous weapon and she had not failed yet.</p>
    <p>I heard her high, clea laughter, in response to the call and I whirled in time to see her snatch out a tiny, glittering weapon exactly like that rubber-lipped paralyzer Paynter had once turned upon me. This was smaller and it glittered with jewels and the flexible ring of its muzzle was fantastically colored. But it was no toy. I saw the lips suck in as she pressed its trigger, ready to send out a web of paralyzing force upon Belem.</p>
    <p>The Mechandroid neither saw nor heard. All his mind was concentrated on keeping the force-field active. He was depending wholly on me.</p>
    <p>I flung out an arm just in time to throw Topaz off balance. The bright-lipped weapon spat out its web, which floated just clear of Belem and flared into violent oblivion against the amber shell around us. Topaz hissed savagely at me and fought to level her weapon again at Belem. She was lithe and astonishingly strong, a protean shape that writhed snake-like in my arms.</p>
    <p>There wasn't anything I could do about Paynter. He was almost fully awake, and reaching half dazedly for the gun at his belt. Topaz, twisting furiously, was trying now to center her paralyzing weapon on me. Above us the shell of force began to tatter again. There was a limit to Belem's powers.</p>
    <p>My mind, ranging wildly for an answer, stumbled upon the mad thought of re-hypnotizing Paynter. I knew I had not the power but -- suddenly my glance fell upon the glittering little tree at my feet. There in its base was the switch I had once seen De Kalb press, a thousand years ago.</p>
    <p>After three tries I reached it with my toe. Topaz was a furiously writhing burden in my arms, almost overbalancing us both. But the jeweled branches lighted, began slowly to move.</p>
    <p>"Paynter!" I barked. "Look at that -- look at it!"</p>
    <p>He was not yet fully out of his hypnosis. He turned, startled, saw the branches that were spinning now with a dizzying blur of brightness. He grimaced and looked away.</p>
    <p>Recklessly I let go of Topaz with one arm to point at the whirling tree.</p>
    <p>"Look!" I yelled insistently. "Paynter, look."</p>
    <p>My own eyes were averted but I could see his head turn as he glanced at the hypnotic spinning. His head turned away again, slightly -- but not his eyes. They stayed fixed, focused on lie tree.</p>
    <p>Slowly, slowly his head swung back, till he stood facing the circling lights. Intelligence faded from his stare. His hand dropped from his belt.</p>
    <p>Simultaneously I realized that Topaz was no longer fighting me. She too was watching the tree.</p>
    <p>Hypnotized -- both of them.</p>
    <p>Paynter said in a dazed voice, "Cortland -- Cortland, is that you? De Kalb? What's happening?"</p>
    <p>"Murray?" I said, softly, tentatively. I knew it was probably a trick and yet -- under the hypnosis of the tree the submerged mind of Murray might be wakening.</p>
    <p>Belem let out a long, shuddering sigh. His body slumped. And the amber force-field about us seemed to run down like water and vanished. Across the suddenly cleared space the soldiers stared at us, caught for a second by surprise. Their eyes sought Paynter's.</p>
    <p>But they met Murray's eyes. "Wait!" he barked at them sharply. "Halt!"</p>
    <p>Confused, they fell back a little. They would obey him -- for a moment. So long as they thought he was Paynter.</p>
    <p>Was he Paynter?</p>
    <p>He turned a bewildered gaze to me, murmuring thickly, "Cortland, what's happened? I've been dreaming, haven't I? Dreaming I was a man named Paynter?"</p>
    <p>There was a restless surge among the soldiers. They were muttering to their officers, uncertain, ready to be swayed one way or the other. Paynter -- Murray -- turned back to them.</p>
    <p>"Halt!" he shouted again. "Wait for your orders!"</p>
    <p>It worked -- for awhile. But they would not wait long. Commands could not stop them from thinking. And I knew that if Murray told them to drop their weapons their indecision would crystallize into disobedience.</p>
    <p>But the solution was very simple after all.</p>
    <p>A gray light flickered around us, vanished, steadied again. A thin humming began. The light seemed to gather upon every dust-mote in the air, thickening in veil beyond veil. The soldiers faded into misty ghosts ...</p>
    <p>Belem lifted his head wearily. "We're all here now," he said. "Cortland, Murray -- "</p>
    <p>" -- Dr. Letta Essen -- "</p>
    <p>Only then did I turn my head. Kneeling beside the original force-field device was Topaz, her fingers flickering over its controls.</p>
    <p>Not Topaz, I thought. Not now. The face was hers, and the body, but when she glanced up and smiled it was Letta Essen's keen gray eyes that met mine. Hypnosis had released her, as it had released Murray, from the prison of the alien bodies, the alien minds.</p>
    <p>"Now I will join you," Belem said, and turned to face the spinning tree.</p>
    <p>There was silence under the dome of gray light.</p>
    <p>When the Mechandroid turned he was still a man-machine but it was De Kalb who looked at us out of the metal eyes. He smiled. "Goodbye to Belem," he said. "We're here again, all of us."</p>
    <p>"But why did it happen -- why?" Letta Essen spoke with the voice of Topaz but it was unmistakably her own mind framing the thought and the words.</p>
    <p>"I think I can guess," De Kalb said, through Belem's lips. "It was no accident that stranded us temporarily in this era. We set out to fight a battle, the four of us against the nekron. Well, I think we have fought that battle. I think what happened was a testing-field in which each of us was tried and found -- useful. Now we go on to the final battle."</p>
    <p>"And the nekronic killer with us," I said.</p>
    <p>"The killer too. That is part of the pattern, I think."</p>
    <p>"But wait a minute," Murray said. "What's become of this fellow Paynter? Where's Belem? Where's Topaz? And Cortland, were you always yourself?"</p>
    <p>"The others are recessive in our minds, I think," De Kalb said. "Just as once we were recessive in theirs. Cortland's alter ego has always been recessive. Only he hasn't changed -- except in that he changed bodies, as we all did. Why that had to happen I don't know -- yet. Remember, Cortland has always been our catalyst. When he enters the picture things happen!"</p>
    <p>"There's one thing that isn't going to happen," I said. "We can't get our bodies back, can we? These we borrowed. Or stole, if you want the accurate truth. The real owners are sleeping, maybe. But will we ever dare sleep? Will we ever be sure well waken as ourselves? Each of us is a double mind in a single body now. If we come out alive from the world of the Face, what's going to happen then?"</p>
    <p>"We'll know that," De Kalb said firmly, "when we wake again. We will sleep, Cortland. And whichever ego wakes at the end of the world will be the ego that was predestined to wake."</p>
    <p>He hesitated briefly. "Now we must go," he said. "Look at the tree, Cortland. Murray, Letta -- watch the tree. We will know the real truth -- but later, much later -- when we waken at the end of the world. When we look into the Face of Ea."</p>

     <p>23. THE FACE</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Time turned on and on upon its axis where we slept.</p>
    <p>Time flowed like a river, wheeled like a sphere, moved like a galaxy through its own unimaginable dimensions toward its own inexorable ends. Motionless at the heart of motion, we slept on.</p>
    <p>I think I dreamed.</p>
    <p>Perhaps it was a dream in which the waters of time parted above us like a Red Sea parting and, through the walls of water, inquiring faces looked down into mine, mouthed words in unknown languages that came to me faintly from far away. If it was a dream, the dream wore thin for an interval and I could almost hear them, almost feel their hands on me, tugging me awake.</p>
    <p>And then, among them, a deep serene powerful command seemed to break and through the parted waters of sleep and time I looked up dimly into the face I had last seen beneath the cocoon of fight, still in its natal slumber. But this time I saw the calm quicksilver eyes and heard the calm voice running deep with power.</p>
    <p>The eyes met mine. Their command was irresistible, and the command was --</p>
    <p>Sleep.</p>
    <p>The waters closed over me again ...</p>
    <p>As dreams repeat themselves in interrupted slumber, it seemed to me that this dream returned. The quiet of turning time wore thin and I looked up again into inquisitive faces seen from far away, felt inquisitive hands plucking me awake. But these were strange faces, so strange I was startled a little out of my oblivion and all but sat up in my shock as I saw them.</p>
    <p>Above the clustering misshapen heads the great calm figure of the Man-Machine loomed. I knew him by his eyes and by the deep humming tide of power that flowed from his mind to mine, silencing the chatter, healing over the breach in time. But I would not have known him, I think, except for that.</p>
    <p>For long eons had passed in that measureless interval. The serene face was changing. But the tide of his command had not changed at all. He still said to me, "Sleep," and I slept again.</p>
    <p>Once more the dream returned. This time it was not faces that looked down at me but small, sharp, twinkling lights, insistent, deeply troubling. And as I roused enough to turn my head aside, trying to escape them, I had one glimpse of quicksilver eyes beneath calm brows, one remote echo of a voice that rolled like thunder. The lights vanished like candle-flames in a hurricane.</p>
    <p>The thunder was so deep that it had tangible volume, rolled from a tangible source. I knew how mighty the source was. I knew, from that glimpse of the quicksilver eyes, how tremendously they had changed. The Man-Machine was no longer the size and shape of man. The face had changed, the functions had changed, the size was too vast for my dazed mind to comprehend.</p>
    <p>"Sleep," the thunder commanded through diminishing vistas of space and time. And this time I sank into depths so profound that no dreams could plumb them.</p>
    <p>I had thought that, when the time came, I would have much to write about the Face of Ea, that stands in the twilight of the world's end. But now, when I try, the words are hard to find. I have seen things no human being ever saw before. But the paradox is that it can't be communicated. Between experience and inexperience lies a gulf that can be bridged in one way and one way only.</p>
    <p>You would have to go, as we went, to time's end and stand before the Face of Ea. Then I could tell you what I saw -- and then I wouldn't need to tell you, for you would know.</p>
    <p>I awoke.</p>
    <p>The long, long sleep drained slowly out of my mind, like water receding down a sloping beach, leaving me stranded in a place I had never seen before. This was the time-axis -- but it had changed. I looked with blank eyes around the dome that closed us in, a thin, gray dome through which red light filtered. We were no longer underground. I suppose the mountains had worn away, grain by grain, while we slept.</p>
    <p>Murray's was the first face I saw. I thought to myself, "Is it Murray this time or is it Paynter?" I watched him sit up on the gray floor, rubbing his face dazedly, his flesh pink in that filtering light. And I never knew whether it was Murray or Paynter.</p>
    <p>Beyond him De Kalb looked at me with metallic eyes, smiled and sat up. And Topaz lifted her bright curls from the dusty floor and turned swiftly from face to face, a glance that combined Letta Essen and herself in indissoluble unison.</p>
    <p>"Are we there?" she asked in a soft voice.</p>
    <p>For answer I gestured toward the gray dome that shut us in, the world outside the dome.</p>
    <p>As far as we could see, in every direction but one, the world lay flat and gray with a surface very familiar to us all in one way or another. A glazed grayness, solid, through which veins of rosy color, like curled hair, twined at random. The world was all nekronic matter now -- except for one other thing.</p>
    <p>We looked up at the Face of Ea, and we were silent.</p>
    <p>As we looked, the dome above us shimmered, thinned, was gone. Down upon us the red twilight poured unbroken. It was faintly warm upon the skin. A very faint wind blew past us and I can remember still the strange hollow odors it carried, wholly unlike anything I had ever scented before from winds blowing over open country.</p>
    <p>We did not speak again, any of us. The time for talk had passed and a higher authority from that moment took all initiative out of our hands. We looked up at the Face of Ea.</p>
    <p>How can I tell you what it was like -- now? You know how I saw it in the Record, when the images of this same scene recreated themselves in my mind and I looked up from this same spot, in a faraway age, into the towering Face. Even then I saw it as a Face far transcending the human, reflecting experiences unknown to my era and my world, complex beyond any possible human guessing.</p>
    <p>When I looked up now and saw the vast cliffside rising above the gray nekronic plain, it was not as a Face I saw it. Not at first. It was too complex to be recognizable. It was shaped into equations so far beyond my comprehension that I could not read them in terms of a human likeness.</p>
    <p>I suppose a Piltdown man, gazing from under his eye-ridges at the face of a Toynbee or an Einstein would realize only very remotely that this was the face of an evolved member of his own species. And there were greater gulfs than that between the Face and me.</p>
    <p>You will have guessed already what likeness it was that I finally recognized. I should have guessed too. It was not very surprising, really. Belem had given me the clue. A city, he had told me, was simply a machine for human living, an extension of the Mechandroid organism. And this city, which was the Face. It looked down at us with a vast calm gaze, the same gaze that had brooded over our slumbers while time turned on its axis where we slept. The eyes that had once been quicksilver metal were very different now but I knew that gaze. The voice that had once run deeper and deeper with the volume of its power was a voice no longer, for it had passed beyond the need for a voice. The thing that had once been a Man-Machine had grown, developed, changed, synthesized with all of human living as the millennia went by.</p>
    <p>Its functions had broadened to encompass every aspect of the civilizations through which it passed.</p>
    <p>I understood very little of the complex symbiosis which had taken place, and I can convey only a very small part of what I understood. For mankind had changed too. Perhaps love and hate and fear survived but not in the forms we know. Perhaps human features were not so different as we imagined. Perhaps, through the streets and plazas of the city, which had begun as a Man-Machine and was now the cradle of the surviving race, men and women like ourselves really did move still.</p>
    <p>I'm not sure. I walked the streets. But I am still not sure among what crowds I walked.</p>
    <p>I've said the Face no longer needed a voice. This is why. In the old days I suppose the Man-Machine would have said, "Come," when it wanted us nearer. Now in effect it said, "Come" -- and we came. But not on foot. Not under our own directions.</p>
    <p>A whole segment of unnecessary, primitive activities was simply eliminated. There was no need for the clumsy human mechanisms to hear the summons, comprehend it, consider it, debate obeying, decide to comply, set muscles in motion and trudge across the plain.</p>
    <p>Instead, the Face issued its voiceless command -- and there was a sort of vortex in the red twilight air between the cliff-side and ourselves. Smoothly, gently, inexorably, we were drawn up along that spinning of the air, seeing the gray earth fall away beneath us and then slide backward with blurring swiftness. The Face grew startlingly larger, too large to see as a whole, large and near and very clear.</p>
    <p>We lost sight of the tremendous serene brow, of the vast smooth chin, of the great downward slope of the nose, of the cheeks etched with experiences which no human and no machine could ever have known separately.</p>
    <p>Walls of rock rushed at us, opened, sucked us in.</p>
    <p>What did I see? I wish I could tell you. I can make useless sketches in the air with both hands, trying to show how the spiral streets sloped and how the blurred house-fronts slid past. But if I did you would picture ordinary house-fronts and a street that curved but was like any street you know. And these were too different to describe.</p>
    <p>It may be that the street really did move with all its strange shapely houses. I have an idea that the whole interior of the city was actually in constant motion, as a machine might be, and that if motion ceased they would cease too, the city and the race of man.</p>
    <p>But I can tell you this much. Ideas blew through that city like puffs of smoke through an industrial town. They brushed my mind and were gone, leaving only bewildering fragments in their wake. Sometimes they brushed two of us at once and we had incredible glimpses into one another's minds wherever the idea touched, evoking mutual memories, interlocking thoughts like rings that spread in water.</p>
    <p>De Kalb had said, long ago, that these men were gods. He was right. They were far beyond any concept the men of my day had ever dreamed of for his gods. We walked through their city, were brushed by their thoughts, breathed the air of their streets, but we never saw them.</p>
    <p>They were there. They were all around us. I am perfectly sure of that. I didn't see them. I didn't feel or hear them. But I knew they were there as surely as you know the chair in which you sit now has a back upon which you are leaning, though you won't see it unless you turn.</p>
    <p>I had constantly the odd feeling that if I could turn I might come face to face with any man of the city I chose. But I was not capable of turning in the necessary direction, which would probably have been through a dimension we know nothing of.</p>
    <p>I wish I could have seen them.</p>

     <p>24. BATTLING THE NEKRON</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>The gusts of thought blew thicker and faster around us as we were drawn up the spiral. Our minds linked in impossible chords and discords as impossible ideas struck responses from us all.</p>
    <p>Then the light failed us. Perhaps our sight failed us. I think we were drawn through a rather long space of solid wall, like a locked doorway which only this vortex could open for material things.</p>
    <p>When we could see again we were in a bare and empty room. The shape of it was indescribable because of the extensions along which it reached. I was reminded a little of the corridor down which Belem had guided me toward the Subterrane of the middle future. Geometry, blindingly confused in patterns of inverted planes.</p>
    <p>And then the room around us spoke directly, in the very air that pressed upon our minds. The Face of Ea spoke.</p>
    <p>I had heard that voice before, if voice you could call it The Man-Machine who guarded our age-long slumbers had said, "Sleep -- sleep," in this same voice, growing deeper, calmer, less human as the eons passed. Now it was the voice and the mind of the Man-Machine but immeasurably altered, incomprehensibly more complex.</p>
    <p>"You have seen my first beginning," the Face of Ea said. "You and I have come together to this place at the end of our planet's life. I have watched over your sleep for a purpose. You are my weapons now.</p>
    <p>"The nekron can never be destroyed. But with your help it can be excised out of normal space, normal time. For that I summoned you. For that I guided your journeying in time. Think and you will understand."</p>
    <p>I believe the same knowledge flowed through the minds of my companions in the moment of timeless revelation that came to me. In a series of small, clear pictures I saw the manlike, killing creature that was the nekron, touching me as it swooped through oscillating time, becoming part human by the touch, running rampant through the worlds of humanity.</p>
    <p>"Because of its release and its attacks," the voice of Ea said, "it is part human now. You have learned to fight it. To save yourselves and us you must finish the fight. The nekron cannot be touched -- except by you. But we must somehow excise it out of the universe, not only in space but in time. We must cut back through time, so that we divide and alter the past as well as the present."</p>
    <p>Pictures flashed again through our minds but I at least was able to understand. I saw the worlds of the galaxy turning on their axis and, more cloudily, I saw time turning also, linked to the turning worlds each by its own axis as tangible as the planets themselves to that inner vision. Very dimly I saw something that flashed a little as Belem's severing lights had flashed when the two electronic matrices split in duplicates from the original.</p>
    <p>"I need a wedge, a blade, to split the nekronic infection from normal space and time," the voice went on. "You are my weapons. Do you understand the task before us?</p>
    <p>"Belem learned the way, through the linkage of the knowledge of two eras. Now, on an infinitely larger scale, we must accomplish the same cleaving of two spheres. And each must remain equal in every way to the one original or the balance of the universe will be destroyed.</p>
    <p>"They will differ -- if we prevail -- in one way only. One will be nekronic matter, one will be normal. Never in contact anywhere through all time and space. Do you understand your tasks?</p>
    <p>"You must fight as my weapons against the nekronic universe. Together we must cleave the universe itself in two."</p>
    <p>If you can imagine a sharp tool made sentient, you may guess a little of how what followed seemed to us, who were so integral a part of the tremendous conflict, the ultimate destruction.</p>
    <p>First, the voice died.</p>
    <p>Then there was movement past me and the room seemed to slip into darkness -- or was if I that moved? Those corners of non-Euclidian shape were vortices that swept us apart. We four were the component parts of an exploding nova that shot outward through space, through time. Around me I saw stars, moving very swiftly, and I was alone and there was an inexplicable changing everywhere.</p>
    <p>I knew then that I was moving through time, not a continuous movement but an oscillation, a vibration that swung me back and forth like a pendulum through a period of a few seconds. As the nekronic being moved.</p>
    <p>There was further motion -- not my own -- around me. I could see only the vibrating stars but I knew through senses without name that my companions were not far away now. Paynter was a strong harsh relentless ego within reach of my mind, though all I could see was stars beyond stars, flaring into sight as my vision penetrated farther.</p>
    <p>Belem was De Kalb and De Kalb was Belem, strongly egocentric, brilliant as the stars, a double mind that had shared a single body and learned to work with a single purpose in the dark levels below the conscious will. Topaz was Letta Essen, doubled and doubly armed.</p>
    <p>There was a rushing shadow before me. Swifter and swifter, larger and larger, rushing upon me as I swept forward through the stars. I saw it, and then it was upon me in the same instant. The gap was bridged, the leap made. And I -- I changed in size. I was as large as the shadow.</p>
    <p>I touched it.</p>
    <p>A fiery burning flared out around us and died instantly and the creature flashed into clear outline. Outline only, for it had no features and never did have, only the vague likeness to humanity it had drawn from the minds of its human hosts. Perhaps it was my own will, perhaps the will of the godlike hand that wielded me, that made me close with that solid shadow.</p>
    <p>Where and how I gripped it I do not know. Perhaps I never really touched it at all. Perhaps it was merely will against will. All I could feel now was a furious deadly pressure against which I must exert the utmost of my strength in a direction I could not understand. Mental energy, pure will, perhaps simply the maintenance of temporal reality -- how does the chisel know what force it exerts?</p>
    <p>Somewhere I felt the enemy give back -- not at any point where I met him. He weakened briefly far off in -- space-time? How can I even guess? Perhaps we were hemming him in all around, temporally as well as physically, for some other human tool, De Kalb or Paynter, Letta Essen or Belem -- had cut deeply into the resisting substance that was the nekronic universe.</p>
    <p>The dark was a flashing, coruscating whirl of suns that blazed white. Tracks of fire burned in curves as stars rolled across that white vault. I knew how swiftly I must be moving in time.</p>
    <p>With a jolt I was halted, pressed back. The blind, featureless face of the Adversary loomed larger, blotting out half the white heavens. Back and back I fell --</p>
    <p>And then suddenly there was support all around me, a merging of familiar minds with mine. It was deeper than the nearness I had felt before. We were drawn together, we four. Our minds touched and blended and became a single larger entity, a whole that yet preserved the individuality of us all. The cold clear thoughts of Belem and De Kalb lighted my mind like the facets of brilliance shot from a diamond. The blind white-hot violence of Murray and Paynter, the infinite resource that was Topaz and Letta Essen.</p>
    <p>Now the Adversary shifted its grip. I felt it give a little before our combined pressure. And we seemed to be viewing it from several points at once -- in time. Cross-bearings in time itself. But how?</p>
    <p>I knew the answer very clearly, in one flash.</p>
    <p>We were the chosen weapons, the doubly sharpened blade. That was why my own body and the bodies of the rest had crumbled into dust when the time-axis chamber was shattered. Two identical matrices can not exist in the same space-time, but two identical matrices had been necessary to forge this weapon that was ourselves.</p>
    <p>No mind fixed and conditioned to one sector in time could pin down the nekron. It took a larger concept, a binocular view from two points in time. And the Face of Ea had doubled our striking power when it doubled our minds in bodies that were basically identical with the ones we wore when we were born.</p>
    <p>We had fought this battle before in miniature. In the world of the middle future we had been tempered to this final task. The nekron was fixed and trapped here -- it could no longer evade us through time. Our strangely multiple mind could fix and focus upon it.</p>
    <p>But the battle was yet to come.</p>
    <p>With reckless, single-minded violence that multiple mind smashed out at the nekronic Adversary. As Paynter had driven the metal ram no harder than he drove himself against the fortress barrier, as Harrison Murray had so often hurled himself in stubborn, blind fury against foes tangible and" intangible -- so the weapon that was ourselves crashed against the black nekronic force striving to destroy us.</p>
    <p>Somehow, somewhere, in some hidden weakness of ourselves, it sought and found a flaw. It drove us back. Its own incredible power smashed through warping channels of space and time at our welded minds.</p>
    <p>If a single one of those inconceivable bolts of destruction had struck us it might have been the finish for us all. But none struck. For Topaz was part of the weapon which was ourselves and all Topaz's memories of infinite cleverness, infinitely adaptable life -- with Letta Essen's cool, watchful mind to guide her.</p>
    <p>Oh, Topaz was adaptable -- that had been her purpose and her goal in society. She had incredible mental, emotional, muscular control and she reached instinctively, automatically to any outside threat. Now I saw her talents' ultimate extension as -- somehow, in a black star-blazing gulf that yet embodied the whole universe -- we dodged and whirled and shifted so that none of those nekronic assaults quite smashed home.</p>
    <p>Then, abruptly, we were falling. There was neither up nor down, but a frightful, abysmal vertigo that sucked us with impossible acceleration into the deeps below the universe itself. We were drawn into the black nighted heart of the nekron -- its soul and center -- and life itself receded to a point of infinity and was shut wholly out, away from us. If we had size it must have changed. If we had warmth and life it must have frozen instantly in all minds. In its last defense the nekron itself absorbed us.</p>

     <p>25. RETURN VOYAGE</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Luckily I cannot remember that last horror very clearly.</p>
    <p>It was I who saved us from that.</p>
    <p>This was my purpose. It was the plan from the beginning. That was why I had been allowed from the start to keep my own memories intact. For I was the anchor man at the end of the chain, the solid rock and the lifeline extending beyond the shore of sanity and logic and the monstrous, non-matter maelstrom engulfing the others.</p>
    <p>They had needed their double minds to meet and fight the nekron, to carry the battle to its own grounds. But my purpose was to anchor the line. I could feel them losing touch with all familiar things, feel the dark destroying silence of the nekron closing them in.</p>
    <p>It closed about me too but not completely. It could not shut out my memories. I had a singleness of mind that made a chain too strong to snap. I remembered my own world, my own time, with a clarity unimpaired by double memories. All the small things that are changeless realities came back to me in one strong pouring tide.</p>
    <p>The little things that mean nothing alone -- things like firelight moving on the walls of an old room, the smell of freshly-cut grass at twilight, the sharp fragrance of printer's ink, the heart-shaking thunder of a flight of planes moving in formation overhead, the taste of cold sweet spring-water gushing from a mountainside.</p>
    <p>I remembered Earth.</p>
    <p>So I woke them out of the dead emptiness of the nekron's heart. Their minds clung to mine and mine clung to the lifeline of my own world, my own time, my own indestructible memories.</p>
    <p>Last of all De Kalb struck -- with Belem's mind locked into his.</p>
    <p>We were in the nekron's heart now. We had been admitted to its most vulnerable spot. Once before Belem had done something very like this -- when he joined his mind with mine and summoned the nekronic killer to defeat Paynter's men.</p>
    <p>Now in the nekron's very citadel, its innermost heart -- he gripped our minds closer together. He forced them until they were one indeed.</p>
    <p>He opened that gigantic ultimate mind to the nekron!</p>
    <p>Two of the finest brains of two cultures guided us then -- Belem, inhuman, emotionless, machine-bred, half-human -- and De Kalb, with all his brilliance and his humanity balancing Belem's cold logic. Behind these two-in-one, the rest of us -- a single unit now.</p>
    <p>Paynter and Murray -- hammer and anvil!</p>
    <p>Topaz and Letta Essen -- incomparably resourceful, evading the counter-attack.</p>
    <p>I with my single mind, holding fast to the solidity of the normal universe, standing like a wall behind the others, holding open the gates in that wall through which we had come, through which the power of the Face of Ea poured to help us.</p>
    <p>The power of the nekron flowed through us, channeled by Belem and De Kalb. It emptied, drained like a falling ocean into us. But we were not vulnerable, now. It could not -- feed -- upon us.</p>
    <p>Water, changing to steam, must expand, find room to accommodate its physical change. The process must be completed. But this monstrous change could not be completed in any way normal to the nekron. It had not drained its force into us by choice -- Belem had drawn and channeled it.</p>
    <p>Now its normal release was blocked.</p>
    <p>We were battered back beneath the onslaught of that terribly concentrated power. But we held. Somehow we held -- the multiple minds of two civilizations, chosen and tempered by the last, greatest science of all.</p>
    <p>Then -- it exploded.</p>
    <p>There is no other word. It expanded tremendously, through us and beyond us, and that frightful concentration of alien force was gone. The disincarnated, dissolved units of the nekron expanded -- seeds of the death beyond death -- but helpless in this single moment beyond time, no longer a functioning unit capable of planned action.</p>
    <p>We could never kill it -- but we had it helpless for the first instant in the history of the universe. One moment outside time was all we had -- but one moment was enough.</p>
    <p>The burning suns reeled around us again. They blurred-time blurred and space and the incredible infinite complexity of the universe shuddered and was divided. That was the end.</p>
    <p>The suns flickered out around us. We were sinking into a dimness that swallowed up our senses as the darkness swallowed the light. But I could not quite let go. There was trouble somewhere -- a question unanswered.</p>
    <p>"Have you finished with us now?" I wondered in the darkness. "Are you sending us back, double-minded, into worlds where only a single body can dwell? It was you who destroyed our bodies -- "</p>
    <p>The great calm Face that was the composite of so many faces took shape before my mind's eye, perhaps tangibly before us in the thickening dark. The great, quiet voice said, "If Belem could divide matrices and I universes, do you need to doubt that your bodies can be divided too and each be duplicated exactly from a single matrix? It was done once, in Eden, before the first civilization rose. It shall be done again, by the power of the last civilization of all. Sleep, now -- sleep."</p>
    <p>In the dimness that followed upon the darkening of the suns and the stilling of the voice I remembered Genesis, and Adam's words. Bone of my bones, flesh of my flesh ...</p>
    <p>The Face that watched drew further and further away, grew tinier and tinier in red-lit distances down a vista of diminishing temporal lanes ...</p>
    <p>I knew now that we must have swung far off around that other pole of time, the beginning, the wellspring of life and space and duration. We must have moved forward along the unchanging temporal axis toward our own world.</p>
    <p>In which there was no nekron now, had never been, never would be.</p>
    <p>But there were not even dreams in this slumber to hint at the stations of that journey.</p>
    <p>So we returned,</p>
    <p>So we woke.</p>
    <p>It was Topaz whose eyes met mine when I sat up dizzily after that tremendous nightmare and found the rough walls of the cavern intact around us. Topaz? No -- and yet not Letta Essen either. She smiled and it was Topaz's smile, but the long, long eons had changed her.</p>
    <p>Letta Essen's slumbering ego in the doubled body of the girl Topaz had wrought subtle alterations, pulling back that flexible flesh into a more fitting body for the woman who had been Letta Essen. It was an older and wiser Topaz, a younger Letta Essen, who met my first dazed glance when I awoke.</p>
    <p>Murray was sitting up dizzily. De Kalb had already risen and was trying the flashlight that lay in the entry to our cavern, his face bewildered. I knew why. It seemed incredible that the battery should still be working after such millennia.</p>
    <p>Only no millennia had passed. We had been asleep no time at all as time is counted in this world.</p>
    <p>We hardly spoke. We were still too stunned for clear thinking -- it seemed only a moment ago that we had last looked into the Face of Ea. Unsteadily we made our way out of the cave. The low slanting sunlight of a summer evening still lay across the wooded mountain.</p>
    <p>Instinctively I looked for the white building of the Kerry transmitter that opened upon the farthest worlds of the galaxy -- but that was still a thousand years away. The mountains stretched in unbroken forests to the horizon.</p>
    <p>At the foot of the slope, near the place where Murray's plane still stood awaiting us, was the cabin where De Kalb had lived long ago -- months ago, perhaps, as we count time here but eons had passed just the same -- when this cavern was first dug out of the mountainside.</p>
    <p>De Kalb unlocked the door. The cabin was musty from long disuse but we didn't care. Oddly enough we needed sleep more than anything else in the world. Oddly, because we had just now risen from a sleep of countless millions of years.</p>
    <p>So that's the story.</p>
    <p>And now you know why I can say -- and prove -- that the whole thing never happened. This isn't my world, now. Not any more. Not the world I left. This is a world in which no nekronic flash leaped from a box that Ira De Kalb opened and dropped to his hearthstone to infect the world, De Kalb and me. All that did happen once, in another world that hasn't existed since the four of us, a doubled weapon wielded by the Face of Ea, wrought the cleaving apart of two universes.</p>
    <p>Imponderable forces shifted when that cleavage took place. You and I know nothing about it, for it happened far beyond the perceptions of any sentient creature. But it happened. Oh yes, it happened.</p>
    <p>Funny, how important the little changes are. It's so hard to get used to the absence of so much I used to take for granted. And there are so many new things too, things that weren't there when I went away. Nobody knows that except the four of us, of course. Everybody thinks these things have always been as they are now.</p>
    <p>Well, it's all right as a world -- maybe.</p>
    <p>But not as a world for me. Here I've always been on that roller-coaster, snatching as things rush by. Maybe I'd do the same thing in any world. You never can tell till you try.</p>
    <p>So I'm going to try.</p>
    <p>There are still sleepers in that cavern where the time-axis turns, you know. If De Kalb had looked deeper when he first brought out our images under ultra-violet, he'd have seen more than we ever guessed, at the time. He'd have seen more than our doubled images, still asleep, waiting for the world of the middle future which is the final station in their round-trip through time. Paynter, Belem, Topaz are sleeping there. And so am I. And I mean myself, Jerry Cortland -- twinned.</p>
    <p>You see, I've looked. And I'm there. The other fellow, the one who came up the hill from the Kerry transmitter and blacked out and received my dominant mind, is asleep of course, waiting for his own time. But beside him is -- Jerry Cortland. Two of us. Double images.</p>
    <p>You realize what that means?</p>
    <p>I'm going forward. I know -- because I went. It was a wonderful world they had. I want to see more of it. I want to wake up in a time when the race of man is spreading through the galaxy, leaping across the gulfs between the stars, opening the gates to all the worlds. I want to and I will.</p>
    <p>But I'll never see Topaz again -- unless I'm luckier than I expect to be. I'll never see Belem or Paynter or the world where they'll wake -- finding it changed too, I suppose, and a little bewildering, as mine is now.</p>
    <p>The trouble is, two identical matrices can't exist in the same time. And that other fellow has priority. It's his world, his time. He'll wake with the others and go out. I'll sleep on until the way is clear. That means, of course, until he dies.</p>
    <p>I wish I knew more about him. He had no record in the vast files of the galactic government. He was dressed in ragged clothing when I saw him. That indicates he's some wanderer of the outland planets, living a dangerous life -- if he goes back to it. He may not. Waking with Paynter, Belem, Topaz, he may be drawn into another kind of career entirely. I'll know someday. But not until he's dead. Not until I wake again.</p>
    <p>And when I wake, who knows how many years will have elapsed since Topaz stepped out of the time-axis into her own world again? She may be an old woman before I see her. She may be only a few years matured. She may have been fifty years dead. Perhaps I may never be sure. You see, I don't even know her name.</p>
    <p>She was Topaz that week in which I wakened. Next week, and the week after and the year beyond that -- do you think any records are kept of the whims of a girl like Topaz? Not even she will remember by the time I wake, if she's alive then. Time moves too fast for that.</p>
    <p>Well, all this belongs to the future. And so do I. Even before the cosmic cleavage altered all history I was a misfit in this civilization. And now it just isn't my world anymore. I don't belong here. So I think I'll take my chances in that other place, where I won't have to get used to the little things that keep bothering me here and bother nobody but me --</p>
    <p>Like Washington being the capital of the United States -- now!</p>

    <p>THE CREATURE FROM BEYOND INFINITY</p>

   <section>
    <title>
     <p>CHAPTER I.</p>
     <p>The Beginning</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Ardath opened his eyes, trying to remember why a blinding pain should be throbbing within his skull. Above him was a twisted girder of yellow metal, and beyond that, the inner wall of the space ship. What had happened?</p>
    <p>It seemed scarcely a moment ago that the craft had been filled with a confusion of shouted orders, quickly moving men, and the shriek of cleft atmosphere as the ship drove down. Then had come the shock of landing--blackness. And now?</p>
    <p>Painfully Ardath dragged his slight, fragile body erect. All around him were ruin and confusion. Corpses lay sprawled and limp, the bodies of those who had not survived the terrible concussion. Strange men, slim and delicate, their skins had been darkly tanned by the long voyage across space. Ardath started hopefully when he saw that one of the bodies moved slightly and moaned.</p>
    <p>Theron! Theron, the commander--highest in rank and wisdom--had survived. A wave of gratefulness swept through Ardath. He was not alone on this new, unknown world, as he had feared. Swiftly he found stimulants and bent over the reviving man.</p>
    <p>Theron's gray, beardless face grew contorted. His pallid blue eyes opened. He drew a lean hand over his bald head as he whispered.</p>
    <p>"Ardath--"</p>
    <p>A rocking shudder shook the ship, then suddenly died.</p>
    <p>"Who else is alive?" Theron asked with painful effort.</p>
    <p>"I don't know, Theron," Ardath replied softly.</p>
    <p>"Find out."</p>
    <p>Ardath searched the huge golden ship. He came back with despair on his drawn harrowed features.</p>
    <p>"You and I are the only ones left alive, Theron."</p>
    <p>The commander gnawed at his lips.</p>
    <p>"So. And I am dying." He smiled resignedly at Ardath's sudden protest. "It's true, Ardath. You do not realize how old I am. For years we have gone through space, and you are the youngest of us. Unshield a port. Let me see where we are."</p>
    <p>"The third planet of this System," Ardath said.</p>
    <p>He pressed a button that swung back a shutter from a nearby port in the golden wall. They saw nothing but darkness at first. Then their eyes became accustomed to the gloom.</p>
    <p>The ship lay beached on a dim shore. Blackly ominous the strange world loomed through the gray murk of vague light that filtered through the cloudy sky. A slow drizzle of rain was falling.</p>
    <p>"Test the atmosphere," Theron commanded. Ardath obeyed. Spectroscopic analysis, made from outer space, had indicated that the air here was breathable. The chemical test confirmed this. At Theron's request, Ardath opened a spacelock.</p>
    <p>Air surged in with a queerly choking sulphurous odor. The two men coughed rackingly, until eventually they became accustomed to it.</p>
    <p>"Carry me out," the commander said quietly. His glance met and locked with Ardath's as the younger man hesitated. "I shall die soon," he insisted gently. "But first I must--I must know that I have reached my goal."</p>
    <p>Silently Ardath lifted the slight figure in his arms. He splashed through the warm waves and gently laid Theron down on the barren beach. The Sun, hidden behind a cloud blanket, was rising in the first dawn Ardath had ever seen.</p>
    <p>A gray sky and sea, a dark shore--those were all he actually saw. Under Ardath's feet he felt the world shudder with the volcanic fires of creation. Rain and tide had not yet eroded the rocks into sand and soil. No vegetation grew anywhere. He did not know whether the land was an island or a continent. It rose abruptly from the beach and mounted to towering crags against the inland skyline.</p>
    <p>Theron sighed. His thin ringers groped blindly over the rocky surface on which he lay.</p>
    <p>"You are space-born, Ardath," he said painfully. "You cannot quite realize that only on a planet can a man find a home. But I am afraid. ..."</p>
    <p>His voice died away. Then it rose again, strengthened. "I am dying but there is something I must tell you first. Listen, Ardath . . . You never knew your mother planet, Kyria. It is light-years away from this world. Or it was. Centuries ago, we discovered that Kyria was doomed. A wandering planetoid came so close that it would inevitably collide with us and destroy our civilization utterly. "Kyria was a lovely world, Ardath."</p>
    <p>"I know," Ardath breathed. "I have seen the films in our records."</p>
    <p>"You have seen our great cities, and the green forests and fields--" An agonizing cough rocked the dying commander. He went on hastily. "We fled. A selected group of us made this space ship and left Kyria in search of a new home. But of hundreds of planets that we found, none was suitable. None would sustain human life. This, the third planet of this yellow Sun, is our last hope. Our fuel is almost gone. It is your duty, Ardath, to see that the civilization of Kyria does not perish."</p>
    <p>"But this is a dead world," the younger man protested.</p>
    <p>"It is a young world," Theron corrected.</p>
    <p>He paused, and his hand lifted, pointing. Ardath stared at the slow, sullen tide that rippled drearily toward them. The gloomy wash of water receded. And there on the rocky slope lay something that made him nod understandingly.</p>
    <p>It was not large. A greasy, shining blob of slime, featureless and repulsive, it was unmistakably alive, undeniably sentient!</p>
    <p>The shimmering globule of protoplasm was drawn back with the next wave. When Ardath's eyes met Theron's, the dying man smiled triumphantly.</p>
    <p>"Life! There's sun here, Ardath, beyond the clouds--a Sun that sends forth energy, cosmic rays, the rays of evolution. Immeasurable ages will pass before human beings exist here, but exist they will! Our study of countless other planets enables us to predict the course of evolution here. From the unicellular creatures will come sea-beings with vertebrae, then amphibiae, and true reptiles.</p>
    <p>"Then warm-blooded beasts will evolve from the flying reptiles and the dinosaurs. Finally there will be ape-like men, who will yield the planet to--true men!"</p>
    <p>"But it will take millennia!"</p>
    <p>"You must remain here," Theron stated. "How many of us survived the voyage from Kyria? You must wait, Ardath, even a million years if it is necessary. Our stasis ray kept us in suspended animation while we came across space. Take the ship beyond the atmosphere. Adjust it to a regular orbit, like a second satellite around this world.</p>
    <p>"Set the controls so you will awaken eventually, and be able to investigate the evolutionary progress of this planet. You will wait a long time, I admit. But finally you will find men."</p>
    <p>"Men like us?"</p>
    <p>Theron shook his head regretfully.</p>
    <p>"No. Super-mentality is a matter of eugenically controlled breeding. Occasionally a mental giant will be born, but not often. On Kyria we bred and mated these mental giants, till eventually their progeny peopled the planet. You must do the same with this world."</p>
    <p>"I will," Ardath consented. "But how--" "Go through the ages. Do not stop till you find one of these mental giants. He will be easily recognized, for, almost from infancy, he will be far in advance of his contemporaries. He will withdraw from them, turning to the pursuit of wisdom. He will be responsible for many of the great inventions of his time. Take this man--or woman, perhaps--and go on into time, until you have found a mental giant of the opposite sex. "You could never mate with a female of this world, Ardath. Since you are from another system, it would be biologically impossible. The union would be sterile. This is your duty--find a super-mentality, take him from his own time-sector, and find a mate for him in the more distant future. From that union will arise a race of giants equal to the Kyrians. In a sense, you will have been their foster-father."</p>
    <p>Theron sighed and turned his head till his cheek lay against the bare rock of the shore.</p>
    <p>"May the great Architect guide you, Ardath," he said softly.</p>
    <p>Abruptly his head slumped, and Theron was dead. The gray waves whispered a requiem. Ardath stood silent, looking down at the worn, tired face, now relaxed in death. He was alone, infinitely far from the nearest human being. Then another feeling came, making him realize that he was no longer a homeless wanderer of space.</p>
    <p>Never in his life had Ardath stood on a world's surface. The others had told him of Kyria, and on the pictorial library screens he had seen views of green and sunset lands that were agonizingly beautiful. Inevitably Ardath had come to fear the black immensity of the starlit void, to hate its cold, eternal changelessness. He had dreamed of walking on grassy, rolling plains. ...</p>
    <p>That would come, for he knew Theron had been right. Cycads and ferns would grow where Ardath now stood. Amphibiae would come out of the waters and evolve, slowly of course, but with inexorable certainty. He could afford to wait.</p>
    <p>First, though, he needed power. The great atomic engine of the ship was useless, exhausted.</p>
    <p>Atomic power resembled dynamite in that it needed some outside source of energy to get it started. Dynamite required a percussion cap. The engine of the golden ship needed power. Solar energy? Lenses were required. Besides, the cloudblanket was an insurmountable handicap, filtering out most of the necessary rays. Coal? It would not exist here for ages.</p>
    <p>A tremble shook the ground, and Ardath nodded thoughtfully. There was power below the power of seething lava, enormous pressures, and heat that could melt solid rock. Could it be harnessed?</p>
    <p>Steam ... a geyser! That would provide the necessary energy to start the atomic motor. After that, anything would be possible.</p>
    <p>With a single regretful glance at the dead Theron, Ardath set out to explore the savage new world.</p>
    <p>For two days and nights he hunted, growing haggard and weary. At last he found an area of lava streams, shuddering rock, and geysers. Steam feathered up into the humid air, and to the north a red glow brightened the gray sky.</p>
    <p>Ardath stood for a while, watching. His quest was ended. Long weeks of arduous work still lay ahead, but now he had no doubt of ultimate success. The steam demons would set the atomic motor into the operation. After that, he could rip ores from the ground and find chemicals. But after that?</p>
    <p>The ship must be made spaceworthy again, though not for another long voyage. Such a course would be fruitless. Of all the planets the Kyrians had visited, only this world was capable of supporting life.</p>
    <p>As yet, mere cells of blind, insensate protoplasm swarmed in the sullen seas, but those cells would develop. Evolution would work upon them. Perhaps in a million years human beings, intelligent creatures, would walk this world. Then, one day, a super-mentality would be born, and Ardath would find that kindred mind. He would take that mental giant into the future, in search of a suitable mate. After dozens of generations there would arise a civilization that would rival that of Kyria--his home planet now utterly destroyed without trace.</p>
    <p>Time passed as Ardath worked. He blasted out a grave for Theron on the shore where the old Kyrian had died. He repaired the golden craft. Tirelessly he toiled.</p>
    <p>Five months later, the repaired space ship rose, carrying its single passenger. Through the atmosphere it fled. It settled into an orbit, became a second, infinitesimal moon revolving around the mother planet.</p>
    <p>Within it Ardath's robot machinery began to operate. A ray beamed out, touching and bathing the man's form, which was stretched on a low couch.</p>
    <p>Slowly consciousness left Ardath. The atomic structure of his body was subtly altered. Electrons slowed in their orbits. Since they emitted no quanta, Ardath's energy was frozen in the utter motionlessness of stasis. Neither alive nor dead, he slept.</p>
    <p>The ray clicked off. When Ardath wakened, he would see a different world older and stranger. Perhaps it would even be peopled by intelligent beings.</p>
    <p>Silently the space ship swept on. Far beneath it a planet; shuddered in the titanic grip of dying fires. The rains poured down, eroding, endless. The tides flowed and ebbed. Always the cloud veil shrouded the world that was to be called Earth. Amid the shattering thunder of deluges, new lands rose and continents were formed.</p>
    <p>Life, blind, hungry and groping, crawled up on the beaches, where it basked for a time in the dim sunlight.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER II.</p>
     <p>Youth</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>On August 7, 1924, an eight-year-old boy caused a panic in a Des Moines theater.</p>
    <p>His name was Stephen Court He had been born to a theatrical family of mediocre talent--the Crazy Courts, they were billed. The act was a combination of gags, dances and humorous songs. Stephen traveled with his parents on tour, when they played one-night stands and small vaudeville circuits. In 1924, vaudeville had not yet been killed by the films. It was the beginning of the Jazz Age.</p>
    <p>Stephen was so remarkably intelligent, even as a child, that he was soon incorporated into the act as a "mental wizard." He wore a miniature cap and gown, and was introduced by his parents at the end of their turn.</p>
    <p>"Any date--ask him any historical date, my friends, and he will answer! The gentleman in the third row. What do you want to know?"</p>
    <p>And Stephen would answer accurately. When did Columbus discover America? When was the Magna Charta signed? When was the Battle of Hastings? When was Lafayette born?</p>
    <p>"Mathematical questions? You, there--"</p>
    <p>Stephen would answer. Mathematics was no riddle for him, nor algebra. The value of pi? He knew it. Formulas and equations slipped glibly from his tongue. He stood on the stage in the spotlight, his small face impassive, a small, dark-haired child with curiously luminous brown eyes, and answered all questions.</p>
    <p>He read omnivorously every book he could manage to obtain. He was coldly unemotional, which distressed his mother, and he hid his thoughts well.</p>
    <p>Then, on that August night, his Me suddenly changed.</p>
    <p>The act was almost over. The audience was applauding wildly. The Courts stood on each side of the boy, bowing. And Stephen stood motionless, his strange, glowing eyes staring out into the gloom of the theater.</p>
    <p>"Take your bows, kid," Court hissed from the side of his mouth.</p>
    <p>But the boy didn't answer. There was an odd tensity in his rigid posture. His expressionless face seemed strained. Only in his eyes was there life, and a terrible fire.</p>
    <p>In the theater, a whisper grew to a murmur and the applause died. Then the murmur swelled to a restrained roar, until someone screamed:</p>
    <p>"Fire!"</p>
    <p>Court glanced around quickly. He could see no signs of smoke or flame. But he made a quick gesture, and the orchestra leader struck up a tune. Hastily the man and woman went into a routine tap dance.</p>
    <p>"Steve!" Court said urgently. "Join in!"</p>
    <p>But Stephen just stood there, and through the theater the roar rose to individual screams of panic. The audience no longer watched the stage. They sprang up and fought then-way to the exits, cursing, pushing, crowding.</p>
    <p>Nothing could stop it. By sheer luck no one was killed. But in ten minutes the theater was empty--and there had been no sign of a fire.</p>
    <p>In his dressing room, Court looked queerly at his son.</p>
    <p>"What was wrong with you tonight, kid?" he asked, as he removed greasepaint from his face with cold cream.</p>
    <p>"Nothing," Stephen said abstractedly.</p>
    <p>"Something funny about the whole thing. There wasn't any fire."</p>
    <p>Stephen sat on a chair, his legs swinging idly.</p>
    <p>"That magician we played with last week--" he began.</p>
    <p>"Yeah?"</p>
    <p>"I got some ideas from him."</p>
    <p>"Well?" his father urged.</p>
    <p>"I watched him when he hypnotized a man from the audience. That's all it was. I hypnotized the entire audience tonight."</p>
    <p>"Oh, cut it out," Court said, grinning.</p>
    <p>"It's true! The conditions were right. Everyone's attention was focused on me. I made them think there was a fire."</p>
    <p>When Court turned and looked at the boy, he had an odd feeling that this was not his son sitting opposite him. The round face was childish, but the eyes were not. They were cold, watchful, direct.</p>
    <p>Court laughed without much conviction.</p>
    <p>"You're crazy," he said, turning back to the light-rimmed mirror.</p>
    <p>"Maybe I am," Stephen said lightly. "I want to go to school. Will you send me?"</p>
    <p>"I can't afford it Anyway, you're too big an attraction. Maybe we can manage later."</p>
    <p>Stephen did not argue. He rose and went toward his mother's dressing room, but he did not enter. Instead, he turned and left the theater.</p>
    <p>He had determined to run away.</p>
    <p>Stephen already knew that his brain was far superior to the average. It was as yet unformed, requiring knowledge and capable training. Those he could never get through his parents. He felt no sorrow or pity on leaving them. His cool intellect combined with the natural cruelty of childhood to make him unemotional, passionlessly logical.</p>
    <p>But Stephen needed money, and his youth was a handicap. No one would employ a child, he knew, except perhaps as a newsboy. Moreover, he had to outwit his parents, who would certainly search for their son.</p>
    <p>Strangely there was nothing pathetic about Stephen's small figure as he trudged along the dark street. His iron singleness of purpose and his ruthless will gave him a certain incongruous dignity. He walked swiftly to the railroad station.</p>
    <p>On the way he passed a speakeasy. A man was lying in the gutter before the door, an unshaved derelict, grizzled of hair and with worn, dissolute features. He was mumbling drunkenly and striving helplessly to rise.</p>
    <p>Stephen paused to watch. Attracted by the silent gaze, the man looked up. As the two glances met, inflexible purpose grew in the boy's pale face.</p>
    <p>"Wanna--drink," the derelict mumbled. "Gotta--they won't give old Sammy a drink. . . ."</p>
    <p>Stephen's eyes again grew luminous. They seemed to bore into the watery eyes of the hobo, probing, commanding.</p>
    <p>"Eh?" the drunkard asked blankly.</p>
    <p>Sammy's voice died off uncertainly as he staggered erect. Stephen gripped his arm, and the two went down the street. In a dark doorway they paused.</p>
    <p>The foggy, half-wrecked brain of the tramp was no match for Stephen's hypnotic powers. Sammy listened as the boy talked.</p>
    <p>"You're catching a freight out of town. You're taking me with you. Do you understand?"</p>
    <p>"Eh?" Sammy asked vaguely.</p>
    <p>In a monotonous voice the boy repeated his commands. When the drunkard finally understood, the two headed for the railway station.</p>
    <p>Stephen's plans were made. To all appearance, he was a mere child. He could not possibly have fulfilled his desires alone. The authorities would have returned him to his parents, or he would have been sent to a school as a public charge. What man could recognize in a young boy an already blossoming genius? Stephen's super-mentality was seriously handicapped by his immaturity.</p>
    <p>He needed a guardian, purely nominal, to satisfy the prejudices of the world. Through Sammy he could act. Sammy would be his tongue, his hands, his legal representative. Men would be willing to deal with Sammy, where they would nave laughed at a child. But first the tramp would have to be metamorphosed into a "useful citizen."</p>
    <p>That night they rode in a chilly boxcar, headed East. Hour after hour Stephen worked on the brain of his captive. Sammy must be his eyes, his hands, his provider.</p>
    <p>Once Sammy had been a mechanic, he revealed under Stephen's relentless probing. The train rolled on through the darkness, the wheels beating a clicking threnody toward the East.</p>
    <p>It was not easy, for the habits of years had weakened Sammy's body and mind. He was a convinced tramp, lazy and content to follow his wanderlust. But always Stephen drove him on, arguing, commanding, convincing. Hypnosis played a large part in the boy's ultimate success.</p>
    <p>Sammy got a job, much against his will, and washed dishes in a cheap restaurant for a few weeks. He shaved daily and consistently drank less. Meanwhile Stephen waited, but he did not wait in idleness. He spent his days visiting automobile agencies and studying the machines. At night he crouched in a cheap tenement room, sketching and designing. Finally he spoke to Sammy.</p>
    <p>"I want you to get another job. You will be a mechanic in an automobile factory." He watched Sammy's reaction.</p>
    <p>"Aw, I can't, Steve," the man protested. "They wouldn't even look at me. Let's hit the road again, huh?"</p>
    <p>"Show them these," Stephen ordered, extending a sheaf of closely written papers and drawings. "They'll give you a job."</p>
    <p>At first the foreman told Sammy to get out, after a glance at his red-rimmed eyes and weak, worn face. But the papers were a magic password. The foreman pondered over them, bewilderedly scrutinized Sammy, and went off to confer with one of the managers.</p>
    <p>"The man's good!" he blurted. "He doesn't look it, but he's an expert mechanic, just the kind of man we need. Look at these improvements he's worked out! This wiring change will save us thousands annually. And this gear ratio. It's new, but it might work. I think--"</p>
    <p>"Send him in," the manager said hastily.</p>
    <p>Thus Sammy got his job. Actually he wasn't much good, but every month or two he would show up with some new improvement, some unexpected invention, that got him raises instead of dismissal. Of course Stephen was responsible for all this. He had adopted Sammy.</p>
    <p>Stephen saw to it that they moved to a more convenient apartment, and now he went to school. Needing surprisingly little sleep, he spent most of his time studying. There was so much to learn, and so little time! To acquire the knowledge he wanted, he needed more and more money to pay for tutoring and equipment.</p>
    <p>The years passed with a peaceful lack of haste. Sammy drank little now, and took a great deal of interest in his work. But he was still a tramp at heart, eternally longing for the open road. Sometimes he would try to slip away, but Stephen was always too watchful.</p>
    <p>At last the boy was ready for the next step. It was then early in 1927. After months of arduous toil, he had completed several inventions which he thought valuable. He had Sammy patent them, and then market them to the highest bidders.</p>
    <p>The result was more money than Stephen had expected. He made Sammy resign his job, and the two of them retired to a country house. He brought along several tutors, and had a compact, modern laboratory set up. When more money was required, the boy would potter around for a while. Inevitably he emerged with a new formula that increased the already large annual income.</p>
    <p>Tutors changed as Stephen grew older and learned more. He attended college for a year, but found he could apply his mind better at home. He needed a larger headquarters, though. So they moved to Wisconsin and bought a huge old mansion, which he had renovated.</p>
    <p>His quest for knowledge seemed endless, yet he did not neglect his health. He went for long walks and exercised mightily. When he grew to manhood, he was a magnificent specimen, strong, well formed and handsome. But always, save for a few occasional lapses, he was coldly unemotional.</p>
    <p>Once he had detectives locate his parents, and anonymously arranged to provide a large annual income for them. But he would not see either his father or mother.</p>
    <p>"They would mean emotional crises," he told Sammy. "There would be unnecessary arguments. By this time they have forgotten me, anyway."</p>
    <p>"Think so?" Sammy muttered, chewing on the stem of his ancient pipe. His nut-brown, wrinkled face looked rather puzzled under his stiff crop of white hair. "Well, I never did think you was human, Stevie."</p>
    <p>He shook his head, put the pipe away, and pottered off in search of his rare drinks. Stephen returned to his work.</p>
    <p>What was the purpose of these years of intensive study? He scarcely knew. His mind was a vessel to be filled with the clear, exhilarating liquor of knowledge. As Sammy's system craved alcohol, so Stephen's brain thirsted for wisdom. Study and experiment were to him a delight that approached actual ecstasy. As an athlete gets keen pleasure from the exercise of his well trained body, so Stephen exulted in the exercise of his mind.</p>
    <p>Unimaginable eons before, in the teeming seas of a primeval world, life-forms had fed their blind hunger. That was appetite of the flesh.</p>
    <p>Stephen's hunger was the appetite of the mind. But it also made him blind, in a different way. He was a godlike man, and he was--unhuman.</p>
    <p>By 1941 he was the greatest scientist in the world.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER III.</p>
     <p>The Earth-born</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Before man created gods, Ardath was. In his space ship, swinging silently around the world, he slept as the ages went past . . .</p>
    <p>Sometimes he woke and searched, always in vain, for intelligent life in the land below. The road of evolution was long and bloody.</p>
    <p>Dark weariness shrouded Ardath as he saw the vast, mindless, terrible behemoths of the oceans. Monsters wallowed into the swamps. The ground shook beneath the tread of tyrant lizards. Brontosaurs and pterodactyls lived and fed and died.</p>
    <p>There were mammals--oehippus the fleet and three-toed, and a tiny marsupial in which the flame of intelligence glowed feebly. But the titan reptiles ruled. Mammals could not survive in this savage, thundering world.</p>
    <p>Forests of weeds and bamboo towered in a tropical zone that stretched almost to the poles. Ardath pondered, studied for a time in his laboratory--and the Ice Age came.</p>
    <p>Was Ardath responsible? Perhaps. His science was not Earthly, and his powers were unimaginable. The ice mountains swept down, blowing their frigid breath upon the forests and the reptile giants.</p>
    <p>Southward the hegira fled. It was the Day of Judgment for the idiot colossi that had ruled too long.</p>
    <p>But the mammals survived. Shuddering in the narrow equatorial belt, they starved and whimpered. But they lived, and they evolved, while Ardath slept again. . . .</p>
    <p>When he awoke, he found beast-men, hairy and ferocious. They dwelt in gregarious packs, ruled by an Old Man who had proved himself strongest of the band.</p>
    <p>But always the chill winds of the icelands tore at them as they crouched in their caves.</p>
    <p>Ardath found one, wiser than the rest, and taught him the use of fire. Then the alien man sent his ship arrowing up from Earth, while flames began to burn wanly before cave-mouths. In grunts and sign language the story was told. Ages later, man would tell the tale of Prometheus, who stole fire from the very gods of heaven.</p>
    <p>Folk-lore is filled with the legends of men who visited the gods--the Little People or the Sky-dwellers--and returned with strange powers. Arrows and spears, the smelting of ores, the sowing and reaping of grain. . . . How many inventions could be traced to Ardath?</p>
    <p>But at last Ardath slept for a longer time than ever before, and then he awoke.</p>
    <p>Dark was the city. Flambeaux were numerous as fireflies in the gloomy streets. The metropolis lay like a crouching beast on the shore, a vast conglomeration of stone, crude and colossal.</p>
    <p>The ship of Ardath hung far above the city, unseen in the darkness of the night. Ardath himself was busy in his laboratory, working on a curiously constructed device that measured the frequency and strength of mentality. Thought created electrical energy, and Ardath's machine registered the power of that energy. Delicately he sent an invisible narrow-wave beam down into the city far beneath.</p>
    <p>On a gauge a needle crept up, halted, dipped, and mounted again. Ardath reset a dial. Intelligent beings dwelt on Earth now, but their intelligence was far inferior to Ardath's. He was searching for a higher level.</p>
    <p>The needle was inactive as Ardath swept the city with his ray. Useless! The pointer did not even quiver. The mental giant Ardath sought was not here, though this was the greatest metropolis of the primeval world.</p>
    <p>But suddenly the needle jerked slightly. Ardath halted the ray and turned to a television screen. Using the beam as a carrier, he focused upon a scene that sprang into instant visibility.</p>
    <p>He saw a throne of black stone upon which a woman sat. Tall and majestic, an Amazon of forty or more, she had lean, rugged features, and wore plain garments of leather.</p>
    <p>Guards flanked her, gigantic, stolid, armed with spears. Before the throne a man stood, and it was at this man that Ardath stared.</p>
    <p>For months the Kyrian's ship had scoured the skies, searching jungles and deserts. Few cities existed. On the northern steppes, shaggy beast-men still dwelt in caves, fighting the mammoth. But the half-men and the hairy elephants were rapidly degenerating. In mountain lakes were villages built on stilts and piers sunken into the mud, but these clans were barbarous. Only on this island were there civilization and intelligence, though lamentably lower than Ardath's own level.</p>
    <p>The man from space watched the wisest human on this primitive Earth.</p>
    <p>In chains the Earthman stood before the black stone. He was huge, massively thewed, with a bronzed, hairy skin showing through the rags he wore. His face resembled that of a beast, ferocious with hatred. Amber cat's-eyes glared from beneath the beetling brows. The jutting jaw was hidden by a wiry beard that tangled around the nose that was little more than a snout.</p>
    <p>Yet in that brute body, Ardath knew, dwelt amazing intelligence. Shrewdness and cunning were well masked by the hideous face and form.</p>
    <p>What of the queen? Curious to know, Ardath tested her with his ray. She, too, was more intelligent than most of the savages.</p>
    <p>"These two are enemies," Ardath thought. "And I imagine that the man faces danger or death. Well, what is that to me? I cannot live in a time where all are barbarians. It is best that I sleep again."</p>
    <p>Yet he hesitated, one hand resting lightly on the controls that would send the ship racing up into space. The barren loneliness of the void, the slow centuries of his dark vigil, crept with icy tentacles into his mind. He thought of the equally long, miserably lonely future.</p>
    <p>"Suppose I sleep again and wake in a dead world? It could happen, for my own home planet was destroyed. How could I face another search through space? Theron and the rest had each other. . . ."</p>
    <p>He turned back again to watch the two people on the screen.</p>
    <p>"They are intelligent, after a fashion, and they would be companions. If I took them with me, and we woke in a lifeless time, they could bring forth a new race which I could train eugenically into the right pattern."</p>
    <p>The decision was made. Ardath would sleep again in his ship--but this time not alone.</p>
    <p>He glanced at the screen, and his eyes widened. A new factor had entered the problem. Hastily he turned to a complicated machine at his side. . . .</p>
    <p>As Thordred the Usurper stood before the throne of his queen, his savage face was immobile. Weaponless, fettered, he nevertheless glared with implacable fury at the woman who had spoiled his plans.</p>
    <p>Zana met his gaze coldly. Her harsh features were darkly somber.</p>
    <p>"Well?" she asked. "Have you anything to say to me?"</p>
    <p>"Nothing," Thordred grunted. "I have failed. That is all."</p>
    <p>The huge, almost empty throne room echoed his words eerily.</p>
    <p>"Aye, you have failed," the queen said. "And there is but one fate for losers who revolt. You tried to force me from my throne, and instead you stand in chains before me. You have lost, so you must die."</p>
    <p>Thordred's grin mocked her calm decision.</p>
    <p>"And a woman continues to rule our land. Never in history has this shame been put upon us. Always we have been ruled by men--warriors!"</p>
    <p>"You call me weakling!" Zana snarled at him. "By all the gods, you are rash, Thordred. You know well that I've never shirked battle, and that my sword has been swift to slay. I am strong as a man and more cunning than you."</p>
    <p>"Yet you are a woman," Thordred taunted recklessly. "Kill me, if you wish, but you cannot deny your sex."</p>
    <p>A shadow darkened Zana's face as she glared venomously at her mocker.</p>
    <p>"Aye, I shall kill you," she said. "So slowly that you will beg for a merciful death. Then the vultures will pick your carcass clean on the Mountain of the Gods."</p>
    <p>Thordred suddenly shouted with laughter.</p>
    <p>"Save your words, wench. It is just like a woman to threaten with words. A man's vengeance is with a spear, swift and sudden."</p>
    <p>He paused, and a curious light grew in his amber eyes. His great body tensed as Thordred listened.</p>
    <p>In the distance, a tumult grew louder and louder, like the beating of the sea. Suddenly it was thundering through the throne room.</p>
    <p>Zana sprang to her feet, her lips parted in astonishment.</p>
    <p>The vast doors at the end of the room burst inward. Through the portal poured a yelling mob.</p>
    <p>"Thordred!" they roared. "Ho, Thordred!"</p>
    <p>The giant grinned victoriously at Zana.</p>
    <p>"Some are still faithful to me, it seems. They would rather see a man on the throne--"</p>
    <p>A blistering curse burst from Zana's lips. She snatched a spear from a guard and savagely drove its point at the prisoner. But Thordred sprang aside, laughing, the muscles rolling effortlessly under his tawny skin.</p>
    <p>He set his foot on the links of the chain that bound his wrists. His body arched like a bow. The metal snapped asunder, and Thordred the Usurper was free!</p>
    <p>The guards near the throne leaped at him. He ducked under a swift spear at the same instant that his fist smashed a face into a bloody ruin. And then the mob surrounded him, lifted him, bore him back.</p>
    <p>"Slay him!" Zana shrilled. "Slay him!"</p>
    <p>The mob swept back, out of the hall, through the great doors and into the street.</p>
    <p>But now Zana's cried brought a response. Armed soldiers rushed in through a dozen portals. They raced after the escaping prisoner, with Zana fearlessly leading them.</p>
    <p>It was sunset. The western sky flamed blood-red. Down the street the crowd seethed, to halt in an open plaza. Grimly menacing, they turned at bay, Thordred at their head. He towered above the others with his chains dangling from his wrists and ankles.</p>
    <p>Zana's men formed into a sizeable army, filling the street from side to side.</p>
    <p>Arrows flew, hissing at the angry, triumphant mob. Over the city the low, thunderous muttering grew louder.</p>
    <p>"Revolt! Revolt!"</p>
    <p>It was civil war.</p>
    <p>But the conflict was not yet in contact. A space still lay between the two forces. Only spears and arrows had crossed it.</p>
    <p>"Charge!" Zana shouted. "Slay them all!"</p>
    <p>Grinning, Thordred raised high his lance and shook it defiantly.</p>
    <p>The queen's soldiers drew erect, and like a thundercloud they began to move. Abruptly they were sweeping forward, irresistible, a tidal wave bristling with steel barbs. The pounding of then- shod feet hammered loud on the stones. In the forefront raced Zana, her harsh face twisted with fury.</p>
    <p>Thordred let fly his spear. It missed its mark. At the last moment the giant had hesitated, and his gaze went up to the western sky. His jaw dropped in awe. For the first time, Thordred was afraid. A scream rose, thin and wailing.</p>
    <p>"Demons!" someone cried. "Demons!"</p>
    <p>The soldiers slowed involuntarily in their charge, then one by one they halted. Struck motionless with fearful wonder, every man stood gaping toward the west.</p>
    <p>Against the blood-red sunset loomed actual demons!</p>
    <p>Giants, scores of feet tall, they were. Titans whose heads towered above the city's walls. A whole army of the monsters loomed black against the scarlet sky. These were not men! Shaggy, hump-shouldered, dreadful beings more human than apes but unmistakably beasts, they came thundering down upon the city. The frightful masks twisted in ferocious hunger. They swept forward--</p>
    <p>No one noticed that their advance made not the slightest sound. Panic struck the mobs. Both sides dropped then-weapons to flee.</p>
    <p>From the sky a great, shining globe dropped. It hovered above the plaza. Two beams of light flashed down from it. One struck Thordred, bathing him in crawling radiance. The other caught Zana.</p>
    <p>The man and the woman alike were held motionless. Frozen, paralyzed, they were swept up, lifted into the air. When they reached the huge globe, they seemed to disappear.</p>
    <p>The sphere then rose, dwindled quickly to a speck and was gone.</p>
    <p>Surprisingly the giants had also vanished.</p>
    <p>Ardath adjusted the controls. Sighing, he turned away. The ship was back in its orbit, circling the Earth. It would not deviate from that course for centuries, until the moment Ardath's hand moved its controls.</p>
    <p>He picked up a small metal box, stepped out of the laboratory and closed the panel. On the floor at his feet lay the unconscious forms of Zana and Thordred. Ardath set down the box.</p>
    <p>This would be a new experiment, one that he had never tried. He could not speak the language of these Earthlings, nor could they speak his. But knowledge could be transmitted from one brain to another. Thought patterns were a form of energy, and that could be transferred, just as a matrix may stamp out duplicates. First, the man. . . .</p>
    <p>Ardath opened the black box, took out a circular metallic band and adjusted it about the sleeping Thordred's head. A similar band went about his own. He pressed a switch, felt a stinging, tingling sensation within his skull.</p>
    <p>He removed the metal bands, replaced them and waited patiently. Would the experiment work? His lips shaped unfamiliar syllables. He had learned Thordred's language--but could the undeveloped brain of the Earthling be equally receptive?</p>
    <p>Thordred groaned and opened his eyes. He stared up at Ardath. Into those amber eyes came a curious look that might have been amazement, but which was certainly not fear.</p>
    <p>"You are not hurt," Ardath said in Thordred's harsh, primitive language. "Nor will you be harmed."</p>
    <p>The Earthling stood up with an effort, breathing hoarsely. He took an unsteady step, reeled, collapsed with a shattering crash upon the thought transference apparatus. He lay silent and unmoving, an utterly helpless strong man.</p>
    <p>No expression showed on Ardath's face, though the work of weeks had been ruined. The device could be built again, though he did not know if it should be. Had it been successful?</p>
    <p>Thordred shuddered, rolled over. Painfully he rose and leaned weakly against the wall. His amber eyes rested puzzledly on Ardath as he asked a question in the Kyrian's soft language, which grated from his crude throat.</p>
    <p>"Who are you, a god or a demon?"</p>
    <p>Ardath smiled with satisfaction, for all was going well. He must explain matters to this Earthling to calm his fears. Later, he would rebuild the machine and teach Zana his own tongue. Then the three could sleep, for centuries if necessary.</p>
    <p>But Ardath did not know that his device had worked too well. It had transferred knowledge of his own language to Thordred's brain, yet it had transferred more than that. All of Ardath's memories had been transmitted to the mind of the Earthling!</p>
    <p>At that moment, Thordred's wisdom was as great as that of his captor. Though he had not Ardath's potentiality for learning more, unearthly, amazing wisdom had been impressed on his brain cells. Thordred had smashed the machine, not through accident, but with coldly logical purpose. It would not do for Zana to acquire Ardath's wisdom also. With an effort, Thordred kept an expression of stupid wonder on his face. He must play his role carefully. Ardath must not yet suspect that another man shared his secrets.</p>
    <p>Ardath was speaking, carefully explaining things that his captive already knew. While Thordred seemed to listen, he swiftly pondered and discarded plans. Zana must die, of course. As for sleeping for centuries-- Well, it was not a pleasant thought. Ardath must be slain, so Thordred could return to Earth, with new knowledge.</p>
    <p>"The giants you saw in the sky," said Ardath, "were not real. They were three-dimensional projections, enlarged by my apparatus. I recorded the originals of those beings ages ago, when they actually lived and fought cave-bears and saber-toothed tigers."</p>
    <p>No, they were merely images, but men had seen them and remembered. The panic in the city below had died. In its place grew superstitious dread, fostered by the priests. Time passed, and neither Zana nor Thordred returned. New rulers arose to sit upon the black throne.</p>
    <p>But on the Mountain of the Gods, men toiled under the lash of the priests. Monstrous images of stone rose against the sky, gap-mouthed, fearsome images in crude similitude of the devils who had come out of the sunset.</p>
    <p>"They may return," the priests warned. "But the stone giants on the mountain will frighten them away. Build them higher! They will guard our city."</p>
    <p>On the peak the blind, alien faces glared ever into the sunset. And the days fled into years, and the dark centuries shrouded Earth. Continents crumbled. The eternal seas rose and washed new shores.</p>
    <p>But the blind gods stayed to guard that which no longer needed guarding. And still they watch, those strange, alien statues on Easter Island.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
     <p>Growth</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>New Year's Day, 1941, was a momentous hour for Stephen Court. Most of December, 1940, he had spent in his laboratories, engrossed with a task the nature of which he explained to no one. The great Wisconsin mansion, where he lived with his staff, had been metamorphosed into a fortress of science, though from the outside it resembled merely an antique, dilapidated structure. But nearby villagers viewed with suspicion the activity around Court's home.</p>
    <p>The local post-office was deluged with letters and packages. At all hours automobiles arrived, carrying cryptic burdens for Court.</p>
    <p>Slyly the villagers questioned Sammy, for he often wandered into the combination store and post office, to sit by the stove and puff great, reeking fumes from his battered pipe. Sammy had not changed much with the years. His hair had turned white, and there were merely a few more creases in his brown face. Since moving to Wisconsin, Stephen had relaxed the anti-liquor restriction, but Sammy had learned the value of moderation.</p>
    <p>"What's going on up at your place?" the storekeeper asked him, proffering a bottle.</p>
    <p>Sammy drank two measured gulps and wiped his lips.</p>
    <p>"The Lord only knows," he sighed. "It's way beyond me. Stevie's a swell boy, though. You can bet on that."</p>
    <p>"Yeah!" retorted somebody, with an angry snort. "He's a cold-blooded fish, you mean. The boy ain't human. He's got ice-water in his veins. Comes and goes without so much as a howdy-do."</p>
    <p>"He's thinking," Sammy defended sturdily. "Got a lot on his mind these days, Stevie has. He gets about two hours' sleep a night."</p>
    <p>"But what's he doin'?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know," admitted Sammy. "Inventing something, maybe."</p>
    <p>"More than likely he'll blow us all up one of these fine days," grunted the storekeeper. The loungers around the stove nodded in agreement. "Here's the tram coming in. Hear it?"</p>
    <p>Sammy settled himself more comfortably. 'There ought to be a package for Stevie, then."</p>
    <p>There was. The old man took the parcel and left the station. He stood for a time, watching toe train disappear into the distance. Its whistle sang a seductive song that aroused nostalgia in Sammy's bosom. He sighed, remembering the old days when he had been a hungry, carefree bindle-stiff. Well, he was better off now--well fed and cared for, without any worries. But it was nice to hear a train whistle- once in awhile. ...</p>
    <p>He climbed into the roadster and zoomed off toward the mansion. Ten minutes later he let himself into the hall, to be met by an anxious-eyed girl in a white uniform.</p>
    <p>"Did it come?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"Sure, Marion. Here it is."</p>
    <p>He gave her the parcel. Holding it tightly, she turned and hurried away.</p>
    <p>Since her arrival three years ago, Marion Barton had become a fixture in the house. She had been hired, at first, as a temporary laboratory assistant, during the absence of the regular one. But she had interested Court who saw surprising capabilities in her.</p>
    <p>The fact that Marion was altogether lovely--slim, brown-eyed, dark-haired, with a peach complexion and remarkably kissable lips--meant nothing at all to Court. He merely catalogued her as a perfect physical specimen, thoroughly healthy, and concentrated on the more interesting occupation of investigating her mind. What he found there pleased him.</p>
    <p>"She's intelligent," he told Sammy, "and she is meticulously careful. I've never seen her make a mistake. She's such a perfect assistant for me that we work in complete harmony. The girl seems to know exactly what I want, whether to hand me a scalpel or a lens, and she's completely unemotional. I shall keep her on, Sammy, and train her."</p>
    <p>"Uh-huh," said the old man, nodding wisely. "She does all that, and she's completely unemotional, eh? Well, maybe so. Sure she ain't in love with you, Stevie?"</p>
    <p>"Rot!" Court snapped, but it made him think it was necessary to warn Marion. "I'll pay you well," he explained to her, "and give you an invaluable training. But I have no time for emotional unbalance. I cannot afford distractions. Do you understand me?"</p>
    <p>"Well," Marion observed with desperate levity, "I'll wear horn-rimmed glasses if you want, and hoop-skirts if my legs distract you."</p>
    <p>"Not at all. I merely mean that there must be no question of any--well--infatuation."</p>
    <p>Marion was silent for a moment, though her eyes sparkled dangerously.</p>
    <p>"All right," she said quietly. "I won't fall in love with you, Mr. Court. Is that satisfactory?"</p>
    <p>"Quite," Court said.</p>
    <p>He turned away, obviously dismissing the subject, while Marion glared at his retreating back. ...</p>
    <p>She was remembering this scene now as she went into Court's laboratory. He was bent over a table, one eye to a microscope, his lips tensely pursed. Marion waited till he had finished his count. He straightened and saw her.</p>
    <p>"Got it?" he asked calmly. "Good."</p>
    <p>Court ripped open the package and drew out a small, leather-bound notebook. Hastily he flipped through the pages. His strong, tanned face darkened.</p>
    <p>"Wait a minute, Marion," he called as the girl moved to leave. "I want to talk to you."</p>
    <p>"Yes?"</p>
    <p>"Er--this is New Year's Eve, I know. Had you planned on doing anything tonight?"</p>
    <p>Marion's brown eyes widened. She stared at Court in amazement. Was he trying to date her?</p>
    <p>"Why, I did plan on--"</p>
    <p>"I should appreciate it," he said, without a trace of embarrassment, "if you would stay and help me with some research tonight. I regret having to say this, but it's rather important. I want to verify certain tests."</p>
    <p>"I'll stay," Marion assented briefly, but she flushed.</p>
    <p>"Good. Stain these slides, please."</p>
    <p>For several hours the two worked in silence. Court engrossed with his microscope, the girl busy dyeing the samples. Finally Court exhausted a small tank and conducted experiments in the vacuum he had created.</p>
    <p>Time dragged on, till the huge old house was utterly still. The chill of a Wisconsin winter blanketed it, making frost patterns on the window panes. Inside the room it was warm enough, though snow lay thickly on the ground outside.</p>
    <p>Presently Marion slipped out of the room and returned bearing a tray of coffee and sandwiches. She set it on a table and glanced at Court. Standing by a window, he was idly smoking a cigarette.</p>
    <p>"Mr. Court--"</p>
    <p>"What is it?" he asked, without looking around. His face was upturned to the quiet night outside as he spoke again, not waiting for her answer. "Come here."</p>
    <p>Marion obeyed. She was astonished to see that Court's face was drawn and haggard, actually gray around the lips. But his eyes were feverishly bright.</p>
    <p>"Up there," he said, pointing. "Do you see anything?"</p>
    <p>The cold stars glittered frostily in an abyss of empty black. Some icy breath of the unknown seemed to blow down from the frigid, airless seas between the planets. Marion shuddered.</p>
    <p>"I see nothing unusual," she said.</p>
    <p>"Naturally. No one has. There's nothing visible, and yet--" Wearily he rubbed his forehead. "It's impossible that my experiments have lied."</p>
    <p>"Drink some coffee," Marion urged.</p>
    <p>Court followed her to the table and sat down. As she poured the steaming liquid, his somber eyes dwelt on her face.</p>
    <p>"Are you game for an airplane trip into Canada?" he asked abruptly.</p>
    <p>"Yes. When?"</p>
    <p>"As soon as I can arrange it. There's a man I must see, a-- a patient."</p>
    <p>Court gulped down untasted coffee and bunked tiredly.</p>
    <p>"You should get at least a little sleep."</p>
    <p>"Not yet. I don't know--" He came to a sudden decision. "Marion, you don't know anything about this experiment I'm working on. No one knows about it yet, except me. All this data I've been collecting lately has been for a purpose. You haven't any idea what that purpose is, have you?"</p>
    <p>"No, I haven't."</p>
    <p>"Well," Court declared, with curious calm, "it's simply this --I have reason to believe that the Earth is going to be destroyed. Wait a minute!" he cried hastily. "Perhaps I shouldn't have mentioned this till I was absolutely certain. But I want to talk to someone."</p>
    <p>His unrealized loneliness showed naked for an unguarded second on his face. He caught himself, and was once more impassive.</p>
    <p>"The Earth is going to face a plague that will destroy civilization. Of that, at least, I am certain."</p>
    <p>"A plague," she breathed.</p>
    <p>"I call it that, for lack of a better term. Every being on this planet will be affected by it."</p>
    <p>Marion looked at him sharply. Her lovely eyes narrowed.</p>
    <p>"Affected? Don't you mean destroyed?"</p>
    <p>Court pushed back his chair and rose.</p>
    <p>"No," he whispered. "I don't." His grave lips went hard. "Come here, Marion. Look at this."</p>
    <p>He strode to a safe in the wall, opened it, and withdrew a small oblong box of lead. Set in one face was a round, transparent disc.</p>
    <p>"Look through the lens," he commanded. "Don't get too close to that thing, though."</p>
    <p>Marion obeyed. Through the tiny pane, she could see within the box a shining lump of matter, no larger than the nail of her thumb.</p>
    <p>"It's phosphorescent," she said. "What is it--an ore?"</p>
    <p>"A specimen of flesh taken from the thigh of a man named Pierre Locicault, a French-Canadian."</p>
    <p>"Flesh?" The girl peered again at the object. "Was he exposed to radium?"</p>
    <p>Court replaced the box in the safe.</p>
    <p>"No, nothing like that. Locicault lived in a little settlement in a valley in the wilderness. A month ago he staggered into the nearest town, emaciated and nearly dead. His story was just about unbelievable. He claimed that one day a heavy fog--abnormally heavy--blanketed his valley, and affected the inhabitants peculiarly.</p>
    <p>"They became incredibly hungry, ate enormous meals. Their skin became hot to the point of high fever. And they grew so old that most of them died. Locicault went for help, but nobody recognized him when he arrived in town. He looked thirty years older. What does that suggest to you, Marion?"</p>
    <p>"Increased metabolism," she said unhesitatingly.</p>
    <p>"Exactly. A rescue party was sent out. They found the corpses of a dozen old men and women in the valley, but no sign of what killed them. There was no sign of a fog, nor anything dangerous. Meanwhile, Locicault was luckily put into an isolation ward in the hospital. He ate tremendously. It was noticed that his skin emitted radiation. In the dark, his body actually shone."</p>
    <p>Court lit a cigarette for a few abstracted puffs before continuing.</p>
    <p>"His nurse caught the contagion. She killed herself. Locicault is kept in utter isolation now, for there isn't a doctor or a nurse who dares to get near him. When Doctor Granger wired me, I suggested lead insulation, so he could obtain this specimen for me to study. I want to see Locicault and make further experiments upon him."</p>
    <p>Marion frowned. "You have other evidence, of course?"</p>
    <p>"Naturally. Similar cases have been reported to me. This isn't anything new. Do you remember, about seven years ago, a newspaper story about a valley in France where the inhabitants were killed by a heavy fog? It was attributed to poison gas. Do you remember that West Indian island where life was wiped out overnight, without any explanation at all? People talked about volcanic gas.</p>
    <p>"My files are full of apparently meaningless items like that. Freaks and sports bom to animals and humans. So-called ghost stories about apparitions that shone in the dark. There are dozens of other examples."</p>
    <p>The girl shuddered as she thought of the tag of flesh she had seen.</p>
    <p>"And do you think this is the beginning of a plague?"</p>
    <p>"My graphs and charts show an upward swing. These occurrences happen more frequently as time goes on. Whatever causes them is growing more powerful."</p>
    <p>"But what could cause such a thing?" the girl asked. "No virus could--"</p>
    <p>"Not a virus. Filterable or not, they could not cause cellular radioactivity. This menace--this unknown X--is certainly not a virus. I don't know its nature, nor where it comes from. Till I know those factors, I can do nothing."</p>
    <p>"Could it be a weapon of war?" Marion suggested.</p>
    <p>"You mean-- Well, scarcely! Once it's started, it's completely uncontrollable. X isn't man-made, for its record goes back too far for chemistry. It's a natural phenomenon, and our only clue is fog."</p>
    <p>"A gas?"</p>
    <p>Court nodded, and his eyes grew distant with thought.</p>
    <p>"Where does it come from--under the Earth? That's possible, of course, but hardly any of these cases have occurred in volcanic country. I think X comes from the interstellar void."</p>
    <p>Marion's eyes widened in horrified recollection.</p>
    <p>"That's why you've been getting those observatory reports! Photographs and spectra."</p>
    <p>Court grunted impatiently. "They showed nothing, and that's what I can't understand."</p>
    <p>"Maybe the conditions aren't right," Marion suggested. "Phosphorescence isn't visible in daylight. Perhaps X isn't visible in space."</p>
    <p>Court didn't move, but his fingers broke his cigarette in two.</p>
    <p>"What was that?" he demanded, startled. Before the girl could reply, he whistled sharply and turned to the window.</p>
    <p>Of course, a catalyst! Some element in our atmosphere makes X visible, and perhaps dangerous as well. In outer space it can't be seen, but when it comes in contact with some element in the air--I think you've got it, Marion!"</p>
    <p>He stared grimly at the dark sky.</p>
    <p>"Up there, yet it's invisible. Perhaps a cosmically huge cloud of it is drifting eternally through space. We're probably on the outer fringes, so we've touched only a few tiny, scattered wisps. When Earth plunges into the main body--"</p>
    <p>Court lifted a clenched fist, furious because he was such a tiny, insignificant figure against the mighty concourse of the starry void.</p>
    <p>"An element so alien that we can scarcely conceive of it! We can realize it exists only by seeing its effects on Earth. What is it? What physical laws govern that frightful matter? Or is it matter, as we know it?"</p>
    <p>He turned suddenly, his eyes hard and determined.</p>
    <p>"We're leaving for Canada; Charter a plane. I'll pack the equipment I will need."</p>
    <p>Marion paused at the door.</p>
    <p>"Mr. Court--" she began, and hesitated.</p>
    <p>"Well?"</p>
    <p>Somehow, though, she could find no words. In her mind was the picture of Court at the window, challenging the Universe. A champion of mankind, he had made a magnificent gesture.</p>
    <p>But then Marion saw his cold, grim eyes. Reading the expression in them, her face whitened as she realized suddenly that Court cared nothing at all for mankind. His motives were passionlessly selfish.</p>
    <p>He was not a champion. He was a scientist, cold, calculating, egocentric, challenging an opponent that threatened his existence.</p>
    <p>Whatever she had meant to say died in her throat, just as something died in her heart. She went out of the room and closed the door quietly behind her.</p>

     <p>Jansaiya</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>It was dark in the forest, though sunlight filtered down wanly through the branches. Truly the Earth had changed since Ardath had first set foot upon it.</p>
    <p>He was not entirely pleased as he strode along, matching step with the gigantic Thordred. It did not seem to him that this world would be a suitable dwelling place. Thousands of years had passed since Ardath had taken Thordred from his home. Weary centuries had passed in ageless slumber, and a new civilization had risen. But somehow Ardath did not feel at home in this time. He sensed a subtle strangeness in the very air about him.</p>
    <p>He sighed a little wearily. His plans had gone amiss. The death of Zana, the Amazon queen, had taken him by surprise. He had hoped to retain her as a mate for Thordred, but without apparent cause, the woman's sleep had changed to death.</p>
    <p>A fleeting suspicion of Thordred had "passed through Ardath's mind, but he dismissed it. Though he had several poisons which might have caused such symptoms, Thordred could not possibly know of their existence nor how to use them. Not by a word or a thought had Thordred revealed that his brain held all the knowledge that had been Ardath's alone.</p>
    <p>The two of them had set out to examine this new civilization, leaving the space ship safely hidden in the forest. They had captured two natives, learned their language by means of the thought-transference machine, and taken their clothing. With all memory of the encounter wiped from their minds by means of Ardath's strange science, the natives were released.</p>
    <p>"They are puny folk today," Thordred said, his savage face twisting into a grin as he shifted the toga about his broad shoulders. "These garments scarcely cover me."</p>
    <p>Our own garments might have caused comment," Ardath explained. "Let us hope that your size won't mark you for an alien."</p>
    <p>Thordred spat in vicious contempt.</p>
    <p>"I don't fear these weaklings. Why can I not carry a weapon, Lord?"</p>
    <p>"I am armed," Ardath said quietly.</p>
    <p>The huge Earthling did not answer. He had not wished to accompany Ardath on this expedition. If Thordred could have remained in the ship, he would have had free access to the laboratory. After that, there would be no need to fear Ardath or anyone else. But he had not dared to object when his captor ordered him to follow.</p>
    <p>The forest thinned and the two men came out into blinding sunlight. Starting at their feet, the ground sloped down to a broad, shallow basin, a valley where a city lay. To the north was the serrated horizon of mountain peaks. Apparently they were volcanoes, for smoke plumed up lazily from one and spread in a dark blot against the blue sky.</p>
    <p>"This is their chief city," Ardath stated. "Remember, if anyone asks, we are farmers from the outer provinces."</p>
    <p>Thordred nodded, grinning more broadly than before. A farmer! His mighty hands were accustomed to sword-hilts, not the handles of plows. But he had good reason not to argue.</p>
    <p>The metropolis was unwalled. Several unpaved but well trodden roads led into it, along which wains and wagons were creaking in and out. Most of the houses were of wood, some of stone, and a few of marble. Those built of marble were mostly temples.</p>
    <p>Crowds filled the streets. There seemed to be two types of beings here. The roughly clad, bronzed peasant class, walked or drove their wagons. The aristocracy were carried in palanquins. There were soldiers, too, armed horsemen who nevertheless seemed slight compared with Thordred's giant frame.</p>
    <p>"Here," Ardath said, nodding toward a low doorway. "Taverns are good places to hear gossip."</p>
    <p>They entered the inn, found themselves in a large room, broad and long, but low-raftered. The stench of wine and beer was choking. Lamps illuminated the darker corners. Crude tables were set here and there, at which men lounged, drinking, cursing and laughing. Two bearded seamen were throwing dice on the floor.</p>
    <p>"We are thirsty," Ardath said to the waiter who appeared.</p>
    <p>He did not drink from the wine-cup that was set before him. Thordred, however, drained his at a gulp, and shouted for more.</p>
    <p>"You are strangers here?" the innkeeper asked.</p>
    <p>He took the coins Ardath gave him--curious bronze disks engraved with a cross within a circle. They had come from the pockets of the two natives Ardath had captured.</p>
    <p>"Yes. It is our first visit."</p>
    <p>"You come to trade?"</p>
    <p>"No," Ardath replied. "We are here to catch a glimpse of the woman whose fame has traveled even to the outer provinces. Men say that her beauty is blinding."</p>
    <p>"So?" The landlord asked, his eyebrows lifting. "What is her name?"</p>
    <p>"That I do not know," Ardath said. "But I can draw her features."</p>
    <p>He took from his garments a stylus of his own devising and hastily sketched a face on the boards of the table. The likeness was so nearly photographic that the innkeeper instantly recognized it.</p>
    <p>"By the Mountain, you are an artist. That's Jansaiya, the priestess. She's beautiful enough, or so men say, only you can't see her. The priestesses of Dagon never leave their temple, and men can worship only during the Sea Festival. Once a year, men gaze on Jansaiya as she serves the god. You have ten months to wait."</p>
    <p>"I see," Ardath said, his face falling unhappily. "And where is this temple?"</p>
    <p>Having learned the directions, they left the inn.</p>
    <p>"Why do you wish to see this wench?" Thordred grunted.</p>
    <p>"She is the wisest in this time," Ardath said. "I learned that before we landed here."</p>
    <p>Hovering high over the land in his space ship, he had located Jansaiya with his ray device, and noted her high intelligence. The unexpected death of Zana the Amazon still rankled in him. He had determined to secure a substitute, and Jansaiya was the logical one. She would accompany Ardath and Thordred into time, for he had decided not to remain in this civilization. It did not fulfill his requirements.</p>
    <p>The two men reached the outskirts of the temple. As yet Ardath had not decided on any definite plan, knowing that first he must find the priestess.</p>
    <p>"Wait here," he said. "Do not move away till I return."</p>
    <p>The giant drew back in the shelter of a tree, watching Ardath cross the thoroughfare toward a gate where a soldier lounged on his spear.</p>
    <p>The guard straightened, ready to challenge the Kyrian's entry into the city. Suddenly his eyes went blank and blind as they met Ardath's. Ordinary hypnotism worked well on these superstitious folk.</p>
    <p>Ardath went through the gate. The bulk of a temple rose before him. Built of porphyry and onyx and rose marble, it seemed to rest on the sward as lightly as gossamer. Despite its hugeness, it had been constructed with an eye for proportion, so that it. was utterly lovely, a symphony in stone. A curving stairway rose toward bronze gates that stood ajar, with a soldier on guard at each side.</p>
    <p>Quietly Ardath went on. The guards did not move, once they had felt the impact of his gaze.</p>
    <p>He entered the temple, found it vast, with a high-arched dome, and smoky with incense. The floor was green as the sea. Jade-green, too, was the flat-topped altar that loomed before him.</p>
    <p>Behind the altar the sacred trident reared, and smoke coiled lazily about its prongs. A shaven-headed, soft-faced priest turned to face Ardath.</p>
    <p>"You have come to pay homage to Dagon," he said, rather than asked. "Where are your tributes? Do you come empty-handed?"</p>
    <p>Ardath decided to change his tactics.. He fixed his stare upon the priest, summoning all his will. The man hesitated, spoke a few thick words, and drew back.</p>
    <p>"You--seem strange," he muttered. "Your form changes."</p>
    <p>To the hypnotized priest it seemed as though a light mist had gathered about Ardath's body. It thickened and swirled, and suddenly where had been the figure of a man was something entirely different.</p>
    <p>It was Dagon, the sea god, as the priest pictured him in his own imagination!</p>
    <p>The man went chalk-white. He collapsed on the floor, so paralyzed with fright and amazement that for a moment Ardath feared he had fainted.</p>
    <p>"You know me," Ardath said softly.</p>
    <p>"Great Master, forgive your servant. . . ."</p>
    <p>The priest babbled frantic incoherent prayers that sounded like gibberish.</p>
    <p>"Bring the priestess Jansaiya to me," Ardath commanded.</p>
    <p>"At once! At once!"</p>
    <p>The man backed behind a tapestry and was gone. Ardath lifted ironic eyebrows, for this was altogether too easy. When he felt under his robe for certain weapons he had brought with him from the ship, he nodded. Hypnotism was a ticklish trick. It was undependable, whereas weapons were not.</p>
    <p>But the priest returned, leading a veiled, slight, feminine figure. Both bowed to the floor.</p>
    <p>Ardath lifted the girl to her feet. He pulled aside the veil, found that no deception had been practiced upon him. This was the priestess, the beautiful Jansaiya. . . .</p>

     <p>CHAPTER VI.</p>
     <p>Unforgettable Land</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Wonderfully lovely she was, with elfin, childlike features that somehow held a certain sophistication, and even a suggestion of inherent, latent cruelty. Her hair was bright gold, her eyes sea-green. Though she was tiny as a nereid, her delicately symmetrical figure was not in the least childlike.</p>
    <p>She came closer to Ardath. Suddenly he felt a searing pain on his arm and drew away sharply.</p>
    <p>"This is no god!" Jansaiya cried, her voice like tinkling silver bells. "Blood flows through his veins. He is human, and an impostor!"</p>
    <p>She drew away, a small dagger still clenched in her hand. Ardath glanced wryly at the long scratch on his arm, yet he caught the quick stir of movement.</p>
    <p>As though by magic, the temple was full of shaven-headed priests. From behind the tapestried walls they came swiftly, forming a ring about Ardath. Their steel swords glittered no less coldly than their eyes.</p>
    <p>"We, too, know something of hypnotism," one of them rasped in contempt. "There are ways of testing even gods."</p>
    <p>Ardath thought quickly. His foes were at least two score. Hypnotism would be useless now, but he had other weapons. Under his gown was a projector that would have slain every priest in the temple, if he had cared to use it.</p>
    <p>He did not. Ardath's alien philosophy forbade the unnecessary taking of Me. Instead, his hand, hidden in a fold of the toga, moved almost imperceptibly. A tiny crystalline sphere dropped to the green tiles of the floor and Ardath put his sandalled foot over it.</p>
    <p>"Do you yield?" the leader of the priests asked.</p>
    <p>Ardath smashed the globe with his sole, at the same time holding his breath.</p>
    <p>Instantly a colorless, odorless gas diffused through the temple. The priests no longer could move. Frozen statue-like, they stood gripping their weapons and staring blindly straight ahead. The gas had a certain anaesthetic quality which warped their time-sense and slowed down their reactions tremendously. To their slowed vision, it seemed as though Ardath vanished instantaneously when he stepped aside.</p>
    <p>Hastily he looked around, still holding his breath. The temple was silent. No new enemy had appeared. Ardath wrenched a sword from a motionless priest and held it lightly in his right hand. He strode quickly to the priestess and lifted her under one arm. Ardath was no giant, but his muscles were steel-strong, and Jansaiya was tiny.</p>
    <p>Carrying his light captive, he hurried out of the temple.</p>
    <p>The two guards at the gate had not moved. They remained passive as Ardath descended the stairs and went through the outer portal into the street. The sentry there was also motionless and silent.</p>
    <p>But behind Ardath rose a clamor and an outcry.</p>
    <p>Nowhere could huge Thordred be seen. He had not waited. Perhaps he had been taken prisoner.</p>
    <p>Ardath's first step now was to return to the ship. After that, when the Kyrian gathered more resources, Thordred could be rescued. But at that moment there was no time for delay.</p>
    <p>Bending low, Ardath ran along the street. The noise of pursuit followed close behind him, abruptly swelling to a thunder of iron hoofs. Down upon the Kyrian rode a horseman in glittering armor, sword lifted in menace. The bearded soldier shouted a searing curse. Out of the temple gates the priests poured.</p>
    <p>"Slay him!" they yelled as they raced after Ardath. "Slay him!"</p>
    <p>Ardath had no time to employ any weapon but the sword that was bare in his hand. He threw Jansaiya aside, out of danger. Quickly he reversed the blade, gripping it by the point. As the horseman thundered down, he flung the steel like a club.</p>
    <p>The street exploded into a blinding blur of action. Ardath dodged aside as ringing hoofs clashed on the pavement. The soldier's sword screamed ominously through the air, but Ardath's missile had found its mark. Its heavy hilt had smashed against the horseman's bare forehead. The man was slumped in his saddle, unconscious. The weight of his sword had completed the slash.</p>
    <p>Instantly Ardath was at the reins. He dragged the soldier down and sprang lightly into the saddle. He wheeled the mount. Reaching low over the side, he picked up Jansaiya and gently though swiftly put the limp figure across the saddle before him. The horse reared and charged down the street, scattering yelling priests before its thundering hoofs.</p>
    <p>Never before had Ardath ridden a horse, nor even seen one of its kind. But eons ago, in the Miocene Age, he had studied the small, fleet Neohipparion. He instantly recognized the similarity between the modern and the prehistoric desert horse. Animals had never feared nor distrusted Ardath, for he understood them too well. The steed responded to the least touch of his hands and heels. Through the city it raced.</p>
    <p>Three times Ardath had to use his sword, but only to disarm. It was not necessary to kill. Suddenly, then, the city was behind him, and he was racing up the slope toward the forest.</p>
    <p>It was already late afternoon. The shadows lay long and dark on the sward. Ardath cast a glance behind him, saw that a horde of horsemen were riding hard in pursuit. He shrugged indifferently and looked down at Jansaiya.</p>
    <p>Undisturbed, she still slept. He studied her face, realizing that it was lovely beyond imagination, though the perfect lips were somewhat arrogant, a little cruel. With his knowledge to combat those traits, he could make her a fit mate for any superior man.</p>
    <p>But what had happened to Thordred? Ardath was beginning to grow worried. He could do nothing till he reached the ship, though.</p>
    <p>It was sunset before he did. The titanic sphere rose above the tree-tops as it lay cradled in a clearing. A port was wide open, just as he had left it, but across the gap shimmered a pallid curtain of white radiance.</p>
    <p>Ardath reined in, sprang from the saddle. Snatching down Jansaiya in his arms, he called out sharply.</p>
    <p>"Thordred!"</p>
    <p>Instantly the giant came out of a thicket, his savage face inscrutable.</p>
    <p>Follow me," Ardath commanded briefly, and went toward the ship.</p>
    <p>As he neared the port, the flickering curtain died. He entered, carrying his burden, and Thordred followed.</p>
    <p>Ardath turned when they were all inside. The horse was quietly grazing where he had left it. When he heard the distant sound of shouting, constantly growing louder, Ardath sighed. He put Jansaiya down and closed the port. Seating himself without haste at the control panel, he sent the ship arrowing up from the forest.</p>
    <p>The vessel hung in the air, hovering motionless. Ardath turned to Thordred.</p>
    <p>"You tried to enter the ship," he said quietly. "I had forbidden that. Why did you try to do so?"</p>
    <p>Thordred flushed, trying to evade that piercing though gentle stare.</p>
    <p>"I came as far as the temple doors. When I saw the priests capture you, I thought you were helpless. I was unarmed, so I came back to the ship to find some weapon to aid you."</p>
    <p>For a long, tense moment, Ardath's inscrutable gaze dwelt on the giant.</p>
    <p>"No one can enter here save by my will," he said. "You would do well to obey me in future."</p>
    <p>Thordred nodded hastily and changed the subject.</p>
    <p>"The girl is awakening."</p>
    <p>Jansaiya's green eyes slowly opened. The instant she saw Ardath, horror and hatred sprang into her gaze.</p>
    <p>She looked then at the crafty Thordred. Suddenly and unmistakably, the giant Earthling realized that he had found an ally against Ardath. But he said nothing.</p>
    <p>He waited, silent and passive, while Ardath spoke to Jansaiya in her own language, explaining why she had been abducted.</p>
    <p>She listened attentively, and the Kyrian knew she did not regard him as a god or a demon.</p>
    <p>Not for nothing had he sought out the most intelligent human of this particular time.</p>
    <p>The Sun was setting when Ardath finished his explanation. Through the transparent window of a port, they could see the land that stretched beneath them, green and beautiful. Smoke plumed up from the volcanic range. The city, tiny and white, lay in the distance.</p>
    <p>"You intend to put me to sleep?" Jansaiya asked incredulously. "For a thousand years?"</p>
    <p>"A thousand or more," Ardath said quietly. "Your civilization does not suit my needs. Do you love it so well that you would refuse?"</p>
    <p>"No," she responded. "Return to be imprisoned in Dagon's temple once more? No, I am glad to be free! But to have to leave my world forever. . . ."</p>
    <p>"Kingdoms die," Ardath pointed out. "Civilizations pass like shadows. When we awake, perhaps no man will remember your land."</p>
    <p>Jansaiya rose and went to the port. The red Sun cast bloody light on her face.</p>
    <p>"You are wrong," she whispered. "I am your prisoner. I have no choice but to obey. Yet if we sleep for a hundred thousand years, men will not forget my kingdom. All over Earth our ships carry wondrous goods. Our civilization is the mightiest in the world.</p>
    <p>"It cannot die or pass. It will go on, through the ages, growing mightier. Not even the gods can destroy this land. Not even Dagon, Lord of the Sea, can destroy Atlantis!"</p>

     <p>CHAPTER VII.</p>
     <p>Doom</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>On the 2nd of January, 1941, Stephen Court left for Canada. His cabin plane contained two passengers and a good deal of equipment. Marion Barton went with him, and he had allowed Sammy to go along. The old man had been reformed in every other respect, but wanderlust can be removed from a man only by the surgery of death.</p>
    <p>"I won't be no trouble, Stevie," he had argued. "I get itchy feet this time of year, and, besides, I never rode in an airplane. Anyhow"--his watery eyes narrowed cunning--"you'll need a handyman to do odd jobs. I can help you unpack and other things."</p>
    <p>To save argument that would waste time, Court had agreed. It was a clear, bitingly cold day when the plane took off from the Wisconsin flying field. Luckily the weather reports were good. Though there was no danger of snow, Court flew at low altitude, fearing that ice would form on the wings.</p>
    <p>The excitement of hurtling the plane at high speed made him uncharacteristically talkative. His gaunt cheeks were flushed, and he chatted with the others with unusual animation and warmth. Sammy did not talk much, but he listened and occasionally asked a question.</p>
    <p>"Plague, eh?" he said once. "I was in the South once when a plague hit. It was pretty awful. Kids and women--we couldn't bury 'em fast enough. I sure hope it ain't like that."</p>
    <p>"We'll see," Court said. "I can't do much till I examine this fellow Locicault. For that matter--" He frowned, pondering. "I really haven't enough equipment with me. I've got to bring Locicault back to my lab."</p>
    <p>"But you say it's contagious," Marion protested. "How can he travel?"</p>
    <p>"I've arranged that. I'm having an ambulance made ready. It'll be plated with several thicknesses of lead, which ought to be safe enough. They're sending the car after me as soon as it's ready."</p>
    <p>"Oh," Marion said.</p>
    <p>She fell silent, watching the mountains and lakes glide past below.</p>
    <p>"You know," Court observed after a time, "I came across an interesting angle, a completely unexpected one. I've been getting photographs from most of the observatories. While I found no trace or my X in space, I did notice something else --a satellite of some kind circling the Earth. No one's noticed it before, it's so small and travels so fast. But it seems to be made of homogeneous metal."</p>
    <p>"Iron?"</p>
    <p>"Smooth metal, Marion. Not pitted and rough, as an asteroid would be. It's made of pure gold, or some yellow metal that resembles gold."</p>
    <p>The girl looked sharply at Court.</p>
    <p>"A space ship?"</p>
    <p>"Possibly. But why wouldn't it come down, if it is a ship? Has it been circling the Earth for ages?"</p>
    <p>"But where could it have come from?"</p>
    <p>"Some ancient civilization might have mastered space travel, though I doubt that. If it is a space ship, it probably came from some other planet."</p>
    <p>"There's nothing in history about it," Marion said. "If one space ship could come here, probably so would a lot more."</p>
    <p>"Nothing in history? No, but there's a lot in mythology and folklore. I'm just guessing, of course. I'm anxious to find out more about that highly unnatural satellite."</p>
    <p>She was silent, fascinated by the thought.</p>
    <p>"How can you reach it?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"It looks impossible," he admitted. "Space travel is impossible to us today. That's one reason--You see, Marion, if it really is a space ship, it may mean Earth's salvation. To be completely rational, we must consider that perhaps the plague can't be conquered. If it is a space ship, we may be able to leave the Earth and go to another planet. If those worlds are also in danger, we could leave the System.</p>
    <p>"We couldn't do that with modern rocket fuels. Suppose that strangely colored satellite is a genuine space ship, one that has already traveled across the interstellar void. Repairing it would be less work than inventing one."</p>
    <p>"It's worth trying," Marion breathed hopefully.</p>
    <p>"I may fail. That's why I want to find out more about X. The space ship's a dangerously long chance, and I don't want to gamble everything on one throw of the dice. When I see Locicault--"</p>
    <p>Time wore on. Sammy asked innumerable questions about the plague, but when he exhausted his curiosity, he went to sleep. The plane sped over the Border and into Canada.</p>
    <p>It was afternoon before they reached the landing field. An automobile met them and took them into town, another following with Sammy and the equipment. At the hospital they were greeted by Doctor Granger, a shriveled gnome of a man with one tuft of white hair standing straight up from his bald skull.</p>
    <p>"Court!" he said in relief. "Am I glad you're here! Are you hungry?"</p>
    <p>"No." Characteristically Court did not bother to introduce anyone. "Where's the patient?"</p>
    <p>"In the left wing of the hospital. We've cleared out everyone else. You'll have to put on the lead suit. We have only one, unfortunately."</p>
    <p>Court seemed transformed into a swift, emotionless machine. He hastily donned the form-fitting suit of canvas, with leaden scales sewed closely over the surface. As he followed Granger to the door, the physician paused.</p>
    <p>"I'd better not go farther. I don't know exactly how far the radiation extends. It wilts gold-leaf at quite some distance."</p>
    <p>Court nodded, got his directions, and clumped ponderously out the door. He went along the corridor until he found the patient's room. Any other man would have hesitated before entering, but Court was not like any other man. Without stopping, he pushed open the door.</p>
    <p>The bare, white-walled chamber was spotlessly sterile. A case of instruments lay open on a table, a hypodermic needle in view. On the bed a man was sprawled.</p>
    <p>Peering through lead-infiltrated goggles, Court came closer. Locicault was unconscious. No, he was asleep. His spare, wasted frame was barely fleshy enough to make a visible shape under the coverlets. On the pillow lay the withered, skull-face of an incredibly old man.</p>
    <p>Locicault was twenty-three years of age.</p>
    <p>His mouth was toothless. Hanging open helplessly, it revealed his ugly, blackened gums. His skull was hairless, with ears that were large and malformed, and his nose, too, was enlarged. The repulsive skin dangled in loose, sagging wrinkles. Pouches hung slack on his naked skull.</p>
    <p>Court went to the window and drew down the shades. In the gloom a queer, silvery light was visible at once. It came from the patient's face!</p>
    <p>Court stripped off the covers, exposing Locicault's gaunt, nude body. Like the ghastly face, it gleamed with a silvery radiance that did not pulse or wane, but remained steady.</p>
    <p>"Locicault," Court called out sharply.</p>
    <p>When he gripped the thin shoulder, the man shuddered convulsively and his eyes opened.</p>
    <p>They were not human eyes. They were pools of white radiance, like shining smoke in eye-sockets.</p>
    <p>"Locicault, can you hear me?" Court asked quietly.</p>
    <p>A cracked whisper came from the withered lips.</p>
    <p>"Yes. . . . Yes, m'sieu."</p>
    <p>"Can you see me?"</p>
    <p>"I can--No, m'sieu, not with my eyes. I am blind--but I can see you, somehow--"</p>
    <p>Court frowned, puzzled, as he pondered the weird reply.</p>
    <p>"What do you see?"</p>
    <p>"You are covered with--armor, I think. I do not know how I can tell this. I am blind. . . ."</p>
    <p>"I am a doctor," Court said. "If you can talk without pain, I want you to answer some questions."</p>
    <p>"Out, m'sieu. Bien."</p>
    <p>"Are you in pain?"</p>
    <p>"No--Yes. I am hungry. It is strange. I am hungry and thirsty, but I do not want food. Something I do not understand--"</p>
    <p>Court waited for him to continue. When Locicault did not, he went on with another line of reasoning.</p>
    <p>"Tell me about this fog."</p>
    <p>"There is not much to tell," Locicault said painfully. "When I left my home, I could not find my way. The fog was so heavy--and its smell was not right."</p>
    <p>Stephen's eyes sparkled with interest under the thick mask.</p>
    <p>"How did it smell? What did it remind you of?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know. Wait! Once I was in the big power-house at the dam, and it smelled like that--"</p>
    <p>Ozone? Court shook his head.</p>
    <p>"Well?" he urged.</p>
    <p>"The fog was cold at first, and then it seemed to grow warmer. I had the strange feeling it was getting inside of me. My lungs began to burn like fire. My heart beat faster. I was hungry, yet I had just eaten . . . Doctor," Locicault said suddenly, without moving, "I am changing--more and more. When it started, I did not change much, but now--I feel like something that is not a man. Can you hear my voice?"</p>
    <p>"Yes," Court soothed.</p>
    <p>"That is odd. My mind is so wonderfully clear, but my senses--I do not seem to hear with my ears, nor speak with my tongue. I feel strong, though--and hungry--"</p>
    <p>His scrawny head slumped, and Court saw that he had lost consciousness.</p>
    <p>Whistling softly, with grim abstraction, Court returned to the main hospital where the others waited. Doffing his suit, he questioned Granger.</p>
    <p>"It's progressive, isn't it? Doesn't the radiation get stronger?"'</p>
    <p>"Why, yes," the physician replied. "For a time, anyway. Locicault was fearfully hungry. His metabolism was high, and this radiation got stronger every time we fed him. Yesterday, though, he refused to eat."</p>
    <p>"But he's hungry," Stephen protested.</p>
    <p>"So he says, and still he won't eat. The radiation is much fainter now."</p>
    <p>"I see," Court muttered. "Get me a guinea-pig, will you? A rabbit will do just as well, if you don't have a guinea-pig. I want to try something."</p>
    <p>Putting on the armor again and carrying a wriggling guinea-pig, Court went back to the patient. Locicault was still unconscious. For the first time, Court hesitated, staring at the pale aura surrounding Locicault's body. Then he slowly extended the guinea-pig till its furry side touched the patient's hand.</p>
    <p>Gently the weak, bony fingers constricted. Closing upon the tiny animal, they did not harm it though it struggled frantically to escape.</p>
    <p>The little beast went limp, seemed, amazingly, to grow smaller. Swiftly the phosphorescent gleam surrounding Locicault grew brighter.</p>
    <p>"So that's the way!" Court muttered under his breath.</p>
    <p>He disengaged the guinea-pig from the skeleton fingers and examined the animal. It was dead, as he had expected. Court silently returned to the others.</p>
    <p>"You haven't been feeding him the right way," he explained, struggling out of the armor. He gave it to the Granger, who put it on. "Locicault is changing, slowly and steadily, into some form of life that is definitely not human. At first he ate normally, though in vast quantity.</p>
    <p>"As his basic matter altered, Locicault lost the power to absorb food as we do, internally. He gets the energy direct-- like a vampire, to put it melodramatically. He will kill any living being that touches him."</p>
    <p>"Good God!" Granger cried in a shocked voice. "We can't let him live, Court!"</p>
    <p>"We must, because I need him. I have to study the course of the plague in its natural progress. Locicault must be fed whatever he needs now--rabbits, guinea-pigs, and so on. I shall take him to my home as soon as the special ambulance gets here."</p>
    <p>Sammy shuffled forward, wide-eyed with fear, but desperately stern.</p>
    <p>"Stevie, don't take any chances."</p>
    <p>Court ignored the old man as he ignored everyone else when his mind was absorbed.</p>
    <p>"Marion, unpack my equipment. The ambulance should be here by tomorrow or the next day. In the meantime, I want to check every angle. Be sure that there's a supply of small animals for the patient. I don't know yet how much energy he needs, but he's broadcasting it at a terrific rate."</p>
    <p>Granger, clumsy in the lead suit, already left the room. Court looked at his watch.</p>
    <p>"Lucky I got here in time. If Locicault had died--"</p>
    <p>"Can you save him?" she asked eagerly.</p>
    <p>"Of course not! I don't want to, even if I could. I want to stop the plague, and to do that, I must watch it run its course in a test subject. Locicault happens to be the only one we know about. There may be new cases at any time, but I can't afford to wait. For all I know, there may never be another case till the final crack-up. Then it will be too late to do anything."</p>
    <p>"What do you intend?" Marion asked, trying to hide her disappointment.</p>
    <p>"I shall take Locicault back home with me, keep him in isolation, and feed him whatever may be necessary. Eventually the plague will run its course. Locicault may not die, but he may have to be destroyed."</p>
    <p>The door slammed open. Granger burst into the room, ripped off the lead suit. His gnomish face was gray with horror.</p>
    <p>"Court, he's dead!"</p>
    <p>"What?" Court's jaw trembled with indecision. "No, he can't be. It's unconsciousness--" But already he was snatching the suit from Granger. "Get me adrenaline, quick, another guinea-pig!"</p>
    <p>They sprang to obey. Bearing his equipment, Court raced away. The minutes ticked slowly past, lagging unendurably. At last he came back, his shoulders slumped.</p>
    <p>"You're right, Granger," he muttered. "Locicault's dead. I was too late."</p>
    <p>"You--" the physician hesitated, biting his lips in helplessness. "You'll want to have an autopsy?"</p>
    <p>"No, it's no use. I must watch the progress of the plague on a living being. A corpse is no good for my purposes. I must wait . . . Perhaps the plague will strike again. I--I don't know."</p>
    <p>Court went to the window and looked out, his back to the others.</p>
    <p>"Take precautions with the burial," he said after a time speaking in a strange, tight voice. "The contagion can still be spread. No one must touch him without lead-armor. You will cremate him, of course."</p>
    <p>Marion came across the room to stand beside him.</p>
    <p>"You're not giving up, are you?" she whispered.</p>
    <p>"No, but I'm at a dead end now. Every hour I delay may mean--"</p>
    <p>The others had shuffled despondently out of the room.</p>
    <p>"We're going back, then?" Marion asked.</p>
    <p>"Yes. I'll take a few specimens from Locicault's body, but it s useless. I can't bring back life to a dead man. Damn him!" he snarled with sudden fury. "Why did he have to die?"</p>
    <p>Marion's lips trembled and she turned away. Court, after a brief hesitation, replaced the lead-glass helmet and went into the wing. He could, as a matter of routine, take samples of Locicault's blood and skin, though he knew that would do little good.</p>
    <p>Court opened the door of Locicault's room and stopped abruptly, catching his breath. The blood drained from his cheeks. He reached out almost blindly.</p>
    <p>"Sammy!" he whispered. "Oh, my God, you fool!"</p>
    <p>The old man stood motionless beside the bed. In the dimness his face could not be seen. His scant white hair was pale as silver.</p>
    <p>"Hello, Stevie," he said gently. "Don't go off the handle, now. After all, I'm not so young any more, and you needed a case of this plague to experiment on. If it's as contagious as you say, I guess I sure enough got it by now."</p>
    <p>"Sammy," Court whispered through dry lips. "Why--"</p>
    <p>He could not go on.</p>
    <p>"Why?" The old man shrugged. "I dunno. I told you about that plague down South, with women and kids dying like flies. I know what it's like. If I can help you save women and kids, Stevie, I figure I've done a pretty good job. So it's up to you now, boy. It's up to you."</p>

     <p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>
     <p>The Mystery of Dro-Ghir</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Ardath was worried. As he sat immersed in thought, within the laboratory of the golden ship, he felt that he was little nearer to his goal. The barbaric hordes that overran the Earth in this new era promised little. Only in the far Eastern lands did the flame of civilization burn.</p>
    <p>But would Ardath find a super-mentality' there? Would there be one he could take with him to a future age, to find a suitable mate? Or must he go on once more?</p>
    <p>There was another matter, too. Neither Jansaiya nor Thordred had proved as intelligent as he had expected. At times Thordred was almost obtuse, despite his eagerness to learn new things. A flash of suspicion crossed Ardath's mind. Perhaps Thordred was pretending stupidity--</p>
    <p>But why should he? Ardath, unused to guile and deceit, found the question difficult. He had saved Thordred's life, but humans were completely alien to Ardath. He had come from Kyria, a planet far across the Universe. He did not realize that humans sometimes mistrust and hate those greater than themselves, fearing power which, though benevolent, can also be used for evil. Besides, he knew that Thordred was ambitious, for the giant Earthman had conspired to win Zana's throne.</p>
    <p>Ardath rose from his seat and pressed a lever. The veil of flickering light that barred the doorway died. He stepped across the threshold, and once more the barrier flamed with shimmering deadliness. He stood watching Thordred and Jansaiya as they sat near a vision screen, intent on the scene pictured there.</p>
    <p>Thordred turned his vulture face, sensing Ardath's presence. "There is nothing new, Master."</p>
    <p>Ardath smiled somewhat sadly and shook his head.</p>
    <p>"How often must I tell you not to call me master? Because I have more knowledge than you, Thordred, does not mean that you are my slave. This eternal desire of Earthmen for enslavement ..."</p>
    <p>He shrugged bewilderedly and his thoughts went back to his home planet, Kyria, long since shattered into cosmic dust. Often he had dreamed of that world, which he had only seen on vision screens. Always he had awakened to this barbarous planet where men hated and fought and died for silly causes.</p>
    <p>Truly the road of the ages was long.</p>
    <p>Yet he knew there would be an end. Even here, in this Eastern land, the Kyrian had found a clue.</p>
    <p>"Thordred," he said slowly, "and you, too, Jansaiya--I must leave you for awhile."</p>
    <p>Intent on his thoughts, Ardath did not notice the quick glow that brightened the others' eyes.</p>
    <p>"There is a man here I must know, and a mystery I must solve," he continued. "Barbarous hordes have overrun this country, huge hairy giants from the North. They are little more than beasts, but at their head is a chieftain called Dro-Ghir. He puzzles me. His acts are wise. His brain seems highly developed, yet he is filled with the violent emotions of a savage. This is a paradox."</p>
    <p>Jansaiya's lovely eyes were narrowed. "You must leave us, you said?"</p>
    <p>Ardath nodded. "Remain in the ship till I return. There is plenty of food, and no danger can touch you. I have only one warning-- Do not attempt to enter the laboratory." He smiled as a thought came to him. "Though you know nothing of the apparatus there, yet you might harm yourselves."</p>
    <p>"We will obey," Thordred grunted, his harsh face immobile.</p>
    <p>Quickly Ardath made his preparations. As he opened the port, he turned. His gaze dwelt on Thordred, and there was a curiously mocking light in it.</p>
    <p>"Farewell, for a time. I shall rejoin you soon."</p>
    <p>He stepped out and was gone.</p>
    <p>The girl made a quick movement, but Thordred lifted his huge hand in warning.</p>
    <p>"Wait!" he whispered.</p>
    <p>They waited, while the minutes dragged past. At last Thordred arose and went to the laboratory door. He fumbled over the wall, and abruptly the flickering veil of light died. The giant's face twisted in a contemptuous grin.</p>
    <p>"Ardath is a fool," he rumbled. "Else he would never have left his laboratory unguarded, even though he does not realize that I know the secret of his brain."</p>
    <p>"But do you?" Jansaiya asked. She stood behind the giant, peering over his shoulder into the laboratory. "You know nothing of his thoughts since you drew the knowledge from his mind, and that was ages ago."</p>
    <p>"I know enough!" Thordred retorted, eyeing the apparatus wolfishly. "Enough to handle his weapons, once I get my hands on them. We shall follow Ardath now and slay him. Then this new world will be ready for conquests."</p>
    <p>"I am- afraid," the girl complained. "Do not try to kill Ardath. Sometimes I see that in his eyes which makes me tremble. He is not Earth-born. Let us flee, instead, to where he can never find us."</p>
    <p>"While he lives, we are not safe," Thordred growled. "Come!"</p>
    <p>He sprang across the threshold--and was flung back! A wall of flaming blue light reared viciously before him. Crackling, humming, blazing with azure fury, the strange veil rippled weirdly. Sick with amazement and baffled rage, Thordred drew back, a stinging pain in his arm and his side. Jansaiya cried out and fled into a corner.</p>
    <p>"He--he watches us!" the girl whimpered. "I did not think so, but now I know he is a demon!"</p>
    <p>Thordred was ashly-gray under his brown, hairy skin. His jaw muscles bunched. Like a beast he crouched, great hands shaking, as he glared at the ominous portal.</p>
    <p>"Quiet! He does not watch. Ardath is clever, that is all."</p>
    <p>"I do not understand--"</p>
    <p>"One lock on a door is good, but two are better. Ardath had put two locks on this one." Thordred growled deep in his throat. "Does he suspect me? If he does--" He shook his shaggy head. "No, it is a precaution anyone might take. Let me see."</p>
    <p>Thordred approached and gingerly tested the blue wall of light. It was as solid and resistant as metal.</p>
    <p>"It is a new thing. I know many of Ardath's secrets, though not this one. Perhaps I can learn how to destroy this barrier before he returns."</p>
    <p>Jansaiya began trembling with a new fear.</p>
    <p>"If you do not, he may destroy us. Hurry, Thordred!"</p>
    <p>"There is no need for haste. Let me see. . . ."</p>
    <p>The giant began testing the wall beside the door. Under his beetling brows, the amber cat's-eyes glowed as he worked. Presently sweat began to trickle down the swarthy face and run into the black beard. Could he find the secret of the barrier before Ardath returned?</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Ardath walked swiftly through the forest, his thoughts busy. The Kyrian had already forgotten Thordred and Jansaiya. He was pondering the mystery of the savage chief Dro-Ghir, whose actions were those of a genius, but who certainly did not resemble one in any way.</p>
    <p>In a far later age, Genghis Khan and Attila the Hun would ravage the Earth as Dro-Ghir did now. Centuries later, the walled cities of China would again fall victim to the invader, as they had fallen before Dro-Ghir. Out of the Northern steppes the hordes of this scourge had come, huge hairy men on horseback. Their villages were crude collections of dome-shaped huts--yurts, they were called.</p>
    <p>Eastward the ravagers had swept, and down the bleak coasts into Oriental lands. Westward they had been halted, for a time, by the vast mountain range that towered to the skies. In the South they had swarmed into a land of green, lush jungle and carved stone temples, where men worshiped Siva and Kali the Many-armed.</p>
    <p>Like an avalanche, the hoofs of the invaders thundered across the Earth.</p>
    <p>"Slay!" they shouted.</p>
    <p>Their curved swords glittered. Their horse-tail standards shook in the chill winds that followed them from the North. Their spears drank deep, lifted, dripping red! Great beast-faced giants who rode like centaurs and fought like devils, they bathed the East in rivers of blood.</p>
    <p>Slay! Show no mercy. Prisoners mutter and revolt, therefore take no prisoners. Only slay!</p>
    <p>Over these barbarians Dro-Ghir ruled.</p>
    <p>Ardath's vision screen had showed him that Dro-Ghir camped with a group of his men, not far away. But night had fallen before he reached the outposts and was accosted by a wary sentry.</p>
    <p>In the moonlight, the guard's face was like that of a gargoyle. He lifted his spear--and held k rigid as Ardath's gaze met and locked with his. A silent conflict flared without words or actions between the two men.</p>
    <p>As the stronger will mastered, the sentry turned and led the Kyrian into the midst of a group of goat-skin tents. Before the largest he paused. A few soldiers were sitting here and there by their fires. They looked up curiously, but none offered to interfere.</p>
    <p>The sentry lifted the tent-flap and Ardath entered. He felt an involuntary tension as he faced the baffling Dro-Ghir.</p>
    <p>A few small lamps of pottery, with wicks protruding from reeking animal-oil, cast a flickering yellowish gleam on the tent walls. There were some beast-skins scattered around haphazardly, but nothing more. A man reclined at length on a greasy fur, and he looked up sharply as the intruder entered.</p>
    <p>Dro-Ghir was a giant as huge as Thordred. He wore nothing but a loose robe, which left his shaggy breast bare. His thick black beard was shiny with oil. His long, thick mustache had been twisted into two short braids and tied with golden wire. A fur cap covered his head. His face was that of a blindly ferocious beast. The low brow slanted back. The thick lips 'revealed yellow, broken tusks. In the shallow eyes was little sign of intelligence.</p>
    <p>Ardath frowned in wonder. Was this the genius he sought?</p>

    <title>
     <p>CHAPTER IX.</p>
     <p>Li Yang</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Dro-Ghir surged up in one swift motion. His hand brought out a short throwing-spear, which he leveled at Ardath.</p>
    <p>"Li Yang!" he roared. "Come here!"</p>
    <p>Ardath had already taken pains to learn the language of the barbarian hordes.</p>
    <p>"I mean no harm," he began. "I merely--"</p>
    <p>"Peace, Lord," a new voice broke in. "He comes unarmed. Wait!"</p>
    <p>Someone was crouching in the shadows. Ardath peered intently into the darkness. He saw a gross lump of a man, an absurdly fat Oriental who sat cross-legged in the gloom. Sharp black eyes, almost hidden in the sagging pads of the bland round face, stared back at Ardath. The tiny, red lips were childlike, and the domelike skull was bald and shining. Li Yang wore a loose robe, girt about his bulging waist by a golden cord.</p>
    <p>Dro-Ghir had also swiveled to peer at the Oriental.</p>
    <p>"Hear his words," Li Yang counseled, and picked up a lutelike instrument at his side. Idly he strummed the strings as he gave his advice. "There is no harm in words."</p>
    <p>But Dro-Ghir did not release his grip on the spear. He stood with legs wide apart, watching Ardath.</p>
    <p>"Well?" he demanded.</p>
    <p>The Kyrian spread his hands in appeal.</p>
    <p>"I come in peace."</p>
    <p>"How did you get through the lines?"</p>
    <p>"That does not matter. I have a message for you."</p>
    <p>Dro-Ghir growled a savage threat deep in his throat.</p>
    <p>"Let him speak, Lord," Li Yang whispered. Then speak--but swiftly!"</p>
    <p>Swiftly Ardath told his story. He was still puzzled, and he grew more bewildered as he searched the dull, ferocious eyes of the chieftain. No understanding woke in them, yet Ardath plunged on, explaining his purpose, asking Dro-Ghir to come with him into time.</p>
    <p>Finally he finished. There was tense silence as the lamps sputtered and flickered eerily. At last the soft twang of the lute murmured vaguely.</p>
    <p>"What is your answer?" Ardath asked. Dro-Ghir tugged at his beard, while his hand was still clenched about the spear. Abruptly the Oriental broke in.</p>
    <p>"Lord, I think this foreigner has strange powers. It would be well to make him welcome."</p>
    <p>The Oriental heaved to his feet, a flabby behemoth from the furs, and the pudgy hand made a swift motion to Dro-Ghir. The chieftain hesitated. Then his face broke into a wolfish grin.</p>
    <p>"Good. We are not enemies, you and I. Break bread with me."</p>
    <p>Li Yang shuffled ponderously forward, thrust a cake of mealy, unleavened bread into Dro-Ghir's paw. The chieftain broke the cake into halves and handed Ardath one, stuffing the other into his capacious mouth. The crumbs that fell were caught in his filthy beard.</p>
    <p>Warily the Kyrian ate. Something was amiss here, though what is was, he did not know.</p>
    <p>"You will come with me?" he asked. "I am tired of using force. If you refuse, I shall merely leave you and continue my search."</p>
    <p>"Drink!" Dro-Ghir roared.</p>
    <p>He seized a hollowed horn from Li Yang and thrust it at Ardath. The Oriental gave Dro-Ghir another cup. The wine was hotly spiced and steaming. "In friendship--drink!"</p>
    <p>The barbarian chief lifted the horn to his lips and drained it. Ardath followed his example. Slowly he lowered the cup. Li Yang was back in his corner, strumming at the lute. His voice rose in a monotonous Oriental song. "All men see the petals of the rose drift down, the jasmine fades, the lotus passes. . . ."</p>
    <p>Dro-Ghir stood motionless. Abruptly his huge hand tightened on the drinking-horn, and it shattered.</p>
    <p>His hair-fringed mouth gaped open in agony. Only a choking snarl rasped out.</p>
    <p>"But no man sees his own doom in the falling of the rose. ..."</p>
    <p>The chieftain's body arched back. He clawed at his throat, his contorted face blindly upturned. Then he crashed down, as a tree falls, and lay silent on a dirty bear fur. A single shudder shook the gross form, before Dro-Ghir was utterly still.</p>
    <p>Ardath caught his breath.</p>
    <p>His glance probed the Oriental's sharp black eyes as Li Yang stood up hurriedly.</p>
    <p>"We must go before Dro-Ghir's body is found. Most of the men are in a drunken stupor, as always after a victory. Hurry!"</p>
    <p>"Wait," Ardath protested. "I do not understand."</p>
    <p>The Oriental's bland face was immobile, but his black eyes twinkled with malicious amusement.</p>
    <p>"Dro-Ghir signaled me to give you the poisoned cup. I gave him the deadly wine, instead. Listen, Ardath--that is your name, I think. Your words were not for this barbarian chief. Ever since Dro-Ghir captured me, years ago, I have served him with my wisdom. He spared me because I gave him good counsel."</p>
    <p>Ardath's eyes widened, startled by the simple explanation. Li Yang had been the power behind Dro-Ghir's throne.</p>
    <p>The Oriental was the genius who had inspired the invader!</p>
    <p>"I am tired of being a slave," said Li Yang frankly. "Eventually Dro-Ghir would have doubted my wisdom, and would have slain me. Also, I do not like this savage world. Let me go with you, Ardath, into the future"--he glanced at the grease-stained furs--"where, at least, there may be more comfortable couches."</p>
    <p>Involuntarily Ardath's solemn face relaxed in a gentle smile. He could not help liking this blandly frank Oriental, who played soft music with one hand while he administered poison with the other.</p>
    <p>"Very well," he agreed. "Let us go. What of the guards-- can we pass through their lines?"</p>
    <p>"Unless Dro-Ghir's body is discovered. In that case, not even I will be above suspicion, so we must hurry."</p>
    <p>The two slipped quietly from the tent and under a swollen red moon they walked through the encampment. Only when the fires had grown dim behind them did they breathe freely once more.</p>
    <p>Li Yang pointed up to the smoke from the camp that drifted across Earth's satellite.</p>
    <p>"Barbarian flames darken the Moon-lantern," he said softly. In future ages, the smoke may have drifted away. Not for many centuries, though, I think!"</p>
    <p>Ardath did not answer, for he was concentrating on the brain of the man who walked beside him. Presently he sighed with an emotion that was close to despair.</p>
    <p>His quest was not over. Li Yang was wise, far ahead of his time in intelligence, but he was not the super-being Ardath sought. The search must still go on through the eons. But Li Yang would be a good companion to have, despite his shortcomings.</p>
    <p>After awhile, they came in sight of the ship.</p>
    <p>The Oriental's lips quivered, though his face remained immobile.</p>
    <p>"The chariot actually flies?" he asked in awe. "It is truly wonderful, like the fabled dragon of Sti-Shan."</p>
    <p>On the threshold of the golden ship, Ardath paused a moment. His gaze went to the blue curtain that flickered across the laboratory door. Then he looked sharply at Thordred and Jansaiya, who were rising from their couches.</p>
    <p>Jansaiya's elfin features betrayed nothing, though there was a hint of fear in the sea-green eyes. Thordred's beard bristled with apparent indignation.</p>
    <p>"It is time you returned!" he growled. "Look!" He pointed toward the laboratory. Silently Ardath entered, Li Yang at his heels. Ignoring their apparent interest in the Oriental, he lifted his brows in a question.</p>
    <p>"Enemies," Thordred grunted, his yellow eyes angry. "They came from the forest. I--" He looked away involuntarily. "I opened the 'door, which was wrong, I admit. But I was curious--"</p>
    <p>"Go on," Ardath ordered unemotionally.</p>
    <p>"Well, the barbarians saw us. They came toward the ship, yelling and hurling spears. I shut the port and barred it, but they hammered so hard on the metal I feared they'd break through."</p>
    <p>"No spear can pierce the hull," Ardath replied quietly.</p>
    <p>"Jansaiya was frightened, and I was weaponless. I thought I could find a weapon in your laboratory. But when I tried to enter--" He made a quick, angry gesture toward the threshold. "You do not trust us, I see."</p>
    <p>"You are wrong." Ardath smiled suddenly. "I take precautions against possible enemies, but you are not my enemy, Thordred. The barbarians fled?"</p>
    <p>"They gave up at last," Thordred blurted hurriedly. "But if they had broken in, we would have been slaughtered like trapped beasts."</p>
    <p>Ardath shrugged indifferently.</p>
    <p>"It should be forgotten. We have a new companion. And soon we must sleep again for centuries."</p>
    <p>Thordred said nothing. His eyes were veiled, but slow rage mounted within him. Again he had failed. Not completely, though--He had not betrayed himself, and as yet Ardath suspected nothing.</p>
    <p>They must sleep again, yet they would awaken.</p>
    <p>Thordred's fist clenched. The next time, he would not fail!</p>

     <p>The Living Death</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Stephen Court was in his Wisconsin laboratory-home. With Marion and Sammy, he had returned from Canada and plunged immediately into a desperate succession of experiments. Slowly, painfully, he made progress.</p>
    <p>"We have two goals," he told Marion, his dark eyes gleaming behind lids that were red with lack of sleep. "First--"</p>
    <p>"First you've got to eat something," the girl interrupted.</p>
    <p>She brought a tray to Court's desk and set it down. Silently he nodded his thanks. Wolfing a sandwich without tasting it, he kept on talking.</p>
    <p>"Remember what I told you about seeing a golden space ship on an orbit around the Earth? I've been checking that. I have a hunch there's some clue connected with that ship."</p>
    <p>"How do you figure that out?"</p>
    <p>Marion perched on a corner of the desk, her trim legs swinging under the lab smock she wore.</p>
    <p>"The ship was obviously created by some civilization far in advance of ours. That means their science was also in advance of today's. Perhaps in that vessel I can find some weapon--some method unknown to modern science--that will help me fight the plague. The very least it can do is set me on the right track."</p>
    <p>Marion patted her dark hair into place, though she boasted that she had lost all the silly feminine habits.</p>
    <p>How can you reach the ship? Space travel is impossible."</p>
    <p>Court smiled. "It was impossible. Rockets are useless as yet, because the fuel problem's insurmountable. Balloons weren't practical. But there is a way of overcoming gravitation.</p>
    <p>"Good Lord!" The girl slid down from the desk and stood staring. "You don't mean--"</p>
    <p>"Hold on. I haven't done anything yet, except make some spectroscopic analyses. Marion, that space ship isn't made of gold! It's a yellow metal, an unknown alloy. I haven't finished analyzing it, but I know there's magnesium there, tungsten, and other elements. The virtue of that alloy is that, properly magnetized, it becomes resistant to gravitation."</p>
    <p>"How?" she asked, amazed.</p>
    <p>Court tapped idly on the tray as he replied.</p>
    <p>"I'm just theorizing, though I feel pretty certain. Earth is a gigantic magnet. You know that. Well, like poles repel, opposite poles attract. If we could set up a magnetic force absolutely identical to Earth's, we could utilize that principle. So far it hasn't been done, except by the unknowns who built that golden ship. If I can duplicate the alloy--which I think I can do--and shoot the right sort of energy into it, we'll have a space ship."</p>
    <p>"Whew!" Marion breathed, and she blinked. "Then you'll go out after--"</p>
    <p>"The golden vessel? Yes. It may be a wild goose chase, for all I know, but the chance is worth taking. I may find scientific knowledge that will be just what I need."</p>
    <p>The girl turned away with such haste that Court looked at her sharply.</p>
    <p>"What is it?" he demanded.</p>
    <p>She shook her head speechlessly. Court got up swiftly and swung her around to face him. There were tears in her lovely brown eyes.</p>
    <p>"Tell me what it is!" he commanded. "What's wrong?"</p>
    <p>She bit her lip. "You'll think I'm foolish."</p>
    <p>"I said, tell me what it is!"</p>
    <p>"I'm just superstitious," Marion burst out. "It isn't scientific at all. But for a minute I had the queerest feeling that-- that--"</p>
    <p>"Well?" he said impatiently, frowning and gripping her shoulders.</p>
    <p>"That there's danger in that ship," she whispered. "Danger to you, Stephen. As though that golden ship had been waiting for ages, perhaps--just for the moment when you'd enter it."</p>
    <p>He grinned ironically and sat down again. Gulping milk, he watched Marion laughingly over the rim of the glass.</p>
    <p>"A sort of ancient rendezvous," he teased. "You're under a nervous tension, Marion. We all are," he admitted, sobering. "And there's reason enough, I'm afraid."</p>
    <p>They fell painfully silent. Both were thinking of the man who lay alone in a lead-plated room upstairs. Sammy was already being ravaged by the frightful plague from outer space. Court got up, squaring his shoulders with decision.</p>
    <p>"He didn't back down, you know, and I certainly won't run from a shadow. Get my suit, Marion. It's time to check up on Sammy again."</p>
    <p>Nervously she helped Court don the armor.</p>
    <p>"There's something going on at the village," she said. "Not a--a shadow, either. Since the plague has hit the newspapers, the villagers are frightened."</p>
    <p>"Why?" Court asked, slipping on his gloves. "There's been only one case in this country as yet, and that was in Georgia. Europe, Africa, China? Sure. But--"</p>
    <p>"Somebody's been talking. They know about Sammy. They claim that you're exposing the whole village to deadly danger by keeping Sammy here."</p>
    <p>"Damned idiots!" He made an impatient gesture with his lead-gauntleted hand. "Sammy's completely isolated. There's no danger at all."</p>
    <p>"They're not scientists," she argued. "Just ordinary people, most of them fairly uneducated. But they've got families and--Well, I'm afraid."</p>
    <p>"The police can't touch me."</p>
    <p>"It's not that." Marion bit her lip and paused. Then she shrugged. "It doesn't matter, I suppose. But I hope nothing happens."</p>
    <p>"Nothing will," he assured her.</p>
    <p>He went out, hurrying through a long corridor to a lead-plated door. When he knocked, there was no response. Making sure there were no gaps in his armor, Court entered the experimental room.</p>
    <p>It was large, yet amazingly cluttered with apparatus. The lead walls dully reflected the dim light. On white-topped tables by the hospital bed lay gauges, indicators, and enigmatic looking devices.</p>
    <p>The figure on the bed was completely unrecognizable. The metamorphosis had come so swiftly that Sammy was horribly inhuman in appearance. His skin emitted a silvery radiance. His face was a mere bag of loosely wrinkled skin, hanging repulsively about the jutting nose. His mouth was invisible below eyes that were gleaming but blind.</p>
    <p>Court fought down the sick horror that tore at his stomach. He dared not give way to sentiment, nor even admit its existence. Before him was a test case, a laboratory subject. That was all. He must forget that he had ever known the old man, that the faithful regenerated tramp has been his only friend, his entire family. . . .</p>
    <p>"Hello, Sammy," he said in a voice that would not lose its choked quality. "How do you feel?"</p>
    <p>There was no motion perceptible in the shrunken body on the bed. But a remarkably clear voice murmured a reply.</p>
    <p>"Hello, Stevie."</p>
    <p>"Any change?"</p>
    <p>"None. I'm just hungry."</p>
    <p>Court took a rabbit from a lead-lined box beside the bed, and placed it gently in the malformed talons that once had been Sammy's hand. Instantly there was a change. The small beast kicked convulsively and was still. The glow emanating from Sammy's skin brightened slightly.</p>
    <p>"That better?"</p>
    <p>"Yes. Thanks, Stevie."</p>
    <p>Court drew up a chair and clumsily sat down in it. Through the lead-infiltrated goggles, his eyes probed. With gloved fingers he made adjustments on the apparatus, and carefully checked the readings on certain gauges.</p>
    <p>"The change is progressive," he muttered under his breath.</p>
    <p>Drawing a microscope toward him, he took a sample of the patient's skin cells and prepared a slide.</p>
    <p>"Yes, entropy . . . Incredible! I still can't understand--"</p>
    <p>"What is it, Steve?" Sammy asked weakly.</p>
    <p>"Nothing new. But I'll find a cure yet. You can depend on me, Sammy."</p>
    <p>The hideous folds of wrinkles twitched in a ghastly semblance of amusement.</p>
    <p>'Tour cure won't help me. I'm hungry again."</p>
    <p>Court gave the old man another rabbit. Then he took pencil and paper, set a stop-watch on the table, and began the usual word-association test. Though simple, it had proved surprisingly effective in checking on the patient's mental metamorphosis.</p>
    <p>But now Court was due for a surprise. The test proceeded normally, Sammy responding without much hesitation, though over two words--"man" and "We"--he paused perceptibly. Then Court said, "Food," and immediately Sammy responded, "Human."</p>
    <p>Court made a great effort to control himself. He read the next word, and the next, but he did not even hear Sammy's responses. He was battling down the gorge that rose in his throat, yet this should have been expected. Sammy was absorbing life-energy from living beings, and the human brain contained the highest form of such energy. But what would be the result?</p>
    <p>Sammy's replies lagged as he seemed to grow weaker. Court left him at last, with a few encouraging words. But when he hurried out, he was feeling worried and depressed.</p>
    <p>It was past sunset, and he switched on the light in his lab. Removing the lead-armor, he sat down to think matters over. Sammy was no longer entirely human, for the change was progressing rapidly. His basal metabolism was tremendously increased. As Court had discovered, the very matter of his body was changed.</p>
    <p>"Entropy," he whispered, nervously folding and unfolding his hands. "That's the answer, of course. But what it means--"</p>
    <p>Entropy, the rate of the Universe's running down. A human body is composed of atoms and electrons, like a universe. If the entropic value of a life-organism is increased, what is the result?</p>
    <p>Court was angry with himself because he did not know. He should have been grateful for not being able to see the future. . . .</p>
    <p>"Sammy's changing into another form of life, that's certain. And he absorbs energy directly through contact. I must take more precautions. He may be dangerous later."</p>
    <p>Abruptly there was an interruption. The door flew open, and Marion burst in. Her brown hair was in disorder under her white cap.</p>
    <p>"Stephen!" she cried through pallid lips. "There are men coming up the road!"</p>
    <p>"What about it?" he asked, without interest.</p>
    <p>"From the village. With torches. I'm afraid--"</p>
    <p>"Those damned fools!" he snapped angrily. "Rouse out the men. Give them rifles. Tell them to spread through the house and keep its front covered from inside. When I give the word, they can fire."</p>
    <p>Marion stared at him in horror.</p>
    <p>"You'd--murder those men?"</p>
    <p>Court's eyes were icy as he returned her stricken gaze.</p>
    <p>"Why not? They're afraid I have a contagious case here.</p>
    <p>But they're afraid for their own precious skins. They'd be willing to burn down the house and kill Sammy. Well, it's lucky I've taken precautions. Do what I say!"</p>
    <p>His tone sent Marion racing out.</p>
    <p>Growling an oath, Court went to the front door. He opened it and stepped out on the front porch. A bright moon revealed the scene. Before him the road sloped steeply down to the village, with a few trees that were blots of shadow on either side.</p>
    <p>Torches flamed along the road. Twenty-five or thirty men --possibly more--were advancing in ominous silence.</p>
    <p>Court put his back against the door and waited. The ignorant fools! He was trying to save their lives.</p>
    <p>Quickly the mob formed a crescent about the porch. They were mostly villagers and farmers. Under other circumstances, they-would have dreamed and worked away their lives without ever embarking on such a hazardous venture as this. But now their work-worn faces were grim, and their sharp eyes narrowed with deadly purpose.</p>
    <p>Court unfolded his arms. Though he held no weapon, the mob drew back slightly. Then one man, a lean, grizzle-haired oldster in overalls, stepped forward.</p>
    <p>"What do you want?" Court asked quietly.</p>
    <p>The old man scowled.</p>
    <p>"We want some questions answered, Mr. Court. Are you harborin' a case of the Plague?"</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>The word was flatly emotionless, yet a mutter went up from the crowd.</p>
    <p>"I s'pose you know that's contagious. There can't nothin' stop it."</p>
    <p>There is no danger of contagion," Court replied. "I have taken care of that." He gestured at the flickering flames of the torches. "What do you wish to do--kill my patient?"</p>
    <p>"Nope," the spokesman stated. "We want you to send him away from here, to a hospital. The papers say there ain't no way of stopping the Plague. I got two kids myself, Mr. Court. The rest of us, we're family men. How'd you like it if--"</p>
    <p>"I tell you, there's no danger," Court snapped. His nerves, already tense with overwork and sleeplessness, were frayed beyond endurance. "Get outÂ" all of you, or you'll regret it!"</p>
    <p>An ominous low roar went up from the mob. They surged forward, paused only when Court lifted his hand.</p>
    <p>"Wait! I have a dozen men in the house, stationed at the windows, with guns aimed at you right now. Submachine-guns, some of them, and rifles. We can protect ourselves from lynch law."</p>
    <p>The crowd wavered uncertainly. The oldster yelled a shrill protest. "We ain't lynchers, Mr. Court We're just aimin' to protect our folks. We got a car down the road a bit, and we aim to take your Plague victim to a hospital." Court laughed ironically.</p>
    <p>"You poor idiot! You just said the Plague is contagious."</p>
    <p>"Sure it is. But we got rubber gloves, and cotton pads soaked in antiseptic to tie over our mouths, and we'll wash in carbolic afterward. We just don't want our folks to run any risks."</p>
    <p>"Rubber gloves!" Court snorted. "Only thick lead can protect you from the Plague. If you won't leave instantly, we'll use guns to convince you. And I warn you, I won't hesitate to do that if it's necessary."</p>
    <p>"He ain't bluffing," one of the mob said nervously. "I saw a muzzle up there in that winder."</p>
    <p>"Don't worry about it," the spokesman said. "We're comin' in, Mr. Court, unless you bring the man out to us."</p>
    <p>As the crowd surged forward, Court raised his pistol and took steady aim at the leader.</p>
    <p>"You set foot on the first step," he gritted, "and I'll put a bullet through your head."</p>
    <p>The old man walked slowly, quietly, up the steps. Behind him came the others. Court's finger tightened on the trigger, yet he did not fire.</p>
    <p>His face grew terrible at the conflict that raged within him. Stephen Court--man of ice and iron--torn by puerile emotion? Shoot! That was the logical thing to do. Shoot, to save Sammy, to save the experiment from these ignorant fools.</p>
    <p>But the mob did not want to kill. Court knew that they were honest, hard-working men, who loved their families and wanted to protect them from danger.</p>
    <p>The nearest was only a few steps from him. But Court did not fire, nor give the word that would have brought a searing blast from the upper windows. His lips twisted in agonized indecision.</p>
    <p>From within the house came a scream. The door flung open and Marion Barton fled out, her face chalk-white. "Stephen! Quick!"</p>
    <p>Court whirled, ignoring the besiegers. "What is it?"</p>
    <p>"Sammy came into the lab! He was--"</p>
    <p>A startled gasp came from the old man. He drew back, staring. A rippling wave of fear shook the crowd that had shuffled to the porch. With one arm around Marion, Court dragged her back. Just then, something came out of the door.</p>
    <p>He knew it was Sammy. But the metamorphosis had been incredibly accelerated. Sammy was not even as human as he had been half an hour before.</p>
    <p>His body could not be seen. A white shadow, with flickering nimbus edges, paused on the threshold. The pallid glow emanating from Sammy's flesh had become so brilliant that its lambent light entirely hid the frightful body.</p>
    <p>Staring at him was like looking into the heart of an electric-light bulb, though the illumination was not strong enough to be blinding.</p>
    <p>A shining, roughly man-shaped shadow, it stood on the threshold. And it whispered! A vague, wordless susurrus murmured out. Like the hum emitted by some electric contrivance, it was enigmatic and unhuman.</p>
    <p>The shadow lurched forward. Its shimmering arms went around the old man in overalls. The spokesman shrieked as though the soul had been wrenched from his body. Then he fell, his body oddly shrunken, pale and lifeless.</p>
    <p>Panic struck the mob. In all directions they fled back. The thing that had been Sammy seemed to glide down the steps in pursuit.</p>
    <p>"Oh, my God!" Court whispered. His face was drawn with pain as he slowly took aim with his pistol. "Sammy--"</p>
    <p>He did not finish. The shot snarled out in the night.</p>
    <p>The glowing bulk was unharmed. With his breath catching in his throat, Court pumped bullet after bullet at it. It stumbled down the lawn, while the mob vanished along the slope.</p>
    <p>"No use!" Court gritted between his teeth. "It absorbs every kind of energy, including kinetic."</p>
    <p>He let out a shout. Glancing up, he pointed. From the windows above him came a burst of sound. Submachine-guns and rifles rattled lethally, concentrating their fire on the shining horror that moved into the night.</p>
    <p>It vanished behind a tree and was gone. Marion gripped Court's arm.</p>
    <p>"Poor Sammy! Can't we go after him?"</p>
    <p>"That isn't Sammy," Court said grimly. "Not now. It--it's a horror, an alien thing out of another universe, perhaps. Yes, I'm going after it, Marion, but not till I've put on my lead suit. I'm not sure I can capture it, even then." He blew across the smoking muzzle of his gun. "A creature whose touch means instant death is loose in the countryside. And I don't even know if it can be killed!"</p>

     <p>CHAPTER XI.</p>
     <p>The Man from Carthage</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Scipio Agricola Africanus sat in a dungeon beneath the circus arena. Through a barred grating, he watched one gladiator disembowel another. The stroke, he thought, was clean and good for the men from Gaul were like wolves, dark, feral and quick. Scipio rather hoped he would be matched against them, rather than against lions or an elephant. There was something about the feel of steel matched against your own sword that put heart into a man.</p>
    <p>An armored guard, coming along the corridor, pushed open the door of Scipio's cell. His hawk face peered in.</p>
    <p>"Your turn soon," he said.</p>
    <p>"Good," replied Scipio, with a pleasant oath. "I grow tired of battling fleas."</p>
    <p>The soldier chuckled as he bent to adjust a greave.</p>
    <p>"By my Lares, you have courage! Too bad your dream failed. I would not have objected to serving under such a man as you."</p>
    <p>"I failed because none of my men had the courage of a rabbit," Scipio spat in disgust. "Faith, we could have taken Carthage almost without bloodshed."</p>
    <p>"Had your army not fled, leaving you to face the Imperial Guard alone!" The soldier shook his head, grinning wryly. "Nothing but trouble since you came to Africa, Scipio. It was bad enough with those damned Romans yelling that Carthage must be destroyed, but at least they had not tried to destroy it. And what did you do?"</p>
    <p>Scipio's eyes lighted. He was a huge, swarthy man, with the scarred face of a gargoyle. His nose had been broken so often that it sprawled shapelessly awry. Atop that monstrous face, the ringlets of short, curly black hair were incongruous.</p>
    <p>"What did I do?" the adventurer asked. "Faith, I tried to serve your king, but he would not let me."</p>
    <p>The guard choked and spluttered his outrage.</p>
    <p>"Jupiter! You got drunk and dragged the king off to some low gambling hell. No wonder you had to flee to the mountains after that! Then you got some insane idea about creating an independent city of your own. That might have worked, if you had gone far enough into the Nubian country with your followers. But you decided to take Carthage. Carthage!"</p>
    <p>The soldier made an infuriating roar of merriment.</p>
    <p>"Come within the reach of my manacled hands," Scipio invited pleasantly, "and I'll tear off your head with considerable joy."</p>
    <p>"Save that for the arena," said the soldier, moving back slightly. "Tonight the cries will announce that the Carthaginian Scipio is no more. Only, you are not a man of Carthage, come to think of it. Are you?"</p>
    <p>"Why not?" The giant captive shrugged. "Rome is a melting pot. The blood of a dozen races mix in my veins. I am a citizen of Carthage now, at least for awhile. By the way, how do I die?"</p>
    <p>"Elephant. They have a huge tusker whom they've driven musth with rage and hunger. You are to face him on equal terms, both of you unarmed." He glanced cautiously over his shoulder. "I am to accompany you to the arena gate. And if you happen to seize my sword and take it with you--Well, such things have happened."</p>
    <p>Scipio nodded. "Too bad you're not carrying a lance. However a sword must do. I can spill the behemoth's blood before it tramples me. Thanks, soldier. If you let me escape now, I'll make you a prince of the nation I intend to establish."</p>
    <p>"Listen to the lunatic," the guard said, with rapt admiration. "In chains, penniless, and offering to make me a prince! A prince of dreams, mayhap. Anyway, my vows are to Caesar, and not the Roman Imperator, either. So you must remain a captive."</p>
    <p>The filthy straw rustled under Scipio as he shrugged. A death-cry drifted in from the arena, then the triumphant roar of some ferocious beast.</p>
    <p>"Well," said the soldier, "your time has come."</p>
    <p>"I wonder." There was a curious look in Scipio's deep-set eyes. "Lately I have had a queer feeling, as though the gods were watching me. Perhaps. . . ."</p>
    <p>He did not finish. More guards came, and the Carthaginian was unfettered and escorted along an underground corridor. Almost naked, his brawny body gleamed like mahogany in the sharp contrasts of light and shadow that filtered in through bars. Then the arena opened before them. Scipio was thrust forward. He saw at his side the friendly soldier, turned so that his sword-hilt was exposed.</p>
    <p>With a grin and quick movement, Scipio clutched the weapon and whipped it out. Before the startled guards could move, he ran forward into the hot sands of the arena. The soles of his feet burned, then cooled as he halted in a patch of reddened sand.</p>
    <p>The blazing African sun flooded down in blinding whiteness. Scipio had only a vague impression of the crowd that filled the circus. He could pick out no individuals. He felt as though one vast entity, surging, whispering, watching, surrounded him, and the head of the entity was the canopied box of the Lord of Carthage.</p>
    <p>Scipio shifted his grip on the sword. He brushed the curly hair from his eyes with one hand, and stood warily on the balls of his feet. A musth elephant, eh? Well, no man could resist such an enemy, yet a man could die fighting.</p>
    <p>"Alas for my dreams of empire," the Carthaginian murmured, with a crookedly sardonic smile. "Faith, I might have ruled the world, given time. And now I must water the sand with my blood."</p>
    <p>He turned to the Imperial box, lifting his hand in salute. The emperor nodded, expecting to hear the usual, "We who are about to die--" of the gladiators.</p>
    <p>Scipio disappointed his host. At the top of his voice he howled the words that would most enrage the onlookers.</p>
    <p>"Carthage must be destroyed!"</p>
    <p>A wave of fury, a gasp of astonishment and rage, rippled around the arena. The emperor make a quick, angry gesture. Grinning, Scipio turned to see a barred gate far across the sanded arena rise slowly.</p>
    <p>For a few heartbeats there was silence throughout the circus. The blinding white heat was oppressive. Steam curled up from the blood-stains on the sands.</p>
    <p>Then the musth elephant pounded to the gate. Huge, monstrous, a gray, walking vastness of animated dull savagery, he lurched through the gate and stood motionless, only his bloodshot little eyes alive with hatred. The trunk did not move, save for the tip, which swayed back and forth slightly.</p>
    <p>A shadow darkened the arena as a cloud crossed the Sun, and then was gone.</p>
    <p>Scipio hefted the sword he held. It was a short-bladed weapon, useless unless he could hurl it like a javelin. It was even too broad to pierce an elephant's eye, the most vulnerable spot of the monster. Briefly Scipio thought of slicing off the elephant's trunk as far up as he could reach. But that would still leave the tusks and mighty tree-trunk limbs that could squash a man into red pulp.</p>
    <p>"Well," Scipio said with grim amusement, "at least they had to use their biggest elephant to kill me."</p>
    <p>His gargoyle face twisted into a fearless grin. In the glaring tight, he resembled a teakwood statue, thewed like a colossus.</p>
    <p>The elephant came forward slowly, its red eyes questing viciously until it saw Scipio. It paused, and the trunk lifted, waving snakelike in the air. It snorted angrily.</p>
    <p>Again the shadow darkened the Sun, and this time it did not pass.</p>
    <p>The Carthaginian had no time to look up. He bent slightly from the knees, holding the sword high like a javelin.</p>
    <p>The elephant broke into a lumbering trot. Its speed increased. Like the Juggernaut, it bore down on him. . . .</p>
    <p>Scipio had a flashing glimpse of the monster--flapping ears, murderously upheld trunk, gleaming tusks. The thunder of its approach was growing louder, booming in his ears. It loomed above him--</p>
    <p>From the skies sprang a thunderbolt! Flaming with pale brilliance, the crackling beam raved down. It caught the behemoth in mid-stride, bathed it in shining radiance. And the monster vanished!</p>
    <p>It was gone without a trace. The deep craters of its rush ended in the sand a few yards from where the shocked Scipio crouched. From the spectators rose a roar, terrified, unbelieving.</p>
    <p>A golden ball of enormous size plunged down into the arena. Lightly as a feather it grounded. A port in its hull sprang open.</p>
    <p>Scipio saw a thin, pallid man, with the ascetic face of a Caesar. He was clad in odd garments and was beckoning urgently. Beyond him, Scipio glimpsed a fat Chinese whose round cheeks were quivering with excitement.</p>
    <p>A spear flashed through the air, rang impotently against the golden hull. Almost paralyzed with amazement, Scipio ran forward, leaped into the ship. What this miracle might be, he did not know, but it seemed to provide a means of escape. Whether the pallid man was a god or a devil, at least he seemed friendly. More important, to remain in the arena meant death.</p>
    <p>The port slammed shut behind Scipio. He bounded through the inner lock and stood wide-legged, staring around. The sword was still gripped in his hand. Past him the pallid man strode, and entered an inner chamber. A quiver of movement shook the ship as it lifted. The Oriental waddled into view and beamed at Scipio.</p>
    <p>"Relax, friend," he said, lisping the unfamiliar tongue. "You speak Latin?"</p>
    <p>"Naturally," Scipio stated. "All the world does. Are you a god? I doubt it, for only Bacchus and Silenus are obese, and their skins are not yellow."</p>
    <p>The Oriental shook with laughter until he had to hold his heaving belly.</p>
    <p>"I have heard of this Bacchus. A new god, but he is a good one. Sit down." He waved toward a couch. "My name is Li Yang. Do you wish food?"</p>
    <p>Scipio shook his head and sat gingerly on the soft cushions.</p>
    <p>"You called me friend?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"I might better have called you comrade. Ardath saw the hidden possibilities in you, dragon-face. He read your mind while you slept. Ah, but you have dreams of empire, poor fool!"</p>
    <p>Li Yang shook his head, and his yellow cheeks swung pendulously.</p>
    <p>"Ill-luck dogs me," Scipio said lightly, grinning. "The gods hate me, so I wear no crown."</p>
    <p>"Nor will you. You are not ruthless enough. You could carve out an empire for yourself, but you could not sit upon a throne. Under all thrones the snake coils. You are too honest to be a kink, Scipio."</p>
    <p>The Carthaginian had been about to answer, but he paused. His dark eyes widened, and a flame sprang into them. Ponderously Li Yang turned.</p>
    <p>Two figures stood on the threshold. One was Thordred, but Scipio had no eyes for even that gigantic form. He was staring with a burning fixity at the Atlantean priestess.</p>
    <p>She looked lovely indeed. Her delicate figure was veiled by a girdled robe, from the hem of which her tiny toes peeped. Her golden hair hung loosely about her shoulders, and framed the elfin features that showed interested admiration.</p>
    <p>"Jove's thunderbolt!" Scipio gasped. "Nay, but this is a goddess! This is Venus herself!"</p>
    <p>Jansaiya preened herself. Under her lashes the sea-green eyes watched Scipio slumbrously. She basked in the frank, open gaze.</p>
    <p>"This is Scipio?" the priestess asked.</p>
    <p>She came forward and put a small, shapely hand on the Carthaginian's brawny arm. He looked down at her, his gargoyle face alight with wonder.</p>
    <p>"You know me? But who are you?"</p>
    <p>"Jansaiya." The girl glanced over her shoulder. "And this is Thordred."</p>
    <p>Scipio saw the giant for the first time, apparently. His gaze met and locked with Thordred's smoldering glare. The two men stood silent. Scipio did not notice when Jansaiya took her hand from his arm.</p>
    <p>Li Yang's red lips pursed as he glanced from one to the other.</p>
    <p>It was a sight worth seeing. Thordred was huge, elephant-thewed, hairy as a beast, with jutting beard and aquiline, handsome, features.</p>
    <p>Scipio, though slightly shorter, was almost as huge. His gargoyle face grew stone-hard. Thordred's cat's-eyes glittered. A silent enmity flamed in those glares that met without speech.</p>
    <p>Ardath broke the deadlock by coming out of the laboratory.</p>
    <p>"We are moving out toward our orbit," he said, smiling. "Soon it will be time to sleep again. Perhaps next time . . ." He sighed. "Meanwhile, though Scipio is not the super-mentality I need, he is a genius in his way. Let me explain, warrior."</p>
    <p>Scipio nodded from time to time as Ardath told his story. The Carthaginian's quick brain grasped the situation without difficulty.</p>
    <p>"You will come with us?" Ardath asked at last.</p>
    <p>"Why not?" Scipio replied, shrugging. "The world is not ready for such a man as I. In later ages, countries will recognize my worth and kneel at my feet." The granite face cracked into a grin, and he glanced at Jansaiya. "Besides, I shall be in good company. To how many men is it given to know a goddess?"</p>
    <p>Thordred growled under his breath while Li Yang chuckled. The fat Oriental picked up his lute and strummed softly upon it. His voice raised mellowly.</p>
    <p>"My love has come down from the Moon-lantern. In the heart of the lotus she dwells. . . ."</p>
    <p>"And now--" Ardath turned toward the laboratory. "I must adjust my controls. We shall automatically fall into our orbit. For two thousand years we shall sleep, and then revisit the Earth."</p>
    <p>He vanished into the next room.</p>
    <p>"Fragrant are her hands as petals," Li Yang sang. "In her hair the stars dance."</p>
    <p>Jansaiya smiled. Scipio grinned a silent, confident reply to Thordred's dark scowl.</p>
    <p>Humming power throbbed through the ship, swiftly grew louder. Li Yang clambered awkwardly on a couch, gesturing for Scipio to follow his example. Sleep poured from the monotonous sound. Idly Li Yang touched the strings of his lute.</p>
    <p>"Give me sweet dreams, dear goddess," he murmured.</p>
    <p>Jansaiya reclined on a couch. When Scipio turned his head to watch her, her green eyes met his.</p>
    <p>Thordred moved stiffly forward. His hand was hidden from view behind him as he stood beside the laboratory door.</p>
    <p>The languorous humming grew louder, more compelling. Jansaiya slept. Li Yang's pudgy hand fell from the lute. Scipio's eyelids drooped.</p>
    <p>Footsteps sounded softly. Through the doorway came Ardath, smiling his gentle smile. Perhaps he was dreaming that when he awoke, he would find his quest at an end. Not noticing Thordred beside him, he turned and fumbled over the wall with rapidly slowing fingers.</p>
    <p>The skin around Thordred's eyes wrinkled as he fought to remain awake. His hand came up with the slow motion of encroaching torpor, and he gripped a heavy metal bludgeon.</p>
    <p>He crashed it down on Ardath's head.</p>
    <p>Without a sound, the Kyrian crumpled and fell, lay utterly motionless. Blood seeped slowly through his dark hair.</p>
    <p>Instantly Thordred lunged through the doorway and reeled toward an instrument panel. If he could throw a single switch, the sleep-inducing apparatus would be shut off--</p>
    <p>Louder the humming grew. Its vibration shuddered through every atom of Thordred's body. In the next room was absolute silence.</p>
    <p>Thordred fell without feeling that he was doing so. The shock awakened him. He dragged himself to his knees and crawled on, his hand clawing desperately.</p>
    <p>One finger touched the switch and helplessly slipped down. The giant Earthman crouched, shaking his head slowly.</p>
    <p>Then he collapsed and sprawled out, silent. The yellow eyes were filmed with cataleptic sleep.</p>
    <p>The humming rose to a peak that gradually began to die away. Inside the golden ship, nothing stirred when it reached its orbit and robot controls made swift adjustments. Around the Earth the vessel hurtled.</p>
    <p>The lute fell from Li Yang's couch. A string snapped. . . .</p>

    <p>Stephen Court raced his roadster along a Wisconsin road as he peered through sun-glasses at the lonely countryside. Beside him, Marion Barton huddled like a kitten in the seat, the collar of her white blouse open for coolness.</p>
    <p>"How long?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"Couple of hours," Court grunted. "We pass through Madison first. The 'drome's fifty miles south of there."</p>
    <p>Marion drew a notebook from her purse and thumbed through it rapidly.</p>
    <p>"Everything's checked, I think," she reported absently. "Except the test flight. I don't believe the Temra was thoroughly inspected."</p>
    <p>"Damn silly name the papers gave the ship," Court said wryly. "It didn't need a name. It'll make the flight, all right."</p>
    <p>"And if it doesn't?"</p>
    <p>He shrugged indifferently without glancing at her.</p>
    <p>"Nothing much lost. For more than a month now, I've been working on the Plague--since Sammy got away--and I'm still at sea. Earth's science just isn't advanced enough. But perhaps I can find some more advanced alien science in that golden ship. Anyhow, we'll see."</p>
    <p>"Why must you go alone?" she insisted, her voice not quite steady.</p>
    <p>"Because there's only room for one. We can't take chances. There will be little enough air and supplies as it is. I'm the best man for the job, so I'm the one to go.'</p>
    <p>"But suppose something happens!"</p>
    <p>"I can't stop the Plague by myself. X is still unknown, as far as I'm concerned. The only real clue so far is entropy. I know that X is catalyzed by some element in Earth's atmosphere. It speeds up the entropy of a living organism, changes it into some form of life that might exist, normally, a billion years from now. But it's so alien!"</p>
    <p>He switched on the radio. A news commentator was talking excitedly.</p>
    <p>"Around Pittsburgh, martial law has been declared. W. P. A. workers are blasting out a deep trench around the city, and pouring deadly acids into it. Whether this will form an effective barrier, no one knows. The rivers are filled with floating corpses. The contagion is spreading with great speed. Nearly a hundred of the Carriers have been seen in Pittsburgh, and the bridges are choked with refugees. . . ."</p>
    <p>So there were still more of the shining monsters. Sammy had been one of the first, and he was still wandering at large, since nothing could capture or destroy him.</p>
    <p>"The Carriers kill instantly by touching their victims. Lead-plated suits are being issued to the guardsmen, but these do not always work. It depends on the quantity of energy emitted by a Carrier. Dynamite has been placed at the New York bridges and tubes. The mayor is ready to isolate Manhattan, if necessary, for protection.</p>
    <p>"The war is at a standstill. Troops are mutinying by the thousands. Every metropolis is being vacated. We estimate about three thousand Carriers now exist, widely scattered over the Earth. From Buenos Aires--"</p>
    <p>With an impatient gesture, Court shut off the radio.</p>
    <p>"No hope," he said. "The Plague is steadily on the increase. I must get to the golden ship and back as soon as possible."</p>
    <p>They sat in silent despair as the car swept along the deserted highways. The landscape was incongruously peaceful. The green, rolling hills of Wisconsin stretched around them. A broad, lazy river flowed quietly beside the road. The only sound in the stillness was the humming of the motor.</p>
    <p>Marion leaned her head back and stared up at the cloudless blue sky. All she could do now was let her thoughts drift. Suppose the Plague had never come to Earth. She and Stephen might be driving along together, under this same sky, and perhaps--</p>
    <p>She blinked out of her reverie and lit a cigarette with unsteady fingers.</p>
    <p>"Thanks," Court said, and took it gently from her.</p>
    <p>She lit another for herself.</p>
    <p>"Funny," she said.</p>
    <p>Court nodded grimly, staring ahead.</p>
    <p>"Yes, I know. All this changing--'Giving place to the new.' But God knows what the new order will be. A world peopled by beings of pure energy, eventually consuming all then-natural food, and dying off. Then there will be only a dead planet."</p>
    <p>"Will it still be as lovely?" she asked softly.</p>
    <p>"Lovely?" Court frowned, seemed to notice the landscape for the first time. His gaze swept out over the rolling hills and the placid river. "Yes," he said finally, in a curious voice, "it is rather lovely. I wasn't aware of it before."</p>
    <p>"I didn't think you ever would be," she said.</p>
    <p>He flushed. "I have had so little time--"</p>
    <p>"It wasn't that. You never looked at the world or at human beings. You looked through microscopes and telescopes."</p>
    <p>He glanced at the girl and his hand went out in a gesture that was somehow pathetic. Then his lips tightened. He drew back, again clutching the wheel firmly. He looked ahead grimly without speaking, not seeing the tears that hung on Marion's lashes.</p>
    <p>They reached the air field soon after. The Terra had been wheeled out. A shining, golden cylinder, eight feet in diameter and twenty feet long, its ends were slightly tapered and bluntly rounded. It gleamed in contrast to the rich black loam on which it lay.</p>
    <p>"Small," Court criticized, "But we had no time to make a larger one. It'll have to do."</p>
    <p>He helped Marion from the car and together they went toward the Terra. A group of mechanics and workers approached.</p>
    <p>"All set," the foreman stated. "She's warmed up and ready, Mr. Court."</p>
    <p>"Thanks." He halted at the open port. "Well. . . ."</p>
    <p>"Good luck," Marion breathed.</p>
    <p>Court stared at her. Curious lines that had never been there before now bracketed his mouth. He looked away at the green hillside, and then back at the girl. His lips parted involuntarily, but with an effort he controlled himself.</p>
    <p>"Thanks," he said. "Good-by, Marion. I--I'll see you soon." He entered the ship and closed the port behind him.</p>
    <p>Marion stood quite silent, her fingers blindly shredding her handkerchief to rags.</p>
    <p>The Terra rose smoothly, swiftly mounted straight up. Smaller and smaller it grew, a glittering nugget of gold against the blue sky. Then it was merely a speck--and it was gone.</p>
    <p>Marion turned and walked slowly back to the car. Her lips were bravely scarlet, yet they quivered against the pallor of her face.</p>
    <p>Court sat before the control panel, peering ahead through a porthole.</p>
    <p>"Wonder what effect radiation in space will have?" he murmured. "It's leaded polaroid glass, of course, but the other ship had no portholes at all. They probably used some sort of televisor equipment that's beyond our contemporary science."</p>
    <p>He could see nothing but the blue of the sky. It grew darker, shading to a deep purple. Faint stars began to twinkle, until countless points of light were glittering frostily.</p>
    <p>"Sinus, Jupiter, Mars." Court sighed.</p>
    <p>With the secret of space travel mastered, man could reach all the planets. With sufficient power, the interstellar gulfs might even be bridged. But how long would man continue to exist on Earth?</p>
    <p>Hours merged into an unending monotony of watchful, weary vigilance. The Terra plunged on, gathering speed.</p>
    <p>"Meteors might be a menace," Court mused, "unless the magnetic field deflects them. But that would work only on ferrous bodies. Still, nothing's happened so far." He changed his course slightly. "I'm doubtful about that space-armor. Spatial conditions can't be duplicated on Earth. Well, I've taken other precautions."</p>
    <p>He had had the door made to fit exactly the port that had been telescopically visible on the golden ship.</p>
    <p>A queer excitement grew stronger within Court as he neared his destination. He could not keep away from the transparent ports, for he was desperately anxious to see the golden ship. Some subtle instinct told him that the rendezvous might even be more important than he had realized.</p>
    <p>How long had the space ship maintained its orbit beyond the atmosphere? Whence had it come? What strange secrets might it hold?</p>
    <p>When Court found that his fingers were trembling slightly on the controls, he grimly repressed his nervousness. But he could not help wondering. Centuries--eons, perhaps--might have passed while the golden vessel circled the planet And now Stephen Court, man of Earth, was questing out to what destiny? He did not know, but some premonition of the incredible future must have come to him, for he shuddered.</p>
    <p>"Somebody's walked over my grave," he muttered, with a sardonic smile at the whimsy. "Well, it won't be long now."</p>
    <p>Again he turned to the port, and his breath caught in his throat.</p>
    <p>The golden ship hung there, a mysterious, gleaming cylinder against the star-bright background of black space. Swiftly it grew larger.</p>
    <p>As Court decelerated, his face was curiously pale. The Terra was easy to handle. He deftly pulled it alongside the other craft.</p>
    <p>Hull scraped against alloyed hull, till finally the two ports were flush together. Court threw a lever and hastily spun a wheel. He was breathing unevenly, and his eyes were glowing with excitement.</p>
    <p>The ships were held firmly together by an airtight rubberoid ring.</p>
    <p>He rose, donned a gas-mask, and picked up a revolver. Then he went to the port and gingerly swung it open. The air remained in the ship.</p>
    <p>Facing him was a surface of yellow metal, a scarcely visible crack showing that it was an oval door. Court pushed, but it did not yield. A blow torch might cut it, and certainly acids would bite through. But Court did not resort to these immediately. He fumbled with a powerful electromagnet and worked unavailingly for a time.</p>
    <p>At last, in desperation, he used acids to eat a small hole through the outer hull. The air that rushed out was thin and dead, but far from poisonous. Grunting, Court reached through the gap and managed to open the port.</p>
    <p>What he expected, he did not know. His nerves were strung to wire-edge, unbearably tense, now that he was face to face with the solution of the mystery. The port opened, and for a moment Court was weak with reaction.</p>
    <p>He saw nothing but a short corridor, about six feet long, featureless and vacant. Naturally there would be an airlock, for safety's sake. He should have expected one. At the farther end was another door, but this one had a lever set in it.</p>
    <p>Court walked forward and moved the lever slightly. The port swung open. Air gusted from the Terra to the golden ship. He stepped across the threshold and halted, staring around.</p>
    <p>He was in a good-sized room, apparently only one of several in this huge vessel. Open doorways gaped in the walls. The chamber was bare, with nothing but a few couches.</p>
    <p>But on the couches lay human beings!</p>
    <p>A gigantic gargoyle-faced man was naked, save for a clout, his bronzed body glistening in the dim illumination that came from no discernible source. Another man, Oriental, fat as a Buddha, sprawled untidily on a pile of cushions. On the floor beside him lay a lute with one broken string. And there was a girl. . . .</p>
    <p>An elfin creature with ivory skin, her lips curved into a tender smile, she slept with her golden hair partially veiling her face.</p>
    <p>On the floor near a doorway lay another figure, face down. Court crossed to it and turned it over. He stared at a slight form and chiseled, patrician features. That face had some vague yet unmistakable touch of the alien visitor to Earth.</p>
    <p>Something caught Court's eye beyond the threshold of the next room. A huge body sprawled there, one hand outstretched toward an instrument panel.</p>
    <p>Court strode toward it.</p>
    <p>He halted, realizing that he was in a laboratory--but no Earthly one! He blinked in astonishment at sight of the apparatus surrounding him. Then, forcing down his curiosity, he knelt beside the prone figure and turned it on its back.</p>
    <p>The man's face was handsome in an arrogantly ferocious way, though a black spade-beard jutted from his pugnacious chin. The giant lay motionless, and Court saw that no breath lifted the hairy barrel chest. Nevertheless he made careful tests, only to realize that the man was pulseless, apparently dead.</p>
    <p>For some reason, Court was not convinced. Could corpses remain in such a perfect state of preservation? Was there not such a thing as catalepsy? He returned to the others, and found that they were equally lifeless, equally well preserved.</p>
    <p>There was the long chance of a wild hunch. Court returned to his own ship and came back with heating pads and stimulants. He paused to consider.</p>
    <p>Which one should he attempt to revive first? The girl? The Chinese? Why not the bearded man? His presence in the laboratory--the heart of the ship--indicated that he was probably a scientist.</p>
    <p>With a grunt of decision, Court went to the prostrate giant and put down his burden.</p>
    <p>Warmth must come first. The heating pads were arranged in armpits and thighs.</p>
    <p>He followed them with adrenalin, with brandy, artificial respiration.</p>
    <p>Court placed his hands in the proper position and forced air from the giant's lungs. Then back, and down again. Down, and up. ...</p>
    <p>With a surge and a rush, the man came back to life. He flung Court off with a swift gesture and sprang up. His hand closed on the switch he had been striving for.</p>
    <p>But he halted and whirled, his yellow cat's-eyes glowering at the smaller man.</p>
    <p>He said something Court did not understand.</p>
    <p>Rising to his feet, Court kept one hand on his gun as he watched the giant warily.</p>
    <p>Abruptly the blackbeard strode past Court and into the next room. When he returned, he was grinning. He stopped at the door and stood with arms akimbo. After a moment he spoke slowly in Latin.</p>
    <p>It was a language that Court, being a scientist, had studied with some thoroughness.</p>
    <p>"I come from Earth," he explained. "The third planet of this Sun. I mean no harm. I awoke you--"</p>
    <p>The other nodded. "I am Thordred. But there is no time to talk now. Tell me, swiftly as you can, how you found us."</p>
    <p>Court obeyed. As he talked, Thordred went into the adjoining room and stood contemplating the silent figures. He stooped beside the slim body on the floor.</p>
    <p>"Dead, I think. Yet--this is your ship?"</p>
    <p>He pointed toward the port.</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>"Well, you will not need it. My ship is yours now."</p>
    <p>A gleam of amusement shone in the yellow eyes as Thordred lifted Ardath's body and carried him into the Terra. He paused to study the controls. After making a careful adjustment, he returned.</p>
    <p>The door of the Terra he closed behind him, then both ports of the larger ship. Court felt a touch of apprehension.</p>
    <p>"Thordred," he said with quick anger in his voice. "What are you doing?"</p>
    <p>The giant turned to a vision screen in the wall.</p>
    <p>He flicked it on.</p>
    <p>"Look!"</p>
    <p>On the screen, Court saw the Terra, flashing away through space. He felt a sudden pang that chilled to cold rage.</p>
    <p>"What right--"</p>
    <p>Thordred grinned. "Slowly, Stephen Court. I have said that this ship is yours. As for him"--black hatred shone in the yellow eyes--"he was a renegade and a traitor. He tried to kill us all. He is dead now, but science and magic may bring even a dead man back to life. So Ardath is going where there is neither science nor magic--toward the Sun!"</p>
    <p>"The Sun!"</p>
    <p>"Yes. I set the controls on your ship. They were not difficult to understand. Ardath is doomed, if a dead man can die again. And now we will attend to the others."</p>
    <p>He glanced at the silent figures on the couches.</p>
    <p>"We'll awaken them?"</p>
    <p>"One at a time. The girl first." Thordred hesitated. "Revive Jansaiya, Court, while I adjust the apparatus. We are going back to Earth."</p>
    <p>"Good." Court smiled. "We need your help."</p>
    <p>His throat felt achingly dry, for at last his search was at an end. With the science of this Thordred added to his own, the Plague could be fought, perhaps conquered.</p>
    <p>Thordred was smiling triumphantly as he went into the laboratory.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>
     <p>The Sleepers Awake</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Court busied himself with the golden-haired girl. Jansaiya's feline, sophisticated green eyes, and the vague suggestion of cruelty about her lips, were not apparent now as she lay in cataleptic sleep. Rather she seemed some elfin creature out of Earth's myth-haunted past, a daughter of Neptune.</p>
    <p>The gossamer, violet-tinted robe scarcely veiled the alluring curves of her slim form. Her lashes lay golden on the rose-petal cheeks. She seemed so helpless, so childlike. Utterly trusting, she lay curled like a kitten on the couch.</p>
    <p>The poignant loveliness of the Atlantean girl was suddenly an aching stab in Court's heart. He felt no passion for her, no infatuation. She was too completely removed from mundane life for that. But Jansaiya curiously seemed to typify and embody for Court something he had never known. Out of the world's youth, she was youth, a symbol of the dreams that most men know before they grow too old.</p>
    <p>Staring down at Jansaiya, Court realized that he had never known youth and wondrous dreams. Unexpectedly he thought of Marion Barton, whom he had left on Earth. He put her out of his mind by working swiftly.</p>
    <p>Occasionally Thordred came to the door of the laboratory to watch, but as time wore on the giant appeared less often. Though he had learned much when the thought-transference helmet had given him the knowledge of Ardath's brain, Thordred had not acquired the Kyrian's super-mentality.</p>
    <p>Guiding the ship back to Earth was a difficult task. Besides, he was busy making certain adjustments on the thought-helmet. So he remained in the laboratory, and did not see Jansaiya waken.</p>
    <p>Court had turned away to stare curiously at the other two sleepers, Li Yang and Scipio the Carthaginian. The giant warrior puzzled him. Since the man wore only a breech-clout, Court found it hard to guess his origin. The color of the skin was Negroid, but the thin, firm, harsh lips and the hair certainly were not. Li Yang, though, was obviously an Oriental. What did that mean? Had this space ship actually come from another world?</p>
    <p>The golden-haired girl might have been born on an alien planet--perhaps even Thordred and the sleeping, naked giant. But the Oriental? Court frowned, and then glanced at Jansaiya as she stirred.</p>
    <p>She had been breathing regularly for some time. Now her lashes fluttered and the green eyes opened. When she looked up at Court, a soft, wordless sound of inquiry murmured from the red lips.</p>
    <p>"Athloyee s'ya voh--"</p>
    <p>Court matched the girl's language, which he did not know was Atlantean, with Latin.</p>
    <p>"Don't try to talk yet. You are safe."</p>
    <p>The brows wrinkled in puzzlement as the cruel gaze scrutinized him.</p>
    <p>"I am safe? Of course. But where is Ardath?"</p>
    <p>"Dead. Thordred--"</p>
    <p>Court paused, startled at the look on Jansaiya's face. He saw fear, and incredulous amazement, and a soft smile of evil triumph that repelled him.</p>
    <p>"Dead?" She turned her head and looked across the room. "Li Yang. Yes. And Scipio. But Thordred, is he dead also?"</p>
    <p>"No. Shall I get him?"</p>
    <p>Court rose, but halted as a slim hand touched him.</p>
    <p>"Wait. Who are you?"</p>
    <p>Before he could reply, Thordred's harsh voice broke in.</p>
    <p>"Jansaiya! You are awake? Good!"</p>
    <p>The giant strode into the room, his amber eyes intent on the girl. Briefly they flickered toward Court.</p>
    <p>"We are in the atmosphere now. There is not much time. Come with me."</p>
    <p>Thordred made a quick, stealthy signal to Jansaiya, which Court failed to understand. The Atlantean girl pursed her lips but said nothing.</p>
    <p>In the laboratory, Thordred pointed to a chair.</p>
    <p>"Sit down, Court. Put on this helmet."</p>
    <p>He picked up a bulky head-piece, crowned with helical wires, and extended it. Court hesitated.</p>
    <p>"What is it?" he asked cautiously.</p>
    <p>"Nothing dangerous. It will teach you my language, and teach me yours. Certain memory patterns--knowledge of our native tongue--will be transferred from my brain to yours, and vice versa. Come."</p>
    <p>Thordred placed a duplicate helmet on his own head and sat down. Some inexplicable impulse made Court resist.</p>
    <p>"I'm not sure--"</p>
    <p>The giant grinned suddenly.</p>
    <p>"I told you I mean you no harm. If I had wanted to kill you, I could have done it long ago. I need your knowledge, and you need mine." Thordred chuckled at some secret thought. "And it is best that we know each other's language."</p>
    <p>"All right"</p>
    <p>Court nodded and slipped the helmet on his head. Simultaneously Thordred leaned forward and touched a keyboard, there was a whining crackle of released energy. Court felt the momentary agony of intolerable stricture about his skull, then it was gone. The scene before him was blotted out by a curtain of darkness. He lost consciousness. . . .</p>
    <p>It seemed scarcely a second later when he awoke. Painfully opening his eyes, he saw that the laboratory was empty. His head ached fearfully. The helmet, however, was gone, as he discovered by investigating with his hands.</p>
    <p>"Awake, eh?" The words were unmistakably in English. Thordred stood on the threshold. He went to a shelf, took a flask from it, and gave it to Court. "Drink this. It's a stimulant. Not like your--what was it--brandy, but equally potent."</p>
    <p>Court gulped the fluid, which was tasteless and incredibly cold. Immediately his headache was gone. He glanced up at the giant.</p>
    <p>"You learned English, I see. That helmet's a handy gadget. But I didn't learn your language!"</p>
    <p>"No," Thordred admitted. "The adjustment wasn't quite accurate. But it doesn't matter. There's plenty of time. Meanwhile, as you say, I can talk English. Only that was necessary for us to be able to discuss scientific principles."</p>
    <p>Stephen saw the common sense of that. There were no ancient Latin terms for modern scientific theories and devices.</p>
    <p>"Where are we now?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"On Earth." Thordred glanced searchingly at him. "Court, I'll be frank with you. I learned more than merely your language from your mind. The Plague that worries you, for example. I acquired your memory of that."</p>
    <p>"You did?"</p>
    <p>Court's dark face twisted in a scowl as he felt the premonition of danger. Just how much had Thordred learned from him? He shrugged, knowing that it did not matter. The bearded giant was a friend, the only strong ally on Earth. Why look for trouble where none existed?</p>
    <p>"I've decided what's best to be done," Thordred said. "This Plague--I know no more about it than you do. I don't know its origin or nature, nor any way of defeating it."</p>
    <p>Court leaped to his feet, a sick emptiness in his stomach.</p>
    <p>"Thordred! With your science and mine, we should be able to find some way of conquering it."</p>
    <p>"There's only one way. Earth is doomed. Anyone who remains will eventually be destroyed. But this is a space ship, Court, and it isn't necessary for us to wait for destruction." With a lifted hand, Thordred forestalled interruption. "Wait. There are other planets where life is possible, where the Plague doesn't exist. We can carry from fifty to seventy passengers, men and women. That will be enough to start a new race and civilization on another world."</p>
    <p>"No!" Court scarcely knew he spoke. "You mean go off and leave the world to doom?"</p>
    <p>"What good would it be to stay? We'd merely guarantee our own destruction. You're a strong, intelligent man, Court, the sort of person I want in the civilization I shall build. That's why I did not kill you."</p>
    <p>Court's eyes narrowed. There was a dead silence. Thordred's chill glance did not falter.</p>
    <p>"I can kill you, even now, quite easily," he went on slowly. "But the choice is yours. Join me, serve me with your fine brain and muscles, and you need not die. What's your answer?"</p>
    <p>Court was silent, trying to analyze his feelings. Of course his anxiety to defeat the Plague was purely scientific. How could he, a super-intellect, feel any sympathy for ordinary men and women? What did it matter if Earth died, as long as a new civilization would be built on a distant, safer world?</p>
    <p>A bell rang sharply through the ship. When Thordred flicked on a vision screen, Court stared at it.</p>
    <p>The space ship had landed in what seemed to be a park. Suddenly he recognized it as Central Park, in New York. About the ship, a cordon of police was keeping back a surging crowd. A small group of uniformed men huddled close to the hull, using an acetylene torch to burn through the metal.</p>
    <p>Thordred grinned. "Perhaps I could have landed in a less populated spot, but I'm impregnable, with the weapons at my command. One flash of a certain ray, and that crowd will be burned to cinders."</p>
    <p>"You don't intend to--" Court heard himself saying.</p>
    <p>"But I do. The sooner Earth learns my power, the better!"</p>
    <p>Thordred turned and went to a control board. Stephen Court stared at him. The emotions he had rigidly subdued all his We were flooding up into that cold brain of his. But it was not cold now. Burning in Court's mind was the face of Marion Barton, tender with humanity. He saw the face of old Sammy, brown and wrinkled. Sammy had sacrificed himself for an ideal in which Court did not believe.</p>
    <p>He had not believed in it till now. Court's heritage, the basic humanity in him, suddenly flooded through the artificial barriers of restraint. He had fought the Plague to save men and women from horrible death, though he had not realized his true motive till now. Falsely he had told himself that he was a scientific machine. He had almost hypnotized himself into believing it. But all along, Court realized now, his motives had been those of common humanity.</p>
    <p>A super-mentality, perhaps, but first of all he was a man! He would instinctively fight to protect those weaker than himself, even against insuperable odds.</p>
    <p>Court's breath caught in his throat as he saw Thordred push a lever in the control board. With silent desperation he hurled himself at the bearded giant.</p>
    <p>He was hurled back by a paralyzing shock. Thordred whirled, his mouth gaping. As Court tensed himself for another leap, the giant halted him with a lifted hand.</p>
    <p>"You fool, you can't penetrate this force screen around my body. Stay where you are!"</p>
    <p>Court did not move, but his lean figure quivered with suppressed fury.</p>
    <p>"You have your science, Thordred, but so have I."</p>
    <p>"Your science?" Thordred bellowed. He thrust out a huge hand, gripped Court. "Listen to me! I told you I learned more from you than your language. That was true. I drained your brain of all the knowledge it held. Your memory is mine now."</p>
    <p>Court went sick as the import of the words struck home. His gaze went from Thordred's face, moved swiftly about the laboratory for some weapon. But the apparatus was utterly unfamiliar to him. Yet it had to be based on rigid scientific principles that would be the same in any universe.</p>
    <p>Court's mind worked with frantic speed, trying to find some coherent pattern. Levers, buttons, wiring, transparent tubes--each one had its definite part. On one panel, several red lights were flashing on and off. Below each light, Court recognized what must have been push-buttons.</p>
    <p>There were two possible answers. Either the switchboard had some connection with Thordred's death ray, of which he had spoken, or else it was part of an alarm system. It was probably an alarm system, since Thordred was busy at another instrument panel. The police outside the ship were trying to burn through a port, and the red light was flashing. The button beneath that light, Court decided, probably opened the door.</p>
    <p>His face was immobile as he shrugged, deliberately letting his shoulders droop despairingly. Thordred's mouth twisted into a triumphant grin. He half turned from his prisoner, and his hand touched the lever again.</p>
    <p>And then Court sprang--not at Thordred. He leaped toward the panel where the red light glowed. His finger stabbed out and depressed the button!</p>

    <p>Thordred's roar came too late. A burst of sound welled into the ship. Men were shouting, and footsteps tramped loudly on the metal floor of the air-lock. Court sped to meet them. His hands lifted above his head, he was shouting warning. The skin of his back crawled with expectation of an attack.</p>
    <p>But Thordred did not pursue. Instead, there came a sizzling crackle from behind Court. Strong hands caught him, and he found himself in the midst of a group of police. He turned.</p>
    <p>Across the door of the laboratory, a veil of wavering light flickered. Court seized the arm of an officer to prevent him from moving toward the hazy glow.</p>
    <p>"Wait! That's dangerous."</p>
    <p>"What do you mean? Who are you?"</p>
    <p>"Never mind that now. Shoot through that light, but don't go near it. You may be electrocuted."</p>
    <p>The leader of the group, a gray-haired, bulky man, stared.</p>
    <p>"I know you. You're Stephen Court. I've seen your pictures in the paper. What is all this about, anyhow?"</p>
    <p>Court swiftly noted the insignia of rank on the man's blue sleeve.</p>
    <p>"There's no time now, Sergeant. There's a killer beyond that light barrier. He's got to be stopped!"</p>
    <p>"But we can't shoot down a man on your word."</p>
    <p>Court sucked in his breath, then his hand went out in a blurring motion.</p>
    <p>Grabbing a heavy revolver from one of the officers, he whirled and pumped bullets at the barrier of fire. Flame crackled and snarled. The bullets could not penetrate the barrier. Half-melted, they dropped to the floor.</p>
    <p>The revolver was wrested from his hand. The sergeant eyed him in amazement, holding the smoking gun.</p>
    <p>"I tell you--"</p>
    <p>Court made a gesture of despair as he heard a low whine, rising in pitch and intensity, throbbing through the ship. He knew that Thordred was busy in the laboratory. He tried a new tack.</p>
    <p>"This ship may be blown up at any minute. Get your men out. Keep the crowd back." He hesitated, then pointed to the unconscious forms of the Chinese and the gargoyle-faced giant on their couches. "Get them out, too."</p>
    <p>Jansaiya, the Atlantean girl, was nowhere in sight, and there was not time to search for her.</p>
    <p>The menace of explosion the sergeant could understand. He issued swift orders. His men swarmed out of the ship, carrying the cataleptic men.</p>
    <p>Court followed. He could not guess what Thordred would do now, but he suspected that the killer might loose his death rays on the mob. Orders ran from one officer to another. The crowd was pushed back, milling, asking questions, shuffling unwillingly.</p>
    <p>Standing at the sergeant's side, Court bit his lip in indecision. What now? Thordred was impregnable behind his force screen. Without equipment, Court could do nothing. With the right apparatus, he knew, he could find the vibration-rate of the screen and neutralize it. But there was no equipment here.</p>
    <p>"This got anything to do with the Plague?" the sergeant said. "We're evacuating New York, you know." "What? Evacuating New York!"</p>
    <p>"Yeah. The Plague's hit us. The city's a death-trap, with eight million people here. Martial law's been declared, though, and everything's under control. The whole city's moving out before the Plague spreads." Court nodded, staring at the ship.</p>
    <p>"Well, clear the park and get some planes to bomb our friend there. I don't know if explosive will harm him, but it's worth trying while there's still time. As for those two unconscious men you took out of the ship, get them to a hospital. We'll--"</p>
    <p>There was a sudden interruption. From the golden hull, a ray of cold green brilliance probed. As it shot toward Court, he felt a wave of icy chill. All the strength was abruptly drained from his body. He felt himself falling. . . .</p>
    <p>The ray flamed brighter, turned to yellow, then to white. It splashed in pale radiance over the sergeant. His strong face seemed to melt, the flesh blackening incindery horror over the bone-structure. The officer dropped without a sound. . . .</p>
    <p>Through filming eyes, Court saw the golden space ship rise from its resting place. It shot up and hovered. Fleeing abruptly into the western skies, it was gone!</p>
    <p>When the ray touched Court, it had not been strong enough to kill, only to paralyze. But the sergeant was horribly dead.</p>
    <p>Court felt himself slipping down into the black pit of unconsciousness. His last memory was that of some small bird wheeling above him against the blue. Then darkness took him.</p>
    <p>Hearing returned to him first. The sound was confused and chaotic. Court lay motionless, striving to analyze it. As if from a vast distance, he seemed to hear a babble of voices faintly mumbling what sounded like gibberish. Piercing through this was a medley of shrill whistles and siren-like noises that were utterly inexplicable.</p>
    <p>Then Court opened his eyes, looked straight up at a bare white ceiling. Sunlight made square patterns on it.</p>
    <p>He could move, he discovered. Without difficulty he .sat up, found that he was in one of a row of cots that ran down the length of a long room. He was in a hospital!</p>
    <p>Court's voice cracked when he cried out. He tried again, but roused only an echo. Wonderingly he rubbed his chin and gasped in amazement. A beard? He must have been unconscious for two weeks, at least!</p>
    <p>He rose, shivering in his regulation hospital nightgown. Though the windows were closed, the room was icy cold. Rocking weakly on his feet, Court looked around.</p>
    <p>The man in the next bed looked familiar. It was the obese Oriental he had last seen in the golden space ship! The man lay silent, motionless, no breath lifting his huge paunch.</p>
    <p>In the cot beyond lay the scar-faced giant, the man who had resembled a gladiator. He, too, was apparently dead or cataleptic.</p>
    <p>Some of the other beds were occupied, Court saw. He made a quick investigation. Strangers, and dead, all of them, some had plainly died of starvation and thirst. The blankets in most cases were tumbled and twisted, and some of the bodies on the floor where they had apparently flung themselves. One grizzled oldster was huddled in a heap near the door, his skinny hand still outstretched for aid that could never come.</p>
    <p>The hospital must have been deserted. But what could have caused medical men to forsake their patients? Physicians do not break the Hippocratic Oath so easily. That meant--The Plague!</p>
    <p>His throat tight, Court stumbled to a table where a carafe of water stood. It was stagnant with long standing and half evaporated, but he gulped down a repulsive swallow.</p>
    <p>A folded newspaper on the table caught his gaze. Hastily he folded the paper to the first page. Flaring headlines greeted him.</p>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>PLAGUE STRIKES NEW YORK!</p>
    <p>20 Carriers Reported in Manhattan;</p>
    <p>Mayor Orders City Evacuated!</p>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Hastily linotyped columns gave the story. All over Greater New York, the Plague had suddenly appeared. In Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, from Harlem to the Battery--the shining men, harbingers of weird death, had come into being.</p>
    <p>Thinking the invasion had arrived by way of Jersey and the surrounding area, the mayor had directed the evacuation to take place northward. But in the box labeled "Latest News Bulletins," it became apparent that the infection was spreading with fatal speed. Among eight millions of people, the Plague ran like wildfire.</p>
    <p>Well, judging by his beard and the date of the paper, that had been two weeks ago. What was the country like now?</p>
    <p>Court went to the window and stared out. The bleak, snow-covered expanse of Central Park was far below. Small, irregular dark blotches lay on the whiteness. Were they bodies?</p>
    <p>Court found a telephone and jiggled the receiver impatiently. Not even the dial-tone answered him. New York must be entirely deserted, save by the dead!</p>
    <p>Again he went to the window. This time he saw a shining oval of light, dwarfed by distance, gliding under the trees in the park. A Carrier. ...</p>
    <p>Court knew he could not remain in New York. With a nod of decision, he glanced at the two motionless figures on the cots beside his own. Hastily he began to gather equipment. He saw a use for the Oriental and the giant. He could not leave them here, frozen in cataleptic sleep, even if he did not think that their knowledge might prove valuable.</p>
    <p>He used heat, stimulants and artificial respiration. The stimulants were easy to procure after a trip down the corridor into adjoining wards. It was harder to find adrenalin. Court had to break down a door before locating the drug, but finally he was ready.</p>
    <p>Electricity, rather than gas, supplied the hospital. He knew there would be no current now. Court hesitated. Frowning, he stared out the window. He heard again the distant din that had awakened him--the faint hooting, and the low mumble of far voices.</p>
    <p>Radios, of course! Innumerable radios had been left turned on when the evacuation had taken place, and they were still broadcasting. That meant there was still electricity. Relieved, Court found heating pads and pressed them into place about his two patients.</p>
    <p>Little artificial respiration was necessary. Under the shock of the adrenalin, first the giant, and then the Oriental, stirred. They wakened almost together.</p>
    <p>Court gave a gasp of relief. Till then he had not realized just how much his fortnight of hypnotized slumber had weakened him. Despite slowed and retarded metabolism, he had not eaten nor drunk for weeks. Shivering, he sank down on a cot and watched his patients slowly and gradually awaken.</p>
    <p>There was so much to do! He must communicate with these two. But what language did they speak? Would they be able to understand Latin? After that, there would be so many things! Find out what had happened, leave New York safely--</p>
    <p>"But the first thing," Court murmured, "is to stow some food under my belt. No," he resolved, glancing down at his nightgown. "The first thing I need is a pair of pants!"</p>

     <p>CHAPTER XV.</p>
     <p>Under the Plague</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>It was nearly an hour later when Court finally finished his story and learned from Li Yang and Scipio their own tale. Luckily both understood Latin. When Court's knowledge of the language failed, he pieced it out in Greek, which Scipio knew.</p>
    <p>"I am familiar with all the tongues spoken around the Middle Sea--the Mediterranean," the huge Carthaginian stated. "This English of yours sounds like a hybrid language, a mixture of Latin, Greek, Goth, and Zeus knows what else. However, I will learn it. We had a saying that those in Helvetia had best do as the Helvetians do, though all they generally did was freeze."</p>
    <p>Scipio chuckled deep in his barrel chest.</p>
    <p>"We have a saying that jackasses bray at inopportune moments," said Li Yang blandly. "Therefore, hold your tongue, Scipio, while we make some plans." He sighed ponderously. "So Ardath is dead, eh? Eheu, he was a wise man, and a good one. Also I have lost my lute, so I grieve."</p>
    <p>"I scarcely knew Ardath," Scipio confessed, "though he saved my life, of course. But the nymph-girl, Jansaiya--I needed only a glimpse of her to lose my heart and soul." The gargoyle face twisted in pained memory. "What had we best do, Court?"</p>
    <p>"Get out of New York. After that, we can make our plans. I want to get back to my laboratory. But first--well, come along."</p>
    <p>Court rose and led the others into the corridor. Li Yang shivered as the chill wind rustled under his scanty gown.</p>
    <p>"The world has grown colder," he mourned. "Not even on the Northern steppes did I feel such a knifelike blast."</p>
    <p>Court was unavailingly pressing the elevator buttons.</p>
    <p>"Guess they're not working," he said wryly. "That means we'll have to walk all the way down. It'll keep us warm, anyway. Watch out for any Carriers."</p>
    <p>Scipio shook his head as the three hurried down the stairs.</p>
    <p>"I do not understand this Plague. Civilizations change, of course. New gods and new magics spring up. But what you tell me of this Plague smacks of the vrykrolokas, the vampire."</p>
    <p>The others had no breath for talking. Scipio continued to muse aloud as they descended. When they reached the street, though, he was the only one who was not panting.</p>
    <p>"Zeus, Apollo, Kronos, and Neptune!" he roared, staring up at the skyscrapers. "Surely the gods must have reared these buildings!"</p>
    <p>"Did gods build the Nilotic pyramids?" Li Yang asked with breathless irony. "Men learn always, and always they build higher. But my poor toes will be frozen!" He danced about grotesquely in the slush. "You are a hardy race, Court, to walk about in these skimpy togas." Court was glancing about swiftly.</p>
    <p>"Come in here," he said.</p>
    <p>He hurried toward a nearby shop. He had seen that the window was broken, and a burglar alarm was clanging loudly from within. That explained the medley of noises he had heard from the hospital. Hundreds of burglar alarms, all over New York, were screaming. The mobs must have looted during their flight. This men's clothing shop had certainly been looted, judging by its appearance. Court could understand why property rights didn't mean much just now.</p>
    <p>He guided Li Yang and Scipio to the various departments, and helped them outfit themselves with suitable clothing.</p>
    <p>"Breeches and boots will be best, I think," he suggested. "We may have hard going. Pick out large-sized boots or you'll blister your feet in an hour."</p>
    <p>It was difficult to find clothing that fitted the gigantic Carthaginian, and even harder to equip Li Yang, but at last the task was finished. Completely clothed, even to fleece-lined gloves, the three returned to the street.</p>
    <p>Now they needed food and drink. Down the avenue a little way was an Automat. Court led them into it, pausing at the entrance to examine a motionless, shrunken body that lay there.</p>
    <p>It was the corpse of a man, emaciated and pallid, frozen rigid. It was oddly shriveled, which Court recognized as the stigmata of Plague victims. Though the man had certainly been dead since the evacuation of New York, there was no sign of decomposition.</p>
    <p>"Draining of vital energy means absolute sterility, no germs or microbes--that's logical," Court muttered.</p>
    <p>At least there would be no danger of a pestilence. He smiled crookedly. Pestilence?</p>
    <p>There was nobody to be harmed by it, anyway.</p>
    <p>A radio in the Automat was humming noisily. Court hesitated, still inhibited by a lifetime of conditioning. But he went to the change desk, and appropriated a handful of nickels.</p>
    <p>Supplying the others with trays, he carefully selected foods that appeared still edible. The coffee spigot ran a tar-colored, icy fluid. But it was somewhat better than the sour milk and stale water.</p>
    <p>Court went to the radio and adjusted it. Then he joined the others at one of the round little tables.</p>
    <p>"News," he said, nodding at the box that was strange to them. "I'll translate."</p>
    <p>"Static is becoming increasingly troublesome as the Plague grows," the radio blared. "The electrical energy emitted by She Carriers interferes with broadcasting. European shortwave transmission is impossible. The transoceanic cables have failed. From Washington, D.C., comes the latest European news, brought by Clipper across the Atlantic.</p>
    <p>"The Plague seems to have concentrated its force so far in the Western Hemisphere, though its strength is increasing gradually in Europe. Ports are crowded as mobs try to storm their way on to ships outward bound. There is a feeling that on the high seas is safety. This is untrue."</p>
    <p>"The Hozima Maru, a passenger ship, was today washed upon the coast at Point Reyes, above San Francisco. Spectators reported that the only living beings aboard were several Carriers."</p>
    <p>In grim undertones Court translated.</p>
    <p>"The Eastern Seaboard is still being evacuated," the voice went on. "The United States is under martial law. As yet the Plague remains a mystery, though all over the world, scientists are working night and day to check it. A scientific congress has been called at The Hague, to convene tomorrow at noon. . . ,</p>
    <p>"We are still receiving reports about the mysterious golden airship which first appeared in Central Park, New York, two weeks ago. Since then it has landed eight times, always in a sparsely populated area. Unconfirmed reports state that men and women have been forced to enter the ship. Two hours ago, according to San Francisco's station KFRC, the ship landed on the Berkeley hills."</p>
    <p>Court's voice rose excitedly as he translated. Scipio sat back with a grunt, and the Oriental pursed his red lips.</p>
    <p>"So Thordred's still on Earth." Li Yang rubbed his fat hands together. "Good! Court, there are marvels of science in that golden ship, all the wonders of Ardath's great civilization. If you can get your hands on them--"</p>
    <p>Court frowned. "As soon as Thordred finishes recruiting the people he needs to start a new life on a different planet, he'll vanish forever. The worst of it is, he's drained my mind, taken all my knowledge. Everything I know, I share with him now. But I've got to get back to my Wisconsin lab.</p>
    <p>"I have apparatus there that will enable me to construct a weapon or two that might give me a chance against Thordred. But till I get to the lab, I can't even locate the golden ship.</p>
    <p>'Then why do we wait here?" Scipio thrust back his chair and stood up, towering incongruously in the gleaming shininess of the Automat. "Let us hurry!"</p>
    <p>They went out. Behind them the radio blared:</p>
    <p>"Shall keep broadcasting as long as we are able. The city is entirely evacuated. We are barricaded in this station, and shall remain here until our power fails, or until . . . This is WOR, Newark, New Jersey. All listeners are warned to leave their homes immediately and--"</p>
    <p>Fifth Avenue lay silent under a white mantle. Snow had fallen within the past twenty-four hours. The sky, however, was blue and cloudless. Singularly eerie was the silence that lay over New York, made more horrible by the mutter of radios and the distant jarring of alarms. These, too, would die when the power failed.</p>
    <p>There were bodies in the streets, most of them white-mounded hummocks under the snow. Hundreds of automobiles had been wrecked. A huge bus lay on its side beside an overturned garbage truck.</p>
    <p>Twice they saw Carriers--shining, pallid ovals of glowing radiance--floating toward them. Each time Court led his companions into buildings and through a roundabout course of passages and stairways that led them to safety.</p>
    <p>"The subway might be safer," he mused, "but there may be Carriers down there. And the power's still on, of course."</p>
    <p>Court did not mention his fear of the carnage he might discover underground. Yet curiously the Plague had left little horror in its wake. It was far too fantastically unreal. The bombs and shrapnel of war would have left blood and ruin. But this. . . . There was only white silence, and bodies that were less like corpses than cold statues of marble.</p>
    <p>"Here." Court halted by a parked automobile. "No, there's no gas." He frowned, after a glance at the dashboard gauge. "Come on."</p>
    <p>Scipio was peering into a window. Abruptly he kicked nigh, and the glass fell in clattering shards. The Carthaginian reached through the gap and brought out a cavalry saber in its scabbard.</p>
    <p>It's light enough," he grunted, balancing the weapon in his hand. "But it's sharp. We may need this."</p>
    <p>He fastened it to his belt, while Li Yang was peering down the street.</p>
    <p>"Court!" the Oriental called. "What is it?"</p>
    <p>"A Carrier--"</p>
    <p>"I see it."</p>
    <p>Swiftly Court guided his companions around the corner. They turned west from Fifth Avenue into Fifty-eighth Street. Half a block down, they paused at sight of two more Carriers coming toward them.</p>
    <p>Court glanced around. On his right was a street blocked with a mass of automobile wreckage. The tower of Rockefeller Plaza rose into the sky. On his left was the entrance of an office building. But through the glass doors, Court could see that the lobby was strewn with bodies, struck down as they had tried to escape the onrushing Plague.</p>
    <p>Court wondered with a strange twinge of pity, how many of them had been ready for death. Probably none.</p>
    <p>He came to himself abruptly. There was no time for philosophizing. The Carriers were closing in upon them from both sides. Scipio pointed to the side street.</p>
    <p>"There. We can climb over."</p>
    <p>"Wait!" Court's sharp command halted the others on the curb. "Here's a car."</p>
    <p>A large, black sedan was parked a few feet away. Two bodies lay near it--a man's and a woman's. The girl, scarcely more than a child, lay in a pitiful little huddle on the running-board, her blond hair whitened with snow. The man, a bulky, dark young fellow, lay with his face in the gutter, a cigar still drooping from one corner of his mouth.</p>
    <p>But the keys were in the ignition. Hastily Court sprang into the car, turned the key and pressed the starter. He really expected no response. To his surprise, the battery painfully turned the cold engine over.</p>
    <p>Court dared waste no more time. He glanced around. With a gasp of relief, he saw that the shining bodies of the Carriers had halted. They were at least a hundred feet away, and there might still be time.</p>
    <p>He kept his foot down on the starter. The motor caught and abruptly died. Viciously he manipulated the choke.</p>
    <p>"Get ready to run!" he warned.</p>
    <p>But again the motor caught, and Court gunned it with great care. The echoes boomed out thunderously in the canyon or the street. Li Yang and Scipio sat tensely beside Court, more afraid of this noisy invention than the incomprehensible Carriers.</p>
    <p>"They are coming toward us, Scipio reported in an undertone, feeling for his saber. "I shall get out and hold them back till--"</p>
    <p>"No!" Court let out the clutch. "Stay where you are."</p>
    <p>The car jerked into motion. There was a sickening moment when the motor sputtered, coughed, and almost stopped.</p>
    <p>Court jammed down the gas, heard the exhaust pipe crack open with a deafening roar. Then they were plunging forward. . . .</p>
    <p>But the Carriers were ominously close. Into Court's mind came a weird, illogical thought--"Pillars of fire and smoke." Was that it? It didn't matter, for two of them, directly ahead, were gliding toward the car.</p>
    <p>He spun the wheel, skidded on the slushy pavement. He shot between the two monsters, missing them by a hair's breadth. The sedan rocketed on, gathering speed.</p>
    <p>Court swallowed hard and wiped the perspiration from his forehead with the back of his hand.</p>
    <p>"Narrow squeak. . . . This is a one-way street," he added with wry humor, "and we're going the wrong way. But I doubt if we'll get a ticket."</p>
    <p>They crossed Sixth Avenue, then Seventh, and turned left on Broadway. Court headed for the Holland Tunnel. Before he reached the tube, he sighted a tangle of wreckage which told him that route was closed. Hastily he turned north along the Hudson, hoping he could get through at the George Washington Bridge.</p>
    <p>The ice-bordered river flowed past silently, unruffled now by any boats. In the distance, the Jersey Palisades were traceries of frost. No smoke at all rose on the skyline.</p>
    <p>"Gods!" Scipio observed. "This is a world of wonders, Court. What is that?"</p>
    <p>"Grant's Tomb," said Court. "Let's see what the radio says."</p>
    <p>He switched it on, but got only static. He turned the switch off, for he did not know the battery's strength. He had almost a tankful of gas, he saw, and was grateful for that. Yet it would not take him to Wisconsin.</p>
    <p>He would take the straight western route toward Chicago, and then cut northwest, unless he could find an airplane. But in this disorganized area, Court doubted whether one would be available. They all must have been commandeered.</p>
    <p>The bridge was open. They shot across, disregarding the glaring speed-limit signs.</p>
    <p>Court found the highway he wanted. He sped on, seeing no sign of Me. He was reminded of the last time he had driven across the Wisconsin hills, with Marion at his side. It almost seemed as though nothing had happened since then, for the landscape was still incongruously peaceful. Only one thing betrayed the existence of the Plague--the occasional wrecks seen beside the highway, and the absence of traffic. An airplane startlingly roared overhead against the blue.</p>
    <p>But Marion was not here. Court realized that he missed her. She was the perfect complement for his mind, the ideal assistant. There was something else, too, but Court subconsciously steered away from the thought, refusing to let himself realize why he missed Marion so profoundly. He could see her clearly, a slim brown-eyed girl. . . .</p>
    <p>Rot! Such thoughts wasted time, and there was no time to waste. Sitting beside Court now, crowded uncomfortably in the front seat, Scipio and the huge Li Yang writhed uneasily. They typified the whole new set of factors which Court must integrate into the problem facing him. His mind began to work at lightning speed. Analyzing, probing, discarding-- swiftly he went over the problem as he drove the car instinctively through New Jersey.</p>
    <p>Scipio crawled over into the back seat and went to sleep. Li Yang stretched luxuriously, holding out his plump fingers to the car heater.</p>
    <p>"Great magic," he said with satisfaction. "Not that I believe in magic, but the word is a handy one."</p>
    <p>The sedan thundered westward.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>
     <p>Thordred Strikes</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>During the two weeks of Court's unconsciousness, a great deal had happened. Many large cities, like Manhattan, had been evacuated. If many Carriers had appeared at once, chaos might have been the result. But the Plague came with comparative slowness at first Martial law, of course, had been declared, resulting in less indirect mortality than might-have been expected.</p>
    <p>The refugees faced neither starvation nor epidemic. With well oiled speed, the Federal Government had swung into action. All over the country, the evacuated populations of such cities as New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and New Orleans were billeted in hospitable homes.</p>
    <p>But the danger remained. More and more of the Carriers appeared. Shining, nebulous clouds of glowing fog, they slew by touch alone. There was no possible protection, for even lead armor was not always certain. Moreover, nobody knew the nature of these dread beings.</p>
    <p>Court racked his brain as he furiously drove on. Parts of the pattern were falling into place. Entropy, he thought, was the clue. The most puzzling problem was the apparent existence of an utterly alien element--the mysterious X.</p>
    <p>In a sane universe, this could not exist. It could not be alien. For a time he pondered the Heisenberg uncertainty factor, but discarded it as a new idea came to him.</p>
    <p>The catalyst angle was perhaps the most logical one. Absently he reached into the dashboard compartment, expecting to find cigarettes. There was a pack in it, nearly full. Court pressed in the dashboard cigarette lighter. Li Yang watched with interest.</p>
    <p>Court took the glowing lighter and held it to his cigarette. Abruptly he paused, staring at the lighter. He whistled startledly under his breath. The Oriental blinked in astonishment.</p>
    <p>"What--"</p>
    <p>"An idea. Just an idea. A parallel, like conduction. Listen, Li Yang. If you take a red-hot chunk of steel and put it next to a cold piece, what'll happen?"</p>
    <p>"The cold piece will be warmed."</p>
    <p>"Yes. The heat will be transmitted. Only, it isn't heat in this case. It's XI X is being transmitted to living beings. . . ." Court rubbed his forehead. "What is X? Energy? Sure, but-- I've got it!" He almost lost his grip on the wheel in his excitement "I've got it, Li Yang! Entropy, life, energy--cosmic evolution!"</p>
    <p>"Words," said the Oriental, shrugging indifferently. "What do they mean?"</p>
    <p>Court began to talk slowly, carefully, picking his way along the new theory.</p>
    <p>"Evolution goes on constantly, you know. From the day the first amoeba was born, evolution kept on steadily. It'll always do that, all over this Universe, and in other ones, too. Well, what's the ultimate evolution of life?"</p>
    <p>"To what man is it given to know that?" Li Yang replied fatalistically.</p>
    <p>"There have been lots of theories. Plenty of science-fiction writers have speculated about it--people like Verne and Wells. Some of them say we'll evolve into bodiless brains. Well, that isn't quite logical. Rather, it doesn't go far enough. Brains are made of cellular tissue, and therefore can die. But thought--life energy--is the ultimate form. The final evolution is toward bodiless energy, life without form or shape. A gas, perhaps."</p>
    <p>The Oriental nodded. "I think I see. Well?" Court swung the sedan around a curve, taking it wide to avoid an overturned roadster.</p>
    <p>"Entropy goes on, regardless. Eventually a universe is destroyed. Matter itself breaks up. But this life energy isn't matter. It's left unchanged. It floats on through the void, like a dark nebula." His eyes widened.</p>
    <p>"Perhaps that's the explanation for dark nebulae, like the Coal Sack, for example. Well, that doesn't matter. This cosmic cloud of life energy drifts through space. If it happens to reach a newly formed planet like Earth billions of years ago, life is generated in the seas, and the cycle starts again. But if We already exists--" "As on Earth now?"</p>
    <p>"Yes. The chunk of hot steel warms the cold one. Only, it isn't heat that's transmitted. It's pure life energy, the super-life to which we'll evolve at the end of our Universe. We're not ready for that yet, but it's come of its own accord."</p>
    <p>"I am not sure I understand," Li Yang said thoughtfully. "Take a familiar parallel. We know today that there's a hormone which causes growth. A hormone is a glandular extract. If we inject an overdose of that into an infant, he'll grow enormously. But he'll probably be an idiot, with little control over his huge body. He should have been left to grow naturally, for he wasn't ready for the hormone in such a large dose.</p>
    <p>"Neither is the Earth ready for so large a step forward in evolution. But we've got an overdose of pure life energy, and it's transforming human beings into another form of hie." "Demons," Li Yang said quietly. Court smiled uncomfortably.</p>
    <p>"Perhaps. At least into poor devils. Well, that's the answer, but it still does not help matters. Here's a town, and I think it has an airport."</p>
    <p>The field was a flurry of brightly lit activity. No Carriers had yet appeared in this New Jersey city, but the air of tension was inevitable. By dint of argument, threats, pleas, and coercion, Court managed to charter a plane, though he would have no success in getting a pilot. Their services were difficult to obtain, because of the national emergency. It was lucky that Court knew bow to fly.</p>
    <p>He took time to drink black, scalding coffee at the airport restaurant, where curious glances were cast at his strange companions.</p>
    <p>There was little information he could gain from the scattered scraps of conversation. No one could guess where the Plague might strike next. At the first sign of it, evacuation must take place, with the aid of every automobile, railroad, and plane that could be pressed into service.</p>
    <p>A few local residents wandered in to stare curiously at the unusual activity. Their lives would continue in normal routine until the Plague actually arrived on their doorsteps.</p>
    <p>Refreshed, Court took his companions into the plane, a speedy gyrocraft cabin ship. He felt grateful that he would not have to drive by car to Wisconsin. The trip would have necessitated a stop for sleeping. But in the plane, he could reach his destination in six hours or so.</p>
    <p>Li Yang and Scipio were not startled by the air journey, for the golden space ship had accustomed them to aerial travel. They watched with interest the countryside below. There was little chance to talk.</p>
    <p>The plane swept over Chicago, a desolate, evacuated metropolis. Chicagoans, Court had learned, were quartered all over Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and even Ontario. Canada, of course, had thrown open its Border. For days, crowded boats had been plying between Chicago and Benton Harbor in Michigan.</p>
    <p>The Plague had not struck Milwaukee, however, though transportation facilities were held in readiness there. Actually only a few cities had been disrupted, and Plague deaths had been surprisingly few. The real peril, which not many knew, lay in the future, if the Plague spread and remained incurable.</p>
    <p>At Madison, Court landed and rented a car.</p>
    <p>The headlights were pale spears stabbing through the gloom as the highway unrolled monotonously. Court was beginning to feel sleepy, but he had purchased some benzedrine sulphate in Madison. He gulped some of the stimulant, which refreshed him.</p>
    <p>In the back seat, Scipio polished his saber with an oiled rag he had found. Li Yang slept, choking and snoring, his head rolling ponderously in collars of fat.</p>
    <p>Now and again, Court caught sight of Carriers--shining blobs of radiance that flashed toward them and were gone. What would happen if the car struck one? Would it rush through an impalpable glow, or would there be a catastrophic explosion of liberated energy? Court's mind felt so blurred that he could not think clearly. His hands ached and trembled on the wheel. His elbow joints were throbbing. The soles of his feet seemed to be on fire.</p>
    <p>But he could not stop and rest. Home was not far now, and even then there would be no peace. . . .</p>
    <p>The road was familiar to him. Wisconsin lay under yellow moonlight, and beside the road, the river flowed along silently.</p>
    <p>They topped a rise and came in sight of the village. It seemed unchanged. But as they swept toward it, Court noticed the absence of lights and movements.</p>
    <p>The street was completely deserted. From the general store, a radio crackled inaudibly. On the store's porch was the body of a man in overalls, grotesquely sprawled. A dog slunk into view, stood frozen for a second, and then fled.</p>
    <p>Court thought with alarm of Marion Barton. Had she returned to the laboratory? Probably. But had she fled with the general exodus?</p>
    <p>Court's heart jumped as he saw a shining, shapeless glow drift into view from around a corner. A Carrier! Another of the horrors was joining the first But they made no effort to molest the speeding automobile.</p>
    <p>Court sucked in his breath. Once he reached the laboratory, all the weapons of his scientific career lay ready to his fingers. Then, knowing as he did the secret of the Plague, he could fight, perhaps destroy the Plague--and finally Thordred. Marion could help. Her aid would be invaluable, if--</p>
    <p>"How much farther?" Scipio grunted from the back seat.</p>
    <p>Li Yang woke up and sleepily rubbed his eyes, yawning.</p>
    <p>"Almost there," Court said, a queer breathlessness in his voice. "Just over this rise. Hold on!"</p>
    <p>A glowing shadow had loomed up sinisterly before the car, blocking the road. It was a Carrier, silent, motionless, menacing.</p>
    <p>Court made a swift decision. He could drive straight at the thing. But that was too long a chance. Going so fast, though, he had little choice.</p>
    <p>He jammed on the brake, at the same time twisting the wheel. The car's tires rasped and screamed as the vehicle slid sideward. It rolled ominously on two wheels, righted itself, and plunged off the road.</p>
    <p>The occupants were jolted and flung about as the sedan lurched across a plowed field. A tire blew out with a deafening report. Desperately Court fought the wheel.</p>
    <p>Bang!--Another tire had gone, but Court jammed his foot on the accelerator. In the rear mirror, he could see that the Carrier was still standing in the same place. It was not pursuing them.</p>
    <p>He got the car back on the road, picked up speed. As it limped on, the Carrier was left behind. Court drew a deep breath.</p>
    <p>"Gods!" Scipio bellowed. "I almost stabbed myself with this blade!"</p>
    <p>Li Yang gurgled with amusement. "You are not as well padded as I. But I am glad our journey is almost over. It is, is it not, Court?"</p>
    <p>"Yes. This is home--"</p>
    <p>Court's voice died away as he jerked the car to a halt. They were at the huge, rambling structure that had housed the laboratory. The building was gone. It had been razed to the ground in an irregular splotch of blackly charred ruin. A crater yawned among the debris.</p>
    <p>The laboratory was destroyed, and with it, the chance to save the Earth!</p>
    <p>Sick hopelessness was so strong in Court that for a long, dreadful moment his heart was numb. He seemed to be disassociated from his body. As if he were a distant onlooker, he stared at the sharp clarity of the ruins under the Moon. His shadow stretched out before him on the ochre pathway. On one side was the taller shadow of Scipio. On the other was the obese dark blotch thrown by Li Yang's form. The grasses rustled dryly in the cool night wind.</p>
    <p>The embers were still warm, for smoke coiled up lazily from the dying coals. Apparently the work of destruction had occurred lately. Was it an accident?</p>
    <p>No Thordred must be responsible! Court might have expected this. When Thordred acquired his memory pattern, he had also become familiar with the laboratory and all its potentialities. Naturally he would wish to destroy it, lest use of its powers be used against him.</p>
    <p>But why had he waited two whole weeks? Perhaps because he had not been able to locate the laboratory till now. Despite having acquired Court's memories, Thordred was a stranger in this new, complicated civilization.</p>
    <p>"Steve!"</p>
    <p>The scream cut through the air bringing Court around sharply. It was Marion's voice!</p>

     <p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>
     <p>Marion</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>The cry had come from the hillside beyond the house. For a second, Stephen caught the glimpse of a white figure running toward him in the bright moonlight.</p>
    <p>He raced to meet the girl. She collapsed in his arms, panting and disheveled. Her hair was a tumbled brown mass of ringlets. For several minutes she could only gasp inarticulately.</p>
    <p>"Steve, thank God you're safe--I saw the headlights of a car--but I didn't know it was you--but I thought if you were alive--you'd come back to the lab--"</p>
    <p>Looking down into her eyes, Court felt a queer tightness in his throat. He interrupted in a voice that was scarcely audible.</p>
    <p>"Marion, I--I love you."</p>
    <p>The girl caught her breath as she stared. Then suddenly she smiled with dazzling brilliance.</p>
    <p>"'I'm glad," she whispered, and pressed her head against Court's chest. "I'm glad you're human, after all."</p>
    <p>Yes, Court thought to himself, he was human. For years he had refused to admit it.</p>
    <p>But now--a chuckle started behind his lips--he gloried in it!</p>
    <p>The others came running up, staring at Marion. She drew away from Court.</p>
    <p>"Thordred wrecked the lab," she explained. "Who are these men?"</p>
    <p>She eyed them inquisitively.</p>
    <p>"No time for introductions now," Court snapped. "Tell me what's happened. You've seen Thordred, or you wouldn't know his name."</p>
    <p>She nodded. "He came here two hours ago and destroyed the house. I was the only one who got out alive. I saw the ship not far away. When I started to run, a beam of light flashed out and I was paralyzed! A huge bearded man came running and carried me into the ship. He seemed to know who I was."</p>
    <p>"Of course," Court agreed. "He acquired all my memories with his damned machine."</p>
    <p>"There was a girl called Jansaiya. She didn't say anything. She just watched. Thordred showed me dozens of men and women in the ship, asleep, cataleptic. He said he had captured them to start a new civilization. He was going to another planet--and he'd decided to take me, too. Since I'd been your assistant, Steve, he figured I'd be a good assistant for him. My scientific training would be invaluable to him. He told me you were dead, that he'd killed you with a ray in New York."</p>
    <p>"So he thinks I'm dead," Court observed. "That means he didn't know the ray only paralyzed me."</p>
    <p>Marion didn't look at him as she continued.</p>
    <p>"I pretended to fall in with Thordred's wishes, said I'd go with him. So he didn't bother to put me into catalepsy. He started the motors and the ship began to rise. Then I--I--"</p>
    <p>"Go on," Court said gently.</p>
    <p>"He wasn't watching me. I saw what he was doing at the instrument panel, and I jumped at it. Somehow I pushed all the levers and buttons before he grabbed me. The ship crashed. I wanted to kill Thordred, Steve, because I thought he'd killed you. If you were dead, I didn't want to keep on living."</p>
    <p>For answer, Court drew the girl closer. She went on talking hurriedly.</p>
    <p>"The ship was wrecked completely. It's right over the ridge. All the prisoners were killed, and Jansaiya was hurt. I tried to help her, but Thordred dragged me away. I don't know how he got me out alive. He was like a madman. He salvaged some weapons from the wreck, and made me go with him-- I don't know why, or what he intended. I think he wanted to kill me later, Steve. Slowly!"</p>
    <p>Court's face was chalk-white. Clipping his words, he gave his orders.</p>
    <p>"Let's find the ship. We may be able to salvage something, too. Li Yang, Scipio, watch out for Thordred, though I don't think he'll bother us now."</p>
    <p>The four mounted the slope. At the top of the ridge they halted. In the valley before them lay the vast golden bulk of the space ship, near a streamlet that made a winding ribbon of quick-silver between its banks. There was no sign of life near the vessel.</p>
    <p>They descended the slope. Suddenly Marion cried out softly and gripped Court's arm. The four halted abruptly.</p>
    <p>A shining oval drifted into view from behind a bush. It was a Carrier, a glowing fog, fading toward its edges into invisibility. With more than human speed, it moved toward the group.</p>
    <p>Court instinctively thrust the girl behind him. Scipio lifted his hard fist in futile defiance. Then he remembered the saber and drew it.</p>
    <p>But there was no defense against a Carrier, Court knew. He opened his mouth to shout a command to flee. But for some reason that he could not define, he waited.</p>
    <p>The shining thing had halted. It was motionless, and Court was conscious of an intent regard. The creature was watching him. Why? Such a thing had never happened before. Always the Carrier had leaped eagerly, avidly, upon then-prey. Why did this horror wait?</p>
    <p>Court inexplicably felt something stir and move in his brain. Briefly the image of old Sammy, with his brown, wrinkled face and his mop of white hair, rose up vividly in his mind. Behind him, Marion's voice whispered like a prayer.</p>
    <p>"Sammy!"</p>
    <p>The shining thing seemed to hear. It hesitated and drew back. Suddenly it turned, speeding up the slope, and vanished over the ridge.</p>
    <p>"Good God!" Court whispered through dry lips. "Marion, do you think that was--Sammy?"</p>
    <p>White-faced, the girl nodded.</p>
    <p>"Yes, Steve. And I think he knew us, remembered us. That's why--" She could not go on.</p>
    <p>"Well," Scipio broke in roughly, "why do we wait? Let's go on."</p>
    <p>In silence, Court led the way down the slope. Presently he shivered a little, and Marion glanced sharply at him.</p>
    <p>"Do you feel that, too?"</p>
    <p>"What? Wait a minute, yes. Some radiation--"</p>
    <p>"There!" Li Yang said, pointing.</p>
    <p>Court followed the gesture, saw the spot of light.</p>
    <p>Blazing like the heart of a blue sun, flaming with a fierce and terrible radiance, the light-speck glowed upon the hull of the ship. Instantly Court guessed what it was. The atomic energy that powered the huge motors had broken free. No longer prisoned by its guarding, resistant sheath, it was sending its powerful vibrations out like ripples widening on a pool.</p>
    <p>"Don't go any closer!" Court clutched Scipio's arm, halting him. "That's dangerous. It can fry us to a crisp."</p>
    <p>"Gods!" The Carthaginian stared. "Is that true? A mere glow of light?"</p>
    <p>In theory Court knew something of atomic energy, though it had never been achieved practically on earth. In the old days, men had feared that unleashed atomic energy would destroy the whole planet, its fiery breath spreading swiftly like a poisonous infection. But Court knew there was no danger of that. The rate of matter-consumption was far too slow. In a thousand years, the valley might be eaten away, but not in five years or five minutes.</p>
    <p>"Scipio!"</p>
    <p>The faint cry came from nearby, startling them. The Carthaginian's hand flew to his sword as he whispered.</p>
    <p>"Jansaiya!"</p>
    <p>And again came the cry, plaintive, gull-sweet, infinitely sad.</p>
    <p>"Help me!"</p>
    <p>With a muttered oath, Scipio whirled and ran. Court followed at his heels. A mound of bushes clustered a hundred feet away, and in its shelter lay Jansaiya. The fading moonlight washed her hair with gold.</p>
    <p>She lay broken, dying. . . .</p>
    <p>"Jansaiya," Scipio said tonelessly.</p>
    <p>He dropped to his knees beside the girl and lifted her in his mighty arms. With a tired sigh, she let her head fall on his bronzed shoulder.</p>
    <p>"My--my back--"</p>
    <p>After Court completed a hasty examination, his eyes met Scipio's. He did not need to speak, for the Carthaginian nodded slowly. Jansaiya's torn gown and bruised limbs told how she had dragged herself toward safety.</p>
    <p>"Thordred left you?" Scipio asked in a queer, hoarse voice.</p>
    <p>The strangely beautiful green eyes misted with pain as she held herself close to Scipio's barrel chest. The Carthaginian's gargoyle face was the color and hardness of granite in the moonlight.</p>
    <p>"I--I think--I might have loved you--warrior," Jansaiya murmured.</p>
    <p>Then she sobbed restrainedly with unbearable agony. The golden lashes drooped to shield the sea-green eyes. The tender lips scarcely moved as the girl whispered.</p>
    <p>"There was not ever--any pain--in old Atlantis--"</p>
    <p>Her head drooped on his arm and was motionless. . . .</p>
    <p>Gently Scipio laid her in the shelter of the bushes. He touched her hair, her eyes, then tenderly he touched his lips to those red, silent ones, from which even the faint hint of cruelty had gone.</p>
    <p>As he drew back, the last glow of the sinking Moon failed. The eternal dark accepted Jansaiya and shrouded her.</p>
    <p>The starlight was cold as glittering ice on Scipio's savage eyes as he rose. He stood towering there, motionless, staring at nothingness. Slowly he turned to face the west.</p>
    <p>"Court," he rumbled distantly, "you heard her?"</p>
    <p>"Yes," Court said in a low, tense voice.</p>
    <p>"He left her to die. . . ."</p>
    <p>Abruptly the Carthaginian's face was that of a blood-ravening demon. The mighty hands flexed into talons.</p>
    <p>"He is mine to slay!" Scipio breathed through flaring nostrils. "Remember that-- He is mine to slay!"</p>
    <p>But Jansaiya could no longer hear. She lay limp, slim and lovely and forever untouchable now, shielded from all hurt. She slept as a child might sleep.</p>
    <p>"You wish to kill me?" a harsh voice asked mockingly. "Well, I am waiting, Scipio."</p>
    <p>From the shadows of the bushes, Thordred's giant form rose into view.</p>
    <p>Startled bewilderment momentarily paralyzed Court. He cursed himself for a fool. He might have expected this, but finding Jansaiya had made him relax his vigilance. Glaring at Thordred, he stepped aside to stand in front of Marion.</p>
    <p>Li Yang's fat yellow face was expressionless.</p>
    <p>Scipio, after one hoarse oath, had drawn his saber. He was walking forward, his eyes burning with blood-hunger.</p>
    <p>Thordred's hand dipped into his garments, came up holding a lens-shaped crystal that shot forth a spear of green light.</p>
    <p>It touched Scipio. The Carthaginian halted in mid-stride with the saber lifted, a grin of fury frozen on the gargoyle face.</p>
    <p>Court leaped for Thordred, but the green ray caught him, too. The life was drained from him in a shock of icy cold. He stood motionless, paralyzed as the ray darted aside.</p>
    <p>From the corner of his eye, Court saw Marion and Li Yang stiffen into immobility. The four stood helpless, while Thordred tossed his crystal from hand to hand and grinned.</p>
    <p>"You fools!" his harsh voice grated. "So I did not kill you that other time, did I, Court? Well, I shall rectify that omission now. If not for the interference of all of you, I should never have lost the ship. Yet I can still have my vengeance."</p>
    <p>He glanced down significantly at the lens he held.</p>
    <p>"You shall die slowly, in the utmost agony. You shall burn gradually as I increase the strength of the ray. After that, I do not know what I shall do. Perhaps I can build another space ship. The knowledge I have stolen should enable me to do that. But that comes after my revenge."</p>
    <p>The bearded face was murderous in the moonlight. The crystal flashed a ray that struck Court on the chest. The green light turned yellow. Simultaneously blinding pain racked the man. He smelled the odor of his own burning flesh.</p>
    <p>"You shall die," Thordred gritted. "All of you. This is my vengeance."</p>

     <p>CHAPTER XVIII.</p>
     <p>The Man Who Lived Again</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>When Thordred placed Ardath's body in the small space ship and sent it hurtling toward the Sun, he had thought the Kyrian dead. His fear of Ardath's giant intellect had been so great that he would feel safe only when the solar inferno had utterly consumed it. Yet by making doubly sure that his former master would meet death, Thordred had committed a serious error.</p>
    <p>For Ardath was not dead. He awoke slowly, painfully, only vaguely conscious of his surroundings. For a time he lay quietly, blinking and striving to understand. He kept his eyes closed after a single glance at a dazzling glare.</p>
    <p>He turned his head away from the bright light and reopened his eyes. His gaze took in his surroundings. He was in a space ship, a small one that was unfamiliar to him. Through the ports in the walls showed the starlit blackness of interplanetary space.</p>
    <p>He was incredibly weak. He sat up, massaging his limbs until his numbed circulation was restored to normal. Then he rose with a great effort and looked around.</p>
    <p>Sunlight flamed through a row of ports. Ardath instantly realized that he was falling directly into the rapidly enlarging Sun. He saw the controls, sprang toward them, almost collapsing in his weakness.</p>
    <p>He examined the unfamiliar apparatus, tentatively fingering the panel. Presently the puzzle of strangeness was solved in his amazingly swift mind. He tried a lever, then another, and knew that he was master of the unknown ship. The vital problem just now was to escape from the Sun's attraction.</p>
    <p>Luckily he was not yet even close to the chromosphere. He turned the vessel in a wide arc. After staring through the ports, he aimed its nose at the Earth. Then he locked the controls and searched for food.</p>
    <p>Foreseeing emergencies, Court had stocked the little ship well. Much of the food was unfamiliar to Ardath, but he sampled it intelligently. Brandy stimulated him and gave him strength. As he ate, he pondered the situation.</p>
    <p>How had he got here? What had awakened him from his cataleptic sleep? The last thing he remembered was emerging from the laboratory in his own ship, to encounter Thordred's ruthless blow. The bearded giant had betrayed him, but how long ago had that been? How long had Ardath slept? During his last period of awakening, he had arranged an automatic alarm which would react to the presence of any unusual mentality existing on Earth. Ardath wished to take no chances of sleeping past the lifetimes of geniuses. But he had not had time to set that alarm before Thordred stunned him. Everyone in the golden ship should have slept on until infinity, unless awakened by some outside force. What had that been?</p>
    <p>Again Ardath went to a port and studied the constellations, noting the changes that time had made. He computed roughly that at least twenty centuries had elapsed since his last awakening. Perhaps, through his failure to set the automatic alarm, he had already slept through the lifetimes of innumerable super-mentalities.</p>
    <p>Though Ardath did not know it, of course, he had not awakened to find Moses, Confucius, Socrates, Galileo, Newton, and a dozen others. The alarm, had it been set, would have aroused him when those men appeared on Earth.</p>
    <p>Ardath glanced thoughtfully toward the Sun. Its powerful rays, unshielded by any atmosphere, had awakened him. He felt gratitude to the unknown builder of this ship, who had installed transparent ports, through which the vital radiations had poured. If the vessel had been on any other course, Ardath might have slept on to the end of time. But the Sun's rays had destroyed the artificial catalepsy.</p>
    <p>Ardath rose and began to search the little ship. Its architecture was obviously Terrestrial, the natural development of art-forms he had seen in ancient days on Earth. Moreover, the use of Earth metals in the construction, and the absence of any unusual ones, confirmed this theory.</p>
    <p>Certain equipment that Ardath found interested him. The mystery of a blowtorch he solved without difficulty. An electromagnet and vials of acids made him nod thoughtfully. When he measured one of the ports carefully, he realized that it coincided exactly with the size and shape of the entry-ports on his own ship.</p>
    <p>The equipment indicated that the unknown owner of this little vessel had expected to find a barrier difficult to pass. The curious similarity of the ports on both ships added up to an unescapable conclusion. Someone on Earth had built this ship in order to reach and enter Ardath's craft. Obviously he had succeeded, but without the use of atomic energy.</p>
    <p>He had duplicated the alloy that coated the hull of the Kyrian vessel, yet the energy was electrical in nature. Ardath's race had used electricity once, so many eons ago that it was mere legend when he had been born. Atomic energy had supplanted it. Yet Ardath must work with the tools at hand.</p>
    <p>He found himself experiencing difficulty in breathing. The air supply, of course, had not bothered him during his cataleptic state, but now it was becoming a problem. He examined the air-renewers and purifiers, found them simple but effective.</p>
    <p>Luckily there were the necessary chemicals aboard the ship to renew the exhausted apparatus. The names on the containers meant nothing to Ardath, but the chemicals were easily recognizable. In only one case did he find a test necessary.</p>
    <p>It would be a long journey back to Earth. Meanwhile, Ardath examined some maps and charts that had been in a cupboard, as well as a popular novel which one of the workmen who built the ship had left in a corner and forgotten. These would be invaluable for learning the language. Since Ardath already knew Latin from his last period of awakening, he could learn English without too much difficulty. He could even approximate the present pronunciation, once he understood the letters--like w--which Romans did not have. The luckiest find of all, after that, was a newspaper.</p>
    <p>Two problems faced Ardath-- He must find his own ship, and he needed a weapon. Painstakingly he analyzed the situation.</p>
    <p>Day after day dragged on while the space ship fled toward Earth. The Kyrian studied the charts, the book, and the newspaper, striving to understand. From a rubber stamp on the maps, he learned that the owner of the vessel was named Stephen Court, and that he lived in Wisconsin, near a town which Ardath finally located on one of the charts.</p>
    <p>That became his destination. The Kyrian's keen understanding of psychology aided him in understanding what had happened during his unconsciousness. Placing himself in the respective positions of Thordred and Stephen Court, he applied rules of logic.</p>
    <p>When Court had entered the golden space ship and found the cataleptic bodies, he would naturally have tried to awaken them. When he awoke Thordred, what had happened?</p>
    <p>There were two possibilities. Thordred, Ardath realized now, wanted power above all else. He had resented the Kyrian's domination. After apparently succeeding in killing his former master, he would not have been willing to obey Court. Rather, his lust for power would have been given fresh fuel.</p>
    <p>He and Court would have become either enemies or friends. In the latter case, Ardath now faced two opponents. But why should Court, having built this ingenious and expensive space ship, have been willing to destroy it by aiming it at the Sun? He would naturally have wished to retain it for later use. A logical man does not destroy valuable equipment, and only a logical and intelligent person could have built this vessel.</p>
    <p>But Thordred, on the other hand, would have wished the smaller ship destroyed, so that he would possess the only space ship on Earth. Such tactics would strengthen his power. Unless there were already other spacecraft in existence. . . .</p>
    <p>That was impossible. This one was obviously patterned on Ardath's own vessel. A man with sufficient knowledge to create it would have used it, first of all, to visit the original ship. That sounded logical, though not entirely certain.</p>
    <p>Court would probably have resented the destruction of his property. That indicated that he and Thordred were enemies. But from that conclusion, Ardath could go no further. He could only wait until he had reached the Earth and visited the home of Stephen Court in Wisconsin. If Court lived, he would certainly be an ally.</p>
    <p>And now Ardath concentrated on creating a weapon. Equipment was at hand, and electricity. Atomic energy Ardath could not manufacture at present, but he thought it would not be necessary. Already he had a plan for a weapon in mind.</p>
    <p>It must be able to convey a strong shock, or even a fatal one, over quite a distance. That necessitated some conductor of the current. A jet of water--a thin spray, perhaps--might do the trick. But the use of ordinary water was not quite satisfactory.</p>
    <p>Ardath began to experiment with the limited laboratory he had at his command. He worked arduously, sleeping and eating only when he found time, while the ship sped toward its destination.</p>
    <p>Earth grew from a star to a spinning globe, cloud-sheathed, and then into a vast concave disk that blotted out the starry void. Ardath found the outline of North America, checked it with his maps. Then he sent the vessel arrowing toward Lake Michigan, which was visible even from beyond the atmosphere.</p>
    <p>It was night before he landed outside the village near Court's home. He lowered the ship silently among concealing trees and slipped toward the lights of the settlement.</p>
    <p>His clothing would arouse curiosity, he realized, but that could not be helped. Taking his new weapon, which was awkwardly bulky, he moved forward.</p>
    <p>Luck was with him. A youth, idling along the highway in a dim stretch, paused to stare at Ardath. The Kyrian took advantage of the opportunity. Mouthing the unfamiliar words carefully, he asked:</p>
    <p>"Can you say where Stephen Court lives?" It sounded like: Can yoh-uh say vhere Stephen Coo-urt liv-es?" The boy blinked.</p>
    <p>"Sure. You're a foreigner, ain't you?"</p>
    <p>When no answer came, he went on, pointing.</p>
    <p>"Right up the road there." He gave explicit directions. "But I wouldn't go up there if I was you. There was a fire up there just a little while ago, and folks saw some funny kind of airship hanging around. They think it crashed in the valley behind the house, but nobody's gone to look. We stay away from Court's place since he had a case of the Plague there."</p>
    <p>Without a word, Ardath left the lad and hurried on. He had understood most of what had been said. "A funny kind of airship?" Could that be the golden space vessel? By the gods, if it had crashed--</p>
    <p>The ruins of the house told their own story. Ardath hesitated, then skirted it to climb up the slope beyond the charred foundations.</p>
    <p>"The valley behind the house," the boy had said. Ardath topped the ridge. His thin, patrician face went cold as marble at the sight before him. The ship was wrecked, he saw at a glance. And he saw, too, the moonlit figures of huge Thordred and his paralyzed prisoners.</p>
    <p>As the ray flashed out from the lens in Thordred's hand, Ardath ran swiftly down the slope, concealing himself amid the bushes. As an odor of charred flesh came to his nostrils, his eyes were suddenly remorseless as death.</p>
    <p>At last he was close enough. He rose from the shadows and called softly:</p>
    <p>"Thordred!"</p>
    <p>The bearded giant whirled, shocked amazement in the amber eyes. The yellow ray swung wide, out of his control. Simultaneously Ardath lifted the weapon he held, and a thin jet of fluid shot from its muzzle, splashing on Thordred's arm. The giant yelled in agony, and his lens fell to the ground.</p>
    <p>"You betrayed me, Thordred," Ardath said motionlessly. "It is just that you die."</p>
    <p>He stepped forward. The huge, bearded figure swayed and writhed in agony, striving to break free from the invisible grip that held it. Ardath's foot slipped on a rounded stone. For a second, the liquid jet wavered from its mark. But swept back swiftly--</p>
    <p>Thordred was gone! He flung himself back into the shelter of the bushes. The crashing of underbrush told of his flight.</p>
    <p>Ardath shrugged and lowered his weapon.</p>
    <p>"He is harmless now," he said, and bent to pick up the lens. Briefly he eyed the three men and the girl, still paralyzed. "Scipio, Li Yang, and two strangers."</p>
    <p>He made a hasty adjustment on the crystal, sent a blue glow sweeping out to bathe the four. The paralysis fled.</p>
    <p>"Ardath!" Li Yang said. "You came in good time."</p>
    <p>"By the gods, yes!" Scipio roared. His voice went soft with regret. "Though not in time to save Jansaiya." His eyes clouded. Lifting his saber, he plunged forward. "I'll be back with Thordred's head," he promised over his shoulder, and vanished into the woods.</p>
    <p>"You--you're Ardath?" Court asked.</p>
    <p>The burn on his chest was aching painfully, but it was not deep, and it had been automatically cauterized. He stared at the rescuer. The Kyrian nodded.</p>
    <p>"I am Ardath. You seem to know of me. Are you Stephen Court?"</p>
    <p>"Yes. But how did you learn English? How did you escape from the Sun trap? What--"</p>
    <p>"Wait." Ardath was staring down at the wrecked ship. "Before all else, the atomic energy must be prisoned again. It is"--he fumbled for the right word--"dangerous. To approach it closely means death."</p>
    <p>"Lead?" Court suggested.</p>
    <p>When Ardath looked puzzled, he gave the atomic number.</p>
    <p>"Only a special alloy will insulate the rays of atomic energy. Do you see that container? It looks like a speck from here, beside the spot of light. Only that can hold the power." He frowned. "The power must be placed in its sheath again. But--"</p>
    <p>"It means death," Li Yang broke in. "Very well. I shall do it."</p>
    <p>Court clutched the fat arm.</p>
    <p>"You need not sacrifice yourself."</p>
    <p>Ardath's face was expressionless as he went on in his painful, stilted English.</p>
    <p>"Whoever goes must be quick. The rays kill swiftly. Hurry to the ship, slide the container over the little globe of atomic energy, and put the cover in place. That is all. After that, it will be safe to approach."</p>
    <p>"Steve," Marion said unsteadily, "let me go."</p>
    <p>"No!" Court's arm went around the girl, drawing her close. "Not you. Do we need to make this sacrifice, Ardath?"</p>
    <p>The Kyrian nodded, sorrowfully.</p>
    <p>"The energy will spread out till it touches ores. Then it will expand faster, until the Earth itself will be destroyed."</p>
    <p>There was a sudden interruption. From the bushes behind the group, a glowing nimbus of light drifted. It was a Carrier, but it did not approach the three. Instead, it sped down the slope, toward the ship. Ardath stared.</p>
    <p>"Marion, do you suppose--" Court said hoarsely.</p>
    <p>"Maybe, Steve. If that was Sammy, he may have heard us."</p>
    <p>They watched as the weird Carrier fled toward the ship. It reached the hull, bent over and picked up a small object from the ground. It made a swift motion--and the glare of atomic energy vanished!</p>
    <p>"He did hear us," Court exulted. "Good old Sammy!"</p>
    <p>The light nimbus was drifting away toward the other side of the valley. Presently it was hidden from sight, but before that Ardath was striding down to the ship.</p>
    <p>He returned, holding in his hands an oval container of dark, lustrous metal. It was the sheath for the atomic energy.</p>
    <p>"We have much to talk about," he said to Court. "Your language--I must master it better."</p>
    <p>Scipio came back, cursing and swinging his saber. His deep chest rose and fell as he panted.</p>
    <p>"Thordred got away. I could not catch him."</p>
    <p>Court took immediate command.</p>
    <p>"Back to the road. There's plenty of room in the car. We'll head directly for Washington and make plans. I think you can help us against the Plague, Ardath. Your atomic energy has already given me an idea."</p>
    <p>"The Plague?" Ardath asked. "I'll help, if I can. But I am sorry you did not destroy Thordred, Scipio. I fear he will trouble us again."</p>
    <p>The Carthaginian did not answer. He grinned unpleasantly, fingering the saber-blade, as he followed the others back toward the ridge.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>
     <p>The Earth Shield</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Two weeks later found Court haggard and red-eyed with exhaustion. He and Ardath, aided by Li Yang, Scipio and Marion, had been working day and night, experimenting, testing, discarding. Court's task had been complicated by the difficulty of securing the Government's backing. The President, though in favor of Court's proposal, would not give his consent until the country's foremost scientists had approved.</p>
    <p>"They still don't realize what we're up against," Court told Marion.</p>
    <p>The two were walking toward a huge white auditorium on Pennsylvania Avenue. The dome of the Capitol loomed against the blue sky. A number of cars were drawn up before the marble building.</p>
    <p>"But they know what the Plague's doing," Marion said worriedly. "New cases every day!"</p>
    <p>"I know. Perhaps I shouldn't have asked for as much money as I did, yet we'll need it all. Small weapons aren't enough. We've got to build the Shield to save Earth."</p>
    <p>"Well, today's the day," she mused. "All the scientists will be there, with lots of Army officials and Washington bigwigs."</p>
    <p>Court smiled. "Yes. I hope--"</p>
    <p>He turned into an alcove and picked up a phone. Presently he asked:</p>
    <p>"Scipio? All set? Good. Be careful, now." He turned back to Marion. "This may be dangerous, but I think it'll do the trick."</p>
    <p>Before long, he was on the stage of the auditorium, a lithe, well built figure against a background of sable curtains. The room was nearly filled with a crowd of men--scientists, uniformed Army men, politicians. A rustle of expectancy went through them as Court appeared. Without preamble he began:</p>
    <p>"I am going to ask you to witness--" He paused as reporters' flashlight bulbs popped and glared. "All right, boys. Save some of your plates till later. You will need them. To resume, I am going to perform an experiment for you today. Most of you are already familiar with my proposal. I have found a cure for the Plague, but it is an expensive one. On the other hand, it is the only possible way to save the human race from extinction."</p>
    <p>"Bunk!" a voice yelled. "Prove it!"</p>
    <p>Court lifted his hand.</p>
    <p>"One moment You have all read about Ardath. Some of you, I think, have seen my colleague. His strange history has become familiar to you. Let me introduce him now."</p>
    <p>Ardath walked out on the platform. His antique clothing had been replaced by a well fitting suit of light flannels, and his slim figure went over to stand beside Court. The lean, patrician face looked out over the audience without expression.</p>
    <p>"Fake!" a cry arose. It was echoed by others. A gray-haired man stood up.</p>
    <p>"If you've found a cure for the Plague, prove it. This Ardath may be an impostor. He probably is. He has nothing to do with--"</p>
    <p>Ardath did not say a word, but he stepped forward a pace. Something in the look of the strange, alien eyes brought silence to the auditorium. In the stillness, Court spoke again.</p>
    <p>"You know that the Plague is fatal. To touch a Carrier is instant death. That there is no possible insulation. I have already given my theories about the origin of the Plague. It is sheer life energy--the ultimate evolution of all life, the residuum of some immeasurably ancient universe that evolved into pure energy perhaps eons ago. This cosmic cloud of energy has drifted through the interstellar void until its edges infringe upon the Earth.</p>
    <p>"Some catalyst in our atmosphere made it potent, infected our Me forms with this strange virus. What the Plague does is simply this--it speeds up entropy. And the evolution that takes place is abnormal, against nature."</p>
    <p>Court paused, drew a deep breath, and resumed.</p>
    <p>"Normal evolution is slow. Mankind automatically adjusts itself to different environments through the course of ages. But this is a sudden jump to the ultimate life form, which in the normal course of events should not exist in this System for billions of years. That disrupts the evolutionary check-and-balance system. Humanity is not yet ready for this metamorphosis. It must come slowly and gradually, over a period of millions of years. Let me sketch for you the future.</p>
    <p>"More and more of the Carriers will appear as Earth plunges deeper into the heart of the cloud of life energy. The Carriers will feed on those who were once their fellows. Eventually only they will exist on this planet, and even they will die in the end for lack of sustenance. In less than fifty years, the world will be a barren, dead sphere drifting through space. That is what it might have been, had we not found a cure!"</p>
    <p>Then the Kyrian's clipped, precise voice rang through the auditorium.</p>
    <p>"Court speaks truly. You men of this civilization are strange to me. Perhaps few of you believe the story of my origin. That does not matter. Working together, Court and I have discovered the nature of the Plague and found a solution. It is this-- The Carriers are forms of Me energy. They can be destroyed, but only by creating a stronger type of energy which will drain their own. Only one thing will do that--atomic power.</p>
    <p>"A certain Carrier came in touch with the unguarded atomic power in my space ship. Later, we searched for him, and found his body near the vessel. Exposure to the terrific energy had killed him."</p>
    <p>Court nodded, remembering how he and Ardath had hunted through the Wisconsin hills for Sammy, and the burned, inhuman thing they had found at last. The Kyrian went on.</p>
    <p>"Atomic power short-circuits the Carriers, drains their energy. Already we have constructed portable weapons which are thoroughly satisfactory."</p>
    <p>"But the life-cloud in space!" a voice from the audience broke in. "You can't destroy that!"</p>
    <p>The Kyrian smiled grimly.</p>
    <p>"True. And more and more Carriers will appear as we approach the nucleus of the cloud. But we can protect the Earth, create a wall around it, a shell of atomic energy! With the right machines, we can transform the Heaviside Layer into a shield that will perfectly insulate this planet against the cosmic cloud. Solar radiation will still come through unchecked. But not a trace of the deadly life energy will be able to penetrate the Shield."</p>
    <p>A low murmuring in the auditorium grew into a roar. Men rose and shouted questions, challenges at Ardath. A shield around the Earth? Ridiculous! Such fantastic pipe-dreams belonged with perpetual motion and other exploded theories. Ardath glanced wryly at Court.</p>
    <p>"Well, I see I can't convince them. Shall we--"</p>
    <p>Court was waving his arms, trying to quiet the crowd. His attempts were useless. Already some of the audience were rising and heading for the exits.</p>
    <p>No one saw Court wave toward the wings. But all eyes turned to the stage when the black curtain rustled apart. Simultaneously a gasp of sheer horror ripped from hundreds of throats.</p>
    <p>On the platform was--a Carrier!</p>
    <p>A huge box of luminous metal stood just behind it, in which the horror had apparently been confined. It was open now, and the luminous fog that constituted the Carrier was drifting forward with purposeful intent.</p>
    <p>Ardath and Court had raced to one side of the stage. Scipio appeared, wheeling a small contrivance no larger than a dictaphone. A conical tube topped it, ending in a translucent lens.</p>
    <p>"Good," Court snapped at the Carthaginian. "But for God's sake, be careful now!"</p>
    <p>The giant nodded with a flash of white teeth. Court turned to the paralyzed audience.</p>
    <p>"Stay where you are! There's no danger, unless you get hysterical and riot."</p>
    <p>A uniformed man in the aisle shouted an oath and whipped out his revolver. He pumped bullets at the glowing creature. Naturally there was no result. Court waited till the echoes had died.</p>
    <p>"No one will deny that this is an authentic Carrier. Watch!"</p>
    <p>The creature was at the edge of the platform when Scipio swung his weapon to focus upon it. The result was unspectacular. A ray of intense white light struck from the lens, and the glow surrounding the Carrier merely began to fade. The thing remained motionless, all its glory dulling.</p>
    <p>At last there was only something hike a mummy collapsing to lie motionless on the stage. Scipio switched off the light.</p>
    <p>"Take your seats, please," Court said. "I have no more surprises for you. I shall welcome a committee to examine the body of this Carrier." The first man to hasten down the aisle was a strongly built, handsome man with grizzled gray hair. He went directly to Court.</p>
    <p>"Mr. President!" Court cried. "I didn't know you intended to be here, or I wouldn't have--"</p>
    <p>"I'm glad you did make that experiment," said the President of the United States. "I doubt if the scientists will fail to approve your plan now." There was a little twinkle in the level gray eyes. "Even if they do, I have authority under martial law to order you to build your Earth Shield, and to give you every assistance you require."</p>
    <p>The big figure turned toward the audience, and the President waved at the group of reporters.</p>
    <p>"Put that on your front pages, boys. Stephen Court's in charge!"</p>
    <p>With silent, incredible speed, Earth swung into action to fight the cosmic menace. Stephen Court was in charge. Beside him Ardath worked, untiring, unsparing of himself. Li Yang, Scipio, and Marion Barton lent their aid.</p>
    <p>Staffs of trained scientists gathered from all over the world. Factories were hastily commandeered, and their machinery altered so they could turn out quantities of the atomic energy portable guns.</p>
    <p>From San Francisco, to New York, from New Orleans to Chicago, trained men went busily to work. Production of the guns was left to subordinates. Once provided with the plans, they executed their orders with swift precision.</p>
    <p>Troops of militia were armed with the weapons and sent into Plague-infested areas. New York was cleared of the Carriers, and the other cities as well. Dozens of the guns were stored in airports, ready for instant transportation whenever a case of the Plague was reported. Such reports were constant these days. Earth was approaching dangerously close to the nucleus of the cosmic cloud.</p>
    <p>Ardath flew to China, with Li Yang and two hundred famous scientists. A job had to be done there. Two gigantic towers had to be erected, on each side of the Earth--one in the Orient, one in America. Court was in charge of constructing the latter. He remained in constant telephonic communication with Ardath.</p>
    <p>Speed was essential. Every resource of the country was turned to building the Earth Shield. Business was neglected. The Government issued their orders, delegating certain jobs to certain groups. The people had to be fed, of course, but every capable man was mustered to the task for which he was best fitted. Factories worked day and night.</p>
    <p>Every other country lent its aid. Canada, England, Germany, France, Italy, Japan--all forgot their imperialistic and trade quarrels in order to battle the common enemy. There was no time for war.</p>
    <p>Build the Towers! Create the Earth Shield! These aims were foremost.</p>
    <p>Slowly the mighty obelisks rose. They resembled the Eiffel Tower, but were far taller and larger. Immense girders buckled huger beams together as the monoliths rose against the sky day by day. Faster, faster, the men worked.</p>
    <p>At night, searchlights were used. New roads were built and old ones widened, all converging on the Towers. A railroad was laid to each one from the nearest line.</p>
    <p>Nearby towns found themselves incredibly augmented in populations. Emergency barracks rose. Dapper physicists and chemists slept side by side with burly roustabouts and riveters.</p>
    <p>No thought of class, and few quarrels, arose. Each man knew that the Plague might strike his own family next. Under his breath he whispered:</p>
    <p>"Build the Earth Shield! Hurry! Hurry!"</p>
    <p>Two Towers loomed at last, visible for many miles. Each one was topped with a shimmering, bright sphere of metal, fifty feet in diameter. From these globes the atomic energy would flame out, to encircle the planet and transform the atomic structure of the Heaviside Layer into an impregnable barrier.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER XX.</p>
     <p>Thordred Returns</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Court had little time to rest. He had frequent reports from the Chief of the F.B.I., whom he had requested to track down the vanished Thordred. But the bearded giant had disappeared without trace. His continued presence meant danger, however. Thordred possessed the knowledge he had stolen from the minds of both Ardath and Court. The drag-net searched for him vainly.</p>
    <p>One night Court, Scipio and Marion stood in the control room just beneath the huge globe that topped the Tower. The task was finished. The last workman had just departed in the elevator that led to the ground. The three stood quietly, staring out at the land that stretched far beneath them. Bright moonlight bathed everything weirdly, yet beautifully.</p>
    <p>The room was fifty feet square, a flat platform around which a low railing ran. There were no walls. Metal supports stood up like thick columns at intervals. The globe above their heads was hollow, else not even the tough reinforced steel of the Tower could have supported its weight.</p>
    <p>They could not see the sphere. Nine feet above their heads, the ceiling was plated with thickness after thickness of Ardath's alloy, the only thing that would halt the radiation of atomic energy. Court fumbled with a televisor.</p>
    <p>"Wish I'd had this finished weeks ago," he complained. "Ardath showed me how to build it, but I didn't have time. Let's see--"</p>
    <p>The screen ran riot with color that swiftly faded into a uniform gray.</p>
    <p>"Trying for China?" Marion asked, coming to stand close to Court.</p>
    <p>He nodded.</p>
    <p>"The other Tower. I'm getting it. Here it is!"</p>
    <p>On the screen, the fat, butter-colored face of Li Yang appeared. The beady black eyes stared.</p>
    <p>"Court? Hello. How is the work?"</p>
    <p>"All finished," Court sighed. "We're just waiting for you. Bolted the last connection half an hour ago."</p>
    <p>"Fine!" the Oriental applauded. "We'll be ready tomorrow, perhaps sooner. Wait a moment. Here's Ardath."</p>
    <p>The Kyrian's thin, ascetic face replaced that of Li Yang. His eyes were red-rimmed with fatigue.</p>
    <p>"So you're finished, Court," he said. "Good. My workmen were not much slower. We'll be done in a few hours, not tomorrow, Li Yang. Then we can turn on the power. Don't forget"-- Ardath's lips thinned--"we must be careful. Both of us must turn on the switches at exactly the same moment. Otherwise there will be disaster.</p>
    <p>"The atomic screen must meet just halfway around the Earth. If you turn on your power too soon, your energy screen will smash mine back and destroy this Tower completely. We must be completely accurate."</p>
    <p>Court glanced at an instrument panel near him.</p>
    <p>"I will. Wait a minute. Someone's coming up in the elevator."</p>
    <p>The warning bell was ringing. Presently the lift rose into view. An overalled figure, half hidden under the weight of a wooden box, stepped out of the cage.</p>
    <p>Scipio turned from where he had been leaning on the rail and staring down into the black gulf. He peered at the workman. Marion's brows drew together in puzzlement.</p>
    <p>"What's this?" she asked. "We didn't--"</p>
    <p>The box fell crashing to the floor. The face of the man behind it was revealed. It was no longer bearded; clean-shaven now, and with the hair bleached yellow. Yet the arrogant mouth, hawk nose and the tawny amber eyes could belong to only one man.</p>
    <p>Thordred!</p>
    <p>His hand swept up, a lens blinking bluely in it. The mouth gaped in a snarl.</p>
    <p>"Don't move!" His voice shook with mad fury. "Don't move a muscle. I've come back!"</p>
    <p>Court still stood before the televisor. On the screen he saw Ardath's face watching, immobile and intent. He glimpsed a heavy wrench that was lying forgotten on the ledge of the televisor. It was hidden from Thordred's view by the instrument's bulk. Court let his hand gently close over it.</p>
    <p>"Don't be a fool," he said. "You can't possibly escape."</p>
    <p>Thordred laughed harshly. "No, you saw to that. Your police have come after me. If I hadn't stolen your memories, I'd never have escaped them. I disguised myself as a workman and rode up here. Nobody stopped me. And I have a weapon now! I made it, with the knowledge and memories I took from Ardath."</p>
    <p>Marion's face was paper-white. Scipio stood motionless, his gigantic hands gripping the rail behind him.</p>
    <p>"What do you intend to do?" Court asked.</p>
    <p>"Kill you," Thordred rasped. "Then I'll turn on the power --I know how to do that--and the energy will destroy Ardath in his Tower. With you two out of the way, I can rule the Earth. My brain, with the combined knowledge of yours and his, is wiser than any other in the world."</p>
    <p>"You may do that," Court admitted, warily watching for an opening. "But what about the Plague?"</p>
    <p>"I haven't forgotten that. The Towers can be repaired. The Earth Shield can be created, even without you and Ardath. But then I shall rule this planet!"</p>
    <p>Softly, without moving his" lips, Court whispered into the televisor.</p>
    <p>"Turn on your power, Ardath. It'll destroy Thordred. We'll go with it, but that's the only way."</p>
    <p>The Kyrian did not speak, but he shook his head slightly. Thordred moved forward. The blue lens in his hand rifted.</p>
    <p>"Now," he said. "Now you die!"</p>
    <p>Court's muscles tensed for a hopeless leap. He knew he could not reach the other in time. His fingers tightened over the wrench. Scipio had not moved. His eyes were aglow.</p>
    <p>Murder-lust sprang into Thordred's dark face. He aimed the crystal--</p>
    <p>"Thordred!"</p>
    <p>Ardath's voice rang out from the televisor. Startled, Thordred involuntarily glanced toward the instrument. Simultaneously on the screen a beam of blinding white light flashed from Ardath's hand. It flamed into Thordred's eyes, blinding him.</p>
    <p>Roaring, the giant shook his head, a ray of blue radiance spearing wildly from the lens he held. Court snatched up the wrench and hurled it with all his strength. It struck Thordred's hand. The lens was hurled away, to shatter on the metallic floor.</p>
    <p>Ready to hurl himself at Thordred, Court was halted by Scipio's bull voice. The Carthaginian roared:</p>
    <p>"Back, Court! He is mine--mine to slay!"</p>
    <p>No longer blinded by the ray, Thordred turned to face this new menace. With the snarl of a cornered beast, he closed with his attacker. The mighty, hair-covered hands closed about Scipio's throat. The Carthaginian tore them away, and the two men gripped each other about the waist.</p>
    <p>They reeled back and forth, each striving to throw the other. To and fro on the platform they wrestled, hundreds of feet above the ground. Staggering to the railed brink and back, Thordred bellowed with insane rage. His mouth gaped open as he sought to sink his teeth in Scipio's throat.</p>
    <p>The Carthaginian swung his fist in a short arc. The power of the blow brought blood gushing from Thordred's cheek.</p>
    <p>Court and Marion--and, on the screen, Ardath and Li Yang--watched the two titans battle. The men were well matched. Thordred was the taller, but Scipio seemed to weigh a trifle more. Yet the raging, murderous frenzy that filled them both was exactly equal.</p>
    <p>Abruptly Thordred drove a foul blow at Scipio's middle. The Carthaginian grunted, and his guard dropped for a moment. Instantly Thordred hurled himself upon his opponent. The two went down, Thordred on. top. The hairy hands again sank in Scipio's corded throat.</p>
    <p>Court sprang forward, the wrench in his hand. Scipio turned his head slightly. His deep voice roared a warning.</p>
    <p>"Back, Court! He is mine to slay!"</p>
    <p>Then the iron hands of the gladiator from Carthage found their mark--the throat of the savage from the Earth's youth.</p>
    <p>And they sank deep, deep! All the tremendous strength in Scipio's muscles seemed to flow into his arms. Cords and knots stood out under his bronzed skin.</p>
    <p>Thordred's face was suddenly gorged with purple. Blood stained his shaved chin, began trickling down. Desperately he strove to throttle his opponent. Abandoning the effort, he released his grip and stabbed his fingers down at Scipio's eyes.</p>
    <p>The Carthaginian expertly rolled his head, and the foul missed its mark.</p>
    <p>Thordred was suddenly clawing at the terrible hands that shut off his breath. His body jerked and writhed like a hooked fish. His eyes were distended and protruding. Frantically he tried to tear himself free, and could not. . . .</p>
    <p>"You left her to die," Scipio whispered.</p>
    <p>Court knew that he spoke of Jansaiya, the Atlantean priestess.</p>
    <p>One last frightful effort Thordred made. Something snapped with a brittle, crackling report. Simultaneously the giant flung himself up with one uncoiling motion. He stood upright, amber eyes glaring, breath hissing and rattling into his starved lungs.</p>
    <p>Suddenly the huge head lolled forward slackly on its broken neck. For a heart-beat, Thordred stood silhouetted against the dark sky. Then he crashed lifeless to the floor.</p>
    <p>Scipio sprang up. He heaved up the heavy body of Thordred and went staggering toward the railing. He flung the body out into the abyss, and stared after it with brooding eyes.</p>
    <p>"Your vengeance, Jansaiya," he whispered. "And mine!"</p>
    <p>Then Scipio Agricola Africanus, the man from Carthage, put his head down on his arms. He began to weep great choking sobs that ripped harshly from his throat.</p>
    <p>Court looked away in sympathy and walked toward the televisor screen. Against it Marion leaned, faint with reaction. Both Ardath and Li Yang were watching. Though the Oriental's gross yellow face was immobile, his lacquer eyes were suddenly aglow with pity.</p>
    <p>"Ohe," Li Yang sighed softly. "Alas for such men as Scipio, who find neither thrones nor love."</p>
    <p>Ardath turned when a man appeared behind him on the screen. After a few words, he faced Court.</p>
    <p>"The work has been done sooner than I expected. We can turn on the power now. Compare your chronometer with mine."</p>
    <p>The two delicate time-pieces checked precisely.</p>
    <p>"At exactly eleven, throw your switch," Ardath instructed. "I shall do the same."-</p>
    <p>There were ten seconds to go--five--three--</p>
    <p>Court's hand trembled on the switch.</p>
    <p>Two. One. . . .</p>
    <p>Now!</p>
    <p>Deafening thunder bellowed out from the summit of the Tower. For miles around, the roaring blast shattered windows and awakened sleepers to panicky fright. White light made the country bright as day. For a second, the maelstrom of raving light and sound continued. Then it swiftly died. There was silence, save for a low humming.</p>
    <p>"Good!" Ardath said on the screen. "We timed it exactly right. In two minutes, watch the sky. If it lights up, we have succeeded."</p>
    <p>With one accord, Court and Marion hurried to the railing. Even Scipio rifted his head to stare at the black sky.</p>
    <p>Two minutes to wait. The incredible barrier of electrons, the curtain of atomic energy, was rushing around the Earth, spreading out from the points of origin in the twin Towers.</p>
    <p>One minute dragged by. Then, without warning, the sky turned white. The dim stars vanished. A curtain of pallid white brilliance hung over the Earth, like a shining ivory bowl overturned upon the land.</p>
    <p>A single heart-beat it remained, and then faded and was gone. But Court knew that the Earth Shield had been created. That barrier would forever safeguard mankind. . "We've won!" His voice was hoarse with triumph. "Marion, we've saved humanity!"</p>
    <p>There was something inexpressibly tender in the girl's eyes as she watched him. For now she knew that Stephen Court was a man whom she could love and cherish--not a cold, inhuman machine. In the hour of his triumph, he exulted not because he had solved a terrible problem with his keen brain. Court rejoiced because he had saved human beings from horror and death.</p>
    <p>"Yes," Marion said softly. "We've won, Steve. Both of us have won what we wanted."</p>
    <p>From the metallic sphere overhead, invisible energy flared out, challenging the stars as it poured its mighty power into the Earth Shield. . . .</p>

     <p>EPILOGUE</p>

    <empty-line/>
    <p>One year later, a little group stood on the Wisconsin hills, examining a huge golden space ship that loomed against the green slope and the summer sky. It had taken months to build a new vessel to Ardath's specifications. But at last the task had been finished, the equipment installed, and the provisions taken aboard. In every respect, the craft was a duplicate of the Kyrian original, save for a few new devices which Ardath and Court had perfected. Scipio, Li Yang and Ardath stood together at the open airlock, Marion and Court a few feet away. It was difficult to find words at this moment of sad farewell.</p>
    <p>"I am sorry you will not go with us, both of you," Ardath said after a time. "Yet you may be right."</p>
    <p>"You know how I feel about it," Court returned. "The Plague is destroyed. It will never come again, thanks to the Earth Shield. But new dangers may arise. These people among whom I was born are my people. I must be ready to serve and help them. I think that was the reason I was given a mind evolved beyond my time.</p>
    <p>"I can help in so many ways, Ardath. There is so much I can do to improve this world of mine. Already, in one year, vast strides have been made. Atomic power has outlawed war. When I die, I want to die in a Utopia that I have helped to build."</p>
    <p>Ardath nodded with understanding. "I came through time to find a super-mind whom I could abduct to start a new race. Well, I have found that super-mind--and you are wiser than I, Stephen Court. We are all part of some cosmic pattern, and this pattern works toward good and not evil. It builds and does not destroy. So I shall go on in my search for a race where I can find kinship and happiness. Perhaps, a thousand years from now, I shall stand beside your grave, Court."</p>
    <p>"I, too," Scipio broke in. "Your world is a fine one, Court, and some of it I like. But I follow a dream. Mayhap I can carve out a kingdom in some distant future--" He did not finish, but his face was suddenly somber. "I cannot stay here," he said at last. "Jansaiya died here, and that would always be an aching pain in my heart."</p>
    <p>"Nor will I remain," Li Yang murmured. "Perhaps it is merely curiosity that impels me to go on with Ardath. I do not know. But the unknown has a certain fascination, and I am anxious to know what will exist a million years from now. So farewell, and"--the tiny mouth twisted grotesquely--"and do not forget fat old Li Yang."</p>
    <p>The gross figure turned hastily and disappeared into the ship.</p>
    <p>Scipio bent and touched his lips to Marion's brow before he squeezed Court's hand in a mighty grip.</p>
    <p>"The gods watch over you," he rumbled, and was gone inside.</p>
    <p>Now Ardath's strange, alien eyes dwelt on the faces of Marion and Court.</p>
    <p>"There is nothing I can say," he whispered. "Only, farewell."</p>
    <p>Some indefinable bond of kinship between minds flashed for an instant as Court and Ardath gazed into each other's eyes. Then the Kyrian stepped back into the ship and the port swung shut.</p>
    <p>The vessel lifted. It rose silently and dwindled against the blue, a bright golden ovoid that faded to a speck and was out of sight. It sped toward the orbit it would follow around the Earth, perhaps for thousands of years, until Ardath and Scipio and Li Yang awoke to follow their strange destiny.</p>
    <p>Two figures stood close together on the slope. Marion and Court looked up until all trace of the golden ship was gone. There was only the blue sky then, and the green hills of 'Wisconsin.</p>
    <p>Still silent, and with the man's arm holding the girls sum form close to him, they turned to retrace their steps to the highway where a car waited. There was nothing they could say, and no need for words had they found any. . . .</p>

     <p>CHAPTER I.</p>
     <p>FACE OF A GIRL</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>FAR OFF IN the jungle an animal screamed. A river-moth flapped against the screen, nearly as large as a fruit-bat: And very far away, subsensory, almost, Brian Raft could hear the low pulsing of drums. Not unusual, drums on the Jutahy, in the great valley of Amazonas. But these were no signal messages.</p>
    <p>Raft wasn't an imaginative man. He left all that to Dan Craddock, with his Welsh ghosts and his shadow-people of the lost centuries. Still, Raft was a doctor, and when those drums throbbed in the jungle something curious happened here in his little hospital of plastic shacks, smelling of antiseptic. Something he couldn't ignore.</p>
    <p>When a sick man's blood beats in rhythm with the distant drums, slow or fast as the far-off echoes set the pace, a doctor has reason to wonder....</p>
    <p>The great moth beat softly against the screen. Craddock bent over a sterilizer, steam clouding up around his white head so that he looked like a necromancer stooping over a cauldron. The drums throbbed on. Raft could feel his own heart answering to their rhythm.</p>
    <p>He glanced at Craddock again and tried not to remember what the older man had been telling him about his wild Welsh ancestors and the things they had believed. Sometimes he thought Craddock believed them too, or half believed, at least when he had been drinking.</p>
    <p>He'd got to know Craddock pretty well in the months they had worked together, but he realized that even yet he knew only the surface Craddock, that another man entirely lived in abeyance behind the companionable front which the Welshman showed him, a man with memories he never spoke of, and stories he never told.</p>
    <p>This experimental station, far up the Jutahy, was a curious contrast, with its asepsis and its plastics and its glitter of new instruments, to the jungle hemming it in. They were on assignment just now to find a specific for atypical malaria.</p>
    <p>In the forty years since the end of World War II, nothing yet had been discovered any safer than the old quinine and atabrine treatment, and Raft was sifting the jungle lore now to make sure there might not be some truth in the old Indio knowledge, hidden behind masks of devil-worship and magic.</p>
    <p>He had hunted down virus diseases in Tibet, Indo-China, Madagascar, and he had learned to respect much that the witchdoctors knew. Some of their treatments were based on very sound theories.</p>
    <p>But he wished the drums would stop. He turned irritably from the window and glanced once more at Craddock, who was humming a Welsh ballad under his breath. A ballad full of wild, skirling music about ghosts and fighting.</p>
    <p>Craddock had talked a lot lately--since the drums began--about ghosts and fighting. He said he smelled danger. In the old days in Wales men could always scent trouble in the wind, and they'd drink quarts of uisquebaugh and go out brandishing swords, ready for anything. All Raft could smell was the reek of disinfectant that filled the little hospital.</p>
    <p>And all the wind brought to him was the sound of drams.</p>
    <p>"In the old days," Craddock said suddenly, looking up from the sterilizer and blinking through steam, "there'd be a whisper in the air from Tralee or Cobh, and we knew the Irish were coming over the water to raid. Or maybe there'd be something from the south, and we'd get ready for the men of Cornwall. But we'd know. We'd know."</p>
    <p>"Rot!" Raft said.</p>
    <p>"Okay. But I felt something like this once before." Craddock sucked in his breath, a curious look of fright and incredulity on his wrinkled brown face. He turned back to the steam-cloud, and Raft watched him in puzzled wonder.</p>
    <p>There was a mystery about Craddock. He was a biologist, and a good one, but for thirty years or more he had hung around the Jutahy country, never venturing farther away than Manaos, living precariously as a sort of jungle general practitioner.</p>
    <p>Raft had added him to the party on impulse, since Craddock knew the country and the natives. He hadn't expected too much of the Welshman in the laboratory, for something had happened to Craddock's hands--they were badly maimed. But he was pleasantly disappointed on that score.</p>
    <p>Raft watched the mutilated hands working with hypodermics, twisting plunger from tube, deftly pulling the hollow needles free. Craddock had three fingers on one hand, and the other was a claw, with oddly stained and textured skin. He never spoke of what had happened. His injuries didn't look like the scars of acid burns or animal teeth. Still, he was surprisingly deft, even when liquor was heavy on his breath.</p>
    <p>It was heavy now, and Raft thought the man must be deliberately timing his motions to the rhythms of the drums. Or perhaps not. Raft himself had to pause consciously and break step with the beat. And some of the sick men in the ward were alive, he thought, solely because the drum-beats would not let their hearts stop pumping.</p>
    <p>"A week now," Craddock said, with that rather annoying habit he had of catching another man's thought, or seeming to. "Have you noticed the charts?"</p>
    <p>Raft ran a nervous forefinger along the lean line of his jaw. "That's my job," he grunted.</p>
    <p>Craddock sighed.</p>
    <p>"You haven't lived in Brazil as long as I have, Brian. It's the things you don't usually notice that count. Up to a week ago, this plague was killing off the Indians fast. The vitality level's gone up a lot in the last seven days."</p>
    <p>"Which is crazy," Raft told him. "It's accidental--just a cycle. There's no reason. The drums have nothing to do with it."</p>
    <p>"Did I mention drums?"</p>
    <p>Raft glared.</p>
    <p>Craddock put the hypos in the sterilizer and closed the lid.</p>
    <p>"The drums aren't talking, though. It's not Western Union. It's just rhythm. And it means something."</p>
    <p>"What?"</p>
    <p>The Welshman hesitated. His face was in shadow, and his white hair gleamed like a fluffy halo in the overhead light. "I think, maybe, there's a visitor in the forest. I wonder now. Have you ever heard of Curupuri?"</p>
    <p>Raft's face was a mask.</p>
    <p>"Curupuri? What's that?"</p>
    <p>"A name. The natives have been talking about Curupuri. Or maybe you haven't been listening."</p>
    <p>"I seem to miss a lot around here," Raft said with heavy irony. "I haven't seen a ghost for months."</p>
    <p>"Maybe you will." Craddock turned to stare toward the window. "Thirty years. It's a long time. I--I've heard of Curupuri before, though. I even--"</p>
    <p>He stopped, and Raft breathed deeply. He'd heard too, but he didn't want to admit it. Superstition is apt to be psychologically dangerous in the jungle, and Raft knew that Curupuri was a widespread belief among the Indios. He'd encountered it ten years ago, when he was younger and more impressionable. And yet, he thought, it's the only possible god for the Amazon Basin.</p>
    <p>For Curupuri was the Unknown. He was the blind, ravening, terrible life-force that the Indios think is the spirit of the jungle. A savage, primeval Pan, lairing in the darkness. But nothing so concrete as Pan.</p>
    <p>Curupuri moved along the Amazon as vast and inchoate and yet as tangible as life itself. Here in the jungle one realizes, after a while, that a god of life can be far more terrible than a god of death. The Amazonas is too alive. Too enormous for the mind to comprehend, a great green living thing sprawled across a continent, blind, senseless, ravenously alive.</p>
    <p>Yes, Raft could understand why the Indios had personified Curupuri. He could almost see him as they did, a monstrous shapeless creature, neither beast nor man, stirring enormously in the breathing fertility of the jungle.</p>
    <p>"The devil with it," Raft said, and drew deeply on his cigarette. It was one of his last cigarettes. He moved to Crad-dock's side and stared out the window, drawing smoke gratefully into his lungs and savoring the second-hand taste of civilization.</p>
    <p>That was all they'd had for a year--second-hand civilization. It wasn't too bad. Madagascar had been worse. But there was quite a contrast between the sleek modern architecture of the home base, the Mallard Pathological Institute overlooking the Hudson, and this plastic-walled collection of shacks, staffed by a few Institute men and some native helpers.</p>
    <p>Three white men, Raft, Craddock, and Bill Merriday, were here. Merriday was plodding but a good research pathologist, and the three of them had worked well together.</p>
    <p>Now the work was ready to be wound up, and presently Raft knew he'd be in New York again, rushing by air-taxi from roof night-club to club, cramming the excitement of civilization into as short a time as possible. Then a little later, he realized, he'd be feeling a familiar itch again, and would be heading for Tasmania or Ceylon or--somewhere. There were always new jobs to be tackled.</p>
    <p>The drums were still throbbing faintly, far off in the dark. After a while Raft left Craddock in the lighted lab and wandered outside, down to the river, trying not to listen to the distant pulse of sound....</p>
    <p>A full moon rode up from the Atlantic, brightening the great pleasure-city of Rio, swinging up the Amazon to the backlands, a huge yellow disc against a starry backdrop. But across the Jutahy was the jungle, black towering walls of it, creeping and swarming with a vitality that was incredible even to a scientist. It was the fecund womb of the world.</p>
    <p>Hot countries mean growth, but in the Amazonas is growth gone wild. Its rich alluvial soil, washed down for ages along the rivers, is literally alive; the ground beneath your feet moves and stirs with vitality. There is something unhealthy about such abnormal rioting life, unhealthy as the flaming Brazilian orchids that batten on rottenness and blaze in the green gloom like goblin corpse-lights....</p>
    <p>Raft thought of Craddock. Odd! That inexplicable mixture of incredulity and fear that Raft thought he sensed in the Welshman was puzzling. There was something else, too. He frowned, trying to analyze a vague shadow, and at length nodded, satisfied. Craddock was repelled by the drums but he was also drawn, attracted by them in some strange way. Well, Craddock had lived in this part of the forest for a long time. He was nearly Indio in many ways.</p>
    <p>Something moving out on the surface of the river, sheet-silver under the moon, roused Raft from uncomfortable thoughts. In a moment he could see the outlines of a small boat, and two heads silhouetted against the silvery water. The men were pulling in toward shore and the hospital's lighted window.</p>
    <p>"Luiz!" Raft called sharply. "Manoel! We've got visitors."</p>
    <p>A feeble hail came across the water, and he saw the two outlines slump down, as if the last efforts of exhaustion had brought them to the landing. Then came excitement--the boys running with lights and shouts, everybody who could walk swarming to the doors and windows to watch. Raft helped beach the boat and superintended as the two almost unconscious men were carried up to the hospital.</p>
    <p>One of them, he saw, wore an aviator's helmet and clothing; he was beyond speech. The other, a slender, bearded man, rather startlingly graceful even in this extremity, lurched toward the door.</p>
    <p>"Senhor, senhor," he murmured, in a soft voice.</p>
    <p>Craddock came out to help. He stopped dead still on the threshold, though crowding bodies hid the two arrivals from sight. Raft saw a look of absolute panic come over the Welshman's face. Then Craddock turned and retreated, and there was the nervous clinking of a bottle.</p>
    <p>Bill Merriday's stolid, intent features were comfortingly normal by contrast. But as Merriday, bending over the aviator, was stripping off the man's shirt, he suddenly paused.</p>
    <p>"I'll be hanged," he said. "I know this chap, Brian. Thomas, wait a minute. I'll have it. Da something... da Fonseca, that's it! I told you about that mapping expedition that flew in a couple of months ago, when you were in the jungle. Da Fonseca was piloting."</p>
    <p>"Crack-up," Raft said. "What about the other man?"</p>
    <p>Merriday glanced over his shoulder.</p>
    <p>"I never saw him before."</p>
    <p>The thermometer read eighty-six, far below normal.</p>
    <p>"Shock and exhaustion," Raft surmised. "We'll run a stat C.B.C., just in case. Look at his eyes." He pulled back a lid. The pupils were pin-points.</p>
    <p>"I'll take a look at the other man," Merriday said, turning. Raft scowled down at da Fonseca, a little uncomfortable, though he could not have said exactly why. Something seemed to have entered the room with the two men, and it was nothing that could be felt tangibly. But it could be sensed.</p>
    <p>Frowning, Raft watched Luiz milk a specimen from the patient's finger. The overhead light fell yellow and unsteady on da Fonseca, upon a glitter of sudden brilliance from something that hung on a chain about his neck. Raft had thought it a religious medal, but now he saw that it was a tiny mirror, no larger than a half-dollar. He picked it up.</p>
    <p>The glass was convex, lenticular, and made of a dark, bluish material less like glass than plastic. Raft glimpsed the cloudy, shapeless motion of shadows beneath its surface.</p>
    <p>A little shock went through him. The mirror did not reflect his face, though he was staring directly into it. Instead he saw turbulent motion, though there was no such motion in the room. He thought of storm-clouds boiling and driving before a gale. He had the curious, inexplicable feeling of something familiar, an impression, an inchoate mental pattern.</p>
    <p>Thomas da Fonseca. He caught the extraordinary impression, for a flashing, brilliant moment, that he was looking into da Fonseca's eyes. The--the personality of the man was there, suddenly. It was as though the two men were briefly en rapport.</p>
    <p>Yet all Raft saw was the driving, cloudy motion in the mirror.</p>
    <p>Then the storm-swirl rifted and was driven apart. From the tiny lens in his hand a vibration ran up the nerves of his arm, striking into his brain. He stared down.</p>
    <p>Now that the clouds had cleared away, it was not a mirror, but a portrait. A portrait? Then a living portrait, for the face within it moved....</p>
    <p>A mirror, after all, then. But no--for that was certainly not his own face that looked back at him out of the small oval.</p>
    <p>It was a girl's face, seen against a background of incredible richness and strangeness that vanished as he looked, because she leaned forward as if into the very mirror itself, her herd blotting out the remarkable background. And it was no painted picture. She moved, she saw--Raft. He drew his breath in sharply.</p>
    <p>There was never such a face before. He had no time to see her very clearly, for the whole unbelievable glimpse was gone in an instant. But he would have known her out of a thousand faces if they ever met again.</p>
    <p>The look of delicate gayety and wickedness in the small, prim curve of her mouth, the enormous translucent eyes, colored like aquamarines, that looked, for a moment, into his very solemnly above the sweet, malicious, smiling mouth.</p>
    <p>There could be no other face like it in the world.</p>
    <p>Then the mists rolled between them as they stared. Raft remembered later that he shook the lens passionately in a childish attempt to call her back, shook it as if his own hands could part those clouds again and let him see that brilliantly alive little face, so gay and solemn, so wicked and so sweet.</p>
    <p>But she was gone. It had all happened almost between one breath and the next, and he was left standing there staring down at the lens and remembering the tantalizing--oddness--of that face.</p>
    <p>An oddness seen too briefly to understand except as something curiously wrong about the girl who had looked into his eyes for one fraction of a second. Her hair had been--odd.</p>
    <p>The eyes themselves were almost round, but subtly slanted at the corners, and with a blackness ringing them that was not wholly the black of thick lashes, for a prolonged dark streak had run up from their outer comers a little way, accentuating their slant, and giving a faint Egyptian exoticism to the round, soft, dainty face with its rounded chin. So soft--he remembered that impression clearly. Incredibly soft, she had looked, and fastidious.</p>
    <p>And wrong. Racially wrong.</p>
    <p>The mirror was blank again, and filled with the trembling fogs. But, very briefly, it had opened upon another world.</p>

    <p>LUIZ WAS staring at Raft in surprise.</p>
    <p>"S'nhor?" Luiz said.</p>
    <p>"What?" Raft answered.</p>
    <p>"Did you speak?"</p>
    <p>"No." Raft let the lens fall back on da Fonseca's bare chest.</p>
    <p>Merriday was at his side. "The other man won't let me look at him," he said worriedly. "He's stubborn."</p>
    <p>"I'll talk to him," Raft said. He went out, trying not to think about that lens, that lovely, impossible face. Subjective, of course, not objective. Hallucination--or self-hypnosis, with the light reflecting in the mirror as a focal point. But he didn't believe that really.</p>
    <p>The bearded man was in Raft's office, examining a row of bottles on a shelf--fetal specimens. He turned and bowed, a faint mockery in his eyes. Raft was impressed; this was no ordinary backwoods wanderer. There was a courtliness about him, and a smooth-knit, muscular grace that gave the impression of fine breeding in both manners and lineage. He had also an air of hardly concealed excitement and a certain hauteur in his poise which Raft did not like.</p>
    <p>"Saludades, s'nhor," he said, his too-bright eyes dazzling in the light. Fever, perhaps, behind that brilliant stare. His voice was deep, and he spoke with an odd, plaintive undertone that held a distant familiarity. "I am in your debt."</p>
    <p>His Portuguese was faulty, but one didn't notice that. Raft had a feeling of gaucherie, entirely new to him.</p>
    <p>"You can pay it right now," he said brusquely. "We don't want the station contaminated, and you may have caught something up-river. Take off your shirt and let's have a look at you."</p>
    <p>"I am not ill, doutor."</p>
    <p>"You recover fast, then. You were ready to pass out when you came into the hospital."</p>
    <p>The black eyes flashed wickedly. Then the man shrugged</p>
    <p>and slipped out of the ragged shirt. Raft was a little startled at the smooth power in his sleek body, the muscles rippling under a skin like brown satin, but rippling very smoothly, so that until he moved you hardly realized they were there.</p>
    <p>"I am Paulo da Costa Pereira," said the man. He seemed faintly amused. "I am a garimpeiro."</p>
    <p>"A diamond-hunter, eh?" Raft slipped a thermometer between Pereira's lips. "Didn't know they had diamonds around here. I should think you'd be in the Rio Francisco country."</p>
    <p>There was no response. Raft used his stethoscope, shook his head and tried again. He checked his findings by Pereira's pulse, but that didn't help much. The man's heart wasn't beating, nor did he apparently have a pulse.</p>
    <p>"What the devil!" Raft said, staring. He took out the thermometer and licked dry lips. Da Fonseca's temperature had been below normal but Pereira's was so far above normal that the mercury pushed the glass above 108°, the highest the glass tube could register.</p>
    <p>Pereira was wiping his mouth delicately. "I am hungry, s'nhor" he said. "Could you give me some food?"</p>
    <p>"I'll give you a glucose injection," Raft said, hesitating a little. "Or--I'm not sure. Your metabolism's haywire. At the rate you're burning up body-fuel, you'll be ill."</p>
    <p>"I have always been this way. I am healthy enough."</p>
    <p>"Not if your heart isn't beating," Raft said grimly. "I suppose you know that you're--you're impossible? I mean, by rights you shouldn't be alive."</p>
    <p>Pereira smiled.</p>
    <p>"Perhaps you don't hear my heartbeat. I assure you that it's beating."</p>
    <p>"If it's that faint, it can't be pumping any blood down your aorta," Raft said. "Something's plenty wrong with you. Lie down on that couch. We'll need ice-packs to bring your temperature down."</p>
    <p>Pereira shrugged and obeyed. "I am hungry."</p>
    <p>"We'll take care of that. I'll need some of your blood, too."</p>
    <p>"No."</p>
    <p>Raft swore, his temper and nerves flaring, "You're sick. Or don't you know it?"</p>
    <p>"Very well," Pereira murmured. "But be quick. I dislike being--handled."</p>
    <p>With an effort, Raft restrained an angry retort. He drew the necessary blood into a test-tube and capped it.</p>
    <p>"Dan!" he called. There was no answer.</p>
    <p>Where the devil was Craddock?</p>
    <p>He summoned Luiz and handed him the test-tube. "Give this to Doutor Craddock. I want a stat C.B.C." He turned back to Pereira. "What's the matter with you? Lie back."</p>
    <p>But the diamond-hunter was sitting up, his face alive and alight with a wild, excited elation. The jet eyes were enormous. For a second Raft watched that stare. Then the glow went out of Pereira's eyes and he lay back, smiling to himself.</p>
    <p>Raft busied himself with ice-bags. "What happened up-river?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know," Pereira said, still smiling. "Da Fonseca blundered into my camp one night. I suppose his plane crashed. He couldn't talk much."</p>
    <p>"Were you alone?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, I was alone."</p>
    <p>That was odd, but Raft let it pass. He had other things on his mind--the insane impossibility of a living man whose heart did not beat. Ice-cubes clinked.</p>
    <p>"You a Brazilian? You don't talk the lingo too well."</p>
    <p>The feverishly brilliant eyes narrowed.</p>
    <p>"I have been in the jungle a long time," the man said. "Speaking other tongues. When you do not use a language, you lose it." He nodded toward the bottles on the wall. "Yours, doctor?"</p>
    <p>"Yes. Fetal specimens. Embryonic studies. Interested?"</p>
    <p>"I know too little to be interested. The jungle is my--my province. Though the sources of life--"</p>
    <p>He paused.</p>
    <p>Raft waited, but he did not go on. The strange eyes closed.</p>
    <p>Raft found that his fingers were shaking as he screwed the tops on the ice-bags.</p>
    <p>"That thing da Fonseca wears around his neck," he said, quite softly. "What is it?"</p>
    <p>"I had not noticed," Pereira murmured. "I have had a difficult day. If I might rest, it would be nice."</p>
    <p>Raft grimaced. He stared down at that cryptic, inhuman figure, remembering the odd malformation of the clavicle he had felt during his examination, remembering other things. Some impulse made him say, "One last question. What's your race? Your ancestors weren't Portuguese?"</p>
    <p>Pereira opened his eyes and showed his teeth in an impatient smile that was near to a snarl.</p>
    <p>"Ancestors!" he said irritably. "Forget my ancestors for tonight, doutor. I have come a long way through the jungle, if you must know it. A long, long way, past many interesting sights. Wild beasts, and ruins, and wild men, and the drums were beating all the way." His voice lowered. "I passed your ancestors chattering and scratching themselves in the trees," he said in a purring murmur. "And I passed my ancestors, too." The voice trailed off in an indescribably complacent sound. After a moment of deep silence, he said, "I would like to sleep. May I be alone?"</p>
    <p>Raft set his teeth. Delirium, of course. That accounted for the senseless rambling. But that imperious dismissal was intrinsic in the man himself. Now he gathered his rags about him as if they had been ermine. He seemed to fall asleep almost instantly. From his recumbent form there breathed out a tremendous vitality that set Raft's nerves jangling.</p>
    <p>He turned away. A heartbeat so faint that it was imperceptible? Ridiculous. Some new disease, more likely, though its symptoms were contradictory. Pereira seemed in perfect health, and yet he obviously couldn't be.</p>
    <p>There might be another answer. A mutation? One of those curious, specialized human beings that appear occasionally in the race? Raft moved his mouth impatiently. He went back to check on the aviator, conscious of a queer, rustling alertness permeating the hospital, as though the coming of the two men had roused the place from sleep to wakefulness.</p>
    <p>There was no change in da Fonseca, and Merriday was busy with stimulants. Raft grunted approval and went in search of Craddock.</p>
    <p>Halfway down the hall he stopped at the sound of a familiar voice. The diamond-hunter's low, smooth tones, urgent now, and commanding.</p>
    <p>"I return this to you. I have come very far to do it, s'nhor."</p>
    <p>And Dan Craddock replying in a stumbling whisper that held amazement and fear.</p>
    <p>"But you weren't there! There was nothing there, except--"</p>
    <p>"We came later," Pereira said. "By the sun and the waters we guessed. Then at last we had the answer."</p>
    <p>Raft let out his breath. A board creaked under him. Simultaneously he heard a--a sound, a susurrus of faint wind, and felt a sense of inexplicable motion.</p>
    <p>Startled, he hurried forward. The passage lay blankly empty before him. Nothing could have left the laboratory without his knowledge. But when he stood on the threshold he faced Craddock, and Craddock alone, staring in blank, astounded paralysis at nothing.</p>
    <p>Quickly Raft searched the room with his eyes. It was empty. The window screens were still in place, and, moreover, were so rusted that they could not be removed without considerable noise.</p>
    <p>"Where's Pereira?" he asked curtly.</p>
    <p>Craddock turned to face him, jaw slack. "Who?"</p>
    <p>"The man you were just talking to."</p>
    <p>"I--I--there was nobody here."</p>
    <p>"Yeah," Raft said. "So I'm crazy. That wouldn't surprise me, after what's happened already tonight." He noticed a booklet in Craddock's hand, a ring-bound notebook with its leather cover moulded and discolored by age. The Welshman hastily stuffed it into his pocket. Avoiding Raft's probing eyes, he nodded toward the microscope.</p>
    <p>"There's the blood. I must have bungled it somehow. It's all wrong." Yet he didn't seem unduly surprised.</p>
    <p>Raft put his eye to the lens. His lips tightened.</p>
    <p>"So I am crazy," he said.</p>
    <p>"It is funny, isn't it?" Craddock said, inadequately.</p>
    <p>It was more than funny. It was appalling. The vascular system has certain types of blood cells floating free, of course; they have a definite form and purpose, and intruding organisms may affect them in various ways.</p>
    <p>But this specimen on the slide showed something Raft had never seen before. The red cells were oval instead of disc-shaped, and in place of the whites there were ciliated organisms that moved with a writhing, erratic motion.</p>
    <p>And moving fast--too fast!</p>
    <p>"They've slowed down a lot since I first looked," Craddock said. "In the beginning they were spinning so quickly I couldn't even see them."</p>
    <p>"But what sort of bug would do that? It's destroyed the phagocytes. Pereira ought to be dead, if he hasn't a white blood cell in his body. No, there's a mistake somewhere. We'd better run some reagent tests."</p>
    <p>They did, going through the routine, but found nothing. Te every test they could devise, the reaction was that of apparently normal blood. Furthermore, the writhing ciliate things seemed not to be malignant. When toxic matter was introduced the ciliates formed a barrier of their own hairy bodies, just as phagocytes should have done, but three times as effective.</p>
    <p>A specimen slide glittered and trembled in Craddock's mutilated hand.</p>
    <p>"It's an improvement," he said. "Those bugs are better than whites."</p>
    <p>"But where are the whites?"</p>
    <p>"Deus, how should I know?" Craddock's fingers slid into the pocket where he had placed that discolored notebook. "I'm not in charge here--you are. This is your problem."</p>
    <p>"I wonder if it is," Raft said slowly. "Just what was there about the--sun and the waters?"</p>
    <p>Craddock hesitated. Then a wry, crooked smile twisted his mouth.</p>
    <p>"They appeared quite normal to me," he said. And, turning on his heel, was gone.</p>
    <p>Raft stared after him. What was behind this? Craddock obviously knew Pereira. Though how that interview had been held, Raft did not know. Ventriloquism? He snorted at the thought. No, Pereira had been in the laboratory with Craddock, and then he had, seemingly, walked through solid walls.</p>
    <p>Which meant--what?</p>
    <p>Raft turned to the microscope again. There was no help there. In the sane, modern world of 1985 there was simply no place for such irrationalities. Incidentally, where was Pereira now?</p>
    <p>He wasn't in the office where Raft had left him. And as Raft hesitated on the doorway, he heard a sound that brought blood pumping into his temples. He felt as though the subtle, half-sensed hints of wrongness had suddenly exploded into action.</p>
    <p>It was merely the faint pop-popping of exhaust, but there was no reason for the motor launch to be going out at this hour.</p>
    <p>Raft headed for the river. He paused to seize a flashlight. There were faint shouts. Others had caught the souhd of the engine too. Merriday's bulky form loomed on the bank.</p>
    <p>Raft leveled the light and sent the beam flashing out into that pit of shadows. The smooth surface of the river glinted like a stream of diamonds. He swung the beam. There was the motor launch, ploughing a black furrow in the shining water as it melted away into the gloom where the flashlight's rays could not penetrate.</p>
    <p>But just as it vanished the light caught one full gleam upon a face--Pereira's face, laughing back across his shoulder, white teeth glittering in the velvety beard. Triumph was arrogant in his laughter, the elation Raft had sensed before.</p>
    <p>There was someone with him; Raft found it impossible to make out who that someone was. The Indies were running along the cleared bank, and a couple of them had put out in a canoa, but that wouldn't help. Raft drew the pistol he always carried in the jungle. The thought of sending a bullet after that arrogant, laughing face was very pleasant.</p>
    <p>"No, Brian!" Merriday said, and pulled down his arm.</p>
    <p>"But he's getting away with our boat!"</p>
    <p>"Dan Craddock's with him," Merriday said. "Didn't you see?"</p>
    <p>The pop-popping of the motor was fainter now, dying into the dim murmur of the Jutahy drums. Raft stood motionless, feeling bewildered and helpless.</p>
    <p>"Nothing we can do till morning, anyway," he said presently. "Let's go back inside."</p>
    <p>Then a voice he did not know jabbered something in Portuguese.</p>
    <p>"He has gone back to his own land--and he has taken something with him."</p>
    <p>Raft flashed the light up into the face of the aviator, da Fonseca, his flyer's cap gripped in one hand as he fumbled at his throat, groping, searching. The pupils of his eyes were no longer tiny. They were huge.</p>
    <p>"Taken what?" Merriday said.</p>
    <p>"My soul," da Fonseca said quite simply.</p>
    <p>There was a moment of stillness. And in that pause da Fonseca's words fell with nightmare clarity.</p>
    <p>"I had it in a little mirror around my neck. He put it there. It gave him the power to--to--" The thin, breathless voice faded.</p>
    <p>"To do what?" Raft asked.</p>
    <p>"To make men slaves," the aviator whispered. "As he did with the doutor."</p>
    <p>Craddock! Raft had a sudden insane relief that the Welshman had not, then, gone off willingly with Pereira, in some mysterious unfathomed partnership. Then he was furious with himself for instantly accepting such a fantastic explanation from a man so obviously mad.</p>
    <p>Yet it was an explanation. There seemed to be no other.</p>
    <p>"Let me down," da Fonseca said, stirring against the hands that held him upright. "Without my soul I cannot stay here long."</p>
    <p>"Carry him inside," Raft said. "Bill, get a hypo. Adrenalin."</p>
    <p>Da Fonseca had collapsed completely by the time he was laid gently on a cot. His heart had stopped. Merriday came running with a syringe.</p>
    <p>He had put on a long needle, guessing Raft's intention.</p>
    <p>Raft made the injection directly into the heart muscle. Then he waited, stethoscope ready. He was conscious of something--different. Something changed.</p>
    <p>Abruptly he knew what it was. The drums. They were louder, shouting, triumphant. Their beat was like the throbbing of a monster heart--of the jungle's heart, dark and immense.</p>
    <p>Da Fonseca responded. Raft heard the soft pounding through the instrument, and those heart-beats were timed exactly to the rhythm of the Jutahy drums. His lids lifted slowly. His voice was hollow, chanting.</p>
    <p>"He goes back now--and the gate of Doirada opens to his coming--He goes back--to the sleeping Flame. By the unseen road, where the devils of Paititi watch at the gate of Doirada...."</p>
    <p>Louder roared the drums. Louder beat da Fonseca's heart. His voice grew stronger.</p>
    <p>"The sun was wrong. And the river was slow--too slow. There was a devil there, under the ice. It was--was--"</p>
    <p>He tore again at his throat, gasping for breath. His eyes held madness.</p>
    <p>"Curupuri!" he screamed, and the drums crashed an echo.</p>
    <p>And were still.</p>
    <p>There was silence, blank and empty. As though at a signal, the Jutahy drums had stopped.</p>
    <p>Da Fonseca fell back like a dead man on the cot. Raft, sweat cold on his skin, leaned forward, searching with his stethoscope at the bared chest.</p>
    <p>He heard nothing.</p>
    <p>Then, far out in the jungle, a drum muttered once and was still.</p>
    <p>Da Fonseca's dead heart stirred with it.</p>
    <p>And fell silent.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER III.</p>
     <p>GATE TO PAITITI</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>WITH FIVE INDIOS Dr. Brian Raft went up the Jutahy after Craddock and Pereira. He went with his lips thinned grimly, and a deep doubt in his mind. Merriday he left at the base hospital, to wind up the experiment and send the records back to the Institute.</p>
    <p>"You can't go alone," Merriday had said. "You're crazy, Brian."</p>
    <p>Raft nodded.</p>
    <p>"Maybe. But we worked with Dan for nearly a year, and he's a white man. As for Pereira, sometimes I'm not entirely sure that he was a--man."</p>
    <p>Stolid Merriday blinked.</p>
    <p>"Oh, but that's nonsense."</p>
    <p>"I told you what happened. He had no heartbeat. His temperature was crazy. And the way he walked through the laboratory wall wasn't strictly normal, was it?"</p>
    <p>"Da Fonseca said some queer things before he died, too. You're not starting to believe them, are you?"</p>
    <p>"No," Raft said. "Not yet. Not without a devil of a lot of proof. Just the same, I wish I'd got a chance at that notebook of Craddock's. Pereira said he was returning it. And that stuff about the sun and the river being too slow. Two people mentioned that, you know; da Fonseca and Pereira. Moreover, Dan seemed to understand what it meant."</p>
    <p>"More than I do," Merriday grunted. "It's dangerous for you to go up-river alone."</p>
    <p>"I've got a hunch Craddock went up-river, a long time ago. What he found there is a mystery." Raft shook his head. "I don't know. I just don't know, Bill. Anyway, they didn't have much fuel aboard, and I think I can catch up with them."</p>
    <p>"I wish you'd let me go with you."</p>
    <p>But Raft wouldn't agree to that. In the end, he went out alone, the Indies paddling the big canoa untiringly up against the current. He had supplies--what he could get hastily together--and guns and ammunition. The natives helped him find Pereira's track. For, all too soon, the diamond-hunter left the river.</p>
    <p>"Two men walking," Luiz said, eyeing the underbrush.</p>
    <p>Walking. That meant either that Craddock was going willingly now, or else there was force being employed. Hypnosis, perhaps, Raft thought, remembering the lens-mirror. More and more often now he recalled the exotic, paradoxical face of the girl. How she tied into the mystery he could not guess, but remembrance of her made him more willing to seek out the solution.</p>
    <p>So they went westward toward the Ecuadorian border, where a thousand little rivers rise to pour into the great Solimoes that feeds the Amazon itself. Ten days and ten nights they traveled. ...</p>
    <p>On the eleventh morning the Indies were gone, even the faithful Luiz. No sound, no alarm--but Raft was alone when he woke. Perhaps they had deserted. Perhaps th'e jaguars had got them. The beasts had been holding a devil's sabbath in the forest during the night. Raft didn't find any traces.</p>
    <p>His lips drew down more grimly, and he went on, slower because tracking was hard work, for another ten days. He pushed on doggedly through the green breathing walls of the silent jungle, which pulsated with invisible life--never sure that the next turn of the way might not bring him face to face with the deadly giboya, or one of the omnipresent jaguars, or Pereira himself.</p>
    <p>He could not have done it at all except for the years of rigorous outdoor life and tropical experience. But he kept on his quarry's track.</p>
    <p>Then, in the end, he found what the dying da Fonseca had called the unseen road. *"</p>
    <p>The day before, from the height of a crest--he was getting into mountains--he had seen the great valley, an immense horizon-reaching bowl of fertile forest stretching further than his eye could follow. It was an ocean of moving green. But the track led down into it.</p>
    <p>There was a roughly circular space down there where the shade of green was different. It must be very large, for it was far away--miles in diameter. Partly it seemed to be cupped between mountains, and Raft caught the flash of a river far off circling around the nearer curve of it. Perhaps fifty miles in diameter, the place was, but distances are deceptive in the forest. He followed the trail, and it led him directly toward that oasis of green within the green.</p>
    <p>Raft had stood the trip well. His face was more deeply seamed, his eyes were red-rimmed, yet he felt little weakness. A sound medical knowledge helped him there. Fevers were rife in this country. Fevers, but no Indios. Animals only, and chiefly the jaguars.</p>
    <p>Animals! The place swarmed with life, Raft thought wearily. Everything around him was movement, the bright flutter of insects and brilliant birds, the watery gliding of a snake rippling to cover, the smooth, furtive motion of the big cats, the erratic hysteria of tapir or peccary. All about him was the jungle itself, like a vast composite animal, terribly alive.</p>
    <p>Then, in a clearing, he saw plainly the tracks he had been following. Craddock's, and the diamond-hunter's. Pereira had been leading. A rare blaze of sunlight glanced down from overhead, picking out the colors of leaf and flower.</p>
    <p>At one spot in the green wall Raft saw something curious--an oval tunnel curving away into the matted jungle as if some gigantic serpent had passed this way, pressing the vines and trees aside, flattening the floor, leaving its own shape carved out of the living vegetation. The footprints led across the clearing toward that green tunnel of gloom.</p>
    <p>The footprints stopped halfway across the open space.</p>
    <p>Instinctively Raft looked up. But there were no trees close enough. With a long sigh he let the pack slide from his shoulder, but he didn't let go of the rifle.</p>
    <p>There was a path, he saw now, beginning where the footprints stopped, six feet wide, depressed a little below the surface of the ground.</p>
    <p>Odd!</p>
    <p>He went forward--and jerked back, startled. Something had touched him. An invisible, cool tangibility that stood unseen here in the quiet air of the glade.</p>
    <p>Raft put his hand out cautiously. It was halted in midair. A smooth, glassy, invisible surface. He explored the surface by touch, since sight could not help him. The thing seemed to be a hollow tube, nine or ten feet high--he threw pebbles to test that--and it was made of some perfectly transparent substance, on which not even dust could settle.</p>
    <p>As Raft glanced along its unseeable winding length into the jungle he could observe how it pressed the trees aside to make way for it, supporting hanging orchids in midair, stopping the flight of a humming-bird that dashed itself in bewilderment against the solid air.</p>
    <p>As he stood there, wondering, the first deep roar of the jaguar echoed through the clearing. Raft whirled, lifting his rifle. He could see the leaves vibrate to that deep-throated sound, but of the jaguar itself he could see nothing.</p>
    <p>Yet it must be very near--it must be very large--and it must be on the verge of a charge, Raft decided, listening to the coughing breathing of the great cat.</p>
    <p>He was in the open here. Coming to a quick decision, he bent, seized his rucksack, and tossed it behind him into the invisible tunnel. Rifle at the ready, he backed after it, and under his feet the yielding earth gave place to something hard and smooth. The great, echoing yell came once more, reverberating strangely from the tunnel walls.</p>
    <p>Then something soughed past him. A whispering--dim, distant, fainter than a breath. Before him, like heat-waves in the air, a shimmer swept across the tunnel-mouth.</p>
    <p>Instantly all sound ceased. Raft's ears rang with the dead, intense silence. He reached out into empty air, and it was not empty.</p>
    <p>Across the mouth of the tube stretched the same glass-smooth barrier that were walls and roof and floor to him. The doorway was closed. The gate--the Gate to Paititi?</p>
    <p>A trap? Had Pereira set this snare?</p>
    <p>Raft patted the stock of his rifle. All right, a trap, then. But he wasn't exactly unarmed. He'd go ahead, since that had been his intention anyway. Only he would not go it blind. He would be ready.</p>
    <p>There was no sign of the jaguar. He put the pack on his shoulders and started walking. The footing was smooth, but not slippery. Something seemed to hold his feet down. This wasn't glass. It was, perhaps, a force-field, an invisible screen of pure energy. Da Fonseca had spoken of the unseen road.</p>
    <p>Check.</p>
    <p>He hiked on, across the clearing, into the forest, not letting himself wonder too much yet. There was plenty to mink about. Raft had long ago learned the trick of shutting his mind to thoughts which he was not yet ready to entertain.</p>
    <p>He had closed his mind time after time in these twenty days to one recurring vision--the gay, solemn, radiant face of the girl in the mirror, seen impossibly in one glance, and never to be forgotten.</p>
    <p>It was not exactly a path. Had Raft not known that he walked in a tunnel, and had it not been for the utter, dead stillness, there would have seemed no reason for alarm. The jungle still rose solid and shadowy about him.</p>
    <p>Butterflies fluttered brilliantly past. Birds trailed their fantastic plumage through the leaves. Now and then a cloud of tiny stinging puims blew past outside the stuff that was not glass.</p>
    <p>Magellan, very long ago, had written of Brazilian trees that gave soap and glass, distorted versions of the hevea that flows rich latex. There was often truth in legends. The Seven Cities of Cibola--they were real, even though they had never been paved with gold.</p>
    <p>Vespucci, Raft recalled from some dark cranny of memory, had mentioned a Lake Doirada, somewhere in the sertao, with shining cities on its banks. And the kingdom of Paititi, that da Fonseca had spoken of. In the old days bands of mamelucos had gone out on more than one expedition to find Paititi.</p>
    <p>He could recall only fragmentary scraps. Paititi, where some of the natives were dwarfs and some were giants, some had their feet turned backwards, and others had legs like birds. The usual legendary yarns.</p>
    <p>Nobody had ever found Paititi.</p>
    <p>Raft got the torch out of his pack. The path had been sinking deeper and deeper below ground level. Now, a few yards ahead, the black depths of a tunnel loomed. The tube .was plunging underground. It was impossible to keep one's footing on that breakneck slant, and Raft advanced very cautiously, wondering how Pereira and Craddock had managed it.</p>
    <p>The light stabbed out. There was nothing to see but the compressed earth walling him in. The tunnel angled down steeply. Too steeply. Raft realized abruptly that he had gone too far. Something had tricked him, a shifting of balance, a--a warping of gravity, it seemed. For, he realized unmistakably, an unknown force was keeping him upright as a fly keeps its footing on perpendicular walls.</p>
    <p>For an instant giddiness made his head swim. This ramp was not perpendicular, of course, but he had no suction cups on his feet. Nevertheless he maintained his balance on a slope of at least forty-five degrees.</p>
    <p>Pure energy, he thought. Walls of force!</p>
    <p>He went on down, though now he had no way of telling whether he was climbing or descending. Only logic showed that, since it was dark, he was probably going deep into the earth.</p>
    <p>Then, after a long time, came a sudden change. Light glowed curiously from around a curve ahead. Dim light, more like a darkness alive with twisting, coiling refractions. Raft went on warily.</p>
    <p>It was water.</p>
    <p>It went over and around the tunnel in a smooth, swift, glassy current, foam-marbled, perfectly silent, gleaming in the beam of the torch.</p>
    <p>Raft thought, The Children of Israel went upon dry land in the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall unto them.</p>
    <p>Still another miracle occurred on a journey beginning to be laden with miracles. Raft's jaw set a bit harder. He went ahead, vaguely hoping that what had happened to the Egyptians wouldn't happen to him. If that wall should break, it would be unfortunate.</p>
    <p>The wall did not break. He went forward into a long period of blackness, broken only by the light beam. He was, he realized, very far down now. For all he knew he might be descending a completely perpendicular path, the warped gravity of the tunnel making such a fantastic descent possible.</p>
    <p>A faint glow warned him to switch off the light. Darkness closed in, but it did not last for long. His eyes adjusted them-sevles to a dim violet glow that seemed to come from all sides, above, below, everywhere. Vertigo made Raft's head spin sickeningly.</p>
    <p>Far, far below him, but at an impossible, angle, seen slantingly through the transparent floor, was the jagged curve of an immense cavern.</p>
    <p>In a moment more logic asserted itself and the vertigo grew even worse, for Raft saw now that it was he himself who stood at that incredible angle, not the apparently tilted cave. It was bathed in faint violet light. The walls were crags, the roof, high above, dripped with stalactites that glittered wanly in the dimness.</p>
    <p>The cave was narrow and curved right and left out of sight. The tunnel swept down in a dizzying arc and vanished into a spot of darkness in a distant wall. Raft knew that he should be totally unable to keep his footing on that tremendous slide. But as he advanced gingerly on the invisible flooring, it seemed the cavern and not himself was defying gravity.</p>
    <p>Far down in the violet darkness something moved. Something alive. Raft could not see it clearly. Beyond it was another motion, and up among the crags of the walls, still more motion. The high, narrow, violently tilted cavern was coming alive all around him with those moving shadows which converged upon him as he stood frozen there in midair.</p>
    <p>Devils of Paititi!</p>
    <p>Biologically they were impossible. He could see only their outlines, but there were shadows that looked like wings--and great talons--and--and other things. No two of them were alike. The logic of anatomy had gone wrong, somehow, and Raft's mouth felt dry and sour.</p>
    <p>They had seen him, obviously. They were moving sluggishly toward him, with a slowness more disturbing than any speed--as if they knew they could afford to take their time.</p>
    <p>A shudder shook Raft. Though he knew that Pereira and Craddock had come this way, suddenly his footing did not seem so secure on that airy bridge. He had the sensation of toppling on the brink of a pit thronging with monsters from pure nightmare. If there were a break in this tunnel of glass, disaster would overwhelm him.</p>
    <p>Biological sports, he told himself, and went on.</p>
    <p>Ten minutes further along the dark tunnel he came to a fork of the way, the first one he had encountered. There was no clue as to which way he should turn. At random Raft took the right-hand branch, and this time luck was with him.</p>
    <p>The ending of the tunnel was an anti-climax. He saw the circle of light long before he reached it. It was a deep, clear radiance which seemed to block the passage. Another force-wall, Raft thought, like the substance of the tube itself. But it was different in that it reflected light, or glowed with a cool brilliance of its own.</p>
    <p>He touched the smooth glossy surface of it. Nothing. Simply light made tangible. Light that was, he saw, growing paler as he watched.</p>
    <p>Shadows and shapes appeared in the cloudy whiteness, ghostly and strange. A wavering outline darkened and altered. It was man-shaped, and Raft's gun slipped easily into his hand. Beyond the- figure were other dun traceries, tall columns, and what seemed to be a stream.</p>
    <p>The light faded and was gone. With a whispering murmur the barrier dissolved.</p>
    <p>The stream became a staircase, dropping steeply away from Raft's feet to the floor of an immense hall empty save for the columns, huger than the Kamak pillars, that marched hi diminishing rows into the distance. Empty, save for these, and for the girl who stood facing him, ten feet down the stairway, very lovely, and--with something subtly wrong about her round, soft face.</p>
    <p>She moved her hands quickly. Behind Raft a whisper sang softly. He looked back, in time to see the barrier of the light spring into being across the tunnel's mouth.</p>
    <p>The road back was closed.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
     <p>JANISSA</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>SHE WAS as he remembered her from that brief glimpse hi da Fonseca's lens. There was a prim, gay touch of wickedness about her small mouth. The shadowed eyes were aquamarine, given a subtle slant by the darkness about them. Her hah- was--was tiger-striped.</p>
    <p>Honey-yellow and dim gold, it was a cloud about her head, so fine that it seemed to fade off into invisibility.</p>
    <p>Her garments, blue and gold, clung so closely to her slim body that they seemed like a second skin. At her waist was a wide belt, and now she thrust something into a pocket of it as she smiled at Raft.</p>
    <p>With that smile her face changed. It was infinitely appealing, completley tender and welcoming. Her voice, when Raft heard it, was as he expected. A rippling murmur, with that same familiar haunting undertone he had caught in Pereira's voice.</p>
    <p>The language was unknown to him, though. Seeing this, the girl switched to stumbling Portuguese, and then, shrugging her slim shoulders, tried an Indio dialect that Raft knew, though he had never heard it spoken in quite this way.</p>
    <p>"Don't be frightened," she said. "If I guided you this far, do you think I'll let anything harm you now? Though once I was afraid, when you hesitated at the fork of the road. But you took the right turning."</p>
    <p>Raft had bolstered his gun, but his hand still lingered on its cool, reassuring metal. In the same dialect he answered her.</p>
    <p>"You guided me here?"</p>
    <p>"Of course. Parror does not know; he was too busy getting enough to eat outside." She chuckled. "He hated that. He's a</p>
    <p>good hunter, but burning meat over open flames--ugh! Parror is not as complacent as you may have thought."</p>
    <p>"Parror?" Raft said. "Would that be Pereira?"</p>
    <p>"Yes. Now come with me, Brian Raft. You see that I know your name. But there's much that I do not know, and you must tell me those things."</p>
    <p>"No," Raft said. He hadn't moved from his position at the top of the staircase. "If you know so much, you know why I came here. Where's Dan Craddock?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, he's awake now." She took a tiny lens from her belt and swung it idly. "Parror gave me back my mirror when he returned, since it was no longer needed to keep Craddock controlled. So I was able to see you coming through the jungle. You had looked into my mirror, and after that I could see you. Which was lucky for you, or you'd never have been able to open the gateway to Paititi."</p>
    <p>"Take me to Craddock," Raft commanded, feeling very unsure of himself, and therefore acting very sure. "Now."</p>
    <p>"All right." The girl's hand touched Raft's arm, urging him down the steps. As they descended the enormous columns seemed to rise above them, the vastness of the huge hall becoming more and more apparent.</p>
    <p>"You haven't asked me my name," the low voice said.</p>
    <p>"What is it?"</p>
    <p>"Janissa," she told him. "And this is Paititi. But you must have known that."</p>
    <p>Raft shook his head.</p>
    <p>"You may know a lot about the outside world, but it's a one-way circuit. The only place I'd ever heard of Paititi was in a legend."</p>
    <p>"We have our legends too."</p>
    <p>They were at the foot of the stairs. Janissa guided him across the hall and through an arched opening into a mosaic-walled passage.</p>
    <p>There were symbols on those walls, but they struck a note entirely strange to Raft. Once or twice he noticed pictures, but the figures in them seemed to have no resemblance to either Janissa or Pereira--Parror. He. had no time to observe closely.</p>
    <p>The girl led him into a smaller hall, up a stairway, and at last into a round room whose walls were softly padded with velvet, cushioned and quilted in patterns like flowers. The floor was padded, too. The whole room was like a great pillowed sofa.</p>
    <p>He had a moment to take it all in--the cushiony room, its strangeness and luxury, and the rich, deep colors of the velvet. He saw at one end of the room an oval door of some semi-translucent substance opening upon dim light, and in another wall was an archway, broad and low, which looked out upon moving trees.</p>
    <p>There was something rather startling about the trees, but he had no time to look closely. He caught the fragrance of a breeze, though, smelling of flowers and damp jungle lustiness where the sun seldom shines, and realized that he had come out at last upon the surface of the earth somewhere, after the long journey underground.</p>
    <p>"Sit down and rest," Janissa said. "You've come far."</p>
    <p>Raft shook his head.</p>
    <p>"You said you were taking me to Craddock. Well?"</p>
    <p>"I cannot do that yet. Parror is with him."</p>
    <p>"Good." Raft touched his gun. Janissa merely smiled.</p>
    <p>"In Parror's castle--in this land where he has power--you think that will help you?"</p>
    <p>"I think so. If it won't, there are other ways." He unslung the rifle from his shoulder and leaned it against a cushioned wall. "I don't know what kind of superman Parror may be, but I'll bet he can't dodge a bullet."</p>
    <p>"A bullet? Oh, I see. You are both right and wrong. Your weapon would have been useless against Parror outside, but in Paititi he is more vulnerable."</p>
    <p>Raft stared at the strange, lovely, disturbingly different face upturned to him.</p>
    <p>"Meaning what?"</p>
    <p>"Parror does not know that you are here. So--"</p>
    <p>"But Parror does know," said a very soft, smooth voice. Raft whirled, surprise heightening his pulse and making his breath catch. Parror!</p>
    <p>He had come soundlessly through the oval door, and Raft realized, with some distantly logical comer of his mind, that Parror must have been much farther ahead than he had thought, for the man had had time to bathe and change from his ragged garments. The black beard was trimmed to no more than a velvety shadow outlining the heavy, but curiously delicate chin.</p>
    <p>The garments he wore were thick, soft, gleaming like dull satin, and fitting so perfectly they might have been literally painted upon his body. He was fingering an odd weapon like a silver whip that hung from the broad jeweled belt he wore.</p>
    <p>Raft felt suddenly very unsure of himself. This was too different a meeting from the one he had been anticipating. For this was not the jungle. There was, very definitely, something about Parror that made Raft's skin crawl. Wrong--wrong--a racial wrongness he could not define. He had felt it about Janissa, but not with the violence he felt now.</p>
    <p>Arrogance clothed Parror like a garment. He was in his own environment. He was regally confident. Raft had an uncomfortable realization of his own awkwardness and crudity and, from the mockery in the velvety black eyes, he knew that Parror shared the thought.</p>
    <p>Parror lifted his lip in a fastidious smile.</p>
    <p>"You were not needed here," he said, in the Indio dialect. "But perhaps, after all, I can find a use for you. Yes, I think I can."</p>
    <p>"We may, Parror," Janissa murmured, and for an instant unsheathed swords seemed to flash between the two.</p>
    <p>"Listen, Pereira or whatever you call yourself, we're going to have a talk," Raft said angrily. "Now. It'll be fast talking, too."</p>
    <p>"It will?" Parror murmured, and moved the silver whip jingling in his hand.</p>
    <p>"Where's Craddock? What did you do to him?"</p>
    <p>"I did nothing. I showed him a certain mirror. Through it he saw--well, I do not know what he saw. But he was tranced."</p>
    <p>"Wake him up. Take me to him."</p>
    <p>"He is awake now."</p>
    <p>"He'd better be," Raft said coldly, his eye on Parror's whip and his fingers touching a cool gun-butt. "You killed da Fonseca with this same funny business, didn't you?"</p>
    <p>"Killed him? The mirror is mine. I lent it to him and took it back."</p>
    <p>"Yours?" Janissa breathed.</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Parror ignored her. "What happened after that is no concern of mine. I had no further use for da Fonseca. And his tongue might have been a danger."</p>
    <p>Sudden rage flooded Raft. The bearded man's arrogance, his indifference, even the subtle wrongness he could not put a name to made all the tension of the past three weeks crystallize into a hot fury. A bullet was not enough. Raft wanted to use his hands.</p>
    <p>"You bicho!" he snarled. "If Craddock dies I'll break your filthy neck. Take me to him!"</p>
    <p>He lunged forward and seized Parror's shoulder, feeling a savage delight in coming to grips with the man at last.</p>
    <p>He knew judo. He was well-muscled and agile. But he did not expect Parror to--explode.</p>
    <p>It was as if the handsome bearded face vanished and a demon glared out through the flesh and bone of the features. In that instant of utter, inhuman rage Raft saw the lips flatten away from Parror's teeth in a tigerish snarl, and he hissed shockingly as he struggled to tear free. Raft felt the smooth surge of muscles, and the power in them was shocking too, out of all proportion to that sleek, long-limbed slenderness. There was a moment of straining conflict.</p>
    <p>Behind him, above the roaring in his ears, Raft heard Jan-issa's voice.</p>
    <p>"Brian! Let him go--quick!"</p>
    <p>The desperate urgency of her tone made Raft respond.</p>
    <p>Shaken, a little dazed by his own anger and by the sudden, explosive violence it had roused, he released Parror. He felt oddly dazzled. He had never seen any human being, sane or mad, in the grip of a fury as sudden or as demoniac as Parror's.</p>
    <p>There was another thing, too. The closeness of the grip had revealed a new, totally unexpected feature. Under the muscular arch of Parror's chest Raft had felt a steady throbbing that was unmistakable.</p>
    <p>And yet--back in the base hospital--the man had had no heartbeat!</p>
    <p>Parror drew back, shook himself, relaxed into an imperturbable dignity. Miraculously, the insane fury was gone as suddenly as it had been roused.</p>
    <p>"You must not touch those of our race in such a way, Brian," Janissa said softly. "If you must kill, then kill. But not maul."</p>
    <p>Raft's own voice sounded strange to him.</p>
    <p>"What is your race?" he asked, and his questioning gaze moved from the girl's demure face to the man's enigmatic dark eyes.</p>
    <p>Parror said nothing. He only smiled, a long, slow, infinitely proud smile. And Raft read the answer. He had been seeing it more and more clearly every moment that passed, in every smooth, flowing motion of his body, even in his insane, inhuman fury at being touched. Inhuman indeed. Raft remembered what Parror had said in the hospital.</p>
    <p>"I passed your ancestors, chattering and scratching themselves in the trees. And I passed my ancestors, too."</p>
    <p>Yes, Raft knew now that he had passed them in the jungle unseeing, many times. They had gone silently by in the underbrush, on great padding feet, the shadows of the forest gliding across the shadowy markings of their bodies. He had heard their roaring in the dark, and seen their lambent eyes in the firelight.</p>
    <p>He thought he knew, now, what race Parror's was. And Janissa's.</p>
    <p>Not human. They came from a different stock. As a physician who had done biological and anthropological work, Raft knew that the incredible thing was not theoretically impossible. Evolution is not rigid. It was an accident that had made man the dominant, intelligent race. Accident, and the specialization of opposing thumbs.</p>
    <p>Our ancestors were simian, arboreal, using those flexible hands to build the foundations of civilization. But in a different setup, the ruling race might have descended from dogs or reptiles or cats.</p>
    <p>Cats.</p>
    <p>It struck Raft suddenly, and he was shocked by the realization, that of all animals there is, except for the rodents who do not use it, only one which shows signs of developing an opposing thumb. The domestic cat does occasionally have an extra toe on each forefoot. An opposing toe.</p>
    <p>The owner names it Mittens or Boxer and thinks no more about the matter. But given a little flexibility in that extra member, and given time and a favorable environment, such as this secret world of Paititi he did not yet know, what miracles might now develop!</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Feline stock. That, perhaps, explained a great deal, but it did not clear up the entire mystery by any means. Raft still had no idea of the connection between Parror and Dan Crad-dock, nor exactly what was the lens-mirror that had killed da Fonseca. There were many other problems as well. Too many.</p>
    <p>He noticed a tenseness ripple through Janissa, as though she had bristled. The word sprang unbidden into his mind. Almost simultaneously, he caught a distant noise, the tramp of feet, the ringing of metal upon metal.</p>
    <p>Parror did not seem surprised. He turned toward the translucent door, and shadows loomed against the pale panel. There was a knock.</p>
    <p>"Parror?" Janissa said. Her voice held a question.</p>
    <p>He spoke to her briefly in the tongue Raft did not understand. She looked quickly toward Raft. Her eyes grew blank. A veil of demure withdrawal dropped down upon her. Suddenly, with a smooth, lithe motion, she was on her feet and vanishing among the trees beyond the arched portal.</p>
    <p>Parror called a command. The oval swept up and vanished. Across that threshold, silhouettes against faint light, came men. Men?</p>
    <p>They wore close-fitting chain-mail, very finely meshed. Glittering caps of tiny metal links, interwoven into designs, protected their heads. There were ten of them, and each had at his belt a thin, bare blade like a rapier.</p>
    <p>They had the same mingled strength and delicacy of features that marked Parror, the same lithe, flowing agility. The taint of the tiger was in the way they moved, and the way their slanted eyes glowed intently on Raft.</p>
    <p>Parror had stepped back, with a little shrug, and the ten men, without pausing, closed in on Raft. He realized his danger, though none of them had drawn a sword. He sprang toward the wall where his rifle leaned, saw that he would be intercepted, and snatched out his revolver.</p>
    <p>Thin, wiry metal burned like a hot brand about his wrist. Parror had lashed out with his whip. The gun spun from Raft's grip. He felt the onrush of charging bodies, but, curiously, none of the soldiers touched him.</p>
    <p>The shining rapiers were out, flickering, gleaming, weaving a deadly mesh all around him. Up and down, feinting, dancing, the steel sang, and Raft drew back, respecting the menace of those glittering swords. He swung toward Parror, but the bearded man had retreated and stood by the open archway, watching alertly.</p>
    <p>"He speaks the Indio?" a deep voice asked.</p>
    <p>Parror nodded. A soldier with a bronzed, scarred face gestured toward Raft.</p>
    <p>"Will you come with us peacefully?"</p>
    <p>"Where?" Raft countered.</p>
    <p>"To the Great Lord."</p>
    <p>"So you're not the big shot around here," Raft said to Parror. "Okay, I'll play it that way. Maybe it won't turn out exactly as you expect."</p>
    <p>Parror smiled. "I said I thought I could find a use for you," he murmured in Portuguese. Then he relapsed into the cryptic tongue of the cat-people, and the scarred soldier asked a quick question. Parror's answer seemed to be satisfactory, for the man lowered his rapier.</p>
    <p>"Well, Craddock, will you come?" The guard looked at Raft and spoke in Indio.</p>
    <p>Craddock? Raft started to answer but Parror cut him off. There was another quick, enigmatic exchange.</p>
    <p>Raft interrupted.</p>
    <p>"My name's not Craddock. I'm Brian Raft, and I came here after Craddock. That man--" He pointed at Parror "--kidnapped him."</p>
    <p>"I'm sorry," Parror said. "Such a trick won't work, and I cannot help you now. The Great Lord rules here. You must talk to him. Best to go with Vann."</p>
    <p>Vann, the scarred soldier, grunted.</p>
    <p>"He's right. Lies will not save you. Come! As for you, Parror..."</p>
    <p>He spat out a few words Raft could not understand. Parror's eyes narrowed, but he made no reply.</p>
    <p>A point pricked Raft's back. With a longing glance toward his fallen gun, now, with rifle and rucksack, in the hands of the soldiers, he moved unwillingly forward. Over his shoulder he looked hard at Parror.</p>
    <p>"I'll be back," he said, a world of promise in his tone.</p>
    <p>Then he stepped through the oval portal and was in Paititi.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER V.</p>
     <p>VALLEY OF WONDERS</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>AGAIN, AND EVER after that, he was conscious of the indefinable strangeness about the lost land that set it apart from any other of which he had heard. Raft had read tales of hidden civilizations, of Atlantis, Lemuria, and fantastic survivals from the past.</p>
    <p>But in Paititi he found nothing of such arabesques--no jewel-city set down on an uncharted sea, no isolated world cut off from the earth outside. Nevertheless Paititi was as secret, as isolated, as if it had been on another planet.</p>
    <p>It was too alive to be regarded as anything but a vivid, vital reality. Mixed with mat tremendous vitality which pulsed through Paititi was the strangeness that hung like an intangible veil between earth and sky, the thing that had made mis secret valley a place blessed and cursed as no spot on earth ever had before been.</p>
    <p>Something had leaned down and touched the soil of Paititi, the trees of Paititi, the very air that breathed through alien leaves, and there had come a change. It was as though the touch of that unearthly thing had altered all that dwelt here, changing and transmuting until what remained was different.</p>
    <p>It was a valley, probably a meteoric one, Raft thought, remembering that fifty-mile-wide circle of jungle he had seen from above. But it was well camouflaged. No earthly trees could have fulfilled that task, and no earthly trees grew here. Looking out across that dim twilit land, he was reminded of the columnar pillars that had marched across the hall where Itoe invisible tube ended. Pillars of Karnak--but dwarfed by comparison with these trees that might have upheld the sky itself.</p>
    <p>Yggdrasil is the tree of life which Norsemen say supports the world.</p>
    <p>Only the largest California redwoods could have approached their sheer magnitude. For each one, in diameter, was as thick as a city block is long. They grew at irregular intervals, a half-mile or more apart, and they towered up to a luminous green ceiling which was incredibly far above. A tree five miles high!</p>
    <p>Up they plunged into that green sky, and down into the depths those vast columns fell, like arrows of titan gods deeply embedded in the earth.</p>
    <p>Then- roots, Raft thought, might tap the very roof of Hell. Without branches, smooth and straight, they grew until, at then- tops, they burst into a rank lushness of green.</p>
    <p>Yet that green vault was translucent. At one point, almost directly overhead, an emerald brilliance told of the noonday tropic sun. But in the valley itself hung a clear, cool dawnlight that hid nothing.</p>
    <p>Transparent as the air was, the trees themselves made a barrier. Raft could see a curving arch winding down from where he stood, fifty yards or more to a path that disappeared into that mighty forest. From far away came a very low, scarcely audible rumble, almost below the threshold of hearing.</p>
    <p>That was all. Except that Vann tilted back his head and stared up questioningly. Raft followed his example.</p>
    <p>Behind him were smooth walls and towers, the bulk of Parror's palace that jutted out from the base of a rock cliff, an escarpment which swept up and up till it vanished amid the ceiling of green. And dropping toward them with nightmare slowness was a cloud of rubble and stone.</p>
    <p>"It's only a landslide," Vann said casually. He pushed Raft forward. "There's no danger."</p>
    <p>"No danger!"</p>
    <p>"Of course not." The soldier was surprised. "Surely you know why."</p>
    <p>Again Raft looked up. The avalanche was perceptibly nearer, but by no means as close as it should normally have been. A great boulder struck a ledge, bounded out, and Raft fixed his gaze upon it.</p>
    <p>It fell slowly--slowly!</p>
    <p>It drifted down, revolving gently as it fell, floating out in an arc that ended briefly at one of the castle's turrets. It rebounded, doing no harm to the structure that Raft could see. It dropped past him, so sluggishly that he could make out every detail of its craggy surface, and embedded itself in the ground below.</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>That boulder had not been featherlight. Yet it had floated down as slowly as any feather.</p>
    <p>"Move, Craddock," Vann said, and pushed Raft away from a watermelon-sized rock that struck the ramp and bounded away gently. The other soldiers, looking up, shifted casually to avoid the falling stones. Raft, utterly dumbfounded, stared up.</p>
    <p>"I thought it would wreck the castle," he said.</p>
    <p>"No. The ones who built here built for an eternity," Vann told him. "Not our race, but they were very great once."</p>
    <p>"What the devil made those rocks fall so slowly?"</p>
    <p>The soldier shrugged.</p>
    <p>"They fell faster now than in the days of our fathers. But they are still not dangerous. Only living things can harm one of us. Now we've talked enough. Come."</p>
    <p>He took Raft's arm firmly and led him down the aerial pathway. The soldiers followed, their arms clinking softly, mesh-armor murmuring metallically against steel blades.</p>
    <p>Yes, Raft thought, they had talked enough. Or else not nearly enough. Mystery after mystery was piling up here, and no sooner did he seem to solve one puzzle than another appeared.</p>
    <p>The fact that this race sprang from feline stock explained much but it certainly did not begin to explain boulders that dropped from the sky as lightly as air-inflated, toy balloons.</p>
    <p>Nor did it solve the mystery that surrounded Parror's actions, or Janissa's. At first the girl had seemed friendly. Then she had given up to Parror without an argument. Moreover, the soldiers thought he was Dan Craddock.</p>
    <p>Parror had taken advantage of that twist very neatly, and Raft knew there'was no use trying to prove his identity to Vann. But when he was taken to the Great Lord, presumably the ruler of Paititi, there would be a chance then. Unless, of course, the Great Lord was a hairy savage who wore human skulls at his belt.</p>
    <p>Raft grinned wryly. Savagery there was in this land, he knew already, but it was not barbarous. There was a high culture here, an intelligent civilization, though it was alien. A feline world would be strikingly different from a human one, yet the same basics would apply. An isosceles triangle was the same on Earth or Mars.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, he probably would not be dealing in geometry. The subtler pitfalls of psychology loomed before him, and in that feline and anthropoid might be very dissimilar. A cat people, in fact, would not be builders.</p>
    <p>They would be artisans. Vann had already said that some other race had built Parror's castle. A race that had been very great once. When? A thousand years ago? Or a million? It had taken man eons to evolve into rational beings, and evolution moved at a predetermined rate. Not even mutations could create an intelligent cat-race from feline stock in a few generations.</p>
    <p>There was no use even in wondering about such things now. He stepped from the smooth footing of the ramp on to an ordinary dirt pathway that led off among the colossal trees. Now, with his feet actually touching the ground of Paititi, he felt the strangeness of his surroundings more strongly than ever. Those incredible columns seemed to be moving toward him, a giant Birnam Wood malignantly alive. Trees!</p>
    <p>For they were trees, not Jurassic cycads, not tree-ferns. He could tell that. They were true trees, but they should have grown on a planet as large as Jupiter, not on Earth.</p>
    <p>They were sanctuaries as well, retreats for living organisms, he saw as the trail passed near the towering wall of one. From a distance he had thought the bark smooth. Instead, it was literally covered with irregular bumps and swellings.</p>
    <p>Vines slid across the trunk like snakes, creeping with a slowness that belied the sudden flash of tendrils as--tongues?--snapped out to capture the insects and birds that fluttered past.</p>
    <p>Rainbow flowers glowed on the leafless vines, and a heavy, sweet scent drifted into Raft's nostrils. From something like a shallow shell that jutted from the trunk a lizard darted out, seized a vine, and carried it back, writhing, to its water-brimming den. There it proceeded to drown the snaky thing and devour it at leisure.</p>
    <p>But the reptile was no lizard. It was, Raft decided, a saurian. Only three feet long, it nevertheless reminded him of the great caymans that teem in Brazilian rivers. Except, of course, that crocs are meat eaters.</p>
    <p>The saurian was no freak, for there were others just like it.</p>
    <p>Swelling pale excrescences bulged on the tree, like wasps' nests thirty feet tall, with myriad window-openings from which bright eyes glittered at Raft. Furry brown bodies moved rapidly across these nests, little mammals with tapir-snouts, but adapted to tree-life.</p>
    <p>There were other parasites on that enormous tree, like the great crimson leech that clung to the bark and sucked sap out to nourish its hideous length, and the inch-long, hairless, white creatures like monkeys that lived like lice upon the sloth things that clambered with extraordinary agility in pursuit of insect prey.</p>
    <p>It would have been symbiosis, except that the parasites had nothing to give the trees upon which they lived as on a world. Trees and living vines and the rubbery pale moss that bordered the path, there was no other vegetation here.</p>
    <p>But of the fantastic there was much. Before Raft's amazement had died they crossed a brook, a half mile further on, by a narrow bridge that might have been made of glowing plastics. No fish were visible through that glassy translucence, and as Raft looked down, he felt that nothing remotely normal could ever exist in those enchanted waters. For the stream, too, was wrong.</p>
    <p>It was silent. It did not purl and ripple softly over the rocky bed. Small cascades and waterfalls dropped, with hypnotic, quiet slowness, into the pools beneath. Ripples spread out very gently, very slowly, to die against the mossy banks.</p>
    <p>It was not water. Water it could not be. It seemed half congealed.</p>
    <p>Yet when Raft, with a questioning glance at Vann, knelt beside the brook and lifted cupped hands to his mouth, it was water. Droplets escaped from between his fingers and floated down gently to fall upon the thirsty moss.</p>
    <p>Slowly as the boulders that had dropped upon Parror's castle the waters glided on--silently. It was Oberon's glade, where sorcery lay heavy. The sweeet fragrance of the living vine-flowers hung on the clear air.</p>
    <p>What spell holds this land, Raft thought? What magic stooped and touched it once, long ago? Surely a god walked here once. But what god? One of Earth, or one from beyond even the stars?</p>
    <p>Silently, he let Vann urge him along the path. The sooner he reached his destination, the sooner his questions might be answered.</p>
    <p>But the monotony of the journey grew tiring at last. Once a castle, a small structure compared to Parror's fortress, was visible under the shelter of the forest, but the soldiers by-passed it without a glance. Raft eyed the scar-faced Vann.</p>
    <p>"How much further have we to go?"</p>
    <p>"It is still a long way."</p>
    <p>He was right. The hours dragged past, and Raft's occasional glances at his wristwatch made him conscious of a puzzling new factor. They must have covered more than fifteen miles, but his watch said that only fifteen minutes had passed. Overhead that brightness in the green vault had not moved. The sun, apparently, stood still over Paititi.</p>
    <p>Nor had it moved when, a long while later, they came out of the forest at the edge of a mile-wide clearing--or what seemed to be a clearing.</p>
    <p>Directly ahead, blocking the way, stood a turreted palace that would have seemed huge except for the trees that dwarfed it. Even so, it was an enormous structure.</p>
    <p>What lay beyond it Raft could not see, but he could make out a shapeless pale cloud that hung in the sky beyond those thrusting pinnacles, a formless whiteness that seethed and curled slowly into new suggestions of luminous hugeness.</p>
    <p>A broad river ran toward the castle, and under it. The torrent plunged into a high-arched opening beneath that architectural colossus, and was lost.</p>
    <p>Raft was stumbling and exhausted. The two long journeys, first through the underground tube that led to Paititi, and then this fast hike, had turned his muscles to water. He was so utterly tired by now that he saw his destination through a sort of mist; and Vann's voice came from a long distance away. He let himself be urged forward, mechanically moving his legs to keep up with the soldiers.</p>
    <p>There was a courtyard. Figures moved about it. A throng of brightly clad figures, with the half-Egyptian faces of the cat-people, all intent on the spectacle in their midst. A high-pitched singing came from a man crouching atop a high stone block.</p>
    <p>Exultant wildness shrilled out as he chanted a song in the language Raft did not understand. The crouching man played some complicated string instrument that sounded vaguely like the bagpipes.</p>
    <p>In the center of the courtyard two men were fighting. One was a giant, tall, smoothly-muscled, with a strong face already masked by blood. The other man was more remarkable. Raft's eyes were drawn to him.</p>
    <p>He was like Parror, and yet unlike. In place of the sleek, powerful look of the puma, this man was as lithe and swift as the hunting cheetahs of the old Hindu rajahs.</p>
    <p>Supple and light, his hair a fine mist about that strong, delicate face, the man sprang out of his opponent's way, laughing, and slashed down with claws.</p>
    <p>He wore a glove, a gauntlet, that was tipped with three curved metal blades like talons. Needle-sharp they were, for three long cuts opened like mouths across the larger man's bare chest, and blood spouted.</p>
    <p>The minstrel's song rose to a thin shrilling in which there was something drunken and almost mad. The music sang and sang. It cried of love and death, and in it was the choking, musty smell of fresh blood.</p>
    <p>Turn and dodge and slay.</p>
    <p>Metal grated as the two taloned gloves clawed together. The men bounded apart as though on springs instead of muscles of flesh. The giant shook his head, wiping crimson from his eyes. The other paused, with a careless gesture, to glance at Raft. His irises were blazing yellow. He had slit-like pupils.</p>
    <p>His blond hair, almost orange, was oddly marked by shadowy patterns of cloudy black. As he smiled, Raft almost expected to see the sharp teeth of a predatory leopard. Red droplets fell from those murderous gauntlets to a brown thigh. He called a question.</p>
    <p>Vann answered, and the yellow-haired man lifted one shoulder impatiently. He spoke a few casual syllables, and turned back to the giant, lifting a taloned glove.</p>
    <p>For answer his opponent leaped in, and the two agile figures were again lost in that deadly, graceful dance. Vann, his eyes glowing, touched Raft's arm.</p>
    <p>"Come. You must sleep now."</p>
    <p>Raft's brief excitement had died. The dull stupor of exhaustion made a protective barrier around Raft. Without another glance at the duel, he went with Vann through a portal, along halls and up spiraling ramps, lost in a foggy dimness of sheer physical tiredness. He felt Vann's hand halt him at last.</p>
    <p>"Sleep, now. Darum will see you after you've rested."</p>
    <p>"Darum?" Raft saw cushions at his feet, and dropped heavily upon them. "Who's Darum?"</p>
    <p>"You just saw him fighting. He is the Great Lord. He rules. But now he fights, and after that--"</p>
    <p>Vann's voice died away, merging with the faint, drowsy humming of--of what?</p>
    <p>A purring, sub-sonic vibration thrilled through Raft. Deep, comforting it throbbed through the very structure of the castle. As though the castle lived. As though the hidden pulse of life stirred in the stone.</p>
    <p>That alien whisper lulled Raft to sleep.</p>

     <p>MAD KING</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>MANY HOURS LATER, Raft awoke, refreshed but stiff and aching. Colored light came through tall windows, pastel patterns that shifted and glowed on the pallor of the thick carpet.</p>
    <p>He was in what seemed to be a sleeping-chamber. There were mirrors on the walls, many of them, and the room, he noticed, had no corners. It was a silken, padded nest, strewn carelessly with silks and pillows, and with low, round couches here and there.</p>
    <p>There was an oval door in the wall, but no shadow loomed against it. That did not, however, mean that there was no guard. Raft yawned, stretched, and felt his muscles and joints crackle with stiffness. But, aside from various dull aches, he felt alert and ravenously hungry.</p>
    <p>The dim humming still vibrated through him. He turned to the window, pushed open a pane, and stepped out onto the balustraded porch beyond. There he paused, staring.</p>
    <p>Overhead the sun had moved a fraction--that was all. He saw it vaguely, for a towering pillar of mist dimmed his vision. Looking down, he understood the reason.</p>
    <p>Beneath him a gulf opened. The porch overhung a broad platform lower down which jutted out over an abyss clouded with white fog. A silver torrent of ice shot out in an arc and fell away into that incredible depth.</p>
    <p>Not ice, no, for it moved slowly. It was the river that flowed beneath the castle, to drop into the gulf that lay directly under Raft. He tried to probe the depths, but the boiling maelstrom of mist baffled him. The cataract fell and was lost.</p>
    <p>Fell--slowly. Mist rose slowly too, a gelid ghost towering high above the castle. The deep humming was louder now, and the stone beneath Raft's feet vibrated to its murmuring. Subsonic. The crashing roar of a waterfall, resolved by some physical warp or distortion into that dim throbbing he felt rather than heard.</p>
    <p>Frowning, Raft left the balcony. He was beginning to understand a little now. His mind, refreshed by deep sleep, was clearer. Slow water, stones that fell like feathers, a sun that dragged itself wearily across that green sky. Time, it seemed, was different here. Was this lost land actually on Earth? The same Earth that held the Amazon Basin, and Rio, and New York? Perhaps not.</p>
    <p>He tried to fathom the mystery of the oval door. He could not, but it slipped upward and vanished suddenly, and Vann stood on the threshold, his scarred face alert.</p>
    <p>"So you're awake," Vann said in the Indio. "Good. Darum wants to see you, but he's resting now. You'll want a bath."</p>
    <p>"And food," Raft said. "Does Darum wear those gloves all the time?"</p>
    <p>Vann called a command over his shoulders. Then he stepped forward into the room, smiling.</p>
    <p>"Only for tourneys. He's less dangerous when he wears the gloves. I'll show you the bath, Craddock."</p>
    <p>"I'm not Craddock. I told you before I'm not Craddock."</p>
    <p>But Vann paid no attention. He moved levers on the wall, and part of the floor slid aside, revealing a shallow, wide basin filled with a liquid the color of creme de menthe. Gratefully Raft slipped out of his ragged clothes and lowered himself into the bath. Vann watched with a grimace of distaste.</p>
    <p>"It'll take several washings to get you clean," he remarked.</p>
    <p>"Here." He found a jar and sprinkled blue powder into the water. An astringent, tingling sensation ran across Raft's skin.</p>
    <p>There were brushes, many of them, instruments like Roman strigils, and other gadgets Raft experimented with under Vann's guidance. The water was awkward to handle because of its sluggishness.</p>
    <p>Once Raft dropped a brush. He watched it float gently down till it dug a hole in the water, a hole that gradually refilled, while ripples crept out to the rim.</p>
    <p>But a bath was luxury, and the aches began to leave Raft's muscles. Vann watched unblinkingly, commenting once on the coarseness of his prisoner's hair, and providing a gleaming unguent which Raft's skin absorbed leaving him stimulated. Finally a page appeared, pushing a wheeled table laden with unfamiliar food, and stood motionless, struck with amazement as he eyed the figure in the bath.</p>
    <p>Vann gestured, and the loose-limbed, dapper youngster, with his daintily malicious triangular face, bowed and fled, without removing his startled gaze from Raft.</p>
    <p>"No wonder he's surprised," Vann remarked. "Your musculature is so different from ours that you looked deformed to him. But I'd like to fight you some time, if opportunity arises."</p>
    <p>"Thanks," Raft said. "You'd have a fine time cutting my throat with one of those gloves."</p>
    <p>"Not at all." Vann smiled savagely. "Killing is a different thing entirely. The point in murder is not to be found out. But a fight, a duel--they're very seldom fatal." He found tight garments like his own and helped Raft don them. "I'd have too much of an advantage if I wore the gloves. What weapons do you use usually?"</p>
    <p>"Rifles," Raft said. He explained about duels.</p>
    <p>"Strange," the soldier said. "I should think there'd be little satisfaction in propelling a missile. You wouldn't be able to feel your blade go in. There'd be.no physical pleasure."</p>
    <p>"All right. We'll box, fight with our fists."</p>
    <p>"Depending on impact alone? That doesn't seem interesting. Don't you use swords at all?"</p>
    <p>"Some of us do," Raft said. "But I'm no swordsman myself. What was that you said about murder? Is homicide legal here?"</p>
    <p>"No," Vann said. "We're not barbarians. A murderer has to pay restitution, if he's found out. But only the stupid are caught."</p>
    <p>"Oh," Raft said blankly, tackling a pulpy, acrid fruit like an orange. "There's a police force, then?"</p>
    <p>He had to explain, but finally Vann understood.</p>
    <p>"We have specialists in detection. If a murderer can escape their skill, he's safe enough. The trick is--I think--to conceal the motive. Killers are caught because they haven't disguised their motives." He shook his head deprecatingly.</p>
    <p>"Just what is the set-up here?" Raft asked. "Does Darum rule all Paititi?"</p>
    <p>Vann nodded.</p>
    <p>"Yes. The set-up is--well, that of any civilized land."</p>
    <p>"Sure. Homicide for fun. How is it you can talk the Indio tongue?"</p>
    <p>"You aren't the first outsider to enter Paititi. We have had brown-skinned men here in our fathers' time, though it has always been difficult for us to leave our valley. Parror's ancestors had captive Indios sometimes, and most of us know the language."</p>
    <p>Raft thought that logical. Linguist ability was a mark of the cosmopolitan, even if it never left this hidden valley.</p>
    <p>"And Portuguese?"</p>
    <p>"What?"</p>
    <p>"Falam portugues?"</p>
    <p>"That is strange to me," Vann admitted.</p>
    <p>"Then Parror picked it up? And Janissa, too." Raft nodded thoughtfully.</p>
    <p>Then he remembered the aviator. "Was there a man of my race here, a man named da Fonseca, who had a machine which flew through the air? About--about fifty sleeps ago?"</p>
    <p>Vann's face lighted up. "The machine that flies fell into Paititi about four hundred sleeps ago, killing all but one man, whom Parror took to his castle. Yes, that was da Fonseca, for with his aid Parror read the notebook you left in the Cavern of the Flame."</p>
    <p>Raft put down a morsel untasted.</p>
    <p>"Four hundred sleeps?" he said, a queer hesitation in his voice. "Over a year ago. How long have I been in Paititi, Vann?"</p>
    <p>"I captured you yesterday," the soldier said. "And that was</p>
    <p>directly after your arrival. I was watching for Parror's return from the outer world. So I knew when to strike."</p>
    <p>"I see," Raft said, though he didn't. "What about this notebook, and the Cavern of the Flame? What's that?"</p>
    <p>"You did not see the Cavern?"</p>
    <p>"I saw a cavern, with some unpleasant creatures in it. Is that what you mean?"</p>
    <p>A shudder shook Vann. Briefly a touch of fear showed in his eyes. "No--no. That is not what I mean." He changed the subject abruptly. "You must see Darum now. Are you ready?"</p>
    <p>"As ready as I ever will be, I suppose."</p>
    <p>"Very well." Vann stood up, turning toward the door. Raft accompanied his guard into a dimly-lighted hall and along it. After a while Vann broke silence.</p>
    <p>"The Great Lord has fought and had his pleasure afterward, and slept. He will be strange now. A word of advice, Crad-dock."</p>
    <p>"I'm--well, what is it?"</p>
    <p>"Something hangs in the balance now," Vann said thoughtfully, his gaze on the floor as they walked. "For myself, I arn not sure. I am on neither side as yet. Darum, too, hesitates.</p>
    <p>"He had you taken from Parror before the--the final step could be taken, but he may yet side with Parror. If he does, that will be well for you. Or perhaps evil, in the end. I cannot see that far ahead. But I will say this, since you are of an alien race, you would do well to heed it. Darum--is mad."</p>
    <p>A little shock went through Raft. He stared at the soldier.</p>
    <p>"Mad? Your king?"</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>"And he rules?"</p>
    <p>"Of course," Vann said. "Why not? For often he is not mad, and when he is, that does not matter much. But with you it may mean the difference between life and death. Perhaps," he went on musingly, "life and death for Paititi. Remember that Darum is not your kind."</p>
    <p>"I hope not," Raft said candidly.</p>
    <p>"He is of our kind," Vann murmured, and his eyes were luminous. "Now--I hope you live. For I'd enjoy a duel with you, Craddock. And here is your way." He held aside a heavy tapestry, revealing a dim corridor. "Go in."</p>
    <p>"Thanks," Raft said.</p>
    <p>He stepped forward. Behind him, Vann let the curtain fall. There was silence, except for the never-ceasing vibration that shook the castle. Even here its steady humming could be felt.</p>
    <p>Raft walked toward another drapery that barred the way ahead.</p>
    <p>A different race, he thought, and a different species. They murder for intellectual pleasure and duel for physical excitement. They see nothing amiss in a mad king.</p>
    <p>He hesitated before the curtain. Then he pushed it aside and stepped through, into a ruddy darknenss.</p>
    <p>The dim, faint glow came from all around. How large the room might be Raft had no way of guessing. He saw shrouded shapes looming before him, and, in heavier shadow, something stirred and looked at him with eyes that were glowing disks. A cool, sharp perfume was in his nostrils. That infernal humming seemed to shake the dark air.</p>
    <p>There was no sound. Raft, after a moment, moved forward. The eyes watched him steadily. At last he could make out a slim figure reclining on a bulkier, shapeless mass--the smooth outline of a jaw, and the cloudy mist of hair fading into invisibility.</p>
    <p>Raft stood there, waiting.</p>
    <p>He sensed that this was not the same man he had seen fighting and laughing in the courtyard. There was a difference, even physically. In the gloom a change had come upon Darum, a strangeness that was indefinable and yet unmistakable.</p>
    <p>"Sit down," the king said, in the Indio tongue. Even his voice had altered. It was passionless, like music heard from very far away.</p>
    <p>Raft fumbled, found a couch, and dropped upon it. The eyes had a touch of green in them as they watched.</p>
    <p>"Listen," Darum said.</p>
    <p>At the king's feet a shadow stirred. Its soft curves were those of a woman, but from that vague figure a subtle breath of terror breathed out, chilling Raft. There was a sound, almost a voice. Woodwind and sighing strings--plaintive, questioning.</p>
    <p>Again the king spoke.</p>
    <p>"Yrann wonders. She wonders why you come to Paititi, Craddock. Music is her voice, for she will not speak. But she asks who are you? What is your world?"</p>
    <p>The soft strings sang again. Sang a question.</p>
    <p>Raft leaned forward, as though to break the spell. But the king's eyes held him.</p>
    <p>"He is a god, Yrann. Craddock was in the beginning, and now he comes again, very near the end. Since his eyes first saw Paititi, a race has been born and draws close to the shadow. The shadow that the Flame casts over all living things."</p>
    <p>The sighing oboe-flute spoke of a gathering darkness, of a cloud that stooped above the land,</p>
    <p>"And yet there are other shadows," the king whispered. "There was a woman once, Yrann, whose loveliness burned like magic fires. Fires that could make men drunken. A fire that could make men mad, as I know. As I know."</p>
    <p>Stealthy fear circled Raft's heart. Poignant, eerie, the music sang, and the dim gloom showed the half-seen, half-veiled curves of soft skin and rounded shoulders. At Darum's feet Yrann swept slim fingers across sobbing strings.</p>
    <p>"And the fire burned," the king went on softly. "In all Paititi there was none so beautiful as this woman. When she danced, th'e tall trees inclined in homage. When she smiled, the stones bowed down."</p>
    <p>A note of pride crept into the wordless song. The sundrenched spring of green forests came into the dark chamber; the sound of laughter, and flaunting bright cloaks, and clashing steel. The music pirouetted into a gay, lilting dance.</p>
    <p>Heavily the king's voice broke in. The music sank to a whisper.</p>
    <p>"There was a man who loved this woman. He took her for his own. And she laughed. Laughed--knowing power as well as beauty, growing drunken at the thought of ruling Paititi. Of ruling the man who was the king."</p>
    <p>Proud, triumphant, the song rose. Ivory arms gleamed.</p>
    <p>"And her eyes fell upon a man who was not a king. But she knew that in her arms, any man might be the emperor of the universe, and the equal of the gods. Nor was she wrong. If her embrace meant death, death would be sweet poison."</p>
    <p>Tinkling, mocking laughter, and an undertone of sadness in the music now.</p>
    <p>"She was faithless," the king said, his words falling heavily as stones into the still air. "Those lips were faithless. And the arms of Yrann sought another, and the white body of Yrann yearned too."</p>
    <p>The song hushed almost to silence.</p>
    <p>"Long ago. Very long ago. Now she is no longer faithless. Nor is the king sorrowful. Maidens dance before him. They ask his love, but he has none to give. His love is for Yrann, most beautiful of all womankind, and she--she loves him now."</p>
    <p>Tender, obedient, the oboe murmured softly.</p>
    <p>"But the king is mad," the quiet, cool voice said, and the music died into stillness. "There was a red hour long ago when the madness entered into him. That hour will not pass, Yrann, and love and madness dwell forever side by side."</p>
    <p>For a long time, there was no sound but the faint vibration of the cataract making the castle tremble in its iron grip.</p>
    <p>"We speak together, Yrann and I, of things forgotten and things that are not forgotten," the king said at last. "But music is her tongue now." His voice changed. "Yrann must not die, though Paititi does. I think that you hold a certain answer in your hand, Craddock, and whether I let you open your grip upon that great secret is something I cannot tell yet. We must talk first. There are many questions."</p>
    <p>For the first time Raft spoke. He moistened his lips.</p>
    <p>"One question has to be settled first," he said.</p>
    <p>"And that is?"</p>
    <p>"I'm not Craddock."</p>
    <p>The eyes watched him. Raft plunged on.</p>
    <p>"I tried to tell your soldier, Vann, but he didn't believe me. I don't know what story Parror had. It must have been a good one. For Craddock's in Parror's castle now, his captive. I came here to rescue Dan Craddock. and my name is Brian Raft."</p>
    <p>"I cannot believe that."</p>
    <p>"Why should I lie?" Raft asked. "What could I gain?"</p>
    <p>"You might have many reasons. And yet Parror is clever too. If he had wanted to gain time, he might use deception."</p>
    <p>"Janissa knows who I am. The girl in Parror's castle."</p>
    <p>"But will Janissa speak the truth?" Darum asked. "Her mind is like a wind, changing and changing. Tell me your story, then. It may be a lie, or it may not. But I will listen."</p>
    <p>Raft talked. He marshaled his thoughts as clearly as he could, though the ruddy dimness of the room played strange tricks on his nerves. When he had finished, the glowing eyes of King Darum were half-closed.</p>
    <p>"Go," Darum said.</p>
    <p>Raft hesitated. The deep voice sounded again, more com-mandingly.</p>
    <p>"Go, I said. We will speak again later. Now I must test your story."</p>
    <p>Raft stood up. From the half-glimpsed figure at Darum's feet that exotic, haunting music breathed out again. Caressing, gentle, and indefinably sad.</p>
    <p>The king's eyes watched him.</p>
    <p>Stumbling, Raft moved across the chamber. He felt the velvet folds of the curtain against his face. He lifted it, stepped under its soft drape. Behind him light flared. The music rose shrilly. Raft half-turned.</p>
    <p>On a dais strewn with cushions Darum was standing, his face hidden as he looked down at the figure at his feet. Nor had Raft's guess been wrong as to the loveliness of those ivory limbs, that half-veiled beautiful body. But Yrann's face was not veiled.</p>
    <p>And her face was--horror.</p>
    <p>Into Raft's mind flashed unbidden memory of the cruel-taloned gauntlet he had seen on the king's hand. Something terrible and savage and mad had destroyed the beauty of Yrann's face, leaving her goddess body untouched.</p>
    <p>The king looked up. His eyes met Raft's.</p>
    <p>Raft stepped backward into the corridor and let the shielding curtain fall into place.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER VII.</p>
     <p>DREAD FLAME</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>HIS WATCH said minutes had passed, but Raft knew that it had been hours since his interview with the lord of Paititi. Impatiently he waited in his apartment, left alone with his puzzled thoughts. He could not fathom the trick of the door, and Vann, after escorting him back here, had not reappeared. From the balustraded porch nothing could be seen but the torrent pouring lazily into the abyss below.</p>
    <p>The room was sterile. It was beautiful, luxurious, but it held nothing that aroused Raft's interest. Inaction was twanging his nerves into tense irritability. He seemed the only thing not frozen into semi-stasis in this strange land.</p>
    <p>A long time had passed when from beyond the window he heard his name called softly. He knew the voice. A stir of excitement quickened him as he hastily stepped out on the balcony. But there was nothing.</p>
    <p>Only falling water. Lazy falling water.</p>
    <p>"Brian!" The low call came again. "Brian Raft!"</p>
    <p>He leaned over the rail, and found himself looking down into the soft, familiar face of Janissa. The aquamarine eyes were darker now, almost purple. She was clinging to grips and footholds on the castle's wall, crannies where it seemed not even a squirrel could find lodgment.</p>
    <p>Catching his breath, Raft leaned down, extending his arm. But Janissa murmured a quick warning.</p>
    <p>"Get a cushion, Brian. Bring it. No, I'm safe enough here. Do as I say."</p>
    <p>He hesitated, turned, and hurried back into the room, where he snatched up the nearest cushion and carried it out with him. Janissa had not moved. Her slim body was flattened against the stone.</p>
    <p>"Hold it by a corner. Yes, that's it. And lower it toward me, very carefully. Don't lose your grip on it."</p>
    <p>Raft obeyed. There was a sudden whir and a flash of steel, and the cushion was almost torn from his hand. From the smooth wall beneath the railing a fan of sharp blades had leaped out, one of them impaling the pillow as Janissa's flesh would have been pierced had she continued her climb.</p>
    <p>Her teeth showed in a smile.</p>
    <p>"Now it's safe, I think. Give me your hand." With feline agility she clambered up, writhing between the swords so that no blade or edge touched her. On the balcony she shook herself, patted her hair, and took the cushion from Raft.</p>
    <p>"You're alone? I thought you would be. I asked questions before trying this climb."</p>
    <p>"You might have been killed," Raft said, looking down into dizzying emptiness where the slow cataract poured into bottomless deeps and the slower mist wreathed up in a swaying tower; Then he turned to the girl and, as he met her smile, he felt a little dizziness that did not come from vertigo.</p>
    <p>This was the face that had drawn him over miles of river and jungle almost as unerringly as Craddock's trail had drawn him. No one, he thought, could have looked once upon this delicate, soft, malicious little creature and not wanted to look again.</p>
    <p>In their first meeting he had been tired and bewildered. Today he could gaze more clearly into the aquamarine eyes and the gay, yet prim face of this contradictory girl. He stared frankly, trying to make the clear gaze waver.</p>
    <p>Janissa laughed.</p>
    <p>"We've met before, remember?" she jibed.</p>
    <p>Raft grinned.</p>
    <p>"Sorry. It was just--Do your people here know how beautiful you are?"</p>
    <p>"Men of all races must be very much alike," Janissa parried demurely. "We must think about you just now, Brian Raft. You're in trouble."</p>
    <p>"Trouble you walked out on, I remember." He did not mean to let her attractiveness blind him to that memory.</p>
    <p>She shrugged lithely.</p>
    <p>"What could I do then? Now I've walked in again, and you must forgive me."</p>
    <p>He glanced over the balcony rail and shuddered. "You certainly did take a long chance. Lucky you weren't killed."</p>
    <p>"Not by a fall. Not my race! Though if you hadn't been here to spring the trap, I might have had some trouble. Let's go in. We may be seen from another balcony."</p>
    <p>She stepped through the window, stared around, and tossed the slashed cushion away. "Now we can talk."</p>
    <p>Raft followed her, seeing how supple was the movement of her round, smooth limbs as they glided beneath velvety garments. She tilted him a sweetly wicked smile over one shoulder and shook the cloudy tiger-striped hair. There was a mound of silken cushions against the nearer wall. She laid a hand on Raft's arm and drew him down beside her to a cross-legged seat among them.</p>
    <p>"We have much to tell each other," she said. "And perhaps not a very long time to do it in."</p>
    <p>"You'll have to start, then. Remember, I don't know anything at all."</p>
    <p>"I suppose not," Janissa murmured. There was a soft roughness to her voice when she lowered it, a luxuriant roughness, like a purr. "Not even Craddock knew, really, though he--created--our race. And now he does not remember certain things. So Parror will have to build a device that--"</p>
    <p>"Suppose you start at the beginning," Raft interrupted her. "First, where is Paititi? On my own planet?"</p>
    <p>"Yes. We know that, for some of us have gone through the unseen road to the jungle land outside. Not many, and only guardians, like Parror and myself. I went once and only once. It was horrible. Your world is frozen. Nothing moves.</p>
    <p>"When we meet others outside, you know, we have to force ourselves to do everything as slowly as people in a nightmare. Otherwise we'd be only a blur when they looked at us. But we cannot live long outside Paititi, unless we carry something of the Flame with us."</p>
    <p>"The Flame?" Raft echoed. "The Flame?"</p>
    <p>"The Flame is the source of all life," Janissa said soberly. "In our whole land there are only two amulets that hold a little fiery seed of the Flame itself. We do not know how to make them. These two are very old, our heritage from the ancient race that lived here before us." Her eyes narrowed. "Parror has one. I should have the other. It's my right as Guardian. But the king claims it, and--well, never mind. I have my plans. The time is coming when--"</p>
    <p>"Please," Raft broke in. "First tell me about this business 'of speed, and your people moving faster than ours. Why?"</p>
    <p>"The Flame is sinking," Janissa said in a somber voice. "That is why Parror sought out Craddock. You see, Paititi was not always as it is now. In the old days, generations lived and died during the day, and other generations in a night. And before that, hundreds of generations in a day. The cycle slows now. Water moves faster than in the days of our fathers. Our memories go back a long way. We have written records, but certain things we had to guess. Before we were human, long, long ago, another race dwelt in Paititi.</p>
    <p>"That race built these castles. Men and women not of our species but akin to yours, strong and wise and happy, dwelt in this land and lived beneath the Flame. Then the Flame sank and slept."</p>
    <p>Raft scowled.</p>
    <p>"That race died?"</p>
    <p>"It did not die."</p>
    <p>"What happened to it?"</p>
    <p>She looked away.</p>
    <p>"As you came through the unseen road, you must have seen a cavern there--a dark place where things crept and flew in shadow. You saw the monsters that dwelt in it. Those things--their ancestors--built this castle, and Parror's castle, and a hundred others. But as the Flame sank, they sank below the level of beasts. We know that now. But we did not always know."</p>
    <p>Raft tried to marshal the facts. "The first race degenerated, eh? As your own evolved?"</p>
    <p>"They degenerated long before we had the first glimmers of intelligence. I said that the Flame slept. Craddock wakened it, millions and millions of cycles ago. We know that, because our ancestors penetrated to the cave of the Flame, and found certain things there--a cloth sack, metal containers, a notebook with symbols we could not read.</p>
    <p>"Not until da Fonseca came here, in his machine that flew, did we have any knowledge of the real truth, though we had often theorized. Parror and I took da Fonseca and through him learned the contents of that notebook."</p>
    <p>"Millions of cycles? Craddock isn't that old!"</p>
    <p>"The tides of time are altered in Paititi," Janissa said. "Craddock awakened the Flame, and our race was given birth. Now the Flame sinks, and that means great evil."</p>
    <p>Dan Craddock! How much did he really know about the man, Raft wondered. For thirty years the Welshman had wandered the Amazon Basin. Why? Because of some secret he had stumbled on, long ago?</p>
    <p>"What is this Flame?" he asked.</p>
    <p>Janissa made a curious symbolic gesture. "It is the giver of life and the taker-away of life. It is Curupuri."</p>
    <p>Raft stared at her. "All right, leave that, then. What do you want?"</p>
    <p>The eyes shaded to purple again. "I am of royal blood. In the old days there were once three kings, enemies. They fought, and two were conquered. But the two vanquished kings were not shamed. They were given the hereditary honor of guardians of the Flame. They dwelt, after that, in the castle Parror holds now, while the conqueror dwelt in this place, by Doirada Gulf. It was so for generations. Until now!"</p>
    <p>She seemed to bristle.</p>
    <p>"Parror uses me--uses me! And I am of blood no less royal than his own. I held the secret of the lens, which he needed, but now that he has Craddock, he can waken the Flame, and I will be stripped of my birthright." Her eyes glowed. "Holding the castle of the Flame is a trust. We guard. Parror intends to break the trust, and act on his own, without waiting for the king's decision. That will be a shameful thing. It will bring shame on me, one qf the guardians."</p>
    <p>"Yet you helped him murder da Fonseca," Raft said. "You helped him kidnap Craddock."</p>
    <p>"As for the murder, I did not know he intended that. The spell of the mirror can be broken, but it must be done slowly, carefully, or the victim will die. I had no love for da Fonseca, yet I did not want his death, and I would have stopped Parror could I have done so.</p>
    <p>"Craddock--well, Parror lied to me. He told me he would do no more than bring Craddock here. I would not have trusted his word alone, but he gave me logic I could not deny. False logic, I know now. For he will get the knowledge he needs from Craddock's brain, and waken the Flame. That--that--" She hesitated. "It may be a very great sin. I am no longer sure what is the right way, Brian."</p>
    <p>"Well, one way is for me to get out of here and see Crad-dock," Raft said practically.</p>
    <p>"I cannot get you out--yet," she told him. "But the rest is easy. I have the mirror. See?" She drew the little lens from her bosom and held it out. Raft, remembering da Fonseca, found himself instinctively glancing away.</p>
    <p>Janissa laughed softly.</p>
    <p>"There's no harm in it, unless the psychic cleavage is violent. Look into my mirror."</p>
    <p>"Not so fast," Raft said. "How does it work?"</p>
    <p>"We know much of the mind," Janissa said. "The device is--is a mental bridge. Once it has caught the matrix of a man's mind, it can be put en rapport with that man. Each brain has a different basic vibration. You could not use the mirror alone, Brian, for it needs a trained mind to direct. But with my aid, you can. Look."</p>
    <p>He obeyed. In the tiny lens the gray storm-clouds misted and swirled. They were driven aside. Tiny and alive, Raft saw the face of Dan Craddock.</p>
    <p>He had a stubbly white beard. His eyes were bloodshot, and he looked utterly exhausted. Beyond him Raft could make out vague outlines. Silks, he thought, of many colors.</p>
    <p>"He is alone, and resting," Janissa whispered. "So you may speak with him freely."</p>
    <p>"Speak?"</p>
    <p>"In the mind. Look closer now, while I summon him."</p>
    <p>Raft stared down at the lens. He saw Craddock's gaze lift, and sudden awareness spring into them.</p>
    <p>Raft heard his name!</p>
    <p>He did not hear it. He sensed the impact of Craddock's thought. Abruptly he was conscious of nothing but his friend's presence. The room about him darkened and vanished. There was present only the odd feeling that Janissa was here, somewhere, alive and guiding.</p>
    <p>"Dan. Are you all right?" His thought formed words.</p>
    <p>"All right, Brian. Yes. You?"</p>
    <p>"So far I'm alive, anyway," Raft thought grimly. "Janissa's here."</p>
    <p>"Good. She managed to tell me a little. And Parror's told me more."</p>
    <p>"Is he--has he tried any tricks?"</p>
    <p>Craddock grinned wanly.</p>
    <p>"More or less. He's the most dangerous altruist I've ever met. You shouldn't have come after me, Brian."</p>
    <p>"You should have told me the set-up back in the hospital, when Parror first showed up," Raft pointed out. "But that's water under the bridge. What we've got to figure on now--"</p>
    <p>"I didn't know," Craddock interrupted. "When Parror brought da Fonseca to the hospital, I hadn't the least idea what was going on. When he showed me my notebook, I was--well, as flabbergasted as I looked."</p>
    <p>"You were here before, though."</p>
    <p>"Yes. I was here. Thirty years ago by our time, a hundred million, maybe, by Paititi's time. For it's variable. There's the Flame..."</p>
    <p>"Tell him," Janissa's thought urged.</p>
    <p>Craddock nodded.</p>
    <p>"Yes, I--I'd better, I suppose. Though thirty years ago I hadn't much idea what I was getting into. I was pretty young. I was on the trail of the secret medicines the Indio witch-doctors were supposed to have around here, and that's how I stumbled on the unseen road. It wasn't closed then. It lay wide open. A trap, as it proved."</p>
    <p>"A trap?"</p>
    <p>"One set by fate," Craddock thought grimly. "I went on, though, past the cavern of the monsters, and to the place where the road forks. One branch leads to Paititi. The other leads to the thing the Indios call Curupuri."</p>
    <p>"The Flame," Raft supplemented. "What is it?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know. Radiant energy of some kind. It may be alive. It may not. But certainly it's nothing that ever was spawned on this earth. Paititi's a meteoric crater, Brian, and I mink Curupuri came to this planet in a meteor. Perhaps it was the meteor. It's--life."</p>
    <p>"The creator and the destroyer," Janissa put in quietly.</p>
    <p>"Destroyer? Yes. There are forms of energy we know nothing about. Sometimes we see them through telescopes, in the giant nebulae light-years away. The stuff of primal energy, spawned in interstellar space, where that tremendous force can safely exist. It can't exist--safely--on a planet. Not unless the planet is still gaseous, still molten. Curupuri, the thing that fell on Brazil in a meteor ages ago, is a source of life, Brian."</p>
    <p>"A living thing?"</p>
    <p>"Too colossal for us to conceive of or measure. You know the Arrhennius theory, that life reached Earth in the form of spores, drifting through space on light-pressure tides. Well, that's fair enough, but what gave life to those spores?</p>
    <p>"It's the old chicken or the egg problem, with a difference. The spores may have been the dust, the waste-products of things like the nebulae. Or that vast force raging in space may have had power to create life in dust, a galaxy away. I don't know. I'm theorizing, that's all. But radiant energy, vibration, power--they're tied up with it, somehow."</p>
    <p>Craddock's tired face brightened.</p>
    <p>"And the merest fraction of that energy fell on Earth once, in a meteor. It must have been a microscopic amount, for anything more would have devastated the planet. Growth, unchecked. I guessed some of that, and learned a little more, from records I found in Paititi."</p>
    <p>"Records? Left by whom?"</p>
    <p>"I didn't know then. There was no one in the valley, no life except birds and insects, peccary, tapir, and the jaguars. Remember the jaguars, Brian. They're important. Meanwhile, I found those records in what is now Parror's castle.</p>
    <p>"They weren't unlike the written Indio language. I suppose that's where the Indies get their lingo in the first place. Anyway, I found out the truth. Curupuri had given life to Paititi. The merest touch of that energy has made the Amazon Basin the most fertile and prolific place on Earth."</p>
    <p>Raft nodded.</p>
    <p>"Keep going. How does this trick work?"</p>
    <p>"In cycles. There are cycles in suns, giants and dwarfs, and in nebulae too, though our lives are too short to comprehend them. When the Flame is at full tide, a certain type of energy pours forth from it. The result is peculiar."</p>
    <p>"Time is speeded up?"</p>
    <p>Slowly Craddock shook his head. "No. Not objectively. What happens is a metabolic change. The rate of growth is tremendously increased. Not only in men, in mammals, but in all living things. When the Flame is at the top of its cycle, a man may be born, live a complete life, and die in one'second. Yet it will be a lifetime to him.</p>
    <p>"Inanimate things are not affected, of course. The radiation won't make stone crumble faster. It influences living cells only. The animal world, and plants. That is what happened."</p>
    <p>"The Flame wakened," Janissa supplemented. "And in its light all things sprang to life."</p>
    <p>"Yes. Long ago. But that cycle was more normal. The First Race, the one that built these castles, Jived here, evolved, and--and then the Flame sank. They did not die. But apparently the radiation is a false stimulus.</p>
    <p>"When the Flame's power falls below a certain level, its rays are actively malignant. Cellular tissue may be stimulated, but it can also become cancerous. When the Flame sinks, there is a retrogression. It's freakish. It's--horrible."</p>
    <p>"I saw what was left of the First Race," Raft mentioned. "Those monsters in the cavern."</p>
    <p>"Yes. They saw their fate coming, and made plans. They were skilled scientists. They found a way to rekindle the Flame before its cycle had been run, but they failed to do it. Because it was dangerous. If they were not accurate to a hair's breadth, if they failed to control the Flame exactly, it would mean total destruction. The radiation would rage out unchecked. The Flame would devour itself instantly, but in that instant Paititi would be seared lifeless."</p>
    <p>"They didn't do it, then."</p>
    <p>"No. They waited. Each generation thought it could live out its own span. Each generation let the problem go on to its children. And the children thought the same. In the end, the beast-minds were too dull to comprehend.</p>
    <p>"The creatures that had been the First Race remembered only the Flame, and they found their way to the cavern where you saw them. Their nearness to the radiation keeps them alive, and they've lived and bred there in the dark for a long time."</p>
    <p>Raft frowned.</p>
    <p>"But the cat-people. How did they come into being?"</p>
    <p>Craddock's eyes held a touch of deep horror. "I created them. I--wakened the Flame."</p>

     <p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>
     <p>KHARN, THE TERRIBLE</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>VISUALIZING THAT SCENE of thirty years ago, Raft could picture a younger Craddock lost in wonder before the secrets he had uncovered, feeling a dangerous exaltation burning in his mind, and, of all the world, the only man who knew of that tremendous, intergalactic Force that blazed hidden in the jungles. Yes, he could understand why Craddock might have been tempted to meddle with forbidden forces.</p>
    <p>"I wakened the Flame. The records I had found, they told the way. I couldn't understand all of it, but I understood enough. Too much. That was when --" Craddock held up his maimed hands --</p>
    <p>"I succeeded and I failed," Craddock continued. "For the Flame wakened raging with power, too much power, though it was far beneath its--maximum. I was lucky to escape as I did."</p>
    <p>The worn face held horror again.</p>
    <p>"Against that flaming terror I watched my hands change. I saw the living flesh alter. I saw human tissues writhe and blacken into something that was--was a blasphemy, Brian. Even as I ran, I could feel those--things--where my fingers had been. I could feel them--writhing!"</p>
    <p>He drew a deep breath, went on more steadily.</p>
    <p>"I escaped into the jungle, and there I amputated--those horrors. I had my surgical kit. There wasn't sulfa in those days, but I managed. I thought then I'd never go back to Paititi. My career was ruined, of course; my hands were--not hands.</p>
    <p>"Yet something kept me in the Amazon Basin. I was too close to the Flame once; part of it touched me, and I could never leave Brazil after that. Sometimes I thought I could hear Curupuri in the Jutahy drums."</p>
    <p>He nodded.</p>
    <p>"Then I did hear it, after thirty years. Parror brought something of the Flame with him when he came down the river, and the Indios sensed it. That incredible vitality sent its message through the jungle. When I saw Parror for the first time, in the hospital, I felt that same life-energy I had found in Paititi. It was faint, but I couldn't mistake it. I was afraid.</p>
    <p>"Parror came to me in the laboratory and gave me my notebook. He'd traced me through that. There's the woods-telegraph, and he knew my name. He'd left Paititi on a crazy chance, hoping I was still alive, hoping to find me.</p>
    <p>"And he succeeded. He told me I must come back to Paititi with him, and of course I said no. Then you came along the hospital hall."</p>
    <p>"I remember." Raft nodded. "But you were alone in the lab."</p>
    <p>"Remember Parror's faster metabolism. He could move at tremendous speed when he wanted to, in our slower world. He had to restrict himself and do everything in slow motion when we were watching. He simply ran out so fast you couldn't see him. Later, he hypnotized me with his mirror. Though I knew what I was doing, I couldn't help myself. Not till I woke here in his castle. Now I know the truth, but I'm helpless."</p>
    <p>"What is the truth? You mean the cat-people evolved in thirty years from primitives?"</p>
    <p>"From the jaguars of the valley," Craddock supplemented. "But it was not merely thirty years. Thirty million or billion, with the radiations pouring out from the Flame. Remember I told you a man could have a lifetime in a second? What took place in our world over a period of eons, happened in Paititi in three decades. The metabolism, the life-rate, was speeded up so enormously that the jaguars evolved in hours or days to savages. And thence to reasoning beings. Their paws became hands.</p>
    <p>"They learned to walk upright. If we could have looked down on Paititi from above, in those times, we could have seen the shapes actually flowing, living flesh melting and changing." He paused, glancing at his hands.</p>
    <p>"Yes," he went on, after a time. "The cat-people evolved and became intelligent. They created a culture of their own based on the older culture that had preceded them. The other life-forms in the valley reached dead ends. Only one species becomes dominant in any milieu. Here it was the cat.</p>
    <p>"Only lately, the Flame has begun to sink again. When I wakened it, I gave it an artificial stimulus, and its flare-up will die as swiftly. In another generation or two, it will sink beneath the danger-level, and then the malignant radiations that destroyed the First Race will come pouring out."</p>
    <p>Quickly Raft sucked in his breath. "I see. I'm getting it now, finally."</p>
    <p>"Yes. That's why Parror abducted me. Because the records of the First Race that held the secret of the Flame no longer exist. I left them in the cavern then, and they were destroyed by that horror. As I would have been destroyed if I'd stayed longer. Parror thought I knew how to waken the Flame."</p>
    <p>"Don't you?"</p>
    <p>"I could not understand all the records," Craddock admitted. "I told you that. I can waken the Flame, but I can't control it. That's the danger."</p>
    <p>"Not even Parror will risk that," Janissa suggested. "Until he finds the knowledge he seeks, he won't take chances."</p>
    <p>Craddock gestured urgently. "Someone is coming. Parror, I think."</p>
    <p>Janissa touched the mirror. "We can speak no more, then, until he is gone. But tell him nothing, Craddock."</p>
    <p>"How can I? the man asked. Then gray clouds blotted out his face.</p>
    <p>Raft leaned back, realizing that he was sweating and exhausted. Janissa watched him sympathetically.</p>
    <p>"It is not an easy road unless you know the way," she told him. "But it is a road we must take again."</p>
    <p>"Yeah. I'd like to get my hands on Parror personally. Or see him in my rifle-sights."</p>
    <p>"Perhaps you will, later." The cat-face was somber. "You see, there is still danger. Craddock did not understand all the old records, but he read them."</p>
    <p>"So?"</p>
    <p>"The memory is in his mind. It is forgotten now, hidden away, but it is not lost. Such memories can be recovered. And if they are, Parror will know how to use the wisdom of the First Race."</p>
    <p>"He can dig up Craddock's memories, eh? Mnemonics--hypnosis, I suppose."</p>
    <p>"Not easily." The girl looked troubled. "He is working on a device that will aid him."</p>
    <p>Raft's lips tightened. "But if he succeeds, he'll try to waken the Flame?"</p>
    <p>"He will, and there is the peril," Janissa said. "The First Race supposedly learned how to control Curupuri, but their experiment was never performed. How do we know they found the answer?"</p>
    <p>"We don't."</p>
    <p>Janissa moved uneasily.</p>
    <p>"It may mean destruction. The Flame unchecked, raging through Paititi. Many of us think as the First Race did, that we can live our lives safely, and let our children make the test. But the Flame sinks fast. The waters run more swiftly than the old days. We do not know when the danger-level will be reached. And--and the king has not yet decided."</p>
    <p>"Which side does he favor?"</p>
    <p>"Who knows?" she asked, shrugging. "We cannot read Dar-um's mind. Many in Paititi want freedom to live as they always have. They are willing to procrastinate rather than risk extinction. But there are others who think differently.</p>
    <p>"I, for one, do not know, Brian. I know only this: I have my trust. I am of royal blood, and must guard the Flame. Against Parror if need be! When the king decides, I'll obey him. Meanwhile, Craddock has the answer locked in his brain. An answer that may mean death or life."</p>
    <p>Raft stared toward the open window and the cloudy veil that hung above the great deep beyond. His voice was low.</p>
    <p>"There's one thing, Janissa. I'm in this game now. I don't know quite where I'll fit, but I'm not just a spectator any more." His eyes hardened. "I don't like being pushed around. Darum--Parror--even you--have been treating Craddock and me like chessmen. And there wasn't much we could do about it, because we didn't know the answers."</p>
    <p>She watched him unblinkingly. He went on.</p>
    <p>"We were dragged into this. What we want most is to get out, back to our own world. If you'll help us, we'll help you. So let me tell you this straight. You don't mind if Parror gets the secret of controlling the Rame, but you don't want him to use it. Not without the king's permission. Right?"</p>
    <p>"That's correct."</p>
    <p>"Fine. Then it's simply a matter of convincing Darum that I'm Brian Raft. He had me captured because he thought I was Craddock."</p>
    <p>Her green eyes flashed. "Darum has left the castle, with a band of soldiers. I've learned that."</p>
    <p>"Then he believed me! He went to get Craddock himself." Raft hesitated. No, he realized, the king had not taken his word for the substitution. Instead, Darum was investigating the possibility, cutting the Gordian knot of uncertainty by going directly to the source--Parror.</p>
    <p>"Parror is resourceful," Janissa said. "I don't know..." She shook her head, the soft curls stirring with her movement.</p>
    <p>"Well, what am I supposed to do? Sit here waiting till Darum gets back?"</p>
    <p>The girl pondered.</p>
    <p>"Let me use the mirror again," she said at last. She took out the tiny lens, bending her head to stare intently into those cloudy depths. Raft saw her start,</p>
    <p>"What's wrong?"</p>
    <p>"Wait." She held up a warning hand. "It is difficult to get through. There's a barrier..."</p>
    <p>She straightened, thrusting the mirror back into her dress.</p>
    <p>"Craddock is tranced," she said. "Not the spell of the mirror, but a kind of hypnosis. Parror is taking him somewhere--I can't see where. But they have left the castle."</p>
    <p>Raft bit at his lower lip. "Can't you communicate with Craddock at all?"</p>
    <p>"I can catch only a few stray thoughts. Not much."</p>
    <p>"Can you find out where they're going? Try again, Janissa. If we could discover that, it might help."</p>
    <p>She took out the lens, bent above it in an agony of concentration. Raft saw diamonds of perspiration glittering on her forehead.</p>
    <p>"It's hard. His mind is veiled."</p>
    <p>"Try!"</p>
    <p>She let the mirror drop, amazement in her eyes. "No. Kharn--no! He'd never go there!"</p>
    <p>Raft gripped the girl's slim arms. "Kharn? Is that where the Rame is?"</p>
    <p>Janissa drew away, shivering.</p>
    <p>"Oh no. I thought he might take the unseen road, but to go to Kharn. He must have some method of protection I know nothing about. Or else it's suicide."</p>
    <p>"What is Kharn? Where is it?"</p>
    <p>"At the source of the great river," she said. "The river that flows here, under Doirada Castle. That is Kharn. But no man goes there."</p>
    <p>"Why not?"</p>
    <p>Janissa seemed to draw inward into herself.</p>
    <p>"The Garden of Kharn has life which isn't like ours. There are beings in Kharn who are--I don't know what. I've never been in the Garden. But I've been near it, though. I've felt something reaching out to touch my mind, something cold and crawling and deadly."</p>
    <p>Raft uttered a harsh laugh.</p>
    <p>"I'd be willing face any ghost if I had my rifle back."</p>
    <p>"Kharn is unhealthy," the girl said quietly. "If Parror has found a way to protect himself against the Garden, he's wiser than I thought. But I fear for Craddock."</p>
    <p>"Why? Parror will take mighty good care of Dan Craddock, till he get the information he wants. Apparently this Kharn is taboo. Which is fine for Parror. He can take his time getting the information he wants."</p>
    <p>A change had come over Janissa.</p>
    <p>"This alters things, Brian. When Darum reached Parror's castle, he'll find Parror gone. But if he knew his quarry goes to Kharn, he might intercept him, if he goes fast." She rose to her feet in a lithe, smooth motion. "Yes, this changes the face of our plans. I must get to Darum and warn him."</p>
    <p>"I'll go with you," Raft said.</p>
    <p>"No, you cannot. You couldn't leave by my path." She waved toward the window. "And there are guards outside the door."</p>
    <p>"I can take care of them."</p>
    <p>"You are not that strong. I must move fast, and alone."</p>
    <p>Raft caught her arm as she moved away. "At least tell rne how to open that door!"</p>

    <p>The elfin face smiled up at him maliciously.</p>
    <p>"Lay your hand on the brightest spot of light. But you'd better wait here for my return, Brian. A door sometimes has more than one lock."</p>
    <p>They were on the balcony now, and Janissa swung a slim leg over the railing.</p>
    <p>"You'll be back?" Raft said.</p>
    <p>"I promise."</p>
    <p>"Her mind is like the wind," Darum had said. How much could Raft trust this cat-girl of an alien species?</p>
    <p>He gripped her arms hard. He drew her toward him. That slim, strong body tensed in revolt, but Raft's mouth came down hard and covered hers.</p>
    <p>After a moment he let her go. There was a touch of mockery in his eyes now.</p>
    <p>"At least, you may not find it so easy to forget now," he said.</p>
    <p>Janissa touched her lips with questioning fingers. She stared at him.</p>
    <p>"No," she said enigmatically. "I shall not forget--that."</p>
    <p>She slipped over the balustrade and was gone, writhing to avoid the keen blades, clinging precariously to the face of the stone. Raft watched her descent till her figure vanished around a turret. Then, still undecided, he returned to his luxurious prison.</p>
    <p>He had solved nothing.</p>
    <p>He had learned a great deal, but nothing that could be of immediate use. Except--he nodded--the key to the door. That might be of very real help. Unless he wanted to sit here quietly until Janissa or the king returned.</p>
    <p>He found a heavy metal statuette, wrapped it in a silken scarf, and went to the door. He stared at the translucent panel, seeing now that glowing flecks of light moved slowly within the oval, like pallid moon-flames caught in a lazy current.</p>
    <p>The brightest spot of light.</p>
    <p>He found it and laid his palm over its glow. But nothing happened. The fleck slid from under his hand. He tried again, with no result.</p>
    <p>A door has more than one lock. That was what she had meant, then. Smiling sourly, Raft tossed his weapon away and returned to the balcony.</p>
    <p>Janissa had descended, but he could not follow her. He had no illusions on that score. Nor would any rope he might improvise reach to firm footing. He bent and tried to break off one of the swords. All he accomplished was the wounding of a finger.</p>
    <p>Raft swore softly and savagely. After that he felt a little better. He dropped on a pile of cushions and tried to plan. It was difficult. What he wanted, obviously, was to get out of Paititi and take Craddock with him. The way to do that--what was the method?</p>
    <p>He knew the road out. Once back in the Amazon jungle, he'd take his chance, even without a rifle. But escaping wouldn't solve Raft's problems now.</p>
    <p>The amulets, Parror's, and the one taken by the king. They, apparently, gave the possessor power to live outside Paititi, to slow down the metabolism to a speed normal to life beyond the valley's cliffs. But the effects were variable. Back in the hospital, Parror had once moved too fast for human eyes to observe.</p>
    <p>Suppose, then, Raft thought, he and Craddock managed to escape. They might reach the Jutahy. They might get a week's start, or a month's. But in a day pursuers from Paititi could overtake them. With the aid of the amulets, Parror or the king could flash through the jungle in pursuit, and kill or hypnotize with Janissa's trick mirror. And back he and Craddock would go to Paititi.</p>
    <p>So he was up against a dead end there.</p>
    <p>It was difficult to judge time. The sun didn't move appreciably, and the second-hand on his watch went so slowly he couldn't see its progress. He was living at an abnormally increased rate of speed here, which meant that in Paititi he was on more nearly equal terms with the cat-people. Once outside, that slight advantage would be instantly lost, as his metabolism slowed to its former rate.</p>
    <p>The psychology of a feline race--that might be the answer. ...</p>
    <p>Raft was lost in thought for a long time. He roused when the panel opened to admit not Vann, but a guard and a page, with a food-cart. After the meal he again fell into his reverie. It should be night now, but the days in this land would be as long as the nights, abnormally long.</p>
    <p>Basically the people of Paititi were feline, as he was of simian stock. Monkeys are curious. The instinct of curiosity is strong in the human race. But cats lose interest quickly. They are not builders. They had taken possession of these castles, reared long ago by the mysterious First Race, and renovated. Cats were essentially hedonists. But the factor of intelligence was a strong influence, and one whose strength Raft could not estimate.</p>
    <p>Could he base any plans on rules of logic, in a land where the human factor was so alien to his own experience? A race of cats might have unpredictable reaction....</p>
    <p>Low, urgent, warning, a wordless murmur whispered softly from across the room.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER IX.</p>
     <p>ASSASSIN'S PLOT</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>RAFT WAS ON HIS feet facing the doorway before those last echoes had died. The translucent oval was open now, the way of escape clear. But barring his path was a figure, veiled in soft grays, her face hidden, and both loveliness and horror breathed out from beneath the shrouding veils.</p>
    <p>Her hands, slim, pale, were bare, and held an instrument unfamiliar to Raft, though he had heard it before. Again the white fingers moved across intricate strings and keys. Once more the music breathed out. More urgent now, summoning him.</p>
    <p>"Yrann?" Raft said questioningly. The shrouded head bowed once. He stepped forward.</p>
    <p>"The guard?"</p>
    <p>Yrann beckoned. She turned toward that inviting portal, and Raft was at her heels, but warily. The corridor outside held no menance.</p>
    <p>The guard was standing motionless. He did not turn his head. By the door, he stood frozen, his eyes wide, staring at a milky, glittering little sphere on the floor at his feet.</p>
    <p>Raft's eyes were drawn to that globe. Colors were moving and coiling slowly beneath its surface. It was growing larger....</p>
    <p>The soft, urgent strings roused him. Yrann moved forward, bending to lift the sphere and hide it in her veils. The spell snapped. But the guard, Raft saw, still was motionless.</p>
    <p>He pointed to the man and raised his brows questioningly. The music sounded reassuring, somehow.</p>
    <p>"The guard will not wake. Not for a while. The spell holds him."</p>
    <p>Raft noticed that the oval door had closed behind him. Yrann was beckoning again. Which meant exactly what? Treachery? Perhaps. The cat people were unpredictable. But, at least, it was better than sitting in his prison waiting, and Raft felt quite able to protect himself against a woman.</p>
    <p>He followed her along the corridor.</p>
    <p>She took a circuitous route, Raft thought. They met no one, with the exception of a page who came hurrying toward them from the distance. Instantly Yrann pressed Raft aside, into a shelter behind a velvet tapestry. The page passed unsuspiciously, bowing to Yrann as he went. Then, after a moment, the journey was resumed.</p>
    <p>It ended before another hanging that Yrann thrust aside, urging Raft through and letting the drape fall again. Now that familiar dim light--or, rather, absence of it--made Raft close his eyes briefly. There was utter silence.</p>
    <p>Through the stillness Yrann's music sang. Her fingers dwelt on his arm.</p>
    <p>She guided him forward, making no misstep even in this vague gloom. Swiftly they approached the silk-heaped dais where the king had sat.</p>
    <p>The shrouded form beside him began sending out emanations which were curiously ominous.</p>
    <p>"What is it, Yrann?" Raft said. "What do you want?"</p>
    <p>The oboe murmured, the strings twanged, and there was something evil in the minor notes that sounded.</p>
    <p>The music held malignance.</p>
    <p>Yrann touched the cushions of the dais reflectively. Her hand lingered on the softness where Darum's body had lain. Then again that cool, wordless song whispered evilly, with a conspiratoral secrecy about it. It was heavy with suggestion.</p>
    <p>Yrann turned toward the back of the dais. Curtains hung there. She held one aside, beckoning till Raft came to her side. Gently she guided him to a little alcove in the wall.</p>
    <p>She pressed something into his hand. And stepped back, letting the curtain drop.</p>
    <p>Wait, the music said. Wait now.</p>
    <p>He was in utter darkness. But he knew what it was that he held. His free hand investigated cautiously. And recoiled from vicious, razor-sharp metal.</p>
    <p>He pulled at the curtain. Yrann's harp-oboe shrilled sharp warning. The velvet fell back.</p>
    <p>Then soft footsteps fading into stillness. A rustle. He sensed that Yrann had gone.</p>
    <p>But he knew unmistakably now why she had brought him here.</p>
    <p>Working his lips as though he tasted something unpleasant, Raft leaned back against the wall. Yrann had helped him, if only for her own purposes. Now the idea was to get out of the castle, somehow.</p>
    <p>On the curtain before him a ghostly, pale movement was visible. His eyes had adjusted now, and he could make out a shadow, man-shaped, cast on the fabric--the shadow of a man whose hand held a long-bladed dagger.</p>
    <p>His own shadow. He turned. Behind him was no wall, but one of the familiar oval doors. But its glow was dimmed, and the crawling flecks of light were very faint.</p>
    <p>He located the brightest one and laid his hand upon it.</p>
    <p>The oval panel lifted and was gone. Instantly a blaze of light dazzled him.</p>
    <p>His weapon ready, Raft waited, blinking. But there was nothing alive in the room before him. Only a fantastic glitter of brightness and shining metals, a richness of flamboyant color that contrasted strangely with the gloom of the chamber behind him.</p>
    <p>Struck by a new thought, he stepped back, through the curtain, and swung it into place. The material was opaque. No hint of light filtered through. If Yrann, or anyone else, entered, his hiding-place would not be betrayed by an oval glow on the dark hanging.</p>
    <p>Satisfied on that scorn, Raft again entered what he saw to be Darum's treasure-vault.</p>
    <p>If he expected a hoard of gold and diamonds, he was disappointed. There were diamonds, highly polished and many-faceted, but they seemed to hold equal place with quartz crystals that were used for the same purpose of jewelry and decoration. There was metal here, curious alloys in which hints of rainbow colors rippled, like oil on water. And weapons, many weapons.</p>
    <p>The blades were of good quality, which was to be expected, for manganese, beryllium, and chromium were found in Brazil. There must be deposits of the elements here in Paititi. Certainly there was silver, for delicately shaped and engraved vases of it, burnished and shining, were set in a row around the walls.</p>
    <p>It was the loot of a strangely alien civilization. Some of the objects the cat people found beautiful were ugly to Raft's eyes. One set of very plain, sleek metals reminded him of Brancusis. His gaze followed arcs and curves that were curiously satisfying and oddly suggestive, though he realized he could probably never completely understand the principles that underlay the art-forms of this race.</p>
    <p>There were more utilitarian objects. Many of them were dueling-gloves, with their razor-keen triple talons curving out viciously from the fingers. Raft picked up one of these, jeweled and ornate, and drew it on his hand. The claws ran the full length of his fingers, he found, and instinctively his hand tensed and curved.</p>
    <p>Encrusted as it was with gems, the glove could be used as a handy substitute for brass knuckles. Which would probably shock the cat people, Raft thought sardonically, as he slipped the gauntlet into a capacious pocket he had discovered in his garments.</p>
    <p>There were a number of maps, engraved in metal, and jewel-framed, too heavy to be portable, but interesting. One seemed to show Paititi. Raft could make nothing of the symbols, but he located Parror's castle, and the great gulf into which the torrent poured.</p>
    <p>Thoughtfully he traced the river back to its source, where a tiny ring of zircons surrounded a few cryptic markings. The Garden of Kharn, eh? Where Parror was heading, with his captive Craddock.</p>
    <p>Another map showed the castle itself, and was made with a dozen thin metal sheets that lifted on hinges. Raft studied this closely. What he wanted was a way out. Unfortunately, he found orientation difficult, until he managed to identify his own prison apartment. After that, it was easier.</p>
    <p>Finally he drew back, nodding. Yes, he thought he could find his way now.</p>
    <p>Yrann's music came urgently to his ears.</p>
    <p>Raft whirled toward the door. Nothing. But the song kept on, warning, shrill.</p>
    <p>He moved forward. The shape of a familiar object on a shelf caught his glance.</p>
    <p>It was a revolver, a small, ornate weapon of mother-of-pearl and silver filigree. Beside it lay a heap of cartridges. Raft swept the cartridges into his pocket and lifted the gun, staring at the initials on the butt. TDF--Thomaz da Fonseca, the aviator who had crashed in Paititi. His revolver, then.</p>
    <p>It was not Raft's own heavy, powerful Colt, but it was far better than a dagger. He slipped his finger through the guard, saw that it was unloaded, and deftly thrust shells into the chamber. Then he stepped across the threshold and waited, his hand on the curtain before him.</p>
    <p>Yrann's music had changed. It was softer now, welcoming. But under it ran a counterpoint of menace, a soft susurrus of treachery and evil.</p>
    <p>"Parror had escaped me, Yrann," the king's low voice said. "There was another man from outside in his castle, I found traces. But they are gone. We could find no tracks."</p>
    <p>The wordless song was questioning.</p>
    <p>"They are still in Paititi. I had guards at the gate to the unseen road. Parror will not get at the Flame till I am willing. Nevertheless, I do not know where he is, now."</p>
    <p>Tenderness breathed across the strings--and hidden hatred.</p>
    <p>Darum sighed.</p>
    <p>"I was ready. I was ready for anything I might find. I even thought Parror might take the unseen road to outside, and I was ready to pursue him even there. But how can I find him when he has vanished with this other man?"</p>
    <p>Raft rubbed his jaw reflectively. He knew where Parror had gone. If he told the king, would that help?</p>
    <p>Yrann played lightly, and now slumber breathed out from the hollow crying of the pipes.</p>
    <p>"Yes," the king said. "Yes, there is always this, Yrann. The world does not come intoour chamber here." He sighed. "There is nothing here but our love."</p>
    <p>Sleep, the music said. Sleep, my lover and my king. Only sleep--and wake no more.</p>
    <p>But Darum sensed no menace. His breathing grew quieter. Drowsiness crept through the curtain, taking Raft in a warm embrace. Yrann's music was magic.</p>
    <p>Dark magic, Raft thought angrily. He shook his head savagely.</p>
    <p>After a time Yrann's arm crept through the soft barrier, touching Raft, pulling him forward. The glare of light from behind him struck full on Yrann's face--or what should have been a face. With a wordless sound she pulled her veil in place. Raft felt her gaze go from him to the treasure chamber. But the harp was silent. It asked no question.</p>
    <p>The curtain remained looped back, and the light struck out to the dais, where Darum lay asleep, his face relaxed and peaceful. He stirred uneasily. Yrann's fingers rippled across the strings, and the king was silent once more.</p>
    <p>Yrann touched the little revolver hesitantly. Then she pulled the dagger from Raft's bent, where he had placed it, and thrust it into his hand. She pushed him forward, pointing to the dais.</p>
    <p>Raft halted. The veiled face was lifted to his. He shook his head slowly and emphatically.</p>
    <p>"No," he said under his breath. "Even if that would save my life, I don't think I could do it."</p>
    <p>Yrann's hand poised over the harp-strings, somehow threateningly. The tableau held for a moment. Then she must have seen that he meant what he said. She made a dreadful snarling sound deep in her throat and snatched the dagger from Raft's grip, whirling toward the sleeping king. Her draperies swirled as she bent and plucked at Darum's shirt, tearing the thin silk open. Darum murmured and stirred in his music-drugged sleep. Yrann swung the dagger high, poised it.</p>
    <p>Raft's reaction was instinctive. He had begun his leap forward before he saw what gleamed upon the king's bared chest, something square and shining, on a silver chain. Something that seemed to give out light that quivered like the pulse of life itself.</p>
    <p>The amulet!</p>
    <p>There was no time to examine it. There was no time to ask questions and be sure.</p>
    <p>But Raft had an inner certainty which needed no confirmation. A man could not look upon that shaking gleam and not recognize it.</p>
    <p>With one hand Raft snatched at the amulet. The chain snapped under his violent pull. With the other he seized Yrann's as her knife began to plunge downward. She snarled again and bent like a bow against him, fighting hard for the weapon.</p>
    <p>They swayed together beside the couch, battling in desperate silence. The harp crashed to the floor. A string broke with a ringing snap. On the couch Darum sat up dizzily, peering at the dimly seen figures reeling before him.</p>
    <p>Then with a suddenness that made Raft stagger, Yrann released the knife. She sprang back, stooping to snatch up the harp. Her fingers swept across it, dragging a wild discord of alarm from the strings.</p>
    <p>Waken! Beware!</p>
    <p>Loud with ringing urgency, the music crashed against the walls. The king struggled up, shaking his head, crying out confused questions. But he was caught in the shaft of light from the treasure room, and could see Raft as no more than a shadow--a shadow, and a glint of threatening steel.</p>
    <p>The music screamed and wailed. There was a distant sound of running feet.</p>
    <p>Cursing under his breath, Raft whirled and raced for the door by which he had entered, praying that it was open. He swept the drapery aside, saw an open passage before him, and plunged into it. Now he was tagged as an assassin. That meant he had to escape, and fast. The king might listen to explanations, but the probability was that he wouldn't, especially since they involved Yrann.</p>
    <p>The map he had seen burned in Raft's mind. If he got off the track once, he knew he was lost. There should be another branching corridor here, at about this point.</p>
    <p>He dodged into it, but did not slacken his pace. The sound of distant, aroused voices gave him warning. He gripped the revolver tighter. It would be more useful than the dagger. As for Yrann, he knew now what she had intended. If necessary, she would have killed Darum herself, and put the blame on Raft. Which was thoroughly human as well as feline.</p>
    <p>Twice he hid behind curtains while guards raced past. Once he stopped, not breathing, before an oval door, wondering what lay beyond. It led to escape, he knew, but there might be soldiers behind it.</p>
    <p>There were. Shadows showed against the panel. Raft turned silently and raced back, knowing he was lost now. Unless another way opened up before him, which wasn't likely.</p>
    <p>He turned into another passage, where windows stood open in one wall. Glancing out, he found himself staring, not into the Gulf of Doirada, but at the river, where it curved in and finally poured over the edge of an arched opening, beneath the castle.</p>
    <p>Beyond the mossy plain loomed the enormous pillars of the forest, sanctuary if he could reach it. But the river lay far below, and was flowing too fast. It would sweep him into the abyss, if its rush gripped him.</p>
    <p>Too fast?</p>
    <p>Not in Paititi, where the metabolism of all living things was speeded up so enormously. For all its power, the waters below glided past so smoothly, so gently, he might have been watching the gentle boiling of a cloud-river.</p>
    <p>Raft thrust the revolver into his pocket, closing over it a fastening. The contrivance sealed it tightly, which indicated the pocket might be waterproof. That would help. Raft gave a quick glance to left and right. He saw no one, though the sounds of pursuit were louder.</p>
    <p>Then he climbed into the window-frame, two hundred feet above that molten silver cataract--and dived.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER X.</p>
     <p>NIGHTMARE GARDEN</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>ONE THING RAFT had forgotten, and the fantastic thing was that he had time to remember it as he fell. The rate of speed of a freely falling body does not vary. Friction of air has some effect, but very little when an object weighing a hundred and sixty pounds, in the form of a man, drops free.</p>
    <p>Raft's metabolism had been tremendously accelerated by the radiation that pervaded Paititi. He was living far faster than in his own world. And he had seen immense boulders float down lightly as feathers from the towering cliffs.</p>
    <p>To his own mind, he did not fall. He dropped gently as in an elevator, utterly stunned with surprise, so astonished was he that the truth did not strike him immediately. When it did, there was nothing he could do about it.</p>
    <p>Gently he revolved as he drifted down. Beside him the wall of the castle slipped past. At any moment Someone might come out on a balcony and see him. A thrown spear would be dangerous. It could be thrown sufficiently fast to impale him, since the wielder could easily gauge the rate of Raft's fall.</p>
    <p>He had never felt so helpless and naked in his life. It was like hanging free and unsupported in interplanetary space. He had time for a hundred questions and fears to pass through his mind before, finally, with agonizing slowness, his body struck the waters of the torrent.</p>
    <p>His mass was the same, and he sank, angling slowly in the direction of the current. But he was breathing perhaps a hundred times faster than normal, so there was a new danger. Under ordinary conditions he could have held his breath until he reached the surface. As it was he might not emerge above the water for five minutes!</p>
    <p>Now the accelerated metabolism was helpful. Raft managed to turn and swim up, though it was like moving in glue, against that slow, inexorable thrust of driving waters. He was a fly drowning in syrup. But the fly reached the surface at last.</p>
    <p>Under ordinary conditions he would have been swept over the brink into Doirada Gulf, but his stimulated time-sense fought the slow pressure of the water. He fought his way upstream. He dragged himself to a shallow pool and collapsed, gasping.</p>
    <p>There was no time to rest yet, though. He was not yet out of range of pursuit. Nor did he think he could cross the clearing to where the forest began without being spotted.</p>
    <p>Wildly he stared about him, searching for a hiding place.</p>
    <p>Reeds grew thickly about the margin of the pool. The water itself was roiled with thick mud, and opaque. Raft found a hollow reed, tested it, and made use of an old trick. He simply lay down in the water, anchoring himself by gripping embedded rocks, and breathed through the improvised lifeline.</p>
    <p>He could not see, but he could not be seen, either. The cat people might discover his hiding-place, of course. Yet the chance was worth taking, Raft thought, remembering the difference between feline and simian psychology.</p>
    <p>The pursuers would expect him--as a descendant of simians--to depend on flight, and probably to head for the forest. They would themselves be too fastidious to hide in dirty water if any other way of escape opened, and automatically might expect Raft to think in the same manner. If so, they would be mistaken.</p>
    <p>His eyes shut, Raft concentrated on breathing. It was not too easy.</p>
    <p>The amulet--could that help him now? It contained a spark from the Flame, from the tremendous energy-source called Curupuri. And it had the property of lowering the metabolic rate, somehow.</p>
    <p>If, instead, it accelerated metabolism, Raft would have been more satisfied. It might actually do that, but that seemed improbable.</p>
    <p>The sparks, probably, were keyed to the original Flame, kept powered by induction, unless they were each complete in themselves, like a speck of radium. To decelerate would mean that Raft would become the equivalent of a living statue among enemies moving like flashes of lightning.</p>
    <p>Anyhow, the amulet was in his sealed pocket, and could not be secured without ruining da Fonseca's revolver. It was something to be investigated later. There was nothing to do now but play possum, and wait.</p>
    <p>So Raft waited, while the chill of the river crept stealthily into his flesh, numbing nerves and muscles. He forced himself to wait, unhitching his mind till he seemed to float in a vacuum where neither light nor sound existed, nothing save the slow, jellied motion of the current in the pool. He couldn't afford to wait for nightfall. It might be several weeks, to his time-sense, before the sun dropped out of sight.</p>
    <p>There were, Raft thought wryly, certain handicaps to a land where metabolism had gone so fantastically haywire.</p>
    <p>Anyway, Darum had not caught Parror. That arrogant individual had taken Craddock, to Kharn, which lay at the source of this very river. What lay in the Garden of Kharn, Raft hadn't the slightest idea. Janissa had feared it. And she wasn't easily frightened, Raft surmised. His thoughts drifted toward the girl, with her strange, dark-circled eyes and her tiger-striped hair.</p>
    <p>For no apparent reason, he thought of Balzac, and the French writer's story, "A Passion in the Desert." Then he had the connection: a man's love for a--had it been a lioness? Or a leopard. Not a jaguar, anyway. There were no jaguars in the Sahara.</p>
    <p>Janissa?</p>
    <p>Feline she was, but she was human too. Though child of an alien species, she was no beast, no stalking beast of prey.</p>
    <p>Raft caught himself.</p>
    <p>"Good grief!" he thought. "Am I imagining I'm in love with the girl? I've seen her just twice, in the flesh. It's novelty. I'm attracted by her exotic strangeness. When I get out of here, in five years or so, maybe, I'll meet a girl from Peoria and marry her." The very term marriage made him realize the fantasy of the situation. He grinned inwardly.</p>
    <p>"Biologically I rather imagine it's impossible. Besides, such things don't happen. I certainly wouldn't want my wife going out at night to sit on the back fence and howl."</p>
    <p>Nevertheless the thought did not entirely leave him. The union of two races, two species, rather, had never occurred in the history of biology. He broke the problem down into basic equations of genes and chromosomes, and that passed time, but finally made him feel foolish. Eventually he was glad to raise his head warily above water and prepare to emerge.</p>
    <p>A long time had passed, and the alarm must long since have died down. No one was visible on any of the castle's many balconies, nor could the courtyard be seen from here. But if Raft attempted to cross that open plain, he would inevitably be spotted.</p>
    <p>He could keep to the river--though its slow, powerful current was a danger. So he set off upstream, hugging as closely to the bank as he could, crawling mostly, swimming at times, and keeping the reed always ready. Once, at a suspicious flash of movement, he lay hidden, but he was overly cautious then. By the time he reached the forest, he was freezing cold and bleeding from scraped elbows and wrists.</p>
    <p>He hoped the cat people did not trail by scent. It was unlikely. They were a civilized race, and the dulling of certain</p>
    <p>senses is the price evolution exacts. The lower species, depending on scent and sound, have those faculties highly developed. On the other hand, man's vision is far more powerful and more easily adjustable than the vision of most beasts.</p>
    <p>Darum would not know his destination. The closer he got to Kharn, the safer he would be from pursuit.</p>
    <p>A cyclopean tree shut out the turrets of the castle. Raft went on cautiously for perhaps half a mile. Then he opened the sealed pocket, made sure his revolver was dry, and put the dagger into his belt. The amulet he took out for a closer inspection.</p>
    <p>It told him nothing. A spark of fire glittered in the depths of a cloudy crystal chip that was in turn set in a thick metallic lozenge, square with rounded corners. The flat gem could, he found on experiment, be revolved like the dial of a safe. He turned it cautiously.</p>
    <p>There was no change, except, perhaps, for a freshening of the breeze. How could he test the device?</p>
    <p>His watch, of course.</p>
    <p>Luckily the watch was waterproof. He stared at the dial, noticing that the second hand was moving very slowly. He turned the crystal on the amulet again and the pointer moved faster. Another turn, and it raced.</p>
    <p>Which meant that his metabolism was correspondingly slower.</p>
    <p>Would the amulet also increase the rate of life? If so, that would solve many problems. He could get to Kharn, perhaps, even before Parror arrived there. But he was doomed to disappointment on that score. The amulet could retard metabolism, but it could not increase it beyond the rate prevalent in Paititi.</p>
    <p>That meant the spark, undoubtedly, was attuned to the Flame itself, radiating at the same energy-rate and moving in the same cycle. Well, Raft didn't want to be handicapped by moving more slowly than the rest of his temporary world, and he adjusted the device till it was as he had found it.</p>
    <p>He now put it in the pocket that held the revolver, and went on. He was estimating, as well as he could remember, the velocity of a bullet, and wondering if, under the current conditions, any target he fired at might be able to dodge lead.</p>
    <p>He must remember to use the gun at close range, the closer the better!</p>
    <p>The use of artillery would be handicapped in Paititi. If a bomb were dropped on Doirada Castle, the cat people would almost have time to dismantle the structure and move it elsewhere before the egg landed. No wonder the species fought with steel, instead of propellents. Only an energy-ray could be truly efficient here.</p>
    <p>Which explained, Raft decided, why mental powers were so highly developed--Janissa's mirror, Yrann's hypnotic sphere. Timelag would be minimized with such devices.</p>
    <p>The whole inanimate part of the valley was indeed under a spell, such a one as had protected the Norse god Baldur. There could be few fatalities through accident. Not when stones floated, rivers ran like treacle, and a man fell as slowly as Alice descending the rabbit-hole!</p>
    <p>As he went on, he paid more attention to the life around him, the curious creatures that used the gigantic trees as hiding places. In the cool, clear light he could make out new details.</p>
    <p>The flower-bright vines, with their dangerous tentacles, slithered swiftly across the bark. There were many of the three-foot alligators, lurking hi the pools they themselves seemed to have constructed on the trunks, shells that resembled the cups rubber-workers fasten to the hevea bark as they drain their milky latex.</p>
    <p>The 'gators had surprisingly flexible claws. Raft noticed a couple of them constructing their pools, scraping resinous wood from the tree and making it into a kind of cement with a fluid they secreted from salivary glands.</p>
    <p>Only the sloths were truly familiar, and they were all the stranger because of the rapidity with which they moved. The true sloth hangs motionless by its claws, as its tongue flashes out to reap a nutritious harvest of insects. Its metabolism is abnormally slow.</p>
    <p>But it was not slow here.</p>
    <p>As for the inch-long parasites that crept through the sloths' hair, Raft found those creatures too unpleasantly familiar to be truly interesting. Only their ape-like tails kept them from resembling too closely the species that was not dominant in Paititi, though it might be elsewhere.</p>
    <p>Most intriguing were the brown furry mammals in the apartment-house nests. They had sucking-disks on their paws, which were none too efficient, but their elongated snouts ended in tabs of flesh like the extremity of an elephant's trunk, a finger and thumb, which they used as man might use his hands. Its prehensile delicacy was amazing.</p>
    <p>Raft wondered what the interior of the nests was like. He felt that what lay inside might be surprising.</p>
    <p>Underfoot was only the moss. There was no underbrush. Those incredible trees seemed to have sucked all the nutriment out of the ground, leaving so little that only moss could flourish. That gave a logical explanation for the tree-parasites.</p>
    <p>Where else could they live, except in a closely integrated society, where hunger made an automatic check-and-balance? Even the trees were part of that inexorable system, for they had drained the earth of life. And in return, they were hosts to other species.</p>
    <p>Species had reached dead end in this land. They would never evolve to dominance, as the cat people had evolved, Raft surmised. They had found their balance.</p>
    <p>And, meanwhile, he had to find Craddock.</p>
    <p>Keeping a wary eye out for possible pursuit, he followed the river. Never at any time could he see more than a half-mile ahead. The trees made a maze. But the river itself was a guide. Raft plunged on doggedly, until at last exhaustion forced him to rest.</p>
    <p>There might be shelter on one of the encrusted tree-trunks, but life was too teeming there. None of the things seemed to venture to the ground, however, and Raft finally lay down on the river bank, in lieu of better shelter. He might be attacked while he slept, but there was no way of guarding against that. He laid the revolver ready and slept, hoping for the best.</p>
    <p>When he awoke, he went on again. Nor had he far to travel now. An hour's walk, as he estimated time, brought him to a wall which blocked further progress. It was only twenty feet high, dwarfed by the trees, but it was of some age-resistant plastic or alloy, and had eroded scarcely at all.</p>
    <p>To left and to right it stretched away and was lost amid the trees. But it was broken at one spot by an archway, through which the river poured. Sediment had built up a narrow ledge bordering the water, a precarious path that led beneath the arch.</p>
    <p>Unhesitatingly Raft stepped out on that muddy trail. He could see faint outlines that might have been footprints, and, further along, his suspicion was confirmed when he observed a track that was unmistakably that of Craddock's heavy boots. He was very nearly at the end of the trail.</p>
    <p>Ahead he could make out irregular vegetation darkening that hemispherical opening, blocking his vision. He went on, more carefully now. There were bushes, he noted with surprise.</p>
    <p>He began to push through their tangled mass, and abruptly drew back, contact with the things startling him. Their texture had been unlike the rough, bristly texture of plants. They were warm.</p>
    <p>They were not plants.</p>
    <p>Lacy filigrees, arabesque nets of interwoven mesh, made a curtain on each side of the river. They were grayish-pink, reminding Raft unmistakably of the neutral structure of a living body, networks of nerves, raw and unpleasant. Nor were they rooted like plants.</p>
    <p>They quivered, vibrated. They drew back to let him pass.</p>
    <p>As he stepped forward, they drew into themselves like contracting anemones touched by an intrusive finger. A dozen grayish, irregular little balls hugged the ground, blending with it in protective camouflage.</p>
    <p>Beyond them lay the Garden of Kharn, a sickly, yellowish tangle of vegetation blocking Raft's view. He could see the guarding wall marching to left and right, curving in to form what must be an enclosure. There were none of the giant trees within the wall, though their columns loomed above and beyond it.</p>
    <p>Raft moved on, keeping to the river bank. The bushes were strange to him, though he was no botanist. They seemed a rather impossible hybrid of fungus and true plant. They were fern and mushroom in one.</p>
    <p>Oddly he thought of them as vampires, draining life from the very ground.</p>
    <p>That forest was not normal--no. The cyclopean trees outside were friendly by comparison. They, at least, were as immense and aloof as gods.</p>
    <p>But these plants, these sickly hybrids, grew with a rank luxuriance that was in itself unhealthy. Movement crawled through the yellow jungle, not the wave-motion of wind, but secretive, stealthy movements which made Raft's scalp prickle.</p>
    <p>Very faintly, scarcely noticeable, he felt a presence in the Garden. And he knew, then, why Janissa had not wanted to speak of Kharn.</p>
    <p>For that intangibly sensed presence was not malignant. It was worse. It was cold and distant and alien.</p>
    <p>And, intrinsically, it was very evil.</p>
    <p>Raft moved even more cautiously now. There was menace here, the more ominous because he could not define it. It was a brooding, enigmatic presence which was sensed by the cat-people as well as by himself. This added up to significance.</p>
    <p>Felines and simians react in different ways to the same stimulus. Cats are notorious for their acceptance of the supernatural, which meant simply the supernormal, vibrations and radiations too subtle to be sensed fully by mankind. Psychic menaces that would give a man cold chills would rouse a cat to purring ecstasy.</p>
    <p>Similarly, cats react violently to a canine menace--a wolf--whereas a man simply reaches for the nearest weapon.</p>
    <p>This malignancy, therefore, was a presence alien to both feline and simian.</p>
    <p>Perhaps, it was alien chiefly because of the altered evolutionary standard in this hothouse valley of forced growth. There was an old sort of familiarity about that unseen presence. Raft felt certain that he had encountered something of the sort before, and often. Yet never had his living flesh shrunk from the mere nearness of any creature as it did now. Whatever dwelt in the Garden of Kharn, it was nothing remotely normal or healthy.</p>
    <p>He stepped beneath the broad leaves and mushroom-caps of the forest. A sulphurous yellow light filtered through from above, lacking in the cool clarity of the atmosphere outside the Garden.</p>
    <p>The ground underfoot was spongy, a moist, slippery muck into which his sandals sank mushily, with an unpleasant sucking sound. It was not silent here. There were furtive, quick movements all about him, hidden in that yellow jungle.</p>
    <p>He was an intruder and felt it. A fleshy stem bent slowly toward him, sticky juice exuding from its surface. The sweetish odor of the liquor was sickening. Raft stepped away, and the branch rose slowly toward the perpendicular, as though it was dragging itself painfully upright against the fetters of gravity.</p>
    <p>Yes, the forest was conscious of him. But there were no cannibal trees here, no gigantic Venus fly-traps that could swallow him whole. There was something horrible about the straining, awkward motion of those heavy leaves and stems.</p>
    <p>The place was alive with insects. The forest crawled with them, flies, moths, butterflies, a myriad varieties crept and buzzed and fed on the ichor the trees sweated.</p>
    <p>Some of the fungi had hollow caps like huge bowls, and the stench that rose from those liquid-filled basins was overpowering. Yet it was not entirely unpleasant.</p>
    <p>Attar of roses is sickening in quantity, but the merest suggestion of attar has the opposite effect. Had the forest not sweated their perfume till the very air was saturated with it, Raft might not have objected. As it was, his clothes were moist and stinking with the stuff before he had traveled more than a few yards.</p>
    <p>The trail of Parror and Craddock was well marked. There were other tracks in the soil, ambiguous prints Raft did not recognize. But he ignored these to follow his quarry. Parror had headed directly toward the center of the Garden.</p>
    <p>One of the pink webwork creatures crept slowly into view. A filament of raw nerves, it crawled up the stem of a fungus and pulled itself into the liquid-filled cap. It immersed itself, floating motionless, its tendrils spreading out like the hair of a drowned woman.</p>
    <p>A little creature, plated like an armadillo, rolled into view. Raft watched it warily. All over the armored body sharp spines struck out.</p>
    <p>It rolled toward Raft, but he avoided it easily. The spines looked dangerous. They might be toxic. Luckily the creature could not move fast.</p>
    <p>It rolled into the jungle and was gone.</p>
    <p>Raft went on. He saw another of the armored animals, but it was licking the stem of a fern-mushroom, and did not notice him. Then a clearing opened ahead, and it was--carpeted.</p>
    <p>That was Raft's first impression. Patterns of flowers, arabesque and exotic, blazed with a riot of color within a circular expanse twenty feet in diameter. But they were not flowers. A queer, smooth glaze seemed to overlie that expanse--and it was a carpet, after all. The meaningless, twisting pattern was the first touch of vivid color he had seen in the saffron forest.</p>
    <p>Raft stood scowling, sensing more strongly now that dim pulse of a living presence in the Garden.</p>
    <p>Slowly there crept into his mind the thought of a voice--whispering.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER XI.</p>
     <p>CREEPING MENACE</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>IT CAME SO slowly, so imperceptibly, that eerie voice, that Raft could not tell when it took form and shape in his brain. Yet it was not exactly a voice nor a thought. Rather, it was something akin to each, but with a difference. Communication is aimed at what psychologists call empathy--the transference of the senses from one mind to another, so that perfect understanding may be approached. It is rapport, never complete, always groping --</p>
    <p>Till now.</p>
    <p>Because the Intruder understood Raft. With its ancient wisdom it knew the very structure of his soul. Like ivy sliding through crevices in a wall, the thing permeated Raft, as though he stood bathed in a light that flowed into his body. As though he were a living sponge through which tidewater stole.</p>
    <p>The slow tide mounted.</p>
    <p>The heavy scent of the forest was not so unpleasant now. Raft could sort out the component elements which made up the perfume, the sharp, pungent fluid that the armadillo-creatures liked, the warm, oily, sweet ichor that fed the nerve-things. Other juices, musk-heavy, eucalyptus-keen, salty and sour and pungent were present. It was oddly fascinating, this business of analyzing the odors and recognizing each one.</p>
    <p>For they were, in essence, food-odors. Not human food.</p>
    <p>But nevertheless those smells stimulated the purely physical part of Raft and, through that, struck deep into his mind.</p>
    <p>Feeding was an integral part of the life-cycle, the purpose for which all things were created. Dulled senses could not appreciate the pure ecstasy of absorbing nourishment. Only specialized beings could understand the delight which went through every cell of the body.</p>
    <p>The nerve-things. They lay immersed in their warm, steaming liquor, tingling with electric pleasure as they absorbed the fluid mat was food and drink to them. The armadillo-beasts. The feeling of taste on the taste-buds of a tongue. Cool liquid slipping down a dry throat, sharp and refreshing. The pleasure of taste, and taste alone.</p>
    <p>You have always known hunger, Brian Raft.</p>
    <p>He was standing in the center of that patterned carpet, he noticed. It did not matter. He was trying to concentrate on that message, that inviting whisper which spoke to him of delights so purely physical that they transcended anything else.</p>
    <p>Not only animal-beings, but plants as well, knew hunger and satiation. For plants fed through their root-sytems, set deep into the breathing earth that is the primal source of all life. Something utterly unimaginable crawled through Raft, the physical sensation of having roots, of feeling himself absorb nourishment through vegetable tissue. Plant-cells. He was part of the earth itself, and it fed him.</p>
    <p>He sank to his knees on that smooth, vivid carpet.</p>
    <p>Now he was looking up at a shimmering dance of faint light. He was on his back, arms flung wide, and a tingling, delightful warmth was saturating him. He was on quicksand which very slowly, very gently, settled beneath him.</p>
    <p>Or it was not settling. It was he who was dissolving, being absorbed into that alien substance on which he lay. He was becoming part of the composite, hungry life that beat distantly all around him, murmuring in the slow motions of the trees, shuddering through the very earth.</p>
    <p>You have always known hunger, Brian Raft. You are one. I am many.</p>
    <p>Therefore feed and be content, the silent voice said. Sip the sharp, tingling essence that nourishes the armored beasts. Steep yourself in the warm smoothness of the liquor in the fungus-cups. Thrust roots into the soil, and know the subtle delight of a feeding which permeates all of you, body and mind.</p>
    <p>Brighter grew the swirling mists. They blotted out vision. But there was no need for eyes. The trees were blind, yet they thrilled with ecstasy as their roots sucked up food.</p>
    <p>The trees?</p>
    <p>No, they could not feel. And yet they could. Something bound them to all other life here, by an unbreakable cord.</p>
    <p>The Garden of Kharn hungered and was fed.</p>
    <p>Memories flashed through Raft's mind. The Intruder was questioning, seeking, probing for what? He remembered the sharp catnip taste of beer, the peppery spiciness of curry, the fresh hot taste of newly-baked bread. The sweet juice of tangerines was in his mouth, and the heavy richness of cocoa. The aromatic tickling of old brandy.</p>
    <p>Eagerness touched Raft. The probing grew more violent. He half roused himself from his trance.</p>
    <p>Still the memories were dragged into the forefront of his consciousness. The tastes of things he had known once, elsewhere.</p>
    <p>Where, then?</p>
    <p>In a world where brandy was sipped from sleek glass inhalers, where bread was baked in ovens, where cocoa was served in cups, on tables upon which white linen was spread. Association clicked in Raft's brain. He remembered more than food now.</p>
    <p>He remembered civilization. And with that thought came realization of himself, of Brian Raft. He was not a sensuous machine for sucking up nourishment.</p>
    <p>The bright mists swept down like a shrouding blanket. The Garden of Kham sent its heavy perfume like a tide over Raft. But he remembered, very suddenly and chillingly, another Garden, and a Tree which had borne strange fruit A command that said, "Ye shall not eat of it."</p>
    <p>You have always known hunger, Brian Raft. Feed as I feed. Know ecstasy as I know it.</p>
    <p>A still, cool, distant voice, infinitely alluring, impossible to resist, although it, too, aroused memory. That indefinable familiarity was stronger now. The presence that infiltrated the Garden was one that Raft had known before, in different form.</p>
    <p>Then he remembered.</p>
    <p>And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die.</p>
    <p>The blind shock of realization stabbed through Raft with abysmal violence. His muscles jerked into tenseness. He attempted to spring up, and found that he could not.</p>
    <p>That gelid carpet had flowed upon him, over him, as he had lain motionless.</p>
    <p>Yet it was possible to move. With infinite effort he dragged his arm down till his hand closed over the hilt of the dagger. He could feel the treacherously pleasant embrace of the thing all around him. A winding sheet that would have absorbed him, he thought, as he lay helpless.</p>
    <p>He stabbed up, claustrophobia bringing dry panic to his throat. He slashed in a blind frenzy of panic till the living carpet was ribboned. The worst part was that the entity did not try to flee. It let itself be cut to rags, till all that flowery beauty was torn and spoiled. Raft stumbled away into the dubious shelter of the saffron forest, choking for a breath of clean air. He felt filthy and contaminated.</p>
    <p>It revolted him that any one of his senses, the purely animal one of taste, could be so treacherous!</p>
    <p>What monstrous dead-end evolution had developed such a devil's Garden as this?</p>
    <p>It was more than symbiosis. It was an attunement of all life within these walls. Outside, on the cyclopean trees, various species killed each other, ate, propagated, and died. But in Kharn there had been a gradual absorption, a bond growing into existence between plant and animal life.</p>
    <p>One species--dominant!</p>
    <p>Raft presently saw that species.</p>
    <p>Deeper in the forest, the shapeless mound of flesh lay under a transparent hemisphere that seemed to be unbreakable. Raft yielded to impulse and smashed a rock down upon it, without result. He did not wish to fire his revolver, for fear of forewarning Parror, but he had an idea that a bullet would not harm that protective barrier either. Immersed in a watery liquid the gray mass floated. Small conduits like arteries led down into the ground.</p>
    <p>A brain? Only partially. Sections of it were abnormally developed, others vestigial. There were other additions which</p>
    <p>Raft could not understand. But he felt more strongly than ever the intangible evil that throbbed out from the thing.</p>
    <p>For it was reptilian. Here in Kharn the reptilian species had become dominant, subjugating all other life into a fantastic rapport that made the Garden itself a single entity. There was no really recognizable intelligence in the being. Reptilian instincts are not mammalian, and a tremendously evolved reptile might have nothing at all in common with other creatures.</p>
    <p>The thing lived only for the specialized pleasure of taste. It had developed the necessity of feeding into a sensory ecstasy that was exclusive of all other faculties. Intelligence there might be, or a sort, but it was applied only to purposes that would aid the monster's dominant instinct.</p>
    <p>Through the Garden, through living trees and and living flesh, that horrible, ravening hunger-urge had swept. Trees and flesh ate as their--brain--commanded. In return, they transmitted their sensory reactions to the reptilian thing that had gone beyond the touch of any sense but one.</p>
    <p>Impregnable, alien, living only for blind delight, the horror floated within the transparent dome.</p>
    <p>Shuddering, Raft turned away. Once more he turned to the easily-discernible trail of Parror and Craddock. The sooner he caught up with them, the sooner he could get out of the Garden. Unless they themselves had fallen victim to Kharn's menace.</p>
    <p>They had not. The white gleam of pillars showed ahead. A figure was visible there, working at something, and Raft recognized Parror's sleek hair and the velvet beard that shadowed the jaw. The Flame's guardian sensed Raft's presence instantly. He whirled, eyes narrow, and then, relaxing, laughed.</p>
    <p>The familiar anger began to rise in Raft. As always, he was conscious of Parror's calm arrogance, his complete self-assurance. He tried to fight down the feeling.</p>
    <p>"So you got away from Darum," Parror said, smiling with some secret amusement. "You're shrewder than I'd thought. How did you know where to find me?"</p>
    <p>Raft ignored the question. "Where's Craddock?" he asked.</p>
    <p>Parror's head moved slightly. Beyond a pale column lay a motionless figure, eyes closed.</p>
    <p>"There he is. Don't bother to take out your knife. He's unharmed." Parror finished winding up a thin coil. He dropped the silvery wire into a pocket and fumbled there for a moment. When his hand emerged, it wore one of the taloned gauntlets.</p>
    <p>"You touched me once in anger," Parror said silkily. "I haven't forgotten that. I've no further use for you or Craddock." He was almost purring. "I've an extra glove. Here."</p>
    <p>Raft said, "Thanks. I can take care of myself." He had an idea that might remove the careless smile from Parror's face. It would be a pleasure to do just that.</p>
    <p>He took out the jeweled glove he had stolen from Darum's treasure-chamber and slipped it on his right hand. Parror nodded.</p>
    <p>"You learn fast," he said, flexing his fingers so that the dull claws spread and closed menacingly. Raft poised himself and waited silently.</p>
    <p>Dull claws.</p>
    <p>They were bright metal where they joined the gloves, but their three-inch blades were stained dark. Raft suddenly guessed the significance of that. He had an idea that if those razor-sharp talons penetrated his skin, he would die, no matter how slight the wound.</p>
    <p>Treachery, to a feline, was not dishonorable, it seemed.</p>
    <p>Too late now to call a halt. Parror was stalking forward, his eyes shining. Moveover, Raft still had an ace in the hole. But he dared not fail.</p>
    <p>Then Parror sprang. He was laughing, his velvet motion almost careless, as he came in with the agility of a jaguar. With rippling, nimble speed he charged, swerving at the last moment, while the talons raked straight at Raft's face.</p>
    <p>Raft ducked under the slash. His hand came up, clenched into a fist. That short, deadly blow cracked solidly against Parror's chin. Raft felt flesh grind against his knuckles as hard gems ripped through skin and grated on bone.</p>
    <p>Whatever Parror had expected, it was not this. He was flung back, dazed and reeling, and for a few seconds was actually unconscious as he wavered there. Then the blinding berserk rage dropped upon him like a scarlet cloak. His lips flattened. His eyes flamed green. His face was that of a devil--or a beast.</p>
    <p>Raft had torn off his glove. He held da Fonseca's revolver now, and he was smiling coldly.</p>
    <p>"Come on," he whispered. "Come on, Parror. It's just what I want. Close quarters. So I won't be able to miss."</p>
    <p>Parror's gaze flashed to the weapon. Briefly mad fury and caution battled within him. He strained forward with tigerish blood-hunger in his contorted face.</p>
    <p>He--hissed!</p>
    <p>Raft started to walk toward his opponent. Parror snarled something that sounded like an oath. He made a furious, baffled gesture and whirled away. Raft's finger tightened on the trigger, and, on impulse, he sent a snap shot after Parror.</p>
    <p>Either he missed completely, or the bullet was too slow in this accelerated world. For the cat-man was gone in the saffron jungle. The tangled underbrush swallowed him.</p>
    <p>Raft shrugged and turned to the motionless Craddock. He worked on the man for a short tune. Respiration was slow, and the skin was moist and clammy. Shock, probably. And with good cause, Raft thought, his mouth twisting into an ugly shape.</p>
    <p>At last Craddock's eyes fluttered open. There was intelligence behind them, not the hypnotic stupor Raft had feared. He managed a crooked, weak smile.</p>
    <p>"Brian. How--how's tricks?"</p>
    <p>"Okay, for the moment," Raft said. "How do you feel?"</p>
    <p>"Nearly normal," Craddock murmured, his voice growing stronger. "It's just reaction from hypnosis, I think. It'll pass."</p>
    <p>"Don't try to get up. Just take it easy."</p>
    <p>"Where's Parror?"</p>
    <p>Raft explained. Craddock nodded slowly.</p>
    <p>"He won't be back. He got what he wanted."</p>
    <p>"You mean--what?"</p>
    <p>"Information. He had a machine, a little gadget that probed my mind. It dug up memories I didn't even know I had. That was why he brought me here. He needed time to adjust the thing to my brain. I'm of a different species, so there were difficulties. But he solved them."</p>
    <p>Raft frowned.</p>
    <p>"Too bad he's such a devil. He's smart."</p>
    <p>"He's no devil, except by human standards," Craddock said oddly. The maimed hands lifted. Craddock rubbed his eyes and shook his head as though to clear it. "A different psychology. To them, the end always justifies the means. Parrot's end is to stimulate the Flame. Curupuri."</p>
    <p>"And he can do it now?"</p>
    <p>"When he gets the equipment he needs. That'll take time."</p>
    <p>"Yeah," Raft said thoughtfully. "And Darum's got the unseen road guarded by his soldiers."</p>
    <p>"Darum?"</p>
    <p>"The king of Paititi. Listen, Dan. Do you feel strong enough to tell me what happened?"</p>
    <p>"There isn't much," Craddock said. "I was in a trance, but I could see what was going on. Parror brought me here. He had a claw-tipped glove he'd poisoned, and he fought off some creatures with it, pretty nasty specimens."</p>
    <p>"In here? In the Garden?"</p>
    <p>"The yellow forest," Craddock said doubtfully. "Yes, it was here. When we got to this place, he rigged up a barrier of some sort, with wire. I don't know what it was. But it worked. It must have. We weren't bothered after that.</p>
    <p>"Parror put his gadget on my head and kept adjusting it, dragging out all the memories I'd ever had. Eventually he got the secret of the Flame. The part I'd read, from the old records of the First Race, but that I hadn't understood."</p>
    <p>Craddock hesitated.</p>
    <p>"Funny. The symbols were stored up in my brain, though I never knew what they meant. You never really forget anything, you know, Brian. It's all there, in your subconscious, layer after layer of submerged memories that go back to the time your brain first became capable of storing up thoughts and impressions.</p>
    <p>"Eventually I remembered. But I had to write it out. It had been written, not spoken. The Indio language is a degraded version of it. Just the same Parror figured it out. And he's going to waken the Flame, when he gets the equipment ready."</p>
    <p>"That's dangerous," Raft said.</p>
    <p>"I suppose it is. Still--" Craddock looked at his deformed hands. "--I risked it once. Blindly, of course. Parror knows what he's doing."</p>
    <p>Raft thought of that tremendous power unleashed and raging unchecked through Paititi. "I wonder."</p>
    <p>Craddock shivered a little. "I hope so, Brian! If the Flame ever gets out of control, the game is over."</p>
    <p>"We'd better get out of here. This isn't a safe spot. Are you able to walk yet?"</p>
    <p>"Sure, if you can help me a little."But Craddock was stiff weak, and he needed more than a little assistance as they retraced their steps through the saffron jungle. Raft supported him over the rougher spots, and he leaned heavily on the younger man's arm.</p>
    <p>They kept a sharp eye out for Parror, though Raft felt certain that the Flame's guardian had left the Garden by now, intent upon gathering the equipment he would need for the ultimate experiment.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, there was still danger. Kharn--watched. Raft could sense the hidden, reptilian menace lurking in the yellow shadows under the trees.</p>
    <p>They were almost at the river-gap when Raft touched Crad-dock's arm and they halted. There was something ahead, blocking their path. Not the nerve-bushes, but a sickly, saffron thing which lay like half-solid dough along the bank for twenty feet or more. Raft's brows contracted.</p>
    <p>"It wasn't here before," he said slowly. "I don't like it."</p>
    <p>Craddock straightened and drew a deep breath. "Guess I'll have to stand on my own feet for awhile. You may need both hands. See those pseudopods sliding this way? The thing's alive."</p>
    <p>"An amoeba?"</p>
    <p>"It isn't that. It's--there's no sharp line of demarcation between animal and vegetable here. It may be protoplasm but, I think, it's allied to those fern-mushrooms. If it caught us we'd probably get digested. However, it's slow."</p>
    <p>"Yeah. But it's big. You feel up to running?"</p>
    <p>Craddock drew himself together. "Okay. Where?"</p>
    <p>"Let's move along the shallows here and then run like blazes for the tunnel."</p>
    <p>Craddock nodded. They stepped into a cold, slow current and waded forward, feeling the water slide leisurely around their legs as they watched the jellied, saffron entity on the bank. They came abreast of it, and the tunnel-mouth lay only a little way ahead.</p>
    <p>Raft began to think, as he splashed on, that they would make the tunnel without trouble after all. The monster of Kharn, he told himself, was not a creature of action. Its danger lay in the mind. It used purely mental power to attract and overpower its prey. Nor was it accustomed to highly developed minds, able to resist. Perhaps it had never needed to develop physical offense.</p>
    <p>The water suddenly boiled just before them, sliding with nightmare slowness from a round saffron arm. A pseudopod, stretching after them from the bank, broke the surface. Another lifted out of the water close behind it.</p>
    <p>They tried to circle farther out to avoid them, but the footing shelved off steeply into dangerous depths. The pseudopod reached inexorably out--farther--farther--and touched Raft.</p>
    <p>It was filled with a living, hothouse warmth that made his flesh crawl. It wound about his waist, its moist heat striking inward against his skin as if digestion were already at work upon him.</p>
    <p>He felt its strong pull toward the bank. He tried to get out his knife, but another coil came up from somewhere and laid a warm, wet embrace about his arms, fastening them to his sides. He felt himself being pulled shoreward, and struggled hard to keep his footing in the slow water.</p>
    <p>"Hold firm, Brian!"</p>
    <p>Craddock stumbled forward, lips set, fighting his own weakness.</p>
    <p>He got the knife from Raft's belt with a violent surge of effort, and slashed at the tentacle. That yellowish, half-fungoid flesh gave like cheese. It had surface tension, apparently, but it was not more than half solid. Craddock slashed, and the pseudopods fell away and were washed slowly, slowly off down the current. The incident was like a nightmare in its gentle, deliberate, inexorable sluggishness.</p>
    <p>The whole mass of the thing was sliding into the stream now.</p>
    <p>"Come on," Raft said. "Can you make it?"</p>
    <p>He seized Craddock's arm as they ran for the archway, the water sucking like glue around their feet.</p>
    <p>On their right the entire bank seemed to be giving way and dropping toward them in a hungry, malignant pile that could afford to take its time.</p>
    <p>Craddock's weakness hampered them. The water parted reluctantly under their splashing feet. It was like running through semi-liquid rubber, with the great, slow, yellow thing rolling its bulk forward to intercept their way.</p>
    <p>The mouth of the tunnel opened before them, and the nerve-networks that acted as sentries made a quick, concerted, abortive motion to stop them, as if the whole valley answered a single brain, as perhaps it did. But Craddock slashed weakly at them with the knife, and when the blade had severed two or three the rest shrank and folded down out of harm's way as the two men plunged through.</p>
    <p>"They've--stopped," Craddock panted, glancing back. "They won't--follow outside, I guess."</p>
    <p>"Keep going," Raft urged him grimly. "No use taking chances now."</p>
    <p>They stumbled on, out of the gloom at last into the cool green light from the leafy vault, far overhead, that roofed Paititi. It was like finding sanctuary.</p>
    <p>But not quite. A quarter of a mile away, rounding one of the giant trees, a little column was moving steadily toward them. Raft groaned.</p>
    <p>"Darum's soldiers. That looks like--yeah, it's Vann, all right. Come on, Craddock. Maybe we can make it."</p>
    <p>"I--I can't." The older man staggered as he tried to keep up with Raft's quick strides. "Go on ahead. Don't mind about me."</p>
    <p>Raft halted and shrugged. "They'd have caught us anyway. We'll wait, I guess. And fight it out." He touched the butt of the revolver, and watched that glittering column draw nearer.</p>
    <p>Finally, the column deployed, showing two score of soldiers, wary, armed men who spread out to surround their prisoners. Vann's scarred, hard face was impassive.</p>
    <p>"You're captives," he said. "There'll be time for a duel later, if you want, but the king needs you both now. So you are Brian Raft, after all, eh? And this.man is Craddock?" He stared curiously.</p>
    <p>"What does Darum intend to do?" Raft asked. "Cut my throat?"</p>
    <p>"No," Vann said. "Not yet, at least. Where is Parror?"</p>
    <p>"Gone. I don't know where."</p>
    <p>"We'll find him." Vann issued swift orders. Half of the group broke up, spreading out into the forest.</p>
    <p>"Now we'll go back to Doirada Castle. Meanwhile, you can tell me, Raft, what lies in the Garden of Kharn. I'd have entered it to carry out my orders, but not with any pleasure. What devils lair in Kharn?"</p>
    <p>"I'll tell you later," Raft said wearily. He let the revolver drop back into his pocket. "Right now, I'm too tired to care. Let's go back to Doirada."</p>

    <p>QUIETLY THEY STOOD before the king, waiting, in the dim-lit room where Yrann's harp had sung. But it was brighter now. The veiled woman was not around. In her place Janissa sat on a cushioned couch near the dais. She had looked at Raft once, given him a cryptic smile, and turned back to watch Darum, who squatted cross-legged amid his silks.</p>
    <p>Darum watched Raft out of hooded eyes.</p>
    <p>"You think I am going to kill you," he said. "Why? Don't trouble to answer. I can read that much in your face. Because you tried to kill me, with that knife Vann took from you. Also because you stole my amulet."</p>
    <p>Raft attempted to speak, but the king lifted his hand.</p>
    <p>"Wait. Your race is not as mine. I see no great evil in your attempt at murder. You'd have succeeded had you deserved to succeed. Since you didn't--" He nodded "--it is over and done with. What is past is past. Tomorrow you may try again, or I may, and succeed. And I will take back the amulet too. Meanwhile, Janissa has told me a great deal."</p>
    <p>"When I found you'd escaped, Brian--I told Darum," the girl said. "I knew you'd gone after Parror."</p>
    <p>"Yes," the king said silkily. "And I wanted Parror. He goes too far, I think. After all, I rule in Paititi, not Parror."</p>
    <p>"For a while," Raft said quietly. "If he starts the Flame, and it gets out of control, you won't rule anything."</p>
    <p>"So he learned Craddock's secret." Darum sighed. "He is outlawed now. Every man's hand is against him. And I have guarded the unseen road so he cannot enter it. I do not think he will reach the Flame."</p>
    <p>"Parror is clever," Janissa said.</p>
    <p>Craddock broke in.</p>
    <p>"He'll need instruments. I know that much. It'll take time."</p>
    <p>Darum shrugged.</p>
    <p>"I am no scientist. I know only that there is danger both ways. If the Flame fades below a danger level--well, Janissa? What then?"</p>
    <p>"We will become as the cavern-beasts," she told him. "We will degenerate as the First Race did."</p>
    <p>"But when that day will come none can say. In our lifetime, or our children's, or perhaps not even then. And if Parror tries to rouse the Flame, and fails to check it, that will mean immediate destruction."</p>
    <p>"He doesn't think so," Craddock said. "He's sure he can control the Flame."</p>
    <p>"But can he?" Darum leaned forward. "That is what I seek to know. Can he--surely?"</p>
    <p>"I wish I knew," Craddock said. "Parror got certain memories out of my mind, but they were mere superficial memories, not knowledge. I don't even know what most of the symbols I wrote down, for him meant. I didn't know thirty years ago, when I translated part of the record."</p>
    <p>"The record that was destroyed when the Flame wakened," Darum said. "A secret only Parror and you know now?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know," Craddock said. "It was dragged out of my mind by hypnosis. I wasn't conscious most of the time. I've only the vaguest idea what Parror intends to do."</p>
    <p>"Well, the first step is to capture Parror, so he won't rouse the Flame," Darum said practically. "I hope my guards will find him soon. Meanwhile, how am I to deal with you two?"</p>
    <p>"Why not just let us go?" Raft said slowly.</p>
    <p>"Simians are too curious. Your race would try to enter Paititi. Two species, both dominant, cannot live together successfully."</p>
    <p>"Why not?" Raft asked. "There's the possibility of mutual benefit."</p>
    <p>"Our minds are too unlike."</p>
    <p>"I think you underestimate Parror, Darum," Janissa said. "He's clever, and he has more knowledge than I. There are--powers connected with the Rame that not even I understand. But Parror understands them. Also, I have heard legends of a secret way to reach the cave where Curupuri burns."</p>
    <p>"He must not reach the Flame!" Darum said.</p>
    <p>Raft glanced at Janissa, and drew courage from her steady gaze. "Suppose he does though. In spite of everything. That means that he'll waken the Flame. If he makes a mistake, nothing can save Paititi. Right?"</p>
    <p>The king nodded.</p>
    <p>"True."</p>
    <p>"All right," Raft said."Here's an answer. Forestall him."</p>
    <p>Darum jerked his head up to stare.</p>
    <p>"Waken the Rame ourselves?"</p>
    <p>"Why not?" Raft asked. "We've got the science of two cultures here in this room, which gives us an edge on Parror. Janissa knows the Rame. She's its hereditary guardian. I know biochemistry, and Craddock isn't a layman. And you must have technicians here."</p>
    <p>"We do."</p>
    <p>"Well, then, what's to prevent us from making the device ourselves?"</p>
    <p>"The question of possible failure," Darum said. "The First Race never tested their machine. They waited too long. There is absolutely no way of fortelling whether it would actually control the Rame. Trial and error is the only way, and one error means destruction."</p>
    <p>"There is a way," Raft said.</p>
    <p>Janissa breathed a question.</p>
    <p>Raft took out the amulet. Seeing it, the king's eyes narrowed.</p>
    <p>"You know what this is, Darum. It holds a spark of Rame. It is the Hame, but too tiny to be very dangerous. Why not use this as the control? If this spark from the Rame itself can be stimulated, and leashed, you'd know the machine was successful.</p>
    <p>Darum shrugged.</p>
    <p>"Parror may have the same idea," Raft continued. "I hope so. But in case he doesn't, we'll have the jump on him, and know definitely whether the device the First Ones planned is safe."</p>
    <p>Darum hesitated.</p>
    <p>"Perhaps that is true."</p>
    <p>Raft talked fast. "If this works, it'll remove the menace of the Rame forever. It'll mean complete control of that source of energy. The threat of degeneration will be removed from Paititi completely. Suppose we do fail--we'll simply.be right back here where we stand now, won't we?"</p>
    <p>"He's right," Janissa said breathlessly. "It's a chance, Darum. The only one, if Parror outwits us. And it may mean safety for Paititi forever."</p>
    <p>Darum did not speak for a long moment. Then he nodded slowly.</p>
    <p>"I agree, then. Janissa, this is in your hands. And now leave me. We will talk later."</p>
    <p>The girl led them out. Behind them the lights dimmed, and, as Raft moved along the passage that led from the king's chamber, he heard a murmuring of faint music.</p>
    <p>Yrann. Should he have warned the king against her? Perhaps. But he doubted whether Darum would have believed him. He shelved the thought for future reference.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile Craddock was pulling at his arm.</p>
    <p>"Brian."</p>
    <p>"Well?"</p>
    <p>"I didn't want to queer the pitch, but--" His voice lowered "--you forgot one thing. I can't remember what Parror dragged out of my mind. He forced it out with his gadget, but I was in a trance. I don't remember now."</p>
    <p>Janissa had overheard even Craddock's soft whisper.</p>
    <p>"It is well you didn't mention that to Darum," she said. "But I think the problem can be solved. I don't know what device Parror used. Nevertheless, when a gate has been opened once, it opens more easily the next time. I have some knowledge of the mind, Craddock, and possibly we can succeed."</p>
    <p>"We'll get it out of you," Raft said. "If it means a course in psychonamics!"</p>
    <p>It did, almost. Raft had used medical hypnosis himself, and could help Janissa, who otherwise might have been hindered by the alienage of minds, the more than racial difference between Craddock's thought-patterns and her own. But with Raft as mentor, the secret wisdom was slowly, painfully pulled into the light.</p>
    <p>They did not sleep. Some drug like benzedrine, Raft guessed, kept them alert and stimulated for their long sessions. There was technical equipment in the castle, and there were scientists as well, though their knowledge lay chiefly in the realm of the psychic. Many allied sciences were represented among the cat-people. Surgery was, highly developed, as was biology.</p>
    <p>It was Craddock's subconscious they were probing, and it was like fishing in a teeming pool. Too often they caught the wrong fish, till they learned the right sort of bait to use. But finally symbols began to take form on the pad that was always ready to Craddock's hand. He scribbled a line--hesitated, corrected himself--and, step by step, pieced out the record he had read only once, thirty years before, but which his subconscious mind had never forgotten.</p>
    <p>"If Parror hadn't opened the way, we'd never be able to do this," Janissa said later as she was standing on a balcony with Raft, taking a well-earned breathing-space after a particularly arduous session. Before them the slow cloud of mist hung like an enormous tower.</p>
    <p>Raft looked at her. He remembered his half-mocking question of long ago, whether two species could mingle. But logic did not seem so important now. The warm, living presence of Janissa was more vital.</p>
    <p>Till lately he had not known her, really. She had been a paradoxical, fascinating girl who had revealed few of the traits that make humanity human. But now, since they had been working together, he had come to understand her more, and to know that he would never be able to understand her fully.</p>
    <p>That sweetly curved, softly malicious little face, with its hint of diablerie, its lovely, feline strangeness, was more attractive than he dared admit to himself. The aquamarine, shadowed eyes were turned up to his... Eyes of Bast, whose velvet aloofness guards the night of Egypt. Yet she could be playful too, gay as a kitten might be, and with the same endearing charm.</p>
    <p>Now as he stood there, something hidden and secret flashed between them. There was no need for a physical embrace. It was subtler than that. But, briefly, it seemed as though a veil had been lifted, a veil that hung between two beings who had been alien.</p>
    <p>His hand stole out and touched hers. They looked out across Doirada Gulf, to the colossal columns of giant trees that supported the sky of Paititi.</p>
    <p>He thought, Only here in this lost land beyond space and time, could I have found Janissa.</p>
    <p>They were silent. Speech was not necessary. Hand jn hand they stood, lost in the warm, comforting awareness of each other's presence, until Craddock's voice called them back to the work of harnessing the Flame.</p>
    <p>What could harness such a tremendous force, a power which burned in the heart of the spiral nebulae and kindled giant suns? The chain that bound Fenris-wolf? What was the Flame?</p>
    <p>They did not know. But men do not know what electricity is, either. Yet they can tame it with insulated wires. What was needed here was insulation, but not only that. There must also be a means of stimulating the Flame. A safe way.</p>
    <p>That was not easy to find. First the last fragments of the lost record had to be taken from Craddock's mind. Time after time hypnosis probed into his memories, and gradually the cryptic symbols made longer lines on the recording pad. Janissa could read those symbols for her own language was founded upon it, as her own civilization was built on the earlier culture of the vanished First Race. Also technicians were helpful.</p>
    <p>For there were semantic difficulties. Raft knew the Indio dialect thoroughly, but he did not know the intricacies of Jan-issa's more highly developed language. There were symbols she could not explain to him. Then a chemist, perhaps, would sketch charts, electro-chemical hookups, or atomic patterns, until the answer clicked in Raft's mind.</p>
    <p>He was no technician, though, and could not have built the device alone. Nor could Janissa. But his different background of human science was invaluable in casting light from another angle on the problem. There was the matter of the amulet, for example.</p>
    <p>"When you turn the stone, it slows down metabolism," Raft pointed out. "That means the radiation is blocked at a variable rate. What blocks it? Something opaque to the vibration, eh?"</p>
    <p>"The metal?" a physicist hazarded. "It's-an alloy of chrom-ite. Vanadium, perhaps. We'll have it tested."</p>
    <p>For, though the last secrets of the records in Craddock's memory had been discovered by now, there were still gaps. In the days of the First Race, different elements had existed in the valley, elements which were now exhausted.</p>
    <p>They found that the truth lay not only in the material of the amulet's setting, but in the intricate interlocking of alloys, a very tiny machine powered by the induced radiation of the energy-source itself, the spark in the crystal. That crystal was simply quartz, but how the radiant atom had been put into it Raft couldn't guess.</p>
    <p>The secret, then, lay in a complicated arrangement of various alloys that seemed to block the energy-output of the spark. Part of this knowledge they gleaned from Craddock's hypnotically-stimulated memories; the rest they found by simple analysis. There was, finally, a dead end.</p>
    <p>For they knew what elements they needed, and some of them no longer existed in Paititi.</p>
    <p>Then the practical value of an alien culture was demonstrated. Raft thought of the possibility first. He had brought considerable equipment to Paititi in his rucksack, medical supplies, concentrated food in little tins, and there were his personal belongings, as well as Craddock's.</p>
    <p>His watch yielded platinum, which was vital. There was tin to be found in the rucksack, and the firearms were taken apart to provide a treasure of necessary metals.</p>
    <p>The laboratories of the technicians swiftly analyzed the loot, broke it down, and formed new alloys. Given the raw material, they could, at last, work out the equation.</p>
    <p>The machine, when finished, was not large. Specifications had clearly indicated its proportions. It stood on a tripod, coming approximately to Raft's chest, a surprisingly simple device of crystal, metal, and hollow tubes.</p>
    <p>The integral part of it was the fuse, which floated free in a mercury bath atop the gadget. This was the safety, the innocuous-seeming footlong tube that had the power to control the tremendous radiations the rest of the machine was built to stimulate.</p>
    <p>"Parror's bound to fail," Raft said. "Those special alloys--they don't exist in Paititi. He can't possibly make the safety control, and without it he'd know the experiment would be too dangerous."</p>
    <p>Janissa was less certain.</p>
    <p>"Parror has a blind confidence in himself. He might try to substitute other materials. The sooner we test this, Brian, the better I'll feel.</p>
    <p>But the test was not spectacular. The thing was handled by remote control, to minimize the danger. Even with the tiny spark of energy in the amulet, there was peril.</p>
    <p>Raft used a scanning glass to examine the amulet, five hundred feet away on the mossy plain. He looked briefly around the crowd that surrounded him--Craddock, Janissa, the technician and, with a silent prayer, turned on the power. Nothing happened. Machine and amulet remained as they had been.</p>
    <p>"Doesn't it power the spark?" Janissa breathed.</p>
    <p>"It ought to stimulate it," Raft said, and moved the needle on his rheostat device. He moved-it too far. From the amulet a spear of light shot straight up, and simultaneously the moss for a hundred feet around sprang into--life! It writhed and crawled visibly, the ordinary progress of growth accelerated incredibly by die radiation of the stimulated spark.</p>
    <p>Hastily Raft adjusted the rheostat. But he was smiling. He knew, without the need for further experiment, that the machine was a success. It remained now only to discover whether its power could control the Flame itself. Raft thought it could, since it would, via induction, have all the Flame's power.</p>
    <p>But the danger struck too soon.</p>

    <p>BRIAN RAFT WAKENED to see Janissa's face above him. The light she carried glowed through the darkened room.</p>
    <p>"Brian!"</p>
    <p>He blinked at her.</p>
    <p>"Janissa--what's wrong?"</p>
    <p>"It's Parror," she said. "I've touched his mind. He's on his way to the Flame."</p>
    <p>That brought Raft bolt upright. "Good god! You're sure?"</p>
    <p>She nodded, her eyes shadowed with fear.</p>
    <p>"His barrier slipped for an instant. I had been watching my mirror and, suddenly, I felt his thought. He goes by a secret way to waken the Flame."</p>
    <p>"Where is he now?"</p>
    <p>"In the forest somewhere. I could not tell. I could see only what he intended, and the secret way he will take. Brian, we must stop him somehow!"</p>
    <p>"We will," Raft said. "Wake up Craddock. Then we'll rouse the king."</p>
    <p>Janissa slipped away, and Raft hastily donned his garments. His mind was working at top speed. He could not have guarded against this contingency, yet he felt at fault. Parror must have a duplicate machine, but it could not possibly be successful, without the special alloys that did not exist in Paititi. If Parror aroused the Flame, disaster would result.</p>
    <p>The three of them went to Darum's suite. Vann was guarding the entrance, since it was the hour for sleep. He stared at them curiously, his scarred soldier's face hard. But when he heard the nature of their errand, he let them pass.</p>
    <p>"Nevertheless, I'd better go with you," he said, falling in at their heels. "Assassinations have been cleverly managed before this."</p>
    <p>Lights softly illuminated Darum's chamber. The king himself was there, relaxed on the cushions of his dais. He sprang awake instantly as they approached. His hand dropped toward the silks and came up with a long-bladed dagger. But he said nothing.</p>
    <p>"There's no need for weapons" Raft growled. "Parror's got his own and he's ready to use it."</p>
    <p>"Parror?" Darum let the knife fall. "You mean--the Flame?"</p>
    <p>"Tell him, Janissa."</p>
    <p>She explained swiftly. The king frowned in indecision.</p>
    <p>"You say his machine will not work?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, it'll work all right, but it will wreck things without the safety device," Raft pointed out. "Our only chance now is to get there before him, if we can. And if we can't, we'll take our own instrument. We may be able to check the Flame before it's too late."</p>
    <p>"I was dreaming a strange dream," Darum said slowly. "I lay dead, I thought, here in my own chamber, and a shadow hung over Paititi. A shadow of light. Of life. But it could not bring life back to me, and it had power only to destroy. I wonder, now, if the vision will come true."</p>
    <p>His voice was remote and strange, as if the memory of the dream had carried him back into the dream itself.</p>
    <p>"It was a true dream, so far as the shadow goes," Janissa said. "There will be death for all of us, unless Parror is stopped."</p>
    <p>"Death!" the king murmured as if he had heard only that one word out of all she said.</p>
    <p>"Death."</p>
    <p>Raft thought he recognized something in the timber of the soft, deep voice. He had heard Darum speak that way before. If the madness was coming back upon the king, at this moment of all moments when action and clear thinking were needed, ghastly things might happen.</p>
    <p>"Parror will reach the Flame before you," Darum said in a soft monotone. "That much I--see." He dropped his head suddenly and hid his face in his hands. "I see no further yet." His voice came muffled. "Death--death in my dream. This room is full of death!"</p>
    <p>The voice was wild now, but his face was still hidden. Madness wailed in the deep resonance of Darum's words, and yet there was conviction too, as if even in his madness he knew he spoke the truth.</p>
    <p>"There is death here," he shrieked. "Too much death for one man. I shall not die alone. I think you must fail with the Flame, Janissa, Craddock, Raft! I think you must fail and doom us all, for this room reeks with death."</p>
    <p>Raft felt a thrill of horror. Utter conviction rang true in the king's voice. Conviction and madness.</p>
    <p>"Death over all Paititi!" said Darum, lifting his face suddenly and showing them a wild and shining glare mat saw nothing before it.</p>
    <p>And suddenly "Death!" wailed a shiver of resounding strings from the curtains behind him. If ever music spoke a word, that music spoke and threatened. The promise was as clear as the sudden flash of a bared blade. It needed no articulation to speak its single syllable of prophecy.</p>
    <p>The curtain swept aside, and Yrann's veiled figure stood there, fingers poised above the still-quivering strings. Faceless and veiled, like the Norn Atropos, ready to cut the thread that held Darum's life.</p>
    <p>For a moment nobody moved. The room was too full of that certainty of doom which Darum's mad voice had made them all believe whether they would or no. For that instant, against all hope and reason, even Craddock, even Raft, knew certainly that there was no chance for life. In the single moment, they were all as mad as the king.</p>
    <p>But only Raft understood what happened next. Only he knew what must have passed through Yrann's clouded mind. Death hung over Doirada Castle and the whole world she knew. The king had spoken, and in this moment there was no doubting the king. And she had waited so long for vengeance. The Flame would rob her of it now, unless--unless--she acted.</p>
    <p>One last wild shrilling cry came shivering from the harp-strings. With the same motion that swept music across the instrument she flung the harp aside, letting it crash to the floor with a last jangling discord of its own.</p>
    <p>She moved forward with a swift, stooping rush toward the couch. Her white hand, darting from the"veils, was like a flung weapon in itself as she snatched up the long dagger he had dropped. Headlong, she hurled herself against him, swinging the blade like a scythe.</p>
    <p>He was off guard. He tried to rise, to leap away from the blade's glittering descent, but the tangling silks caught and betrayed him. He managed only to writhe, aside, so that the first blow only raked his ribs in a glancing wound. Yrann, still silent, brought up the knife again with deadly singleness of purpose.</p>
    <p>Then Raft had her.</p>
    <p>He felt her arch against his restraining arm with the desperate strength he remembered from their other struggle in this room, and a shock of unreasonable horror went through him as that veiled face turned to his.</p>
    <p>She flung herself against his grip with a cat's sudden, explosive fury, and with one last frantic surge broke free. Springing back, still gripping the dagger, she turned her faceless gaze toward the king.</p>
    <p>He was on his feet now, facing her, ready. Her chance was gone. She knew it. They could see the knowledge slacken the tautness of the lovely body beneath her veils. They heard her sigh once, deeply, in the tense silence of the room.</p>
    <p>Then she moved suddenly, her draperies swirling like slow smoke, and sank the knife hilt-deep in her own heart!</p>
    <p>Motionless, speechless, they watched her sink to the floor. Red came slowly out through the gray veils pinned by the knife against her.</p>
    <p>Darum brushed past Raft. He knelt beside Yrann. His hand went out, poising over the veiled face. But he did not touch the gauzy webs that hid her.</p>
    <p>"Yrann?" he said. "Yrann?"</p>
    <p>But she did not stir. The red stain widened upon the gray.</p>
    <p>Darum's fingers closed upon the hilt that stood up from her chest. He knelt there for a heartbeat, his hand caressing the weapon as if it were Yrann herself. Then his grip tightened.</p>
    <p>He tore the knife free, dripping scarlet drops, and rose in a lithe, inhuman motion, facing Raft. His lips had flattened back, and the light in his eyes was the dark blaze of pure madness. He lifted the blade, and the red drops spattered in an arch across the carpet.</p>
    <p>Raft stood motionless, his mind racing. He was too close to the king, and he was unarmed. There was no way of escaping that blow, unless he came to grips with the man, and he had no illusions about which of the two was stronger. Power flowed tremendously through the feline's rippling body, and madness lent it double strength.</p>
    <p>"You saved my life," he said in a hissing snarl. "You came between us! You turned the knife against her as surely as if you held the blade. What use do you think life is to me now?" His features convulsed in the mad inhumanity of feline rage. "You--ape!"</p>
    <p>Darum sprang.</p>
    <p>From behind Raft a thin, shining flash of light darted, to quench itself in the king's throat. Darum's body arched. He strained to take one step more forward--to keep the dagger raised for its blow --</p>
    <p>Then with shocking suddenness, all the strength went out of him and he dropped to the silks with the lithe, silken limpness of the silks themselves. His fingers released the dagger, and he pulled the rapier from his throat, blood gushing from wound and mouth as it came free.</p>
    <p>"Vann," he said, and coughed. "Vann. We have dueled before--but never thus!"</p>
    <p>Vann's deep voice answered heavily.</p>
    <p>"I served you, Darum, but I serve Paititi first. Yrann was not worth any man's love."</p>
    <p>"She was so beautiful," the king whispered. "She could not bear to die--with Paititi--without slaying me. She hated me always. And--and--" He tried to choke back blood.</p>
    <p>He lifted himself on suddenly strong arms and dragged himself forward a few feet. He ran gentle fingers down the dead woman's arm. Her harp lay where it had fallen, almost beneath her fingers. He touched the strings, and their sad music hung forlornly in the quiet air.</p>
    <p>"I would have crushed Paititi," Darum said. "I would have--crushed the world--for her. Rather than have her harmed. She was so beautiful."</p>
    <p>The king's head fell upon the soft body of Yrann. The tiger eyes closed. One hand sought for and found Yrann's.</p>
    <p>His blood mingled with hers.</p>
    <p>The red stream flowed slower and slower --</p>
    <p>And flowed no more.</p>
    <p>Vann stood motionless, his heavy shoulders sagging.</p>
    <p>"Go now, while there's time," he said. "I did this to save Paititi, and now I find myself wondering whether I have struck steel into the wrong throat."</p>
    <p>"Vann," Janissa said.</p>
    <p>"Take them away, Janissa. Take these men from another world out of the king's presence. Let them stop Parror if they can."</p>
    <p>"Parror?" Craddock whispered. He touched Raft's arm. "We'll have to move fast."</p>
    <p>"Yes," Raft said tonelessly.</p>
    <p>He turned and led the way out of the chamber. His face was gray, and sweat stood out in fine droplets on his cheeks.</p>
    <p>Once outside, he did not mention the king.</p>
    <p>"We'll need the machine," he said. "It's a portable, so we can manage the weight. But I'll want some straps."</p>
    <p>They found silken scarves that would do as well, and the machine was adjusted on Raft's back. The light alloys made its weight less than its bulk would have indicated. That would help, since fast travel would be necessary if they hoped to forestall Parror.</p>
    <p>Silently they left the castle, darkened now for the sleep-period. Outside the cool, clear daylight of Paititi was dazzling.</p>
    <p>"We should have remembered weapons," Craddock said.</p>
    <p>"It's too late now," Raft told him. "Janissa, you'll guide. Do you know the secret way to the Flame?"</p>
    <p>"I think I can find it, yes. The thought in Parror's mind was clear enough. But it is a long way."</p>
    <p>Yet it was shorter than they expected. They did not head for Parror's castle. They angled off toward the base of the rock barrier that guarded Paititi. Four hours of fast travel brought them to it. There, however, time was lost as Janissa searched for the secret entrance.</p>
    <p>"There are ruins here," she said. "Ruins of the Old Race. There should be a double column. Parror was thinking of it when I read his mind."</p>
    <p>Silently Raft pointed. With a little cry Janissa ran to the spot he indicated. She felt the smooth surface of the rock-face, searching for a key.</p>
    <p>Silently, smoothly, an oval opened in the bare stone.</p>
    <p>Raft turned to stare back the way they had come.</p>
    <p>"No sign of Parror," he said. "He may be ahead of us. Or he may not. We'll soon know." He followed Janissa and Craddock into the opening. Behind him the hidden door closed.</p>
    <p>But they were not in darkness. A pale, cool glow came from the walls and roof and the smooth floor on which they stood. The tunnel wound upward at a steep slant, and the silence made Raft feel the blood beating in his ears.</p>
    <p>"Come on," he said, shouldering the machine.</p>
    <p>It was not long, that passage in the cliff. It made a shortcut through the rock to the cavern of the Rame. But, before them there was another cavern.</p>
    <p>Ah oval door barred their path. Janissa opened it easily, bur she did not pass through the portal. Raft saw her slender figure poise, hesitate, and shrink back. He brushed past Craddock.</p>
    <p>"What is it?" he asked.</p>
    <p>Janissa did not answer.</p>
    <p>"The First Race," Craddock said, in a breathless voice. "The First Race."</p>
    <p>It was the cavern Raft had seen when he had first entered Paititi. Leprous violet light bathed the dripping stalactites and crept over the thrusting stalagmites that made an upthrust forest. High overhead, slanting down at a dizzyi angle, was the gravity-defying, nearly transparent tube of the unseen road, made visible now only because of the hordes of creatures that crawled upon it, as though striving to break through the glassy barrier.</p>
    <p>The monsters!</p>
    <p>Raft had seen them before, but only dimly. Now he felt his throat go dry and close with loathing.</p>
    <p>Bat-winged and beast-snouted, degenerate and horrible, the things swarmed in the violet light there in the great cave. They were the descendants of what had once been the First Race, the mighty civilization that had reared the proud castles of Paititi.</p>
    <p>And fallen now--fallen into the primal pit of horror.</p>
    <p>The baleful radiations that had once raged through Paititi when the Flame waned long ago and had changed them to demons. Few were alike. Some had immense bat-wings, while others flopped and dragged their fat, shining bulks among the stalagmites. And some were dwarfed. Some were giants. Some had the clawed feet of giant birds.</p>
    <p>Straight as a lance across that arena of terror ran the path they had been following, a faint white glow that ended at the farther wall, before an oval panel that was obviously a door.</p>
    <p>"Through--there?" Craddock said.</p>
    <p>Raft looked at Janissa. She was white-faced, but she caught her breath and stepped out of the tunnel's protection, into the violet light of the cavern.</p>
    <p>"We'll run for it," Raft said. "If we can reach that other door, we'll be all right."</p>
    <p>They ran, panic spurring their heels. The sight of the nightmare horde flapping and crawling and leaping all about them was horrible. And the thought of those black talons actually touching them--it was not a good thought.</p>
    <p>A stir went through the monsters, a ripple of interest. As Raft ran, he saw from the corners of his eyes that shapes were converging upon them. But the three were more than halfway across the cavern now, and there was more than an even chance mat they could reach their goal before the monsters rallied to investigate.</p>
    <p>Raft reckoned without the winged beings. Something struck him heavily from behind, sending him to his knees. He struggled to regain his feet. Janissa, glancing back, saw what had happened, and with a little cry, ran back to help him.</p>
    <p>A nightmare shape, scaled and horned like a medieval demon, sprang at her--caught her in its grip.</p>
    <p>Cursing, Raft plunged forward, heedless of the creature on his back. His fist smashed out into the face of the monster. It was driven back, screaming in a thin, high-pitched wail of agony.</p>
    <p>That was the signal. From all around the devils of Paititi swooped and lumbered and dragged themselves toward the intruders. Raft went down under the weight of foul-smelling bodies. He was blind with nausea and hatred and revulsion. His fists hammered a pulpy flesh, and the shrieking grew to a shrill crescendo.</p>
    <p>That sickening odor almost choked him. The touch of the monsters against his skin was loathsome. They felt like fungoid things, like dead creatures raised to a ghastly similitude of life. And the faces were ghoulish demons.</p>
    <p>Craddock came back to use as a spear a fallen stalactite he had picked up. Raft was relieved of his burden for a moment. He staggered up, looking for Janissa.</p>
    <p>He saw her, in the midst of a group of monsters.</p>
    <p>He had enough reasoning power left to find another fallen spike of stone before going to her rescue. The creatures, interbred and degenerate, were physically weak, but they had the advantage of numbers, and Raft realized that the sheer weight of those deformed bodies could press him down and smother him. His lips lifted in a snarl, he charged forward, stabbing with his improvised spear.</p>
    <p>He felt flesh tear. He heard the squealing redouble in volume. The monsters came at him like a wave. They had the feeble malevolence of rats. As he went down on his back he tried desperately to turn, to shield the precious burden he carried--and failed.</p>
    <p>He heard the machine's crash as it was crushed against the rock beneath him.</p>
    <p>There was only hopelessness then, and blind hatred, and a feeling that he was drowning in floods of evil, living flesh. But he fought on. The remnants of the machine were ripped from his back. He lashed about him savagely with the sharp stalactite, till at last he had cleared a little space free of the monsters.</p>
    <p>As he stood there, panting and half-naked, he saw that they had fought their way almost to the door. But at his feet coils and broken crystal and twisted metal told of the wreck of the machine that could save Paftiti.</p>
    <p>One thing remained whole--a foot-long cylinder of burnished alloy. It was the safety fuse that controlled the device's stimulating power. Raft snatched it up and thrust the tube into his belt.</p>
    <p>"Brian," Craddock called. "Here!"</p>
    <p>Raft lifted his spear and rushed. The monsters had learned the menace of that sharp spike of stone by now, and there was a little flurry as they gave back. Janissa was with Craddock, the two of them back to back, though the girl was unarmed. But she was bristling with fury, her hands clawed, like a cat roused to anger.</p>
    <p>"The door," Raft said. "Open it, Janissa."</p>
    <p>He cut a red path for her. The worst danger was the flying monsters. More than once Raft swung up his weapon in time to rip the flesh of a swooping demon that came rushing down at him from the violet depths above. He fought on, grimly silent, conscious only of those devil-masks, distorted and horrible, glaring at him, spouting crimson as he struck, screaming in thin, wailing agony.</p>
    <p>"Brian!" Janissa shrilled. "The door!"</p>
    <p>He saw with surprise that it lay open. Craddock, white hair flying, broke through with a stumbling rush. Together the two charged that waiting portal.</p>
    <p>They reeled through it. Raft whirled, thrust out at a pressing horde of monsters, as Janissa's hand swept out.</p>
    <p>The oval door closed--barring the cavern.</p>
    <p>The high screaming gave place to silence.</p>
    <p>"They smashed the machine," Raft said hopelessly.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>
     <p>RAFT CHOOSES</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>CRADDOCK WAS PANTING with excitement. His eyes were tired looking and weary.</p>
    <p>"You saved the safety fuse," he said. "Maybe that's enough. If Parror's machine is a duplicate of the one we built, maybe we have a chance, even yet."</p>
    <p>"It has to be, unless the man's a complete fool," Raft said. "But if we can stop him before he wakens the Flame, that'd be even better." He caught himself and laughed. "Parror's probably behind us, not ahead of us. If he passed through that cavern, they'd have broken his gadget too."</p>
    <p>"Unless he knew another route," Janissa put in somberly. She tried to adjust her tattered garments, with fastidious, feline delicacy. Raft thought, watching her, even now she's half cat.</p>
    <p>Then something quivered through the air about them, a burning shaking vibration that raced through their bodies, quickening the living flesh and was gone. A low thunder faded into silence.</p>
    <p>White-faced, Janissa turned to Raft. Her hands went out helplessly.</p>
    <p>"The Flame!" she said. "It--wakes!"</p>
    <p>With a curse, Raft sprinted forward, the others at his heels. To fail now, so close to success, would be intolerable. The tunnel was miles long, it seemed.</p>
    <p>It ended at last, though not before that warning vibration had rushed in deep thunder through them twice more. Each time the effect was stronger. Each time the force grew more vital, more alive.</p>
    <p>Janissa fumbled at the door, searching for the key. At last, the panel slipped away and was gone.</p>
    <p>They stepped out on a small balcony of rock, from which, a curving ramp twisted down to--to what?"</p>
    <p>It was dark, too dark to make out details clearly. Emptiness, it seemed, stretched far out above and below them.</p>
    <p>Yet there was light. It was too faint to be more than a hint, or else it was too far away below him. Raft leaned on that dizzy railing and stared down, down, down almost to the bottom of the world, an immeasurable gulf in which one flicker of brilliance gleamed.</p>
    <p>But it was not vertigo that struck Raft then. It was fear.</p>
    <p>Fear plain and simple, and reasonless. He knew that feeling.</p>
    <p>Once, in Madagascar, he had had to go through a guard-hut where sentries were sleeping. A noise, a false move, would have meant spears through his body. He had known then that they were going to waken. He had felt it, with every bit of his mind and every inch of his skin.</p>
    <p>Like that. Something down below, where the light was, so vitally alive that he felt himself standing on its palm.</p>
    <p>And something more as well. It was the jungle. Or the life that makes up the jungle. Steaming, fertile Amazon forests, roaring rivers, all that teeming, tremendous life that stirs in the green moist heat of the tropics. Blind and terrible and hungry--there in the abyss burned the energy that rages in the heart of the great nebulae, the destroyer and the awakener--Curupuri!</p>
    <p>"The Flame sleeps," Janissa breathed.</p>
    <p>But in the depths was a distant brightening. A low sound, below the threshold of hearing almost, deepened and grew louder. It became an intolerable thunder, crashing out like the roaring birth-pains of a god.</p>
    <p>From that gulf that dropped toward the heart of the world--far down--very far below--rose the Flame.</p>
    <p>It expanded and lifted, a spear, a tower, a mountain of purest brilliance burning with intolerable fires. It was the essence of life. Raft felt himself, his whole body, swinging toward that kindling torch.</p>
    <p>His mind swept toward it. His soul swung out across the abyss.</p>
    <p>The thunder crashed deafeningly against the walls. The Flame brightened, blazed and towered--pulsing with eagerness--mad with delight--with ecstasy of living.</p>
    <p>Beneath him, Raft saw, was a darker shape. Two shapes. The silhouette of a man, standing beside a machine that was curiously familiar.</p>
    <p>Parror! And the device he had built from the First Race's records!</p>
    <p>As the Flame brightened, Raft sprang toward the descending ramp. He raced down it, praying that he would be in time. That unchecked violence--Parror might not recognize the symptoms, blinded as he was with egotism--but Raft knew that the Flame was wakening uncontrolled.</p>
    <p>The spark in the amulet had not reacted in this manner.</p>
    <p>The galactic force of a nebula--raging unchecked in Paititi. Perhaps loosed on the whole world!</p>
    <p>Down he raced, toward his quarry, while the fires brightened. They blazed with supernal brilliance and began to fade.The column of light slowly sank unwillingly. The thunders subsided.</p>
    <p>Now Raft stood on the glassy, transparent floor of the cave. He looked down once, and reeled dizzily. He was standing unsupported above a gulf that dropped down to earth's burning center.</p>
    <p>He dashed toward Parror. And Parror ran to meet him.</p>
    <p>The light came from below, casting curious shadows on the man's face. Raft saw he was wearing one of the talon-gauntlets, snarling silently as he charged. Raft had no objection to killing Parror, but quelling the Flame was more important. He slowed, pulling the safety fuse from his belt.</p>
    <p>"Parror!" he shouted, in the stillness as the thunders died. "Your machine's out of control! This will restrain it."</p>
    <p>Parror did not even hear. He was lost in a berserk bloodthirst, blind and nearly insane with the demon's rage that Raft had seen before. His clawed fingers, tipped with sharp steel, slashed at Raft's face.</p>
    <p>Raft did not duck quickly enough. His cheek was laid open, agonizing pain darting through him. The fuse spun from his grasp.</p>
    <p>He closed with Parror or tried to. That agile body leaped out of reach. Again the claw ripped down, and again. A blaze of pain stung Raft's chest and side. Raft struck out savagely, but Parror eluded his driving fists.</p>
    <p>Thunder crashed. The light from below brightened.</p>
    <p>The Flame leaped from its bondage, bellowing with delight!</p>
    <p>The fires surged up--poured up--sprang high as though trying to return to their interstellar cradle.</p>
    <p>Again the claw reached out.</p>
    <p>Raft felt a razor drawn across one eye, and sight was suddenly altered. Half-blinded, his cheek torn to the bone, his nose almost ripped away, he sent blow after blow at his elusive enemy.</p>
    <p>Janissa ran in, threw herself between them.</p>
    <p>Parror balled his fist and struck her hard and clean upon the jaw. The girl was flung back, to crumple motionless on that glassy floor.</p>
    <p>"You taught me that, Raft," Parror purred.</p>
    <p>Raft mouthed frenzied curses. If he could only get his hands on that smiling devil, sink his fingers into that bearded neck.</p>
    <p>Intolerably bright blazed the Flame. The thunders raved and crashed within the cavern. This time the star-kindled fires did not sink.</p>
    <p>Higher they rose, and higher--questing--eager. Wakening from slumber to a life beyond the conception of earthly minds!</p>
    <p>Suddenly, amazingly, Raft could see from both eyes again. The agony in face and body was gone. The dripping of blood had stopped. He saw a look of amazement cross Parror's face.</p>
    <p>The radiations from the Flame healed. They rejuvenated living tissue with miraculous speed. They hastened life.</p>
    <p>Craddock's voice cried something. Raft could make out only a word or two through the thunder, but he saw Craddock, thirty feet away, running toward the distant machine. In Craddock's hand was a foot-long cylinder Raft recognized.</p>
    <p>Raft never knew what Parror thought was happening. He saw the cat-man whirl, cry out in a thick, furious voice, and take one step after Craddock.</p>
    <p>One step. No more. For then Raft had him.</p>
    <p>But it was not easy. Raft had never battled a jaguar, but he was battling one now. The mad, raging fury that filled Parror had turned him into a wild beast. The eyes were all green now, blazing with hatred and blood-thirst. Writhing, struggling, gasping, the two crashed down together.</p>
    <p>The Flame rose ever higher. The thunders were an intolerable ache drumming against Raft's skull. That shadowless, inter-galactic light burned into his brain.</p>
    <p>The claw tore at his face, and instantly the wounds healed.</p>
    <p>Snarling, as helpless in the grip of murder-lust as Parror himself, Raft surged to his knees, with an effort not even his enemy's strength could resist. Nothing existed, for a flashing, crimson second, but that red-stained claw.</p>
    <p>He caught Parror's arm in a judo grip, and broke it with savage fury.</p>
    <p>For a moment he held the man motionless. That was.enough. The power of the Flame healed bone and tissue, but Parror's wrist and lower arm jutted out at an impossible angle.</p>
    <p>But he fought on, with teeth and nails and feet, though Raft's fingers were clawed deep into his throat. Inexorably, with the blind savagery of his kind, he fought on until not even the Flame could bring life back to his strangled body.</p>
    <p>Then Raft looked up.</p>
    <p>Far across the cavern stood the machine on its tripod, perilously close to the Flame itself. And moving painfully toward it, like a man breasting a strong wind, was Craddock.</p>
    <p>Craddock?</p>
    <p>Something about that shape made Raft catch his breath. The outline was altering even as he watched. Raft remembered Craddock's maimed hands, and the power that had destroyed them, the same star-born energy that now thundered through the cavern in burning ecstasy of awareness.</p>
    <p>The figure still gripped the fuse-cylinder.</p>
    <p>Raft got to his feet. He began to run after Craddock, but the distance was too great. Nearly at the machine now, the figure was fantastic.</p>
    <p>It was not Craddock. It was not even human any more.</p>
    <p>The living flesh boiled and altered and flowed under the monstrous force that could create whole universes. Something utterly inhuman, at last, stumbled and dragged itself forward into the full blaze of the radiation.</p>
    <p>And yet there was a human purpose.</p>
    <p>It reached the machine. For an instant it crouched there, adjusting the fuse. Beyond it, Curupuri shouted in cataclysmic fury as the fires poured torrentially up from the abyss. One instant of utter madne'ss, while the power of universes, of galaxies, stooped and touched that cavern --</p>
    <p>One instant--and then the thunders died.</p>
    <p>The Flame pulsed once, twice, and sank. With a sigh almost</p>
    <p>human, the fires of life dwindled and dropped into the great gulf.</p>
    <p>There remained, far below, a point of light, burning with unquenchable fires!</p>
    <p>Harnessed!</p>
    <p>The fire that had come from beyond the stars was harnessed.</p>
    <p>Tamed--chained--by the flesh to which it had once, long ago, given life....</p>
    <p>Janissa stirred.</p>
    <p>Fear came into her eyes. She raised herself against Raft's supporting arm to look around questioningly. Then her gaze came back to Raft's.</p>
    <p>"It's over, Janissa," he said. "The Flame sleeps."</p>
    <p>"The machine is working?"</p>
    <p>"Yes. Parror had made a duplicate of ours, after all. But he didn't have the safety fuse. Once Craddock inserted that, it worked."</p>
    <p>"But, Craddock?"</p>
    <p>"He's dead," Raft said quietly. "He died, I suppose, because he had to. The man who once wakened the Flame died to quell it again. This time, I think, the danger is over forever."</p>
    <p>She watched him.</p>
    <p>"I tested the machine," he said. "It's exactly what's needed. The First Race were right, after all. They waited too long to build their own machine, or they'd never have become monsters. Anyway, the Flame will burn, will send out its radiations, at this normal rate forever."</p>
    <p>"Normal?"</p>
    <p>Raft nodded. "I altered the adjustment. Not to the danger-point, but so that metabolism in Paititi will be same as metabolism in my own world. There's no barrier now. The talismans aren't necessary."</p>
    <p>"I can live in your world? It won't be--slow?" "Your world or mine, Janissa," he said. "You can choose." But she had chosen already. And so had Raft. He had made his decision long ago, he thought, the first time he had seen Janissa's face in the little mirror. She had drawn him across the miles into the lost land where the Flame from infinity had burned and, after all, there was no choice. What problems the future might hold could be solved, somehow.</p>
    <p>"We need not go back through the cavern of the monsters," she said. "There is a way to reach the unseen road from here."</p>
    <p>Raft's lips found hers.</p>
    <p>But he was thinking: My world will be strange to you, Janissa. I will make you happy, if I can. And I think I can, for I love you.</p>
    <p>But will you turn back, sometimes, and remember? Will you remember Paititi, and the great trees that hold up the sky? Will you remember the castle above Doirada Gulf, where the white cloud from the cataract hangs forever in the sky?</p>
    <p>Will the heritage of the jaguar stir in your blood, Janissa, to memories I cannot share? Or will you find contentment in my world?</p>
    <p>Silently Raft let Janissa guide him toward the way that led to freedom, and to a destiny he could not foretell. But the girl's hand lay warm in his, and that, for the while, was enough of an answer for them both.</p>

    <p>TO THE north thin smoke made a column against the darkening sky. Again I felt the unreasoning fear, the impulse toward nightmare flight that had been with me for a long time now. I knew it was without reason. There was only smoke, rising from the swamps of the tangled Limberlost country, not fifty miles from Chicago, where man has outlawed superstition with strong bonds of steel and concrete.</p>
    <p>I knew it was only a camper's fire, yet I knew it was not. Something, far back in my mind, knew what the smoke rose from, and who stood about the fire, peering my way through the trees.</p>
    <p>I looked away, my glance slipping around the crowded walls -- shelves bearing the random fruit of my uncle's magpie collector's instinct. Opium pipes of inlaid work and silver, golden chessmen from India, a sword...</p>
    <p>Deep memories stirred within me -- deep panic. I was beneath the sword in two strides, tearing it from the wall, my fingers cramping hard around the hilt. Not fully aware of what I did, I found myself facing the window and the distant smoke again. The sword was in my fist, but feeling wrong, not reassuring, not as the sword ought to feel.</p>
    <p>"Easy, Ed," my uncle's deep voice said behind me. "What's the matter? You look -- sort of wild."</p>
    <p>"It's the wrong sword," I heard myself saying helplessly.</p>
    <p>Then something like a mist cleared from my brain. I blinked at him stupidly, wondering what was happening to me. My voice answered.</p>
    <p>"It isn't the sword. It should have come from Cambodia. It should have been one of the three talismans of the Fire King and the Water King. Three very great talismans -- the fruit of â¢cui, gathered at the time of the deluge, but still fresh -- the rattan with flowers that never fade, and the sword of Yan, the guarding spirit."</p>
    <p>My uncle squinted at me through pipe-smoke. He shook his head.</p>
    <p>"You've changed, Ed," he said in his deep, gentle voice. "You've changed a lot. I suppose because of the war -- it's to be expected. Arid you've been sick. But you never used to be interested in things like that before. I think you spend too much time at the libraries. I'd hoped this vacation would help. The rest --"</p>
    <p>"I don't want rest!" I said violently. "I spent a year and a half resting in Sumatra. Doing nothing but rest in mat smelly little jungle village, waiting and waiting and waiting."</p>
    <p>I could see and smell it now. I could feel again the fever that had raged so long through me as I lay in the tabooed hut.</p>
    <p>My mind went back eighteen months to the last hour when things were normal for me. It was in the closing phases of World War II, and I was flying over the Sumatran jungle. War, of course, is never good or normal, but until that one blinding moment in the air I had been an ordinary man, sure of myself, sure of my place in the world, with no nagging fragments of memory too elusive to catch.</p>
    <p>Then everything blanked out, suddenly and completely. I never knew what it was. There was nothing it could have been. My only injuries came when the plane struck, and they were miraculously light. But I had been whole and unhurt when the blindness and blankness came over me.</p>
    <p>The friendly Bataks found me as I lay in the ruined plane. They brought me through a fever and a raging illness with their strange, crude, effective ways of healing, but I sometimes thought they had done me no service when they saved me. And their witch-doctor had his doubts, too.</p>
    <p>He knew something. He worked his curious, futile charms with knotted string and rice, sweating with effort I did not understand -- then. I remembered the scarred, ugly mask looming out of the shadow, the hands moving in gestures of strange power.</p>
    <p>"Come back, O soul, where thou are lingering in the wood, or in the hills, or by the river. See, I call thee with a toemba bras, with an egg of the fowl Rajah moelija, with the eleven healing leaves...."</p>
    <p>"Yes, they were sorry for me at first, all of them. The witchdoctor was the first to sense something wrong and the awareness spread. I could feel it spreading, as their attitude changed. They were afraid. Not of me, I thought, but of -- what?</p>
    <p>Before the helicopter came to take me back to civilization, the witch-doctor had told me a little. As much, perhaps, as he dared.</p>
    <p>"You must hide, my son. All your life you must hide.</p>
    <p>Something is searching for you -- " He used a word I did not understand. " -- and it has come from the Other World, the ghostlands, to hunt you down. Remember this: all magic things must be taboo to you. And if that too fails, perhaps you may find a weapon in magic. But we cannot help you. Our powers are not strong enough for that."</p>
    <p>He was glad to see me go. They were all glad.</p>
    <p>And after that, unrest. For something had changed me utterly. The fever? Perhaps. At any rate, I didn't feel like the same man. There were dreams, memories -- haunting urgencies as if I had somehow, somewhere left some vital job unfinished.</p>
    <p>I found myself talking more freely to my uncle.</p>
    <p>"It was like a curtain lifting. A curtain of gauze. I saw some things more clearly -- they seemed to have a different significance. Things happen to me now that would have seemed incredible -- before. Now they don't.</p>
    <p>"I've traveled a lot, you know. It doesn't help. There's always something to remind me. An amulet in a pawnshop window, a knotted string, a cat's-eye opal and two figures. I see them in my dreams, over and over. And once --"</p>
    <p>I stopped.</p>
    <p>"Yes?" my uncle prompted softly.</p>
    <p>"It was in New Orleans. I woke up one night and there was something in my room, very close to me. I had a gun -- a special sort of gun -- under my pillow. When I reached for it the -- call it a dog -- sprang from the window. Only it wasn't shaped quite like a dog." I hesitated. "There were silver bullets in the revolver," I said.</p>
    <p>My uncle was silent for a long moment. I knew what he was thinking.</p>
    <p>"The other figure?" he said, finally.</p>
    <p>"I don't know. It wears a hood. I think it's very old. And beyond these two --"</p>
    <p>"Yes?"</p>
    <p>"A voice. A very sweet voice, haunting. A fire. And beyond the fire, a face I have never seen clearly."</p>
    <p>My uncle nodded. The darkness had drawn in; I could scarcely see him, and the smoke outside had lost itself against the shadow of night. But a faint glow still lingered beyond the trees... Or did I only imagine that?</p>
    <p>I nodded toward the window.</p>
    <p>"I've seen that fire before," I told him.</p>
    <p>"What's wrong with it? Campers make fires."</p>
    <p>"No. It's a Need-fire."</p>
    <p>"What the devil is that?"</p>
    <p>"It's a ritual," I said. "Like the Midsummer fires, or the Beltane fire the Scots used to kindle. But the Need-fire is lighted only in time of calamity. It's a very old custom."</p>
    <p>My uncle laid down his pipe and leaned forward.</p>
    <p>"What is it, Ed? Do you have any inkling at all?"</p>
    <p>"Psychologically I suppose you could call it a persecution complex," I said slowly. "I believe in things I never used to. I think someone is trying to find me -- has found me. And is calling. Who it is I don't know. What they want I don't know. But a little while ago I found out one more thing -- this sword."</p>
    <p>I picked the sword up from the table.</p>
    <p>"It isn't what I want," I went on, "But sometimes, when my mind is -- abstract, something from outside floats into it. Like the need for a sword. And not any sword -- just one. I don't know what the sword looks like, but I'd know if I held it in my hand." I laughed a little. "And if I drew it a few inches from the sheath, I could put out that fire up there as if I'd blown on it like a candleflame. And if I drew the sword all the way out -- the world would come to an end!"</p>
    <p>My uncle nodded. After a moment, he spoke.</p>
    <p>"The doctors," he asked. "What do they say?"</p>
    <p>"I know what they would say, if I told them," I said grimly. "Pure insanity. If I could be sure of that, I'd feel happier. One of the dogs was killed last night, you know."</p>
    <p>"Of course. Old Duke. Another dog from some farm, eh?"</p>
    <p>"Or a wolf. The same wolf that got into my room last night, and stood over me like a man, and clipped off a lock of my hair."</p>
    <p>Something flamed up far away, beyond the window, and was gone in the dark. The Need-fire.</p>
    <p>My uncle rose and stood looking down at me in the dimness. He laid a big hand on my shoulder.</p>
    <p>"I think you're sick, Ed."</p>
    <p>"You think I'm crazy. Well, I may be. But I've got a hunch I'm going to know soon, one way or the other."</p>
    <p>I picked up the sheathed sword and laid it across my knees. We sat in silence for what seemed like a long time.</p>
    <p>In the forest to the north, the Need-fire burned steadily. I could not see it. But its flames stirred in my blood -- dangerously -- darkly.</p>

     <p>II. Call of the Red Witch</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>I COULD not sleep. The suffocating breathlessness of late summer lay like a woollen blanket over me. Presently I went into the big room and restlessly searched for cigarettes. My uncle's voice came through an open doorway.</p>
    <p>"All right, Ed?"</p>
    <p>"Yeah. I can't sleep yet. Maybe I'll read."</p>
    <p>I chose a book at random, sank into a relaxer chair and switched on a lamp. It was utterly silent. I could not even hear the faint splashing of little waves on the lakeshore.</p>
    <p>There was something I wanted --</p>
    <p>A trained rifleman's hand, at need, will itch for the feeling of smooth wood and metal. Similarly, my hand was hungry for the feel of something -- neither gun nor sword, I thought.</p>
    <p>A weapon that I had used before. I could not remember what it was. Once I glanced at the poker leaning against the fireplace, and thought that was it; but the flash of recognition was gone instantly.</p>
    <p>The book was a popular novel. I skimmed through it rapidly. The dim, faint, pulsing in my blood did not wane. It grew stronger, rising from sub-sensory levels. A distant excitement seemed to be growing deep in my mind.</p>
    <p>Grimacing, I rose to return the book to its shelf. I stood there for a moment, my glance skimming over the titles. On impulse I drew out a volume I had not looked at for many years, the Book of Common Prayer.</p>
    <p>It fell open in my hands. A sentence blazed out from the page.</p>
    <p>I am become as it were a monster unto many.</p>
    <p>I put back the book and returned to my chair. I was in no mood for reading. The lamp overhead bothered me, and I pressed for the switch. Instantly moonlight flooded the room -- and instantly the curious sense of expectancy was heightened, as though I had lowered a -- a barrier.</p>
    <p>The sheathed sword still lay on the window-seat. I looked past it, to the clouded sky where a golden moon shone. Faint, far away, a glimmer showed -- the Need-fire, blazing in the swampy wilderness of the Limberlost.</p>
    <p>And it called.</p>
    <p>The golden square of window was hypnotic. I lay back in my chair, half-closing my eyes, while the sense of danger moved coldly within my brain. Sometimes before I had felt this call, summoning me. And always before I had been able to resist.</p>
    <p>This time I wavered.</p>
    <p>"The lock of hair clipped from my head -- had that given the enemy power? Superstition. My logic called it that, but a deep, inner well of conviction told me that the ancient hair-magic was not merely mummery. Since that time in Sumatra, I had been far less skeptical. And since then I had studied.</p>
    <p>The studies were strange enough, ranging from the principles of sympathetic magic to the wild fables of lycanthropy and demonology. Yet I was amazingly quick at learning.</p>
    <p>It was as though I took a refresher course, to remind myself of knowledge I had once known by heart. Only one subject really troubled me, and I continually stumbled across it, by roundabout references.</p>
    <p>And that was the Force, the entity, disguised in folklore under such familiar names as the Black Man, Satan, Lucifer, and such unfamiliar names as Kutchie, of the Australian Dieris, Tuna, of the Esquimaux, the African Abonsam, and the Swiss Stratteli.</p>
    <p>I did no research on the Black Man -- but I did not need to. There was a recurrent dream that I could not help identifying with the dark force that represented evil. I would be standing before a golden square of light, very much afraid, and yet straining toward some consummation that I desired. And deep down within that glowing square that would be the beginning of motion. I knew there were certain ritual gestures to be made before the ceremony could be begun, but it was difficult to break the paralysis that held me.</p>
    <p>A square like the moon-drenched window before me -- yet not the same.</p>
    <p>For no chill essence of fear thrust itself out at me now. Rather, the low humming I heard was soothing, gentle as a woman's crooning voice.</p>
    <p>The golden square wavered -- shook -- and little tendrils of crepuscular light fingered out toward me. Ever the low humming came, alluring and disarming.</p>
    <p>Golden fingers -- tentacles -- they darted here and there as if puzzled. They touched lamp, table, carpet, and drew back. They -- touched me.</p>
    <p>Swiftly they leaped forward now -- avid! I had time for a momentary pulse of alarm before they wrapped me in an embrace like golden sands of sleep. The humming grew louder. And I responded to it.</p>
    <p>As the skin of the flayed satyr Marsyas thrilled at the sound of his native Phrygian melodies! I knew this music. I knew this -- chant!</p>
    <p>Stole through the golden glow a crouching shadow -- not human -- with amber eyes and a bristling mane -- the shadow of a wolf.</p>
    <p>It hesitated, glanced over its shoulder questioningly. And now another shape swam into view, cowled and gowned so that nothing of its face or body showed. But it was small -- small as a child.</p>
    <p>Wolf and cowled figure hung in the golden mists, watching and waiting. The sighing murmur altered. Formed itself into syllables and words. Words in no human tongue, but -- I knew them.</p>
    <p>"Ganelon! I call you, Ganelon! By the seal in your blood -- hear me!"</p>
    <p>Ganelon! Surely that was my name. I knew it so well.</p>
    <p>Yet who called me thus?</p>
    <p>"I have called you before, but the way was not open. Now the bridge is made. Come to me, Ganelon!"</p>
    <p>A sigh.</p>
    <p>The wolf glanced over a bristling shoulder, snarling. The cowled figure bent toward me. I sensed keen eyes searching me from the darkness of the hood, and an icy breath touched me.</p>
    <p>"He has forgotten, Medea," said a sweet, high-pitched voice, like the tone of a child.</p>
    <p>Again the sigh. "Has he forgotten me? Ganelon, Ganelon! Have you forgotten the arms of Medea, the lips of Medea?"</p>
    <p>I swung,' cradled in the golden mists, half asleep.</p>
    <p>"He has forgotten," the cowled figure said.</p>
    <p>"Then let him come to me nevertheless. Ganelon! The Need-fire burns. The gateway lies open to the Dark World. By fire and earth, and darkness, I summon you! Ganelon!"</p>
    <p>"He has forgotten."</p>
    <p>"Bring him. We have the power, now."</p>
    <p>The golden sands thickened. Flame-eyed wolf and robed shadow swam toward me. I felt myself lifted -- moving forward, not of my own volition.</p>
    <p>The window swung wide. I saw the sword, sheathed and ready. I snatched up the weapon, but I could not resist that relentless tide that carried me forward. Wolf and whispering shadow drifted with me.</p>
    <p>"To the Fire. Bring him to the Fire."</p>
    <p>"He has forgotten, Medea."</p>
    <p>"To the Fire, Edeyrn. To the Fire."</p>
    <p>Twisted tree-limbs floated past me. Far ahead I saw a flicker. It grew larger, nearer. It was the Need-fire.</p>
    <p>Faster the tide bore me. Toward the fire itself --</p>
    <p>Not to Caer Llyr!</p>
    <p>From the depths of my mind the cryptic words spewed. Amber-eyed wolf whirled to glare at me; cowled shadow swept in closer on the golden stream. I felt a chill of deadly cold drive through the curling mists.</p>
    <p>"Caer Llyr," the cloaked Edeyrn whispered in the child's sweet voice. "He remembers Caer Llyr -- but does he remember Llyr?"</p>
    <p>"He will remember! He has been sealed to Llyr. And, in Caer Llyr, the Place of Llyr, he will remember."</p>
    <p>The Need-fire was a towering pillar a few yards away. I fought against the dragging tide.</p>
    <p>I lifted my sword -- threw the sheath away. I cut at the golden mists that fettered me.</p>
    <p>Under the ancient steel the shining fog-wraiths shuddered and were torn apart -- and drew back. There was a break in the humming harmony; for an instant, utter silence.-</p>
    <p>Then --</p>
    <p>"Matholch!" the invisible whisperer cried. "Lord Matholch!"</p>
    <p>The wolf crouched, fangs bared. I aimed a cut at its snarling mask. It avoided the blow easily and sprang.</p>
    <p>It caught the blade between its teeth and wrenched the hilt from my grip.</p>
    <p>The golden fogs surged back, folding me in their warm embrace.</p>
    <p>"Caer Llyr," they murmured.</p>
    <p>The Need-fire roared up in a scarlet fountain.</p>
    <p>"Caer Llyr!" the flames shouted.</p>
    <p>And out of those fires rose -- a woman!</p>
    <p>Hair dark as midnight fell softly to her knees. Under level brows she flashed one glance at me, a glance that held question and a fierce determination. She was loveliness incarnate. Dark loveliness.</p>
    <p>Lilith. Medea, witch of Colchis!</p>
    <p>And --</p>
    <p>"The gateway closes," the child-voice of Edeym said.</p>
    <p>The wolf, still mouthing my sword, crouched uneasily. But the woman of the fire said no word.</p>
    <p>She held out her arms to me.</p>
    <p>The golden clouds thrust me forward, into those white arms.</p>
    <p>Wolf and cowled shadow sprang to flank us. The humming rose to a deep-pitched roar -- a thunder as of crashing worlds.</p>
    <p>"It is difficult, difficult," Medea said. "Help me, Edeyrn. Lord Matholch."</p>
    <p>The fires died. Around us was not the moonlit wilderness of the Limberlost, but empty grayness, a featureless grayness that stretched to infinity. Not even stars showed against that blank.</p>
    <p>And now there was fear in the voice of Edeyrn.</p>
    <p>"Medea. I have not the -- power. I stayed too long in the Earth-world."</p>
    <p>"Open the gate!" Medea cried. "Thrust it open but a little way, or we stay here between the worlds forever!"</p>
    <p>The wolf crouched, snarling. I felt energy pouring out of his beast-body. His brain that was not the brain of a beast.</p>
    <p>Around us the golden clouds were dissipating.</p>
    <p>The grayness stole in.</p>
    <p>"Ganelon," Medea said. "Ganelon! Help me!"</p>
    <p>A door in my mind opened. A formless darkness stole in.</p>
    <p>I felt that deadly, evil shadow creep through me, and submerge my mind under ebon waves.</p>
    <p>"He has the power," Edeyrn murmured. "He was sealed to Llyr. Let him call on -- Llyr."</p>
    <p>"No. No. I dare not. Llyr?" But Medea's face was turned to me questioningly.</p>
    <p>At my feet the wolf snarled and strained, as though by sheer brute strength it might wrench open a gateway between locked worlds.</p>
    <p>Now the black sea submerged me utterly. My thought reached out and was repulsed by the dark horror of sheer infinity, stretched forth again and --</p>
    <p>Touched -- something!</p>
    <p>Llyr...Llyr!</p>
    <p>"The gateway opens," Edeyrn said.</p>
    <p>The gray emptiness was gone. Golden clouds thinned and vanished. Around me, white pillars rose to a vault far, far above. We stood on a raised dais upon which curious designs were emblazoned.</p>
    <p>The tide of evil which had flowed through me had vanished.</p>
    <p>But, sick with horror and self-loathing, I dropped to my knees, one arm shielding my eyes.</p>
    <p>I had called on -- Llyr!</p>

     <p>III. Locked Worlds</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>ACHING IN every muscle, I woke and lay motionless, staring at the low ceiling. Memory flooded back. I turned my head, realizing that I lay on a soft couch padded with silks and pillows. Across the bare, simply furnished room was a recessed window, translucent, for it admitted light, but I could see only vague blurs through it.</p>
    <p>Seated beside me, on a three-legged stool, was the dwarfed, robed figure I knew was Edeym.</p>
    <p>Not even now could I see the face; the shadows within the cowl were too deep. I felt the keen glint of a watchful gaze, though, and a breath of something unfamiliar -- cold and deadly. The robes were saffron, an ugly hue that held nothing of life in the harsh folds. Staring, I saw that the creature was less than four feet tall, or would have been had it stood upright.</p>
    <p>Again I heard that sweet, childish, sexless voice.</p>
    <p>"Will you drink, Lord Ganelon? Or eat?"</p>
    <p>I threw back the gossamer robe covering me and sat up. I was wearing a thin tunic of silvery softness, and trunks of the same material. Edeyrn apparently had not moved, but a drapery swung apart in the wall, and a man came silently in, bearing a covered tray.</p>
    <p>Sight of him was reassuring. He was a big man, sturdily muscled, and under a plumed Etruscan-styled helmet his face was tanned and strong. I thought so till I met his eyes. They were blue pools in which horror had drowned. And ancient fear, so familiar that it was almost submerged, lay deep in his gaze.</p>
    <p>Silently he served me and in silence withdrew.</p>
    <p>Edeyrn nodded toward the tray.</p>
    <p>"Eat and drink. You will be stronger, Lord Ganelon."</p>
    <p>There were meats and bread, of a sort, and a glass of colorless liquid that was not water, as I found on sampling it. I took a sip, set down the chalice, and scowled at Edeyrn.</p>
    <p>"I gather that I'm not insane," I said.</p>
    <p>"You are not. Your soul has been elsewhere -- you have been in exile -- but you are home again now."</p>
    <p>"In Caer Llyr?" I asked, without quite knowing why.</p>
    <p>Edeyrn shook the saffron robes.</p>
    <p>"No. But you must remember?"</p>
    <p>"I remember nothing. Who are you? What's happened to me?"</p>
    <p>"You know that you are Ganelon?"</p>
    <p>"My name's Edward Bond."</p>
    <p>"Yet you almost remembered -- at the Need-fire," Edeym said. "This will take time. And there is danger always. Who am I? I am Edeyrn -- who serves the Coven."</p>
    <p>"Are you --"</p>
    <p>"A woman," she said, in that childish, sweet voice, laughing a little. "A very old woman, the oldest of the Coven, it has shrunk from its original thirteen. There is Medea, of course, Lord Matholch -- " I remembered the wolf -- "Ghast Rhymi, who has more power than any of us, but is too old to use it. And you, Lord Ganelon, or Edward Bond, as you name yourself. Five of us in all now. Once there were hundreds, but even I cannot remember that time, though Ghast Rhymi can, if he would."</p>
    <p>I put my head in my hands.</p>
    <p>"Good heavens, I don't know! Your words mean nothing to me. I don't even know where I am!"</p>
    <p>"Listen," she said, and I felt a soft touch on my shoulder. "You must understand this. You have lost your memories."</p>
    <p>"That's not true."</p>
    <p>"It is true, Lord Ganelon. Your true memories were erased, and you were given artificial ones. All you think you recall now, of your life on the Earth-world -- all that is false. It did not happen. At least, not to you."</p>
    <p>"The Earth-world? I'm not on Earth?"</p>
    <p>"This is a different world," she said. "But it is your own world. You came from here originally. The Rebels, our enemies, exiled you and changed your memories."</p>
    <p>"That's impossible."</p>
    <p>"Come here," Edeyrn said, and went to the window. She touched something, and the pane grew transparent. I looked over her shrouded head at a landscape I have never seen before.</p>
    <p>Or had I?</p>
    <p>Under a dull, crimson sun the rolling forest below lay bathed in bloody light. I was looking down from a considerable height, and could not make out details, but it seemed to me that the trees were oddly shaped and that they were moving. A river ran toward distant hills. A few white towers rose from the forest. That was all. Yet the scarlet, huge sun had told me enough. This was not the Earth I knew.</p>
    <p>"Another planet?"</p>
    <p>"More than that," she said. "Few in the Dark World know this. But I know -- and there are some others who have learned, unluckily for you. There are worlds of probability, divergent in the stream of time, but identical almost, until the branches diverge too far."</p>
    <p>"I don't understand that."</p>
    <p>"Worlds coexistent in time and space -- but separated by another dimension, the variant of probability. This is the world that might have been yours had something not happened, long ago. Originally the Dark World and the Earth-world were one, in space and time. Then a decision was made -- a very vital decision, though I am not sure what it was. From that point the time-stream branched, and two variant worlds existed where there had been only one before.</p>
    <p>"They were utterly identical at first, except that in one of them the key decision had not been made. The results were very different. It happened hundreds of years ago, but the two variant worlds are still close together in the time stream. Eventually they will drift farther apart, and grow less like each other. Meanwhile, they are similar, so much so that a man on the Earth-world may have his twin in the Dark World."</p>
    <p>"His twin?"</p>
    <p>"The man he might have been, had the key decision not been made ages ago in his world. Yes, twins, Ganelon -- Edward Bond. Do you understand now?"</p>
    <p>I returned to the couch and sat there, frowning.</p>
    <p>'Two worlds, coexistent. I can understand that, yes. But I think you mean more -- that a double for me exists somewhere."</p>
    <p>"You were born in the Dark World. Your double, the true Edward Bond, was born on Earth. But we have enemies here, woods-runners, rebels, and they have stolen enough knowledge to bridge the gulf between time-variants. We ourselves learned the method only lately, though once it was well-known here, among the Coven.</p>
    <p>"The rebels reached out across the gulf and sent you -- sent Ganelon -- into the Earth-world so that Edward Bond could come here, among them. They --"</p>
    <p>"But why?" I interrupted. "What reason could they have for that?"</p>
    <p>Edeyrn turned her hooded head toward me, and I felt, not for the first time, remote chill as she fixed her unseen gaze upon my face.</p>
    <p>"What reason?" she echoed in her sweet, cool voice. "Think, Ganelon. See if you remember."</p>
    <p>I thought, I closed my eyes and tried to submerge my conscious mind, to let the memories of Ganelon rise up to the surface if they were there at all. I could not yet accept this preposterous thought in its entirety, but certainly it would explain a great deal if it were true. It would even explain -- I realized suddenly -- that strange blanking out in the plane over the Sumatra jungle, that moment from which everything had seemed so wrong.</p>
    <p>Perhaps that was the moment when Edward Bond left Earth, and Ganelon took his place -- both twins too stunned and helpless at the change to know what had happened, or to understand.</p>
    <p>But this was impossible!</p>
    <p>"I don't remember!" I said harshly. "It can't have happened. I know who I am! I know everything that ever happened to Edward Bond. You can't tell me that all this is only illusion. It's too clear, too real!"</p>
    <p>"Ganelon, Ganelon," Edeyrn crooned to me, a smile in her voice. "Think of the rebel tribes. Try, Ganelon. Try to remember why they did what they did to you. The woods-runners, Ganelon -- the disobedient little men in green. The hateful men who threatened us. Ganelon, surely you remember!"</p>
    <p>It may have been a form of hypnotism. I thought of that later. But at that moment, a picture did swim into my mind. I could see the green-clad swarms moving through the woods, and the sight of them made me hot with sudden anger. For that instant I was Ganelon, and a great and powerful lord, defied by these underlings not fit to tie my shoe.</p>
    <p>"Of course you hated them," murmured Edeyrn. She may have seen the look on my face. I felt the stiffness of an unfamiliar twist of feature as she spoke. I had straightened where I sat, and my shoulders had gone back arrogantly, my lip curling a feeling of scorn. So perhaps she did not read my mind at all. What I thought was plain in my face and bearing.</p>
    <p>"Of course you punished them when you could," she went on. "It was your right and duty. But they duped you, Ganelon. They were cleverer than you. They found a door that would turn on a temporal axis and thrust you into another world. On the far side of the door was Edward Bond who did not hate them. So they opened the door."</p>
    <p>Edeyrn's voice rose slightly and in it I detected a note of mockery.</p>
    <p>"False memories, false memories, Ganelon. You put on Edward Bond's past when you put on his identity. But he came into our world as he was, free of any knowledge of Ganelon. He has given us much trouble, my friend, and much bewilderment. At first we did not guess what had gone wrong. It seemed to us that as Ganelon vanished from our Coven, a strange new Ganelon appeared among the rebels, organizing them to fight against his own people." She laughed softly. "We had to rouse Ghast Rhymi from his sleep to aid us. But in the end, learning the method of door-opening, we came to Earth and searched for you, and found you. And brought you back. This is your world, Lord Ganelon! Will you accept it?"</p>
    <p>I shook my head dizzily.</p>
    <p>"It isn't real. I'm still Edward Bond."</p>
    <p>"We can bring back your true memories. And we will. They came to the surface for a moment, I think, just now. But it will take time. Meanwhile, you are one of the Coven, and Edward Bond is back upon Earth in his old place. Remembering -- " She laughed softly. "Remembering, I am sure, all he left undone here. But helpless to return, or meddle again in what does not concern him. But we have needed you, Ganelon. How badly we have needed you!"</p>
    <p>"What can I do? I'm Edward Bond."</p>
    <p>"Ganelon can do much -- when he remembers. The Coven has fallen upon evil days. Once we were thirteen. Once there were other Covens to join us in our Sabbats. Once we ruled this whole world, under Great Llyr. But Llyr is falling asleep now. He draws farther and farther away from his worshippers. By degrees the Dark World has fallen into savagery. And, of all the Covens, only we remain, a broken circle, dwelling close to Caer Llyr where the Great One sleeps beyond his Golden Window."</p>
    <p>She fell silent for a moment.</p>
    <p>"Sometimes I think that Llyr does not sleep at all," she said. "I think he is withdrawing, little by little, into some farther world, losing his interest in us whom he created. But he returns!" She laughed. "Yes, he returns when the sacrifices stand before his Window. And so long as he comes back, the Coven has power to force its will upon the Dark World.</p>
    <p>"But day by day the forest rebels grow stronger, Ganelon. With our help, you were gathering power to oppose them -- when you vanished. We needed you then, and we need you more man ever now. You are one of the Coven, perhaps the greatest of us all. With Matholch you were --"</p>
    <p>"Wait a minute," I said. "I'm still confused. Matholch? Was he the wolf I saw?"</p>
    <p>"He was."</p>
    <p>"You spoke of him as though he were a man."</p>
    <p>"He is a man -- at times. He is lycanthropic. A shape-changer."</p>
    <p>"A werewolf? That's impossible. It's a myth, a bit of crazy folklore."</p>
    <p>"What started the myth?" Edeyrn asked. "Long ago, there were many gateways opened between the Dark World and Earth. On Earth, memories of those days survive as superstitious tales. Folklore. But with roots in reality."</p>
    <p>"It's superstition, nothing else," I said flatly. "You actually mean that werewolves, vampires and all that, exist."</p>
    <p>"Ghast Rhymi could tell you more of this than I can. But we cannot wake him for such a matter. Perhaps I -- well, listen. The body is composed of cells. These are adaptable to some extent. When they are made even more adaptable, when metabolism is accelerated sporadically, werewolves come into being."</p>
    <p>The sweet, sexless child's voice spoke on from the shadow of the hood. I began to understand a little. On Earth, college biology had showed me instances of cells run wild -- malignant tumors and the like. And there were many cases of "wolf-men," with thick hair growing like a pelt over them. If the cells could adapt themselves quickly, strange things might occur.</p>
    <p>But the bones? Specialized osseous tissue, not the rigidly brittle bones of the normal man. A physiological structure that could, theoretically, so alter itself that it would be wolf instead of man, was an astounding theory!</p>
    <p>"Part of it is illusion, of course," Edeyrn said. "Matholch is not as bestial in form as he seems. Yet he is a shape-changer, and his form does alter."</p>
    <p>"But how?" I asked. "How did he get this power?"</p>
    <p>For the first time Edeyrn seemed to hesitate. "He is -- a mutation. There are many mutations among us, here in the Dark World. Some are in the Coven, but others are elsewhere."</p>
    <p>"Are you a mutation?" I asked her.</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>"A -- shape-changer?"</p>
    <p>"No," Edeyrn said, and the thin body under the robe seemed to shake a little. "No, I cannot change my shape, Lord Ganelon. You do not remember my -- my powers?"</p>
    <p>"I do not."</p>
    <p>"Yet you may find me useful when the Rebels strike again," she said slowly. "Yes, there are mutations among us, and perhaps that is the chief reason why the probability-rift came ages ago. There are no mutants on Earth -- at least not our type. Matholch is not the only one."</p>
    <p>"Am I a mutant?" I asked very softly.</p>
    <p>The cowled head shook.</p>
    <p>"No. For no mutant may be sealed to Llyr. As you have been sealed. One of the Coven must know the key to Caer Llyr."</p>
    <p>The cold breath of fear touched me again. No, not fear. Horror, the deadly, monstrous breathlessness that always took me when the name of Llyr was mentioned.</p>
    <p>I forced myself to say, "Who is Llyr?"</p>
    <p>There was a long silence.</p>
    <p>"Who speaks of Llyr?" a deep voice behind me asked. "Better not to lift that veil, Edeyrn!"</p>
    <p>"Yet it may be necessary," Edeyrn said.</p>
    <p>I turned, and saw, framed against the dark portiere, the rangy, whipcord figure of a man, clad as I was in tunic and trunks. His red, pointed beard jutted; the half-snarling curve of his full lips reminded me of something. Agile grace was in every line of his wiry body.</p>
    <p>Yellow eyes watched me with wry amusement.</p>
    <p>"Pray it may not be necessary," the man said. "Well, Lord Ganelon? Have you forgotten me, too?"</p>
    <p>"He has forgotten you, Matholch," Edeyrn said, "At least in this form!"</p>
    <p>Matholch -- the wolf! The shape-changer!</p>
    <p>He grinned.</p>
    <p>"It is Sabbat tonight," he said. "The Lord Ganelon must be prepared for it. Also, I think there will be trouble. However, that is Medea's business, and she asks if Ganelon is awake. Since he is, let us see her now."</p>
    <p>"Will you go with Matholch?" Edeyrn asked me.</p>
    <p>"I suppose so," I said. The red-beard grinned again.</p>
    <p>"Ai, you have forgotten, Ganelon! In the old days you'd never have trusted me behind your back with a dagger."</p>
    <p>"You always knew better than to strike," Edeyrn said. "If Ganelon ever called on Llyr, it would be unfortunate for you!"</p>
    <p>"Well, I joked," Matholch said carelessly. "My enemies must be strong enough to give me a fight so I'll wait till your memory comes back, Lord Ganelon. Meanwhile the Coven has its back to the wall, and I need you as badly as you need me. Will you come?"</p>
    <p>"Go with him," Edeyrn said. "You are in no danger -- wolf's bark is worse than wolf's bite -- even though this is not Caer Llyr."</p>
    <p>I thought I sensed a hidden threat in her words. Matholch shrugged and held the curtain aside to let me pass.</p>
    <p>"Few dare to threaten a shape-changer," he said over his shoulder.</p>
    <p>"I dare," Edeyrn said, from the enigmatic shadows of her saffron cowl. And I remembered that she was a mutant too -- though not a lycanthrope, like a red-bearded werewolf striding beside me along the vaulted passage.</p>
    <p>What was -- Edeyrn?</p>

     <p>IV. Matholch -- and Medea</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>UP TO now the true wonder of the situation had not really touched me yet. The anaesthesia of shock had dulled me. As a soldier -- caught in the white light of a flare dropped from an overhead plane -- freezes into immobility, so my mind still remained passive. Only superficial thoughts were moving there, as though, by concentration on immediate needs, I could eliminate the incredible fact that I was not on the familiar, solid ground of Earth.</p>
    <p>But it was more than this. There was a curious, indefinable familiarity about these groined, pale-walled halls through which I strode beside Matholch, as there had been a queer familiarity about the twilit landscape stretching to forested distance beneath the window of my room.</p>
    <p>Edeyrn -- Medea -- the Coven.</p>
    <p>The names had significance, like words in a language I had once known well, but had forgotten.</p>
    <p>The half-loping, swift walk of Matholch, the easy swing of his muscular shoulders, the snarling smile on his red-bearded lips -- these were not new to me.</p>
    <p>He watched me furtively out of his yellow eyes. Once we paused before a red-figured drapery, and Matholch, hesitating, thrust the curtain aside and gestured me forward.</p>
    <p>I took one step -- and stopped. I looked at him.</p>
    <p>He nodded as though satisfied. Yet there was still a question in his face.</p>
    <p>"So you remember a little, eh? Enough to know that this isn't the way to Medea. However, come along, for a moment. I want to talk to you."</p>
    <p>As I followed him up a winding stair, I suddenly realized that he had not spoken in English. But I had understood him, as I had understood Edeyrn and Medea.</p>
    <p>Ganelon?</p>
    <p>We were in a tower room, walled with transparent panes. There was a smoky, sour odor in the air, and gray tendrils coiled up from a brazier set in a tripod in the middle of the chamber. Matholch gestured me to one of the couches by the windows. He dropped carelessly beside me.</p>
    <p>"I wonder how much you remember," he said.</p>
    <p>I shook my head.</p>
    <p>"Not much. Enough not to be too -- trusting."</p>
    <p>"The artificial Earth-memories are still strong, then. Ghast Rhymi said you would remember eventually, but that it would take time. The false writing on the slate of your mind will fade, and the old, true memories will come back. After a while."</p>
    <p>Like a palimpsest, I thought -- manuscript with two writings upon its parchment. But Ganelon was still a stranger; I was still Edward Bond.</p>
    <p>"I wonder," Matholch said slowly, staring at me. "You spent much time exiled. I wonder if you have changed, basically. Always before -- you hated me, Ganelon. Do you hate me now?"</p>
    <p>"No," I said. "At least, I don't know. I think I distrust you."</p>
    <p>"You have reason. If you remember at all. We have always been enemies, Ganelon, though bound together by the needs and laws of the Coven. I wonder if we need be enemies any longer?"</p>
    <p>"It depends. I'm not anxious to make enemies -- especially here."</p>
    <p>Matholch's red brows drew together.</p>
    <p>"Aye, that is not Ganelon speaking! In the old days, you cared nothing about how many enemies you made. If you have changed so much, danger to us all may result."</p>
    <p>"My memory is gone," I said. "I don't understand much of this. It seems dream-like."</p>
    <p>Now he sprang up and restlessly paced the room. "That's well. If you become the old Ganelon again, we'll be enemies again. That I know. But if Earth-exile has changed you -- altered you -- we may be friends. It would be better to be friends. Medea would not like it; I do not think Edeyrn would. As for Ghast Rhymi -- " He shrugged. "Ghast Rhymi is old -- old. In all the Dark World, Ganelon, you have the most power. Or can have. But it would mean going to Caer Llyr."</p>
    <p>Matholch stooped to look into my eyes.</p>
    <p>"In the old days, you knew what that meant. You were afraid, but you wanted the power. Once you went to Caer Llyr -- to be sealed. So there is a bond between you and Llyr -- not consummated yet. But it can be, if you wish it."</p>
    <p>"What is Llyr?" I asked.</p>
    <p>"Pray that you will not remember that," Matholch said. "When Medea talks to you -- beware when she speaks of Llyr. I may be friend of yours or enemy, Ganelon, but for my own sake, for the sake of the Dark World -- even for the sake of the rebels -- I warn you: do not go to Caer Llyr. No matter what Medea asks. Or promises. At least be wary till you have your memories back."</p>
    <p>"What is Llyr?" I said again.</p>
    <p>Matholch swung around, his back to me. "Ghast Rhymi knows, I think. I do not. Nor do I want to. Llyr is -- is evil -- and is hungry, always. But what feeds his appetite is -- is -- " He stopped.</p>
    <p>"You have forgotten," he went on after a while. "One thing I wonder. Have you forgotten how to summon Llyr?"</p>
    <p>I did not answer. There was a darkness in my mind, an ebon gate against which my questioning thoughts probed vainly. Llyr -- Llyr?</p>
    <p>Matholch cast a handful of powdery substance into the glowing brazier.</p>
    <p>"Can you summon Llyr?" he asked again his voice soft. "Answer, Ganelon. Can you?"</p>
    <p>The sour smoke-stench grew stronger. The darkness in my head sprang apart, riven, as though a gateway had opened in the shadow. I -- recognized that deadly perfume.</p>
    <p>I stood up, glaring at Matholch. I took two steps, thrust out my sandaled foot, and overturned the brazier. Embers scattered on the stone floor. The red-beard turned a startled face to me.</p>
    <p>I reached out, gripped Matholch's tunic, and shook him till his teeth rattled together. Hot fury filled me -- and something more.</p>
    <p>That Matholch should try his tricks on me!</p>
    <p>A stranger had my tongue. I heard myself speaking.</p>
    <p>"Save your spells for the slaves and helots," I snarled. "I tell you what I wish to tell you -- no more than that! Burn your filthy herbs elsewhere, not in my presence!"</p>
    <p>Red-bearded jaw jutted. Yellow eyes flamed. Matholch's face altered, flesh flowing like water, dimly seen in the smoke-clouds that poured up from the scattered embers.</p>
    <p>Yellow tusks threatened me through the gray mists.</p>
    <p>The shape-changer made a wordless noise in his throat -- the guttural sound a beast might make. Wolf-cry! A wolf mask glared into mine!</p>
    <p>The smoke swam away. The illusion -- illusion? -- was gone. Matholch, his face relaxing from its snarling lines, pulled gently free from my grip.</p>
    <p>"You -- startled me, Lord Ganelon," he said smoothly. "But I think that I have had a question answered, whether or not these herbs -- " He nodded toward the overturned brazier. " -- had anything to do with it."</p>
    <p>I turned toward the doorway.</p>
    <p>"Wait," Matholch said. "I took something from you, a while ago."</p>
    <p>I stopped.</p>
    <p>The red-beard came toward me, holding out a weapon -- a bared sword.</p>
    <p>"I took this from you when we passed through the Need-fire," he said. "It is yours."</p>
    <p>I accepted the blade.</p>
    <p>Again I moved toward the curtained archway.</p>
    <p>Behind me Matholch spoke.</p>
    <p>"We are not enemies yet, Ganelon," he said gently. "And if you are wise, you will not forget my warning. Do not go to Caer Llyr."</p>
    <p>I went out. Holding the sword, I hurried down the winding stairway. My feet found their path without conscious guidance. The -- intruder -- in my brain was still strong. A palimpsest. And the blurred, erased writing was becoming visible, as though treated with some strong chemical.</p>
    <p>The writing that was my lost memory.</p>
    <p>The castle -- how did I know it was a castle? -- was a labyrinth. Twice I passed silent soldiers standing guard, with a familiar shadow of fear in their eyes -- a shadow that, I thought, deepened as they saw me.</p>
    <p>I went on, hurrying along a pale-amber hallway. I brushed aside a golden curtain and stepped into an oval room, dome-ceilinged, walled with pale, silken draperies. A fountain spurted, its spray cool on my cheek. Across the chamber, an archway showed the outlines of leafy branches beyond.</p>
    <p>I went on through the arch. I stepped out into a walled garden. A garden of exotic flowers and bizarre trees.</p>
    <p>The blooms were a riot of patternless color, like glowing jewels against the dark earth. Ruby and amethyst, crystal-clear and milky white, silver and gold and emerald, the flowers made a motionless carpet. But the trees were not motionless.</p>
    <p>Twisted and gnarled as oaks, their black boles and branches were veiled by a luxuriant cloud of leafage, virulent green.</p>
    <p>A stir of movement rippled through that green curtain. The trees roused to awareness.</p>
    <p>I saw the black branches twist and writhe slowly --</p>
    <p>Satisfied, their vigilance relaxed. They were motionless again. They -- knew me.</p>
    <p>Beyond that evil orchard the dark sky made the glowing ember of the sun more brilliant by contrast.</p>
    <p>The trees stirred again.</p>
    <p>Ripples of unrest shook the green. A serpentine limb, training a veil of leaves, lashed out -- struck -- whipped back into place.</p>
    <p>Where it had been a darting shape ran forward, ducking and twisting -- as the guardian trees struck savagely at it.</p>
    <p>A man, in a tight-fitting suit of earth-brown and forest-green, came running toward me, his feet trampling the jewel-flowers. His hard, reckless face was alight with excitement and a kind of triumph. He was empty-handed, but a pistol-like weapon of some sort swung at his belt.</p>
    <p>"Edward!" he said urgently, yet keeping his voice low. "Edward Bond!"</p>
    <p>I knew him. Or I knew him for what he was. I had seen dodging, furtive, green-clad figures like his before, and an anger already familiar surged over me at the very sight of him.</p>
    <p>Enemy, upstart! One of the many who had dared work their magic upon the great Lord Ganelon.</p>
    <p>I felt the heat of rage suffuse my face, and the blood rang in my ears with this unfamiliar, yet well-known fury. My body stiffened in the posture of Ganelon -- shoulders back, lip curled, chin high. I heard myself curse the fellow in a voice that was choked and a language I scarcely remembered. And I saw him draw back, disbelief vivid upon his face. His hand dropped to his belt.</p>
    <p>"Ganelon?" he faltered, his eyes narrow as they searched mine. "Edward, are you with us or are you Ganelon again?"</p>

     <p>V. Scarlet Witch</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>GRIPPED in my right hand I still held the sword. I cut at him savagely by way of answer. He sprang back, glanced at me over his shoulder, and drew his weapon. I followed his glance and saw another green figure dodging forward among the trees. It was smaller and slenderer -- a girl, in a tunic the color of earth and forest. Her black hair swung upon her shoulders. She was tugging at her belt as she ran, and the face she turned to me was ugly with hate, her teeth showing in a snarl.</p>
    <p>The man before me was saying something.</p>
    <p>"Edward, listen to me!" he was crying. "Even if you're Ganelon, you remember Edward Bond! He was with us -- he believed in us. Give us a hearing before it's too late! Aries could convince you, Edward! Come to Aries. Even if you're Ganelon, let me take you to Aries!"</p>
    <p>"It's no use, Ertu," the voice of the girl cried thinly. She was struggling with the last of the trees, whose flexible bough-tips still clutched to stop her. Neither of them tried now to keep their voices down. They were shouting, and I knew they must rouse the guards at any moment, and I wanted to kill them both myself before anyone came to forestall me by accident. I was hungry and thirsty for the blood of these enemies, and in that moment the name of Edward Bond was not even a memory.</p>
    <p>"Kill him, Ertu!" cried the girl. "Kill him or stand out of the way! I know Ganelon!"</p>
    <p>I looked at her and took a fresh grip on my sword. Yes, she spoke the truth. She knew Ganelon. And Ganelon knew her, and remembered dimly that she had reason for her hate. I had seen that face before, contorted with fury and despair. I could not recall when or where or why, but she looked familiar.</p>
    <p>The man Ertu drew his weapon reluctantly. To him I was still at least the image of a friend. I laughed exultantly and swung at him again with the sword, hearing it hiss viciously through the air. This time I drew blood. He stepped back again, lifting his weapon so that I looked down its black barrel.</p>
    <p>"Don't make me do it," he said between his teeth. "This will pass. You have been Edward Bond -- you will be again. Don't make me kill you, Ganelon!"</p>
    <p>I lifted the sword, seeing him only dimly through a ruddy haze of anger. There was a great exultation in me. I could already see the fountain of blood that would leap from his severed arteries when my blade completed its swing.</p>
    <p>I braced my body for the great full-armed blow!</p>
    <p>And the sword came alive in my hand. It leaped and shuddered against my fist.</p>
    <p>Impossibly -- in a way I cannot describe -- that blow reversed itself. All the energy I was braced to expend upon my enemy recoiled up the sword, up my arm, crashed against my own body. A violent explosion of pain and shock sent the garden reeling. The earth stuck hard against my knees.</p>
    <p>Mist cleared from my eyes. I was still Ganelon, but a Ganelon dizzy from something more powerful than a blow.</p>
    <p>I was kneeling on the grass, braced with one hand, shaking the throbbing fingers of my sword-hand and staring at the sword that lay a dozen feet away, still faintly glowing.</p>
    <p>It was Matholch's doing -- I knew that! I should have remembered how little I could trust that shifting, unstable wolf-ling. I had laid hands upon him in his tower-room -- I should have known he would have his revenge for that. Even Edward Bond -- soft fool that he was -- would have been wise enough not to accept a gift from the shape-changer.</p>
    <p>There was no time now for anger at Matholch, though. I was looking up into Ertu's eyes, and into the muzzle of his weapon, and a look of decision grew slowly in his face as he scanned mine.</p>
    <p>"Ganelon!" he said, almost whispering. "Warlock!"</p>
    <p>He tilted the weapon down at me, his finger moving on the trigger.</p>
    <p>"Wait, Ertu!" cried a thin voice behind him. "Wait -- let me!"</p>
    <p>I looked up, still dazed. It had all happened so quickly that the girl was still struggling in the edge of the trees, though she cleared them as I looked and lifted her own weapon. Behind it her face was white and blazing with relentless hate. "Let me!" she cried again. "He owes me this!"</p>
    <p>I was helpless. I knew that even at this distance she would not miss. I saw the glare of fury in her eyes and I saw the muzzle waver a little as her hand shook with rage, but I knew she would not miss me. I thought of a great many things in that instant -- confused memories of Ganelon's and of Edward Bond's surged together through my mind.</p>
    <p>Then a great hissing like a wind swept up among the trees behind the girl. They all swayed toward her more swiftly than trees have any right to move, stooping and straining and hissing with a dreadful vicious avidity. Ertu shouted something inarticulate. But I think the girl was too angry to hear or see.</p>
    <p>She never knew what happened. She could only have felt the great bone-cracking sweep of the nearest branch, reaching out for her from the leaning tree. She fired as the blow struck her, and a white-hot bolt ploughed up the turf at my knee, I could smell the charring grass.</p>
    <p>The girl screamed thinly once as the avid boughs writhed together over her. The limbs threshed about her in a furious welter, and I heard one clear and distinct snap -- a sound I had heard before, I knew, in this garden. The human spine is no more than a twig in the grip of those mighty boughs.</p>
    <p>Ertu was stunned for one brief instant. Then he whirled to me, and this time I knew his finger would not hesitate on the trigger.</p>
    <p>But time had run out for the two woods-people. He was not fully turned when there came a laugh, cool and amused, from behind me. I saw loathing and hatred flash across Ertu's bronzed face, and the weapon whirled away from me and pointed toward someone at my back. But before he could press the trigger something like an arrow of white light sprang over my shoulder and struck him above the heart.</p>
    <p>He dropped instantly, his mouth frozen in a snarling square, his eyes staring.</p>
    <p>I turned, getting slowly to my feet. Medea stood there smiling, very slim and lovely in a close-fitting scarlet gown. In her hand was a small black rod, still raised. Her purple eyes met mine.</p>
    <p>"Ganelon," she murmured in an infinitely caressing voice. "Ganelon." And still holding my gaze with hers, she clapped her hands softly.</p>
    <p>Silent, swift-moving guardsmen came and lifted the motionless body of Ertu. They carried him away. The trees stirred, whispered -- and fell silent.</p>
    <p>"You have remembered," Medea said. "Ganelon is ours again. Do you remember me -- Lord Ganelon?"</p>
    <p>Medea, witch of Colchis! Black and white and crimson, she stood there smiling at me, her strange loveliness stirring old, forgotten memories in my blood. No man who had known Medea could ever forget her wholly. Not till time ended.</p>
    <p>But wait! There was something more about Medea that I must remember. Something that made even Ganelon a little doubtful, a little cautious. Ganelon? Was I Ganelon again? I had been wholly my old self when the woods-people stood before me, but now I was uncertain.</p>
    <p>The memories ebbed. While the lovely witch stood smiling at me, not guessing, all that had made me so briefly Ganelon dropped from my mind and body like a discarded cloak. Edward Bond stood there in my clothing, staring about the clearing and remembering with dismay and sick revulsion what had just been happening here.</p>
    <p>For a moment I turned away to hide from Medea what my face must betray if she saw it. I felt dizzy with more than memory. The knowledge that two identities shared my body was a thought even more disturbing than the memory of what I had just done in the grip of Ganelon's strong, evil will.</p>
    <p>This was Ganelon's body. There could be no doubt of it now. Somewhere on Earth Edward Bond was back in his old place, but the patterns of his memory still overlaid my mind, so that he and I shared a common soul, and there was no Ganelon except briefly, in snatches, as the memories that were rightfully mine -- mine? -- returned to crowd out Edward Bond.</p>
    <p>I hated Ganelon. I rejected all he thought and was. My false memories, the heritage from Edward Bond, were stronger in me than Ganelon. I was Edward Bond -- now!</p>
    <p>Medea's caressing voice broke in upon my conflict, echoing her question.</p>
    <p>"Do you remember me, Lord Ganelon?"</p>
    <p>I turned to her, feeling the bewilderment on my own face, so that my very thoughts were blurred.</p>
    <p>"My name is Bond," I told her stubbornly.</p>
    <p>She sighed.</p>
    <p>"You will come back," she said. "It will take time, but Ganelon will return to us. As you see familiar things again, the life of the Dark World, the life of the Coven, the doors of your mind will open once more. You will remember a little more tonight, I think, at the Sabbat." Her red smile was suddenly almost frightening.</p>
    <p>"Not since I went into the Earth-world has a Sabbat been held, and it is long past time," she went on. "For in Caer Llyr there is one who stirs and grows hungry for his sacrifice."</p>
    <p>She looked at me piercingly, the purple eyes narrowing.</p>
    <p>"Do you remember Caer Llyr, Ganelon?"</p>
    <p>The old sickness and horror came over me as she repeated that cryptic name.</p>
    <p>Llyr -- Llyr! Darkness, and something stirring beyond a golden window. Something too alien to touch the soil that human feet touched, something that should never share the same life humans lived. Touching that soil, sharing that life, it defiled them so that they were no longer fit for humans to share. And yet, despite my revulsion, Llyr was terribly intimate, too!</p>
    <p>I knew, I remembered --</p>
    <p>"I remember nothing," I told her shortly. For in that particular moment, caution was born in me. I could not trust anyone, not even myself. Least of all Ganelon -- myself. I did remember, but I must not let them know. Until I was clearer as to what they wanted, what they threatened, I must keep this one secret which was all the weapon I had.</p>
    <p>Llyr! The thought of him -- of it -- crystallized that decision in my mind. For somewhere in the murk of Ganelon's past there was a frightening link with Llyr. I knew they were trying to push me into that abyss of oneness with Llyr, and I sensed that even Ganelon feared that. I must pretend to be more ignorant than I really was until the thing grew clearer in my memory.</p>
    <p>I shook my head again. "I remembered nothing." â¢</p>
    <p>"Not even Medea?" she whispered, and swayed toward me. There was-sorcery about her. My arms received that red and white softness as if they were Ganelon's arms, not mine. But it was Edward Bond's lips which responded to the fierce pressure of her lips.</p>
    <p>Not even Medea?</p>
    <p>Edward Bond or Ganelon, what was it to me then? The moment was enough.</p>
    <p>But the touch of the red witch wrought a change in Edward Bond. It brought a sense of strangeness, of utter strangeness, to him -- to me. I held her lovely, yielding body in my arms, but something alien and unknown stooped and hovered above me as we touched. I surmised that she was holding herself in check -- restraining a -- a demon that possessed her -- a demon that fought to free itself.</p>
    <p>"Ganelon!"</p>
    <p>Trembling, she pressed her palms against my chest and thrust free. Tiny droplets stood on her pale forehead.</p>
    <p>"Enough!" she whispered. "You know!"</p>
    <p>"What, Medea?"</p>
    <p>And now stark horror stood in those purple eyes.</p>
    <p>"You have forgotten!" she said. "You have forgotten me, forgotten who I am, what I am!"</p>

     <p>VI. The Ride to Caer Secaire</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>LATER, in the apartments that had been Ganelon's, I waited for the hour of Sabbat. And as I waited, I paced the floor restlessly. Ganelon's feet, pacing Ganelon's floor. But the man who walked here was Edward Bond. Amazing, I thought, how the false memory-patterns of another person, impressed upon Ganelon's clean-sponged brain, had changed him from himself to -- me.</p>
    <p>I wondered if I would ever be sure again which personality was myself. I hated and distrusted Ganelon, now. But I knew how easily the old self slipped back, in which I would despise Edward Bond.</p>
    <p>And yet to save myself, I must call back Ganelon's memories. I must know more than those around me guessed I knew, or I thought Ganelon and Bond together might be lost. Medea would tell me nothing. Edeyrn would tell me nothing. Matholch might tell me much, but he would be lying.</p>
    <p>I scarcely dared go with them to this Sabbat, which I thought would be the Sabbat of Llyr, because of that strange and terrible link between Llyr and myself. There would be sacrifices.</p>
    <p>How could I be sure I, myself, was not destined for the altar before that -- that golden window?</p>
    <p>Then, for a brief but timeless moment Ganelon came back, remembering fragmentary things that flitted through my mind too swiftly to take shape. I caught only terror -- terror and revulsion and a hideous, hopeless longing....</p>
    <p>Dared I attend the Sabbat?</p>
    <p>But I dared not fail to attend, for if I refused I must admit I knew more about what threatened Ganelon than Edward Bond should know. And my only frail weapon against them now was what little I recalled that was secret from them. I must go. Even if the altar waited me, I must go.</p>
    <p>There were the woodspeople. They were outlaws, hunted through the. forests by Coven soldiers. Capture meant enslavement -- I remembered the look of still horror in the eyes of those living dead men who were Medea's servants. As Edward Bond, I pitied them, wondered if I could do anything to save them from the Coven. The real Edward Bond had been living among them for a year and a half, organizing resistance, fighting the Coven. On Earth, I knew, he must be raging helplessly now, haunted by the knowledge of work unfinished and friends abandoned to the mercies of dark magic.</p>
    <p>Perhaps I should seek the woodspeople out. Among them, at least, I would be safe while my memories returned. But when they returned -- why, men Ganelon would rage, running amuck among them, mad with his own fury and arrogance. Dared I subject the woodspeople to the danger that would be the Lord Ganelon when Ganelon's memories came back? Dared I subject myself to their vengeance, for they would be many against one?</p>
    <p>I could not go and I could not stay. There was safety nowhere for the Edward Bond who might become Ganelon at any moment. There was danger everywhere. From the rebel woods-people, from every member of this Coven.</p>
    <p>It might come through the wild and mocking Matholch.</p>
    <p>Or through Edeyrn, who had watched me unseen with her chilling gaze in the shadows of her cowl.</p>
    <p>Through Ghast Rhymi, whoever he was. Through Aries, or through the red witch!</p>
    <p>Yes, most of all, I thought, through Medea -- Medea, whom I loved!</p>
    <p>At dusk, two maidens -- helot-servants -- came, bringing food and a change of garments. I ate hurriedly, dressed in the plain, fine-textured tunic and shorts, and drew about me the royal blue cloak they had carried. A mask of golden cloth I dangled undecidedly, until one of the maidens spoke:</p>
    <p>"We are to guide you when you are ready, Lord," she reminded me.</p>
    <p>"I'm ready now," I said, and followed the pair.</p>
    <p>A pale, concealed lighting system of some sort made the hallways bright. I was taken to Medea's apartment, with its singing fountain under the high dome. The red witch was there breathtakingly lovely in a clinging robe of pure white. Above the robe her naked shoulders gleamed smoothly. She wore a scarlet cloak. I wore a blue one.</p>
    <p>The helots slipped away. Medea smiled at me, but I noticed a wire-taut tenseness about her, betrayingly visible at the corners of her lips and in her eyes. A pulse of expectation seemed to beat out from her.</p>
    <p>"Are you ready, Ganelon?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know," I said. "It depends, I suppose. Don't forget that my memory's gone."</p>
    <p>"It may return tonight, some of it anyway," she said.</p>
    <p>"But you will take no part in the ritual, at least until after the sacrifice. It will be better if you merely watch. Since you do not remember the rites, you'd best leave those to the rest of the Coven."</p>
    <p>"Matholch?"</p>
    <p>"And Edeyrn," Medea said. "Ghast Rhymi will not come. He never leaves this castle, nor will he unless the need is very great. He is old, too-old."</p>
    <p>I frowned at the red witch. "Where are we going?" I asked.</p>
    <p>"To Caer Secaire. I told you there had been no sacrifice since I went to Earth-world to search for you. It is past time."</p>
    <p>"What am I supposed to do?"</p>
    <p>She put out a slender hand and touched mine.</p>
    <p>"Nothing, till the moment comes. You will know then. But meantime you must watch -- no more than that. Put on your mask now."</p>
    <p>She slipped on a small black mask that left the lower half of her face visible.</p>
    <p>I donned the golden mask. I followed Medea to a curtained archway, and through it.</p>
    <p>We were in a courtyard. Two horses stood waiting, held by grooms. Medea mounted one and I the other.</p>
    <p>Overhead the sky had darkened. A huge door lifted in the wall. Beyond, a roadway stretched toward the distant forest.</p>
    <p>The somber, angry disc of the red sun, swollen and burning with a dull fire, touched the crest of the mountain barrier.</p>
    <p>Swiftly it sank. Darkness came across the sky with a swooping rush. A million points of white light became visible. In the faint starshine Medea's face was ghost-pale.</p>
    <p>Through the near-darkness her eyes glowed.</p>
    <p>Faintly, and from far away, I heard a thin, trumpeting call. It was repeated.</p>
    <p>Then silence -- and a whispering that rose to a rhythmic thudding of shod hoofs.</p>
    <p>Past us moved a figure, a helot guardsman, unmasked, unspeaking, his gaze turned to the waiting gateway.</p>
    <p>Then another -- and another. Until three score of soldiers had gone past, and after them nearly three score of maidens -- the slave-girls.</p>
    <p>On a light, swift-looking roan stallion Matholch came by, stealing a glance at me from his yellow eyes. A cloak of forest green swirled from his shoulders.</p>
    <p>Behind him, the tiny form of Edeyrn, on a pony suited to her smallness. She was still cowled, her face hidden, but she now wore a cloak of purest yellow.</p>
    <p>Medea nodded at me. We touched our heels to the horses' flanks and took our places in the column. Behind us other figures rode, but I could not see them clearly. It was too dark.</p>
    <p>Through the gateway in the wall we went, still in silence save for the clopping of hoofs. We rode across the plain. The edges of the forest reached out toward us and swallowed us.</p>
    <p>I glanced behind. An enormous bulk against the sky showed the castle I had left.</p>
    <p>We rode under heavy, drooping branches. These were not the black trees of Medea's garden, but they were not normal either. I could not tell why an indefinable sense of strangeness reached out at me from the dun shadows above and around us.</p>
    <p>After a long time the ground dipped at our feet, and we saw below us the road's end. The moon had risen belatedly. By its yellow glare there materialized from the deep valley below us a sort of tower, a dark, windowless structure almost Gothic in plan, as though it had thrust itself from the black earth, from the dark grove of ancient and alien trees.</p>
    <p>Caer Secaire!</p>
    <p>I had been here before. Ganelon of the Dark World knew this spot well. But I did not know it; I sensed only that unpleasant familiarity, the deja vu phenomenon, known to all psychologists, coupled with a curious depersonalization, as though my own body, my mind, my very soul, felt altered and strange.</p>
    <p>Caer Secaire. Secaire? Somewhere, in my studies, I had encountered that name. An ancient rite, in -- in Gascony, that was it!</p>
    <p>The Mass of Saint Secaire!</p>
    <p>And the man for whom that Black Mass is said -- dies. That, too, I remembered. Was the Mass to be said for Ganelon tonight?</p>
    <p>This was not the Place of Llyr. Somehow I knew that. Caer Llyr was elsewhere and otherwise, not a temple, not a place visited by worshipers. But here in Caer Secaire, as in other temples throughout the Dark Land, Llyr might be summoned to his feasting, and, summoned, would come.</p>
    <p>Would Ganelon be his feast tonight? I clenched the reins with nervous hands. There was some tension in the air that I could not quite understand. Medea was calm beside me. Edeyrn was always calm. Matholch, I could swear, had nothing to take the place of nerves. Yet in the night there was tension, as if it breathed upon us from the dark trees along the roadside.</p>
    <p>Before us, in a silent, submissive flock, the soldiers and the slave-girls went. Some of the soldiers were armed. They seemed to be herding the rest, their movements mechanical, as if whatever had once made them free-willed humans was now asleep. I knew without being told the purpose for which those men and maidens were being driven toward Caer Secaire. But not even these voiceless mindless victims were tense. They went blindly to their doom. No, the tension came from the dark around us.</p>
    <p>Someone, something, waiting in the night!</p>

     <p>VII. Men of the Forest</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>FROM out of the dark woods, suddenly, startlingly, a trumpet-note rang upon the air. In the same instant there was a wild crashing in the underbrush, an outburst of shouts and cries, and the night was laced by the thin lightnings of unfamiliar gunfire. The road was suddenly thronging with green-clad figures who swarmed about the column of slaves ahead of us, grappling with the guards, closing in between us and the mindless victims at our forefront.</p>
    <p>My horse reared wildly. I fought him hard, forcing him down again, while stirrings of the old red rage I had felt before mounted in my brain. Ganelon, at sight of the forest people, struggled to take control. Him too I fought. Even in my surprise and bewilderment, I saw in this interruption the possibility of succor. I cracked my rearing horse between the ears with clubbed rein-loops and struggled to keep my balance.</p>
    <p>Beside me Medea had risen in her stirrups and was sending bolt after arrowy bolt into the green melee ahead of us, the dark rod that was her weapon leaping in her hand with every shot. Edeyrn had drawn aside, taking no part in the fight. Her small cowled figure sat crouching in the saddle, but her very stillness was alarming. I had the feeling she could end the combat in a moment if she chose.</p>
    <p>As for Matholch, his saddle was empty. His horse was already crashing away through the woods, and Matholch had hurled himself headlong into the fight, snarling joyously. The sound sent cold shudders down my spine. I could see that his green cloak covered a shape that was not wholly manlike, and the green people veered away from him as he plunged through their throngs toward the head of the column.</p>
    <p>The woodsfolk were trying a desperate rescue. I realized that immediately. I saw too that they dared not attack the Coven itself. All their efforts were aimed at overpowering the robot-like guards so that the equally robotlike victims might be saved from Llyr. And I could see that they were failing.</p>
    <p>For the victims were too apathetic to scatter. All will had long ago been drained away from them. They obeyed Orders -- that was all. And the forest people were leaderless. In a moment or two I realized that, and knew why. It was my fault. Edward Bond may have planned this daring raid, but through my doing, he was not here to guide them. And already the abortive fight was nearly over.</p>
    <p>Medea's flying fiery arrows struck down man after man. The mindless guards fired stolidly into the swarms that surged about them, and Matholch's deep-throated, exultant, snarling yells as he fought his way toward his soldiers were more potent than weapons. The raiders shrank back from the sound as they did not shrink from gunfire. In a moment, I knew, Matholch would reach his men, and organized resistance would break the back of this unguided mutiny.</p>
    <p>For an instant my own mind was a fierce battleground. Ganelon struggled to take control, and Edward Bond resisted him savagely.</p>
    <p>As Ganelon I knew my place was beside the wolfling; every instinct urged me forward to his side. But Edward Bond knew better. Edward Bond too knew where his rightful place should be.</p>
    <p>I shoved up my golden mask so that my face was visible. I drove my heels into my horse's sides and urged him headlong down the road behind Matholch. The sheer weight of the horse gave me an advantage Matholch, afoot, did not have. The sound of drumming hoofs and the lunging shoulders of my mount opened a way for me. I rose in the stirrups and shouted with Ganelon's deep, carrying roar:</p>
    <p>"Bond! Bond! Edward Bond!"</p>
    <p>The rebels heard me. For an instant the battle around the column wavered as every green-clad man paused to look back. Then they saw their lost leader, and a great echoing hail swept then- ranks.</p>
    <p>"Bond! Edward Bond!"</p>
    <p>The forest rang with it, and there was new courage in the sound. Matholch's wild snarl of rage was drowned in the roar of the forest men as they surged forward again to the attack.</p>
    <p>Out of Ganelon's memories I knew what I must do. The foresters were dragging down guard after guard, careless of the gunfire that mowed their disordered ranks. But only I could save the prisoners. Only Ganelon's voice could pierce the daze that held them.</p>
    <p>I kicked my frantic horse forward, knocking guards left and right, and gained the head of the column.</p>
    <p>"In the forest!" I shouted. "Waken and run! Run hard!"</p>
    <p>There was an instant forward surge as the slaves, still tranced in their dreadful dream, but obedient to the voice of a Coven member, lurched through the thin rank of their guard. The whole shape of the struggle changed as the core of it streamed irresistibly forward across the road and into the darkness of the woods.</p>
    <p>The green-clad attackers fell back to let the slaves through. It was a strange, voiceless flight they made. Not even the guards shouted, though they fired and fired again upon the retreating column, their faces as blank as if they slept without dreams.</p>
    <p>My flesh crawled as I watched that sight -- the men and women fleeing for their lives, the armed soldiers shooting them down, and the faces of them all utterly without expression. Voiceless they ran and voiceless they died when the gun-bolts found them.</p>
    <p>I wrenched my horse around and kicked him in the wake of the fleeing column. My golden mask slipped sidewise and I tore it off, waving to the scattering foresters, the moonlight catching brightly on its gold.</p>
    <p>"Save yourselves!" I shouted, "Scatter and follow me!"</p>
    <p>Behind me I heard Matholch's deep snarl, very near. I glanced over one shoulder as my horse plunged across the road. The shape-changer's tall figure faced me across the heads of several of his soldiers. His face was a wolflike snarling mask, and as I looked he lifted a dark rod like the one Medea had been using. I saw the arrow of white fire leap from it, and ducked in the saddle.</p>
    <p>The movement saved me. I felt a strong tug at my shoulders where the blue cape swirled out, and heard the tear of fabric as the bolt ripped through it and plunged hissing into the dark beyond. My horse lunged on into the woods.</p>
    <p>Then the trees were rustling all about me, and my bewildered horse stumbled and tossed up his head, whinnying in terror. Beside me in the dark a soft voice spoke softly.</p>
    <p>"This way," it said, and a hand seized the bridle.</p>
    <p>I let the woodsman lead me into the darkness.</p>
    <p>It was just dawn when our weary column came at last to the end of the journey, to the valley between cliffs where the woodsmen had established their stronghold. All of us were tired, though the blank-faced slaves we had rescued trudged on in an irregular column behind me, unaware that then" feet were torn and their bodies drooping with exhaustion.</p>
    <p>The forest men slipped through the trees around us, alert for followers. We had no wounded with us. The bolts the Coven shot never wounded. Whoever was struck fell dead in his tracks.</p>
    <p>In the pale dawn I would not have known the valley before me for the headquarters of a populous clan. It looked quite empty except for scattered boulders, mossy slopes, and a small stream that trickled down the middle, pink in the light of sunrise.</p>
    <p>One of the men took my horse then, and we went on foot up the valley, the robot slaves crowding behind. We seemed to be advancing up an empty valley. But when we had gone half its length, suddenly the woodsman at my right laid his hand upon my arm, and we paused, the rabble behind us jostling together without a murmur. Around me the woodsmen laughed softly. I looked up.</p>
    <p>She stood high upon a boulder that overhung the stream. She was dressed like a man in a tunic of soft, velvety green, cross-belted with a weapon swinging at each hip, but her hair was a fabulous mantle streaming down over her shoulders and hanging almost to her knees in a cascade of pale gold that rippled like water. A crown of pale gold leaves the color of the hair held it away from her face, and under the shining chaplet she looked down and smiled at us. Especially she smiled at me -- at Edward Bond.</p>
    <p>And her face was very lovely. It had the strength and innocence and calm serenity of a saint's face, but there was warmth and humor in the red lips. Her eyes were the same color as her tunic, deep green, a color I had never seen before in my own world.</p>
    <p>"Welcome back, Edward Bond," she said in a clear, sweet gently hushed voice, as if she had spoken softly for so many years that even now she did not dare speak aloud.</p>
    <p>She jumped down from the boulder, very lightly, moving with the sureness of a wild creature that had lived all its lifetime in the woods, as indeed I suppose she had. Her hair floated about her as lightly as a web, settling only slowly about her shoulders as she came forward, so that she seemed to walk in a halo of her own pale gold.</p>
    <p>I remembered what the woodsman Ertu had said to me in Medea's garden before her arrow struck him down.</p>
    <p>"Aries could convince you, Edward! Even if you're Ganelon, let me take you to Aries!"</p>
    <p>I stood before Aries now. Of that I was sure. And if I had needed any conviction before that the woodsmen's cause was mine, this haloed girl would have convinced me with her first words. But as for Ganelon --</p>
    <p>How could I know what Ganelon would do?</p>
    <p>That question was answered for me. Before my lips could frame words, before I could plan my next reaction, Aries came toward me, utterly without pretense or consciousness of the watching eyes. She put her hands on my shoulders and kissed me on the mouth.</p>
    <p>And that was not like Medea's kiss -- no! Aries' lips were cool and sweet, not warm with the dangerous, alluring honey-musk of the red witch. That intoxication of strange passion I remembered when I had held Medea in my arms did not sweep me now. There was a -- a purity about Aries, an honesty that made me suddenly, horribly homesick for Earth.</p>
    <p>She drew back. Her moss-green eyes met mine with quiet understanding. She seemed to be waiting.</p>
    <p>"Aries," I said, after a moment.</p>
    <p>And that seemed to satisfy her. The vague question that had begun to show on her face was gone.</p>
    <p>"I wondered," she said. "They didn't hurt you, Edward?"</p>
    <p>Instinctively I knew what I had to say.</p>
    <p>"No. We hadn't reached Caer Secaire. If the woodsmen hadn't attacked -- well, there'd have been a sacrifice."</p>
    <p>Aries reached out and lifted a corner of my torn cloak, her slim fingers light on the silken fabric.</p>
    <p>"The blue robe," she said. "Yes, that is the color the sacrifice wears. The gods cast their dice on our side tonight, Edward. Now as for this foul thing, we must get rid of it."</p>
    <p>Her green eyes blazed. She ripped the cloak from me, tore it across and dropped it to the ground.</p>
    <p>"You will not go hunting again alone," she added. "I told you it was dangerous. But you laughed at me. I'll wager you didn't laugh when the Coven slaves caught you! Or was that the way of it?"</p>
    <p>I nodded. A slow, deep fury was rising within me. So blue was the color of sacrifice, was it? My fears hadn't been groundless. At Caer Secaire I would have been the offering, going blindly to my doom. Matholch had known, of course. Trust his wolf-mind to appreciate the joke. Edeyrn, thinking her cool, inhuman thoughts in the shadow of her hood, she had known too. And Medea?</p>
    <p>Medea!</p>
    <p>She had dared betray me! Me, Ganelon!</p>
    <p>The Opener of the Gate, the Chose of Llyr, the great Lord Ganelon! They dared! Black thunder roared through my brain. I thought: By Llyr, but they'll suffer for this! They'll crawl to my feet like dogs. Begging my mercy!</p>
    <p>Rage had opened the floodgates, and Edward Bond was no more than a set of thin memories that had slipped from me as the blue cloak had slipped from my shoulders -- the blue cloak of the chosen sacrifice, on the shoulders of the Lord Ganelon!</p>
    <p>I blinked blindly around the green-clad circle. How had I come here? How dared these woodsrunners stand in defiance before me? Blood roared in my ears and the woodland swam around me. When it steadied I would draw my weapon and reap these upstarts as a mower reaps his wheat.</p>
    <p>But wait!</p>
    <p>First, the Coven, my sworn comrades, had betrayed me. Why, why! They had been glad enough to see me when they brought me back from the other world, the alien land of Earth. The woodsmen I could slay whenever I wished it -- the other problem came first. And Ganelon was a wise man. I might need these woods-people to help me in my vengeance. Afterward -- ah, afterward!</p>
    <p>I strove hard with memory. What could have happened to turn the Coven against me? I could have sworn this had not been Medea's original intention -- she had welcomed me back too sincerely for that. Matholch could have influenced her, but again, why, why? Or perhaps it was Edeyrn, or the Old One himself, Ghast Rhymi.-In any case, by the Golden Window that opens on the Abyss, they'd learn their error!</p>
    <p>"Edward!" a woman's voice, sweet and frightened, came to me as if from a great distance. I fought my way up through a whirlpool of fury and hatred. I saw a pale face haloed in floating hair, the green eyes troubled. I remembered.</p>
    <p>Beside Aries stood a stranger, a man whose cold gray eyes upon mine provided the shock I needed to bring me back to sanity. He looked at me as if he knew me -- knew Ganelon. I had never seen the man before.</p>
    <p>He was short and sturdy, young-looking in spite of the gray flecks in his close-cropped beard. His face was tanned so deeply it had almost the color of the brown earth. In his close-fitting green suit he was the perfect personification of a woodsrunner, a glider through the forest, unseen and dangerous. Watching the powerful flex of his muscles when he moved, I knew he would be a bad antagonist. And there was deep antagonism in the way he looked at me.</p>
    <p>A white, jagged scar had knotted his right cheek, quirking up his thin mouth so that he wore a perpetual crooked, sardonic half-grin. There was no laughter in those gelid gray eyes, though.</p>
    <p>And I saw that the circle of woodsmen had drawn back, ringing us, watching.</p>
    <p>The bearded man put out his arm and swept Aries behind him. Unarmed, he stepped forward, toward me.</p>
    <p>"No, Lorryn," Aries cried. "Don't hurt him."</p>
    <p>Lorryn thrust his face into mine.</p>
    <p>"Ganelon!" he said.</p>
    <p>And at the name a whisper of fear, of hatred, murmured around the circle of woodsfolk. I saw furtive movements, hands slipping quietly toward the hilts of weapons. I saw Aries' face change.</p>
    <p>The old-time cunning of Ganelon came to my aid.</p>
    <p>"No," I said, rubbing my forehead. "I'm Bond, all right. It was the drug the Coven gave me. It's still working."</p>
    <p>"What drug?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know," I told Lorryn. "It was in Medea's wine that I drank. And the long journey tonight has tired me."</p>
    <p>I took a few unsteady paces aside and leaned against the boulder, shaking my head as though to clear it. But my ears were alert. The low murmur of suspicion was dying.</p>
    <p>Cool fingers touched mine.</p>
    <p>"Oh, my dear," Aries said, and whirled on Lorryn. "Do you think I don't know Edward Bond from Ganelon? Lorryn, you're a fool!"</p>
    <p>"If the two weren't identical, we'd never have switched them in the first place," Lorryn said roughly. "Be sure, Aries. Very sure!"</p>
    <p>Now the whispering grew again. "Better to be sure," the woodsmen murmured. "No risks, Aries! If this is Ganelon, he must die."</p>
    <p>The doubt came back into Aries' green eyes. She thrust my hands away and stared at me. And the doubt did not fade.</p>
    <p>I gave her glance for glance.</p>
    <p>"Well, Aries?" I said.</p>
    <p>Her lips quivered.</p>
    <p>"It can't be. I know, but Lorryn is right. You know that; we can take no risks. To have the devil Ganelon back, after all that's happened, would be disastrous."</p>
    <p>Devil, I thought. The devil Ganelon. Ganelon had hated the woodsfolk, yes. But now he had another, greater hatred. In his hour of weakness, the Coven had betrayed him. The woods-folk could wait. Vengeance could not. It would be the devil Ganelon who would bring Caer Secaire and the Castle crashing down about the ears of the Coven!</p>
    <p>Which would mean playing a careful game!</p>
    <p>"Yes, Lorryn is right," I said. "You've no way of knowing I'm not Ganelon. Perhaps you know it, Aries -- " I smiled at her " -- but there must be no chances taken. Let Lorryn test me."</p>
    <p>"Well?" Lorryn said, looking at Aries.</p>
    <p>Doubtfully she glanced from me to the bearded man.</p>
    <p>"I -- very well, I suppose."</p>
    <p>Lorryn barked laughter.</p>
    <p>"My tests might fail. But there is one who can see the truth. Freydis."</p>
    <p>"Let Freydis test me," I said quickly, and was rewarded by seeing Lorryn hesitate.</p>
    <p>"Very well," he said at last. "If I'm wrong, I'll apologize now. But if I'm right, I'll kill you, or try to. There's only one other life I'd enjoy taking the more, and the shape-changer isn't in my reach -- yet."</p>
    <p>Again Lorryn touched his scarred cheek. At the thought of Lord Matholch, warmth came into his gray eyes; a distant ember burned for an instant there. I had seen hatred before. But not often had I seen such hatred as Lorryn held for -- the wolfing?</p>
    <p>Well, let him kill Matholch, if he could! There was another, softer throat in which I wanted to sink my fingers. Nor could all her magic protect the red witch when Ganelon came back to Caer Secaire, and broke the Coven like rotten twigs in his hands!</p>
    <p>Again the black rage thundered up like a deluging tide. That fury had wiped out Edward Bond -- but it had not wiped out Ganelon's cunning.</p>
    <p>"As you like, Lorryn," I said quietly. "Let's go to Freydis now."</p>
    <p>He nodded shortly. Lorryn on one side of me, Aries, puzzled and troubled, on the other, we moved up the valley, surrounded by the woodsfolk. The dazed slaves surged ahead.</p>
    <p>The canyon walls closed in. A cave-mouth showed in the granite ahead.</p>
    <p>We drew up in a rough semi-circle facing that cavern. Silence fell, broken by the whispering of leaves in the wind. The red sun was rising over the mountain wall.</p>
    <p>Out of the darkness came a voice, deep, resonant, powerful.</p>
    <p>"I am awake," it said. "What is your need?"</p>
    <p>"Mother Freydis, we have helots captured from the Coven," Aries said quickly. "The sleep is on them."</p>
    <p>"Send them in to me."</p>
    <p>Lorryn gave Aries an angry look. He pushed forward.</p>
    <p>"Mother Freydis!" he called.</p>
    <p>"I hear."</p>
    <p>"We need your sight. This man, Edward Bond -- I think he is Ganelon, came back from the Earth-world where you sent him."</p>
    <p>There was a long pause.</p>
    <p>"Send him into me," the deep voice finally said. "But first the helots."</p>
    <p>At a signal from Lorryn the woodsfolk began herding the slaves toward the cavemouth. They made no resistance. Empty-eyed, they trooped toward that cryptic darkness, and one by one, vanished.</p>
    <p>Lorryn looked at me and jerked his head toward the cavern. I smiled.</p>
    <p>"When I come out, we shall be friends again as before." I said.</p>
    <p>His eyes did not soften.</p>
    <p>"Freydis must decide that."</p>
    <p>I turned to Aries.</p>
    <p>"Freydis shall decide," I said. "But there is nothing to fear, Aries. Remember that. I am not Ganelon."</p>
    <p>She watched me, afraid, unsure, as I stepped back a pace or two.</p>
    <p>The silent throng of woodsfolk stared, waiting warily. They had their weapons ready. I laughed softly and turned. I walked toward the cave-mouth. The blackness swallowed me.</p>

     <p>VIII. Freydis</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>STRANGE to relate, I felt sure of myself as I walked up the sloping ramp in the darkness. Ahead of me, around a bend, I could see the glimmer of firelight, and I smiled. It had been difficult to speak with these upstart woodsrunners as if they were my equals, as if I were still Edward Bond. It would be difficult to talk to their witchwoman as if she had as much knowledge as a Lord of the Coven. Some she must have, or she could never have managed the transfer which had sent me into the Earth-world and brought out Edward Bond. But I thought I could deceive her or anyone these rebels had to offer me.</p>
    <p>The small cave at the turn of the corridor was empty except for Freydis. Her back was to me. She crouched on her knees before a small fire that burned, apparently without fuel, in a dish of crystal. She wore a white robe, and her white hair lay in two heavy braids along her back. I stopped, trying to feel like Edward Bond again, to determine what he would have said in this moment. Then Freydis turned and rose.</p>
    <p>She rose tremendously. Few in the Dark World can look me in the eye, but Freydis' clear blue gaze was level with my own. Her great shoulders and great, smooth arms were as powerful as a man's, and if age was upon her, it did not show in her easy motions or in the timeless face she turned to me. Only in the eyes was knowledge mirrored, and I knew as I met them that she was old indeed.</p>
    <p>"Good morning, Ganelon," she said in her deep, serene voice.</p>
    <p>I gaped. She knew me as surely as if she read my mind.</p>
    <p>Yet I was sure, or nearly sure, that no one in the Dark World could do that. For a moment I almost stammered. Then pride came to my rescue.</p>
    <p>"Good day, old woman," I said. "I come to offer you a chance for your life, if you obey me. We have a score to settle, you and I."</p>
    <p>She smiled.</p>
    <p>"Sit down, Covenanter," she said. "The last time we matched strength, you traded worlds. Would you like to visit Earth again, Lord Ganelon?"</p>
    <p>It was my turn to laugh.</p>
    <p>"You could not. And if you could, you wouldn't, after you hear me."</p>
    <p>Her blue eyes searched mine. --</p>
    <p>"You want something desperately," she said in a slow voice. "Your very presence here, offering me terms, proves that. I never thought to see the Lord Ganelon face to face unless he was in chains or in a berserker battle-mood. Your need of me, Lord Ganelon, serves as chains for you now. You are fettered by your need, and helpless."</p>
    <p>She turned back to the fire and sat down with graceful smoothness, her huge body under perfect control. Across the flame in its crystal bowl she faced me.</p>
    <p>"Sit down, Ganelon," she said again, "and we will bargain, you and I. One thing first -- do not waste my time with lies. I shall know if you tell the truth, Covenanter. Remember it."</p>
    <p>I shrugged.</p>
    <p>"Why should I bother with lies for such as you?" I said. "I have nothing to hide from you. The more of truth you know, the stronger you'll see my case is. First, though -- those slaves who came in before me?</p>
    <p>She nodded toward the back of the cave.</p>
    <p>"I sent them into the inner mountain. They sleep. You know the heavy sleep that comes upon those loosed from the Spell, Lord Ganelon."</p>
    <p>I sat down, shaking my head.</p>
    <p>"No -- no, that I can not quite remember. I -- you asked for the truth, old woman. Listen to it, then. I am Ganelon, but the false memories of Edward Bond still blur my mind. As Edward Bond I came here -- but Aries told me one thing that brought Ganelon back. She told me that the Coven, in my hour of weakness, had dressed me in the blue cloak of the sacrifice and I was riding for Caer Secaire when the woodsmen attacked us. Must I tell you now what my first wish in life is, witch-woman?"</p>
    <p>"Revenge on the Coven." She said it hollowly, her eyes burning into mine through the fire. "This is the truth you speak, Covenanter. You want my help in getting your vengeance. What can you offer the woodsfolk in return, save fire and sword? Why should we trust you, Ganelon?"</p>
    <p>Her ageless eyes burned into mine.</p>
    <p>"Because of what you want. My desire is vengeance. Yours is -- what?"</p>
    <p>"The end of Llyr -- the ruin of the Coven!" Her voice was resonant and her whole ageless face lighted as she spoke.</p>
    <p>"So. I too desire the ruin of the Coven and the end -- the end of Llyr." My tongue stumbled a little when I said that. I was not sure why. True, I had been sealed to Llyr in a great and terrible ceremony once -- I could recall that much. But Llyr and I were not one. We might have been, had events run differently. I shuddered now at the thought of it.</p>
    <p>Yes, it was Llyr's end I desired now -- must desire, if I hoped to live.</p>
    <p>Freydis looked at me keenly. She nodded.</p>
    <p>"Yes -- perhaps you do. Perhaps you do. What do you want of us then, Ganelon?"</p>
    <p>I spoke hastily:</p>
    <p>"I want you to swear to your people that I am Edward Bond. No -- wait! I can do more for them now than Edward Bond could do. Give thanks that I am Ganelon again, old woman! For only he can help you. Listen to me. Your foresters could not kill me. I know that. Ganelon is deathless, except on Llyr's altar. But they could fetter me and keep me prisoner here until you could work your spells again and bring Edward Bond back. And that would be foolish for your sake and for mine.</p>
    <p>"Edward Bond has done all he knows for you. Now it's Ganelon's turn. Who else could tell you how Llyr is vulnerable, or where Matholch keeps his secret weapons, or how one can vanquish Edeyrn? These things I know -- or I once knew. You must help me win my memories back, Freydis. After that -- " I grinned fiercely.</p>
    <p>She nodded. Then she sat quiet for awhile.</p>
    <p>"What do you want me to do, then, Ganelon?" she asked, at last.</p>
    <p>"Tell me first about the bridging of the worlds," I said eagerly. "How did you change Edward Bond and me?"</p>
    <p>Freydis smiled grimly.</p>
    <p>"Not so fast, Covenanter!" she answered. "I have my secrets too! I will answer only a part of that question. We wrought the change, as you must guess, simply to rid ourselves of you. You must remember how fiercely you were pressing us in your raids for slaves, in your hatred of our freedom. We are a proud people, Ganelon, and we would not be oppressed forever. But we knew there was no death for you except in a way we could not use.</p>
    <p>"I knew of the twin world of Earth. I searched, and found Edward Bond. And after much striving, much effort, I wrought a certain transition that put you in the other world, with memories of Edward Bond blotting out your own.</p>
    <p>"We were rid of you. True, we had Edward Bond with us, and we did not trust him either. He was too like you. But him we could kill if we must. We did not. He is a strong man, Covenanter. We came to trust him and rely upon him. He brought us new ideas of warfare. He was a good leader. It was he who planned the attack upon the next Coven sacrifice --"</p>
    <p>"An attack that failed," I said. "Or would have failed, had I not swung my weight into the balance. Edward Bond had Earth-knowledge, yes. But his weapons and defenses could only have breached the outer walls of the Coven. You know there are powers, seldom used, but powers that do not fail!"</p>
    <p>"I know," she said. "Yes, I know, Ganelon. Yet we had to try, at least. And the Coven had been weakened by losing you. Without you, none of the others would have dared call on Llyr, except perhaps Ghast Rhymi." She stared deeply into the fire. "I know you Ganelon. I know the pride that burns in your soul. And I know, too, that vengeance, now, would be very dear to your heart. Yet you were sealed to Llyr, once, and you have been Covenanter since your birth. How do I know you can be trusted?"</p>
    <p>I did not answer that. And, after a moment, Freydis turned toward the smoke-blackened wall. She twitched aside a curtain I had not seen. There, in an alcove, was a Symbol, a very ancient Sign, older than civilization, older than human speech.</p>
    <p>Yes, Freydis would be one of the few who knew what that Symbol meant. As I knew.</p>
    <p>"Now will you swear that you speak with a straight tongue?" she said.</p>
    <p>I moved my hand in the ritual gesture that bound me irrevocably. This was an oath I could not break without being damned and doubly damned, in this world and the next. But I had no hesitation. I spoke truth!</p>
    <p>"I will destroy the Coven!" I said.</p>
    <p>"And Llyr?"</p>
    <p>"I will bring an end to Llyr!"</p>
    <p>But sweat stood out on my forehead as I said that. It was not easy.</p>
    <p>Freydis twitched the curtain back into place. She seemed satisfied.</p>
    <p>"I have less doubt now," she said. "Well, Ganelon, the Norns weave strange threads together to make warp and woof of destiny. Yet there is a pattern, though sometimes we cannot see it. I did not ask you to swear fealty to the forest-folk."</p>
    <p>"I realize that."</p>
    <p>"You would not have sworn it," she said. "Nor is it necessary. After the Coven is broken, after an end is made to Llyr, I can guard the people of the woods against even you, Ganelon. And we may meet in battle then. But until then we are allies. I will name you -- Edward Bond."</p>
    <p>"I'll need more than that," I told her. "If the masquerade is to pass unchallenged."</p>
    <p>"No one will doubt my word," Freydis said. Firelight flickered on her great frame, her smooth, ageless face.</p>
    <p>"I cannot fight the Coven till I get back my memories. The memories of Ganelon. All of them."</p>
    <p>She shook her head.</p>
    <p>"Well," she said slowly, "I cannot do too much on that score. Something, yes. But writing on the mind is touchy work, and memories, once erased, are not easily brought back. You still have Edward Bond's memories?"</p>
    <p>I nodded.</p>
    <p>"But my own, no. They're fragmentary. I know, for example, that I was sealed to Llyr, but the details I don't remember."</p>
    <p>"It would be as well, perhaps, to let that memory stay lost,"</p>
    <p>Freydis said somberly. "But you are right. A dulled tool is no use. So listen."</p>
    <p>Rock-still, boulder-huge, she stood across the fire from me. Her voice deepened.</p>
    <p>"I sent you into the Earth-World. I brought your double, Edward Bond, here. He helped us, and -- Aries loved him, after a while. Even Lorryn, who does not trust many, grew to trust Edward Bond."</p>
    <p>"Who is Lorryn?"</p>
    <p>"One of us now. Not always. Years ago he had his cottage in the forest; he hunted, and few were as cunning as Lorryn in the chase. His wife was very young. Well, she died. Lorryn came back to this cottage one night and found death there, and blood, and a wolf that snarled at him from a bloody muzzle. He fought the wolf; he did not kill it. You saw Lorryn's cheek. His whole body is like that, scarred and wealed from wolf-fangs."</p>
    <p>"A wolf?" I said. "Not --"</p>
    <p>"A wolfling," Freydis said. "Lycanthrope, shape-changer. Matholch. Some day Lorryn will kill Matholch. He lives only for that."</p>
    <p>"Let him have the red dog," I said contemptuously. "If he likes, I'll give him Matholch flayed!"</p>
    <p>"Aries and Lorryn and Edward Bond have planned their campaign," Freydis said. "They swore that the last Sabbat had been celebrated in the Dark World. Edward Bond showed them new weapons he remembered from Earth. Such weapons have been built and are in the arsenal, ready. No Sabbats have been held since Medea and her followers went searching to Earth; the woodsfolk held their hands. There was nothing to strike at except old Ghast Rhymi. Now Medea and the rest of the Coven are back, they're ready. If you lead against them Ganelon, the Coven can be smashed, I think."</p>
    <p>"The Coven has its own weapons," I muttered. "My memory fails -- but I think Edeym has a power that -- that -- " I shook my head. "No, it's gone."</p>
    <p>"How can Llyr be destroyed?" Freydis asked.</p>
    <p>"I -- I may have known once. Not now."</p>
    <p>"Look at me," she said. And leaned forward, so that it seemed as though her ageless face was bathed in the fires.</p>
    <p>Through the flames her gaze caught mine. Some ancient power kindled her clear blue eyes. Like pools of cool water under a bright sky -- pools deep and unstirring, where one could sink into an azure silence forever and ever....</p>
    <p>As I looked the blue waters clouded, grew dark. I saw a great black dome against a black sky. I saw the thing that dwells deepest and most strongly in the mind of Ganelon -- Caer Llyr!</p>
    <p>The dome swam closer. It loomed above me. Its walls parted like dark water, and I moved in memory down the great smooth, shining corridor that leads to Llyr Himself.</p>

     <p>IX. Realm of the Superconscious</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>ONWARD I moved. Faces flickered before me -- Matholch's fierce grin, Edeyrn's cowled head with its glance that chilled, Medea's savage beauty that no man could ever forget, even in his hatred. They looked at me, mistrustfully. Their lips moved in soundless question. Curiously, I knew these were real faces I saw.</p>
    <p>In the magic of Freydis' spell I was drifting through some dimensionless place where only the mind ventures, and I was meeting here the thoughts of the questing Coven, meeting the eyes of their minds. They knew me. They asked me fiercely a question I could not hear.</p>
    <p>Death was in the face Matholch's mind turned to mine. All his hatred of me boiled furiously in his yellow wolf-eyes. His lips moved -- almost I could hear him. Medea's features swam up before me, blotting out the shape-changer. Her red mouth framed a question -- over and over.</p>
    <p>"Ganelon, where are you? Ganelon, my lover, where are you? You must come back to us. Ganelon!"</p>
    <p>Edeyrn's faceless head moved between Medea and me, and very distantly I heard her cool, small voice echoing the same thought.</p>
    <p>"You must return to us, Ganelon. Return to us and die!"</p>
    <p>Anger drew a red curtain between those faces and myself.</p>
    <p>Traitors, betrayers, false to the Coven oath! How dared they threaten Ganelon, the strongest of them all? How dared they -- and why?</p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <p>My brain reeled with the query. And then I realized there was one face missing from the Coven. These three had been searching the thought-planes for me, but what of Ghast Rhymi?</p>
    <p>Deliberately I groped for the contact of his mind.</p>
    <p>I could not touch him. But I remembered. I remembered Ghast Rhymi, whose face Edward Bond had never seen. Old, old, old, beyond good and evil, beyond fear and hatred, this was Ghast Rhymi, the wisest of the Coven. If he willed, he would answer my groping thought. If he willed not, nothing could force him. Nothing could harm the Eldest, for he lived on only by force of his own will.</p>
    <p>He could end himself instantly, by the power of a thought. And he is like a candle flame, flickering away as one grasps at him. Life holds nothing more for him. He does not cling to it. If I had tried to seize him he could slip like fire or water from my grasp. He would as soon be dead as alive. But unless he must, he would not break his deep calm to think the thought that would change him into clay.</p>
    <p>His mind and the image of his face remained hidden from my quest. He would not answer. The rest of the Coven still kept calling to me with a strange desperation in their minds -- return and die, Lord Ganelon! But Ghast Rhymi did not care.</p>
    <p>So I knew that it was at his command the death-sentence had been passed. And I knew I must seek him out and somehow force an answer from him -- from Ghast Rhymi, upon whom all force was strengthless. Yet force him I must!</p>
    <p>All this while my mind had been drifting effortlessly down the great hallway of Caer Llyr, borne upon that tide that flows deepest in the mind of Ganelon, the Chosen of Llyr -- Ganelon, who must one day return to Him Who Waits.... As I was returning now.</p>
    <p>A golden window glowed before me. I knew it for the window through which great Llyr looks out upon his world, the window through which he reaches for his sacrifices. And Llyr was hungry. I felt his hunger. Llyr was roaming the thought-planes too, and in the moment that I realized again where my mind was drifting, I felt suddenly the stir of a great reaching, a tentacular groping through the golden window.</p>
    <p>Llyr had sensed my presence in the planes of his mind. He knew his Chosen. He stretched out his godlike grasp to fold me into that embrace from which there is no returning.</p>
    <p>I heard the soundless cry of Medea, vanishing like a puff of smoke out of the thought-plane as she blanked her mind defensively from the terror. I heard Matholch's voiceless howl of pure fear as he closed his own mind. There was no sound from Edeyrn, but she was gone as utterly as if she had never thought a thought. I knew the three of them sat somewhere in their castle, eyes and minds closed tightly, willing themselves to blankness as Llyr roamed the thought-lanes seeking the food he had been denied so long.</p>
    <p>A part of me shared the terror of the Coven. But a part of me remembered Llyr. For an instant, almost I recaptured the dark ecstasy of that moment when Llyr and I were one, and the memory of horror and of dreadful joy came back, the memory of a power transcending all earthly things.</p>
    <p>This was mine for the taking, if I opened ray mind to Llyr. Only one man in a generation is sealed to Llyr, sharing in his godhead, exulting with him in the ecstasy of human sacrifice -- and I was that one man if I chose to complete the ceremony that would make me Llyr's. If I chose, if I dared -- ah!</p>
    <p>The memory of anger came back. I must not release myself into that promised joy. I had sworn to put an end to Llyr. I had sworn by the Sign to finish the Coven and Llyr. Slowly, reluctantly, my mind pulled itself back from the fringing contact of those tentacles.</p>
    <p>The moment that tentative contact was broken, a full tide of horror washed over me. Almost I had touched -- him. Almost I had let myself be defiled beyond all human understanding by the terrible touch of -- of -- There is no word in any language for the thing that was Llyr. But I understood what had been in my mind as Edward Bond when I realized that to dwell on the same soil as Llyr, share the same life, was a defilement that made earth and life too terrible to endure -- if one knew Llyr.</p>
    <p>I must put an end to him. In that moment, I knew I must stand up and face the being we knew as Llyr and fight him to his end. No human creature had ever fully faced him -- not even his sacrifices, not even his Chosen. But his slayer would have to face him, and I had sworn to be his slayer.</p>
    <p>Shuddering, I drew back from the black depths of Caer Llyr, struggled to the surface of that still blue pool of thought which had been Freydis' eyes. The darkness ebbed around me and by degrees the walls of the cave came back, the fuelless flame, the great smooth-limbed sorceress who held my mind in the motionless deeps of her spell.</p>
    <p>As I returned to awareness, slowly, slowly, knowledge darted through my mind in lightning-flashes, too swiftly to shape into words.</p>
    <p>I knew, I remembered.</p>
    <p>Ganelon's life came back in pictures that went vividly by and were printed forever on my brain. I knew his powers; I knew his secret strengths, his hidden weaknesses. I knew his sins. I exulted in his power and pride. I returned to my own identity and was fully Ganelon again. Or almost fully.</p>
    <p>But there were still hidden things. Too much had been erased from my memory to come back in one full tide. There were gaps, and important gaps, in what I could recall.</p>
    <p>The blue darkness cleared. I looked in Freydis' clear gaze across the fire. I smiled, feeling a cold and arrogant confidence welling up in-me.</p>
    <p>"You have done well, witch-woman," I told her.</p>
    <p>"You remember?"</p>
    <p>"Enough. Yes, enough." I laughed. "There are two trials before me, and the first is the easier of the two, and it is impossible. But I shall accomplish it."</p>
    <p>"Ghast Rhymi?" she asked in a quiet voice.</p>
    <p>"How do you know that?"</p>
    <p>"I know the Coven. And I think, but I am not sure, that in Ghast Rhymi's hands lie the secrets of the Coven and of Llyr. But no man can force Ghast Rhymi to do his bidding."</p>
    <p>"I'll find the way. Yes, I will even tell you what my next task is. You shall have the truth as I just learned it, witch. Do you know of the Mask and the Wand?"</p>
    <p>Her eyes on mine, she shook her head. "Tell me. Perhaps I can help."</p>
    <p>I laughed again. It was so fantastically implausible that she and I should stand here, sworn enemies of enemy clans, planning a single purpose together! Yet there was only a little I hid from her that day, and I think not very much that Freydis hid from me.</p>
    <p>"In the palace of Medea, is a crystal mask and the silver Wand of Power," I told her. "What that Wand is I do not quite remember -- yet. But when I find it, my hands will know. And with it I can overcome Medea and Matholch and all their powers. As for Edeyrn -- well, this much I know. The Mask will save me from her."</p>
    <p>I hesitated.</p>
    <p>Medea I knew now. I knew the strange hungers and the stranger thirsts that drove the beautiful red and white witch to her trystings. I knew now, and shuddered a little to think of it, why she took her captives with those arrows of fire that did not kill at all, but only stunned them.</p>
    <p>In the Dark World, my world, mutation has played strange changes upon flesh that began as human. Medea was one of the strangest of all. There is no word in Earth-tongues for it, because no creature such as Medea ever walked Earth. But there is an approximation. In reality perhaps, and certainly in legend, beings a little like her have been known on Earth. The name they give them is Vampire.</p>
    <p>But Edeyrn, no. I could not remember. It may be that not even Ganelon had ever known. I only knew that in time of need, Edeyrn would uncover her face.</p>
    <p>"Freydis," I said, and hesitated again. "What is Edeyrn?"</p>
    <p>She shook her massive head, the white braids stirring on her shoulders.</p>
    <p>"I have never known. I have only probed at her mind now and then, when we met as you met her today, on the thought-lanes. I have much power, Ganelon, but I have always drawn back from the chill I sensed beneath Edeyrn's hood. No, I cannot tell you what she is."</p>
    <p>I laughed again. Recklessness was upon me now.</p>
    <p>"Forget Edeyrn," I said. "When I have forced Ghast Rhymi to my bidding, and faced Llyr with the weapon that will end him, what shall I fear of Edeyrn? The Crystal Mask is a talisman against her. That much I know. Let her be whatever monstrous thing she wills -- Ganelon has no fear of her.</p>
    <p>"There is a weapon, then against Llyr too?"</p>
    <p>"There is a sword," I said. "A sword that is -- is not quite a sword as we think of weapons. My mind is cloudy there still. But I know that Ghast Rhymi can tell me where it is. A weapon, yet not a weapon. The Sword Called Llyr."</p>
    <p>For an instant, as I spoke that name, it seemed to me that the fire between us flickered as if a shadow had passed across its brightness. I should not have called the name aloud. An echo of it had gone ringing across the realms of thought, and in Caer Llyr perhaps Llyr Himself had stirred behind the golden window -- stirred, and looked out.</p>
    <p>Even here, I felt a faint flicker of hunger from that far-away domed place. And suddenly, I knew what I had done, Llyr was awake!</p>
    <p>I stared at Freydis with widened eyes, meeting her blue gaze that was widening too. She must have felt the stir as it ran formlessly all through the Dark World. In the Castle of the Coven I knew they had felt it too, perhaps that they looked at one another with the same instant dread which flashed between Freydis and me here.</p>
    <p>Llyr was awake!</p>
    <p>And I had wakened him. I had gone drifting in thought down that shining corridor and stood in thought before the very window itself, Llyr's Chosen, facing Llyr's living window. No wonder he had stirred at last to full awakening.</p>
    <p>Exultation bubbled up in my mind.</p>
    <p>"Now they must move!" I told Freydis joyfully. "You wrought better than you knew when you set my mind free to rove its old track. Llyr wakens and is hungrier man the Coven ever dared let him grow before. For overlong there has been no Sabbat, and Llyr ravens for his sacrifice. Have you spies watching the Castle now, witch-woman?"</p>
    <p>She nodded.</p>
    <p>"Good. Then we will know when the slaves are gathered again for a Sabbat meeting. It will be soon. It must be soon! And Edward Bond will lead an assault upon the Castle while the Coven are at Sabbat in Caer Secaire. There will be the Mask and the Wand, old woman!" My voice deepened to a chant of triumph. "The Mask and the Wand for Ganelon, and Ghast Rhymi alone in the Castle to answer me if he can! The Norns fight on our side, Freydis!"</p>
    <p>She looked at me long and without speaking.</p>
    <p>Then a grim smile broke across her face and stooping, she spread her bare hand, palm down, upon the fuelless flame. I saw the fire lick up around her fingers. Deliberately she crushed it out beneath her hand, not flinching at all.</p>
    <p>The fire flared and died away. The crystal dish stood empty upon its pedestal, and dimness closed around us. In that twilight the woman was a great figure of marble, towering beside me.</p>
    <p>I heard her deep voice.</p>
    <p>"The Norns are with us, Ganelon," she echoed. "See that you fight upon our side too, as far as your oath will take you. Or you must answer to the gods and to me. And by the gods -- " she laughed harshly " -- by the gods, if you betray me, I swear I'll smash you with no other power than this!''</p>
    <p>In the dimness I saw her lift her great arms. We looked one another in the eye, this mighty sorceress and I, and I was not sure but that she could overcome me in single combat if the need arose. By magic and by sheer muscle, I recognized an equal. I bent my head.</p>
    <p>"So be it, Sorceress," I said, and we clasped hands there in the darkness. And almost I hoped I need not have to betray her.</p>
    <p>Side by side, we went down the corridor to the cave mouth.</p>
    <p>The half-circle of foresters still awaited us. Aries and the scarred Lorryn stood a little forward, lifting their heads eagerly as we emerged. I paused, catching the quiver of motion as calloused hands slipped stealthily toward hilt and bowstring. Panic, subdued and breathless, swept around the arc of woods-folk.</p>
    <p>I stood there savoring the moment of terror among them, knowing myself Ganelon and the nemesis that would bring harsh justice upon them all, in my own time. In my own good time.</p>
    <p>But first I needed their help.</p>
    <p>At my shoulder the deep voice of Freydis boomed through the glade.</p>
    <p>"I have looked upon this man," she said. "I name him -- Edward Bond."</p>
    <p>Distrust of me fell away from them; Freydis' words reassured them.</p>

     <p>X. Swords for the Coven</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>NOW the sap that runs through Ygdrasill-root stirred from its wintry sluggishness, and the inhuman guardians of the fate-tree roused to serve me. The three Norns -- the Destiny-weavers -- I prayed to them!</p>
    <p>Urdur who rules the past!</p>
    <p>She whispered of the Covenanters, and their powers and their weaknesses; of Matholch, the wolfling, whose berserk rages were his great flaw, the gap in his armor through which I could strike, when fury had drowned his wary cunning; of the red witch and of Edeyrn -- and of old Ghast Rhymi. My enemies. Enemies whom I could destroy, with the aid of certain talismans that I had remembered now. Whom I would destroy!</p>
    <p>Verdandi who rules the present!</p>
    <p>Edward Bond had done his best. In the caves the rebels had showed me were weapons, crude rifles and grenades, gas-bombs and even a few makeshift flame-throwers. They would be useful against the Coven's slaves. How useless they would be against the Covenanters I alone knew. Though Freydis may have known too.</p>
    <p>Yet Aries and Lorryn and their reckless followers were ready to use those Earth-weapons, very strange to them, in a desperate attack on the Castle. And I would give them that chance, as soon as our spies brought word of Sabbat-preparations. It would be soon. It would have to be soon. For Llyr was awake now -- hungry, thirsting -- beyond the Golden Window that is his door into the worlds of mankind.</p>
    <p>Skuld who rules the future!</p>
    <p>To Skuld I prayed most of all. I thought that the Coven would ride again to Caer Secaire before another dawn came. By then I wanted the rebels ready.</p>
    <p>Edward Bond had trained them well. There was military discipline, after a fashion. Each man knew his equipment thoroughly, and all were expert woodsmen. We laid our plans, Aries and Lorryn and I -- though I did not tell them everything I intended -- and group by group, the rebels slipped away into the forest, bound for the Castle.</p>
    <p>They would not attack. They would not reveal themselves until the signal was given. Meantime, they would wait, concealed in the gulleys and scrub-woods around the Castle. But they would be ready. When the time came, they would ride down to the great gates. Their grenades would be helpful there.</p>
    <p>Nor did it seem fantastic that we should battle magic with grenades and rifle. For I was beginning to realize more and more, as my memory slowly returned, that the Dark World was not ruled by laws of pure sorcery. To an Earth-mind such creatures as Matholch and Medea would have seemed supernatural, but I had a double mind, for as Ganelon I could use the memories of Edward Bond as a workman uses tools.</p>
    <p>I had forgotten nothing I had ever known about Earth. And by applying logic to the Dark World, I understood things I had always before taken for granted.</p>
    <p>The mutations gave the key. There are depths in the human mind forever unplumbed, potentialities for power as there are lost, atrophied senses -- the ancient third eye that is the pineal gland. And the human organism is the most specialized thing of flesh that exists.</p>
    <p>Any beast of prey is better armed with fang and claw. Man has only his brain. But as carnivores grew longer, more deadly talons, so man's mind developed correspondingly. Even in Earth-world there are mediums, mind-readers, psychomantic experts, ESP specialists. In the Dark World the mutations had run wild, producing cosmic abortions for which there might be no real need for another million years.</p>
    <p>And such minds, with their new powers, would develop tools for those powers. The wands. Though no technician, I could understand their principle. Science tends toward simpler mechanisms; the klystron and the magnetron are little more than metal bars. Yet, under the right conditions, given energy and direction, they are powerful machines.</p>
    <p>Well, the wands tapped the tremendous electromagnetic energy of the planet, which is, after all, simply a gargantuan magnet. As for the directive impulse, trained minds could easily supply that.</p>
    <p>Whether or not Matholch actually changed to wolf-form I did not know, though I did not think he did. Hypnosis was part of the answer. An angry cat will fluff out its fur and seem double its size. A cobra will, in effect, hypnotize its prey. Why? In order to break down the enemy's defenses, to disarm him, to weaken the single-purposiveness that is so vital in combat. No, perhaps Matholch did not turn into a wolf, but those under the spell of his hypnosis thought he did, which came to the same thing in the end.</p>
    <p>Medea? There was a parallel. There are diseases in which blood transfusions are periodically necessary. Not that Medea drank blood; she had other thirsts. But vital nervous energy is as real a thing as a leucocyte, and witch though she was, she did not need magic to serve her needs.</p>
    <p>Of Edeyrn I was not so sure. Some stray remembrances hung like mists in my mind. Once I had known what she was, what chilling power lay hidden in the darkness of her cowl. And that was not magic either. The Crystal Mask would protect me against Edeyrn, but I knew no more than that.</p>
    <p>Even Llyr -- even Llyr! He was no god. That I knew well. Yet what he might be was something I could not even guess at as yet. Eventually I meant to find out, and the Sword Called Llyr, which was not a true sword, would aid me then.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, I had my part to play. Even with Freydis as my sponsor, I could not afford to rouse suspicion among the rebels. I had explained that Medea's drug had left me weak and shaken. That helped to explain any minor lapses I might make. Curiously, Lorryn seemed to have accepted me fully at Freydis' word, while in Aries' behavior I detected a faint, almost imperceptible reserve. I do not think that she suspected the truth. Or, if she did she was trying not to admit it, even in her own mind.</p>
    <p>And I could not afford to let that suspicion grow.</p>
    <p>The valley was very active now.</p>
    <p>Much had happened since I came there in the dawn. I had been through enough exertion both physical and emotional to last an ordinary man for a week, but Ganelon had only begun his battle. It was thanks to Edward Bond that our plans for attack would be formulated so readily, and in a way I was glad I had been too busy for anything but the most impersonal planning with Aries and Lorryn.</p>
    <p>It helped to cover the great gaps of my ignorance about things Edward Bond should know. Many times I angled craftily for information, many times I had to call upon the excuse of the mythical drug and upon the exhaustion of my ordeal at the Castle. But by the time our plans were laid, it seemed to me that even Aries' suspicions were partly lulled.</p>
    <p>I knew I must lull them utterly.</p>
    <p>We rose from the great map-table in the council-cavern. All of us were tired. I met Lorryn's scar-twisted grin, warmth in it now as he smiled at the man he thought his sworn friend, and I made Edward Bond's face smile back at him.</p>
    <p>"We'll do it this time," I told him confidently. "This time we'll win!"</p>
    <p>His smile twisted suddenly into a grimace, and the light like embers glowed in his deep eyes.</p>
    <p>"Remember," he growled. "Matholch -- for me!"</p>
    <p>I looked down at the relief-map of the table, very skillfully made under Edward Bond's directions.</p>
    <p>The dark green hills rolling with their strange forests of semi-animate trees, every brook traced in white plaster, every roadway marked. I laid my hand on the little mound of towers that was a miniature Castle of the Coven. From it stretched the highway I had ridden last night, beside Medea, in my blue sacrificial robe. There was the valley and the windowless tower of Caer Secaire which had been our destination.</p>
    <p>For a moment I rode that highway again, in the darkness and the starshine, seeing Medea beside me in her scarlet cloak, her face a pale oval in the dusk, her mouth black-red, her eyes shining at me. I remembered the feel of that fiercely yielding body in my arms as I had held her last night, as I had held her so many times before. In my mind whirled a question.</p>
    <p>Medea, Medea, red witch of Colchis, why did you betray me?</p>
    <p>I ground my palm down on the tiny plaster towers of the Castle, feeling them powder away beneath my hand. I grinned fiercely at the ruin I had made of Edward Bond's model.</p>
    <p>"We'll have no need for this again!" I said through my teeth.</p>
    <p>Lorryn laughed.</p>
    <p>"No need to repair it. Tomorrow the Coven Castle will be wreckage too."</p>
    <p>I dusted the powdered plaster from my hand and looked across the table at the silent Aries. She looked at me gravely, waiting. I smiled.</p>
    <p>"We haven't had a moment alone together," I said, making my voice tender. "I'll need sleep before I leave tonight, but there's time for a walk, if you'll come with me."</p>
    <p>The grave green gaze dwelt upon mine. Then she nodded, without smiling, and came around the table, stretching out her hand to me. I took it and we went down the steps to the cave-mouth and out into the glen, neither of us speaking. I let her lead the way, and we walked in silence toward the upper end of the valley, the little stream tinkling away beside us.</p>
    <p>Aries walked very lightly, her gossamer hair floating behind her in a pale misty veil. I wondered if it was by intent that she kept her free hand resting upon the bolstered weapon at her side.</p>
    <p>It was hard for me to keep my mind upon her, or to care whether or not she knew me for myself. Medea's face in all its beauty and its evil floated before me up the glen, a face no man who looked upon it could ever forget. For a moment I was angry at the recollection that Edward Bond, in my flesh, had taken last night the kisses she meant for Ganelon.</p>
    <p>Well, I would see her again tonight, before she died by my hand!</p>
    <p>In my mind I saw the tiny roadway of the map-table, winding down from Coven Castle to the sacrificial temple. Along the real road, sometime in the night to come, I knew the cavalcade would ride again as it had ridden with me last night. And again there would be forest men hiding along the road, and again I would lead them against the Coven. But this time the outcome would be very different from anything either the rebels or the Coven could expect.</p>
    <p>What a strange web the Morns had woven! Last night as Edward Bond, tonight as Ganelon, I would lead the same men in the same combat against the same foe, but with a purpose as different as night from day.</p>
    <p>The two of us, deadly enemies though we shared the same body in a strange, inverted way -- enemies though we had never met and never could meet, for all our common flesh. It was an enigma too curious to unravel.</p>
    <p>"Edward," a voice said at my shoulder. I looked down.</p>
    <p>Aries was facing me with the same enigmatic gaze I had met so often today. "Edward, is she very beautiful?"</p>
    <p>I stared at her.</p>
    <p>"Who?"</p>
    <p>"The witch. The Coven witch. Medea."</p>
    <p>I almost laughed aloud. Was this the answer to all her aloofness of the day? Did she think my own withdrawal, all the changes she sensed in me, were due to the charms of a rival beauty? Well, I must set her mind at rest about that, at any rate. I called upon Llyr to forgive me the lie, and I took her shoulders in my hands and said:</p>
    <p>"There is no woman on this world or on Earth half so beautiful as you, my darling.""</p>
    <p>Still she looked up at me gravely.</p>
    <p>"When you mean that, Edward, I'll be glad," she said. "You don't mean it now. I can tell. No." She put her fingers across my mouth as I began to protest. "Let's not talk about her now. She's a sorceress. She has powers neither of us can fight. It isn't your fault or mine that she's too beautiful to forget all in a moment. Never mind now. Look! Do you remember this place?"</p>
    <p>She twisted deftly from my grasp and swept out a hand toward the panorama spread below us. We stood in a grove of tall, quivering trees high on the crest of the low mountain. The leaves and branches made a bower around us with their showers of shaking tendrils, but through an opening here and there we could see the rolling country far below us, glowing in the light of the red westering sun.</p>
    <p>"This will be ours some day," said Aries softly. "After the Coven is gone, after Llyr has vanished. We'll be free to live above ground, clear the forests, build our cities -- live like men again. Think of it, Edward! A whole world freed from savagery. And all because there were a few of us at the start who did not fear the Coven, and who found you. If we win the fight, Edward, it will be because of you and Freydis. We would all have been lost without you."</p>
    <p>She turned suddenly, her pale gold hair flying out around her face like a halo of floating gauze, and she smiled at me with a sudden, bewitching charm I had never seen upon her face before.</p>
    <p>Until now she had always turned a grave reserve to my advances. Now suddenly I saw her as Edward Bond had, and it came to me in a flash of surprise that Bond was a very fortunate man, after all. Medea's sultry scarlet beauty would never wholly vanish from my mind, I knew, but this Aries had her own delicate and delightful charm.</p>
    <p>She was very near me, her lips parted as she smiled up into my face. For an instant I envied Edward Bond. Then I remembered. I was Edward Bond! But it was Ganelon who stooped suddenly and seized the forest girl in a fiercely ardent embrace that amazed her, for I felt her gasp of surprise against my breast and her stir of protest in the moment before my lips touched hers.</p>
    <p>Then she protested no longer.</p>
    <p>She was a strange, wild, shy little creature, very pleasant in my arms, very sweet to kiss. I knew by the way she responded to me that Edward Bond had never held her like this. But then Edward Bond was a weakling and a fool. And before the kiss had ended I knew where I would turn first for solace when Medea had paid for treachery with her life. I would not forget Medea, but I would not soon forget this kiss of Aries', either.</p>
    <p>She clung to me in silence for a moment, her gossamer hair floating like thistledown about us both, and above her head I looked out over the valley which she had seen in her mind's eyes peopled with free forest folk, dotted with their cities. I knew that dream would never come true.</p>
    <p>But I had a dream of my own!</p>
    <p>I saw the forest people toiling to raise my mighty castle here perhaps on this very mountaintop, a castle to dominate the whole countryside and the lands beyond it. I saw them laboring under my overseers to conquer still further lands. I saw my armies marching, my slaves in my fields and mines, my navies on the dark oceans of a world that might well be mine.</p>
    <p>Aries should share it with me -- for awhile. For a little while.</p>
    <p>"I will always love you!" I said at her ear in the voice of Edward Bond. But it was Ganelon's lips that found her lips in the one last ardent kiss I had time for then.</p>
    <p>Curiously, it seemed to me that it took Ganelon's kisses at last to convince her I was Edward Bond....</p>
    <p>After that, for a few hours I slept, snug in Edward Bond's cavern rooms, in his comfortable bed, his guards watching beside the door. I slept with the memory of his sweet forest girl in my arms, and the prospect of his kingdom and his bride before me when I woke. I think in the Earth-world, Edward Bond must have dreamed jealous dreams.</p>
    <p>But my own dreams were bad. Llyr in his castle was awake and hungry, and the great, cold, writhing tendrils of his hunger coiled lazily through my mind as I slept. I knew they stirred through every mind in the Dark World that had senses to perceive them. I knew I must wake soon, or never. But first I must sleep and grow strong for the night's ordeal. Resolutely I shut Llyr from my thoughts, resolutely I shut away Aries.</p>
    <p>It was Medea's red smile and sidelong sultry glance that went down with me into the caverns of slumber.</p>

     <p>XI. In Ghast Rhymi's Tower</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>QUIETLY Lorryn and I crouched among the trees and looked out at the Castle of the Coven, aglitter with lights against the starry sky. This was the night! We both knew it, and we were both tense and sweating with a nervous exultation that made this waiting hard indeed.</p>
    <p>All around us in the woods, unseen, we heard the tiny sounds that meant an army of forest people waited our signal. And this time they were here in force. I caught a glint of starlight now and then on rifle-barrels, and I knew that the rebels were armed to put up a good fight against the soldiers of the Coven.</p>
    <p>Not, perhaps, too good a fight.</p>
    <p>I did not care. They thought they were going to storm the Castle and the Coven by sheer force of arms. I knew their only purpose was to divert attention while I made my way into the Castle and found the secret weapons that would give me power over the Covenanters. While they were striking, I would make my way to Ghast Rhymi and learn what was essential for me to learn.</p>
    <p>After that, I did not care. Many foresters would die. Let them. There would still be slaves aplenty for me when my hour came. And nothing could stop me now. The Norns fought with me; I could not fail....</p>
    <p>There was much activity within the Castle. Voices floated out to us in the still night air. Figures moved to and fro against the lights. Then great gates were flung open upon a burst of golden radiance and the outlines of many riders crowded against it. A procession was coming out.</p>
    <p>I heard chains clash musically, and I understood. This time the sacrifices rode chained to their mounts, so that no siren voices from the wood could lure them away. I shrugged. Let them go to their death, then. Llyr must be fed while he lasted. Better these than Ganelon, offered at the Golden Window. We saw them go off down the dark road, their chains ringing.</p>
    <p>That was Matholch -- there on the tall horse. I knew his vulpine outlines, the lift of the cloak upon his shoulders. And I would have known him too because of the great start, quickly checked, that Lorryn made beside me. I heard the breath whistle through his nostrils, and his voice grated in my ear.</p>
    <p>"Remember! That is mine!"</p>
    <p>Edeyrn went by, tiny on her small mount, and a breath of chill seemed to me to sweep the darkness as she passed.</p>
    <p>Medea came!</p>
    <p>When I could no longer make out her outlines in the distance, when her white robe was no more than a shimmer and her scarlet cloak had melted into the dark, I turned to Lorryn, my mind spinning, my plans already chaotic with change. For a new compulsion had come upon me, and I was not even trying to resist it.</p>
    <p>I had not seen a sacrifice in Caer Secaire. This was one of the blank places in my memory, and a dangerous blank. Until Ganelon remembered the Sabbat, until he watched Llyr accept the offerings through the Golden Window, he could not wholly trust himself to fight the Coven and Llyr. This was a gap that must be filled. And curiosity was suddenly very strong upon me. Curiosity -- and could it be -- the pull of Llyr?</p>
    <p>"Lorryn, wait for me here," I whispered in the darkness. "We've got to make sure they enter Caer Secaire, start the Sabbat. I don't want to attack until I'm sure. Wait for me." He stirred protestingly, but I was away before he could speak.</p>
    <p>I was out upon the road and running softly and silently after that processional winding toward the valley and the Mass of St. Secaire, which is the Black Mass. It seemed to me as I ran that the fragrance of Medea's perfume hung upon the air I breathed, and my throat choked with the passion of my hatred for her, and of my love.</p>
    <p>"She shall be the first to die," I promised myself in the dark....</p>
    <p>I watched the great iron doors of Caer Secaire swing shut upon the last of the procession. The Caer was dark inside. They went quietly in, one by one, and vanished into the deeper night within. The doors clanged resonantly after them.</p>
    <p>Some memory of Ganelon's, buried beneath the surface of conscious thought, urged me to the left, around the curve of the great wall. I followed the impulse obediently, moving almost like a sleep-walker toward a goal I did not know. Memory took me close under the looming rampart, made me lay my hands on its surface. There were heavy scrollings of pattern there, writhing like tendrils over the dark walls. My remembering fingers traced the curves, though my mind still wondered.</p>
    <p>Then the wall moved beneath my hands. The scroll-work had been a key of sorts, and a door sank open in the blackness before me. I went confidently forward, out of black night, through a black door into deeper blackness within. But my feet knew the way.</p>
    <p>A stairway rose beneath me in the dark. My feet had expected it and I did not stumble. It was very curious to move so blindly through this strange and dangerous place, not knowing where or why I moved, yet trusting my body to find the way. The stairs wound up and up.</p>
    <p>Llyr was here. I could feel his hungry presence like a pressure on the mind, but many times intensified because of the narrow spaces within these walls, as if he were a sound of thunder reverberating again and again from the enclosed spaces of the Caer. Something within me reverberated soundlessly in answer, a roar of exultation that I suppressed in quick revolt.</p>
    <p>Llyr and I were no longer linked by that ceremony of long ago. I repudiated it. I was not Llyr's Chosen now. But within me a sense I could not control quivered with ecstasy at the thought of those sacrifices who had fled blindly through the great doors of Caer Secaire. And I wondered if the Coven -- if Medea -- thought of me now, who had so nearly stood with the sacrifices last night.</p>
    <p>My feet paused upon the stairs. I could see nothing, but I knew that before me was a wall carved with scroll-patterns. My hands found it, traced the raised designs. A section of darkness slid sidewise and I was leaning upon a wide ledge, looking down, very far down.</p>
    <p>Caer Secaire was like a mighty grove of columns whose capitals soared up and up into infinite darkness. Somewhere above, too high for me to see its source, a light was beginning to glow. My heart paused when I saw it, for I knew that light -- mat golden radiance from a Golden Window.</p>
    <p>Memory came fitfully back to me. The Window of Llyr. The Window of Sacrifice. I could not see it, but my mind's eye remembered its glow. In Caer Llyr that Window's substance shone eternally, and Llyr Himself lolled behind it -- far behind it -- forever. But in Caer Secaire and in the other temples of sacrifice that had once dotted the Dark World, there were replicas of the Window which glowed only when Llyr came bodilessly through the dark to take his due.</p>
    <p>Above us, hovering and hungry, Llyr was dawning now in that golden radiance, like a sun in the night time of the temple. Where the Window of Secaire was located, how it was shaped, I still could not remember. But something in me knew that golden light and shivered in response as I watched its brilliance strengthen through the columns of the temple.</p>
    <p>Far below me I saw the Coven standing, tiny figures foreshortened to wedges of colored cloak -- green-robed Matholch, yellow-robed Edeyrn, red Medea. Behind them stood a circle of guardsmen. Before them, as I watched, the last of the chosen slaves moved blindly away among the columns. I could not see where they were going, but in essence I knew. The Window was yawning for its sacrifices, and somehow they must make their way to it.</p>
    <p>As the light broadened, I saw that before the Coven stood a great cup-shaped altar, black on a black dais. Above it a lipped spout hung. My eyes traced the course of the trough which ended in the spout, and I saw now that there was a winding, descending curve, dark against that growing light, which came down in a great sweep from the mysterious heights overhead, stretching from -- the Window? -- to the cupped altar. A stir deep within me told me what that trough was for. I leaned upon the sill, shaking with an anticipation that was half for myself and half for Him, who hovered above us in the sun-like dawning of golden light.</p>
    <p>Thinly from below me rose a chant. I knew Medea's voice, clear and silver, a thread of sound in the dimness and the silence. It rose like incense, quivering among the mighty, topless columns of Secaire.</p>
    <p>A tenseness of waiting grew and grew in the dim air of the temple. The figures below me stood motionless, heads lifted, watching the dawning light. Medea's voice chanted on and on.</p>
    <p>Time paused there in the columned grove of Secaire, while Llyr hovered above us waiting for her prey.</p>
    <p>Then a thin and terrible cry rang out from the heights overhead. One scream. The light shot out blindingly in a great burst of exultation, like a voiceless answering cry from Llyr Himself. Medea's chant rose to a piercing climax and paused.</p>
    <p>There was a stir among the columns; something moved along that curve of trough. My eyes sought the altar and the lipped spout above it.</p>
    <p>The Coven was rigid, a cluster of frozen figures, waiting.</p>
    <p>Blood began to drip from the spout.</p>
    <p>I do not know how long I hung there on the ledge, my eyes riveted to the altar. I do not know how many times I heard a cry ring out from above, how many times Medea's chant rose to a hungry climax as the light burst forth in a glory overhead and blood gushed into the great cup of the altar. I was deaf and blind to everything but this. I was half with Llyr at his Golden Window, shaken with ecstasy as he took his sacrifices, and half with the Coven below, glorying in their share of the ceremony of the Sabbat.</p>
    <p>But I know I waited too long.</p>
    <p>What saved me I do not know now. Some voice of the ego crying unheard in my mind that this was time dangerously spent, that I must be elsewhere before the Sabbat ended, that Lorryn and his men waited endlessly while I hung here battening like a glutton upon Llyr's feast.</p>
    <p>Reluctantly awareness returned to my mind. With an infinite effort I pulled myself back from the brink of that Golden Window and stood reeling in the darkness, but in my own body again, not hovering mindlessly with Llyr in the heights above. The Coven was still tense below me, gripped in the ecstasy of the sacrifice. But for how long I could not be sure. Perhaps for the rest of the night; perhaps for only an hour. I must hurry, if hurrying were not already futile. There was no way to know.</p>
    <p>So I went back in the darkness, down the unseen stairs, and out of the dark, unseen door, and back along the road to Coven Castle, my mind still reeling with remembered ecstasy, the glow of the Window still before my dazzled eyes, and the scarlet runnel above the altar, and the thin, sweet chanting of Medea louder in my ears than the sound of my own feet upon the road....</p>
    <p>The red moon was far down the sky when I came back to Lorryn, still crouching beside the castle wall and half mad with impatience. There was an eager stir among the unseen soldiers as I came running down the road, a forward surge as if they had waited to the very limit of endurance and would attack now whether I gave the word or no.</p>
    <p>I waved to Lorryn while I was still twenty feet away. I was careless now of the Castle guardsmen. Let them see me. Let them hear.</p>
    <p>"Give the signal!" I shouted to Lorryn. "Attack!"</p>
    <p>I saw him start up beside the road, and the moonlight glinted upon the silver horn he lifted to his lips. Its blare of signal notes ripped the night to tatters. It ripped away the last of my lethargy too.</p>
    <p>I heard the long yell that swept the forest as the woodsmen surged forward to the attack, and my own voice roared unbidden in reply, an ecstasy of battle-hunger that matched the ecstasy I had just shared with Llyr.</p>
    <p>The rattle of rifle-fire drowned out our voices. The first explosions of grenades shook the Castle, outlining the outer walls in livid detail. There were shouts from within, wild trumpetings of signal horns, the cries of confused guardsmen, leaderless and afraid. But I knew they would rally. They had been trained well enough by Matholch and by myself. And they had weapons that could give the woodsmen a stiff fight.</p>
    <p>When they recovered from this panic there would be much blood spilled around the outer walls.</p>
    <p>I did not wait to see it. The first explosions had breached the barriers close beside me, and I scrambled recklessly through the gap, careless of the rifle fire that spattered against the stones. The Morns were with me tonight. I bore a charmed life, and I knew I could not fail.</p>
    <p>Somewhere above me in the besieged towers Ghast Rhymi sat wrapped in his chill indifference, aloof as a god above the struggle around Coven Castle. I had a rendezvous with Ghast Rhymi, though he did not know it yet.</p>
    <p>I plunged into the gateway of the Castle, heedless of the milling guards. They did not know me in the darkness and the confusion, but they knew by my tunic I was not a forester, and they let me shoulder them aside.</p>
    <p>Three steps at a time, I ran up the great stairway.</p>

     <p>XII. Harp of Satan</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>CASTLE of the Coven! How strange it looked to me as I went striding through its halls. Familiar, yet curiously unknown, as though I saw it through the veil of Edward Bond's transplanted memories.</p>
    <p>So long as I went rapidly, I seemed to know the way. But if I hesitated, my conscious mind took over control, and that mind was still clouded with artificial memories, so that I became confused in the halls and corridors which were familiar to me when I did not think directly of them.</p>
    <p>It was as if whatever I focused on sharply receded into unfamiliarity while everything else remained clear, until I thought of it.</p>
    <p>I strode down hallways arched overhead and paved underfoot in bright, intricate mosaics that told legendary tales half-familiar to me. I walked upon centaurs and satyrs whose very faces were well known to the Ganelon half of my mind, while the Edward Bond half wondered in vain whether such people had really lived in this distorted world of mutations.</p>
    <p>This double mind at times was a source of strength to me, and at others a source of devouring weakness. Just now I hoped fervently that I might meet no delays for once I lost this rushing thread of memory which was leading me toward Ghast Rhymi, I might never find it again. Any interruption might be fatal to my plans.</p>
    <p>Ghast Rhymi, my memories told me, would be somewhere in the highest tower of the castle. There too would be the treasure-room where the Mask and Wand lay hidden, and hidden deeper in the serene, untouchable thoughts of Ghast Rhymi, lay the secret of Llyr's vulnerability.</p>
    <p>These three things I must have, and the getting would not be easy. For I knew -- without clearly remembering how or by what -- that the treasure-room was guarded by Ghast Rhymi. The Coven would not have left open to all comers that secret place where the things that could end them lay hidden.</p>
    <p>Even I, even Ganelon, had a secret thing locked in that treasury. For no Covenanter, no warlock, no sorceress can deal in the dark powers without creating, himself, the one instrument that can destroy him. That is the Law.</p>
    <p>There are secrets behind it which I may not speak of, but the common one is clear. All Earth's folklore is rife with the same legend. Powerful men and women must focus their power in an object detached from themselves.</p>
    <p>The myth of the external soul is common to all Earth races, but the reason for it lies deep in the lore of the Dark World. This much I can say -- that there must be a balance in all things. For every negative, a positive. We of the Coven could not build up our power without creating a corresponding weakness somewhere, somehow, and we must hide that weakness so cunningly that no enemy could find it.</p>
    <p>Not even the Coven knew wherein my own secret lay. I knew Medea's, and I knew Edeyrn's only partially, and as for Matholch -- well, against him I needed only my own Covenanter strength. Ghast Rhymi did not matter. He would not bother to fight.</p>
    <p>But Llyr? Ah!</p>
    <p>Somewhere the Sword lay hidden, and he who could find and use it in that unknown way for which it was fashioned, he held the existence of Llyr in his own hand. But there was danger. For as Llyr's power in the Dark World was beyond imagination, so too must be that balancing power hidden in the Sword. Even to go near it might be fatally dangerous. To hold it in the hand -- well, hold it I must, and there was no profit in thinking about danger.</p>
    <p>I went up and up, on and on.</p>
    <p>I could not hear the sounds of battle. But I knew that at the gate the Coven guards and slaves were fighting and falling, as Lorryn's men, too, were falling. I had warned Lorryn that none must break through his lines to warn those at Caer Secaire. I knew that he would follow that order, despite his anxiety to come to grips with Matholch. For the rest, there was one in the Castle who could, without stirring, send a message to Medea. One person!</p>
    <p>He had not sent that message. I knew that as I thrust through the white curtain and came out into the tower room. The little chamber was semicircular, walls, floor and ceiling were ivory pale. The casement windows were shut, but Ghast Rhymi had never needed sight to send out his vision.</p>
    <p>He sat there, an old, old man, relaxed amid the cushions of his seat, snowy hair and beard falling in curled ringlets that blended with his white, plain robe. His hands lay upon the chair-arms, pale as wax, so transparent that I could almost trace the course of the thinned blood that stirred so feebly in those old veins.</p>
    <p>Wick and wax had burned down. The flame of life flickered softly, and a wind might send that flame into eternal darkness. So sat the Ancient of Days, his blind blue gaze not seeing me, but turned upon inward things.</p>
    <p>Ganelon's memories flooded back. Ganelon had learned much from Ghast Rhymi. Even then, the Covenanter had been old. Now the tides of time had worn him, as the tides of the sea wear a stone till nothing is left but a thin shell, translucent as clouded glass.</p>
    <p>Within Ghast Rhymi I could see the life-fires dwindling, sunk to embers, almost ash.</p>
    <p>He did not see me. Not easily can Ghast Rhymi be drawn back from, the deeps where his thoughts move.</p>
    <p>I spoke to him, but he did not answer.</p>
    <p>I went past him then, warily, toward the wall that divided the tower-top into two halves. There was no sign of a door, but I knew the combination. I moved my palms in an intricate pattern on the cool surface, and a gap widened before me.</p>
    <p>I crossed the threshold.</p>
    <p>Here were kept the holy things of the Coven.</p>
    <p>I looked upon that treasure-vault with new eyes, clearer because of Edward Bond's memories. That lens, burning with dull amber lights there in its hollowed place in the wall -- I had never wondered much about it before. It killed. But memories of Earth-science told me why. It was not magic, but an instantaneous drainage of the electrical energy of the brain. And that conical black device -- that, killed, too. It could shake a man to pieces, by shuttling his life-force back and forth so rapidly between artificial cathode and anode that living flesh could not stand the strain. Alternating current, with variations!</p>
    <p>But these weapons did not interest me now. I sought other loot. There was no death-traps to beware of, for none but the Coven knew the way to enter this treasure-room, or its location, or even that it existed, save in legends. And no slave or guard would have dared to enter Ghast Rhymi's tower.</p>
    <p>My gaze passed over a sword, but not the one I needed; a burnished shield; a harp, set with an intricate array of manual controls. I knew that harp. Earth has legends of it -- the harp of Orpheus, that could bring back the dead from Hades. Human hands could not play it. But I was not quite ready for the harp, yet.</p>
    <p>What I wanted lay on a shelf, sealed in its cylindrical case. I broke open the seals and took out the thin black rod with its hand-grip.</p>
    <p>The Wand of Power. The Wand that could tap the electromagnetic force of a planet. So could other wands of this type -- but this was the only one without the safety-device that limited its power. It was dangerous to use.</p>
    <p>In another case I found the Crystal Mask -- a curved, transparent plate that shielded my eyes like a domino mask of glass. This mask would shield one from Edeyrn.</p>
    <p>I searched further. But of the Sword of Llyr I could find no trace.</p>
    <p>Time did not lag. I heard nothing of the noise of battle, but I knew that the battle went on, and I knew, too, that sooner or later the Coven would return to the Castle. Well, I could fight the Coven now, but I could not fight Llyr. I dared not risk the issue till I had made sure.</p>
    <p>In the door of the vault I stood, staring at Ghast Rhymi's silvery head. Whatever guardian thought he kept here, knew I had a right to the treasure room. He made no motion. His thoughts moved far out in unimaginable abysses, nor could they be easily drawn back. And it was impossible to put pressure on Ghast Rhymi. He had the perfect answer. He could die.</p>
    <p>Well, I too had an answer!</p>
    <p>I went back to the vault and lifted the harp. I carried it out and set it down before the old man. No life showed in his blue stare.</p>
    <p>I went to the windows and flung them open. Then I returned, dropping to the cushions beside the harp, and lightly touched its intricate controls.</p>
    <p>That harp had been in the Earth-world, or others like it. Legends know its singing strings, as legends tell of mystic swords. There was the lyre of Orpheus, strong with power, that Jupiter placed amid the stars. There was the harp of Gwydion of Britain, that charmed the souls of men. And the harp of Alfred, that helped to crush Daneland. There was David's harp that he played before Saul.</p>
    <p>Power rests in music. No man today can say what sound broke the walls of Jericho, but once men knew.</p>
    <p>Here in the Dark World this harp had its legends among the common folk. Men said that a demon played it, that the airy fingers of elemental spirits plucked at its strings. Well, in a way they were right.</p>
    <p>For an incredible perfection of science had created this harp. It was a machine. Sonic, sub-sonic, and pure vibration to match the thought-waves emitted by the brain blended into a whole that was part hypnosis and part electric magnetism. The brain is a colloid, a machine, and any machine can be controlled.</p>
    <p>And the harp of power could find the key to a mind, and lay bonds upon that mind.</p>
    <p>Through the open windows, faintly from below, I heard the clash of swords and the dim shouts of fighting men. But these sounds did not touch Ghast Rhymi. He was lost on the plane of pure abstraction, thinking his ancient, deep thoughts.</p>
    <p>My fingers touched the controls of the harp, awkwardly at first, then with more ease as manual dexterity came back with memory.</p>
    <p>The sigh of a plucked string whispered through the white room. The murmuring of minor notes, in a low, dreamily distant key. And as the machine found the patterns of Ghast Rhymi's mind, under my hands the harp quickened into breathing life.</p>
    <p>The soul of Ghast Rhymi -- translated into terms of pure music!</p>
    <p>Shrill and ear-piercing a single note sang.' Higher and higher it mounted, fading into inaudibility. Deep down a roaring, windy noise began, rising and swelling into the demon-haunted shout of a gale. Rivers of air poured their music into the threnody.</p>
    <p>High -- high -- cold and pure and white as the snowy summit of a great mountain, that single thin note sang and sang again.</p>
    <p>Louder grew the great winds. Rippling arpeggios raced through the rising torrent of the sorcerous music.</p>
    <p>Thunder of riven rocks -- shrill screaming of earthquake-shaken lands -- yelling of a deluge that poured down upon tossing forests.</p>
    <p>A heavy humming note, hollow and unearthly, and I saw the gulfs between the worlds where the empty night of space makes a trackless desert.</p>
    <p>And suddenly, incongruously, a gay lilting tune, with an infectious rocking rhythm, that brought to my mind bright colors and sunlit streams and fields.</p>
    <p>Ghast Rhymi stirred.</p>
    <p>For an instant awareness came back into his blue eyes. He saw me.</p>
    <p>And I saw the life-fires sink within that frail, ancient body.</p>
    <p>I knew that he was dying -- that I had troubled his long peace -- that he had relinquished his casual hold upon life.</p>
    <p>I drew the harp toward me. I touched the controls.</p>
    <p>Ghast Rhymi sat before me, dead, the faintest possible spark fading within that old brain.</p>
    <p>I sent the sorcerous spell of the harp blowing like a mighty wind upon the dying embers of Ghast Rhymi's life.</p>
    <p>As Orpheus drew back the dead Eurydice from Pluto's realm, so I cast my net of music, snared the soul of Ghast Rhymi, drew him back from death!</p>
    <p>He straggled at first, I felt his mind turn and writhe, trying to escape, but the harp had already found the key to his mind, and it would not let him go. Inexorably it drew him.</p>
    <p>The ember flickered -- faded -- brightened again.</p>
    <p>Louder sang the strings. Deeper roared the tumult of shaking waters.</p>
    <p>Higher the white, shrill note, pure as a star's icy light, leaped and ever rose.</p>
    <p>Roaring, racing, sweet with honey-musk, perfumed with flower-scent and ambergris, blazing with color, opal and blood-ruby and amethyst-blue, that mighty tapestry of color rippled and shook like a visible web of magic through the room.</p>
    <p>The web reached out.</p>
    <p>Swept around Ghast Rhymi like a fowler's snare!</p>
    <p>Back in those faded blue eyes the light of awareness grew. He had stopped struggling. He had given up the fight. It was easier to come back to life -- to let me question him -- than to battle the singing strings that could cage a man's very soul.</p>
    <p>Under the white beard the old man's lips moved.</p>
    <p>"Ganelon," he said. "I knew -- when the harp sang -- who played it. Well, ask your questions. And then let me die. I would not live in the days that are coming now. But you will live, Ganelon -- and yet you will die too. That much I have read in the future."</p>
    <p>The hoary head bent slowly. For an instant Ghast Rhymi listened -- and I listened too.</p>
    <p>The last, achingly sweet notes of the harp died upon the trembling air.</p>
    <p>Through the open windows came the muted clash of sword and the wordless shriek of a dying man.</p>

     <p>XIII. War -- Red War!</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>PITY FLOODED me. The shadow of greatness that had cloaked Ghast Rhymi was gone. He sat there, a shrunken, fragile old man, and I felt a momentary unreasoning impulse to turn on my heel and leave him to drift back into his peaceful abyss of thought. Once, I remembered, Ghast Rhymi had seemed a tall, huge figure -- though he had never been that in my lifetime. But in my childhood I had sat at the feet of this Covenanter and looked up with awe at that majestic, bearded face with reverence.</p>
    <p>Perhaps there had been more life in that face then, more warmth and humanity. It was remote now. It was like the face of a god, or of one who had looked upon too many gods.</p>
    <p>My tongue stumbled.</p>
    <p>"Master," I said. "I am sorry!"</p>
    <p>No light came into the distant blue gaze, yet I sensed a stirring.</p>
    <p>"You name me master?" he said. "You -- Ganelon? It has been a long time since you humbled yourself to anyone."</p>
    <p>The taste of my triumph was ashes. I bowed my head. Yes, I had conquered Ghast Rhymi, and I did not like the savor of that conquest.</p>
    <p>"In the end the circle completes itself," the old man said quietly. "We are more kin than the others. Both you and I are human, Ganelon, not mutants. Because I am Leader of the Coven I let Medea and the others use my wisdom. But -- but -- " He hesitated.</p>
    <p>"For two decades my mind has dwelt in shadow," he went on. "Beyond good and evil, beyond life and the figures that move like puppets on the stream of life. When I was wakened, I would give the answers I knew. It did not matter. I had thought that I had lost all touch with reality. And that if death swept over every man and woman in the Dark World, it would not matter."</p>
    <p>I could not speak. I knew that I had done Ghast Rhymi a very great wrong in wakening him from his deep peace.</p>
    <p>The blue stars dwelt on me.</p>
    <p>"And I find that it does matter, after all. No blood of mine runs in your veins, Ganelon. Yet we are kin. I taught you, as I would have taught my own son. I trained you for your task -- to rule the Coven in my place. And now, I think I regret many things. Most of all the answer I gave the Covenanters after Medea brought you back from Earth-world."</p>
    <p>"You told them to kill me," I said.</p>
    <p>He nodded.</p>
    <p>"Matholch was afraid. Edeyrn sided with him. They made Medea agree. Matholch said, 'Ganelon is changed. There is danger. Let the old man read the future and see what it holds.' So they came to me, and I let my mind ride the winds of time and see what lay ahead."</p>
    <p>"And that was --?"</p>
    <p>"The end of the Coven," Ghast Rhymi said. "If you lived. I foresaw the arms of Llyr reaching into the Dark World, and Matholch lying dead in a shadowed place, and doom upon Edeyrn and Medea. For time is fluid, Ganelon. It changes as men change. The probabilities alter. When you went into Earth-world, you Were Ganelon. But you came back with a double mind. You have the memories of Edward Bond, which you can use as tools. Medea should have left you in Earth-world. But she loved you."</p>
    <p>"Yet she agreed to let them kill me," I said.</p>
    <p>"Do you know what was in her thoughts?" Ghast Rhymi asked. "In Caer Secaire, at the time of sacrifice, Llyr would come. And you have been sealed to Llyr. Did Medea think you could be killed, then?"</p>
    <p>A doubt grew within me. But Medea had led me, like a sheep to slaughter, in the procession to the Caer. If she could justify herself, let her. I knew that Edeyrn and Matholch could not.</p>
    <p>"I may let Medea live, then," I said. "But not the wolfling. I have already promised his life. And as for Edeyrn, she must perish."</p>
    <p>I showed Ghast Rhymi the Crystal Mask. He nodded.</p>
    <p>"But Llyr?"</p>
    <p>"I was sealed to Him as Ganelon," I said. "Now you say I have two minds. Or, at least, an extra set of memories, even though they are artificial. I am not willing to be liege to Llyr! I learned many things in the-Earth-world. Llyr is no god!"</p>
    <p>The ancient head bent. A transparent hand rose and touched the ringlets of the beard. Then Ghast Rhymi looked at me, and he smiled.</p>
    <p>"So you know that, do you?" he asked. "I will tell you something, Ganelon, that no one else has guessed. You are not the first to come from Earth-world to the Dark World. I was the first."</p>
    <p>I stared at him with unconcealed amazement.</p>
    <p>"And you were born in the Dark World; I was not," he said. "My flesh sprang from the dust of Earth. It has been very long since I crossed, and I can never return now, for my span is long outlived. Only here can I keep the life-spark burning within me, though I do not much care about that either. Yet I am Earth-born, and I knew Vortigern and the kings of Wales. I had my own holdings at Caer-Merdin, and a different sun from this red ember in the Dark World's sky shone upon Caer-Merdin! Blue sky, blue sea of Britain, the gray stones of the Druid altars under the oak forests. That is my home, Ganelon. Was my home. Until my science, that men in those days called magic, brought me here, with a woman's aid. A Dark-World woman named Viviane."</p>
    <p>"You are Earth-born?" I said.</p>
    <p>"Once -- yes. As I grew older here, very, very old, I regretted my exile. I had acquired enough of wisdom. I would have changed it all for one breath of the cool, sweet air that blew in from the Irish Sea when I was a boy. But never could I return. My body would fall to dust in the Earth-world. So I lost myself in dreams -- dreams of Earth, Ganelon."</p>
    <p>His blue eyes brightened with memories.</p>
    <p>His voice deepened.</p>
    <p>"In my dreams I brought back the old days. I stood again on the crags of Wales, watching the salmon leaping in the waters of gray Usk. I saw Artorius again, and his father Uther, and I smelled the old smells of Britain in her youth. But they were dreams!</p>
    <p>"And dreams are not enough. For the sake of the love I bore the dust from which I sprang, for the sake of a wind that blew from ancient Ireland, I will help you now, Ganelon. I had never thought that life would matter to me any more. But that these abominations should lead a man of Earth to slaughter -- no! And man of Earth you are now, though born on this world of sorcery!"</p>
    <p>He leaned forward, compelling me with his gaze.</p>
    <p>"You are right. Llyr is no god. He is -- a monster. No more than that. And he can be slain."</p>
    <p>"With the Sword Called Llyr?"</p>
    <p>"Listen. Put these legends out of your mind. That is Llyr's power, and the power of the Dark World. All is veiled in mystic symbols of terror. But behind the veil lies simple truth. Vampire, werewolf, upas-tree -- they all are biological freaks, mutations run wild! And the First mutation was Llyr. His birth split the one time-world into two, each spinning along its line of probability. He was a key factor in the temporal pattern of entropy.</p>
    <p>"Listen again. At birth, Llyr was human. But his mind was not as the minds of others. He had certain natural powers, latent powers, which ordinarily would not have developed in the race for a million years. Because they did develop in him too soon, they were warped and distorted, and put to evil ends. In the future world of logic and science, his mental powers would have fitted. In the dark times of superstition, they did not fit too well. So he developed, with the science at his command and the mental strength he had, into a monster.</p>
    <p>"Human once. Less human as he grew older and wiser in his alien knowledge. In Caer Llyr are machines which send out certain radiations necessary to the existence of Llyr. Those radiations permeate the Dark World. They have caused other mutations, such as Matholch and Edeyrn and Medea.</p>
    <p>"Kill Llyr and his machines will stop. The curse of abnormal mutations will be lifted. The shadow over this planet will be gone."</p>
    <p>"How may I kill Him?" I asked.</p>
    <p>"With the Sword Called Llyr. His life is bound up with that Sword, as a machine is dependent on its parts. I am not certain of the reason for this, Ganelon, but Llyr is not human -- now. He is part machine and part pure energy and part something unimaginable. But he was born of flesh, and he must maintain his contact with the Dark World, or die. The Sword is his contact."</p>
    <p>"Where is the Sword?"</p>
    <p>"At Caer Llyr," Ghast Rhymi said. "Go there. By the altar, there is a crystal pane. Don't you remember?"</p>
    <p>"I remember."</p>
    <p>"Break that pane. Then you will find the Sword Called Llyr."</p>
    <p>He sank back. His eyes closed, then opened again.</p>
    <p>I knelt before him and he made the Ancient Sign above me.</p>
    <p>"Strange," he murmured, half to himself. "Strange that I should send a man to battle again, as I sent so many, long ago."</p>
    <p>The white head bent forward. Snowy beard lay upon the snowy robe.</p>
    <p>"For the sake of a wind that blew from Ireland," the old man whispered.</p>
    <p>Through the open windows a breath of air drifted, gently ruffling the white ringlets of hair and beard....</p>
    <p>The winds of the Dark World stirred in the silent room, paused -- and were gone!</p>
    <p>Now, indeed, I stood alone....</p>
    <p>From Ghast Rhymi's chamber I went down the tower steps and into the courtyard.</p>
    <p>The battle was nearly over. Scarcely a score of the Castle's defenders were still on their feet. Around them Lorryn's pack ravened and yelled. Back to back, grimly silent, the dead-eyed guardsmen wove their blades in a steel mesh that momentarily held at bay their attackers.</p>
    <p>There was no time to be wasted here. I caught sight of Lorryn's scarred face and made for him. He showed me his teeth in a triumphant grin.</p>
    <p>"We have them, Bond."</p>
    <p>"It took you long enough," I said. "These dogs must be slain quickly!" I caught a sword from a nearby woodsman.</p>
    <p>Power flowed up the blade and into the hilt -- into me.</p>
    <p>I plunged into the thick of the battle. The foresters made way for me. Beside me Lorryn laughed quietly.</p>
    <p>Then I came face to face with a guardsman. His blade swung up in thrust and parry, and I twisted aside, so that his steel sang harmlessly through the air. My sword-point leaped like a striking snake for his throat. The shock of metal grating on bone jarred my wrist.</p>
    <p>I tore the weapon free and glimpsed Lorryn, still grinning, engaging another of the guardsmen.</p>
    <p>"Kill them!" I shouted. "Kill them!"</p>
    <p>I did not wait for response. I went forward against the blind-eyed soldiers of Medea, slashing, striking, thrusting, as though these men were the Coven, my enemies! I hated each blankly staring face. Red tides of rage began to surge up, narrowing my vision and clouding my mind with hot mists.</p>
    <p>For a few moments, I was drunk with the lust for killing.</p>
    <p>Lorryn's hands gripped my shoulders. His voice came.</p>
    <p>"Bond! Bond!"</p>
    <p>The fogs were swept away. I stared around. Not one of the guardsmen was left alive. Bloody, hacked corpses lay sprawled on the gray flagstone of the courtyard. The woodsmen, panting hard, were wiping their blades clean.</p>
    <p>"Did any escape to carry warning to Caer Secaire?" I asked.</p>
    <p>Despite his perpetual scarred grin, Lorryn looked troubled.</p>
    <p>"I'm not sure. I don't think so, but the place is a rabbit-warren."</p>
    <p>"The harm's done then," I said. "We hadn't enough men to throw a cordon around the Castle."</p>
    <p>He grimaced. "Warned or not, what's the odds? We can slay the Covenanters as we killed their guards."</p>
    <p>"We ride to Caer Llyr," I said, watching him.</p>
    <p>I saw the shadow of fear in the cold gray eyes. Lorryn rubbed his grizzled beard and scowled.</p>
    <p>"I don't understand. Why?"</p>
    <p>"To kill Llyr."</p>
    <p>Amazement battled with ancient superstitious terror in his face. His gaze searched mine and apparently read the answer he wanted.</p>
    <p>"To kill -- that!"</p>
    <p>I nodded. "I've seen Ghast Rhymi. He told me the way."</p>
    <p>The men around us were watching and listening. Lorryn hesitated.</p>
    <p>"We didn't bargain for this," he said. "Yet by the gods! To kill Llyr!</p>
    <p>Suddenly he sprang into action, shouting orders. Swords were sheathed. Men ran to untether the mounts. Within minutes we were in our saddles, riding out from the courtyard, the shadow of the Castle falling heavily upon us till the moon lifted above the tallest tower.</p>
    <p>I rose in my stirrups and looked back. Up there, dead, sat Ghasti Rhymi, first of the coven to die by my hand. I had killed him as surely as if I had plunged steel into his heart.</p>
    <p>I dropped back into the saddle, pressing heels into my horse's flanks. He bolted forward. Lorryn urged his steed level with me. Behind us the woodsmen strung out in a long uneven line as we galloped across the low hills toward the distant mountains. It would be dawn before we could reach Caer Llyr. And there was no time to waste.</p>
    <p>Medea and Edeyrn and Matholch! The names of the three beat like muffled drums in my brain. Traitors to me, Medea no less than the others, for had she not bent before the wills of Edeyrn and Matholch, had she not been willing to sacrifice me? Death I would give Edeyrn and the wolfling. Medea I might let live, but only as my slave, nothing more.</p>
    <p>With Ghast Rhymi dead, I was leader of the Coven! In the old man's tower, sentimental weakness had nearly betrayed me. The weakness of Edward Bond, I thought. His memories had watered my will and diluted my power.</p>
    <p>Now I no longer needed his memories. At my side swung the Crystal Mask and the Wand of Power. I knew how to get the Sword Called Llyr. It was Ganelon and not the weakling Edward Bond, who would make himself master of the Dark World.</p>
    <p>Briefly I wondered where Bond was now. When Medea had brought me through the Need-fire to the Dark World, Edward Bond, at that same moment, must have returned to Earth. I smiled ironically, imagining the surprise that must have been his. Perhaps he had tried, and was still trying, to get back to the Dark World. But without Freydis to aid him, his attempts would be useless. Freydis was helping me now, not Bond.</p>
    <p>And Bond would stay on Earth! The substitution would not occur again if I could help it. And I could help it. Strong Freydis might be, but could she stand against the man who had killed Llyr? I did not think so.</p>
    <p>I sent a sly sidewise glance at Lorryn. Fool! Aries too was another of the same breed. Only Freydis had sense enough not to trust me.</p>
    <p>The strongest of my enemies must die first -- Llyr. Then the Coven. After that, the woodsmen would taste my power. They would learn, that I was Ganelon, not the Earth weakling, Edward Bond!</p>
    <p>I thrust the memories of Bond out of my mind. I drove them away. I banished them utterly.</p>
    <p>As Ganelon I would battle Llyr.</p>
    <p>And as Ganelon I would rule the Dark World!</p>
    <p>Rule -- with iron and fire!</p>

     <p>XIV. Fire of Life</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>HOURS BEFORE we came to Caer Llyr we saw it, at first a blacker blackness against the night sky, and slowly, gradually, deepening into an ebon mountain as the rose-gray dawn spread behind us.</p>
    <p>Our cantering shadows fell before us, to be trodden under the horses' hoofs. Cool, fresh winds whispered -- whispered of the sacrifice at Caer Secaire, of the seeking minds of the Coven that spied across the land.</p>
    <p>But Caer Llyr loomed on the edge of darkness ahead -- guarding the night!</p>
    <p>Huge the Caer was, and alien. It seemed shapeless, a Titan mound of jumbled black rock thrown almost casually together. Yet I knew that there was design in its strange geometry.</p>
    <p>Two jet pillars, each fifty feet tall, stood like the legs of a colossus, and between them was an unguarded portal. Only there was mere any touch of color about the Caer.</p>
    <p>A veil of flickering rainbows played lambently, like a veil across the threshold. Opalescent and faintly glowing, the shadow-curtain swung and quivered as though gentle winds drifted through gossamer folds of silk.</p>
    <p>Fifty feet high was that curtain and twenty feet broad. Straddling it the ebon pillars rose. And above and beyond, towering breathtakingly to the dawn-clouded sky, squatted the Caer, a mountain-like structure that had never been built by man.</p>
    <p>From Caer Llyr a breath of fear came coldly, scattering the woodsmen like leaves before a gale. They broke ranks, deployed out and drew together again as I raised my hand and Lorryn called a command.</p>
    <p>I stared around at the low hills surrounding us.</p>
    <p>"Never in my memory or my father's memory have men come this close to Caer Llyr," Lorryn said. "Except for Covenanters, of course. Nor would the foresters follow me now, Bond. They follow you."</p>
    <p>How far would they follow? My wondering thought was cut off as a woodsman shouted warning. He rose in his stirrups and pointed south.</p>
    <p>Over the hills, riding like demons in a dusty cloud, came horsemen, their armor glittering in the red sunlight!</p>
    <p>"So someone did escape from the Castle," I said between my teeth. "And the Coven have been warned, after all!"</p>
    <p>Lorryn grinned and shrugged. "Not many."</p>
    <p>"Enough to delay us." I frowned, trying to make the best plan. "Lorryn, stop them. If the Coven ride with then- guards, kill them too. But hold them back from the Caer until --"</p>
    <p>"Until?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know. I'll need time. How much time I can't say. Battling and conquering Llyr won't be the work of a moment."</p>
    <p>"Nor is it the work of one man," Lorryn said doubtfully. "With us to aid you, victory will fly at your elbow."</p>
    <p>"I know the weapon against Llyr," I said. "One man can wield it. But keep the guardsmen back, and the Covenanters too. Give me time!"</p>
    <p>"There will be no difficulty about that," Lorryn said, a flash of excitement lighting his eyes. "For look!"</p>
    <p>Angling across the hills, riding one by one into view, hotly pursuing the armored rout, came green-clad figures, spurring their horses forward.</p>
    <p>Those figures were woodsmen's women whom we had left behind in the valley. They were armed now, for I saw the glitter of swords. Nor were swords their only weapons. A spiteful crack echoed, a puff of smoke arose, and one of the guardsmen flung up his hands and toppled from his mount.</p>
    <p>Edward Bond had known how to make rifles! And the woodsfolk had learned how to use them!</p>
    <p>At the head of the woods women I noted two lithe forms, one a slim, supple girl whose ashy-blond hair streamed behind her like a banner. Aries.</p>
    <p>And at her side, on a great white steed, rode one whose giant form I could not mistake even from this distance. Freydis spurred forward like a Valkyrie galloping into battle.</p>
    <p>Freydis and Aries, and the women of the forest!</p>
    <p>Lorryn's laugh held exultation.</p>
    <p>"We have them, Bond!" he cried, his fist tightening on the rein. "Our women at their heels, and we to strike from the flank -- we'll catch and crush them between hammer and anvil. Gods grant the shape-changer rides there!"</p>
    <p>"Then ride," I snapped. "No more talk! Ride and crush them. Hold them back from the Caer!"</p>
    <p>With that I raced my steed forward, lying low on the horse's mane, driving like a thunderbolt toward the black mountain ahead. Did Lorryn know how suicidal might be the mission on which I had sent him? Matholch he might slay, and even Medea. But if Edeyrn rode with the Coven guards, if ever she dropped the hood from her face, neither sword nor bullet could save the woodsmen!</p>
    <p>Still they would give me time. And if the woodsmen's ranks were thinned, so much the better for me later. I would deal with Edeyrn in my own way when the time came.</p>
    <p>Ahead the black columns stood. Behind me a shouting rose, and a crackle of rifle-fire. I looked back, but a fold of the hills hid the combat from my eyes.</p>
    <p>I sprang from the horse's back and stood before the pillars -- between them. The coruscating veil sparkled and ran like milky water before me. Above, towering monstrously, stood the Caer, the focus of the evil that had spread across the Dark World.</p>
    <p>And in it reposed Llyr, my enemy!</p>
    <p>I still had the sword I had taken from one of the woodsmen, but I doubted if ordinary steel would be much good within the Caer. Nevertheless I made sure the weapon was at my side as I walked forward.</p>
    <p>I stepped through the veil.</p>
    <p>For twenty paces I moved forward in utter darkness. Then light came.</p>
    <p>But it was the light that beats upon a snow plain, so bright, so glittering, that it blinds. I stood motionless, waiting. Presently the dazzle resolved itself into flickering atoms of brightness, weaving and darting in arabesque patterns. Not cold, no!</p>
    <p>Tropical warmth beat upon me.</p>
    <p>The shining atoms drove at me. They tingled upon my face and hands. They sank like intangible things through my garments and were absorbed by my skin. They did not lull me. Instead, my body greedily drank that weird snowstorm of -- energy? -- and was in turn energized by it.</p>
    <p>Tide of life sang ever stronger in my veins.</p>
    <p>I saw three gray shadows against the white. Two tall and one slight and small as a child's shadow.</p>
    <p>I knew them. I knew who cast them.</p>
    <p>I heard Matholch's voice.</p>
    <p>"Kill him. Kill him now."</p>
    <p>And Medea's answer.</p>
    <p>"No. He need not die. He must not."</p>
    <p>"But he must!" Matholch snarled, and Edeyrn's sexless, thin voice echoed his.</p>
    <p>"He is dangerous, Medea. He must die, and only on Llyr's altar can he be slain. For he is the Sealed of Llyr."</p>
    <p>"He need not die," Medea said stubbornly. "If he is made harmless -- weaponless -- he may live."</p>
    <p>"How?" Edeym asked, and for answer the red witch stepped forward out of the dazzling white shimmer.</p>
    <p>No longer a shadow. No longer a two-dimensional grayness. She stood before me -- Medea, witch of Colchis.</p>
    <p>Her dark hair fell to her knees. Her dark gaze slanted at me. Evil she was, and alluring as Lilith.</p>
    <p>I dropped my hand to sword-hilt.</p>
    <p>I did not. I could not move. Faster swirled the darting bright atoms, whirling about me, sinking into my body to betray me.</p>
    <p>I could not move.</p>
    <p>Beyond Medea the twin shadows bent forward.</p>
    <p>"The power of Llyr holds him," Edeyrn whispered. "But Ganelon is strong, Medea. If he breaks his fetters, we are lost."</p>
    <p>"By then he will have no weapons," Medea said, and smiled at me.</p>
    <p>Now indeed I knew my danger. Very easily my steel could have bitten through Medea's soft throat, and heartily I wished it had done so long ago. For I remembered Medea's power. The mutation that set her apart from others. That which had caused her to be named -- vampire.</p>
    <p>I remembered victims of hers that I had seen. The dead-eyed guardsmen, the Castle slaves, hollow shells of men, the walking dead, all soul drained from them, and most of their life-forms as well.</p>
    <p>Her arms stole around my neck. Her mouth lifted to mine.</p>
    <p>In one hand she held her black wand. It touched my head, and a gentle shock, not unpleasant, crawled along my scalp. The -- the conductor, I knew, and a gust of insane laughter shook me at the incongruity of the weapon.</p>
    <p>But there was no magic here. There was science, of a high order, a science made possible only for those who were trained to it, or for those who were mutants. Medea drank energy, but not through sorcery. I had seen that wand used too often to believe that.</p>
    <p>The wand opened the closed circuits of the mind and its energies. It tapped the brain, as a copper wire can tap a generated current.</p>
    <p>Diverting the life-force to Medea!</p>
    <p>The shining mist-motes swirled faster. They closed in around us, bathing us in a swirling cloak. The gray shadowiness fell away from Edeym and Matholch. Dun-cloaked, cowled dwarf and lean, grinning wolfling stood there, watching.</p>
    <p>Edeyrn's face I could not see, though the deadly cold crept from beneath the cowl like an icy wind. Matholch's tongue crept out and circled his lips. His eyes were bright with triumph and excitement.</p>
    <p>A numbing, lethargic languor was stealing over me. Against my mouth as Medea's lips grew hotter, more ardent, as my own lips chilled. Desperately I tried to move, to grasp my sword-hilt. I could not.</p>
    <p>Now the bright veil thinned again. Beyond Matholch and Edeyrn I could see a vast space, so enormous that my gaze failed to pierce its violet depths. A stairway led up to infinite heights.</p>
    <p>A golden glow burned high above.</p>
    <p>But behind Matholch and Edeyrn, a little to one side, stood a curiously-carved pedestal whose front was a single pane of transparent glass. It shone steadily with a cool blue light. What lay within I did not know, but I recognized that crystal pane.</p>
    <p>Ghast Rhymi had spoken of it. Behind it must lie the Sword Called Llyr.</p>
    <p>Faintly now -- faintly -- I heard Matholch's satisfied chuckle.</p>
    <p>"Ganelon, my love, do not struggle against me," Medea whispered. "Only I can save you. When your madness passes, we will return to the Castle."</p>
    <p>Yes, for I would be no menace then. Matholch would not bother to harm me. As a mindless, soulless thing I would return to the Castle of the Coven as Medea's slave.</p>
    <p>I, Ganelon, hereditary Lord of the Coven and the Sealed of Llyr!</p>
    <p>The golden glow high above brightened. Crooked lightnings rushed out from it and were lost in the violet dimness.</p>
    <p>My eyes found that golden light that was the Window of Llyr.</p>
    <p>My mind reached out toward it.</p>
    <p>My soul strained to it!</p>
    <p>Witch and vampire-mutation Medea might be -- or sorceress -- but she had never been sealed to Llyr. No dark power beat latently in her blood as it beat in mine. Well I knew now that, no matter how I might renounce my allegiance to Llyr, there yet had been a bond. Llyr had power over me, but I could draw upon his power as well!</p>
    <p>I drew on that power now!</p>
    <p>The golden window brightened. Again forked lightnings ran out from it and were gone. A muffled, heavy drum-beat muttered from somewhere, like the pulse of Llyr.</p>
    <p>Like the heart of Llyr, stirring from sleep to waking.</p>
    <p>Through me power rushed, quickening my flesh from its lethargy. I drew on Llyr's power without measuring the cost. I saw fear flash across Matholch's face, and Edeyrn made a quick gesture.</p>
    <p>"Medea," she said.</p>
    <p>But Medea had already sensed that quickening. I felt her body quiver convulsively against mine. Avidly she pressed against me, faster and faster she drank the energy that made me alive.</p>
    <p>But the energy of Llyr poured into me! Hollow thunders roared in the vast spaces above. The golden window blazed with dazzling brightness. And around us now the sparkling motes of light paled, shrank, and were gone.</p>
    <p>"Kill him!" Matholch howled. "He holds Llyr!"</p>
    <p>He sprang forward.</p>
    <p>From somewhere a bloody figure in dented armor stumbled. I saw Lorryn's scarred face twist in amazement as he blinked at the tableau. His sword, red to the hilt, was bare in his hand.</p>
    <p>He saw me with Medea's arms about my neck.</p>
    <p>He saw Edeyrn.</p>
    <p>And he saw Matholch!</p>
    <p>A wordless, inarticulate sound ripped through Lorryn's throat. He lifted high the sword.</p>
    <p>As I tore myself free from Medea's grip, as I sent her reeling away, I saw Matholch's wand come up. I reached for my own wand, but there was no need.</p>
    <p>Lorryn's blade sang. Matholch's hand, still gripping the wand, was severed at the wrist. Blood spurted from cut arteries.</p>
    <p>Howling, the shape-changer dropped forward. The lycanthropic change came upon him. Hypnotism, mutation, dark sorcery -- I could not tell. But the thing that sprang at Lorryn's throat was not human.</p>
    <p>Lorryn laughed. He sent his sword spinning away.</p>
    <p>He met the wolfling's charge, bracing himself strongly and caught the thing by throat and leg. Fanged jaws snapped viciously at him.</p>
    <p>Lorryn heaved the monster above his head. His joints cracked with the inhuman strain. One instant Lorryn stood there, holding his enemy high, while the wolf-jaws snarled and strove to rend him.</p>
    <p>He dashed the wolf down upon the stones!</p>
    <p>I heard bones snap like rotten twigs. I heard a scream of dying, terrible agony from a gaping muzzle from which blood poured.</p>
    <p>Then Matholch, in his own shape, broken, dying, lay writhing at our feet!</p>

     <p>XV. Lair of Power</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>MIRACULOUSLY the weakness that had chained me was, gone. Llyr's strength poured through me. I unsheathed my sword and ran past Matholch's body, ignoring Lorryn who stood motionless, staring down. I ran to the pedestal with its blue-litten pane.</p>
    <p>I gripped the sword's blade and sent the heavy hilt crashing against the glass.</p>
    <p>There was a tinkling of pizzicato notes, a singing of thin goblin laughter. The shards fell clashing at my feet.</p>
    <p>At my feet also dropped a sword. A sword of crystal, nearly five feet long -- pommel and guard and blade all of clearest glass.</p>
    <p>It had been part of the window. For within the hollow pedestal was nothing at all. The sword had been part of the pane, so that my breaking the crystal had released the weapon from its camouflaged hiding-place.</p>
    <p>Along the sleek blade blue light ran. Within the crystal blue fires burned wanly. I bent and picked up the sword. The hilt was warm and alive.</p>
    <p>The Sword Called Llyr in my left hand, the sword with blade of steel in my right, I stood upright.</p>
    <p>Paralyzing cold breathed past me.</p>
    <p>I knew that cold.</p>
    <p>So I did not turn. I swung the steel sword under my arm, snatched the Crystal Mask from my belt, and donned it. I drew the Wand of Power.</p>
    <p>Only then did I turn.</p>
    <p>Through the Mask queer glimmers and shiftings ran, distorting what I saw. The properties of light were oddly altered by the Mask. But it had its purpose. It was a filter.</p>
    <p>Matholch lay motionless now. Beyond his body Medea was rising to her feet, her dark hair disordered. Facing me stood Lorryn, a stone man, only his eyes alive in his set, white face.</p>
    <p>He was staring at Edeyrn, whose sleek dark head I saw. Her back was toward me. The cowl had been flung back upon her shoulders.</p>
    <p>Lorryn sagged down, the life going out of him. Bonelessly as water he collapsed.</p>
    <p>He lay dead.</p>
    <p>Then slowly, slowly, Edeym turned.</p>
    <p>She was tiny as a child, and her face was like a child's too, in its immature roundness. But I did not see her face, for even through the Crystal Mask burned the Gorgon's glare.</p>
    <p>The blood stilled within me. A slow tide of ice crept with iron lethargy into my brain and cold wariness engulfed me.</p>
    <p>Only in the eyes of the Gorgon fire burned:</p>
    <p>Deadly radiations were there, what Earth-scientists call ectogenetic rays, but limited till now to the plant-world. Only the mad mutation that had created Edeyrn could have brought from hell such a nightmare trick of biology.</p>
    <p>But I did not fall. I did not die. The radiations were filtered, made harmless, by the vibration-warping properties of the Mask I wore.</p>
    <p>I lifted the Wand of Power.</p>
    <p>Red fires blasted from it. Scarlet, licking tongues seared out toward Edeyrn.</p>
    <p>Lashes of flame tore at her, like crimson whips that burned and left bloody weals on that calm child-face.</p>
    <p>She drew back, the lance of her stare driving at me.</p>
    <p>With her, step by step, retreated Medea. Toward the foot of the great stairway that led to Llyr's Window.</p>
    <p>The whips of fire seared across her eyes.</p>
    <p>She turned and, stumbling, began to run up the stairway. Medea paused, her arms lifted in an uncompleted gesture. But in my face she read no softening.</p>
    <p>She, too, turned, and followed Edeyrn.</p>
    <p>I dropped the useless sword of steel. Wand in left hand, the Sword Called Llyr in my right, I followed them.</p>
    <p>As my foot touched the first step, a trembling vibration shook the violet air about me. Now almost I regretted having called upon Llyr to break Medea's spell. For Llyr was awake, watching, and warned.</p>
    <p>The pulse of Llyr muttered through the huge Caer. The golden lightnings flamed from the Window high above.</p>
    <p>Briefly two black small silhouettes showed against that amber glow. They were Edeyrn and Medea, climbing.</p>
    <p>After them I went. And at each step the way grew harder. I seemed to walk through a thickening, invisible torrent dot was like a wind or a wave flowing down from that shining window, striving to tear me from my foothold, to rip the crystal sword from my grip.</p>
    <p>Up and up I went. Now the Window was a glaring blaze of yellow fires. The lightnings crackled out incessantly, while rocking crashes of thunder reverberated along the vaulted abysses of the Caer. I leaned forward as though against a gale. Doggedly I fought my way up the stair.</p>
    <p>There was someone behind me.</p>
    <p>I did not turn. I dared not, for fear the torrent would sweep me from my place. I crawled up the last few steps, and came out on a level platform of stone, a disc-shaped dais, on which stood a ten-foot cube. Three of its sides were of black rock. The side that faced me was a glaring blaze of amber brilliance.</p>
    <p>Far below, dizzyingly far, was the floor of the Caer. Behind me the stairway ran down to those incredible depths, and the tremendous wind still blew upon me, pouring out from the Window, seeking to whirl me to my death.</p>
    <p>To the Window's left stood Edeyrn, to its right, Medea. And in the Window --</p>
    <p>The blazing golden clouds whirled, thickened, tossed like storm-mists, while still the blinding flashes spurted from them. The thunder never ceased now. But it pulsed. It rose and fell in steady cadence, in unison with the heart-beat of Llyr.</p>
    <p>Monster or mutation -- human once, or half-human -- Llyr had grown in power since then. Ghast Rhymi had warned me.</p>
    <p>Part machine and part pure energy and part something unthinkable, the power of Llyr blasted through the golden clouds upon me!</p>
    <p>The Wand of Power dropped from my hand. I lifted the crystal sword and managed one forward step. Then the helltide caught me, and I could advance no further. I could only fight, with every bit of my strength, against the avalanche that strove to thrust me toward the edge of the hanging platform.</p>
    <p>Louder grew the thunders. Brighter the lightnings flamed.</p>
    <p>The cold stare of Edeyrn chilled me. Medea's face was inhuman now. Yellow clouds boiled out from the Window and caught Edeyrn and Medea in their embrace.</p>
    <p>Then they rolled toward me and overwhelmed me.</p>
    <p>Dimly I could see the brighter glow that marked Llyr's Window. And two vague silhouettes, Edeyrn and Medea.</p>
    <p>I strove to step forward. Instead I was borne back toward the edge -- back and back.</p>
    <p>Great arms caught me about the waist. A braid of white hair tossed by my eyes. The giant strength of Freydis stood like a wall of iron between me and the abyss.</p>
    <p>From the corner of my eye I saw that she had wound a scrap torn from her white robe about her head, shielding her from the Gorgon's stare. Blindly, guided by some strange instinct, the Valkyrie thrust me forward.</p>
    <p>Against us the golden clouds rolled, sentient, palpable, veined with white lightnings and shaking with deep thunders.</p>
    <p>Freydis strove silently. I bent forward like a bow, battering against the torrent.</p>
    <p>Step by step I won forward, Freydis to aid me. Ever she stood as a bulwark against my back. I could hear her panting breath, great gasps that ripped from her throat as she linked her strength with mine.</p>
    <p>My chest felt as though a white-hot core of iron was driven through it. Yet I went on. Nothing existed now but that golden brightening amid the clouds, clouds of creation, sentient with the shaking tumult of breaking universes, worlds beyond worlds crashing into ruin under the power of Llyr....</p>
    <p>I stood before the Window.</p>
    <p>Without volition my arm swept up. I brought the Sword Called Llyr smashing down upon Llyr's Window.</p>
    <p>In my hand the sword broke.</p>
    <p>It fell to tinkling fragments at my feet. The veined blue glimmers writhed and coiled about the broken blade.</p>
    <p>Were sucked into the Window.</p>
    <p>Back rushed the cloud-masses. A tremendous, nearly unbearable vibration ripped through the Caer, shaking it like a sapling. The golden clouds were drawn through the Window.</p>
    <p>With them went Edeyrn and Medea!</p>
    <p>One glimpse I had of them, the brand of my fire like a red mask across Edeyrn's eyes, Medea's face despairing and filled with a horror beyond life, her gaze fixed on me with an imploring plea that was infinitely terrible. Then they vanished!</p>
    <p>For one instant I saw through the Window. I saw something beyond space and time and dimension, a writhing, ravening chaos that bore down upon Medea and Edeyrn and a golden core of light that I knew for Llyr.</p>
    <p>Once almost human, Llyr, at the end, bore no relation to anything remotely human.</p>
    <p>The grinding millstones of Chaos crushed the three!</p>
    <p>The thunder died.</p>
    <p>Before me stood the altar of Llyr. But it held no Window, now. All four sides were of black, dead stone!</p>

     <p>XVI. Self Against Self</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>blackness and black stones were the last things I saw, before dark oblivion closed down over me like folding wings. It was as if Llyr's terrible resistance was all that had held me upright in the last fierce stages of our struggle. As he fell, so fell Ganelon at the foot of the Windowless altar.</p>
    <p>How long I lay there I do not know. But slowly, slowly Caer Llyr came back around me, and I knew I was lying prostrate upon the altar. I sat up painfully, the dregs of exhaustion still stiffening my body, though I knew-I must have slept, for that exhaustion was no longer the overwhelming tide that had flooded me as I fell.</p>
    <p>Beyond me, at the head of the great steep of stairs, Freydis lay, half stretched upon the steps as if she had striven to return to her people in the moment before collapsing. Her eyes were still bound, and her mighty arms lay flung out upon the platform, all strength drained from them by the fierceness of our battle. Strangely, as she lay there, she brought back to my double-minded memories the thought of a figure from Earth -- another mighty woman in white robes, with bandaged eyes and upraised arms, blind Justice holding her eternal scales.</p>
    <p>Faintly I smiled at the thought. In the Dark World -- my world, now -- Justice was Ganelon, and not blind.</p>
    <p>Freydis stirred. One hand lifted uncertainly to the cloth across her eyes. I let her waken. Presently we must struggle again together, Justice and I. But I did not doubt who would prevail.</p>
    <p>I rose to my knees, and heard a silvery tinkling as something slid in fragments from my shoulder. The Mask, broken when I fell. Its crystal shards lay among those other shards which had blasted Llyr from the Dark World when the Sword broke. I thought of the strange blue lightnings which had wrought at last what no other thing in the Dark World could accomplish -- Llyr's destruction. And I thought I understood.</p>
    <p>He had passed too far beyond this world ever to touch it except in the ceremonies of the Golden Window. Man, demon, god, mutation into namelessness -- whatever he had been, he had kept but one link with the Dark World which spawned him. A link enshrined in the Sword Called Llyr. By that talisman he could return for the sacrifices which fed him, return for the great ceremonies of the Sealing that had made me half his own. But only by that talisman.</p>
    <p>So it must be safely hidden to be his bridge for the returning. And safely hidden it was. Without Ghast Rhymi's knowledge, who could have found it? Without the strength of the great Lord Ganelon -- well, yes, and the strength of Freydis too -- who could have won close enough to the window to shatter the Sword upon the only thing in the Dark World that could break it? Yes, Llyr had guarded his talisman as strongly as any guard could. But vulnerable he was, to the one man who could wield that Sword.</p>
    <p>So the Sword broke, and the bridge between worlds broke, and Llyr was gone into a chaos from which there could never be a returning.</p>
    <p>Medea, too -- red witch of Colchis, lost love, drinker of life, gone beyond recalling....</p>
    <p>For a moment I closed my eyes.</p>
    <p>"Well, Ganelon?"</p>
    <p>I looked up. Freydis was smiling grimly at me from beneath the uplifted blindfold. I rose to my feet and watched in silence while she got to hers. Triumph flooded through me in great waves of intoxicating warmth. The world I had just wakened to was wholly mine now, and not this woman nor any other human should balk me of my destiny. Had I not vanquished Llyr and slain the last of the Coven? And was I not stronger in magic than any man or woman now who walked the Dark World? I laughed, the deep sound echoing from the high vaults about us and rolling back in reverberant exultation until that which had been Caer Llyr was alive with the noise of my mirth. But Llyr was here no longer.</p>
    <p>"Let this be Caer Ganelon!" I said, hearing the echo of my own name come rolling back as if the castle itself replied.</p>
    <p>"Ganelon!" I shouted. "Caer Ganelon!" I laughed to hear the whole vast hollow repeating my name. While the echoes still rolled I spoke to Freydis.</p>
    <p>"You have a new master now, you forest people! Because you helped me you shall be rewarded, old woman, but I am master of the Dark World -- I Ganelon!" And the walls roared back to me, "Ganelon -- Ganelon!"</p>
    <p>Freydis smiled.</p>
    <p>"Not so fast, Covenanter," she said calmly. "Did you think I trusted you?"</p>
    <p>I gave her a scornful smile, "What can you do to me now? Only one thing could slay me before today -- Llyr Himself. Now Llyr is gone, and Ganelon is immortal! You have no power to touch me, sorceress!"</p>
    <p>She straightened on the step, her ageless face a little below mine. There was a sureness in her eyes that sent the first twinge of uneasiness into my mind. Yet what I had said was true for no one in the Dark World could harm me, now. Yet Freydis' smile did not waver.</p>
    <p>"Once I sent you through limbo into the Earth World," she said. "Could you stop me if I sent you there again?"</p>
    <p>Relief quieted my tremor of unease.</p>
    <p>"Tomorrow or the next day -- yes, I could stop you. Today, no. But I am Ganelon now, and I know the way back. I am Ganelon, and forewarned, and I think you could not so easily send me Earthward again, naked of memories and clothed in another man's past. I remember and I could return. You would waste your time and mine, Freydis. Yet try it, if you will and I warn you, I should be back again before your spell was finished."</p>
    <p>Her quiet smile did not falter. She folded her arms, hiding her hands in the flowing sleeves. She was very sure of herself.</p>
    <p>"You think you are a godling, Ganelon," she said. "You think no mortal power can touch you now. You have forgotten one thing. As Llyr had his weakness, as Edeyrn did, and Medea and Matholch so have you, Covenanter. In this world there is no man to match you. But in the Earth World there is, Lord Ganelon! In that world your equal lives, and I mean to call him out to fight one last battle for the freedom of the Dark World. Edward Bond could slay you, Ganelon!"</p>
    <p>I felt the blood leave my face, a little wind of chill like Edeyrn's glance breathed over me. I had forgotten. Even Llyr, by his own unimaginable hand, could have died. And I could die by my own hand too, or by the hand of that other self who was Edward Bond.</p>
    <p>"Fool!" I said. "Dotard! Have you forgotten that Bond and I can never stand in the same world? When I came, he vanished out of this land, just as I must vanish if you bring him here. How can a man and his reflection ever come hand to hand? How could he touch me, old woman?"</p>
    <p>"Easily," she smiled. "Very easily. He cannot fight you here, nor in the Earth World. That is true. But limbo, Ganelon? Have you forgotten limbo?"</p>
    <p>Her hands came out of her sleeves. There was a rod of blinding silver in each. Before I could stir she had brought the rods together, crossing them before her smiling face. At the intersection forces of tremendous power blazed into an instant's being, forces that streamed from the poles of the world and could touch only for the beat of a second if that world were not to be shaken into fragments. I felt the building reel below me.</p>
    <p>I felt the gateway open.</p>
    <p>Here was grayness, nothing but oblivion made visible all around me. I staggered with the suddenness of it, the shock, and the terrible tide of anger that came surging up through my whole body at the knowledge of Freydis' trickery. It was not to be endured, this magicking of the Dark World's lord! I would fight my way back and the vengeance I would wreak upon Freydis would be a lesson to all.</p>
    <p>Out of the grayness a mirror loomed before me. A mirror? I saw my own face, bewildered, uncomprehending, staring back into my eyes. But I was not wearing the ragged blue garments of sacrifice which I had donned so many aeons ago in the Castle of the Coven. I seemed to wear Earth garments, and I seemed not quite myself, not quite Ganelon. I seemed --</p>
    <p>"Edward Bond!" said the voice of Freydis behind me.</p>
    <p>The reflection of myself glanced across my shoulder, and a look of recognition and unutterable relief came over it.</p>
    <p>"Freydis!" he cried, in my own voice. "Freydis, thank God! I've tried so hard --"</p>
    <p>"Wait," Freydis stopped him. "Listen. There is one last trial before you. This man is Ganelon. He has undone all your work among the forest people. He has slain Llyr and the Coven. There is none in the Dark World to stay his hand if he wins his way back to it. Only you can stop him, Edward Bond. Only you."</p>
    <p>I did not wait for her to say anything more. I knew what must be done. I lunged forward before he could speak or stir, and drove a heavy blow into the face that might have been my own. It was a strange thing to do. It was a hard thing. At the last moment my muscles almost refused me, for it was as if I struck myself.</p>
    <p>I saw him reel back, and my own head reeled in imagination, so that the first blow rocked us both.</p>
    <p>He caught himself a dozen feet away and stood for a moment, unsteady on his feet, looking at me with a confusion that might have been the mirror of my own face, for I knew there was confusion there too.</p>
    <p>Then anger flushed those bewildering, familiar features, and I saw blood break from the corner of his mouth and trickle across his chin. I laughed savagely. That blood, somehow, made him my enemy. I had seen the blood of enemies, springing out in the wake of my blows, too often to mistake him now for anything but what he was. Myself -- and my deadliest foe.</p>
    <p>He dropped into a half-crouch and came for me, stooping to protect his body from my fists. I wished fervently for a sword or a gun. I have never cared for an equal fight, as Ganelon does not fight for sport, but to win. But this fight must be terribly, unbelievably equal.</p>
    <p>He dodged beneath my blow, and I felt the rocking jar of what seemed to be my own fist jolting against my cheekbone. He danced back, light-footed, out of range.</p>
    <p>Rage came snarling up in my throat. I wanted nothing of his boxing, this game fought by rules. Ganelon fought to win! I roared at him from the full depth of my lungs and hurled myself forward in a crushing embrace that carried us both heavily to the gray sponginess that was limbo's floor. My fingers sank delightfully in his throat. I groped savagely for his eyes. He grunted with effort and I felt his fist thud into my ribs, and felt the sharp white pain of breaking bone.</p>
    <p>So wholly was he myself, and I he, that for an instant I was not sure whose rib had snapped beneath whose blow. Then I drew a deep breath and sobbed it out again half finished as pain like bright light flashed through my body, and I knew it was my own rib.</p>
    <p>The knowledge maddened me. Careless of pain or caution, I drove my fists savagely into him at blind random, feeling exultantly the crackle of bone beneath my knuckles, the spurt of blood over my hard-clenched hands. We strove together in a terrible locked embrace, there upon the floor of limbo, in a nightmare that had no real being, except for the pain shooting through me after each breath.</p>
    <p>But in a moment or two, I knew somehow, very surely, that I was his master. And this is how I knew. He rolled half over to jab a hard blow into my face, and before the blow began, I had blocked it. I had known. He squirmed from beneath me and braced himself to strike me again in the ribs, and before he could strike, I had twisted sidewise away. Again I had known.</p>
    <p>For I had been Edward Bond once, in every way that matters. I had lived in his memory and his world. And I knew Edward Bond as I knew myself. Instinct seemed to tell me what he would do next. He could not out-think me, and so he could not hope to out-tight me, to whom his every thought was revealed in the moment before he could act upon it.</p>
    <p>Even in the pain of my broken rib, I laughed then. Freydis had overreached herself at last! In smothering Ganelon under Edward Bond's memories in the Earth World, she had given me the means to vanquish him now! He was mine, to finish when I chose, and the Dark World was mine, and Edward Bond's kingdom of free people was mine too, and Edward Bond's lovely pale-haired bride, and everything that might have been his own.</p>
    <p>I laughed exultantly, and twisted in three perfectly timed motions that blocked and overbalanced the man who was myself. Three motions only -- and then I had him across my knee, taut-stretched, his spine pressing hard against my thigh.</p>
    <p>I grinned down at him. My blood dripped into his face. I saw it strike there, and I met his eyes, and then strangely, for one flashing instant, I knew a fierce yearning for defeat. In that instant, I prayed voicelessly to a nameless god that Edward Bond might yet save himself, and Ganelon might die....</p>
    <p>I callled forth all the strength that was in me, and limbo swam redly before my eyes and the pain of my broken rib was a lance of white light as I drew the deep breath that was Edward Bond's last.</p>
    <p>I broke his back across, my knee.</p>

     <p>XVII. Freedom at Last!</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>HURRIEDLY TWO cold, smooth hands pressed hard upon my forehead. I looked up. They slid lower, covering my eyes. And weakness was like a blanket over me. I knelt there, unresisting, feeling the body of the man who had been myself slide limply from my knee.</p>
    <p>Freydis pressed me down. We lay side by side, the living and the dead.</p>
    <p>The silver rods of the sorceress touched my head, and made a bridge between Edward Bond and Ganelon. I remembered Medea's wand that could draw the life-force from the mind. A dull, numbing paralysis had me. Little tingling shocks rippled through my nerves, and I could not move.</p>
    <p>Sudden agonizing pain shot through me. My back! I tried to scream with the white fury of that wrenching agony, but my throat was frozen. I felt Edward Bond's wounds!</p>
    <p>In that nightmare moment, while my brain spun down the limitless corridors of a science beyond that of mankind, I knew what Freydis had done -- what she was doing.</p>
    <p>I felt the mind of Edward Bond come back from the gulfs. Side by side we lay in flesh, and side by side in spirit as well.</p>
    <p>There was blackness, and two flames, burning with a cold, clear fire....</p>
    <p>One was the mind -- the life -- of Edward Bond. One was my life!</p>
    <p>The flames bent toward each other!</p>
    <p>They mingled and were one!</p>
    <p>Life and soul and mind of Edward Bond merged with life of Ganelon!</p>
    <p>Where two flames had burned, there was one now. One only.</p>
    <p>And the identity of Ganelon ebbed, sank... faded into a graying shadow as the fires of Edward Bond's life leaped even higher!</p>
    <p>We were one. We were --</p>
    <p>Edward Bond! No longer Ganelon! No longer Lord of the Dark World, Master of the Caere!</p>
    <p>Magic of Freydis drowned the soul of Ganelon and gave his body to the life of Edward Bond!</p>
    <p>I saw Ganelon -- die!...</p>
    <p>When I opened my eyes again, I knelt upon the altar that had been Llyr's. The empty vaults towered hollowly above us. Limbo was gone. The body across my knee was gone. Freydis smiled down at me with her ageless, timeless smile.</p>
    <p>"Welcome back to the Dark World, Edward Bond."</p>
    <p>Yes, it was true. I knew that. I knew it was my own identity, housed though it was in another man's body. Dizzily I blinked, shook my head, and rose slowly. Pain struck savagely at my side, and I gasped and let Freydis spring forward to support me on one great white arm, while the hollow building reeled about me. But Ganelon was gone. He had vanished with limbo, vanished like a scatter of smoke, vanished as if the prayer he breathed in his extremity had been answered by the nameless god he prayed to.</p>
    <p>I was Edward Bond again.</p>
    <p>"Do you know why Ganelon could break you, Edward Bond?" Freydis said softly. "Do you know why you could not vanquish him? It was not what he thought. I know he believed he read your mind because he had dwelt there, but that was not the reason. When a man fights himself, my son, the same man does not fight to win. Only the suicide hates himself. Deep within Ganelon lay knowledge of his own evil, and the hatred of it. So he could strike his own image and exult in the blow, because he hated himself in the depths of his own mind.</p>
    <p>"But you had earned your own respect. You could not strike as hard as he because you are not evil. And Ganelon won -- and lost. In the end, he did not fight me. He had slain himself, and the man who does that has no combat left in him."</p>
    <p>Her voice sank to a murmur. Then she laughed.</p>
    <p>"Go out now, Edward Bond. There is much to be done in the Dark World!"</p>
    <p>So, leaning upon her arm, I went down the long steps that Ganelon had climbed. I saw the green glimmer of the day outside, the shimmer of leaves, the motion of waiting people. I remembered all that Ganelon had remembered, but upon the mind of Ganelon the mind of Edward Bond was forever superimposed, and I knew that only thus could the Dark World be ruled.</p>
    <p>The two together, twinned forever in one body, and the control forever mine -- Edward Bond's.</p>
    <p>We came out under the emptied arch of the opening, and daylight was blinding for a moment after that haunted darkness. Then I saw the foresters anxiously clustering in then- battered ranks around the Caer, and I saw a pale girl in green, haloed by her floating hair, turn a face of incredulous radiance to mine.</p>
    <p>I forgot the pain in my side.</p>
    <p>Aries' hair swam like mist about us both as my arms closed around her. The roar of exultation that went up from the forest people swept the clearing and made the great Caer behind us echo through all its hollow vaults.</p>
    <p>The Dark World was free, and ours.</p>
    <p>But Medea, Medea, red witch of Colchis, how we might have reigned together!</p>

    <p>Nicholas Martin looked up at the robot across the desk.</p>
    <p>"I'm not going to ask what you want," he said, in a low, restrained voice. "I already know. Just go away and tell St. Cyr I approve. Tell him I think it's wonderful, putting a robot in the picture. We've had everything else by now, except the Rockettes. But clearly a quiet little play about Christmas among the Portuguese fishermen on the Florida coast must have a robot. Only, why not six robots? Tell him I suggest a baker's dozen. Go away."</p>
    <p>"Was your mother's name Helena Glinska?" the robot asked.</p>
    <p>"It was not," Martin said.</p>
    <p>"Ah, then she must have been the Great Hairy One," the robot murmured.</p>
    <p>Martin took his feet off the desk and sat up slowly.</p>
    <p>"It's quite all right," the robot said hastily. "You've been chosen for an ecological experiment, that's all. But it won't hurt. Robots are perfectly normal life forms where I come from, so you needn't--"</p>
    <p>"Shut up," Martin said. "Robot indeed, you--you bit-player! This time St. Cyr has gone too far." He began to shake slightly all over, with some repressed but strong emotion. The intercom box on the desk caught his eye, and he stabbed a finger at one of the switches. "Get me Miss Ashby! Right away!"</p>
    <p>"I'm so sorry," the robot said apologetically. "Have I made a mistake? The threshold fluctuations in the neurons always upset my mnemonic norm when I temporalize. Isn't this a crisis-point in your life?"</p>
    <p>Martin breathed hard, which seemed to confirm the robot's assumption.</p>
    <p>"Exactly," it said. "The ecological imbalance approaches a peak that may destroy the life-form, unless ... mm-m. Now either you're about to be stepped on by a mammoth, locked in an iron mask, assassinated by helots, or--is this Sanskrit I'm speaking?" He shook his gleaming head. "Perhaps I should have got off fifty years ago, but I thought--sorry. Good-bye," he added hastily as Martin raised an angry glare.</p>
    <p>Then the robot lifted a finger to each corner of his naturally rigid mouth, and moved his fingers horizontally in opposite directions, as though sketching an apologetic smile.</p>
    <p>"No, don't go away," Martin said. "I want you right here, where the sight of you can refuel my rage in case it's needed. I wish to God I could get mad and stay mad," he added plaintively, gazing at the telephone.</p>
    <p>"Are you sure your mother's name wasn't Helena Glinska?" the robot asked. It pinched thumb and forefinger together between its nominal brows, somehow giving the impression of a worried frown.</p>
    <p>"Naturally I'm sure," Martin snapped.</p>
    <p>"You aren't married yet, then? To Anastasia Zakharina-Koshkina?"</p>
    <p>"Not yet or ever," Martin replied succinctly. The telephone rang. He snatched it up.</p>
    <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
    <p>"Hello, Nick," said Erika Ashby's calm voice. "Something wrong?"</p>
    <p>Instantly the fires of rage went out of Martin's eyes, to be replaced by a tender, rose-pink glow. For some years now he had given Erika, his very competent agent, ten percent of his take. He had also longed hopelessly to give her approximately a pound of flesh--the cardiac muscle, to put it in cold, unromantic terms. Martin did not; he put it in no terms at all, since whenever he tried to propose marriage to Erika he was taken with such fits of modesty that he could only babble o' green fields.</p>
    <p>"Well," Erika repeated. "Something wrong?"</p>
    <p>"Yes," Martin said, drawing a long breath. "Can St. Cyr make me marry somebody named Anastasia Zakharina-Koshkina?"</p>
    <p>"What a wonderful memory you have," the robot put in mournfully. "Mine used to be, before I started temporalizing. But even radioactive neurons won't stand--"</p>
    <p>"Nominally you're still entitled to life, liberty, et cetera," Erika said. "But I'm busy right now, Nick. Can't it wait till I see you?"</p>
    <p>"When?"</p>
    <p>"Didn't you get my message?" Erika demanded.</p>
    <p>"Of course not," Martin said, angrily. "I've suspected for some time that all my incoming calls have to be cleared by St. Cyr. Somebody might try to smuggle in a word of hope, or possibly a file." His voice brightened. "Planning a jailbreak?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, this is outrageous," Erika said. "Some day St. Cyr's going to go too far--"</p>
    <p>"Not while he's got DeeDee behind him," Martin said gloomily. Summit Studios would sooner have made a film promoting atheism than offend their top box-office star, DeeDee Fleming. Even Tolliver Watt, who owned Summit lock, stock and barrel, spent wakeful nights because St. Cyr refused to let the lovely DeeDee sign a long-term contract.</p>
    <p>"Nevertheless, Watt's no fool," Erika said. "I still think we could get him to give you a contract release if we could make him realize what a rotten investment you are. There isn't much time, though."</p>
    <p>"Why not?"</p>
    <p>"I told you--oh. Of course you don't know. He's leaving for Paris tomorrow morning."</p>
    <p>Martin moaned. "Then I'm doomed," he said. "They'll pick up my option automatically next week and I'll never draw a free breath again. Erika, do something!"</p>
    <p>"I'm going to," Erika said. "That's exactly what I want to see you about. Ah," she added suddenly, "now I understand why St. Cyr stopped my message. He was afraid. Nick, do you know what we've got to do?"</p>
    <p>"See Watt?" Nick hazarded unhappily. "But Erika--"</p>
    <p>"See Watt alone," Erika amplified.</p>
    <p>"Not if St. Cyr can help it," Nick reminded her.</p>
    <p>"Exactly. Naturally St. Cyr doesn't want us to talk to Watt privately. We might make him see reason. But this time, Nick, we've simply got to manage it somehow. One of us is going to talk to Watt while the other keeps St. Cyr at bay. Which do you choose?"</p>
    <p>"Neither," Martin said promptly.</p>
    <p>"Oh, Nick! I can't do the whole thing alone. Anybody'd think you were afraid of St. Cyr."</p>
    <p>"I am afraid of St. Cyr," Martin said.</p>
    <p>"Nonsense. What could he actually do to you?"</p>
    <p>"He could terrorize me. He does it all the time. Erika, he says I'm indoctrinating beautifully. Doesn't it make your blood run cold? Look at all the other writers he's indoctrinated."</p>
    <p>"I know. I saw one of them on Main Street last week, delving into garbage cans. Do you want to end up that way? Then stand up for your rights!"</p>
    <p>"Ah," said the robot wisely, nodding. "Just as I thought. A crisis-point."</p>
    <p>"Shut up," Martin said. "No, not you, Erika. I'm sorry."</p>
    <p>"So am I," Erika said tartly. "For a moment I thought you'd acquired a backbone."</p>
    <p>"If I were somebody like Hemingway--" Martin began in a miserable voice.</p>
    <p>"Did you say Hemingway?" the robot inquired. "Is this the Kinsey-Hemingway era? Then I must be right. You're Nicholas Martin, the next subject. Martin, Martin? Let me see--oh yes, the Disraeli type, that's it." He rubbed his forehead with a grating sound. "Oh, my poor neuron thresholds! Now I remember."</p>
    <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
    <p>"Nick, can you hear me?" Erika's voice inquired. "I'm coming over there right away. Brace yourself. We're going to beard St. Cyr in his den and convince Watt you'll never make a good screen-writer. Now--"</p>
    <p>"But St. Cyr won't ever admit that," Martin cried. "He doesn't know the meaning of the word failure. He says so. He's going to make me into a screen-writer or kill me."</p>
    <p>"Remember what happened to Ed Cassidy?" Erika reminded him grimly. "St. Cyr didn't make him into a screen-writer."</p>
    <p>"True. Poor old Ed," Martin said, with a shiver.</p>
    <p>"All right, then. I'm on my way. Anything else?"</p>
    <p>"Yes!" Martin cried, drawing a deep breath. "Yes, there is! I love you madly!"</p>
    <p>But the words never got past his glottis. Opening and closing his mouth noiselessly, the cowardly playwright finally clenched his teeth and tried again. A faint, hopeless squeak vibrated the telephone's disk. Martin let his shoulders slump hopelessly. It was clear he could never propose to anybody, not even a harmless telephone.</p>
    <p>"Did you say something?" Erika asked. "Well, good-bye then."</p>
    <p>"Wait a minute," Martin said, his eyes suddenly falling once more upon the robot. Speechless on one subject only, he went on rapidly, "I forgot to tell you. Watt and the nest-fouling St. Cyr have just hired a mock-up phony robot to play in Angelina Noel!"</p>
    <p>But the line was dead.</p>
    <p>"I'm not a phony," the robot said, hurt.</p>
    <p>Martin fell back in his chair and stared at his guest with dull, hopeless eyes. "Neither was King Kong," he remarked. "Don't start feeding me some line St. Cyr's told you to pull. I know he's trying to break my nerve. He'll probably do it, too. Look what he's done to my play already. Why Fred Waring? I don't mind Fred Waring in his proper place. There he's fine. But not in Angelina Noel. Not as the Portuguese captain of a fishing boat manned by his entire band, accompanied by Dan Dailey singing Napoli to DeeDee Fleming in a mermaid's tail--"</p>
    <p>Self-stunned by this recapitulation, Martin put his arms on the desk, his head in his hands, and to his horror found himself giggling. The telephone rang. Martin groped for the instrument without rising from his semi-recumbent position.</p>
    <p>"Who?" he asked shakily. "Who? St. Cyr--"</p>
    <p>A hoarse bellow came over the wire. Martin sat bolt upright, seizing the phone desperately with both hands.</p>
    <p>"Listen!" he cried. "Will you let me finish what I'm going to say, just for once? Putting a robot in Angelina Noel is simply--"</p>
    <p>"I do not hear what you say," roared a heavy voice. "Your idea stinks. Whatever it is. Be at Theater One for yesterday's rushes! At once!"</p>
    <p>"But wait--"</p>
    <p>St. Cyr belched and hung up. Martin's strangling hands tightened briefly on the telephone. But it was no use. The real strangle-hold was the one St. Cyr had around Martin's throat, and it had been tightening now for nearly thirteen weeks. Or had it been thirteen years? Looking backward, Martin could scarcely believe that only a short time ago he had been a free man, a successful Broadway playwright, the author of the hit play Angelina Noel. Then had come St. Cyr....</p>
    <p>A snob at heart, the director loved getting his clutches on hit plays and name writers. Summit Studios, he had roared at Martin, would follow the original play exactly and would give Martin the final okay on the script, provided he signed a thirteen-week contract to help write the screen treatment. This had seemed too good to be true--and was.</p>
    <p>Martin's downfall lay partly in the fine print and partly in the fact that Erika Ashby had been in the hospital with a bad attack of influenza at the time. Buried in legal verbiage was a clause that bound Martin to five years of servitude with Summit should they pick up his option. Next week they would certainly do just that, unless justice prevailed.</p>
    <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
    <p>"I think I need a drink," Martin said unsteadily. "Or several." He glanced toward the robot. "I wonder if you'd mind getting me that bottle of Scotch from the bar over there."</p>
    <p>"But I am here to conduct an experiment in optimum ecology," said the robot.</p>
    <p>Martin closed his eyes. "Pour me a drink," he pleaded. "Please. Then put the glass in my hand, will you? It's not much to ask. After all, we're both human beings, aren't we?"</p>
    <p>"Well, no," the robot said, placing a brimming glass in Martin's groping fingers. Martin drank. Then he opened his eyes and blinked at the tall highball glass in his hand. The robot had filled it to the brim with Scotch. Martin turned a wondering gaze on his metallic companion.</p>
    <p>"You must do a lot of drinking yourself," he said thoughtfully. "I suppose tolerance can be built up. Go ahead. Help yourself. Take the rest of the bottle."</p>
    <p>The robot placed the tip of a finger above each eye and slid the fingers upward, as though raising his eyebrows inquiringly.</p>
    <p>"Go on, have a jolt," Martin urged. "Or don't you want to break bread with me, under the circumstances?"</p>
    <p>"How can I?" the robot asked. "I'm a robot." His voice sounded somewhat wistful. "What happens?" he inquired. "Is it a lubricatory or a fueling mechanism?"</p>
    <p>Martin glanced at his brimming glass.</p>
    <p>"Fueling," he said tersely. "High octane. You really believe in staying in character, don't you? Why not--"</p>
    <p>"Oh, the principle of irritation," the robot interrupted. "I see. Just like fermented mammoth's milk."</p>
    <p>Martin choked. "Have you ever drunk fermented mammoth's milk?" he inquired.</p>
    <p>"How could I?" the robot asked. "But I've seen it done." He drew a straight line vertically upward between his invisible eyebrows, managing to look wistful. "Of course my world is perfectly functional and functionally perfect, but I can't help finding temporalizing a fascina--" He broke off. "I'm wasting space-time. Ah. Now. Mr. Martin, would you be willing to--"</p>
    <p>"Oh, have a drink," Martin said. "I feel hospitable. Go ahead, indulge me, will you? My pleasures are few. And I've got to go and be terrorized in a minute, anyhow. If you can't get that mask off I'll send for a straw. You can step out of character long enough for one jolt, can't you?"</p>
    <p>"I'd like to try it," the robot said pensively. "Ever since I noticed the effect fermented mammoth's milk had on the boys, it's been on my mind, rather. Quite easy for a human, of course. Technically it's simple enough, I see now. The irritation just increases the frequency of the brain's kappa waves, as with boosted voltage, but since electrical voltage never existed in pre-robot times--"</p>
    <p>"It did," Martin said, taking another drink. "I mean, it does. What do you call that, a mammoth?" He indicated the desk lamp.</p>
    <p>The robot's jaw dropped.</p>
    <p>"That?" he asked in blank amazement. "Why--why then all those telephone poles and dynamos and lighting-equipment I noticed in this era are powered by electricity!"</p>
    <p>"What did you think they were powered by?" Martin asked coldly.</p>
    <p>"Slaves," the robot said, examining the lamp. He switched it on, blinked, and then unscrewed the bulb. "Voltage, you say?"</p>
    <p>"Don't be a fool," Martin said. "You're overplaying your part. I've got to get going in a minute. Do you want a jolt or don't you?"</p>
    <p>"Well," the robot said, "I don't want to seem unsociable. This ought to work." So saying, he stuck his finger in the lamp-socket. There was a brief, crackling flash. The robot withdrew his finger.</p>
    <p>"F(t)--" he said, and swayed slightly. Then his fingers came up and sketched a smile that seemed, somehow, to express delighted surprise.</p>
    <p>"Fff(t)!" he said, and went on rather thickly, "F(t) integral between plus and minus infinity ... a-sub-n to e...."</p>
    <p>Martin's eyes opened wide with shocked horror. Whether a doctor or a psychiatrist should be called in was debatable, but it was perfectly evident that this was a case for the medical profession, and the sooner the better. Perhaps the police, too. The bit-player in the robot suit was clearly as mad as a hatter. Martin poised indecisively, waiting for his lunatic guest either to drop dead or spring at his throat.</p>
    <p>The robot appeared to be smacking his lips, with faint clicking sounds.</p>
    <p>"Why, that's wonderful," he said. "AC, too."</p>
    <p>"Y-you're not dead?" Martin inquired shakily.</p>
    <p>"I'm not even alive," the robot murmured. "The way you'd understand it, that is. Ah--thanks for the jolt."</p>
    <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
    <p>Martin stared at the robot with the wildest dawning of surmise.</p>
    <p>"Why--" he gasped. "Why--you're a robot!"</p>
    <p>"Certainly I'm a robot," his guest said. "What slow minds you pre-robots had. Mine's working like lightning now." He stole a drunkard's glance at the desk-lamp. "F(t)--I mean, if you counted the kappa waves of my radio-atomic brain now, you'd be amazed how the frequency's increased." He paused thoughtfully. "F(t)," he added.</p>
    <p>Moving quite slowly, like a man under water, Martin lifted his glass and drank whiskey. Then, cautiously, he looked up at the robot again.</p>
    <p>"F(t)--" he said, paused, shuddered, and drank again. That did it. "I'm drunk," he said with an air of shaken relief. "That must be it. I was almost beginning to believe--"</p>
    <p>"Oh, nobody believes I'm a robot at first," the robot said. "You'll notice I showed up in a movie lot, where I wouldn't arouse suspicion. I'll appear to Ivan Vasilovich in an alchemist's lab, and he'll jump to the conclusive I'm an automaton. Which, of course, I am. Then there's a Uighur on my list--I'll appear to him in a shaman's hut and he'll assume I'm a devil. A matter of ecologicologic."</p>
    <p>"Then you're a devil?" Martin inquired, seizing on the only plausible solution.</p>
    <p>"No, no, no. I'm a robot. Don't you understand anything?"</p>
    <p>"I don't even know who I am, now," Martin said. "For all I know, I'm a faun and you're a human child. I don't think this Scotch is doing me as much good as I'd--"</p>
    <p>"Your name is Nicholas Martin," the robot said patiently. "And mine is ENIAC."</p>
    <p>"Eniac?"</p>
    <p>"ENIAC," the robot corrected, capitalizing. "ENIAC Gamma the Ninety-Third."</p>
    <p>So saying, he unslung a sack from his metallic shoulder and began to rummage out length upon length of what looked like red silk ribbon with a curious metallic lustre. After approximately a quarter-mile of it had appeared, a crystal football helmet emerged attached to its end. A gleaming red-green stone was set on each side of the helmet.</p>
    <p>"Just over the temporal lobes, you see," the robot explained, indicating the jewels. "Now you just set it on your head, like this--"</p>
    <p>"Oh no I don't," Martin said, withdrawing his head with the utmost rapidity. "Neither do you, my friend. What's the idea? I don't like the looks of that gimmick. I particularly don't like those two red garnets on the sides. They look like eyes."</p>
    <p>"Those are artificial eclogite," the robot assured him. "They simply have a high dielectric constant. It's merely a matter of altering the normal thresholds of the neuron memory-circuits. All thinking is based on memory, you know. The strength of your associations--the emotional indices of your memories--channel your actions and decisions, and the ecologizer simply changes the voltage of your brain so the thresholds are altered."</p>
    <p>"Is that all it does?" Martin asked suspiciously.</p>
    <p>"Well, now," the robot said with a slight air of evasion. "I didn't intend to mention it, but since you ask--it also imposes the master-matrix of your character type. But since that's the prototype of your character in the first place, it will simply enable you to make the most of your potential ability, hereditary and acquired. It will make you react to your environment in the way that best assures your survival."</p>
    <p>"Not me, it won't," Martin said firmly. "Because you aren't going to put that thing on my head."</p>
    <p>The robot sketched a puzzled frown. "Oh," he said after a pause. "I haven't explained yet, have I? It's very simple. Would you be willing to take part in a valuable socio-cultural experiment for the benefit of all mankind?"</p>
    <p>"No," Martin said.</p>
    <p>"But you don't know what it is yet," the robot said plaintively. "You'll be the only one to refuse, after I've explained everything thoroughly. By the way, can you understand me all right?"</p>
    <p>Martin laughed hollowly. "Natch," he said.</p>
    <p>"Good," the robot said, relieved. "That may be one trouble with my memory. I had to record so many languages before I could temporalize. Sanskrit's very simple, but medieval Russian's confusing, and as for Uighur--however! The purpose of this experiment is to promote the most successful pro-survival relationship between man and his environment. Instant adaptation is what we're aiming at, and we hope to get it by minimizing the differential between individual and environment. In other words, the right reaction at the right time. Understand?"</p>
    <p>"Of course not," Martin said. "What nonsense you talk."</p>
    <p>"There are," the robot said rather wearily, "only a limited number of character matrices possible, depending first on the arrangement of the genes within the chromosomes, and later upon environmental additions. Since environments tend to repeat--like societies, you know--an organizational pattern isn't hard to lay out, along the Kaldekooz time-scale. You follow me so far?"</p>
    <p>"By the Kaldekooz time-scale, yes," Martin said.</p>
    <p>"I was always lucid," the robot remarked a little vainly, nourishing a swirl of red ribbon.</p>
    <p>"Keep that thing away from me," Martin complained. "Drunk I may be, but I have no intention of sticking my neck out that far."</p>
    <p>"Of course you'll do it," the robot said firmly. "Nobody's ever refused yet. And don't bicker with me or you'll get me confused and I'll have to take another jolt of voltage. Then there's no telling how confused I'll be. My memory gives me enough trouble when I temporalize. Time-travel always raises the synaptic delay threshold, but the trouble is it's so variable. That's why I got you mixed up with Ivan at first. But I don't visit him till after I've seen you--I'm running the test chronologically, and nineteen-fifty-two comes before fifteen-seventy, of course."</p>
    <p>"It doesn't," Martin said, tilting the glass to his lips. "Not even in Hollywood does nineteen-fifty-two come before fifteen-seventy."</p>
    <p>"I'm using the Kaldekooz time-scale," the robot explained. "But really only for convenience. Now do you want the ideal ecological differential or don't you? Because--" Here he flourished the red ribbon again, peered into the helmet, looked narrowly at Martin, and shook his head.</p>
    <p>"I'm sorry," the robot said. "I'm afraid this won't work. Your head's too small. Not enough brain-room, I suppose. This helmet's for an eight and a half head, and yours is much too--"</p>
    <p>"My head is eight and a half," Martin protested with dignity.</p>
    <p>"Can't be," the robot said cunningly. "If it were, the helmet would fit, and it doesn't. Too big."</p>
    <p>"It does fit," Martin said.</p>
    <p>"That's the trouble with arguing with pre-robot species," ENIAC said, as to himself. "Low, brutish, unreasoning. No wonder, when their heads are so small. Now Mr. Martin--" He spoke as though to a small, stupid, stubborn child. "Try to understand. This helmet's size eight and a half. Your head is unfortunately so very small that the helmet wouldn't fit--"</p>
    <p>"Blast it!" cried the infuriated Martin, caution quite lost between Scotch and annoyance. "It does fit! Look here!" Recklessly he snatched the helmet and clapped it firmly on his head. "It fits perfectly!"</p>
    <p>"I erred," the robot acknowledged, with such a gleam in his eye that Martin, suddenly conscious of his rashness, jerked the helmet from his head and dropped it on the desk. ENIAC quietly picked it up and put it back into his sack, stuffing the red ribbon in after it with rapid motions. Martin watched, baffled, until ENIAC had finished, gathered together the mouth of the sack, swung it on his shoulder again, and turned toward the door.</p>
    <p>"Good-bye," the robot said. "And thank you."</p>
    <p>"For what?" Martin demanded.</p>
    <p>"For your cooperation," the robot said.</p>
    <p>"I won't cooperate," Martin told him flatly. "It's no use. Whatever fool treatment it is you're selling, I'm not going to--"</p>
    <p>"Oh, you've already had the ecology treatment," ENIAC replied blandly. "I'll be back tonight to renew the charge. It lasts only twelve hours."</p>
    <p>"What!"</p>
    <p>ENIAC moved his forefingers outward from the corners of his mouth, sketching a polite smile. Then he stepped through the door and closed it behind him.</p>
    <p>Martin made a faint squealing sound, like a stuck but gagged pig.</p>
    <p>Something was happening inside his head.</p>

    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Nicholas Martin felt like a man suddenly thrust under an ice-cold shower. No, not cold--steaming hot. Perfumed, too. The wind that blew in from the open window bore with it a frightful stench of gasoline, sagebrush, paint, and--from the distant commissary--ham sandwiches.</p>
    <p>"Drunk," he thought frantically. "I'm drunk--or crazy!" He sprang up and spun around wildly; then catching sight of a crack in the hardwood floor he tried to walk along it. "Because if I can walk a straight line," he thought, "I'm not drunk. I'm only crazy...." It was not a very comforting thought.</p>
    <p>He could walk it, all right. He could walk a far straighter line than the crack, which he saw now was microscopically jagged. He had, in fact, never felt such a sense of location and equilibrium in his life. His experiment carried him across the room to a wall-mirror, and as he straightened to look into it, suddenly all confusion settled and ceased. The violent sensory perceptions leveled off and returned to normal.</p>
    <p>Everything was quiet. Everything was all right.</p>
    <p>Martin met his own eyes in the mirror.</p>
    <p>Everything was not all right.</p>
    <p>He was stone cold sober. The Scotch he had drunk might as well have been spring-water. He leaned closer to the mirror, trying to stare through his own eyes into the depths of his brain. For something extremely odd was happening in there. All over his brain, tiny shutters were beginning to move, some sliding up till only a narrow crack remained, through which the beady little eyes of neurons could be seen peeping, some sliding down with faint crashes, revealing the agile, spidery forms of still other neurons scuttling for cover.</p>
    <p>Altered thresholds, changing the yes-and-no reaction time of the memory-circuits, with their key emotional indices and associations ... huh?</p>
    <p>The robot!</p>
    <p>Martin's head swung toward the closed office door. But he made no further move. The look of blank panic on his face very slowly, quite unconsciously, began to change. The robot ... could wait.</p>
    <p>Automatically Martin raised his hand, as though to adjust an invisible monocle. Behind him, the telephone began to ring. Martin glanced at it.</p>
    <p>His lips curved into an insolent smile.</p>
    <p>Flicking dust from his lapel with a suave gesture, Martin picked up the telephone. He said nothing. There was a long silence. Then a hoarse voice shouted, "Hello, hello, hello! Are you there? You, Martin!"</p>
    <p>Martin said absolutely nothing at all.</p>
    <p>"You keep me waiting," the voice bellowed. "Me, St. Cyr! Now jump! The rushes are ... Martin, do you hear me?"</p>
    <p>Martin gently laid down the receiver on the desk. He turned again toward the mirror, regarded himself critically, frowned.</p>
    <p>"Dreary," he murmured. "Distinctly dreary. I wonder why I ever bought this necktie?"</p>
    <p>The softly bellowing telephone distracted him. He studied the instrument briefly, then clapped his hands sharply together an inch from the mouthpiece. There was a sharp, anguished cry from the other end of the line.</p>
    <p>"Very good," Martin murmured, turning away. "That robot has done me a considerable favor. I should have realized the possibilities sooner. After all, a super-machine, such as ENIAC, would be far cleverer than a man, who is merely an ordinary machine. Yes," he added, stepping into the hall and coming face to face with Toni LaMotta, who was currently working for Summit on loan. "'Man is a machine, and woman--'" Here he gave Miss LaMotta a look of such arrogant significance that she was quite startled.</p>
    <p>"'And woman--a toy,'" Martin amplified, as he turned toward Theater One, where St. Cyr and destiny awaited him.</p>
    <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
    <p>Summit Studios, outdoing even MGM, always shot ten times as much footage as necessary on every scene. At the beginning of each shooting day, this confusing mass of celluloid was shown in St. Cyr's private projection theater, a small but luxurious domed room furnished with lie-back chairs and every other convenience, though no screen was visible until you looked up. Then you saw it on the ceiling.</p>
    <p>When Martin entered, it was instantly evident that ecology took a sudden shift toward the worse. Operating on the theory that the old Nicholas Martin had come into it, the theater, which had breathed an expensive air of luxurious confidence, chilled toward him. The nap of the Persian rug shrank from his contaminating feet. The chair he stumbled against in the half-light seemed to shrug contemptuously. And the three people in the theater gave him such a look as might be turned upon one of the larger apes who had, by sheer accident, got an invitation to Buckingham Palace.</p>
    <p>DeeDee Fleming (her real name was impossible to remember, besides having not a vowel in it) lay placidly in her chair, her feet comfortably up, her lovely hands folded, her large, liquid gaze fixed upon the screen where DeeDee Fleming, in the silvery meshes of a technicolor mermaid, swam phlegmatically through seas of pearl-colored mist.</p>
    <p>Martin groped in the gloom for a chair. The strangest things were going on inside his brain, where tiny stiles still moved and readjusted until he no longer felt in the least like Nicholas Martin. Who did he feel like, then? What had happened?</p>
    <p>He recalled the neurons whose beady little eyes he had fancied he saw staring brightly into, as well as out of, his own. Or had he? The memory was vivid, yet it couldn't be, of course. The answer was perfectly simple and terribly logical. ENIAC Gamma the Ninety-Third had told him, somewhat ambiguously, just what his ecological experiment involved. Martin had merely been given the optimum reactive pattern of his successful prototype, a man who had most thoroughly controlled his own environment. And ENIAC had told him the man's name, along with several confusing references to other prototypes like an Ivan (who?) and an unnamed Uighur.</p>
    <p>The name for Martin's prototype was, of course, Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield. Martin had a vivid recollection of George Arliss playing the role. Clever, insolent, eccentric in dress and manner, exuberant, suave, self-controlled, with a strongly perceptive imagination....</p>
    <p>"No, no, no!" DeeDee said with a sort of calm impatience. "Be careful, Nick. Some other chair, please. I have my feet on this one."</p>
    <p>"T-t-t-t-t," said Raoul St. Cyr, protruding his thick lips and snapping the fingers of an enormous hand as he pointed to a lowly chair against the wall. "Behind me, Martin. Sit down, sit down. Out of our way. Now! Pay attention. Study what I have done to make something great out of your foolish little play. Especially note how I have so cleverly ended the solo by building to five cumulative pratt-falls. Timing is all," he finished. "Now--SILENCE!"</p>
    <p>For a man born in the obscure little Balkan country of Mixo-Lydia, Raoul St. Cyr had done very well for himself in Hollywood. In 1939 St. Cyr, growing alarmed at the imminence of war, departed for America, taking with him the print of an unpronounceable Mixo-Lydian film he had made, which might be translated roughly as The Pores In the Face of the Peasant.</p>
    <p>With this he established his artistic reputation as a great director, though if the truth were known, it was really poverty that caused The Pores to be so artistically lighted, and simple drunkenness which had made most of the cast act out one of the strangest performances in film history. But critics compared The Pores to a ballet and praised inordinately the beauty of its leading lady, now known to the world as DeeDee Fleming.</p>
    <p>DeeDee was so incredibly beautiful that the law of compensation would force one to expect incredible stupidity as well. One was not disappointed. DeeDee's neurons didn't know anything. She had heard of emotions, and under St. Cyr's bullying could imitate a few of them, but other directors had gone mad trying to get through the semantic block that kept DeeDee's mind a calm, unruffled pool possibly three inches deep. St. Cyr merely bellowed. This simple, primordial approach seemed to be the only one that made sense to Summit's greatest investment and top star.</p>
    <p>With this whip-hand over the beautiful and brainless DeeDee, St. Cyr quickly rose to the top in Hollywood. He had undoubted talent. He could make one picture very well indeed. He had made it twenty times already, each time starring DeeDee, and each time perfecting his own feudalistic production unit. Whenever anyone disagreed with St. Cyr, he had only to threaten to go over to MGM and take the obedient DeeDee with him, for he had never allowed her to sign a long-term contract and she worked only on a picture-to-picture basis. Even Tolliver Watt knuckled under when St. Cyr voiced the threat of removing DeeDee.</p>
    <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
    <p>"Sit down, Martin," Tolliver Watt said. He was a tall, lean, hatchet-faced man who looked like a horse being starved because he was too proud to eat hay. With calm, detached omnipotence he inclined his grey-shot head a millimeter, while a faintly pained expression passed fleetingly across his face.</p>
    <p>"Highball, please," he said.</p>
    <p>A white-clad waiter appeared noiselessly from nowhere and glided forward with a tray. It was at this point that Martin felt the last stiles readjust in his brain, and entirely on impulse he reached out and took the frosted highball glass from the tray. Without observing this the waiter glided on and presented Watt with a gleaming salver full of nothing. Watt and the waiter regarded the tray.</p>
    <p>Then their eyes met. There was a brief silence.</p>
    <p>"Here," Martin said, replacing the glass. "Much too weak. Get me another, please. I'm reorienting toward a new phase, which means a different optimum," he explained to the puzzled Watt as he readjusted a chair beside the great man and dropped into it. Odd that he had never before felt at ease during rushes. Right now he felt fine. Perfectly at ease. Relaxed.</p>
    <p>"Scotch and soda for Mr. Martin," Watt said calmly. "And another for me."</p>
    <p>"So, so, so, now we begin," St. Cyr cried impatiently. He spoke into a hand microphone. Instantly the screen on the ceiling flickered noisily and began to unfold a series of rather ragged scenes in which a chorus of mermaids danced on their tails down the street of a little Florida fishing village.</p>
    <p>To understand the full loathsomeness of the fate facing Nicholas Martin, it is necessary to view a St. Cyr production. It seemed to Martin that he was watching the most noisome movie ever put upon film. He was conscious that St. Cyr and Watt were stealing rather mystified glances at him. In the dark he put up two fingers and sketched a robot-like grin. Then, feeling sublimely sure of himself, he lit a cigarette and chuckled aloud.</p>
    <p>"You laugh?" St. Cyr demanded with instant displeasure. "You do not appreciate great art? What do you know about it, eh? Are you a genius?"</p>
    <p>"This," Martin said urbanely, "is the most noisome movie ever put on film."</p>
    <p>In the sudden, deathly quiet which followed, Martin flicked ashes elegantly and added, "With my help, you may yet avoid becoming the laughing stock of the whole continent. Every foot of this picture must be junked. Tomorrow bright and early we will start all over, and--"</p>
    <p>Watt said quietly, "We're quite competent to make a film out of Angelina Noel, Martin."</p>
    <p>"It is artistic!" St. Cyr shouted. "And it will make money, too!"</p>
    <p>"Bah, money!" Martin said cunningly. He flicked more ash with a lavish gesture. "Who cares about money? Let Summit worry."</p>
    <p>Watt leaned forward to peer searchingly at Martin in the dimness.</p>
    <p>"Raoul," he said, glancing at St. Cyr, "I understood you were getting your--ah--your new writers whipped into shape. This doesn't sound to me as if--"</p>
    <p>"Yes, yes, yes, yes," St. Cyr cried excitedly. "Whipped into shape, exactly! A brief delirium, eh? Martin, you feel well? You feel yourself?"</p>
    <p>Martin laughed with quiet confidence. "Never fear," he said. "The money you spend on me is well worth what I'll bring you in prestige. I quite understand. Our confidential talks were not to be secret from Watt, of course."</p>
    <p>"What confidential talks?" bellowed St. Cyr thickly, growing red.</p>
    <p>"We need keep nothing from Watt, need we?" Martin went on imperturably. "You hired me for prestige, and prestige you'll get, if you can only keep your big mouth shut long enough. I'll make the name of St. Cyr glorious for you. Naturally you may lose something at the box-office, but it's well worth--"</p>
    <p>"Pjrzqxgl!" roared St. Cyr in his native tongue, and he lumbered up from the chair, brandishing the microphone in an enormous, hairy hand.</p>
    <p>Deftly Martin reached out and twitched it from his grasp.</p>
    <p>"Stop the film," he ordered crisply.</p>
    <p>It was very strange. A distant part of his mind knew that normally he would never have dared behave this way, but he felt convinced that never before in his life had he acted with complete normality. He glowed with a giddy warmth of confidence that everything he did would be right, at least while the twelve-hour treatment lasted....</p>
    <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
    <p>The screen flickered hesitantly, then went blank.</p>
    <p>"Turn the lights on," Martin ordered the unseen presence beyond the mike. Softly and suddenly the room glowed with illumination. And upon the visages of Watt and St. Cyr he saw a mutual dawning uneasiness begin to break.</p>
    <p>He had just given them food for thought. But he had given them more than that. He tried to imagine what moved in the minds of the two men, below the suspicions he had just implanted. St. Cyr's was fairly obvious. The Mixo-Lydian licked his lips--no mean task--and studied Martin with uneasy little bloodshot eyes. Clearly Martin had acquired confidence from somewhere. What did it mean? What secret sin of St. Cyr's had been discovered to him, what flaw in his contract, that he dared behave so defiantly?</p>
    <p>Tolliver Watt was a horse of another color; apparently the man had no guilty secrets; but he too looked uneasy. Martin studied the proud face and probed for inner weaknesses. Watt would be a harder nut to crack. But Martin could do it.</p>
    <p>"That last underwater sequence," he now said, pursuing his theme. "Pure trash, you know. It'll have to come out. The whole scene must be shot from under water."</p>
    <p>"Shut up!" St. Cyr shouted violently.</p>
    <p>"But it must, you know," Martin went on. "Or it won't jibe with the new stuff I've written in. In fact, I'm not at all certain that the whole picture shouldn't be shot under water. You know, we could use the documentary technique--"</p>
    <p>"Raoul," Watt said suddenly, "what's this man trying to do?"</p>
    <p>"He is trying to break his contract, of course," St. Cyr said, turning ruddy olive. "It is the bad phase all my writers go through before I get them whipped into shape. In Mixo-Lydia--"</p>
    <p>"Are you sure he'll whip into shape?" Watt asked.</p>
    <p>"To me this is now a personal matter," St. Cyr said, glaring at Martin. "I have spent nearly thirteen weeks on this man and I do not intend to waste my valuable time on another. I tell you he is simply trying to break his contract--tricks, tricks, tricks."</p>
    <p>"Are you?" Watt asked Martin coldly.</p>
    <p>"Not now," Martin said. "I've changed my mind. My agent insists I'd be better off away from Summit. In fact, she has the curious feeling that I and Summit would suffer by a mesalliance. But for the first time I'm not sure I agree. I begin to see possibilities, even in the tripe St. Cyr has been stuffing down the public's throat for years. Of course I can't work miracles all at once. Audiences have come to expect garbage from Summit, and they've even been conditioned to like it. But we'll begin in a small way to re-educate them with this picture. I suggest we try to symbolize the Existentialist hopelessness of it all by ending the film with a full four hundred feet of seascapes--nothing but vast, heaving stretches of ocean," he ended, on a note of complacent satisfaction.</p>
    <p>A vast, heaving stretch of Raoul St. Cyr rose from his chair and advanced upon Martin.</p>
    <p>"Outside, outside!" he shouted. "Back to your cell, you double-crossing vermin! I, Raoul St. Cyr, command it. Outside, before I rip you limb from limb--"</p>
    <p>Martin spoke quickly. His voice was calm, but he knew he would have to work fast.</p>
    <p>"You see, Watt?" he said clearly, meeting Watt's rather startled gaze. "Doesn't dare let you exchange three words with me, for fear I'll let something slip. No wonder he's trying to put me out of here--he's skating on thin ice these days."</p>
    <p>Goaded, St. Cyr rolled forward in a ponderous lunge, but Watt interposed. It was true, of course, that the writer was probably trying to break his contract. But there were wheels within wheels here. Martin was too confident, too debonaire. Something was going on which Watt did not understand.</p>
    <p>"All right, Raoul," he said decisively. "Relax for a minute. I said relax! We don't want Nick here suing you for assault and battery, do we? Your artistic temperament carries you away sometimes. Relax and let's hear what Nick has to say."</p>
    <p>"Watch out for him, Tolliver!" St. Cyr cried warningly. "They're cunning, these creatures. Cunning as rats. You never know--"</p>
    <p>Martin raised the microphone with a lordly gesture. Ignoring the director, he said commandingly into the mike, "Put me through to the commissary. The bar, please. Yes. I want to order a drink. Something very special. A--ah--a Helena Glinska--"</p>
    <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
    <p>"Hello," Erika Ashby's voice said from the door. "Nick, are you there? May I come in?"</p>
    <p>The sound of her voice sent delicious chills rushing up and down Martin's spine. He swung round, mike in hand, to welcome her. But St. Cyr, pleased at this diversion, roared before he could speak.</p>
    <p>"No, no, no, no! Go! Go at once. Whoever you are--out!"</p>
    <p>Erika, looking very brisk, attractive and firm, marched into the room and cast at Martin a look of resigned patience.</p>
    <p>Very clearly she expected to fight both her own battles and his.</p>
    <p>"I'm on business here," she told St. Cyr coldly. "You can't part author and agent like this. Nick and I want to have a word with Mr. Watt."</p>
    <p>"Ah, my pretty creature, sit down," Martin said in a loud, clear voice, scrambling out of his chair. "Welcome! I'm just ordering myself a drink. Will you have something?"</p>
    <p>Erika looked at him with startled suspicion. "No, and neither will you," she said. "How many have you had already? Nick, if you're drunk at a time like this--"</p>
    <p>"And no shilly-shallying," Martin said blandly into the mike. "I want it at once, do you hear? A Helena Glinska, yes. Perhaps you don't know it? Then listen carefully. Take the largest Napoleon you've got. If you haven't a big one, a small punch bowl will do. Fill it half full with ice-cold ale. Got that? Add three jiggers of creme de menthe--"</p>
    <p>"Nick, are you mad?" Erika demanded, revolted.</p>
    <p>"--and six jiggers of honey," Martin went on placidly. "Stir, don't shake. Never shake a Helena Glinska. Keep it well chilled, and--"</p>
    <p>"Miss Ashby, we are very busy," St. Cyr broke in importantly, making shooing motions toward the door. "Not now. Sorry. You interrupt. Go at once."</p>
    <p>"--better add six more jiggers of honey," Martin was heard to add contemplatively into the mike. "And then send it over immediately. Drop everything else, and get it here within sixty seconds. There's a bonus for you if you do. Okay? Good. See to it."</p>
    <p>He tossed the microphone casually at St. Cyr.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Erika had closed in on Tolliver Watt.</p>
    <p>"I've just come from talking to Gloria Eden," she said, "and she's willing to do a one-picture deal with Summit if I okay it. But I'm not going to okay it unless you release Nick Martin from his contract, and that's flat."</p>
    <p>Watt showed pleased surprise.</p>
    <p>"Well, we might get together on that," he said instantly, for he was a fan of Miss Eden's and for a long time had yearned to star her in a remake of Vanity Fair. "Why didn't you bring her along? We could have--"</p>
    <p>"Nonsense!" St. Cyr shouted. "Do not discuss this matter yet, Tolliver."</p>
    <p>"She's down at Laguna," Erika explained. "Be quiet, St. Cyr! I won't--"</p>
    <p>A knock at the door interrupted her. Martin hurried to open it and as he had expected encountered a waiter with a tray.</p>
    <p>"Quick work," he said urbanely, accepting the huge, coldly sweating Napoleon in a bank of ice. "Beautiful, isn't it?"</p>
    <p>St. Cyr's booming shouts from behind him drowned out whatever remark the waiter may have made as he received a bill from Martin and withdrew, looking nauseated.</p>
    <p>"No, no, no, no," St. Cyr was roaring. "Tolliver, we can get Gloria and keep this writer too, not that he is any good, but I have spent already thirteen weeks training him in the St. Cyr approach. Leave it to me. In Mixo-Lydia we handle--"</p>
    <p>Erika's attractive mouth was opening and shutting, her voice unheard in the uproar. St. Cyr could keep it up indefinitely, as was well known in Hollywood. Martin sighed, lifted the brimming Napoleon and sniffed delicately as he stepped backward toward his chair. When his heel touched it, he tripped with the utmost grace and savoir-faire, and very deftly emptied the Helena Glinsak, ale, honey, creme de menthe, ice and all, over St. Cyr's capacious front.</p>
    <p>St. Cyr's bellow broke the microphone.</p>
    <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
    <p>Martin had composed his invention carefully. The nauseous brew combined the maximum elements of wetness, coldness, stickiness and pungency.</p>
    <p>The drenched St. Cyr, shuddering violently as the icy beverage deluged his legs, snatched out his handkerchief and mopped in vain. The handkerchief merely stuck to his trousers, glued there by twelve jiggers of honey. He reeked of peppermint.</p>
    <p>"I suggest we adjourn to the commissary," Martin said fastidiously. "In some private booth we can go on with this discussion away from the--the rather overpowering smell of peppermint."</p>
    <p>"In Mixo-Lydia," St. Cyr gasped, sloshing in his shoes as he turned toward Martin, "in Mixo-Lydia we throw to the dogs--we boil in oil--we--"</p>
    <p>"And next time," Martin said, "please don't joggle my elbow when I'm holding a Helena Glinska. It's most annoying."</p>
    <p>St. Cyr drew a mighty breath, rose to his full height--and then subsided. St. Cyr at the moment looked like a Keystone Kop after the chase sequence, and knew it. Even if he killed Martin now, the element of classic tragedy would be lacking. He would appear in the untenable position of Hamlet murdering his uncle with custard pies.</p>
    <p>"Do nothing until I return!" he commanded, and with a final glare at Martin plunged moistly out of the theater.</p>
    <p>The door crashed shut behind him. There was silence for a moment except for the soft music from the overhead screen which DeeDee had caused to be turned on again, so that she might watch her own lovely form flicker in dimmed images through pastel waves, while she sang a duet with Dan Dailey about sailors, mermaids and her home in far Atlantis.</p>
    <p>"And now," said Martin, turning with quiet authority to Watt, who was regarding him with a baffled expression, "I want a word with you."</p>
    <p>"I can't discuss your contract till Raoul gets back," Watt said quickly.</p>
    <p>"Nonsense," Martin said in a firm voice. "Why should St. Cyr dictate your decisions? Without you, he couldn't turn out a box-office success if he had to. No, be quiet, Erika. I'm handling this, my pretty creature."</p>
    <p>Watt rose to his feet. "Sorry, I can't discuss it," he said. "St. Cyr pictures make money, and you're an inexperien--"</p>
    <p>"That's why I see the true situation so clearly," Martin said. "The trouble with you is you draw a line between artistic genius and financial genius. To you, it's merely routine when you work with the plastic medium of human minds, shaping them into an Ideal Audience. You are an ecological genius, Tolliver Watt! The true artist controls his environment, and gradually you, with a master's consummate skill, shape that great mass of living, breathing humanity into a perfect audience...."</p>
    <p>"Sorry," Watt said, but not, bruskly. "I really have no time--ah--"</p>
    <p>"Your genius has gone long enough unrecognized," Martin said hastily, letting admiration ring in his golden voice. "You assume that St. Cyr is your equal. You give him your own credit titles. Yet in your own mind you must have known that half the credit for his pictures is yours. Was Phidias non-commercial? Was Michaelangelo? Commercialism is simply a label for functionalism, and all great artists produce functional art. The trivial details of Rubens' masterpieces were filled in by assistants, were they not? But Rubens got the credit, not his hirelings. The proof of the pudding's obvious. Why?" Cunningly gauging his listener, Martin here broke off.</p>
    <p>"Why?" Watt asked.</p>
    <p>"Sit down," Martin urged. "I'll tell you why. St. Cyr's pictures make money, but you're responsible for their molding into the ideal form, impressing your character-matrix upon everything and everyone at Summit Studios...."</p>
    <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
    <p>Slowly Watt sank into his chair. About his ears the hypnotic bursts of Disraelian rhodomontade thundered compellingly. For Martin had the man hooked. With unerring aim he had at the first try discovered Watt's weakness--the uncomfortable feeling in a professionally arty town that money-making is a basically contemptible business. Disraeli had handled tougher problems in his day. He had swayed Parliaments.</p>
    <p>Watt swayed, tottered--and fell. It took about ten minutes, all in all. By the end of that time, dizzy with eloquent praise of his economic ability, Watt had realized that while St. Cyr might be an artistic genius, he had no business interfering in the plans of an economic genius. Nobody told Watt what to do when economics were concerned.</p>
    <p>"You have the broad vision that can balance all possibilities and show the right path with perfect clarity," Martin said glibly. "Very well. You wish Eden. You feel--do you not?--that I am unsuitable material. Only geniuses can change their plans with instantaneous speed.... When will my contract release be ready?"</p>
    <p>"What?" said Watt, in a swimming, glorious daze. "Oh. Of course. Hm-m. Your contract release. Well, now--"</p>
    <p>"St. Cyr would stubbornly cling to past errors until Summit goes broke," Martin pointed out. "Only a genius like Tolliver Watt strikes when the iron is hot, when he sees a chance to exchange failure for success, a Martin for an Eden."</p>
    <p>"Hm-m," Watt said. "Yes. Very well, then." His long face grew shrewd. "Very, well, you get your release--after I've signed Eden."</p>
    <p>"There you put your finger on the heart of the matter," Martin approved, after a very brief moment of somewhat dashed thought. "Miss Eden is still undecided. If you left the transaction to somebody like St. Cyr, say, it would be botched. Erika, you have your car here? How quickly could you drive Tolliver Watt to Laguna? He's the only person with the skill to handle this situation."</p>
    <p>"What situa--oh, yes. Of course, Nick. We could start right away."</p>
    <p>"But--" Watt said.</p>
    <p>The Disraeli-matrix swept on into oratorical periods that made the walls ring. The golden tongue played arpeggios with logic.</p>
    <p>"I see," the dazed Watt murmured, allowing himself to be shepherded toward the door. "Yes, yes, of course. Then--suppose you drop over to my place tonight, Martin. After I get the Eden signature, I'll have your release prepared. Hm-m. Functional genius...." His voice fell to a low, crooning mutter, and he moved quietly out of the door.</p>
    <p>Martin laid a hand on Erika's arm as she followed him.</p>
    <p>"Wait a second," he said. "Keep him away from the studio until we get the release. St. Cyr can still out-shout me any time. But he's hooked. We--"</p>
    <p>"Nick," Erika said, looking searchingly into his face. "What's happened?"</p>
    <p>"Tell you tonight," Martin said hastily, hearing a distant bellow that might be the voice of St. Cyr approaching. "When I have time I'm going to sweep you off your feet. Did you know that I've worshipped you from afar all my life? But right now, get Watt out of the way. Hurry!"</p>
    <p>Erika cast a glance of amazed bewilderment at him as he thrust her out of the door. Martin thought there was a certain element of pleasure in the surprise.</p>
    <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
    <p>"Where is Tolliver?" The loud, annoyed roar of St. Cyr made Martin wince. The director was displeased, it appeared, because only in Costumes could a pair of trousers be found large enough to fit him. He took it as a personal affront. "What have you done with Tolliver?" he bellowed.</p>
    <p>"Louder, please," Martin said insolently. "I can't hear you."</p>
    <p>"DeeDee," St. Cyr shouted, whirling toward the lovely star, who hadn't stirred from her rapturous admiration of DeeDee in technicolor overhead. "Where is Tolliver?"</p>
    <p>Martin started. He had quite forgotten DeeDee.</p>
    <p>"You don't know, do you, DeeDee?" he prompted quickly.</p>
    <p>"Shut up," St. Cyr snapped. "Answer me, you--" He added a brisk polysyllable in Mixo-Lydian, with the desired effect. DeeDee wrinkled her flawless brow.</p>
    <p>"Tolliver went away, I think. I've got it mixed up with the picture. He went home to meet Nick Martin, didn't he?"</p>
    <p>"See?" Martin interrupted, relieved. "No use expecting DeeDee to--"</p>
    <p>"But Martin is here!" St. Cyr shouted. "Think, think!"</p>
    <p>"Was the contract release in the rushes?" DeeDee asked vaguely.</p>
    <p>"A contract release?" St. Cyr roared. "What is this? Never will I permit it, never, never, never! DeeDee, answer me--where has Watt gone?"</p>
    <p>"He went somewhere with that agent," DeeDee said. "Or was that in the rushes too?"</p>
    <p>"But where, where, where?"</p>
    <p>"They went to Atlantis," DeeDee announced with an air of faint triumph.</p>
    <p>"No!" shouted St. Cyr. "That was the picture! The mermaid came from Atlantis, not Watt!"</p>
    <p>"Tolliver didn't say he was coming from Atlantis," DeeDee murmured, unruffled. "He said he was going to Atlantis. Then he was going to meet Nick Martin at his house tonight and give him his contract release."</p>
    <p>"When?" St. Cyr demanded furiously. "Think, DeeDee? What time did--"</p>
    <p>"DeeDee," Martin said, stepping forward with suave confidence, "you can't remember a thing, can you?" But DeeDee was too subnormal to react even to a Disraeli-matrix. She merely smiled placidly at him.</p>
    <p>"Out of my way, you writer!" roared St. Cyr, advancing upon Martin. "You will get no contract release! You do not waste St. Cyr's time and get away with it! This I will not endure. I fix you as I fixed Ed Cassidy!"</p>
    <p>Martin drew himself up and froze St. Cyr with an insolent smile. His hand toyed with an imaginary monocle. Golden periods were hanging at the end of his tongue. There only remained to hypnotize St. Cyr as he had hypnotized Watt. He drew a deep breath to unlease the floods of his eloquence--</p>
    <p>And St. Cyr, also too subhuman to be impressed by urbanity, hit Martin a clout on the jaw.</p>
    <p>It could never have happened in the British Parliament.</p>

    <p>When the robot walked into Martin's office that evening, he, or it, went directly to the desk, unscrewed the bulb from the lamp, pressed the switch, and stuck his finger into the socket. There was a crackling flash. ENIAC withdrew his finger and shook his metallic head violently.</p>
    <p>"I needed that," he sighed. "I've been on the go all day, by the Kaldekooz time-scale. Paleolithic, Neolithic, Technological--I don't even know what time it is. Well, how's your ecological adjustment getting on?"</p>
    <p>Martin rubbed his chin thoughtfully.</p>
    <p>"Badly," he said. "Tell me, did Disraeli, as Prime Minister, ever have any dealings with a country called Mixo-Lydia?"</p>
    <p>"I have no idea," said the robot. "Why do you ask?"</p>
    <p>"Because my environment hauled back and took a poke at my jaw," Martin said shortly.</p>
    <p>"Then you provoked it," ENIAC countered. "A crisis--a situation of stress--always brings a man's dominant trait to the fore, and Disraeli was dominantly courageous. Under stress, his courage became insolence. But he was intelligent enough to arrange his environment so insolence would be countered on the semantic level. Mixo-Lydia, eh? I place it vaguely, some billions of years ago, when it was inhabited by giant white apes. Or--oh, now I remember. It's an encysted medieval survival, isn't it?"</p>
    <p>Martin nodded.</p>
    <p>"So is this movie studio," the robot said. "Your trouble is that you've run up against somebody who's got a better optimum ecological adjustment than you have. That's it. This studio environment is just emerging from medievalism, so it can easily slip back into that plenum when an optimum medievalist exerts pressure. Such types caused the Dark Ages. Well, you'd better change your environment to a neo-technological one, where the Disraeli matrix can be successfully pro-survival. In your era, only a few archaic social-encystments like this studio are feudalistic, so go somewhere else. It takes a feudalist to match a feudalist."</p>
    <p>"But I can't go somewhere else," Martin complained. "Not without my contract release. I was supposed to pick it up tonight, but St. Cyr found out what was happening, and he'll throw a monkey-wrench in the works if he has to knock me out again to do it. I'm due at Watt's place now, but St. Cyr's already there--"</p>
    <p>"Spare me the trivia," the robot said, raising his hand. "As for this St. Cyr, if he's a medieval character-type, obviously he'll knuckle under only to a stronger man of his own kind."</p>
    <p>"How would Disraeli have handled this?" Martin demanded.</p>
    <p>"Disraeli would never have got into such a situation in the first place," the robot said unhelpfully. "The ecologizer can give you the ideal ecological differential, but only for your own type, because otherwise it wouldn't be your optimum. Disraeli would have been a failure in Russia in Ivan's time."</p>
    <p>"Would you mind clarifying that?" Martin asked thoughtfully.</p>
    <p>"Certainly," the robot said with great rapidity. "It all depends on the threshold-response-time of the memory-circuits in the brain, if you assume the identity of the basic chromosome-pattern. The strength of neuronic activation varies in inverse proportion to the quantative memory factor. Only actual experience could give you Disraeli's memories, but your reactivity-thresholds have been altered until perception and emotional-indices approximate the Disraeli ratio."</p>
    <p>"Oh," Martin said. "But how would you, say, assert yourself against a medieval steam-shovel?"</p>
    <p>"By plugging my demountable brain into a larger steam-shovel," ENIAC told him.</p>
    <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
    <p>Martin seemed pensive. His hand rose, adjusting an invisible monocle, while a look of perceptive imagination suddenly crossed his face.</p>
    <p>"You mentioned Russia in Ivan's time," he said. "Which Ivan would that be? Not, by any chance--?"</p>
    <p>"Ivan the Fourth. Very well adjusted to his environment he was, too. However, enough of this chit-chat. Obviously you'll be one of the failures in our experiment, but our aim is to strike an average, so if you'll put the ecologizer on your--"</p>
    <p>"That was Ivan the Terrible, wasn't it?" Martin interrupted. "Look here, could you impress the character-matrix of Ivan the Terrible on my brain?"</p>
    <p>"That wouldn't help you a bit," the robot said. "Besides, it's not the purpose of the experiment. Now--"</p>
    <p>"One moment. Disraeli can't cope with a medievalist like St. Cyr on his own level, but if I had Ivan the Terrible's reactive thresholds, I'll bet I could throw a bluff that might do the trick. Even though St. Cyr's bigger than I am, he's got a veneer of civilization ... now wait. He trades on that. He's always dealt with people who are too civilized to use his own methods. The trick would be to call his bluff. And Ivan's the man who could do it."</p>
    <p>"But you don't understand."</p>
    <p>"Didn't everybody in Russia tremble with fear at Ivan's name?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, in--"</p>
    <p>"Very well, then," Martin said triumphantly. "You're going to impress the character-matrix, of Ivan the Terrible on my mind, and then I'm going to put the bite on St. Cyr, the way Ivan would have done it. Disraeli's simply too civilized. Size is a factor, but character's more important. I don't look like Disraeli, but people have been reacting to me as though I were George Arliss down to the spit-curl. A good big man can always lick a good little man. But St. Cyr's never been up against a really uncivilized little man--one who'd gladly rip out an enemy's heart with his bare hands." Martin nodded briskly. "St. Cyr will back down--I've found that out. But it would take somebody like Ivan to make him stay all the way down."</p>
    <p>"If you think I'm going to impress Ivan's matrix on you, you're wrong," the robot said.</p>
    <p>"You couldn't be talked into it?"</p>
    <p>"I," said ENIAC, "am a robot, semantically adjusted. Of course you couldn't talk me into it."</p>
    <p>Perhaps not, Martin reflected, but Disraeli--hm-m. "Man is a machine." Why, Disraeli was the one person in the world ideally fitted for robot-coercion. To him, men were machines--and what was ENIAC?</p>
    <p>"Let's talk this over--" Martin began, absently pushing the desk-lamp toward the robot. And then the golden tongue that had swayed empires was loosed....</p>
    <p>"You're not going to like this," the robot said dazedly, sometime later. "Ivan won't do at ... oh, you've got me all confused. You'll have to eyeprint a--" He began to pull out of his sack the helmet and the quarter-mile of red ribbon.</p>
    <p>"To tie up my bonny grey brain," Martin said, drunk with his own rhetoric. "Put it on my head. That's right. Ivan the Terrible, remember. I'll fix St. Cyr's Mixo-Lydian wagon."</p>
    <p>"Differential depends on environment as much as on heredity," the robot muttered, clapping the helmet on Martin's head. "Though naturally Ivan wouldn't have had the Tsardom environment without his particular heredity, involving Helena Glinska--there!" He removed the helmet.</p>
    <p>"But nothing's happening," Martin said. "I don't feel any different."</p>
    <p>"It'll take a few moments. This isn't your basic character-pattern, remember, as Disraeli's was. Enjoy yourself while you can. You'll get the Ivan-effect soon enough." He shouldered the sack and headed uncertainly for the door.</p>
    <p>"Wait," Martin said uneasily. "Are you sure--"</p>
    <p>"Be quiet. I forgot something--some formality--now I'm all confused. Well, I'll think of it later, or earlier, as the case may be. I'll see you in twelve hours--I hope."</p>
    <p>The robot departed. Martin shook his head tentatively from side to side. Then he got up and followed ENIAC to the door. But there was no sign of the robot, except for a diminishing whirlwind of dust in the middle of the corridor.</p>
    <p>Something began to happen in Martin's brain....</p>
    <p>Behind him, the telephone rang.</p>
    <p>Martin heard himself gasp with pure terror. With a sudden, impossible, terrifying, absolute certainty he knew who was telephoning.</p>
    <p>Assassins!</p>
    <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
    <p>"Yes, Mr. Martin," said Tolliver Watt's butler to the telephone. "Miss Ashby is here. She is with Mr. Watt and Mr. St. Cyr at the moment, but I will give her your message. You are detained. And she is to call for you--where?"</p>
    <p>"The broom-closet on the second floor of the Writers' Building," Martin said in a quavering voice. "It's the only one near a telephone with a long enough cord so I could take the phone in here with me. But I'm not at all certain that I'm safe. I don't like the looks of that broom on my left."</p>
    <p>"Sir?"</p>
    <p>"Are you sure you're Tolliver Watt's butler?" Martin demanded nervously.</p>
    <p>"Quite sure, Mr.--eh--Mr. Martin."</p>
    <p>"I am Mr. Martin," cried Martin with terrified defiance. "By all the laws of God and man, Mr. Martin I am and Mr. Martin I will remain, in spite of all attempts by rebellious dogs to depose me from my rightful place."</p>
    <p>"Yes, sir. The broom-closet, you say, sir?"</p>
    <p>"The broom-closet. Immediately. But swear not to tell another soul, no matter how much you're threatened. I'll protect you."</p>
    <p>"Very well, sir. Is that all?"</p>
    <p>"Yes. Tell Miss Ashby to hurry. Hang up now. The line may be tapped. I have enemies."</p>
    <p>There was a click. Martin replaced his own receiver and furtively surveyed the broom-closet. He told himself that this was ridiculous. There was nothing to be afraid of, was there? True, the broom-closet's narrow walls were closing in upon him alarmingly, while the ceiling descended....</p>
    <p>Panic-stricken, Martin emerged from the closet, took a long breath, and threw back his shoulders. "N-not a thing to be afraid of," he said. "Who's afraid?" Whistling, he began to stroll down the hall toward the staircase, but midway agoraphobia overcame him, and his nerve broke.</p>
    <p>He ducked into his own office and sweated quietly in the dark until he had mustered up enough courage to turn on a lamp.</p>
    <p>The Encyclopedia Britannica, in its glass-fronted cabinet, caught his eye. With noiseless haste, Martin secured ITALY to LORD and opened the volume at his desk. Something, obviously, was very, very wrong. The robot had said that Martin wasn't going to like being Ivan the Terrible, come to think of it. But was Martin wearing Ivan's character-matrix? Perhaps he'd got somebody else's matrix by mistake--that of some arrant coward. Or maybe the Mad Tsar of Russia had really been called Ivan the Terrified. Martin flipped the rustling pages nervously. Ivan, Ivan--here it was.</p>
    <p>Son of Helena Glinska ... married Anastasia Zakharina-Koshkina ... private life unspeakably abominable ... memory astonishing, energy indefatigable, ungovernable fury--great natural ability, political foresight, anticipated the ideals of Peter the Great--Martin shook his head.</p>
    <p>Then he caught his breath at the next line.</p>
    <p>Ivan had lived in an atmosphere of apprehension, imagining that every man's hand was against him.</p>
    <p>"Just like me," Martin murmured. "But--but there was more to Ivan than just cowardice. I don't understand."</p>
    <p>"Differential," the robot had said, "depends on environment as much as on heredity. Though naturally Ivan wouldn't have had the Tsardom environment without his particular heredity."</p>
    <p>Martin sucked in his breath sharply. Environment does make a difference. No doubt Ivan IV had been a fearful coward, but heredity plus environment had given Ivan the one great weapon that had enabled him to keep his cowardice a recessive trait.</p>
    <p>Ivan the Terrible had been Tsar of all the Russias.</p>
    <p>Give a coward a gun, and, while he doesn't stop being a coward, it won't show in the same way. He may act like a violent, aggressive tyrant instead. That, of course, was why Ivan had been ecologically successful--in his specialized environment. He'd never run up against many stresses that brought his dominant trait to the fore. Like Disraeli, he had been able to control his environment so that such stresses were practically eliminated.</p>
    <p>Martin turned green.</p>
    <p>Then he remembered Erika. Could he get Erika to keep St. Cyr busy, somehow, while he got his contract release from Watt? As long as he could avoid crises, he could keep his nerve from crumbling, but--there were assassins everywhere!</p>
    <p>Erika was on her way to the lot by now. Martin swallowed.</p>
    <p>He would meet her outside the studio. The broom-closet wasn't safe. He could be trapped there like a rat--</p>
    <p>"Nonsense," Martin told himself with shivering firmness. "This isn't me. All I have to do is get a g-grip on m-myself. Come, now. Buck up. Toujours l'audace!"</p>
    <p>But he went out of his office and downstairs very softly and cautiously. After all, one never knew. And when every man's hand was against one....</p>
    <p>Quaking, the character-matrix of Ivan the Terrible stole toward a studio gate.</p>
    <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
    <p>The taxi drove rapidly toward Bel-Air.</p>
    <p>"But what were you doing up that tree?" Erika demanded.</p>
    <p>Martin shook violently.</p>
    <p>"A werewolf," he chattered. "And a vampire and a ghoul and--I saw them, I tell you. There I was at the studio gate, and they all came at me in a mob."</p>
    <p>"But they were just coming back from dinner," Erika said. "You know Summit's doing night shooting on Abbott and Costello Meet Everybody. Karloff wouldn't hurt a fly."</p>
    <p>"I kept telling myself that," Martin said dully, "but I was out of my mind with guilt and fear. You see, I'm an abominable monster. But it's not my fault. It's environmental. I grew up in brutal and degrading conditions--oh, look!" He pointed toward a traffic cop ahead. "The police! Traitors even in the palace guards!"</p>
    <p>"Lady, is that guy nuts?" the cabbie demanded.</p>
    <p>"Mad or sane, I am Nicholas Martin," Martin announced, with an abrupt volte face. He tried to stand up commandingly, bumped his head, screamed "Assassins!" and burrowed into a corner of the seat, panting horribly.</p>
    <p>Erika gave him a thoughtful, worried look.</p>
    <p>"Nick," she said, "How much have you had to drink? What's wrong?"</p>
    <p>Martin shut his eyes and lay back against the cushions.</p>
    <p>"Let me have a few minutes, Erika," he pleaded. "I'll be all right as soon as I recover from stress. It's only when I'm under stress that Ivan--"</p>
    <p>"You can accept your contract release from Watt, can't you? Surely you'll be able to manage that."</p>
    <p>"Of course," Martin said with feeble bravery. He thought it over and reconsidered. "If I can hold your hand," he suggested, taking no chances.</p>
    <p>This disgusted Erika so much that for two miles there was no more conversation within the cab.</p>
    <p>Erika had been thinking her own thoughts.</p>
    <p>"You've certainly changed since this morning," she observed. "Threatening to make love to me, of all things. As if I'd stand for it. I'd like to see you try." There was a pause. Erika slid her eyes sidewise toward Martin. "I said I'd like to see you try," she repeated.</p>
    <p>"Oh, you would, would you?" Martin said with hollow valor. He paused. Oddly enough his tongue, hitherto frozen stiff on one particular subject in Erika's presence, was now thoroughly loosened. Martin wasted no time on theory. Seizing his chance before a new stress might unexpectedly arise, he instantly poured out his heart to Erika, who visibly softened.</p>
    <p>"But why didn't you ever say so before?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"I can't imagine," Martin said. "Then you'll marry me?"</p>
    <p>"But why were you acting so--"</p>
    <p>"Will you marry me?"</p>
    <p>"Yes," Erika said, and there was a pause. Martin moistened his lips, discovering that somehow he and Erika had moved close together. He was about to seal the bargain in the customary manner when a sudden thought struck him and made him draw back with a little start.</p>
    <p>Erika opened her eyes.</p>
    <p>"Ah--" said Martin. "Um. I just happened to remember. There's a bad flu epidemic in Chicago. Epidemics spread like wildfire, you know. Why, it could be in Hollywood by now--especially with the prevailing westerly winds."</p>
    <p>"I'm damned if I'm going to be proposed to and not kissed," Erika said in a somewhat irritated tone. "You kiss me!"</p>
    <p>"But I might give you bubonic plague," Martin said nervously. "Kissing spreads germs. It's a well-known fact."</p>
    <p>"Nick!"</p>
    <p>"Well--I don't know--when did you last have a cold?"</p>
    <p>Erika pulled away from him and went to sit in the other corner.</p>
    <p>"Ah," Martin said, after a long silence. "Erika?"</p>
    <p>"Don't talk to me, you miserable man," Erika said. "You monster, you."</p>
    <p>"I can't help it," Martin cried wildly. "I'll be a coward for twelve hours. It's not my fault. After eight tomorrow morning I'll--I'll walk into a lion-cage if you want, but tonight I'm as yellow as Ivan the Terrible! At least let me tell you what's been happening."</p>
    <p>Erika said nothing. Martin instantly plunged into his long and improbable tale.</p>
    <p>"I don't believe a word of it," Erika said, when he had finished. She shook her head sharply. "Just the same, I'm still your agent, and your career's still my responsibility. The first and only thing we have to do is get your contract release from Tolliver Watt. And that's all we're going to consider right now, do you hear?"</p>
    <p>"But St. Cyr--"</p>
    <p>"I'll do all the talking. You won't have to say a word. If St. Cyr tries to bully you, I'll handle him. But you've got to be there with me, or St. Cyr will make that an excuse to postpone things again. I know him."</p>
    <p>"Now I'm under stress again," Martin said wildly. "I can't stand it. I'm not the Tsar of Russia."</p>
    <p>"Lady," said the cab-driver, looking back, "if I was you, I'd sure as hell break off that engagement."</p>
    <p>"Heads will roll for this," Martin said ominously.</p>
    <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
    <p>"By mutual consent, agree to terminate ... yes," Watt said, affixing his name to the legal paper that lay before him on the desk. "That does it. But where in the world is that fellow Martin? He came in with you, I'm certain."</p>
    <p>"Did he?" Erika asked, rather wildly. She too, was wondering how Martin had managed to vanish so miraculously from her side. Perhaps he had crept with lightning rapidity under the carpet. She forced her mind from the thought and reached for the contract release Watt was folding.</p>
    <p>"Wait," St. Cyr said, his lower lip jutting. "What about a clause giving us an option on Martin's next play?"</p>
    <p>Watt paused, and the director instantly struck home.</p>
    <p>"Whatever it may be, I can turn it into a vehicle for DeeDee, eh, DeeDee?" He lifted a sausage finger at the lovely star, who nodded obediently.</p>
    <p>"It's going to have an all-male cast," Erika said hastily. "And we're discussing contract releases, not options."</p>
    <p>"He would give me an option if I had him here," St. Cyr growled, torturing his cigar horribly. "Why does everything conspire against an artist?" He waved a vast, hairy fist in the air. "Now I must break in a new writer, which is a great waste. Within a fortnight Martin would have been a St. Cyr writer. In fact, it is still possible."</p>
    <p>"I'm afraid not, Raoul," Watt said resignedly. "You really shouldn't have hit Martin at the studio today."</p>
    <p>"But--but he would not dare charge me with assault. In Mixo-Lydia--"</p>
    <p>"Why, hello, Nick," DeeDee said, with a bright smile. "What are you hiding behind those curtains for?"</p>
    <p>Every eye was turned toward the window draperies, just in time to see the white, terrified face of Nicholas Martin flip out of sight like a scared chipmunk's. Erika, her heart dropping, said hastily, "Oh, that isn't Nick. It doesn't look a bit like him. You made a mistake, DeeDee."</p>
    <p>"Did I?" DeeDee asked, perfectly willing to agree.</p>
    <p>"Certainly," Erika said, reaching for the contract release in Watt's hand. "Now if you'll just let me have this, I'll--"</p>
    <p>"Stop!" cried St. Cyr in a bull's bellow. Head sunk between his heavy shoulders, he lumbered to the window and jerked the curtains aside.</p>
    <p>"Ha!" the director said in a sinister voice. "Martin."</p>
    <p>"It's a lie," Martin said feebly, making a desperate attempt to conceal his stress-triggered panic. "I've abdicated."</p>
    <p>St. Cyr, who had stepped back a pace, was studying Martin carefully. Slowly the cigar in his mouth began to tilt upwards. An unpleasant grin widened the director's mouth.</p>
    <p>He shook a finger under Martin's quivering nostrils.</p>
    <p>"You!" he said. "Tonight it is a different tune, eh? Today you were drunk. Now I see it all. Valorous with pots, like they say."</p>
    <p>"Nonsense," Martin said, rallying his courage by a glance at Erika. "Who say? Nobody but you would say a thing like that. Now what's this all about?"</p>
    <p>"What were you doing behind that curtain?" Watt asked.</p>
    <p>"I wasn't behind the curtain," Martin said, with great bravado. "You were. All of you. I was in front of the curtain. Can I help it if the whole lot of you conceal yourselves behind curtains in a library, like--like conspirators?" The word was unfortunately chosen. A panicky light flashed into Martin's eyes. "Yes, conspirators," he went on nervously. "You think I don't know, eh? Well, I do. You're all assassins, plotting and planning. So this is your headquarters, is it? All night your hired dogs have been at my heels, driving me like a wounded caribou to--"</p>
    <p>"We've got to be going," Erika said desperately. "There's just time to catch the next carib--the next plane east." She reached for the contract release, but Watt suddenly put it in his pocket. He turned his chair toward Martin.</p>
    <p>"Will you give us an option on your next play?" he demanded.</p>
    <p>"Of course he will give us an option!" St. Cyr said, studying Martin's air of bravado with an experienced eye. "Also, there is to be no question of a charge of assault, for, if there is I will beat you. So it is in Mixo-Lydia. In fact, you do not even want a release from your contract, Martin. It is all a mistake. I will turn you into a St. Cyr writer, and all will be well. So. Now you will ask Tolliver to tear up that release, will you not--ha?"</p>
    <p>"Of course you won't, Nick," Erika cried. "Say so!"</p>
    <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
    <p>There was a pregnant silence. Watt watched with sharp interest. So did the unhappy Erika, torn between her responsibility as Martin's agent and her disgust at the man's abject cowardice. DeeDee watched too, her eyes very wide and a cheerful smile upon her handsome face. But the battle was obviously between Martin and Raoul St. Cyr.</p>
    <p>Martin drew himself up desperately. Now or never he must force himself to be truly Terrible. Already he had a troubled expression, just like Ivan. He strove to look sinister too. An enigmatic smile played around his lips. For an instant he resembled the Mad Tsar of Russia, except, of course, that he was clean-shaven. With contemptuous, regal power Martin stared down the Mixo-Lydian.</p>
    <p>"You will tear up that release and sign an agreement giving us option on your next play too, ha?" St. Cyr said--but a trifle uncertainly.</p>
    <p>"I'll do as I please," Martin told him. "How would you like to be eaten alive by dogs?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know, Raoul," Watt said. "Let's try to get this settled even if--"</p>
    <p>"Do you want me to go over to Metro and take DeeDee with me?" St. Cyr cried, turning toward Watt. "He will sign!" And, reaching into an inner pocket for a pen, the burly director swung back toward Martin.</p>
    <p>"Assassin!" cried Martin, misinterpreting the gesture.</p>
    <p>A gloating smile appeared on St. Cyr's revolting features.</p>
    <p>"Now we have him, Tolliver," he said, with heavy triumph, and these ominous words added the final stress to Martin's overwhelming burden. With a mad cry he rushed past St. Cyr, wrenched open a door, and fled.</p>
    <p>From behind him came Erika's Valkyrie voice.</p>
    <p>"Leave him alone! Haven't you done enough already? Now I'm going to get that contract release from you before I leave this room, Tolliver Watt, and I warn you, St. Cyr, if you--"</p>
    <p>But by then Martin was five rooms away, and the voice faded. He darted on, hopelessly trying to make himself slow down and return to the scene of battle. The pressure was too strong. Terror hurled him down a corridor, into another room, and against a metallic object from which he rebounded, to find himself sitting on the floor looking up at ENIAC Gamma the Ninety-Third.</p>
    <p>"Ah, there you are," the robot said. "I've been searching all over space-time for you. You forgot to give me a waiver of responsibility when you talked me into varying the experiment. The Authorities would be in my gears if I didn't bring back an eyeprinted waiver when a subject's scratched by variance."</p>
    <p>With a frightened glance behind him, Martin rose to his feet.</p>
    <p>"What?" he asked confusedly. "Listen, you've got to change me back to myself. Everyone's trying to kill me. You're just in time. I can't wait twelve hours. Change me back to myself, quick!"</p>
    <p>"Oh, I'm through with you," the robot said callously. "You're no longer a suitably unconditioned subject, after that last treatment you insisted on. I should have got the waiver from you then, but you got me all confused with Disraeli's oratory. Now here. Just hold this up to your left eye for twenty seconds." He extended a flat, glittering little metal disk. "It's already sensitized and filled out. It only needs your eyeprint. Affix it, and you'll never see me again."</p>
    <p>Martin shrank away.</p>
    <p>"But what's going to happen to me?" he quavered, swallowing.</p>
    <p>"How should I know? After twelve hours, the treatment will wear off, and you'll be yourself again. Hold this up to your eye, now."</p>
    <p>"I will if you'll change me back to myself," Martin haggled.</p>
    <p>"I can't. It's against the rules. One variance is bad enough, even with a filed waiver, but two? Oh, no. Hold this up to your left eye--"</p>
    <p>"No," Martin said with feeble firmness. "I won't."</p>
    <p>ENIAC studied him.</p>
    <p>"Yes, you will," the robot said finally, "or I'll go boo at you."</p>
    <p>Martin paled slightly, but he shook his head in desperate determination.</p>
    <p>"No," he said doggedly. "Unless I get rid of Ivan's matrix right now, Erika will never marry me and I'll never get my contract release from Watt. All you have to do is put that helmet on my head and change me back to myself. Is that too much to ask?"</p>
    <p>"Certainly, of a robot," ENIAC said stiffly. "No more shilly-shallying. It's lucky you are wearing the Ivan-matrix, so I can impose my will on you. Put your eyeprint on this. Instantly!"</p>
    <p>Martin rushed behind the couch and hid. The robot advanced menacingly. And at that moment, pushed to the last ditch, Martin suddenly remembered something.</p>
    <p>He faced the robot.</p>
    <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
    <p>"Wait," he said. "You don't understand. I can't eyeprint that thing. It won't work on me. Don't you realize that? It's supposed to take the eyeprint--"</p>
    <p>"--of the rod-and-cone pattern of the retina," the robot said. "So--"</p>
    <p>"So how can it do that unless I can keep my eye open for twenty seconds? My perceptive reaction-thresholds are Ivan's aren't they? I can't control the reflex of blinking. I've got a coward's synapses. And they'd force me to shut my eyes tight the second that gimmick got too close to them."</p>
    <p>"Hold them open," the robot suggested. "With your fingers."</p>
    <p>"My fingers have reflexes too," Martin argued, moving toward a sideboard. "There's only one answer. I've got to get drunk. If I'm half stupefied with liquor, my reflexes will be so slow I won't be able to shut my eyes. And don't try to use force, either. If I dropped dead with fear, how could you get my eyeprint then?"</p>
    <p>"Very easily," the robot said. "I'd pry open your lids--"</p>
    <p>Martin hastily reached for a bottle on the sideboard, and a glass. But his hand swerved aside and gripped, instead, a siphon of soda water.</p>
    <p>"--only," ENIAC went on, "the forgery might be detected."</p>
    <p>Martin fizzled the glass full of soda and took a long drink.</p>
    <p>"I won't be long getting drunk," he said, his voice thickening. "In fact, it's beginning to work already. See? I'm coöperating."</p>
    <p>The robot hesitated.</p>
    <p>"Well, hurry up about it," he said, and sat down.</p>
    <p>Martin, about to take another drink, suddenly paused, staring at ENIAC. Then, with a sharply indrawn breath, he lowered the glass.</p>
    <p>"What's the matter now?" the robot asked. "Drink your--what is it?"</p>
    <p>"It's whiskey," Martin told the inexperienced automaton, "but now I see it all. You've put poison in it. So that's your plan, is it? Well, I won't touch another drop, and now you'll never get my eyeprint. I'm no fool."</p>
    <p>"Cog Almighty," the robot said, rising. "You poured that drink yourself. How could I have poisoned it? Drink!"</p>
    <p>"I won't," Martin said, with a coward's stubbornness, fighting back the growing suspicion that the drink might really be toxic.</p>
    <p>"You swallow that drink," ENIAC commanded, his voice beginning to quiver slightly. "It's perfectly harmless."</p>
    <p>"Then prove it!" Martin said cunningly. "Would you be willing to switch glasses? Would you drink this poisoned brew yourself?"</p>
    <p>"How do you expect me to drink?" the robot demanded. "I--" He paused. "All right, hand me the glass," he said. "I'll take a sip. Then you've got to drink the rest of it."</p>
    <p>"Aha!" Martin said. "You betrayed yourself that time. You're a robot. You can't drink, remember? Not the same way that I can, anyhow. Now I've got you trapped, you assassin. There's your brew." He pointed to a floor-lamp. "Do you dare to drink with me now, in your electrical fashion, or do you admit you are trying to poison me? Wait a minute, what am I saying? That wouldn't prove a--"</p>
    <p>"Of course it would," the robot said hastily. "You're perfectly right, and it's very cunning of you. We'll drink together, and that will prove your whiskey's harmless--so you'll keep on drinking till your reflexes slow down, see?"</p>
    <p>"Well," Martin began uncertainly, but the unscrupulous robot unscrewed a bulb from the floor lamp, pulled the switch, and inserted his finger into the empty socket, which caused a crackling flash. "There," the robot said. "It isn't poisoned, see?"</p>
    <p>"You're not swallowing it," Martin said suspiciously. "You're holding it in your mouth--I mean your finger."</p>
    <p>ENIAC again probed the socket.</p>
    <p>"Well, all right, perhaps," Martin said, in a doubtful fashion. "But I'm not going to risk your slipping a powder in my liquor, you traitor. You're going to keep up with me, drink for drink, until I can eyeprint that gimmick of yours--or else I stop drinking. But does sticking your finger in that lamp really prove my liquor isn't poisoned? I can't quite--"</p>
    <p>"Of course it does," the robot said quickly. "I'll prove it. I'll do it again ... f(t). Powerful DC, isn't it? Certainly it proves it. Keep drinking, now."</p>
    <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
    <p>His gaze watchfully on the robot, Martin lifted his glass of club soda.</p>
    <p>"F ff ff f(t)!" cried the robot, some time later, sketching a singularly loose smile on its metallic face.</p>
    <p>"Best fermented mammoth's milk I ever tasted," Martin agreed, lifting his tenth glass of soda-water. He felt slightly queasy and wondered if he might be drowning.</p>
    <p>"Mammoth's milk?" asked ENIAC thickly. "What year is this?"</p>
    <p>Martin drew a long breath. Ivan's capacious memory had served him very well so far. Voltage, he recalled, increased the frequency of the robot's thought-patterns and disorganized ENIAC's memory--which was being proved before his eyes. But the crux of his plan was yet to come....</p>
    <p>"The year of the great Hairy One, of course," Martin said briskly. "Don't you remember?"</p>
    <p>"Then you--" ENIAC strove to focus upon his drinking-companion. "You must be Mammoth-Slayer."</p>
    <p>"That's it!" Martin cried. "Have another jolt. What about giving me the treatment now?"</p>
    <p>"What treatment?"</p>
    <p>Martin looked impatient. "You said you were going to impose the character-matrix of Mammoth-Slayer on my mind. You said that would insure my optimum ecological adjustment in this temporal phase, and nothing else would."</p>
    <p>"Did I? But you're not Mammoth-Slayer," ENIAC said confusedly. "Mammoth-Slayer was the son of the Great Hairy One. What's your mother's name?"</p>
    <p>"The Great Hairy One," Martin replied, at which the robot grated its hand across its gleaming forehead.</p>
    <p>"Have one more jolt," Martin suggested. "Now take out the ecologizer and put it on my head."</p>
    <p>"Like this?" ENIAC asked, obeying. "I keep feeling I've forgotten something important. F (t)."</p>
    <p>Martin adjusted the crystal helmet on his skull. "Now," he commanded. "Give me the character-matrix of Mammoth-Slayer, son of the Great Hairy One."</p>
    <p>"Well--all right," ENIAC said dizzily. The red ribbons swirled. There was a flash from the helmet. "There," the robot said. "It's done. It may take a few minutes to begin functioning, but then for twelve hours you'll--wait! Where are you going?"</p>
    <p>But Martin had already departed.</p>
    <p>The robot stuffed the helmet and the quarter-mile of red ribbon back for the last time. He lurched to the floor-lamp, muttering something about one for the road. Afterward, the room lay empty. A fading murmur said, "F(t)."</p>
    <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
    <p>"Nick!" Erika gasped, staring at the figure in the doorway. "Don't stand like that! You frighten me!"</p>
    <p>Everyone in the room looked up abruptly at her cry, and so were just in time to see a horrifying change take place in Martin's shape. It was an illusion, of course, but an alarming one. His knees slowly bent until he was half-crouching, his shoulders slumped as though bowed by the weight of enormous back and shoulder muscles, and his arms swung forward until their knuckles hung perilously near the floor.</p>
    <p>Nicholas Martin had at last achieved a personality whose ecological norm would put him on a level with Raoul St. Cyr.</p>
    <p>"Nick!" Erika quavered.</p>
    <p>Slowly Martin's jaw protruded till his lower teeth were hideously visible. Gradually his eyelids dropped until he was peering up out of tiny, wicked sockets. Then, slowly, a perfectly shocking grin broadened Mr. Martin's mouth.</p>
    <p>"Erika," he said throatily. "Mine!"</p>
    <p>And with that, he shambled forward, seized the horrified girl in his arms, and bit her on the ear.</p>
    <p>"Oh, Nick," Erika murmured, closing her eyes. "Why didn't you ever--no, no, no! Nick! Stop it! The contract release. We've got to--Nick, what are you doing?" She snatched at Martin's departing form, but too late.</p>
    <p>For all his ungainly and unpleasant gait, Martin covered ground fast. Almost instantly he was clambering over Watt's desk as the most direct route to that startled tycoon. DeeDee looked on, a little surprised. St. Cyr lunged forward.</p>
    <p>"In Mixo-Lydia--" he began. "Ha! So!" He picked up Martin and threw him across the room.</p>
    <p>"Oh, you beast," Erika cried, and flung herself upon the director, beating at his brawny chest. On second thought, she used her shoes on his shins with more effect. St. Cyr, no gentleman, turned her around, pinioned her arms behind her, and glanced up at Watt's alarmed cry.</p>
    <p>"Martin! What are you doing?"</p>
    <p>There was reason for his inquiry. Apparently unhurt by St. Cyr's toss, Martin had hit the floor, rolled over and over like a ball, knocked down a floor-lamp with a crash, and uncurled, with an unpleasant expression on his face. He rose crouching, bandy-legged, his arms swinging low, a snarl curling his lips.</p>
    <p>"You take my mate?" the pithecanthropic Mr. Martin inquired throatily, rapidly losing all touch with the twentieth century. It was a rhetorical question. He picked up the lamp-standard--he did not have to bend to do it--tore off the silk shade as he would have peeled foliage from a tree-limb, and balanced the weapon in his hand. Then he moved forward, carrying the lamp-standard like a spear.</p>
    <p>"I," said Martin, "kill."</p>
    <p>He then endeavored, with the most admirable single-heartedness, to carry out his expressed intention. The first thrust of the blunt, improvised spear rammed into St. Cyr's solar plexus and drove him back against the wall with a booming thud. This seemed to be what Martin wanted. Keeping one end of his spear pressed into the director's belly, he crouched lower, dug his toes into the rug, and did his very best to drill a hole in St. Cyr.</p>
    <p>"Stop it!" cried Watt, flinging himself into the conflict. Ancient reflexes took over. Martin's arm shot out. Watt shot off in the opposite direction.</p>
    <p>The lamp broke.</p>
    <p>Martin looked pensively at the pieces, tentatively began to bite one, changed his mind, and looked at St. Cyr instead. The gasping director, mouthing threats, curses and objections, drew himself up, and shook a huge fist at Martin.</p>
    <p>"I," he announced, "shall kill you with my bare hands. Then I go over to MGM with DeeDee. In Mixo-Lydia--"</p>
    <p>Martin lifted his own fists toward his face. He regarded them. He unclenched them slowly, while a terrible grin spread across his face. And then, with every tooth showing, and with the hungry gleam of a mad tiger in his tiny little eyes, he lifted his gaze to St. Cyr's throat.</p>
    <p>Mammoth-Slayer was not the son of the Great Hairy One for nothing.</p>
    <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
    <p>Martin sprang.</p>
    <p>So did St. Cyr--in another direction, screaming with sudden terror. For, after all, he was only a medievalist. The feudal man is far more civilized than the so-called man of Mammoth-Slayer's primordially direct era, and as a man recoils from a small but murderous wildcat, so St. Cyr fled in sudden civilized horror from an attacker who was, literally, afraid of nothing.</p>
    <p>He sprang through the window and, shrieking, vanished into the night.</p>
    <p>Martin was taken by surprise. When Mammoth-Slayer leaped at an enemy, the enemy leaped at him too, and so Martin's head slammed against the wall with disconcerting force. Dimly he heard diminishing, terrified cries. Laboriously he crawled to his feet and set back against the wall, snarling, quite ready....</p>
    <p>"Nick!" Erika's voice called. "Nick, it's me! Stop it! Stop it! DeeDee--"</p>
    <p>"Ugh?" Martin said thickly, shaking his head. "Kill." He growled softly, blinking through red-rimmed little eyes at the scene around him. It swam back slowly into focus. Erika was struggling with DeeDee near the window.</p>
    <p>"You let me go," DeeDee cried. "Where Raoul goes, I go."</p>
    <p>"DeeDee!" pleaded a new voice. Martin glanced aside to see Tolliver Watt crumpled in a corner, a crushed lamp-shade half obscuring his face.</p>
    <p>With a violent effort Martin straightened up. Walking upright seemed unnatural, somehow, but it helped submerge Mammoth-Slayer's worst instincts. Besides, with St. Cyr gone, stresses were slowly subsiding, so that Mammoth-Slayer's dominant trait was receding from the active foreground.</p>
    <p>Martin tested his tongue cautiously, relieved to find he was still capable of human speech.</p>
    <p>"Uh," he said. "Arrgh ... ah. Watt."</p>
    <p>Watt blinked at him anxiously through the lamp-shade.</p>
    <p>"Urgh ... Ur--release," Martin said, with a violent effort. "Contract release. Gimme."</p>
    <p>Watt had courage. He crawled to his feet, removing the lamp-shade.</p>
    <p>"Contract release!" he snapped. "You madman! Don't you realize what you've done? DeeDee's walking out on me. DeeDee, don't go. We will bring Raoul back--"</p>
    <p>"Raoul told me to quit if he quit," DeeDee said stubbornly.</p>
    <p>"You don't have to do what St. Cyr tells you," Erika said, hanging onto the struggling star.</p>
    <p>"Don't I?" DeeDee asked, astonished. "Yes, I do. I always have."</p>
    <p>"DeeDee," Watt said frantically, "I'll give you the finest contract on earth--a ten-year contract--look, here it is." He tore out a well-creased document. "All you have to do is sign, and you can have anything you want. Wouldn't you like that?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, yes," DeeDee said. "But Raoul wouldn't like it." She broke free from Erika.</p>
    <p>"Martin!" Watt told the playwright frantically, "Get St. Cyr back. Apologize to him. I don't care how, but get him back! If you don't, I--I'll never give you your release."</p>
    <p>Martin was observed to slump slightly--perhaps with hopelessness. Then, again, perhaps not.</p>
    <p>"I'm sorry," DeeDee said. "I liked working for you, Tolliver. But I have to do what Raoul says, of course." And she moved toward the window.</p>
    <p>Martin had slumped further down, till his knuckles quite brushed the rug. His angry little eyes, glowing with baffled rage, were fixed on DeeDee. Slowly his lips peeled back, exposing every tooth in his head.</p>
    <p>"You," he said, in an ominous growl.</p>
    <p>DeeDee paused, but only briefly.</p>
    <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
    <p>Then the enraged roar of a wild beast reverberated through the room. "You come back!" bellowed the infuriated Mammoth-Slayer, and with one agile bound sprang to the window, seized DeeDee and slung her under one arm. Wheeling, he glared jealously at the shrinking Watt and reached for Erika. In a trice he had the struggling forms of both girls captive, one under each arm. His wicked little eyes glanced from one to another. Then, playing no favorites, he bit each quickly on the ear.</p>
    <p>"Nick!" Erika cried. "How dare you!"</p>
    <p>"Mine," Mammoth-Slayer informed her hoarsely.</p>
    <p>"You bet I am," Erika said, "but that works both ways. Put down that hussy you've got under your other arm."</p>
    <p>Mammoth-Slayer was observed to eye DeeDee doubtfully.</p>
    <p>"Well," Erika said tartly, "make up your mind."</p>
    <p>"Both," said the uncivilized playwright. "Yes."</p>
    <p>"No!" Erika said.</p>
    <p>"Yes," DeeDee breathed in an entirely new tone. Limp as a dishrag, the lovely creature hung from Martin's arm and gazed up at her captor with idolatrous admiration.</p>
    <p>"Oh, you hussy," Erika said. "What about St. Cyr?"</p>
    <p>"Him," DeeDee said scornfully. "He hasn't got a thing, the sissy. I'll never look at him again." She turned her adoring gaze back to Martin.</p>
    <p>"Pah," the latter grunted, tossing DeeDee into Watt's lap. "Yours. Keep her." He grinned approvingly at Erika. "Strong she. Better."</p>
    <p>Both Watt and DeeDee remained motionless, staring at Martin.</p>
    <p>"You," he said, thrusting a finger at DeeDee. "You stay with him. Ha?" He indicated Watt.</p>
    <p>DeeDee nodded in slavish adoration.</p>
    <p>"You sign contract?"</p>
    <p>Nod.</p>
    <p>Martin looked significantly into Watt's eyes. He extended his hand.</p>
    <p>"The contract release," Erika explained, upside-down. "Give it to him before he pulls your head off."</p>
    <p>Slowly Watt pulled the contract release from his pocket and held it out. But Martin was already shambling toward the window. Erika reached back hastily and snatched the document.</p>
    <p>"That was a wonderful act," she told Nick, as they reached the street. "Put me down now. We can find a cab some--"</p>
    <p>"No act," Martin growled. "Real. Till tomorrow. After that--" He shrugged. "But tonight, Mammoth-Slayer." He attempted to climb a palm tree, changed his mind, and shambled on, carrying the now pensive Erika. But it was not until a police car drove past that Erika screamed....</p>
    <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
    <p>"I'll bail you out tomorrow," Erika told Mammoth-Slayer, struggling between two large patrolmen.</p>
    <p>Her words were drowned in an infuriated bellow.</p>
    <p>Thereafter events blurred, to solidify again for the irate Mammoth-Slayer only when he was thrown in a cell, where he picked himself up with a threatening roar. "I kill!" he announced, seizing the bars.</p>
    <p>"Arrrgh!"</p>
    <p>"Two in one night," said a bored voice, moving away outside. "Both in Bel-Air, too. Think they're hopped up? We couldn't get a coherent story out of either one."</p>
    <p>The bars shook. An annoyed voice from one of the bunks said to shut up, and added that there had been already enough trouble from nincompoops without--here it paused, hesitated, and uttered a shrill, sharp, piercing cry.</p>
    <p>Silence prevailed, momentarily, in the cell-block as Mammoth-Slayer, son of the Great Hairy One, turned slowly to face Raoul St. Cyr.</p>

    <p>CHAMELEON MAN</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>He was a changeable sort of fellowand on occasions resembled a piecemeal zombie assembled by someone entirely ignorant of anatomy!</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Tim Vanderhof wavered. He stood ten feet from a glass-paneled door, his apprehensive gaze riveted upon it, and swayed back and forth like a willow. Or, perhaps, an aspen. He wasn't sure. Yes, it was an aspena quaking aspen. His ears seemed to twitch gently as he listened to the low rumble of voices from the inner office of S. Horton Walker, president of The Svelte Shop, Fifth Avenue's snootiest establishment for supplying exclusive models of dresses, lingerie, and what-not.</p>
   <p>Let us examine Mr. Vanderhof. He did not, at the moment, look like a man who, within a very short time, was going to turn into what amounted to something rather like a chameleon. Nevertheless, mentally and spiritually, Tim Vanderhof was a mere mass of quivering protoplasm, and no great wonder, after the interview he had just had. He wasn't bad looking, though slightly pallid. His features were regular, his face a bit chubby, and his eyes held the expression of a startled fawn. They were brown, like his hair, and he had a pug nose.</p>
   <p>He shivered slightly as the glass-paneled door opened. A Back appeared. Under it were two short, slightly bowed legs, and it was surmounted by a scarlet billiard-ball of a head. There was no neck. The Bade was draped in tweeds, and a strong smell of tobacco, brandy, and horses emanated from it.</p>
   <p>The Back extended a large, capable hand, clenched it into a fist, and shook it warningly at someone inside the office.</p>
   <p>"Gad, sir!" a deep voice boomed, "Gad! This is the last straw! Mrs. Quester will be furious. And I warn you, Walker, that I shall be furious too. I have stood enough of your trifling. Twice already you promised exclusive models of a dress for my wife, and then failed to deliver."</p>
   <p>"But" said a Voice.</p>
   <p>"Silence!" bellowed the Back, and the Voice was cowed. "You have promised Model Forty-Three to Mrs. Quester. If you dare to exhibit it at your fashion show this afternoon, I shall call upon you with a riding-whip. I shall be here after the show, and you will have the dress ready for me to take to Mrs. Quester. You have had enough time to make alterations. Gad, sirin Burma I have had men brokenutterly brokenfor less than this."</p>
   <p>The Voice, with a faint spark of antagonism, rallied. It said, "But."</p>
   <p>"But me no buts, damn your eyes! This isn't Burma, but you will find that Colonel Quester still knows how to use his fistsyou tradesman! I shall be back this afternoon, andbrrrrmph!"</p>
   <p>"Yes, Colonel," the Voice assented weakly, and the Back turned, revealing to the watching Vanderhof a round, crimson face with a bristling, iron-gray mustache, and beetling brows from beneath which lightning crackled menacingly. Brrmphing, Colonel Quester moved like a mastodon past the quaking Vanderhof and vanished through a door that seemed to open coweringly of its own accord at the man's advance. Vanderhof immediately turned and started to tiptoe away.</p>
   <p>The Voice detected the sound of his departure. "Vanderhof!" it screamed. "Come here!"</p>
   <p>Thus summoned, the unfortunate official halted, retraced his steps, and entered the inner sanctum. There he paused like a hypnotized rabbit, watching the Voice, who was also known as S. Horton Walker, president of The Svelte Shop.</p>
   <p>A hard man, S. Horton Walker. As a child. he had pulled the wings off butterflies, and maturity had not improved him. He looked like a shaved ape, with a bristling crop of blue-black hair and a gleaming, vicious eye that was now engaged in skinning Vanderhof.</p>
   <p>"UIp," the later remarked, in a conciliatory tone.</p>
   <p>"Don't give me that," Walker growled, crouching behind his desk like the gorilla he resembled. "I told you to keep that so-and-so out of my office. Well?"</p>
   <p>"I said you were out," Vanderhof explained. "II"</p>
   <p>"Youyou" Walker mocked, pointing a stubby sausage of a finger. "Bah! And, again, bah! What the hell are you, a man or a jellyfish?"</p>
   <p>"A man," Vanderhof said hopefully.</p>
   <p>Walker's grunt was profoundly skeptical. "You"re a weakfish. A non-entity. By God, when I was your age I had twenty-nine men under me. By sheer force of personality I made myself what I am today. And I like men with drivepushget-up-and-go."</p>
   <p>Vanderhof, seeing an opportunity of escape, began to get-up-and-go, but relapsed at Walker's furious yelp. "Why, do you realize that Colonel Quester would have punched me in the eye if I hadn't impressed him with my personality? He's an outrageous person."</p>
   <p>"You did promise those exclusive models to his wife though."</p>
   <p>"We get a better price elsewhere," Walker said, and pondered. "But Model Forty-Three will be ready for him when he calls this afternoon. A dangerous man, the colonel. Where was I? Oh, yes. "You're a fool, Vanderhof."</p>
   <p>Vanderhof nodded and looked like a fool. Walker groaned in exasperation. "Haven't you any personality at all? No, you haven't. You're aaa chameleon, that's what. I've noticed that before. When you're talking to a ditch-digger, you act like one yourself. When you're talking to a banker, you turn into a banker. You're a mirror, that's what!"</p>
   <p>It was unfortunate that Vanderhof did not leave at that moment. After his interview with the excitable Colonel Quester, he was mere protoplasm, and somewhat too receptive to suggestion. It was, of course, true, that Vanderhof had little character of his own. He had lost it, after years of associating with the virulent Walker. He was a complete yes-man, and needed only a catalyst to complete a certain chemical reaction that was already taking place.</p>
   <p>"You're a chameleon," Walker said, with emphasis, and his eyes bored into Vanderhof's.</p>
   <p>It was at that precise moment that Mr. Tim Vanderhof turned into a chameleon.</p>
   <p>Not physically, of course. The metamorphosis was far more subtle. Adept for years at assuming the traits of others, Vanderhof was rather shockingly receptive. Though all he did was to sit down in a chair opposite his boss.</p>
   <p>Walker stared, frowned, and hesitated.</p>
   <p>Vanderhof stared, frowned, and didn't say anything.</p>
   <p>Walker lifted a large hand and pointed accusingly.</p>
   <p>Vanderhof lifted a smaller hand and also pointed accusingly.</p>
   <p>Walker flushed. So did Vanderhof.</p>
   <p>The president of The Svelte Shop rose like a behemoth from his chair and growled, "Are you mocking me?"</p>
   <p>Then he stopped, amazed, because Vanderhof had risen and said exactly the same thing.</p>
   <p>"Youyouyou" Walker's face was purple. Vanderhof guessed what was coming. With a mighty effort he asserted what little remained of his will-power.</p>
   <p>"D-don't go on!" he pleaded frantically. "P-please"</p>
   <p>"You chameleon!" S. Horton Walker thundered.</p>
   <p>"You chameleon!" Vanderhof thundered.</p>
   <p>Such bare-faced, impudent mockery was unendurable. Walker quivered in every muscle. "You're fired!" he said. "What's that? What did you say? What do you mean, I'm fired? Stop imitating me, you stupid clown. Don't call me a stupid clown! Nrrgh!"</p>
   <p>"nrrgh! " Vanderhof finished, not quite realizing what was happening to him. Walker sat down weakly. He was shaken a little, but his natural malignancy was still undimmed. A natural snake, S. Horton Walker.</p>
   <p>"I"</p>
   <p>"I" said Vanderhof.</p>
   <p>Walker bellowed, "Shut up!" And, so strong was his will, for the moment Vanderhof remained perfectly quiet.</p>
   <p>"Are you going to get out?" he asked at length, in a low, deadly voice. "Damn it, stop mocking me! I'll have you thrown out! What? Have me thrown out of my own office?"</p>
   <p>Goaded to insensate fury by the fact that Vanderhof was repeating perfectly everything he said and didand, curiously enough, at exactly the same time he said and did itWalker stuck out his thumb to press a button on the desk. It collided with Vanderhof's thumb.</p>
   <p>Walker sat back, palpitating, a mute Vesuvius. Obviously Vanderhof had gone mad. And yet</p>
   <p>"I wish you'd go and drown yourself," said the president, meaning every word. He was somewhat astonished when Tim Vanderhof quietly arose and left the office. He would have been even more surprised had he seen Vanderhof walk down 42nd Street to Times Square, and then board the Brighton Beach subway train bound for Coney Island. Somehow, it is doubtful whether Walker would have regretted the incident or recalled his words. He was evil to the core, and a hard man, as has been mentioned previously. He turned back to his preparations for the exclusive fashion show that afternoon, while the metamorphosed Tim Vanderhof hurried off to go and drown himself.</p>
   <p>Now Tim was really a nice guy. He shot a fair game of golf, had once made ten straight passes while shooting craps at a stag party, and was kind to dogs, blind men, and small children. He explained the latter eccentricity by stating that he had once been a small child himself, which was no doubt true enough. Under other circumstances, Mr. Vanderhof might have achieved a genuine personality of his own, but he had the misfortune always to be associated with rats tike Walker. Self-riadc men invariably contend that they had to fight their way through obstacles, so they create new obstacles for those under them, probably with the best intentions in the world. The fact remains that Walker had provided the ultimate catalyst for Tim Vanderhof, who got off the subway at Coney Islandit had now, by some strange metamorphosis, been transformed into an elevatedand wandered along the boardwalk, peering contemplatively at the ocean.</p>
   <p>It was large, gray, and wet. A great deal of H2O, to put it scientifically. Vanderhof s mind was dulled; he found it difficult to think clearly, and he kept hearing Walker's command over and over again.</p>
   <p>"go and drown yourself. Go and drown yourself."</p>
   <p>The sky was cloudy. It had been a hot day, one of those Turkish bath affairs which make Manhattan, in the summer, a suburb of hell, and so there were vast quantities of people at Coney. Large bulging women lumbered about shepherding brats, who fed voraciously on ice-cream, pickles, hokey-pokey, hot dogs, and similar juicy tidbits. Brawny young men and flimsy girls, hot and perspiring, tried to gulp down air quite as humid as in the city. Meanwhile, the Atlantic Ocean beckoned to Tim Vanderhof.</p>
   <p>His eyes were glazed as he made a beeline for the nearest pier. In the back of his mind a little remnant of sanity shrieked warning, but Vanderhof could not obey. Stripped of the last remnant of personality and will-power, he walked on....</p>
   <p>"go and drown yourself. Go and drown yourself."</p>
   <p>Vanderhof made a mighty effort to break the spell, but it was useless. He walked on, his gaze riveted on the greasy slate-colored water at the end of the pier. Not a man, woman, or child among the crowd noticed him. He tried to call for help, but no sound came from his lips.</p>
   <p>People were running. Rain began to splash down, first in droplets, then in ever-increasing torrents. The gray clouds were fulfilling their promise. People ran, with newspapers over their heads, to the nearest shelter.</p>
   <p>Wavering on the edge of the pier, Vanderhof felt something pull him back. Magnetically he was made to retreat a few staggering steps, He turned. He started to walk back along the wharf, then he was running with the rest of the crowd. No longer did he hear Walker's voice demanding suicide. In its place was an urgent whisper that said:</p>
   <p>"Run! Run!"</p>
   <p>Hundreds of men, women, and children were rushing to shelter. The effect of this mass hegira was too much for the human chameleon. A wave seemed to bear him along with the others. Vainly he tried to struggle against the impulse. No use, of course. Rain splashed in his face.</p>
   <p>It was like running in a dream, without conscious volition. Lines of force seemed to drag him onward. Off the pier. On the boardwalk, and along it, in the midst of the crowd. As various members of the mob dived for shelter, poor Vanderhof was tossed about like a leaf in a gale. A group leaped into a hot-dog stand, and Vanderhof veered after them. Then a larger group came past, and he skittered in their wake, utterly helpless.</p>
   <p>They entered Luna Park, and he perforce followed.</p>
   <p>Somehow he was caught in the eddy, and found himself, limp and perspiring, in a penny arcade, almost deserted. A semblance of sanity came back to him. Gasping and drenched to the skin, Vanderhof cowered behind a "grind-box" labeled "Paris NightFor Men Only," and wondered what in hell was happening to him.</p>
   <p>He tried to think. What had Walker said? A human chameleon. It seemed to have come true. Adept for years at assuming the traits of others, the ultimate transformation had taken place, ever he looked at anyone now, he assumed the traits of that person.</p>
   <p>It was really far worse, only Vanderhof didn't realize it quite yet.</p>
   <p>Logically, the only solution was to stay away from people. A man without personality is bound to reflect the personality of others. Vanderhof peeped out, looking glumly at a rotund little man with white whiskers who was standing at the entrance to the arcade, staring virtuously at nothing. A pleasant little man, he thought. He probably had not a worry in the world. Vanderhof wished he were that man.</p>
   <p>He was startled by the sound of footsteps, and even more startled when a veritable giantess of a woman smacked him over the head with her umbrella. The unfortunate Vanderhof reeled, seeing stars. He gasped, "W-w-wha"</p>
   <p>"Worm!" the Amazon boomed. "I told you not to enter thisthis peep-show!" Her voice quivered with menace. Utterly at a loss, Vanderhof raised his hand to his stinging head, but it was entrapped halfway in what seemed to be a maze of dangling spaghetti. He investigated. It was a set of white whiskers, exactly like the man at whom he had been lookingonly the whiskers were on Vanderhofs face!</p>
   <p>The giantess had turned momentarily to wither the arcade with a glance, and Vanderhof caught sight of himself in a nearby mirror. It did not, however, much resemble Tim Vanderhof. What he saw was a rotund little man with white whiskers.</p>
   <p>With an astonished shriek Vanderhof turned back to his normal self. The apparition in the mirror resumed its usual and familiar semblance. It was again Tim Vanderhof.</p>
   <p>"Oh, my God," the man murmured faintly. "I'm dreaming."</p>
   <p>"What?" The Amazon turned, her umbrella raised. Then her eyes dilated. How the devil had her husband managed to get out of sight so suddenly, leaving an utter stranger in place of himself? She didn't know. She stared balefully at Vanderhof, who shrank back, his eyes on the umbrella.</p>
   <p>Just then the giantess caught sight of the fat little man at the arcade's entrance. She turned, lumbering away. This time she disdained the use of the umbrella. Going, apparently, on a variation of the principle that fingers were made before forks, she lifted a ham-like hand and smote the, fat little man athwart the ear. The beard rippled like a white banner as the wretched creature was hurled out into the rain.</p>
   <p>He raised himself from the mud and dazedly contemplated his wife. She had never before struck him without good causewhat she considered good cause, anyway. If she was going to beat him on sudden, mad impulses, the future would be dark indeed, thought the fat little man.</p>
   <p>He rose and ran rapidly away.</p>
   <p>The giantess followed, crying threats.</p>
   <p>Tim Vanderhof shuddered convulsively. He was going insane. Or else.... No, it was too ghastly. He couldn't be a jellyfish as well as a chameleon. He might, perhaps, assume the traits of somebody else, but he couldn't acquire their actual physical appearance as well!</p>
   <p>"No," Vanderhof said urgently. "Pleaseno!"</p>
   <p>Yet it was profoundly and disturbingly logical. He had looked at the fat little man, and had become the fat little man, white whiskers and all. The shock of seeing himself in the mirror had caused him to return to a more normal appearance. What would be the ultimate result? Would Tim Vanderhof fade into a shadowa mere thing? Yipe.</p>
   <p>Such was the cry that burst from Vanderhof's dry throat at the very prospect. He couldn't go about the world turning into everybody he met. And yetchameleons did it, in so far as pigmentation went. A specialized animal like a man might go even further. The powers of the mind and the will were unplumbed. Vanderhof knew that, from much perusal of Sunday supplements and science-fiction magazines. Recalling stories he had read by such authors as H. G. Wells, Jules Verne, and Henry Kuttner, he groaned as he realized that the heroes of such tales usually met a sticky end.</p>
   <p>"Oh, no!" Vanderhof whispered involuntarily. "I don't want to die. I'm too young to die."</p>
   <p>Footsteps clumped into the arcade. Hurriedly Vanderhof whirled, burying his face in the nearest slot-machine, which featured a presumably authentic reel telling how native women were kidnapped by gorillas in the Congo. It was neither natural shyness nor a genuine interest in anthropology which caused Vanderhof's sudden retreat. He feared to face anyone, believing, logically enough, that he might turn into that person.</p>
   <p>He dropped a penny in the slot and whirled the crank, scarcely seeing the faded cards that flickered into view and out again inside the machine. A gorilla was engaged in wandering through its native jungle.</p>
   <p>Someone behind Vanderhof began to laugh maniacally. His cries rose into shrill screams.</p>
   <p>There were answering, inquiring shouts. Feet thudded. Someone called, "What's the matter there."</p>
   <p>"A monkey!" came the hysterical response. "There's a gorilla looking at dirty pictures! I've got the jumping jitters again!"</p>
   <p>Vanderhof hurriedly turned to face a tall, skinny man with a horselike face and bloodshot eyes. He carried a cane and apparently a large cargo of Scotch.</p>
   <p>"It's coming after me!" the man screeched, retreating. "First snakes, and now this. Ah-h, those awful glaring eyes!"</p>
   <p>"Sh-h!" said Vanderhof, lifting a placating hand. The drunk shivered in every limb.</p>
   <p>"It hisses like a snake!" he cried, and thrust out the cane like a fencer. Its metal tip caught Vanderhof in the middle, and he doubled up, breathless and gasping. And, simultaneously, he saw himself in a mirror.</p>
   <p>It didn't look like Tim Vanderhof. It was wearing Tim Vanderhof's clothes, but it was, unquestionably a gorillathe kind that kidnap native women in the Congo. The sound of footsteps grew louder. The new arrivals were almost at the arcade.</p>
   <p>Vanderhof put forth a mighty effort of will, inadvertently baring his fangs. The drunk emitted a short, sharp cry and covered his eyes. But Vanderhof ignored him. He was glaring, wildly, at the mirror.</p>
   <p>And, suddenly, the gorilla was gone. Vanderhof was himself again.</p>
   <p>Tenderly rubbing his stomach, Vanderhof straightened to meet the red-rimmed gaze of the horse-faced man.</p>
   <p>"Where is it?'* the latter babbled. "Where did it go?"</p>
   <p>"Where did what go?" Vanderhof asked coldly, still maintaining the mental effort that enabled him to keep his rightful form.</p>
   <p>"The gorilla" There was a pause as people poured into the arcade, asking questions. There was confusion and tumult. And shouting. This died, eventually, as Vanderhof indicated the horse-faced man and explained that he was drunk.</p>
   <p>"I'm not that drunk," was the surly response. "Snakes, yes. But not gorillas. Where is it? I know." The man's glazed eyes brightened. "You hid it!"</p>
   <p>"You're drunk," Vanderhof said.</p>
   <p>"Yeah? For two cents I'd punch your face in. Gr-r!" His confusion crystallized into belligerency, the drunk rolled forward, waving the cane. Vanderhof fled</p>
   <p>It was a hard life, he thought dismally, as he slunk through Luna Park, carefully avoiding crowds. The rain had stopped now, but people were still wary. This was all to the good. Vanderhof could, he found, retain his normal shape by putting forth a strong mental effort, but this could not be kept up for long. Already he felt weak.</p>
   <p>Yet, at the back of his mind, a queer, perverse excitement was slowly, imperceptibly growing. In a way, it was rather fun. Imagine being able to turn yourself into a gorilla! Everybody was afraid of gorillas!</p>
   <p>People shot them, too, Vanderhof recalled, and shut his eyes. He wavered, hearing faintly the tones of a hoarse, rasping voice that plucked at his nerves. It was likelikewhat?"</p>
   <p>Like Walker's voice. Urgentcommanding. Demanding that he do something</p>
   <p>He opened his eyes and found himself before a side-show. The barker stood above him on a box, derby tilted back, checkered suit, garish, thrusting out a commanding finger.</p>
   <p>"C'mon, folks! Here it is, greatest sideshow on Earth! Tiniest dwarf ever born of woman, tallest giant since Creation, all the wonders of the Universe gathered here for your inspection. Step inside! You, thereonly a dime. Step right forward, mister! The girl will take your dime!"</p>
   <p>"No!" Vanderhof squeaked faintly, and tried to retreat. Instead, he found himself walking forward.</p>
   <p>"Right this way, mister! Pay your dime! R-r-right in here! Step inside"</p>
   <p>Vanderhof found a dime and paid the admission charge. He didn't want to go into the side-show. He had a singularly horrid idea of what might happen there. But the barker's will-power was too strong for him,, and he could no longer exert the mental effort that partially insulated him from danger. He was exhausted.</p>
   <p>"I'm a jellyfish," poor Vanderhof "mourned as he entered the show. "That's what I am. Walker was right. Oh, damn!" he ended futilely, tears of frustrated rage in his eyes. "I wish this would stop!"</p>
   <p>But wishing didn't do any good. The chameleon man found himself in the sideshowsurrounded by freaks!</p>
   <p>He caught one glimpse of innumerable peopleterrifying to him, under the circumstancesranged around the big room, and then fled through a doorway on his right. It was definitely no time to face giants, dwarfs, dog-faced boys, or wild men from Sumatra. Vanderhof wanted only peace and quiet.</p>
   <p>He got neither.</p>
   <p>He found himself in a small anteroom containing a mirror and a dwarf. The latter whirled and snapped. "Didn't you see the sign over the door? This is private! I-huh?"</p>
   <p>He stopped talking, and presently resumed. "Say, that's a clever trick. Are you one of the boys? A magician, huh?"</p>
   <p>"Yeah," said the now dwarfish Mr. Vanderhof. "I d-do it with mirrors."</p>
   <p>"Damn good," returned the little man, whose name was Bingo. "Wait a minute. I want Ajax to see this."</p>
   <p>"Don't bother," Vanderhof started, but he was too late. Bingo whistled, and immediately the room was darkened by the shadow of Ajax, who was seven feet nine inches tall, and would have had no need for snowshoes.</p>
   <p>Vanderhof shut his eyes. He tried to assert his will-power, or what little remained of it, and was rewarded with pleased noises from giant and dwarf. "Clever!" said the latter. "Did you see that? He was little a minute ago. Now he isn't."</p>
   <p>"That's right," the giant rumbled. "He looked like you, too, Bingo. Did you notice? Who are you, Mister?"'</p>
   <p>"I wish I knew," Vanderhof gasped, feeling lost and helpless. He dared not open his eyes. He was again in his normal semblance, but the very sight of either Ajax or Bingo might cause another metamorphosis.</p>
   <p>"You!" a new voice broke inone familiar to Vanderhof as that of the drunk in the arcade. "I been looking for you. I want to punch you in the snoot."</p>
   <p>Vanderhof, feeling set-upon, almost had a mad impulse to sock the drunk, but habit prevailed. He took refuge in flight, or tried to. Unfortunately, he ran into the mirror, bumped his nose, and turned, opening his eyes.</p>
   <p>He saw Ajax and Bingo.</p>
   <p>The drunk lunged forward, lifting his cane. Then he halted, and a scream of stark terror burst from his throat.</p>
   <p>"Yaaaah!" he shrieked. Apparently considering this an insufficient comment, he threw up his hands and added, "Waaaah!"</p>
   <p>He fled, leaving a memento in the form of his cane, which he flung at Vanderhof with unerring aim. Nose and cane collided.</p>
   <p>Ajax and Bingo whistled in chorus: 'Wow!" said the latter. "Didja see that? Mister, you're good! You almost scared me."</p>
   <p>Vanderhof, tears of pain in his eyes, turned to the mirror. "Yeah," he said in a shaky voice. "You may not believe it, but I'm scaring myself. Am I crazy, or do I look like both of you?"</p>
   <p>"Well," the dwarf said judiciously, "the top part of you looks like me, but the bottom half looks like Ajax. I don't see how you do it. You must be on the big time."</p>
   <p>Vanderhof was silent, considering the impossible reflection in the mirror. From the waist up he was Bingo, the dwarf. His lower extremities were those of a giant. The result was harrowing in the extreme. It was like putting a chameleon on Scotch plaid.</p>
   <p>With a mighty effort he resumed his normal appearance. There were cries of amazement and appreciation from his companions. Leaving them to their simple pleasures, Vanderhof walked unsteadily back into the main show. He was bound for fresh airlots of it. And peace.</p>
   <p>Chameleons, however, do not lead peaceful lives, contrary to the opinions of some. The unexpected is always happening.</p>
   <p>As Vanderhof crossed the big room, he was trying to understand what had happened. He had assumed the outward appearance of two people at the same timeabnormal people at that. Things were getting worse. Ajax and Bingo. Bingo and Ajax. Giant and</p>
   <p>Whup! Vanderhof had entered another room, over the doorway of which was a sign reading, "Magic Mirrors," and paused, facing the only normal mirror in the place. He was looking at the same conglomeration of dwarf and giant that he had viewed before.</p>
   <p>Good Lord! Could he change his shape by merelythinking? The thought was appalling, yet it possessed a curious, perverse fascination for Vanderhof. Standing perfectly motionless, he concentrated on his own normal self.</p>
   <p>And there was the reflection of Tim Vanderhof facing him!</p>
   <p>That, at least, was a relief. But, feeling slightly safer now, Vanderhof didn't stop. He wanted to make sure. He thought of the side-show barker outside, and visualized him mentally. Derby hat, cigar, checkered suit.</p>
   <p>The reflection in the glass showed the barker, though there was neither derby, cigar, nor checkered suit. Apparently only Vanderhof himself could change. His clothing remained unaltered. That was natural enough.</p>
   <p>He returned to his normal self.</p>
   <p>"You!" said a familiar voice. "I been looking for you! None of your tricks, now! I wanna punch your nose."</p>
   <p>"Oh, my goodness!" Vanderhof said, turning. "You again!"</p>
   <p>"Yeah!" said the drunk belligerently. "Wanna make something out of it?" He lifted the cane and advanced. Vanderhof, perforce, retreated into the room of Magic Mirrors. He found liimself being backed into a corner, his fascinated gaze riveted on the cane. Its metal tip looked extremely hard. The drunk had recovered it, or else acquired a new one. In any case, it seemed to be a dangerous weapon.</p>
   <p>The horsey face bore a malignant expression. "I'm gonna smash you," it said, and thrust itself forward. Vanderhof backed away, feeling the cold surface of a mirror at his back. He was trapped. The room was empty. No use to call for help. The din from the next room, where a band was loudly playing, would drown any but the loudest shrieks.</p>
   <p>Abruptly Vanderhof felt irritation. His stomach was still sore from the cane's tip, and his nose, too, was aching. He said, "Go away."</p>
   <p>"No," the drunk growled. "I'm gonna smash you."</p>
   <p>Sudden, violent rage boiled up in Vanderhof. He thought of Ajax and Bingo. If they were there, they'd help him. But</p>
   <p>Vanderhof thought diligently, visualizing giant and dwarf. From the startled look that came over the drunk, he realized that the metamorphosis had once again taken place.</p>
   <p>He stepped forward, warily at first, and the horse-faced man retreated.</p>
   <p>At that precise moment Vanderhof caught sight of himself in one of the mirrors that lined the place. The change was not quite the same as before. This time, from the waist down, Vanderhof was Bingo, the dwarf. His upper portion resembled Ajax the giant.</p>
   <p>Nor was that the worst. The mirror that reflected the insane image was no normal one. It was a distorting mirror, designed to cause laughter by warping and twisting images. Concave, it reflected Vanderhof not only as a half-giant, half-dwarf, but as a swooping arca being bent like a bow, such as had never before existed on Earth.</p>
   <p>The drunk shrieked. "No, no!" he babbled. "Not that!"</p>
   <p>Vanderhof realized that he had taken on the attributes of the distorted image. He glanced at the cowering horse-faced man, and felt a warm glow of triumph.</p>
   <p>It faded as he was punched in the stomach by the cane.</p>
   <p>Vanderhof got mad. He said, with slow emphasis, "Okay. You asked for it. Now you're going toget it!"</p>
   <p>The other showed his teeth.</p>
   <p>Vanderhof looked at the nearest mirror. The result was shocking, but did not quite satisfy him. He looked at another, and then another, after that turning to confront his enemy.</p>
   <p>Not even Samson could have faced the chaotic Vanderhof without screaming then. He looked like a piecemeal zombie assembled by someone with no knowledge of anatomy. One leg was six feet longer than the other. He had five arms. His chest was like a balloon, and his waist measured perhaps three inches around.</p>
   <p>His head resembled a fried egg that had broken in the pan. The mouth was, oddly enough, in the forehead, and there was a tasty assortment of eyes scattered around them, all of these glaring furiously. He towered to the ceiling, and the horse-faced man, giving up all thought of hostility, skittered away like a rabbit.</p>
   <p>"Go 'way!" he babbled. "Don't touch me! You're not human, that's what you ain't!"</p>
   <p>"You don't get out of it that easily," Vanderhof snapped, barring the door with a fifteen-foot arm. "What do you think I am, anyhow?"</p>
   <p>"The devil himself," said the drunk, with a flash of sudden insight. "Awrrrgh! Don't do that!"</p>
   <p>"I'll do it again," Vanderhof announced, and a scream of pain from the drunk bore testimony to the fact that he had done it again. "Thus."</p>
   <p>The wild and impassioned shrieks of the horse-faced man bore fruit. Vanderhof heard faint cries from behind him. He turned to see faces peering in through the door.</p>
   <p>They went white and drew back. Someone cried, "A freak! He's gone mad!"</p>
   <p>"He's murdering me!" the drunk announced. "Help!"</p>
   <p>Heartened by reinforcements, he made the mistake of prodding Vanderhof from the rear with his cane. At this all semblance of sanity departed from Tim Vanderhof. Completely forgetting everything else, he bent all his energies to the task of reducing the horse-faced man to a state of babbling idiocy.</p>
   <p>"Give me that cane!" he grated.</p>
   <p>"So you can ram it down my throat?" came the prescient reply. "I won't."</p>
   <p>At this Vanderhof looked in a mirror, sprouted another arm, grew two feet, and advanced toward his opponent. He got the cane and broke it into six pieces. One in each hand, he commenced to tattoo a rhythm on the drunk.</p>
   <p>This wasn't quite satisfactory, so he gave it up, and concentrated on scaring the wretched man to death. Never was any revenge more horrifying or complete. Vanderhof felt a random sense of warning; it might be wiser, safer, to leave now, before more trouble arrived. Butwhat the hell!</p>
   <p>He grinned, and the horse-faced man bellowed in anguish. "He's going to eat me!" he cried. "Don't let him eat me!"</p>
   <p>"There they are," someone observed. "In there, Sergeant. It's a freak. Quite mad."</p>
   <p>"It's a freak, all right," said a gruff voice. "But I'm thinking that I'm the looney one. Will you look at the horrid thing!"</p>
   <p>"I've been looking at it for ten minutes," said the other voice. "Ever since I turned in the alarm. You've got your squad with you. Arrest him before he kills that man."</p>
   <p>Vanderhof turned. The doorway held a burly, grizzled oldster in police uniform, and behind him a group of plainclothes men, their profession easily established by a glance at their feet. There were guns.</p>
   <p>He was sent staggering. The horsefaced man had made a break for freedom. Vanderhof, boiling with rage, plunged in pursuit. There was chaos on the threshold; then Vanderhof was past, and racing after his victim.</p>
   <p>A bullet whistled past his ear.</p>
   <p>Oh-oh! This altered matters. Vanderhof, hidden momentarily behind the bandstand, paused, looking around. He saw no one the horse-faced man had vanishedbut heard voices.</p>
   <p>"He went behind thereget himguns ready, men!"</p>
   <p>Vanderhof thought hard. He visualized the drunk. And, instantly, he assumed the appearance of the drunk.</p>
   <p>He ran out from behind the bandstand, almost colliding with the sergeant and a plainclothes man with him.</p>
   <p>"Hey"</p>
   <p>"He went that way!" Vanderhof cried. "After him! Don't let him get away!"</p>
   <p>Without waiting for an answer, he ran for the exit. There was startled silence, and then the sergeant and his crew raced in pursuit.</p>
   <p>Vanderhof leaped out into the open air, flattened himself against the wall of the building, and concentrated on the face of the plainclothes man who had accompanied the sergeant. And, of course, the inevitable happened.</p>
   <p>The sergeant appeared. He cast a swift glance at Vanderhof.</p>
   <p>"Where is he, Clancy?" he bellowed. "Which way did he go?"</p>
   <p>"There!" said the pseudo-Clancy, and pointed. He was borne away in a mob of detectives who gushed out of the exit. All of them were busily searching for a freak with six arms and an impossible heada freak who no longer existed!</p>
   <p>Ten minutes later Vanderhof, in his normal guise, was on the train bound back for Manhattan. It had been easy to drift away from the detectives, who naturally suspected nothing. And, after that, Vanderhof wanted only to get away from Coney Island. His nerves were in bad shape. He needed a rest.</p>
   <p>So, illogically enough, he went back to New York.</p>
   <p>He was still angry about the horse-faced man. He would have dearly loved to have taken another poke at the guy. But the police had interrupted. Vanderhof's resentment wandered, and finally focused on a man with bristling blue-black hair and a vicious gleam in his eyes. The guy looked uncommonly like S. Horton Walker, president of The Svelte Shop.</p>
   <p>Walkernuts to Walker, Vanderhof thought. "Fire me, will he?" the chameleon man brooded. "Just on account of Colonel Quester! Tchah!" The fashion show would be going on soon, he remembered. And, simultaneously with the thought, Vanderhof grinned.</p>
   <p>A singularly malicious and unpleasant grin....</p>
   <p>"Fire me, will he?" he asked rhetorically, turning into Ajax for a brief moment. "I'll fix him!"</p>
   <p>While making his way toward the Fifth Avenue store, he pondered. He was achieving some sort of mastery over his chameleon-like changes. If he visualized a person, he could become that personthough his clothing never altered. And, with an effort of will, he could resume his normal form. Good enough. What now?</p>
   <p>The fashion show was in full swing when Vanderhof slipped quietly into The Svelte Shop, unobtrusively making his way behind the scenes. Dowagers and damsels in tons of jewelry were sitting about, feeding on canapes and hors d'ouevres. while all sorts and conditions of men waited uneasily upon their respective daughters, wives, and lady friends. Park Avenue had turned out in force for the initial showing of exclusive gowns by The Svelte Shop. Mannequins were gliding along the runways, and over all presided the figure of S. Horton Walker, resplendent in specially-tailored garments, and looking more than ever like a shaved ape.</p>
   <p>"And Model Twelve?" a slightly decayed socialite inquired from above her tiers of chins. "The exclusive Model Twelve, Mr. Walker?"</p>
   <p>"Soon," said Walker, rubbing his hands. "Very soon, Mrs. Smythe-Kennicott-Smythe."</p>
   <p>Peering through drapes of wine-colored fabric, Vanderhof sucked in his lower lip. Model Twelve was already famous.</p>
   <p>It was super-exclusive. Only one gown on this model had been created. And, when it showed, the bidding would be highalmost like an auction, though, of course, most genteel. Mrs. Smythe-Kennicott-Smythe would probably get it. She was the wealthiest woman in New York, and cream on the elite's upper crust, to put it mildly.</p>
   <p>"Nuts to you, Mr. Walker," Vanderhof said silently, and fled. He made his way to the dressing-rooms, pausing at sight of Susan Vail; the shop's loveliest model. The girl nodded, smiled, and went on her way.</p>
   <p>Vanderhof visualized her. Suddenly he was gone. A perfect duplicate of Susan Vail stood in the passage, looking rather odd in Tim Vandcrhof's garments.</p>
   <p>"Now for Model Twelve. It was carefully stored away, but Vanderhof knew where to look. Tenderly, almost reverently, he drew it from its hiding-place, and held up the gown. It was a gorgeous creationone that would transform any woman.</p>
   <p>"Why, Susan," a soft voice said, "what are you doing in those clothes?"</p>
   <p>Vanderhof turned hurriedly, to confront a small brown-haired model with wide eyes. "I"</p>
   <p>"And what's the matter with your voice? Got a cold?"</p>
   <p>"No," said Vanderhof shrilly. "Itit's just a gag." Seizing Model Twelve, he fled into the nearest dressing-room.</p>
   <p>A few minutes later he came out, wearing the gown. Since he looked exactly like Susan Vail, it wasn't at all unbecoming. But his plans weren't finished yet. He wanted to perform an experiment.</p>
   <p>He entered a room replete with tall mirrors, reflecting him from various angles. And he concentrated. If he could become two men at once, surely he could transform himself into two or more Susan Vails.</p>
   <p>The results were beyond all expectations. From every angle Susan Vails materialized. They appeared like rabbits out of a hat. And all of them wore Model Twelve.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, Walker was preening himself as he made the announcement for which everyone was waiting.</p>
   <p>"And now, ladies and gentlemen, the event of the afternoon. At great expense, we have secured an ultra-exclusive modela veritable symphony. There is only one like it in the world."</p>
   <p>"How do we know that?" asked a skeptical man with sideburns.</p>
   <p>Walker turned a hurt stare upon him. "The Svelte Shop stands ready to guarantee my statement. Our integrity has never been questioned. And nowModel Twelve!"</p>
   <p>He flung out an arm toward the runway. The curtains shook convulsively. Through them appeared Susan Vail. A soft gasp went up from the women at sight of Model Twelve.</p>
   <p>Then another gasp went up. Another Susan Vail had slipped through the curtains and was following in the track of the first. She, too, wore Model Twelve.</p>
   <p>"Hey" said the skeptical man with sideburns.</p>
   <p>He stopped. A third Model Twelve was coming.</p>
   <p>Then another. And another!</p>
   <p>"My God!" the skeptical man gasped. "Quintuplets!"</p>
   <p>Walker had turned a delicate shade of mauve. Cries of outraged fury went up from the audience. "Exclusive model," somebody snapped. "Hah!"</p>
   <p>Meanwhile the army of Model Twelves was marching steadily through the curtains. The room was filled with them. Walker was clawing at his hair and making gurgling sounds. Mrs. Smythe-Kennicott-Smythe arose, waggled her chins haughtily, and departed.</p>
   <p>"One might as well shop in the five-and-ten," she observed.</p>
   <p>"It's sabotage! " Walker whispered faintly. "B-boring from within"</p>
   <p>His eyes brightened a trifle. Mrs. Smythe-Kennicott-Smythe had reconsidered. She wasn't leaving, after all. She was returning, her eyes very wide, and behind her was a large, bulky man with a mask on his face.</p>
   <p>Other men arrived. Five of them. And they had guns, and were masked.</p>
   <p>"This," said the leader, "is a stick-up. Squat, beetle-puss." He pushed Mrs. Smythe-Kennicott-Smythe into a chair. "And keep your trap shut. That goes for all of you." He waved a gleaming automatic. "Cover the exits, boys."</p>
   <p>The boys obeyed. The guests sat, frozen with horror. One dowager attempted to swallow her diamonds, but was dissuaded. Walker gasped for air.</p>
   <p>"This will ruin me!" he squawked. "My customersmy clients, I mean"</p>
   <p>"Shaddap," remarked the big man. "Or I'll let you have it. Don't anybody move. Frisk 'em, boys."</p>
   <p>One of the boys produced a canvas bag and made the rounds, collecting whatever and money he could unearth. A pearl necklace, the existence of which had heretofore gone unsuspected, was revealed when Mrs. Smythe-Kennicott-Smythe was compelled to stare ceiling-ward.</p>
   <p>"Hey!" said one of the boys. "What the hellwhatulp!"</p>
   <p>"Lcok!" he finished. "Jeez, booslook!"</p>
   <p>The big man looked. He, too, stared. Model Twelve was in action.</p>
   <p>There were about twenty Susan Vails lined up on the runway. The last of them had stepped forward andmergedwith the one in front of her. This, Vanderhof had found, was the only way of consolidating his various images. He merely had to walk into himself.</p>
   <p>The nineteenth Susan Vail merged with the eighteenth. And the eighteenth stepped forward</p>
   <p>Nobody else moved.</p>
   <p>There was a stricken silence as the fifteenth Susan Vail became the fourteenthand so onthe third became the second; there was only one Susan Vail now.</p>
   <p>She hurried toward the exit.</p>
   <p>But now the stasis broke. One of the thugs barred her path, lifting his gun menacingly.</p>
   <p>Susan Vailor Vanderhofveered aside, toward an ante-room lined with mirrors. She ducked into it and slid die curtain in place after her.</p>
   <p>The leader snapped, "Get her, Phil."</p>
   <p>Phil said reluctantly, "There ain't no way for her to get outa there."</p>
   <p>"I said"</p>
   <p>"Okay," Phil placated. "Just gimme time. That dame ain't normal."</p>
   <p>He moved forward, gun lifted. His hand touched the curtain. Then he turned. "Boss, there ain't nothing in there but a lot of mirrors. What's the use"</p>
   <p>"You heard me!" the boss yelped.</p>
   <p>"Okay," said Phil, and yanked the curtain aside.</p>
   <p>Apparently there was another way out of the ante-room, for Susan Vail wasn't there any more. Instead, there were fifteen men, and they all looked exactly like Tim Vanderhof. Oddly enough, they all wore Model Twelve.</p>
   <p>"Yaah!" said Phil shrilly, staggering back.</p>
   <p>Two Tim Vanderhof s sprang upon him. One struck the gun from his hand, while the other planted a hard fist on Phil's jaw. The thug folded up limply.</p>
   <p>One Vanderhof had pulled the curtain back into place, but Vanderhofs were emerging through it in twos, threes, and dozens. The room was suddenly flooded with Vanderhofs, all wearing Model Twelve. It was as though the ante-room had suddenly decided to give birth. It erupted Vanderhofs. It spewed them forth, and as fast as they emerged new ones followed. For there were many mirrors in that little room.</p>
   <p>The element of surprise was in Vanderhof's favor. The crooks were struck dumb by this insane manifestation of men in evening gowns. Before they could recover, each one found himself borne down under a tangle of slugging, punching, kicking, homicidally-active Vanderhofs.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Smythe-Kennicott-Smythe threw up her hands in hob horror. A Vanderhof paused to chuck her under the chins. "Keep your shirt on, babe," he advised. "I'll get your jewels back."</p>
   <p>The lady fainted.</p>
   <p>Not all the Vanderhofs were engaged in taking care of the crooks. Twenty of them had mounted the runway and were delicately parading, showing off Model Twelve, which, to say the least, looked rather startling on Tim Vanderhofs masculine figure. A half-dozen more had surrounded the pallid, paralyzed Walker and were engaged in making horrific faces at him. Another group of Vanderhofs were holding an impromptu jam session in a corner, while still another had recaptured the canvas bag and was strewing its contents around the room, shouting, "Pig pig pig pig" in a hoarse voice. The clients were on hands and knees, scrambling after their stolen property.</p>
   <p>It was a scene of utter chaos.</p>
   <p>And Tim Vanderhof wasor werehaving a glorious time. He hadn't enjoyed himself so much in years. He was doing a dozen different things, all at the same time, and the most delightful one of all dealt with the thugs, who by this time were trying only to escape from the veritable army that was assailing them.</p>
   <p>Someone cried, "The police!"</p>
   <p>That brought Vanderhof bade to sanity. He hurriedly knocked out the thugsnot a difficult task, since they were already nearly smothered by sheer weight of numbersand then fled in a body, leaving confusion in his wake.</p>
   <p>When the police arrived, they found six unconscious gangsters and a horde of socialites on hands and knees, squabbling over the division of their property. Walker was counting his fingers, with a vague air of skeptical disbelief. And there was no sign of a Vanderhof.</p>
   <p>Indeed, there was only one Vanderhof by that time. The process of assimilation had again taken place, and the resultant single Vanderhof had removed Model Twelvenow torn into shredsand resumed his own clothing. He didn't wait for events to happen, though. He took them into his own hands.</p>
   <p>The elevator lifted him fifteen stories above Fifth Avenue, letting him out at the private office of Enoch Throckmorton, the actual owner of The Svelte Shop, as well as a number of other enterprises. Vanderhof had never seen Throckmorton; there were vague rumors of his existence on some Olympian height. Walker sometimes visited the man, and even dined with him on occasion. Now, leaving the elevator, Vanderhof thought of Walker, and visualized the man, blue-black hair, flashing eyes, and apish face.</p>
   <p>"Good afternoon, Mr. Walker," said the receptionist. "Go right in."</p>
   <p>Vanderhof nodded and opened a door, facing a glass-brick desk about a mile long. Behind it sat a shriveled little fellow who was chewing a cigar.</p>
   <p>This was Enoch Throckmorton.</p>
   <p>Or, better yet: This wasEnoch Throckmorton!</p>
   <p>"Ha," said Throckmorton in a cracked voice, "sit down, Walker. I've just been getting a telephone call from downstairs. Quite a little fuss, eh?"</p>
   <p>"Nothing much," Vanderhof shrugged, grinning to himself. Apparently his resemblance to Walker was so complete that even Throckmorton was deceived.</p>
   <p>"Nothing much! Indeed! This man Vanderhof deserves recognition! He captured those bandits himselfwe'd have had to make good on every cent stolen if he hadn't. I still don't know how he did it, buthe did it. That's the important thing."</p>
   <p>"Well," Vanderhof said, "I've been intending to talk to you about Vanderhof for some time. He's the smartest man we have. Candidly, I think he deserves promotion."</p>
   <p>"Very well. What have you in mind?"</p>
   <p>"Manager. At a corresponding salary."</p>
   <p>Throckmorton said slowly, "You know, of course, that the manager of The Svelte Shop is responsible only to me. You will have no authority over Vanderhof if"</p>
   <p>"I know my limitations," Vanderhof shrugged. "Vanderhof needs no discipline."</p>
   <p>"Very well," said Throckmorton, pressing a button. 'Til attend to it immediately."</p>
   <p>"Uh" Vanderhof stood up. "By the wayif I should change my mind"</p>
   <p>Steel glinted in Throckmorton's beady eyes. "Indeed! You should have thought of that before. Do you, or do you not, recommend Vanderhof's promotion."</p>
   <p>"I do."</p>
   <p>"Then he's promoted. And the matter is now out of your handsentirely!"</p>
   <p>Vanderhof smiled and turned. He walked out on clouds. He did not even know that the elevator was taking him downstairs. Nuts to Walker....</p>
   <p>So engrossed was he in day-dreams that he forgot to resume his normal appearance by the time he reached the general officeswhich was, save for one person, deserted. This person wore tweeds, and now turned a round, crimson face and a bristling mustache on Vanderhof. It was Colonel Quester.</p>
   <p>"Hah!" the colonel bellowed gently. "There you are! I see you've kept me waiting again."</p>
   <p>"Uh"</p>
   <p>"Silence!" said Colonel Quester, and the ceiling shook. "I have come for Model Forty-three. Mrs. Quester's still furious, but the gown will placate her, I am sure. Is it ready? It had better be."</p>
   <p>"Yes," said Vanderhof faintly. "II'll get it."</p>
   <p>He fled. He got Model Forty-three. And, looking into a nearby mirror, he saw that he still exactly resembled S. Horton Walker.</p>
   <p>Carrying the gown over his arm, on the way back he met one of the models. "Why, there you are, Mr. Walker," the girl said. "I thought you were in your office."</p>
   <p>"Iuhjust stepped out for a minute."</p>
   <p>So Walker was in his office! Vanderhof started to grin. He was beaming like a Cheshire cat when he entered the room where Colonel Quester waited, rumbling faintly like a miniature Vesuvius.</p>
   <p>But the colonel softened at sight of the dress. "Ha!" he remarked. "A beauty! It is exclusive, you say?"</p>
   <p>Vanderhof stepped back a pace. "The only one in existence," he remarked. "How do you like it, bottle-nose?"</p>
   <p>There was a dead silence. Colonel Quester breathed through his nose. At last he asked, in a quiet voice, "What did you say?"</p>
   <p>"Bottle-nose was the term," said Vanderhof happily. "Also, now that I think of it, you rather resemble a wart-hog."</p>
   <p>"Brrrmph!" Quester rumbled warningly.</p>
   <p>"Brrrmph to you," said Vanderhof. "You rhinocerous. So you want Model Forty-three, do you, fathead? Well, look."</p>
   <p>He held up Model Forty-three, and with a strong tug ripped the dress from top to bottom.</p>
   <p>Quester turned magenta.</p>
   <p>Vanderhof ripped the dress again.</p>
   <p>Quester turned blue.</p>
   <p>Vanderhof finished the job by ripping Model Forty-three into ribbons and throwing it into the colonel's face. Then he waited.</p>
   <p>Colonel Quester was having difficulty in breathing. His mighty fists were clenched. "Wait," he promised. "Just wait till I control my blood-pressure. I'll break you for this"</p>
   <p>He took a step forward, and simultaneously Vanderhof dived for the inner office. He slipped through the door, held it shut behind him, and saw before him the blue-black thatch of S. Horton Walker, who was looking down at some papers on his desk.</p>
   <p>Vanderhof asserted his will-power. Instantly he changed his shape.</p>
   <p>Walker looked up. "Vanderhof?" he snapped. "I want to talk to you"</p>
   <p>"Just a minute. You have a caller."</p>
   <p>"Wait!"</p>
   <p>Vanderhof didn't wait. He stepped out of the office, carefully closing the door, and turned to confront Colonel Quester.</p>
   <p>"Ah," he said. "What can I do for you, Colonel?"</p>
   <p>"Get out of my way," said Quester, in a low, impassioned voice.</p>
   <p>"With pleasure," Vanderhof smiled, stepping aside. "If you're looking for Mr. Walker, he's right inside."</p>
   <p>To this the colonel made no answer. He entered the inner office, and Vanderhof gently shut the door after him. There was a brief silence.</p>
   <p>It was broken by a dull thud, and a short, sharp cry, mingled with a bellow of triumph. Other noises followed.</p>
   <p>"Model Forty-three, hey?" a hoarse voice boomed. "By Gad, sir, you'll eat it!"</p>
   <p>"Ah?" Vanderhof murmured, walking away. "That lace collar should make a tasty mouthful."</p>
   <p>He dusted his hands delicately. He was thinking that he had managed to acquire a personality of his own, and that his weird power of metamorphosis would gradually fade and vanish of its own accord. He was no longer a jellyfisha chameleon.</p>
   <p>He was the manager of The Svelte Shop. A choked gurgle of stark anguish came faintly from the distance.</p>
   <p>Tim Vanderhof lifted his eyebrows. "Heigh-ho," he observed. "It's five o'clock. Another day."</p>

    <p>I, THE VAMPIRE</p>
   </title>
   <section>
    <title>
     <p>1. Chevalier Futaine</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>The party was dull. I had come too early. There was a preview that night at Graumans Chinese, and few of the important guests would arrive until it was over. Jack Hardy, ace director at Summit Pictures, where I worked as assistant director, hadn't arrivedyetand he was the host. But Hardy had never been noted for punctuality.</p>
    <p>I went out on the porch and leaned against a coctail and looking down at the lights of Hollywood. Hardys place was on the summit of a hill overlooking the film capital, near Falcon Lair, Valentinos famous turreted castle. I shivered a little. Fog was sweeping in from Santa Monica, blotting out the lights to the west.</p>
    <p>Jean Hubbard, who was an ingenue at Summit, came up beside me and took the glass out of my hand.</p>
    <p>"Hello, Mart," she said, sipping the liquor. "Where've you been?"</p>
    <p>"Down with the Murder Desert troupe, on location in the Mojave," I said. "Miss me, honey?" I drew her close.</p>
    <p>She smiled up at me, her tilted eyebrows lending a touch of diablerie to the tanned, lovely face. I was going to marry Jean, but I wasn't sure just when.</p>
    <p>"Missed you lots," she said, and held up her lips. I responded.</p>
    <p>After a moment I said, "Whats this about the vampire man?"</p>
    <p>She chuckled. "Oh, the Chevalier Futaine. Didn't you read Lolly Parsons, write-up in Script? Jack Hardy picked him up last month in Europe. Silly rot. Bill its good publicity."</p>
    <p>"Three cheers for publicity," I said. "Look what it did for Birth of a Nation. But where does the vampire angle come in?"</p>
    <p>"Mystery man. Nobody can take a picture of him, scarcely anybody can meet him. Weird tales are told about his former life in Paris. Going to play in Jack , Red Thirst. The kind of build-up Universal gave Karloff for Frankenstein. Our Chevalier Futaine" she rolled out the words with amused relish"is probably a singing waiter from a Paris cafe. I havent seen himbut the deuce with him, anyway. Mart, I want you to do something for me. For Deming."</p>
    <p>"Hess Deming?" I raised my eyebrows in astonishment. Hess Deming, Summits biggest box-office star, whose wife, Sandra Colter, had died two day before. She, too, had been an actress, although never the great star her husband was. Hess loved her, I knewand now I guessed what the trouble was. I said, "I noticed he was a bit wobbly."</p>
    <p>"Hell kill himself," Jean said, looking worried. "II feel responsible for him somehow, Mart. After all, he gave me my start at Summit. And hes due for the DTs any time now."</p>
    <p>"Well, Ill do what I can," I told her. "But that isn't a great deal. After all, getting tight is probably the best thing he could do. I know if I lost you, Jean"</p>
    <p>I stopped. I didn't like to think of it.</p>
    <p>Jean nodded. "See what you can do for him, anyway. Losing Sandra that way waspretty terrible."</p>
    <p>"What way?" I asked. "I've been away, remember. I read something about it, but"</p>
    <p>"She just died," Jean said. "Pernicious anemia, they said. But Hess told me the doctor really didn't know what it was. She just seemed to grow weaker and weaker untilshe passed away."</p>
    <p>I nodded, gave Jean a hasty kiss, and went back into the house. I had just seen Hess Deming walk past, a glass in his hand. He turned as I tapped his shoulder.</p>
    <p>"Oh, Mart," he said, his voice just a bit fuzzy. He could hold his liquor, but I could tell by his bloodshot eyes that he was almost at the end of his rope. He was a handsome devil, all right, well-built, strong-featured, with level gray eyes and a broad mouth that was usually smiling. It wasn't smiling now. It was slack, and his face was bedewed with perspiration.</p>
    <p>"You know about Sandra?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"Yeah," I said. "Im sorry, Hess."</p>
    <p>He drank deeply from the glass, wiped his mouth with a grimace of distaste. "I'm drunk, Mart," he confided. "I had to get drunk. It was awfulthose last few days. I've got to burn her up."</p>
    <p>I didn't say anything.</p>
    <p>"Burn her up. Oh, my God, Martthat beautiful body of hers, crumbling to  In i -and I've got to watch it! She made me promise Id watch to make sure they burned her."</p>
    <p>I said, "Cremations a clean ending, Hess. And Sandra was a clean girl, and a damned good actress."</p>
    <p>He put his flushed face close to mine. "Yeahbut I've got to burn her up. Itll kill me, Mart. Oh, God!" He put the empty glass down on a table and looked around dazedly.</p>
    <p>I was wondering why Sandra had insisted on cremation. Shed given an interview once in which she stressed her dread of fire. Most write-ups of stars are applesauce, but I happened to know that Sandra did dread fire. Once, on the set, Id seen her go into hysterics when her leading man lit his pipe too near her face.</p>
    <p>"Excuse me, Mart," Hess said. "I've got to get another drink."</p>
    <p>"Wait a minute," I said, holding him. "You want to watch yourself, Hess, you've had too much already."</p>
    <p>"It still hurts," he said. "Just a little more and maybe it wont hurt so much." But he didn't pull away. Instead he stared at me with the dullness of intoxication in his eyes. "Clean," he said presently.</p>
    <p>"She said that too. Mart. She said burning was a clean death. But, God, that beautiful white body of hersI cant stand it, Mart! Im going crazy, I think. Get me a drink, like a good fellow."</p>
    <p>I said, "Wait here, Hess. Ill get you one." I didn't add that it would be wateredconsiderably.</p>
    <p>He sank down in a chair, mumbling thanks. As I went off I felt sick. Id seen too many actors going on the rocks to mistake Hesss symptoms. I knew that his box office days were over. There would be longer and longer waits between features, and then personal appearances, and finally Poverty Row and serials. And in the end maybe a man found dead in a cheap hall bedroom on Main Street, with the gas on.</p>
    <p>There was a crowd around the bar. Somebody said, "Heres Mart. Hey, come on and meet the vampire."</p>
    <p>Then I got a shock. I saw Jack Hardy, my host, the director with whom I'd on many a hit. He looked like a corpse. And I'd seen him looking plenty Ixitl before. A man with a hangover or a marijuana jag isn't a pretty sight, but I'd never seen Hardy like this. He looked as though he was keeping going on his nerve alone. There was no blood in the man.</p>
    <p>Id last seen him as a stocky, ruddy blond, who looked like nothing so much as a wrestler, with his huge biceps, his ugly, good-natured face, and his bristling crop of yellow hair. Now he looked like a skeleton, with skin hanging loosely on the big frame. His face was a network of sagging wrinkles. Pouches bagged beneath his eyes, and those eyes were dull and glazed. About his neck a black silk scarf was knotted tightly.</p>
    <p>"Good God, Jack!" I exclaimed. "What have you done to yourself?"</p>
    <p>He looked away quickly. "Nothing," he said brusquely. "Im all right. I want you to meet the Chevalier Futaine, this is Mart Prescott."</p>
    <p>"Pierre," a voice said. "Hollywood is no place for titles. Mart Prescottthe pleasure is mine."</p>
    <p>I faced the Chevalier Pierre Futaine.</p>
    <p>We shook hands. My first impression was of icy cold, and a slick kind of drynessand I let go of his hand too quickly to be polite. He smiled at me.</p>
    <p>A charming man, the chevalier. Or so he seemed. Slender, below medium height, his bland, round face seemed incongruously youthful. Blond hair was plastered close to his scalp. I saw that his cheeks were rougedvery deftly, but I know something about makeup. And under the rouge I read a curious, deathly pallor that would have made him a marked man had he not disguised it. Some disease, perhaps, had blanched his skinbut his lips were not artificially reddened. And they were as crimson as blood.</p>
    <p>He was clean-shaved, wore impeccable evening clothes, and his eyes were black pools of ink.</p>
    <p>"Glad to know you," I said. "Youre the vampire, eh?"</p>
    <p>He smiled. "So they tell me. But we all serve the dark god of publicity, eh Mr. Prescott? Oris it Mart?"</p>
    <p>"Its Mart," I said, still staring at him. I saw his eyes go past me, and an extraordinary expression appeared on his facean expression of amazement, disbelief. Swiftly it was gone.</p>
    <p>I turned. Jean was approaching, was at my side as I moved. She said, "Is this the chevalier?"</p>
    <p>Pierre Futaine was staring at her, his lips parted a little. Almost inaudibly he murmured, "Sonya." And then, on a note of interrogation, "Sonya?"</p>
    <p>I introduced the two. Jean said, "You see, my name isnt Sonya."</p>
    <p>The chevalier shook his head, an odd look in his black eyes.</p>
    <p>"I once knew a girl like you," he said softly. "Very much like you. Its strange."</p>
    <p>"Will you excuse me?" I broke in. Jack Hardy was leaving the bar. Quickly I followed him.</p>
    <p>I touched his shoulder as he went out the French windows. He jerked out a snarled oath, turned a white death mask of a face to me.</p>
    <p>"Damn you, Mart," he snarled. "Keep your hands to yourself."</p>
    <p>I put my hands on his shoulders and swung him around.</p>
    <p>"What the devil has happened to you?" I asked. "Listen, Jack, you cant bluff me or lie to me. You know that. I've straightened you out enough times in the past, and I can do it again. Let me in on it."</p>
    <p>His ruined face softened. He reached up and took away my hands. His own were ice-cold, like the hands of the Chevalier Futaine.</p>
    <p>"No," he said. "No use, Mart. Theres nothing you can do. Im all right, really. Just overstrain. I had too good a time in Paris."</p>
    <p>I was up against a blank wall. Suddenly, without volition, a thought popped into my mind and out of my mouth before I knew it.</p>
    <p>"Whats the matter with your neck?" I asked abruptly.</p>
    <p>He didn't answer. He just frowned and shook his head.</p>
    <p>"I've a throat infection," he told me. "Caught it on the steamer."</p>
    <p>His hand went up and touched the black scarf.</p>
    <p>There was a croaking, harsh sound from behind usa sound that didn't seem quite human. I turned. It was Hess Deming. He was swaying in the portal, his eyes glaring and bloodshot, a little trickle of saliva running down his chin.</p>
    <p>He said in a dead, expressionless voice that was somehow dreadful, "Sandra died of a throat infection, Hardy."</p>
    <p>Jack didn't answer. He stumbled back a step. Hess went on dully.</p>
    <p>"She got all white and died. And the doctor didn't know what it was, although the death certificate said anemia. Did you bring back some filthy disease with you, Hardy? Because if you did Im going to kill you."</p>
    <p>"Wait a minute," I said. "A throat infection? I didn't know"</p>
    <p>"There was a wound on her throattwo little marks, close together. That wouldn't have killed her, unless some loathsome disease"</p>
    <p>"Youre crazy, Hess," I said. "You know you're drunk. Listen to me: Jack couldn't have had anything to do with that."</p>
    <p>Hess didn't look at me. He watched Jack Hardy out of his bloodshot eyes. He went on in that low, deadly monotone:</p>
    <p>"Will you swear Marts right, Hardy? Will you?"</p>
    <p>Jacks lips were twisted by some inner agony. I said, "Go on, Jack. Tell him hes wrong."</p>
    <p>Hardy burst out, "I haven't been near your wife! I havent seen her since I got back. Theres"</p>
    <p>"Thats not the answer I want," Hess whispered. And he sprang for the other IIMII reeled forward, rather.</p>
    <p>Hess was too drunk, and Jack too weak, for them to do each other any harm, but there was a nasty scuffle for a moment before I separated them. As I pulled them apart, Hesss hand clutched the scarf about Jacks neck, ripped it away.</p>
    <p>And I saw the marks on Jack Hardys throat. Two red, angry little pits, white rimmed, just over the Iclt jugular.</p>

     <p>2. The Cremation of Sandra</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>It was the next day that Jean telephoned me.</p>
    <p>"Mart," she said, "were going to run over a scene for Red Thirst tonight at the studioStage 6. You've been assigned as assistant director for the pic, so you should be there. AndI had an idea Jack might not tell you. Hes beenso odd lately."</p>
    <p>"Thanks, honey," I said. "Ill be there. But I didn't know you were in the flicker."</p>
    <p>"Neither did I, but theres been some wire-pulling. Somebody wanted me in itthe chevalier, I thinkand the big boss phoned me this morning and let me in on the secret. I don't feel up to it, though. Had a bad night."</p>
    <p>"Sorry," I sympathized. "You were okay when I left you."</p>
    <p>"I had anightmare," she said slowly. "It was rather frightful, Mart. Its funny, though, I cant remember what it was about. Wellyoull be there tonight?"</p>
    <p>I said I would, but as it happened I was unable to keep my promise. Hess Deming telephoned me, asking if Id come out to his Malibu place and drive him into town. He was too shaky to handle a car himself, he said, and Sandras cremation was to take place that afternoon. I got out my roadster and sent it spinning west on Sunset. In twenty minutes I was at Deming's beach house The houseboy let me in, shaking his head gravely as he recognized me. "Mist Doming pretty bad," he told me. "All morning drinking gin straight"</p>
    <p>From upstairs Hess shouted, "That you, Mart? Okay. I'll be down right away. Come up here, Jim!"</p>
    <p>The Japanese, with a meaningful glance at me, pattered upstairs.</p>
    <p>I wandered over to a table, examining the magazines upon it. A little breeze of wind came through the half-open window, fluttering a scrap of paper. A word on it caught my eye, and I picked up the note. For thats what it was. It was addressed to Hess, and after one glance I had no compunction about scanning it. "Hess dear," the message read. "I feel Im going to die very soon. And I want you to do something for me. I've been out of my head, I know, saying things I didn't mean. Dont cremate me, Hess. Even though I were dead Id feel the fireI know it. Bury me in a vault in Forest Lawnand dont embalm me. I shall be dead when you find this, but I know youll do as I wish, dear. And alive or dead, I'll always love you."</p>
    <p>The note was signed by Sandra Colter, Hesss wife. This was (Kid. I wondered whether Hess had seen it yet.</p>
    <p>There was a little hiss of indrawn breath from behind me. It was Jim, the houseboy. He said, "Mist Prescott, I find that note last night. Mist Hess not seen it. It Mis Colters writing."</p>
    <p>He hesitated, and I read fear in his eyessheer, unashamed fear. He put a brown forefinger on the note.</p>
    <p>"See that, Mist Prescott?"</p>
    <p>He was pointing to a smudge of ink that half obscured the signature. I said, "Well?"</p>
    <p>"I do that, Mist Prescott. When I pick up the note. The inknot dry."</p>
    <p>I stared at him. He turned hastily at the sound of footsteps on the stairs. Hess Deming was coming down, rather shakily.</p>
    <p>I think it was then that I first realized the horrible truth. I didn't believe it, thoughnot then. It was too fantastic, too incredible; yet something of the truth must have crept into my mind, for there was no other explanation for what I did then.</p>
    <p>Hess said, "What have you got there, Mart?"</p>
    <p>"Nothing," I said quietly. I crumpled the note and thrust it into my pocket. "Nothing important, anyway. Ready to go?"</p>
    <p>He nodded, and we went to the door. I caught a glimpse of Jim staring after us, an expression ofwas it relief?in his dark, wizened face.</p>
    <p>The crematory was in Pasadena, and I left Hess there. I would have stayed with him, but he wouldn't have it. I knew he didn't want anyone to be watching him when Sandras body was being incinerated. And I knew it would be easier for him that way. I took a short cut through the Hollywood hills, and thats where the trouble started.</p>
    <p>I broke an axle. Recent rains had gullied the road, and I barely saved the car from turning over. After that I had to hike miles to the nearest telephone, and then I wasted more time waiting for a taxi to pick me up. It was nearly eight oclock when I arrived at the studio.</p>
    <p>The gateman let me in, and I hurried to Stage 6. It was dark. Cursing under my breath, I turned away, and almost collided with a small figure. It was Forrest, one of the cameramen. He let out a curious squeal, and clutched my arm.</p>
    <p>"That you, Mart? Listen, will you do me a favor? I want you to watch a I uint"</p>
    <p>"Havent time," I said. "Seen Jean around here? I was to"</p>
    <p>"Its about that," Forrest said. He was a shriveled, monkey-faced little chap, but a mighty good cameraman. "They've goneJean and Hardy and the chevalier. Theres something funny about that guy."</p>
    <p>"Think so? Well, I'll phone Jean. Ill look at your rushes tomorrow."</p>
    <p>"She wont be home," he told me. "The chevalier took her over to the 1 uovc Listen, Mart, you've got to watch this. Either I dont know how to handle i runder any more, or that Frenchman is the damnedest thing I've ever shot, come over to the theater. Mart I've got the reel ready to run. Just developed the rough print myself."</p>
    <p>"Oh, all right," I assented, and followed Forrest to the theater.</p>
    <p>I found a seat in the dark little auditorium, and listened to Forrest moving about in the projection booth. He clicked on the amplifier and said: "Hardy didn't warn any pictures takeninsisted on it, you know. But the boss told me to leave one of the automatic cameras goingnot to bother with the soundjust to get an idea how the French guy would screen. Lucky it wasn't one of the old rattler cameras, or Hardy would have caught on. Here it comes, Mart!"</p>
    <p>I heard a click as the amplifier was switched off. White light flared on the screen. It faded, gave place to a picturethe interior of Stage 6. The set was incongruousa mid-Victorian parlor, with overstuffed plush chairs, gilt-edged paintings, even a particularly hideous what-not. Jack Hardy moved into the range of the camera. On the screen his face seemed to leap out at me like a deaths-head, covered with sagging, wrinkled skin. Following him came Jean, wearing a tailored suitno one dresses for rehearsalsand behind her</p>
    <p>I blinked, thinking that my eyes were tricking me. Something like a glowing fogoval, tall as a manwas moving across the screen. You've seen the nimbus of light on the screen when a flashlight is turned directly on the camera? Wellit was like that, except that its source was not traceable. And, horribly, it moved forward at about the pace a man would walk.</p>
    <p>The amplifier clicked again. Forrest said, "When I saw it on the negative I thought I was screwy, Mart. I saw the takethere wasn't any funny light there"</p>
    <p>The oval, glowing haze was motionless beside Jean, and she was looking directly at it, a smile on her lips. "Mart, when that was taken, Jean was looking right at the French guy!"</p>
    <p>I said, somewhat hoarsely, "Hold it, Forrest. Right there."</p>
    <p>The images slowed down, became motionless. Jeans profile was toward the camera. I leaned forward, staring at something I had glimpsed on the girls neck. It was scarcely visible save as a tiny, discolored mark on Jean's throat, above the jugularbut unmistakably the same wound I had seen on the throat of Jack Hardy the night before!</p>
    <p>I heard the amplifier click off. Suddenly the screen showed blindingly white, and then went black.</p>
    <p>I waited a moment, but there was no sound from the booth.</p>
    <p>"Forrest," I called. "You okay?"</p>
    <p>There was no sound. The faint whirring of the projector had died. I got up quickly and went to the back of the theater. There were two entrances to the booth, a door which opened on stairs leading down to the alley outside, and a hole in the floor reached by means of a metal ladder. I went up this swiftly, an ominous apprehension mounting within me.</p>
    <p>Forrest was still there. But he was no longer alive. He lay sprawled on his back, his wizened face staring up blindly, his head twisted at an impossible angle. It was quite apparent that his neck had been broken almost instantly.</p>
    <p>I sent a hasty glance at the projector. The can of film was gone! And the door opening on the stairway was ajar a few inches.</p>
    <p>I stepped out on the stairs, although I knew I would see no one. The white-lit broad alley between Stages 6 and 4 was silent and empty.</p>
    <p>The sound of running feet came to me, steadily growing louder. A man came racing into view. I recognized him as one of the publicity gang. I hailed him.</p>
    <p>"Cant wait," he gasped, but slowed down nevertheless.</p>
    <p>I said, "Have you seen anyone around here just now? The Chevalier Futaine?"</p>
    <p>He shook his head. "No, but" His face was white as he looked up at me. "Hess Demings gone crazy. I've got to contact the papers."</p>
    <p>Ice gripped me. I raced down the stairs, clutched his arm.</p>
    <p>"What do you mean?" I snapped. "Hess was all right when I left him. A bit tight, thats all."</p>
    <p>His face was glistening with sweat. "Its awfulIm not sure yet what happened. His wifeSandra Coltercame to life while they were cremating her. They saw her through the window, you knowscreaming and pounding at the glass while she was being burned alive. Hess got her out too late. He went stark, raving mad. Suspended animation, they say I've got to get to a phone, Mr. Prescott!"</p>
    <p>He tore himself away, sprinted in the direction of the administration buildings.</p>
    <p>I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out a scrap of paper. It was the note I had found in Hess Demings house. The words danced and wavered before my eyes. Over and over I was telling myself, "It cant be true! Such things cant happen!"</p>
    <p>I didn't mean Sandra Colters terrible resurrection during the cremation. That, alone, might be plausibly explainedcatalepsy, perhaps. But taken in conjunction with certain other occurrences, it led to one definite conclusionand it was a conclusion I dared not face.</p>
    <p>What had poor Forrest said? That the chevalier was taking Jean to the Cocoanut Grove? Well</p>
    <p>The taxi was still waiting. I got in.</p>
    <p>"The Ambassador," I told the driver grimly. "Twenty bucks if you hit the green lights all the way."</p>

     <p>3. The Black Coffin</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>All night I had been combing Hollywoodwithout success. Neither the Chevalier Futaine nor Jean had been to the Grove, I discovered. And no one knew the Chevaliers address. A telephone call to the studio, now ablaze with the excitement over the Hess Deming disaster and the Forrest killing, netted me exactly nothing. I went the rounds of Hollywood night life vainly. The Trocadero, Sardis, all three of the Brown Derbies, the smart, notorious clubs of the Sunset eightiesnowhere could I find my quarry. I telephoned Jack Hardy a dozen times, but got no answer. Finally, in a "private club" in Culver City, I met with my first stroke of good luck.</p>
    <p>"Mr. Hardys upstairs," the proprietor told me, looking anxious. "Nothin wrong, I hope, Mr. Prescott? I heard about Deming."</p>
    <p>"Nothing," I said. "Take me up to him."</p>
    <p>"Hes sleeping it off," the man admitted. "Tried to drink the place dry, and I put him upstairs where hed be safe."</p>
    <p>"Not the first time, eh?" I said, with an assumption of lightness. "Well, bring up some coffee, will you? Black. I've got totalk to him."</p>
    <p>But it was half an hour before Hardy was in any shape to understand what I was saying. At last he sat up on the couch, blinking, and a gleam of realization came into his sunken eyes.</p>
    <p>"Prescott," he said, "cant you leave me alone?"</p>
    <p>I leaned close to him, articulating carefully so he would be sure to understand me. "I know what the Chevalier Futaine is," I said.</p>
    <p>And I waited for the dreadful, impossible confirmation, or for the words which would convince me that I was an insane fool.</p>
    <p>Hardy looked at me dully. "How did you find out?" he whispered.</p>
    <p>An icy shock went through me. Up to that moment I had not really believed, in spite of all the evidence. But now Hardy was confirming the suspicions which I had not let myself believe.</p>
    <p>I didn't answer his question. Instead, I said, "Do you know about Hess?" He nodded, and at sight of the agony in his face I almost pitied him. Then the thought of Jean steadied me.</p>
    <p>"Do you know where he is now?" I asked.</p>
    <p>"No. What are you talking about?" he flared suddenly. "Are you mad, Mart? Do you"</p>
    <p>"Im not mad. But Hess Deming is."</p>
    <p>He looked at me like a cowering, whipped dog.</p>
    <p>I went on grimly: "Are you going to tell me the truth? How you got those marks on your throat? How you met thiscreature? And where hes taken Jean?"</p>
    <p>"Jean!" He looked genuinely startled. "Has he gotI didn't know that, Mart, I swear I didn't. You, you've been a good friend to me, andand I'll tell you the truth for your sake and Jeansalthough now it may be too late." My involuntary movement made him glance at me quickly. Then he went on. "I met him in Paris. I was out after new sensationsbut I didnt expect anything like that. A Satanist club devil-worshippers, they were. The ordinary stuffcheap, furtive blasphemy. But it was there that I methim.</p>
    <p>"He can be a fascinating chap when he tries. He drew me out, made me tell him about Hollywoodabout the women we have here. I bragged a little. He asked me about the stars, whether they were really as beautiful as they seemed. His eyes were hungry as he listened to me, Mart.</p>
    <p>"Then one night I had a fearful nightmare. A monstrous, black horror crept in through the window and attacked mebit me in the throat, I dreamed, or thought I did. After that I was in his power. He told me the truth. He made me his slave, and I could do nothing. His powers are not human."</p>
    <p>I licked dry lips.</p>
    <p>Hardy continued: "He made me bring him here, introducing him as a new discovery to be starred in Red ThirstId mentioned the picture to him, before Iknew. How he must have laughed at me! He made me serve him, keeping away photographers, making sure that there were no cameras, no mirrors near him. And for a rewardhe let me live."</p>
    <p>I knew I should feel contempt for Hardy, panderer to such a loathsome evil. But somehow I couldn't.</p>
    <p>I said quietly, "What about Jean? Where does the chevalier live?"</p>
    <p>He told me. "But you cant do anything, Mart. Theres a vault under the house, where he stays during the day. It cant be opened, except with a key he always keeps with hima silver key. He had a door specially made, and then did something to it so that nothing can open it but that key. Even dynamite wouldn't do it, he told me."</p>
    <p>I said, "Such things can be killed."</p>
    <p>"Not easily. Sandra Colter was a victim of his. After death she, too, became a vampire, sleeping by day and living only at night. The fire destroyed her, but theres no way to get into the vault under Futaines house."</p>
    <p>"I wasn't thinking of fire," I said. "A knife"</p>
    <p>"Through the heart," Hardy interrupted almost eagerly. "Yes, and decapitation. I've thought of it myself, but I can do nothing. I am his slave, Mart."</p>
    <p>I said nothing, but pressed the bell. Presently the proprietor appeared.</p>
    <p>"Can you get me a butcher knife?" I measured with my hands. "About so long? A sharp one?"</p>
    <p>Accustomed to strange requests, he nodded. "Right away, Mr. Prescott." As I followed him out, Hardy said weakly, "Mart."</p>
    <p>I turned.</p>
    <p>"Good luck," he said. The look on his wrecked face robbed the words of their pathos.</p>
    <p>"Thanks," I forced myself to say. "I dont blame you, Jack, for whats happened. I'd have done the same."</p>
    <p>I left him there, slumped on the couch, staring after me with eyes that had looked into hell.</p>
    <p>It was past daylight when I drove out of Culver City, a long, razor-edged knife hidden securely inside my coat. And the day went past all too quickly. A telephone call told me that Jean had not yet returned home. It took me more than an hour to locate a certain man I wanteda man who had worked for the studio before on certain delicate jobs. There was little about locks he did not know, as the Police had sometimes ruefully admitted.</p>
    <p>His name was Axel Ferguson, a bulky, good-natured Swede, whose thick fingers seemed more adapted to handling a shovel than the mechanisms of locks. Yet he was as expert as Houdiniindeed, he had at one time been a professional magician.</p>
    <p>The front door of Futaines isolated canyon home proved no bar to Fergusons fingers and the tiny sliver of steel he used. The house, a modern two-story place, seemed deserted. But Hardy had said below the house.</p>
    <p>We went down the cellar stairs and found ourselves in a concrete-lined passage that ran down at a slight angle for perhaps thirty feet. There the corridor ended in what seemed to be a blank wall of bluish steel. The glossy surface of the door was unbroken, save for a single keyhole.</p>
    <p>Ferguson set to work. At first he hummed under his breath, but after a time he worked in silence. Sweat began to glisten on his face. Trepidation assailed me as I watched.</p>
    <p>The flashlight he had placed beside him grew dim. He inserted another battery, got out unfamiliar-looking apparatus. He buckled on dark goggles, and handed me a pair. A blue, intensely brilliant flame began to play on the door. It was useless. The torch was discarded after a time, and Ferguson returned to his tools. He was using a stethoscope, taking infinite pains in the delicate movements of his hands.</p>
    <p>It was fascinating to watch him. But all the time I realized that the night was coming, that presently the sun would go down, and that the life of the vampire lasts from sunset to sunrise.</p>
    <p>At last Ferguson gave up. "I cant do it," he told me, panting as though from a hard race. "And if I cant, nobody can. Even Houdini couldn't have broken this lock. The only thing thatll open it is the key."</p>
    <p>"All right, Axel," I said dully. "Heres your money."</p>
    <p>He hesitated, watching me. "You going to stay here. Mr. Prescott?"</p>
    <p>"Yeah," I said. "You can find your way out. I'llwait awhile."</p>
    <p>"Well, I'll leave the light with you," he said. "You can let me have it sometime, eh?"</p>
    <p>He waited, and, as I made no answer, he departed, shaking his head.</p>
    <p>Then utter silence closed around me. I took the knife out of my coat, tested its edge against my thumb, and settled back to wait.</p>
    <p>Less than half an hour later the steel door began to swing open. I stood up. Through the widening crack I saw a bare, steel-lined chamber, empty save for a long, black object that rested on the floor. It was a coffin.</p>
    <p>The door was wide. Into view moved a white, slender figureJean, clad in a diaphanous, silken robe. Her eyes were wide, fixed and staring. She looked like a sleepwalker.</p>
    <p>A man followed hera man wearing impeccable evening clothes. Not a hair was out of place on his sleek blond head, and he was touching his lips delicately with a handkerchief as he came out of the vault.</p>
    <p>There was a little crimson stain on the white linen where his lips had brushed.</p>

     <p>4. I, the Vampire</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Jean walked past me as though I didn't exist. But the Chevalier Futaine paused, his eyebrows lifted. His black eyes pierced through me.</p>
    <p>The handle of the knife was hot in my hand. I moved aside to block Futaine's way. Behind me came a rustle of silk, and from the corner of my eye I saw Jean pause hesitatingly.</p>
    <p>The chevalier eyed me, toying negligently with his handkerchief. "Mart," he said slowly. "Mart Prescott." His eyes flickered toward the knife, and a little smile touched his lips.</p>
    <p>I said, "You know why Im here, don't you?"</p>
    <p>"Yes," he said. "Iheard you. I was not disturbed. Only one thing can open this door."</p>
    <p>From his pocket he drew a key, shining with a dull silver sheen.</p>
    <p>"Only this," he finished, replacing it. "Your knife is useless, Mart Prescott."</p>
    <p>"Maybe," I said, edging forward very slightly. "What have you done to Jean?"</p>
    <p>A curious expression, almost of pain, flashed into his eyes. "She is mine," he shot out half angrily. "You can do nothing, for"</p>
    <p>I sprang then, or, at least, I tried to. The blade of the knife sheared down straight for Futaine's white shirtfront. It was arrested in midair. Yet he had not moved. His eyes had bored into mine, suddenly, terribly, and it seemed as though a wave of fearful energy had blasted out at meparalyzing me, rendering me helpless. I stood rigid. Veins throbbed in my temples as I tried to moveto bring down the knife. It was useless. I stood as immovable as a statue.</p>
    <p>The chevalier brushed past me.</p>
    <p>"Follow," he said almost casually, and like an automaton I swung about, began to move along the passage. What hellish hypnotic power was this that held me helpless?</p>
    <p>Futaine led the way upstairs. It was not yet dark, although the sun had gone down. I followed him into a room, and at his gesture dropped into a chair. At my side was a small table. The chevalier touched my arm gently, and something like a mild electric shock went through me. The knife dropped from my fingers, clattering to the table.</p>
    <p>Jean was standing rigidly nearby, her eyes dull and expressionless. Futaine moved to her side, put an arm about her waist. My mouth felt as though it were filled with mud, but somehow I managed to croak out articulate words.</p>
    <p>"Damn you, Futaine! Leave her alone!"</p>
    <p>He released her, and came toward me, his face dark with anger.</p>
    <p>"You fool, I could kill you now, very easily. I could make you go down to the busiest corner of Hollywood and slit your throat with that knife. I have the"</p>
    <p>The face of a beast looking into mine. He snarled. "She is not yours. Nor is she Jean. She is Sonya."</p>
    <p>I remembered what Futaine had murmured when he had first seen Jean. He read the question in my eyes.</p>
    <p>"I knew a girl like that once, very long ago. That was Sonya. They killed herput a stake through her heart, long ago in Thurn. Now that I've found this girl, who might be a reincarnation of Sonya, they are so alike. I shall not give her up. Nor can anyone force me."</p>
    <p>"You've made her a devil like yourself," I said through half-paralyzed lips. "I'd rather kill her"</p>
    <p>Futaine turned to watch Jean. "Not yet," he said softly. "She is mine, yes. She bears the stigmata. But she is still alive. She will not become wampyr until she has died, or until she has tasted the red milk. She shall do that tonight." I cursed him bitterly, foully. He touched my lips, and I could utter no sound. Then they left me, Jean and her master. I heard a door close quietly.</p>
    <p>The night dragged on. Futile struggles had convinced me that it was useless to attempt escapeI could not even force a whisper through my lips. More than once I felt myself on the verge of madnessthinking of Jean, and remembering Futaine's ominous words. Eventually agony brought its own surcease, and I fell into a kind of coma, lasting for how long I could not guess. Many hours had passed, I knew, before I heard footsteps coming toward my prison.</p>
    <p>Jean moved into my range of vision. I searched her face with my eyes, seeking for some mark of a dreadful metamorphosis. I could find none. Her beauty was unmarred, save for the terrible little wounds on her throat. She went to a couch and quietly lay down. Her eyes closed.</p>
    <p>The chevalier came past me and went to Jeans side. He stood looking down at her. I have mentioned before the incongruous youthfulness of his face. That was gone now. He looked oldold beyond imagination.</p>
    <p>At last he shrugged and turned to me. His fingers brushed my lips again, and I found that I could speak. Life flooded back into my veins, benign lancing twinges of pain. I moved an arm experimentally. The paralysis was leaving me. The chevalier said, "She is still clean. I could not do it."</p>
    <p>Amazement flooded me. My eyes widened in disbelief.</p>
    <p>Futaine smiled wryly. "It is quite true. I could have made her as myself undead. But at the last moment I forbade her." He looked toward the windows. "It will be dawn soon."</p>
    <p>I glanced at the knife on the table beside me. The chevalier put out a hand and drew it away.</p>
    <p>"Wait," he said. "There is something I must tell you, Mart Prescott. You say that you know who and what I am."</p>
    <p>I nodded.</p>
    <p>"Through the ages I have come, since first I fell victim to another vampire for thus is the evil spread. Deathless and not alive, bringing fear and sorrow always, knowing the bitter agony of Tantalus, I have gone down through the weary centuries. I have known Richard and Henry and Elizabeth of England, and ever have I brought terror and destruction in the night, for I am an alien thing, I am the undead."</p>
    <p>The quiet voice went on, holding me motionless in its weird spell.</p>
    <p>"I, the vampire. I, the accursed, the shining evil, negotium perambulans in tenebris . . . but I was not always thus. Long ago in Thurn, before the shadow leapt upon me, I loved a girl, Sonya. But the vampire visited me, and I sickened and died and awoke. Then I arose.</p>
    <p>"It is the curse of the undead to prey upon those they love. I visited Sonya.</p>
    <p>"I made her my own. She, too, died, and for a brief while we walked the earth together, neither alive nor dead. But that was not Sonya. It was her body, yes, but I had not loved her body alone. I realized too late that I had destroyed her utterly."</p>
    <p>"One day they opened her grave, and the priest drove a stake through her heart, and gave her rest. Me they could not find, for my coffin was hidden too well. I put love behind me then, knowing that there was none for such as I.</p>
    <p>"Hope came to me when I found Jean. Hundreds of years have passed since Sonya crumbled to dust, but I thought I had found her again. AndI took her. Nothing human could prevent me."</p>
    <p>The chevaliers eyelids sagged. He looked infinitely old.</p>
    <p>"Nothing human. Yet in the end I found that I could not condemn her to the It.'ll that is mine. I thought I had forgotten love. But, long and long ago, I loved Sonya. And, because of her, and because I know that I would only destroy, as I did once before, I shall not work my will on this girl."</p>
    <p>I turned to watch the still figure on the couch. The chevalier followed my gaze and nodded slowly.</p>
    <p>"Yes, she bears the stigmata. She will die, unless"he met my gaze unblinkingly"unless I die. If you had broken into the vault yesterday, if you had sunk that knife into my heart, she would be free now." He glanced at the windows again. "The sun will rise soon."</p>
    <p>Then he went quickly to Jeans side. He looked down at her for a moment. "She is very beautiful," he murmured. "Too beautiful for hell."</p>
    <p>The chevalier swung about, went toward the door. As he passed me he threw something carelessly on the table, something that tinkled as it fell. In the portal he paused, and a little smile twisted the scarlet lips. I remembered him thus, framed against the black background of the doorway, his sleek blond head erect and unafraid. He lifted his arm in a gesture that should have been theatrical, but, somehow, wasn't.</p>
    <p>"And so farewell. I who am about to die"</p>
    <p>He did not finish. In the faint grayness of dawn I saw him striding away, heard his footsteps on the stairs, receding and faintheard a muffled clang as of a great door closing. The paralysis had left me. I was trembling a little, for I realized what I must do soon. But I knew I would not fail.</p>
    <p>I glanced down at the table. Even before I saw what lay beside the knife, I knew what would be there. A silver key. . . .</p>

    <p>THE SHADOW ON THE SCREEN</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>A weird story of Hollywood, and the grisly horror that cast its dreadful shadow across the silver screen as an incredible motion-picture was run off</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Torture Master was being given a sneak preview at a Beverly Hills theatre. Somehow, when my credit line, "Directed by Peter Haviland," was flashed on the screen, a little chill of apprehension shook me, despite the applause that came from a receptive audience. When you've been in the picture game for a long time you get these hunches; I've often spotted a dud flicker before a hundred feet have been reeled off. Yet Torture Master was no worse than a dozen similar films I'd handled in the past few years.</p>
   <p>But it was formula, box-office formula. 1 could see that. The star was all right; the make-up department had done a good job; the dialogue was unusually smooth. Yet the film was obviously box-office, and not the sort of film I'd have liked to direct.</p>
   <p>After watching a reel unwind amid an encouraging scattering of applause, I got up and went to the lobby. Some of the gang from Summit Pictures were lounging there, smoking and commenting on the picture, Ann Howard, who played the heroine in Torture Master, noticed my scowl and pulled me into a corner. She was that rare type, a girl who will screen well without a lot of the yellow grease-paint that makes you look like an animated corpse. She was small, and her hair and eyes and skin were brownI'd like to have seen her play Peter Pan. That type, you know.</p>
   <p>I had occasionally proposed to her, but she never took me seriously. As a matter of fact, I myself didn't know how serious I was about it. Now she led me into the bar and ordered sidecars.</p>
   <p>"Don't look so miserable, Pete," she said over the rim of her glass. "The picture's going over. It'll gross enough to suit the boss, and it won't hurt my reputation."</p>
   <p>Well, that was right. Ann had a fat part, and she'd made the most of it. And the picture would be good box-office; Universal's Night Key, with Karloff, had been released a few months ago, and the audiences were ripe for another horror picture.</p>
   <p>"I know," I told her. signaling the bartender to refill my glass. "But I get tired of these damn hokumy pics. Lord, how I'd like to do another Cabinet of Doctor Caligari!"</p>
   <p>"Or another Ape of God," Ann suggested.</p>
   <p>I shrugged. "Even that, maybe. There's so much chance for development of the weird on the screen, Annand no producer will stand for a genuinely good picture of that type. They call it arty, and say it'll flop. If I branched out on my ownwell, Hecht and MacArthur tried it, and they're back on the Hollywood payroll now."</p>
   <p>Someone Ann knew came up and engaged her in conversation. I saw a man beckoning, and with a hasty apology left Ann to join him. It was Andy Worth, Hollywood's dirtiest columnist. I knew him for a double-crosser and a skunk, but I also knew that he could get more inside information than a brace of Winchells. He was a short, fat chap with a meticulously cultivated mustache and sleeky pomaded black hair. Worth fancied himself as a ladies' man, and spent a great deal of his time trying to blackmail actresses into having affairs with him.</p>
   <p>That didn't make him a villain, of course. I like anybody who can carry on an intelligent conversation for ten minutes, and Worth could do that. He fingered his mustache and said, "I heard you talking about Ape of God, A coincidence, Pete."</p>
   <p>"Yeah?" I was cautious. I had to be, with this walking scandal-sheet. "How's that?"</p>
   <p>He took a deep breath. "Well, you understand that I haven't got the real lowdown, and it's all hearsaybut I've found a picture that'll make the weirdest flicker ever canned look side"</p>
   <p>I suspected a gag. "Okay, what is it? Torture Master?"</p>
   <p>Black and white drawing of a man grappling a humanoid figure half in shadow. The left tentacle from the figure holds his right arm and another tentacle extends ho his left-hand side.</p>
   <p>"He was lifted through a welter of coiling, ropy tentacles."</p>
   <p>"Eh? Nothough Blake's yarn deserved better adaptation than your boys gave it. No, Pete, the one I'm talking about isn't for general releaseisn't completed, in fact. I saw a few rushes of it. A one-man affair; title's The Nameless. Arnold Keene's doing it."</p>
   <p>Worth sat back and watched how I took that. And I must have shown my amazement. For it was Arnold Keene who had directed the notorious Ape of God, which had wrecked his promising career in films. The public doesn't know that picture. It never was released. Summit junked it. And they had good cause, although it was one of the most amazingly effective weird films I've ever seen. Keene had shot most of it down in Mexico, and he'd been able to assume virtual dictatorship of the location troupe. Several Mexicans had died at the time, and there had been some ugly rumors, but it had all been hushed up. I'd talked with several people who had been down near Taxco with Keene, and they spoke of the man with peculiar horror. He had been willing to sacrifice almost anything to make Ape of God a masterpiece of its type.</p>
   <p>It was an unusual picturethere was no question about that. There's only one master print of the film, and it's kept in a locked vault at Summit. Very few have seen it. For what Machen had done in weird literature, Keene had done on the screenand it was literally amazing.</p>
   <p>I said to Worth, "Arnold Keene, eh? I've always had a sneaking sympathy for the man. But I thought he'd died long ago."</p>
   <p>"Oh, no. He bought a place near Tujunga and went into hiding. He didn't have much dough after the blow-up, you know, and it took him about five years to get together enough dinero to start his Nameless. He always said Ape of God was a failure, and that he intended to do a film that would be a masterpiece of weirdness. Well, he's done it. He's canned a film that'sunearthly. I tell you it made my flesh creep."</p>
   <p>"Who's the star?" I asked.</p>
   <p>"Unknowns. Russian trick, you know. The real star is aa shadow."</p>
   <p>I stared at him.</p>
   <p>"That's right, Pete. The shadow of something that's never shown on the screen. Doesn't sound like much, eh? But you ought to see it!"</p>
   <p>"I'd like to," I told him. "In fact, I'll do just that. Maybe he'll release it through Summit."</p>
   <p>Worth chuckled. "No chance. No studio would release that flicker. I'm not even going to play it up in my dirt sheet. This is the real McCoy, Pete."</p>
   <p>"What's Keene's address?" I asked.</p>
   <p>Worth gave it to me. "But don't go out till Wednesday night," he said. "The rough prints'll be ready then, or most of them. And keep it under you hat, of course."</p>
   <p>A group of autograph hunters came up just then, and Worth and I were separated. It didn't matter. I'd got all the information I needed. My mind was seething with fantastic surmises. Keene was one of the great geniuses of the screen, and his talent lay in the direction of the macabre. Unlike book publishers, the studios catered to no small, discriminating audiences. A film must suit everybody.</p>
   <p>Finally I broke away and took Ann to a dance at Bel-Air. But I hadn't forgotten Keene, and the next night I was too impatient to wait. I telephoned Worth, but he was out. Oddly enough, I was unable to get in touch with him during the next few days; even his paper couldn't help me. A furious editor told me the Associated Press had been sending him hourly telegrams asking for Worth's copy; but the man had vanished completely. I had a hunch.</p>
   <p>It was Tuesday night when I drove out of the studio and took a short cut through Griffith Park, past the Planetarium, to Glendale. From there I went on to Tujunga, to the address Worth had given me. Once or twice I had an uneasy suspicion that a black coupe was trailing me. but I couldn't be sure.</p>
   <p>Arnold Keene's house was in a little canyon hidden back in the Tujunga mountains. I had to follow a winding dirt road for several miles, and ford a stream or two, before I readied it. The place was built against the side of the canyon, and a man stood on the porch and watched me as I braked my car to a stop.</p>
   <p>It was Arnold Keene. I recognized him immediately. He was a slender man under middle height, with a closely cropped bristle of gray hair; his face was coldly austere. There had been a rumor that Keene had at one time been an officer in Prussia before he came to Hollywood and Americanized his name, and, scrutinizing him, I could well believe it. His eyes were like pale blue marbles, curiously shallow.</p>
   <p>He said, "Peter Haviland? I did not expect you until tomorrow night."</p>
   <p>I shook hands. "Sorry if I intrude," I apologized. "The fact is, I got impatient after what Worth told me about your film. He isn't here, by any chance?"</p>
   <p>The shallow eyes were unreadable. "No. But come in. Luckily, the developing took less time than I had anticipated. I need only a few more shots to complete my task."</p>
   <p>He ushered me into the house, which was thoroughly modern and comfortably furnished. Under the influence of good cognac my suspicions began to dissolve. I told Keene I had always admired his Ape of God.</p>
   <p>He made a wry grimace. "Amateurish, Haviland. I depended too much on hokum in that film. Merely devil-worship, a reincarnated Gilles de Rais, and sadism. That isn't true weirdness."</p>
   <p>I was interested. "That's correct. But the film had genuine power"</p>
   <p>"Man has nothing of the weird in him intrinsically. It is only the hints of the utterly abnormal and unhuman that give one the true feeling of weirdness. That, and human reactions to such supernatural phenomena. Look at any great weird workThe Horla, which tells of a man's reaction to a creature utterly alien, Blackwood's Willows, Machen's Black Seal, Lovecraft's Color Out of Spaceall these deal with the absolutely alien influencing normal lives, Sadism and death may contribute, but alone they cannot produce the true, intangible atmosphere of weirdness."</p>
   <p>I had read all these tales. "But you can't film the indescribable. How could you show the invisible beings of The Willows?"</p>
   <p>Keene hesitated. "I think I'll let my film answer that. I have a projection room downstairs"</p>
   <p>The bell rang sharply. I could not help noticing the quick glance Keene darted at me. With an apologetic gesture he went out and presently returned with Ann Howard at his side. She was smiling rather shakily.</p>
   <p>"Did you forget our date, Pete?" she asked me.</p>
   <p>I blinked, and suddenly remembered. Two weeks ago I had promised to take Ann to an affair in Laguna Beach this evening, but in my preoccupation with Keene's picture the date had slipped my mind. I stammered apologies.</p>
   <p>"Oh, that's all right," she broke in. "I'd much rather stay herethat is, if Mr. Keene doesn't mind. His picture"</p>
   <p>"You know about it?"</p>
   <p>"I told her," Keene said. "When she explained why she had come, I took the liberty of inviting her to stay to watch the film. I did not want her to drag you away, you see," he finished, smiling. "Some cognac for Misseh?"</p>
   <p>I introduced them.</p>
   <p>"For Miss Howard, and then The Nameless."</p>
   <p>At his words a tiny warning note seemed to throb in my brain. I had been fingering a heavy metal paperweight, and now, as Keene's attention was momentarily diverted to the sideboard, I slipped it, on a sudden impulse, into my pocket. It would be no defense, though, against a gun.</p>
   <p>What was wrong with me, I wondered? An atmosphere of distrust and suspicion seemed to have sprung out of nothing. As Keene ushered us down into his projection room, the skin of my back seemed to crawl with the expectation of attack. It was inexplicable, but definitely unpleasant.</p>
   <p>Keene was busy for a time in the projection booth, and then he joined us.</p>
   <p>"Modern machinery is a blessing," he said with heavy jocularity. "I can be as lazy as I wish. I needed no help with the shooting, once the automatic cameras were installed. The projector, too, is automatic."</p>
   <p>I felt Ann move closer to me in the gloom. I put my arm around her and said, "It helps, yes. What about releasing the picture, Mr. Keene?"</p>
   <p>There was a harsh note in his voice. "It will not be released. The world is uneducated, not ready for it. In a hundred years, perhaps, it will achieve the fame it deserves. I am doing it for posterity, and for the sake of creating a weird masterpiece on the screen."</p>
   <p>With a muffled click the projector began to operate, and a title flashed on the screen: The Nameless.</p>
   <p>Keene's voice came out of the darkness. "It's a silent film, except for one sequence at the start. Sound adds nothing to weirdness, and it helps to destroy the illusion of reality. Later, suitable music will be dubbed in."</p>
   <p>I did not answer. For a book had flashed on the gray oblong before usthat amazing tour de force, The Circus of Doctor Lao. A hand opened it, and a long finger followed the lines as a toneless voice read:</p>
   <p>"These are the sports, the offthrows of the universe instead of the species; these are the weird children of the lust of the spheres. Mysticism explains them where science cannot. Listen: when that great mysterious fecundity that peopled the worlds at the command of the gods had done with its birth-giving, when the celestial midwives all had left, when life had begun in the universe, the primal womb-thing found itself still unexhausted, its loins stiil potent. So that awful fertility tossed on its couch in a final fierce outbreak of life-giving and gave birth to these nightmare beings, these abortions of the world."</p>
   <p>The voice ceased. The book faded, and there swam into view a mass of tumbled ruins. The ages had pitted the man-carved rocks with cracks and scars; the bas-relief figures were scarcely recognizable. I was reminded of certain ruins I had seen in Yucatan.</p>
   <p>The camera swung down. The ruins seemed to grow larger. A yawning hole gaped in the earth.</p>
   <p>Beside me Keene said, "The site of a ruined temple. Watch, now."</p>
   <p>The effect was that of moving forward into the depths of a subterranean pit For a moment the screen was in darkness; then a stray beam of sunlight rested on an idol that stood in what was apparently an underground cavern. A narrow crack of light showed in the roof. The idol was starkly hideous.</p>
   <p>I got only a flashing glimpse, but the impression on my mind was that of a bulky, ovoid shape like a pineapple or a pine-cone. The thing had certain doubtful features which lent it a definitely unpleasant appearance; but it was gone in a flash, dissolving into a brightly lighted drawing-room, thronged with gay couples.</p>
   <p>The story proper began at that point. None of the actors or actresses was known to me; Keene must have hired them and worked secretly in his house. Most of the interiors and a few of the exteriors seemed to have been taken in this very canyon. The director had used the "parallel" trick which saves so much money for studios yearly. I'd often done it myself. It simply means that the story is tied in with real life as closely as possible; that is, when I had a troupe working up at Lake Arrowhead last winter, and an unexpected snowfall changed the scene, I had the continuity rewritten so that the necessary scenes could take place in snow. Similarly, Keene had paralleled his own experiencessometimes almost too closely.</p>
   <p>The Nameless told of a man, ostracized by his fellows because of his fanatical passion for the morbid and bizarre, who determined to create a work of arta living masterpiece of sheer weirdness. He had experimented before by directing films that were sufficiently unusual to stir up considerable comment. But this did not satisfy him. It was actingand he wanted something more than that. No one can convincingly fake reaction to horror, not even the most talented actor, he contended. The genuine emotion must be felt in order to be transferred to the screen.</p>
   <p>It was here that The Nameless ceased to parallel Keene's own experiences, and branched out into sheer fantasy. The protagonist in the film was Keene himself, but this was not unusual, as directors often act in their own productions. And, by deft montage shots, the audience learned that Keene in his search for authenticity had gone down into Mexico, and had, with the aid of an ancient scroll, found the site of a ruined Aztec temple. And here, as I say, reality was left behind as the film entered a morbid and extraordinary phase.</p>
   <p>There was a god hidden beneath this ruined templea long-forgotten god, which had been worshipped even before the Aztecs had sprung from the womb of the centuries. At least, the natives had considered it a god, and had erected a temple in its honor, but Keene hinted that the thing was actually a survival, one of the "offthrows of the universe," unique and baroque, which had come down through the eons in an existence totally alien to mankind. The creature was never actually seen on the screen, save for a few brief glimpses in the shadowed, underground temple. It was roughly barrel-shaped, and perhaps ten feet high, studded with odd spiky projections. The chief feature was a gem set in the thing's rounded apexa smoothly polished jewel as large as a child's head. It was in this gem that the being's life was supposed to have its focus.</p>
   <p>It was not dead, but neither was it alive, in the accepted sense of that term. When the Aztecs had filled the temple with the hot stench of blood the thing had lived, and the jewel had flamed with unearthly radiance. But with the passage of time the sacrifices had ceased, and the being had sunk into a state of coma akin to hibernation. In the picture Keene brought it to life.</p>
   <p>He transported it secretly to his home, and there, in an underground room hollowed beneath the house, he placed the monster-god. The room was built with an eye for the purpose for which Keene intended it: automatic cameras and clever lighting features were installed, so that pictures could be shot from several different angles at once, and pieced together later as Keene cut the film. And now there entered something of the touch of genius which had made Keene famous.</p>
   <p>He was clever, I had always realized that. Yet in the scenes that were next unfolded I admired not so much the technical trickswhich were familiar enough to meas the marvelously clever way in which Keene had managed to inject realism into the acting. His characters did not actthey lived</p>
   <p>Or, rather, they died. For in the picture they were thrust into the underground room to die horribly as sacrifices to the monster-god from the Aztec temple. Sacrifice was supposed to bring the thing to life, to cause the jewel in which its existence was bound to flare with fantastic splendor. The first sacrifice was, I think, the most effective.</p>
   <p>The underground room in which the god was hidden was large, but quite vacant, save for a curtained alcove which held the idol. A barred doorway led to the upper room, and here Keene appeared on the screen, revolver in hand, herding before him a manoverall-clad, with a stubble of black beard on his stolid face. Keene swung open the door, motioned his captive into the great room. He closed the barred door, and through the grating could be seen busy at a switchboard.</p>
   <p>Light flared. The man stood near the bars, and then, at Keene's gesture with his weapon, moved forward slowly to the far wall, He stood there, staring around vaguely, dull apprehension in his face. Light threw his shadow in bold relief on the wall.</p>
   <p>Then another shadow leaped into existence beside him.</p>
   <p>It was barrel-shaped, gigantic, studded with blunt spikes, and capped by a round dark blobthe life-jewel. The shadow of the monster god! The man saw it. He turned.</p>
   <p>Stark horror sprang into his face, and at sight of that utterly ghastly and realistic expression a chill struck through me. This was almost too convincing. The man could not be merely acting.</p>
   <p>But, if he was, his acting was superb, and so was Keene's direction. The shadow on the wall stirred, and a thrill of movement shook it. It rocked and seemed to rise, supported by a dozen tentacular appendages that uncoiled from beneath its base. The spikeschanged. They lengthened. They coiled and writhed, hideously worm-like.</p>
   <p>It wasn't the metamorphosis of the shadow that held me motionless in my chair. Rather, it was the appalling expression of sheer horror on the man's face. He stood gaping as the shadow toppled and swayed on the wall, growing larger and larger. Then he fled, his mouth an open square of terror. The shadow paused, with an odd air of indecision, and slipped slowly along the wall out of range of the camera.</p>
   <p>But there were other cameras, and Keene had used his cutting-shears deftly. The movements of the man were mirrored on the screen; the glaring lights swung and flared; and ever the grim shadow crawled hideously across the wall. The thing that cast it was never shownjust the shadow, and it was a dramatically effective trick. Too many directors, I knew, could not have resisted the temptation to show the monster, thus destroying the illusionfor papier-mache and rubber, no matter how cleverly constructed, cannot convincingly ape reality.</p>
   <p>At last the shadows mergedthe gigantic swaying thing with its coiling tentacles, and the black shadow of the man that was caught and lifted, struggling and kicking frantically. The shadows mergedand the man did not reappear. Only the dark blob capping the great shadow faded and flickered, as though strange light were streaming from it; the light that was fed by sacrifice, the jewel that waslife.</p>
   <p>Beside me there came a rustle. I felt Ann stir and move closer in the gloom. Keene's voice came from some distance away.</p>
   <p>"There were several more sacrifice scenes, Haviland, but I haven't patched them in yet, except for the one you'll see in a moment now. As I said, the film isn't finished."</p>
   <p>I did not answer. My eyes were on the screen as the fantastic tale unfolded. The pictured Keene was bringing another victim to his cavern, a short, fat man with sleekly pomaded black hair. I did not see his face until he had been imprisoned in the cave, and then, abruptly, there came a close-up shot, probably done with a telescopic lens. His plump face, with its tiny mustache, leaped into gigantic visibility, and I recognized Andy Worth.</p>
   <p>It was the missing columnist, but for the first time I saw his veneer of sophistication lacking. Naked fear crawled in his eyes, and I leaned forward in my seat as the ghastly barrel-shaped shadow sprang out on the wall. Worth saw it, and the expression on his face was shocking. I pushed back my chair and got up as the lights came on. The screen went blank.</p>
   <p>Arnold Keene was standing by the door, erect and military as ever. He had a gun in his hand, and its muzzle was aimed at my stomach.</p>
   <p>"You had better sit down, Haviland," he said quietly. "You too, Miss Howard. I've something to tell youand I don't wish to be melodramatic about it. This gun"he glanced at it wryly"is necessary. There are a few things you must know, Haviland, for a reason you'll understand later."</p>
   <p>I said, "There'll be some visitors here for you soon, Keene. You don't think I'd neglect normal precautions!"</p>
   <p>He shrugged. "You're lying, of course. Also you're unarmed, or you'd have had your gun out by now. I didn't expect you until tomorrow night, but I'm prepared. In a word, what I have to tell you is this: the film you just saw is a record of actual events."</p>
   <p>Ann's teeth sank into her lip, but I didn't say anything. I waited, and Keene resumed.</p>
   <p>"Whether you believe me or not doesn't matter, for you'll have to believe in a few minutes. I told you something of my motive, my desire to create a genuine masterpiece of weirdness. That's what I've done, or will have done before tomorrow. Quite a number of vagrants and laborers have disappeared, and the columnist, Worth, as well; but I took care to leave no clues. You'll be the last to vanishyou and this girl."</p>
   <p>"You'll never be able to show the film," I told him.</p>
   <p>"What of it? You're a hack, Haviland, and you can't understand what it means to create a masterpiece. Is a work of art any less beautiful because it's hidden? I'll see the pictureand after I'm dead the world will see it, and realize my genius even though they may fear and hate its expression. The reactions of my unwilling actorsthat's the trick. As a director, you should know that there's no substitute for realism. The reactions were not fakedthat was obvious enough. The first sacrifice was that of a clodan unintelligent moron, whose fears were largely superstitious. The next sacrifice was of a higher typea vagrant who came begging to my door some months ago. You will complete the group, for you'll know just what you're facing, and your attempt to rationalize your fear will lend an interesting touch. Both of you will stand up, with your hands in the air, and precede me into this passage."</p>
   <p>All this came out tonelessly and swiftly, quite as though it were a rehearsed speech. His hand slid over the wall beside him, and a black oblong widened in the oak paneling. I stood up.</p>
   <p>"Do as he says, Ann," I said. "Maybe I can"</p>
   <p>"No, you can't," Keene interrupted, gesturing impatiently with his weapon. "You won't have the chance. Hurry up."</p>
   <p>We went through the opening in the wall and Keene followed, touching a stud that flooded the passage with light. It was a narrow tunnel that slanted down through solid rock for perhaps ten feet to a steep stairway. He herded us down this, after sliding the panel shut.</p>
   <p>"It's well hidden," he said, indicating metal sheathingindeed, the entire corridor was lined with metal plates. "This lever opens it from within, but no one but me can find the spring which opens it from without. The police could wreck the house without discovering this passage."</p>
   <p>That seemed worth remembering, but of little practical value at the moment. Ann and I went down the stairway until it ended in another short passage. Our way was blocked by a door of steel bars, which Keene unlocked with a key he took from his pocket. The passage where we stood was dimly lighted; there were several chairs here; and the space beyond the barred door was not lighted at all.</p>
   <p>Keene opened the door and gestured me through it. He locked it behind me and turned to Ann. Her face, I saw, was paper-white in the pale glow.</p>
   <p>What happened after that brought an angry curse to my lips. Without warning Keene swung the automatic in a short. vicious arc, smashing it against Ann's head.</p>
   <p>She saw it coming too late, and her upflung hand failed to ward off the blow. She dropped without a sound, a little trickle of blood oozing from her temple. Keene stepped over her body to a switchboard set in the rock wall.</p>
   <p>Light lanced with intolerable brilliance into my eyes. I shut them tightly, opening them after a moment to stare around apprehensively. I recognized my surroundings. I was in the cave of sacrifice, the underground den I had seen on the screen. Cameras high up on the walls began to operate as I discovered them. From various points blinding arc-lights streamed down upon me.</p>
   <p>A gray curtain shielded a space on the far wall, but this was drawn upward to reveal a deep alcove. There was an object within that nichea barrel-shaped thing ten feet high, studded with spikes, and crowned with a jewel that pulsed and glittered with cold flame. It was gray and varnished-looking, and it was the original of Keene's Aztec god.</p>
   <p>Somehow I felt oddly reassured as I examined the thing. It was a model, of course, inanimate and dead; for certainly no life of any kind could exist in such an abnormality. Keene might have installed machinery of some sort within it, however.</p>
   <p>"You see, Haviland," Keene said from beyond the bars, "the thing actually exists. I got on the trail of it in an old parchment I found in the Huntington Library. It had been considered merely an interesting bit of folk-lore, but I saw something else in it. When I was making Ape of God in Mexico I discovered the ruined temple, and what lay forgotten behind the altar."</p>
   <p>He touched a switch, and light streamed out from the alcove behind the thing. Swiftly I turned. On the wall behind me was my own shadow, grotesquely elongated, and beside it was the squat, amorphous patch of blackness I had seen on the screen upstairs.</p>
   <p>My back was toward Keene, and my ringers crept into my pocket, touching the metal paperweight I had dropped there earlier that evening. Briefly I considered the possibility of hurling the thing at Keene, and then decided against it. The bars were too close together, and the man would shoot me at any sign of dangerous hostility.</p>
   <p>My eyes were drawn to the shadow on the wall. It was moving.</p>
   <p>It rocked slightly, and lifted. The spikes lengthened. The thing was no longer inanimate and dead, and as I swung about, stark amazement gripping me, I saw the incredible metamorphosis that had taken place in the thing that cast the shadow.</p>
   <p>It was no longer barrel-shaped. A dozen smooth, glistening appendages, ending in flat pads, supported the snake-thin body. And all over that grayish upright pole tentacles sprouted and lengthened, writhing into ghastly life as the horror awakened. Keene had not lied, and the monstrous survival he had brought from the Aztec temple was lumbering from the alcove, its myriad tentacles alive with frightful hunger!</p>
   <p>Keene saved me. He saw me standing motionless with abysmal fear in the path of that gigantic, nightmare being, and realizing that he was being cheated of his picture, the man shouted at me to run. His hoarse voice broke the spell that held me unmoving, and I whirled and fled across the cave to the barred door. Skin ripped from my hands as I tore at the bars.</p>
   <p>"Run!" Keene yelled at me, his shallow eyes blazing. "It can't move fast! Look out"</p>
   <p>A writhing, snake-like thing lashed out, and a sickening musky stench filled my nostrils. I leaped away, racing across the cave again. The arc-lights died and others flared into being as Keene manipulated the switchboard. He was adjusting the lights, so that our shadows would not be lostso that in the climax of The Nameless the shadow of that ghastly horror would be thrown on the cave wail beside me.</p>
   <p>It was an infernal game of tag we played there, in those shifting Lights that glared down while the camera lenses watched dispassionately. I fled and dodged with my pulses thundering and blood pounding in my temples, and ever the grim shadow moved slowly across the walls, while my legs began to ache with the strain. For hours, perhaps, or eons, I fled.</p>
   <p>There would come brief periods of respite when I would cling to the bars, cursing Keene, but he would not answer. His hands flickered over the switchboard as he adjusted the arc-lights, and his eyes never paused in their roving examination of the cave. In the end it was this that saved me.</p>
   <p>For Keene did not see Ann stir and open her eyes. He did not see the girl, after a swift glance around, get quietly to her feet. Luckily she was behind Keene, and he did not turn.</p>
   <p>I tried to keep my eyes away from Ann, but I do not think I succeeded. At the last moment I saw Keene's face change, and he started back; but the chair in Ann's hands crashed down and splintered on the man's head. He fell to his knees, clawing at the air, and then collapsed inertly.</p>
   <p>I was on the far side of the cave, and my attention was momentarily diverted from the monster. I had been watching it from the corner of my eye, expecting to be able to dodge and leap away before it came too close; but it lumbered forward with a sudden burst of speed. Although I tried to spring clear I failed; a tentacle whipped about my legs and sent me sprawling. As I tried to roll away another smooth gray coil got my left arm.</p>
   <p>Intolerable agony dug into my shoulder as I was lifted. I heard Ann scream, and a gun barked angrily. Bullets plopped into the smooth flesh of the monster, but it paid no attention. I was lifted through a welter of coiling, ropy tentacles, until just above me was the flaming jewel in which the creature's life was centered.</p>
   <p>Remembrance of Keene's words spurred me to action; this might be the monster's vulnerable point. The paperweight was still in my pocket, and I clawed it out desperately. I hurled it with all my strength at the shining gem. And the jewel shattered!</p>
   <p>There came a shrill vibration, like the tinkling of countless tiny crystalline bells. Piercingly sweet, it shrilled in my ears, and died away quickly. And suddenly nothing existed but light.</p>
   <p>It was as though the shattering of the gem had released a sea of incandescent flame imprisoned within it. The glare of the arc-lights faded beside this flood of silvery radiance that bathed me. The cold glory of Arcturus, the blaze of tropical moonlight, were in the light.</p>
   <p>Swiftly it faded and fled away. I felt myself dropping, and pain lanced into my wrenched shoulder as I struck the ground. I heard Ann's voice.</p>
   <p>Dazedly I got up, expecting to see the monster towering above me. But it was gone. In its place, a few feet away, was the barrel-shaped thing I had first seen in the alcove. There was a gaping cavity in the rounded apex where the jewel had been. And, somehow, I sensed that the creature was no longer deadly, no longer a horror.</p>
   <p>I saw Ann. She was still holding Keene's gun, and in her other hand was the key with which she had unlocked the door. She came running toward me, and I went swiftly to meet her.</p>
   <p>I took the gun and made sure it was loaded. "Come on," I said, curtly. "We're getting out of here."</p>
   <p>Ann's fingers were gripping my arm tightly as we went through the door, past the prone figure of Keene, and up the stairway. The lever behind the panel was not difficult to operate, and I followed Ann through the opening into the theater. Then I paused, listening.</p>
   <p>Ann turned, watching me, a question in her eyes. "What is it, Pete?"</p>
   <p>"Listen," I said. "Get the cans of film from the projection booth. We'll take them with us and burn them."</p>
   <p>"Butyou're not"</p>
   <p>"I'll be with you in a minute," I told her, and swung the panel shut.</p>
   <p>I went down the stairs swiftly and very quietly, my gun ready and my ears alert for the low muttering I had heard from below.</p>
   <p>Keene was no longer unconscious. He was standing beside the switchboard with his back to me, and over his shoulder I could see the shadow of the monster-god sprawling on the wall, inert and lifeless. Keene was chanting something, in a language I did not know, and his hands were moving in strange gestures.</p>
   <p>God knows what unearthly powers Keene had acquired in his search for horror! For as I stood there, watching the patch of blackness on the cave wall, I saw a little shudder rock that barrel-shaped shadow of horror, while a single spike abruptly lengthened into a tentacle that groped out furtively and drew back and vanished.</p>
   <p>Then I killed Arnold Keene.</p>

   <p><emphasis>Fra Rafael saw strange things, impossible things. Then there was the mystery of the seven young virginal girls of Huascan.</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Fra Rafael drew the llama-wool blanket closer about his narrow shoulders, shivering in the cold wind that screamed down from Huascan. His face held great pain. I rose, walked to the door of the hut and peered through fog at the shadowy haunted lands that lifted toward the sky--the Cordilleras that make a rampart along Peru's eastern border.</p>
   <p>"There's nothing," I said. "Only the fog, Fra Rafael."</p>
   <p>He made the sign of the cross on his breast. "It is the fog that brings the--the terror," he said. "I tell you, Señor White, I have seen strange things these last few months--impossible things. You are a scientist. Though we are not of the same religion, you also know that there are powers not of this earth."</p>
   <p>I didn't answer, so he went on: "Three months ago it began, after the earthquake. A native girl disappeared. She was seen going into the mountains, toward Huascan along the Pass, and she did not come back. I sent men out to find her. They went up the Pass, found the fog grew thicker and thicker until they were blind and could see nothing. Fear came to them and they fled back down the mountain. A week later another girl vanished. We found her footprints."</p>
   <p>"The same canyon?"</p>
   <p>"Si, and the same result. Now seven girls have gone, one after the other, all in the same way. And I, Señor White--" Fra Rafael's pale, tired face was sad as he glanced down at the stumps of his legs--"I could not follow, as you see. Four years ago an avalanche crippled me. My bishop told me to return to Lima, but I prevailed on him to let me remain here for these natives are my people, Señor. They know and trust me. The loss of my legs has not altered that."</p>
   <p>I nodded. "I can see the difficulty now, though."</p>
   <p>"Exactly. I cannot go to Huascan and find out what has happened to the girls. The natives--well, I chose four of the strongest and bravest and asked them to take me up the Pass. I thought that I could overcome their superstitions. But I was not successful."</p>
   <p>"How far did you go?" I asked.</p>
   <p>"A few miles, not more than that. The fog grew thicker, until we were blinded by it, and the way was dangerous. I could not make the men go on." Fra Rafael closed his eyes wearily. "They talked of old Inca gods and devils--Manco Capac and Oello Huaco, the Children of the Sun. They are very much afraid, Señor White. They huddle together like sheep and believe that an ancient god has returned and is taking them away one by one. And--one by one they are taken."</p>
   <p>"Only young girls," I mused. "And no coercion is used, apparently. What's up toward Huascan?"</p>
   <p>"Nothing but wild llamas and the condors. And snow, cold, desolation. These are the Andes, my friend."</p>
   <p>"Okay," I said. "It sounds interesting. As an anthropologist I owe it to the Foundation to investigate. Besides, I'm curious. Superficially, there is nothing very strange about the affair. Seven girls have disappeared in the unusually heavy fogs we've had ever since the earthquake. Nothing more."</p>
   <p>I smiled at him. "However, I think I'll take a look around and see what's so attractive about Huascan."</p>
   <p>"I shall pray for you," he said. "Perhaps--well, Señor, for all the loss of my legs, I am not a weak man. I can stand much hardship. I can ride a burro."</p>
   <p>"I don't doubt your willingness, Fra Rafael," I said. "But it's necessary to be practical. It's dangerous and it's cold up there. Your presence would only handicap me. Alone, I can go faster--remember, I don't know how far I'll have to travel."</p>
   <p>The priest sighed. "I suppose you are right. When--"</p>
   <p>"Now. My burro's packed."</p>
   <p>"Your porters?"</p>
   <p>"They won't go," I said wryly. "They've been talking to your villagers. It doesn't matter. I'll go it alone." I put out my hand, and Fra Rafael gripped it strongly.</p>
   <p>"Vaya con Dios," he said.</p>
   <p>I went out into the bright Peruvian sunlight. The Indios were standing in straggling knots, pretending not to watch me. My porters were nowhere in evidence. I grinned, yelled a sardonic goodbye, and started to lead the burro toward the Pass.</p>
   <p>The fog vanished as the sun rose, but it still lay in the mountain canyons toward the west. A condor circled against the sky. In the thin, sharp air the sound of a distant rock-fall was distinctly audible.</p>
   <p>White Huascan towered far away. A shadow fell on me as I entered the Pass. The burro plodded on, patient and obedient. I felt a little chill; the fog began to thicken.</p>
   <p>Yes, the Indios had talked to me. I knew their language, their old religion. Bastard descendants of the Incas, they still preserved a deep-rooted belief in the ancient gods of their ancient race, who had fallen with Huayna Capac, the Great Inca, a year before Pizarro came raging into Peru. I knew the Quichua--the old tongue of the mother race--and so I learned more than I might have otherwise.</p>
   <p>Yet I had not learned much. The Indios said that something had come into the mountains near Huascan. They were willing to talk about it, but they knew little. They shrugged with apathetic fatalism. It called the young virgins, no doubt for a sacrifice. Quien sabe? Certainly the strange, thickening fog was not of this earth. Never before in the history of mankind had there been such a fog. It was, of course, the earthquake that had brought the--the Visitant. And it was folly to seek it out.</p>
   <p>Well, I was an anthropologist and knew the value of even such slight clues as this. Moreover, my job for the Foundation was done. My specimens had been sent through to Callao by pack-train, and my notes were safe with Fra Rafael. Also, I was young and the lure of far places and their mysteries was hot in my blood. I hoped I'd find something odd--even dangerous--at Huascan.</p>
   <p>I was young. Therefore, somewhat of a fool....</p>
   <p>The first night I camped in a little cave, sheltered from the wind and snug enough in my fleece-lined sleeping-bag. There were no insects at this height. It was impossible to make a fire for there was no wood. I worried a bit about the burro freezing in the night.</p>
   <p>But he survived, and I repacked him the next morning with rather absurd cheerfulness. The fog was thick, yes, but not impenetrable.</p>
   <p>There were tracks in the snow where the wind had not covered them. A girl had left the village the day before my arrival, which made my task all the easier. So I went up into that vast, desolate silence, the fog closing in steadily, getting thicker and thicker, the trail getting narrower until at last it was a mere track.</p>
   <p>And then I was moving blind. I had to feel my way, step by step, leading the burro. Occasional tracks showed through the mist, showed that the native girl had walked swiftly--had run in places--so I assumed that the fog was less dense when she had come by this way. As it happened, I was quite wrong about that....</p>
   <p>We were on a narrow path above a gorge when I lost the burro. I heard a scrambling and clashing of hoofs on rock behind me. The rope jerked out of my hand and the animal cried out almost articulately as it went over. I stood frozen, pressing against the stone, listening to the sound of the burro's fall. Finally the distant noise died in a faint trickling of snow and gravel that faded into utter silence. So thick was the fog that I had seen nothing.</p>
   <p>I felt my way back to where the path had crumbled and rotten rock had given way under the burro's weight. It was possible for me to retrace my steps, but I did not. I was sure that my destination could not be much further. A lightly clad native girl could not have gone so far as Huascan itself. No, probably that day I would reach my goal.</p>
   <p>So I went on, feeling my way through the thick silent fog. I was able to see only a few inches ahead of me for hours. Then, abruptly the trail grew clearer. Until, at last I was moving in the shadowless, unearthly mist over hard-packed snow, following the clearly marked footprints of a girl's sandals.</p>
   <p>Then they vanished without warning, those prints, and I stood hesitant, staring around. I could see nothing, but a brighter glow in the misty canopy overhead marked the sun's position.</p>
   <p>I knelt and brushed away the snow with my hands, hoping to undo the wind's concealing work. But I found no more footprints. Finally I took my bearings as well as I could and ploughed ahead in the general direction the girl had been traveling.</p>
   <p>My compass told me I was heading due north.</p>
   <p>The fog was a living, sentient thing now, secretive, shrouding the secret that lay beyond its gray wall.</p>
   <p>Suddenly I was conscious of a change. An electric tingle coursed through my body. Abruptly the fog-wall brightened. Dimly, as through a translucent pane, I could make out vague images ahead of me.</p>
   <p>I began to move toward the images--and suddenly the fog was gone!</p>
   <p>Before me lay a valley. Blue-white moss carpeted it except where reddish boulders broke the blueness. Here and there were trees--at least I assumed they were trees, despite their unfamiliar outline. They were like banyans, having dozens of trunks narrow as bamboo. Blue-leafed, they stood like immense bird-cages on the pallid moss. The fog closed in behind the valley and above it. It was like being in a huge sun-lit cavern.</p>
   <p>I turned my head, saw a gray wall behind me. Beneath my feet the snow was melting and running in tiny, trickling rivulets among the moss. The air was warm and stimulating as wine.</p>
   <p>A strange and abrupt change. Impossibly strange! I walked toward one of the trees, stopped at a reddish boulder to examine it. And surprise caught at my throat. It was an artifact--a crumbling ruin, the remnant of an ancient structure whose original appearance I could not fathom. The stone seemed iron-hard. There were traces of inscription on it, but eroded to illegibility. And I never did learn the history of those enigmatic ruins.... They did not originate on Earth.</p>
   <p>There was no sign of the native girl, and the resilient moss retained no tracks. I stood there, staring around, wondering what to do now. I was tense with excitement. But there was little to see. Just that valley covering perhaps a half-mile before the fog closed in around it.</p>
   <p>Beyond that--I did not know what lay beyond that.</p>
   <p>I went on, into the valley, eyeing my surroundings curiously in the shadowless light that filtered through the shifting roof of fog. Foolishly, I expected to discover Incan artifacts. The crumbled red stones should have warned me. They were, I think, harder than metal, yet they had been here long enough for the elements to erode them into featureless shards. Had they been of earthly origin they would have antedated Mankind--antedated even the Neanderthaler man.</p>
   <p>Curious how our minds are conditioned to run in anthropomorphic lines. I was, though I did not know it, walking through a land that had its beginnings outside the known universe. The blue trees hinted at that. The crimson ruins told me that clearly. The atmospheric conditions--the fog, the warmth high up in the Cordilleras--were certainly not natural. Yet I thought the explanation lay in some geological warp, volcanic activity, subterranean gas-vents....</p>
   <p>My vision reached a half-mile, no farther. As I went on, the misty horizon receded. The valley was larger than I had imagined. It was like Elysium, where the shades of dead men stroll in the Garden of Proserpine. Streamlets ran through the blue moss at intervals, chill as death from the snowy plains hidden in the fog. "A sleepy world of streams...."</p>
   <p>The ruins altered in appearance as I went on. The red blocks were still present, but there were now also remnants of other structures, made by a different culture, I thought.</p>
   <p>The blue trees grew more numerous. Leafy vines covered most of them now, saffron-tinted, making each strange tree a little room, screened by the lattice of the vines. As I passed close to one a faint clicking sounded, incongruously like the tapping of typewriter keys, but muffled. I saw movement and turned, my hand going to the pistol in my belt.</p>
   <p>The Thing came out of a tree-hut and halted, watching me. I felt it watching me--though it had no eyes!</p>
   <p>It was a sphere of what seemed to be translucent plastic, glowing with shifting rainbow colors. And I sensed sentience--intelligence--in its horribly human attitude of watchful hesitation. Four feet in diameter it was, and featureless save for three ivory elastic tentacles that supported it and a fringe of long, whip-like cilia about its diameter--its waist, I thought.</p>
   <p>It looked at me, eyeless and cryptic. The shifting colors crawled over the plastic globe. Then it began to roll forward on the three supporting tentacles with a queer, swift gliding motion. I stepped back, jerking out my gun and leveling it.</p>
   <p>"Stop," I said, my voice shrill. "Stop!"</p>
   <p>It stopped, quite as though it understood my words or the gesture of menace. The cilia fluttered about its spherical body. Bands of lambent color flashed. I could not rid myself of the curious certainty, that it was trying to communicate with me.</p>
   <p>Abruptly it came forward again purposefully. I tensed and stepped back, holding the gun aimed. My finger was tightening on the trigger when the Thing stopped.</p>
   <p>I backed off, nervously tense, but the creature did not follow. After I had got about fifty yards away it turned back and retreated into the hut-like structure in the banyan tree. After that I watched the trees warily as I passed them, but there were no other visitations of that nature.</p>
   <p>Scientists are reluctant to relinquish their so-called logic. As I walked I tried to rationalize the creature, to explain it in the light of current knowledge. That it had been alive was certain. Yet it was not protoplasmic in nature. A plant, developed by mutation? Perhaps. But that theory did not satisfy me for the Thing had possessed intelligence, though of what order I did not know.</p>
   <p>But there were the seven native girls, I reminded myself. My job was to find them, and quickly, too.</p>
   <p>I did, at last, find them. Six of them, anyway. They were sitting in a row on the blue moss, facing one of the red blocks of stone, their backs toward me. As I mounted a little rise I saw them, motionless as bronze statues, and as rigid.</p>
   <p>I went down toward them, tense with excitement, expectancy. Odd that six native girls, sitting in a row, should fill me with such feeling. They were so motionless that I wondered as I approached them, if they were dead....</p>
   <p>But they were not. Nor were they--in the true sense of the word--alive.</p>
   <p>I gripped one by the bare shoulder, found the flesh surprisingly cold and the girl seemed not to feel my touch. I swung her around to face me, and her black, empty eyes looked off into the far distance. Her lips were tightly compressed, slightly cyanosed. The pupils of her eyes were inordinately dilated, as if she was drugged.</p>
   <p>Indian style, she squatted cross-legged, like the others. As I pulled her around, she toppled down on the moss, making no effort to stop herself. For a moment she lay there. Then with slow, puppet-like motions, she returned to her former position and resumed that blank staring into space.</p>
   <p>I looked at the others. They were alike in their sleep-like withdrawal. It seemed as if their minds had been sucked out of them, that their very selves were elsewhere. It was a fantastic diagnosis, of course. But the trouble with those girls was nothing a physician could understand. It was psychic in nature, obviously.</p>
   <p>I turned to the first one and slapped her cheeks. "Wake up!" I commanded. "You must obey me! Waken--"</p>
   <p>But she gave no sign of feeling, of seeing. I lit a match, and her eyes focused on the flame. But the size of her pupils did not alter....</p>
   <p>A shudder racked me. Then, abruptly I sensed movement behind me. I turned....</p>
   <p>Over the blue moss the seventh Indio girl was coming toward us. "Miranda!" I said. "Can you hear me?" Fra Rafael had told me her name. Her feet, I saw, were bare and white frost-bite blotches marked them. But she did not seem to feel any pain as she walked.</p>
   <p>Then I became aware that this was not a simple Indio girl. Something deep within my soul suddenly shrank back with instinctive revulsion. My skin seemed to crawl with a sort of terror. I began to shake so that it was difficult to draw my gun from its holster.</p>
   <p>There was just this young native girl walking slowly toward me, her face quite expressionless, her black eyes fixed on emptiness. Yet she was not like other Indios, not like the six other girls sitting behind me. I can only liken her to a lamp in which a hot flame burned. The others were lamps that were dead, unlit.</p>
   <p>The flame in her was not one that had been kindled on this earth, or in this universe, or in this space-time continuum, either. There was life in the girl who had been Miranda Valle--but it was not human life!</p>
   <p>Some distant, skeptical corner of my brain told me that this was pure insanity, that I was deluded, hallucinated. Yes, I knew that. But it did not seem to matter. The girl who was walking so quietly across the blue yielding moss had wrapped about her, like an invisible, intangible veil, something of the alienage that men, through the eons, have called divinity. No mere human, I thought, could touch her.</p>
   <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
   <p>But I felt fear, loathing--emotions not associated with divinity. I watched, knowing that presently she would look at me, would realize my presence. Then--well, my mind would not go beyond that point....</p>
   <p>She came forward and quietly seated herself with the others, at the end of the line. Her body stiffened rigidly. Then, the veil of terror seemed to leave her, like a cloak falling away. Abruptly she was just an Indio girl, empty and drained as the others, mindless and motionless.</p>
   <p>The girl beside her rose suddenly with a slow, fluid motion. And the crawling horror hit me again.... The Alien Power had not left! It had merely transferred itself to another body!</p>
   <p>And this second body was as dreadful to my senses as the first had been. In some subtly monstrous way its terror impressed itself on my brain, though all the while there was nothing overt, nothing visibly wrong. The strange landscape, bounded by fog, was not actually abnormal, considering its location, high in the Andes. The blue moss, the weird trees; they were strange, but possible. Even the seven native girls were a normal part of the scene. It was the sense of an alien presence that caused my terror--a fear of the unknown....</p>
   <p>As the newly "possessed" girl rose, I turned and fled, deathly sick, feeling caught in the grip of nightmare. Once I stumbled and fell. As I scrambled wildly to my feet I looked back.</p>
   <p>The girl was watching me, her face tiny and far away. Then, suddenly, abruptly it was close. She stood within a few feet of me! I had not moved nor seen her move, but we were all close together again--the seven girls and I....</p>
   <p>Hypnosis? Something of that sort. She had drawn me back to her, my mind blacked out and unresisting. I could not move. I could only stand motionless while that Alien being dwelling within human flesh reached out and thrust frigid fingers into my soul. I could feel my mind laid open, spread out like a map before the inhuman gaze that scanned it. It was blasphemous and shameful, and I could not move or resist!</p>
   <p>I was flung aside as the psychic grip that held me relaxed. I could not think clearly. That remote delving into my brain had made me blind, sick, frantic. I remember running....</p>
   <p>But I remember very little of what followed. There are vague pictures of blue moss and twisted trees, of coiling fog that wrapped itself about me, trying futilely to hold me back. And always there was the sense of a dark and nameless horror just beyond vision, hidden from me--though I was not hidden from its eyeless gaze!</p>
   <p>I remember reaching the wall of fog, saw it loomed before me, plunged into it, raced through cold grayness, snow crunching beneath my boots. I recall emerging again into that misty valley of Abaddon....</p>
   <p>When I regained complete consciousness I was with Lhar.</p>
   <p>A coolness as of limpid water moved through my mind, cleansing it, washing away the horror, soothing and comforting me. I was lying on my back looking up at an arabesque pattern of blue and saffron; gray-silver light filtered through a lacy, filigree. I was still weak but the blind terror no longer gripped me.</p>
   <p>I was inside a hut formed by the trunks of one of the banyan-like trees. Slowly, weakly I rose on one elbow. The room was empty except for a curious flower that grew from the dirt floor beside me. I looked at it dazedly.</p>
   <p>And so I met Lhar.... She was of purest white, the white of alabaster, but with a texture and warmth that stone does not have. In shape--well, she seemed to be a great flower, an unopened tulip-like blossom five feet or so tall. The petals were closely enfolded, concealing whatever sort of body lay hidden beneath, and at the base was a convoluted pedestal that gave the odd impression of a ruffled, tiny skirt. Even now I cannot describe Lhar coherently. A flower, yes--but very much more than that. Even in that first glimpse I knew that Lhar was more than just a flower....</p>
   <p>I was not afraid of her. She had saved me, I knew, and I felt complete trust in her. I lay back as she spoke to me telepathically, her words and thoughts forming within my brain....</p>
   <p>"You are well now, though still weak. But it is useless for you to try to escape from this valley. No one can escape. The Other has powers I do not know, and those powers will keep you here."</p>
   <p>I said, "You are--?"</p>
   <p>A name formed within my mind. "Lhar. I am not of your world."</p>
   <p>A shudder shook her. And her distress forced itself on me. I stood up, swaying with weakness. Lhar drew back, moving with a swaying, bobbing gait oddly like a curtsey.</p>
   <p>Behind me a clicking sounded. I turned, saw the many-colored sphere force itself through the banyan-trunks. Instinctively my hand went to my gun. But a thought from Lhar halted me.</p>
   <p>"It will not harm you. It is my servant." She hesitated, groping for a word. "A machine. A robot. It will not harm you."</p>
   <p>I said, "Is it intelligent?"</p>
   <p>"Yes. But it is not alive. Our people made it. We have many such machines."</p>
   <p>The robot swayed toward me, the rim of cilia flashing and twisting. Lhar said, "It speaks thus, without words or thought...." She paused, watching the sphere, and I sensed dejection in her manner.</p>
   <p>The robot turned to me. The cilia twisted lightly about my arm, tugging me toward Lhar. I said, "What does it want?"</p>
   <p>"It knows that I am dying," Lhar said.</p>
   <p>That shocked me. "Dying? No!"</p>
   <p>"It is true. Here in this alien world I do not have my usual food. So I will die. To survive I need the blood of mammals. But there are none here save those seven the Other has taken. And I cannot use them for they are now spoiled."</p>
   <p>I didn't ask Lhar what sort of mammals she had in her own world. "That's what the robot wanted when it tried to stop me before, isn't it?"</p>
   <p>"He wanted you to help me, yes. But you are weak from the shock you have had. I cannot ask you--"</p>
   <p>I said, "How much blood do you need?"</p>
   <p>At her answer, I said, "All right. You saved my life; I must do the same for you. I can spare that much blood easily. Go ahead."</p>
   <p>She bowed toward me, a fluttering white flame in the dimness of the tree-room. A tendril flicked out from among her petals, wrapped itself about my arm. It felt cool, gentle as a woman's hand. I felt no pain.</p>
   <p>"You must rest now," Lhar said. "I will go away but I shall not be long."</p>
   <p>The robot clicked and chattered, shifting on its tentacle legs. I watched it, saying, "Lhar, this can't be true. Why am I--believing impossible things?"</p>
   <p>"I have given you peace," she told me. "Your mind was dangerously close to madness. I have drugged you a little, physically; so your emotions will not be strong for a while. It was necessary to save your sanity."</p>
   <p>It was true that my mind felt--was drugged the word? My thoughts were clear enough, but I felt as if I were submerged in transparent but dark water. There was an odd sense of existing in a dream. I remembered Swinburne's lines:</p>
   <p>Here, where the world is quiet, Here, where all trouble seems Dead winds' and spent waves' riot In doubtful dreams of dreams....</p>
   <p>"What is this place?" I asked.</p>
   <p>Lhar bent toward me. "I do not know if I can explain. It is not quite clear to me. The robot knows. He is a reasoning machine. Wait...." She turned to the sphere. Its cilia fluttered in quick, complicated signals.</p>
   <p>Lhar turned back to me. "Do you know much of the nature of Time? That it is curved, moves in a spiral...."</p>
   <p>She went on to explain, but much of her explanation I did not understand. Yet I gathered enough to realize that this valley was not of Earth. Or, rather, it was not of the earth I knew.</p>
   <p>"You have geological disturbances, I know. The strata are tumbled about, mixed one with another--"</p>
   <p>I remembered what Fra Rafael had said about an earthquake, three months before. Lhar nodded toward me.</p>
   <p>"But this was a time-slip. The space-time continuum is also subject to great strains and stresses. It buckled, and strata--Time-sectors--were thrust up to mingle with others. This valley belongs to another age, as do I and the machine, and also--the Other."</p>
   <p>She told me what had happened.... There had been no warning. One moment she had been in her own World, her own Time. The next, she was here, with her robot. And with the Other....</p>
   <p>"I do not know the origin of the Other. I may have lived in either your future or your past. This valley, with its ruined stone structures, is probably part of your future. I had never heard of such a place before. The Other may be of the future also. Its shape I do not know...."</p>
   <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
   <p>She told me more, much more. The Other, as she called it--giving the entity a thought-form that implied complete alienage--had a strangely chameleon-like method of feeding. It lived on life-force, as well as I could understand, draining the vital powers of a mammal vampirically. And it assumed the shape of its prey as it fed. It was not possession, in the strict sense of the word. It was a sort of merging....</p>
   <p>Humanity is inclined to invest all things with its own attributes, forgetting that outside the limitations of time and space and size, familiar laws of nature do not apply.</p>
   <p>So, even now I do not know all that lay behind the terror in that Peruvian valley. This much I learned: the Other, like Lhar and her robot, had been cast adrift by a time-slip, and thus marooned here. There was no way for it to return to its normal Time-sector. It had created the fog-wall to protect itself from the direct rays of the sun, which threatened its existence.</p>
   <p>Sitting there in the filigreed, silver twilight beside Lhar, I had a concept of teeming universes of space-time, of an immense spiral of lives and civilizations, races and cultures, covering an infinite cosmos. And yet--what had happened? Very little, in that inconceivable infinity. A rift in time, a dimensional slip--and a sector of land and three beings on it had been wrenched from their place in time and transported to our time-stratum.</p>
   <p>A robot, a flower that was alive and intelligent--and feminine--and the Other....</p>
   <p>"The native girls," I said. "What will happen to them?"</p>
   <p>"They are no longer alive," Lhar told me. "They still move and breathe, but they are dead, sustained only by the life-force of the Other. I do not think it will harm me. Apparently it prefers other food."</p>
   <p>"That's why you've stayed here?" I asked.</p>
   <p>The shining velvety calyx swayed. "I shall die soon. For a little while I thought that I might manage to survive in this alien world, this alien time. Your blood has helped." The cool tentacle withdrew from my arm. "But I lived in a younger time, where space was filled with--with certain energizing vibratory principles.</p>
   <p>"They have faded now almost to nothing, to what you call cosmic rays. And these are too weak to maintain my life. No, I must die. And then my poor robot will be alone." I sensed elfin amusement in that last thought. "It seems absurd to you that I should think affectionately of a machine. But in our world there is a rapport--a mental symbiosis--between robot and living beings."</p>
   <p>There was a silence. After a while I said, "I'd better get out of here. Get help--to end the menace of the other...." What sort of help I did not know. Was the Other vulnerable?</p>
   <p>Lhar caught my thought. "In its own shape it is vulnerable, but what that shape is I do not know. As for your escaping from this valley--you cannot. The fog will bring you back."</p>
   <p>"I've got my compass." I glanced at it, saw that the needle was spinning at random.</p>
   <p>Lhar said: "The Other has many powers. Whenever you go into the fog, you will always return here."</p>
   <p>"How do you know all this?" I asked.</p>
   <p>"My robot tells me. A machine can reason logically, better than a colloid brain."</p>
   <p>I closed my eyes, trying to think. Surely it should not be difficult for me to retrace my steps, to find a path out of this valley. Yet I hesitated, feeling a strange impotence.</p>
   <p>"Can't your robot guide me?" I persisted.</p>
   <p>"He will not leave my side. Perhaps--" Lhar turned to the sphere, and the cilia fluttered excitedly. "No," she said, turning back to me. "Built into his mind is one rule--never to leave me. He cannot disobey that."</p>
   <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
   <p>I couldn't ask Lhar to go with me. Somehow I sensed that the frigid cold of the surrounding mountains would destroy her swiftly. I said, "It must be possible for me to get out of here. I'm going to try, anyway."</p>
   <p>"I will be waiting," she said, and did not move as I slipped out between two trunks of the banyan-like tree.</p>
   <p>It was daylight and the silvery grayness overhead was palely luminous. I headed for the nearest rampart of fog.</p>
   <p>Lhar was right. Each time I went into that cloudy fog barrier I was blinded. I crept forward step by step, glancing behind me at my footprints in the snow, trying to keep in a straight line. And presently I would find myself back in the valley....</p>
   <p>I must have tried a dozen times before giving up. There were no landmarks in that all-concealing grayness, and only by sheerest chance would anyone blunder into this valley--unless hypnotically summoned, like the Indio girls.</p>
   <p>I realized that I was trapped. Finally I went back to Lhar. She hadn't moved an inch since I had left, nor had the robot, apparently.</p>
   <p>"Lhar," I said. "Lhar, can't you help me?"</p>
   <p>The white flame of the flower was motionless, but the robot's cilia moved in quick signals. Lhar moved at last.</p>
   <p>"Perhaps," her thought came. "Unless both induction and deduction fail, my robot has discovered a chance for you. The Other can control your mind through emotions. But I, too, have some power over your mind. If I give you strength, wall you with a psychic shield against intrusion, you may be able to face the Other. But you cannot destroy it unless it is in its normal shape. The Indio girls must be killed first...."</p>
   <p>"Killed?" I felt a sense of horror at the thought of killing those poor simple native girls.</p>
   <p>"They are not actually alive now. They are now a part of the Other. They can never be restored to their former life."</p>
   <p>"How will--destroying them--help me?" I asked.</p>
   <p>Again Lhar consulted the robot. "The Other will be driven from their bodies. It will then have no hiding-place and must resume its own form. Then it can be slain."</p>
   <p>Lhar swayed and curtseyed away. "Come," she said. "It is in my mind that the Other must die. It is evil, ruthlessly selfish, which is the same thing. Until now I have not realized the solution to this evil being. But seeing into your thoughts has clarified my own. And my robot tells me that unless I aid you, the Other will continue ravening into your world. If that happens, the time-pattern will be broken.... I do not quite understand, but my robot makes no mistakes. The Other must die...."</p>
   <p>She was outside of the banyan now, the sphere gliding after her. I followed. The three of us moved swiftly across the blue moss, guided by the robot.</p>
   <p>In a little while we came to where the six Indio girls were squatting. They had apparently not moved since I had left them.</p>
   <p>"The Other is not here," Lhar said.</p>
   <p>The robot held me back as Lhar advanced toward the girls, the skirt-like frill at her base convoluting as she moved. She paused beside them and her petals trembled and began to unfold.</p>
   <p>From the tip of that great blossom a fountain of white dust spurted up. Spores or pollen, it seemed to be. The air was cloudy with the whiteness.</p>
   <p>The robot drew me back, back again. I sensed danger....</p>
   <p>The pollen seemed to be drawn toward the Indios, spun toward them in dancing mist-motes. It settled on their bronzed bodies, their limbs and faces. It covered them like a veil until they appeared to be six statues, white as cold marble, there on the blue moss.</p>
   <p>Lhar's petals lifted and closed again. She swayed toward me, her mind sending a message into mine.</p>
   <p>"The Other has no refuge now," she told me. "I have slain the--the girls."</p>
   <p>"They're dead?" My lips were dry.</p>
   <p>"What semblance of life they had left is now gone. The Other cannot use them again."</p>
   <p>Lhar swayed toward me. A cool tentacle swept out, pressing lightly on my forehead. Another touched my breast, above the heart.</p>
   <p>"I give you of my strength," Lhar said. "It will be as shield and buckler to you. The rest of the way you must go alone...."</p>
   <p>Into me tide of power flowed. I sank into cool depths, passionless and calm. Something was entering my body, my mind and soul, drowning my fears, stiffening my resolve.</p>
   <p>Strength of Lhar was now my strength!</p>
   <p>The tentacles dropped away, their work done. The robot's cilia signalled and Lhar said, "Your way lies there. That temple--do you see it?"</p>
   <p>I saw it. Far in the distance, half shrouded by the fog, a scarlet structure, not ruined like the others, was visible.</p>
   <p>"You will find the Other there. Slay the last Indio, then destroy the Other."</p>
   <p>I had no doubt now of my ability to do that. A new power seemed to lift me from my feet, send me running across the moss. Once I glanced back, to see Lhar and her robot standing motionless, watching me.</p>
   <p>The temple enlarged as I came nearer. It was built of the same reddish stone as the other ruined blocks I had seen. But erosion had weathered its harsh angles till nothing now remained but a rounded, smoothly sculptured monolith, twenty feet tall, shaped like a rifle shell.</p>
   <p>A doorway gaped in the crimson wall. I paused for a moment on the threshold. In the dimness within a shadow stirred. I stepped forward, finding myself in a room that was tall and narrow, the ceiling hidden in gloom. Along the walls were carvings I could not clearly see. They gave a suggestion of inhuman beings that watched.</p>
   <p>It was dark but I could see the Indio girl who had been Miranda Valle. Her eyes were on me, and, even through the protecting armor of Lhar strength; I could feel their terrible power.</p>
   <p>The life in the girl was certainly not human!</p>
   <p>"Destroy her!" my mind warned. "Destroy her! Quickly!"</p>
   <p>But as I hesitated a veil of darkness seemed to fall upon me. Utter cold, a frigidity as of outer space, lanced into my brain. My senses reeled under the assault. Desperately, blind and sick and giddy, I called on the reserve strength Lhar had given me. Then I blacked out....</p>
   <p>When I awoke I saw smoke coiling up from the muzzle of the pistol in my hand. At my feet lay the Indio girl, dead. My bullet had crashed into her brain, driving out the terrible dweller there.</p>
   <p>My eyes were drawn to the farther wall. An archway gaped there. I walked across the room, passed under the archway. Instantly I was in complete, stygian darkness. But I was not alone!</p>
   <p>The power of the Other struck me like a tangible blow. I have no words to tell of an experience so completely disassociated from human memories. I remember only this: my mind and soul were sucked down into a black abyss where I had no volition or consciousness. It was another dimension of the mind where my senses were altered....</p>
   <p>Nothing existed there but the intense blackness beyond time and space. I could not see the Other nor conceive of it. It was pure intelligence, stripped of flesh. It was alive and it had power--power that was god-like.</p>
   <p>There in the great darkness I stood alone, unaided, sensing the approach of an entity from some horribly remote place where all values were altered.</p>
   <p>I sensed Lhar's nearness. "Hurry!" her thought came to me. "Before it wakens!"</p>
   <p>Warmth flowed into me. The blackness receded....</p>
   <p>Against the farther wall something lay, a thing bafflingly human.... a great-headed thing with a tiny pallid body coiled beneath it. It was squirming toward me....</p>
   <p>"Destroy it!" Lhar communicated.</p>
   <p>The pistol in my hand thundered, bucking against my palm. Echoes roared against the walls. I fired and fired again until the gun was empty....</p>
   <p>"It is dead," Lhar's thought entered my mind.</p>
   <p>I stumbled, dropped the pistol.</p>
   <p>"It was the child of an old super-race--a child not yet born."</p>
   <p>Can you conceive of such a race? Where even the unborn had power beyond human understanding? My mind wondered what the adult Alien must be.</p>
   <p>I shivered, suddenly cold. An icy wind gusted through the temple. Lhar's thought was clear in my mind.</p>
   <p>"Now the valley is no longer a barrier to the elements. The Other created fog and warmth to protect itself. Now it is dead and your world reclaims its own."</p>
   <p>From the outer door of the temple I could see the fog being driven away by a swift wind. Snow was falling slowly, great white flakes that blanketed the blue moss and lay like caps on the red shards that dotted the valley.</p>
   <p>"I shall die swiftly and easily now, instead of slowly, by starvation," Lhar said.</p>
   <p>A moment later a thought crossed my mind, faint and intangible as a snowflake and I knew Lhar was saying goodbye.</p>
   <p>I left the valley. Once I looked back, but there was only a veil of snow behind me.</p>
   <p>And out of the greatest adventure the cosmic gods ever conceived--only this: For a little while the eternal veil of time was ripped away and the door to the unknown was held ajar.</p>
   <p>But now the door is closed once more. Below Huascan a robot guards a tomb, that is all.</p>
   <p>The snow fell faster. Shivering, I ploughed through the deepening drifts. My compass needle pointed north. The spell that had enthralled the valley was gone.</p>
   <p>Half an hour later I found the trail, and the road to safety lay open before me. Fra Rafael would be waiting to hear my story.</p>
   <p>But I did not think that he would believe it....</p>

    <p>THE SECRET OF KRALITZ</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>I awoke from profound sleep to find two black-swathed forms standing silently beside me, their faces pale blurs in the gloom. As I blinked to clear my sleep-dimmed eyes, one of them beckoned impatiently, and suddenly I realized the purpose of this midnight summons. For years I had been expecting it, ever since my father, the Baron Kralitz, had revealed to me the secret and the curse that hung over our ancient house. And so, without a word, I rose and followed my guides as they led me along the gloomy corridors of the castle that had been my home since birth.</p>
   <p>As I proceeded there rose up in my mind the stern face of my father, and in my ears rang his solemn words as he told me of the legendary curse of the House of Kralitz, the unknown secret that was imparted to the eldest son of each generation--at a certain time.</p>
   <p>"When?" I had asked my father as he lay on his death-bed, fighting back the approach of dissolution.</p>
   <p>"When you are able to understand," he had told me, watching my face intently from beneath his tufted white brows. "Some are told the secret sooner than others. Since the first Baron Kralitz the secret has been handed down----"</p>
   <p>He clutched at his breast and paused. It was fully five minutes before he had gathered his strength to speak again in his rolling, powerful voice. No gasping, death-bed confessions for the Baron Kralitz!</p>
   <p>He said at last, "You have seen the ruins of the old monastery near the village, Franz. The first Baron burnt it and put the monks to the sword. The Abbot interfered too often with the Baron's whims. A girl sought shelter and the Abbot refused to give her up at the Baron's demand. His patience was at an end--you know the tales they still tell about him.</p>
   <p>"He slew the Abbot, burned the monastery, and took the girl. Before he died the Abbot cursed his slayer, and cursed his sons for unborn generations. And it is the nature of this curse that is the secret of our house.</p>
   <p>"I may not tell you what the curse is. Do not seek to discover it before it is revealed to you. Wait patiently, and in due time you will be taken by the warders of the secret down the stairway to the underground cavern. And then you will learn the secret of Kralitz."</p>
   <p>As the last word passed my father's lips he died, his stern face still set in its harsh lines.</p>
   <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
   <p>Deep in my memories, I had not noticed our path, but now the dark forms of my guides paused beside a gap in the stone flagging, where a stairway which I had never seen during my wanderings about the castle led into subterranean depths. Down this stairway I was conducted, and presently I came to realize that there was light of a sort--a dim, phosphorescent radiance that came from no recognizable source, and seemed to be less actual light than the accustoming of my eyes to the near-darkness.</p>
   <p>I went down for a long time. The stairway turned and twisted in the rock, and the bobbing forms ahead were my only relief from the monotony of the interminable descent. And at last, deep underground, the long stairway ended, and I gazed over the shoulders of my guides at the great door that barred my path. It was roughly chiseled from the solid stone, and upon it were curious and strangely disquieting carvings, symbols which I did not recognize. It swung open, and I passed through and paused, staring about me through a gray sea of mist.</p>
   <p>I stood upon a gentle slope that fell away into the fog-hidden distance, from which came a pandemonium of muffled bellowing and high-pitched, shrill squeakings vaguely akin to obscene laughter. Dark, half-glimpsed shapes swam into sight through the haze and disappeared again, and great vague shadows swept overhead on silent wings. Almost beside me was a long rectangular table of stone, and at this table two score of men were seated, watching me from eyes that gleamed dully out of deep sockets. My two guides silently took their places among them.</p>
   <p>And suddenly the thick fog began to lift. It was swept raggedly away on the breath of a chill wind. The far dim reaches of the cavern were revealed as the mist swiftly dissipated, and I stood silent in the grip of a mighty fear, and, strangely, an equally potent, unaccountable thrill of delight. A part of my mind seemed to ask, "What horror is this?" And another part whispered, "You know this place!"</p>
   <p>But I could never have seen it before. If I had realized what lay far beneath the castle I could never have slept at night for the fear that would have obsessed me. For, standing silent with conflicting tides of horror and ecstasy racing through me, I saw the weird inhabitants of the underground world.</p>
   <p>Demons, monsters, unnamable things! Nightmare colossi strode bellowing through the murk, and amorphous gray things like giant slugs walked upright on stumpy legs. Creatures of shapeless soft pulp, beings with flame-shot eyes scattered over their misshapen bodies like fabled Argus, writhed and twisted there in the evil glow. Winged things that were not bats swooped and fluttered in the tenebrous air, whispering sibilantly--whispering in human voices.</p>
   <p>Far away at the bottom of the slope I could see the chill gleam of water, a hidden, sunless sea. Shapes mercifully almost hidden by distance and the semi-darkness sported and cried, troubling the surface of the lake, the size of which I could only conjecture. And a flapping thing whose leathery wings stretched like a tent above my head swooped and hovered for a moment, staring with flaming eyes, and then darted off and was lost in the gloom.</p>
   <p>And all the while, as I shuddered with fear and loathing, within me was this evil glee--this voice which whispered, "You know this place! You belong here! Is it not good to be home?"</p>
   <p>I glanced behind me. The great door had swung silently shut, and escape was impossible. And then pride came to my aid. I was a Kralitz. And a Kralitz would not acknowledge fear in the face of the devil himself!</p>
   <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
   <p>I stepped forward and confronted the warders, who were still seated regarding me intently from eyes in which a smoldering fire seemed to burn. Fighting down an insane dread that I might find before me an array of fleshless skeletons, I stepped to the head of the table, where there was a sort of crude throne, and peered closely at the silent figure on my right.</p>
   <p>It was no bare skull at which I gazed, but a bearded, deadly-pale face. The curved, voluptuous lips were crimson, looking almost rouged, and the dull eyes stared through me bleakly. Inhuman agony had etched itself in deep lines on the white face, and gnawing anguish smoldered in the sunken eyes. I cannot hope to convey the utter strangeness, the atmosphere of unearthliness that surrounded him, almost as palpable as the fetid tomb-stench that welled from his dark garments. He waved a black-swathed arm to the vacant seat at the head of the table, and I sat down.</p>
   <p>This nightmare sense of unreality! I seemed to be in a dream, with a hidden part of my mind slowly waking from sleep into evil life to take command of my faculties. The table was set with old-fashioned goblets and trenchers such as had not been used for hundreds of years. There was meat on the trenchers, and red liquor in the jeweled goblets. A heady, overpowering fragrance swam up into my nostrils, mixed with the grave-smell of my companions and the musty odor of a dank and sunless place.</p>
   <p>Every white face was turned to me, faces that seemed oddly familiar, although I did not know why. Each face was alike in its blood-red, sensual lips and its expression of gnawing agony, and burning black eyes like the abysmal pits of Tartarus stared at me until I felt the short hairs stir on my neck. But--I was a Kralitz! I stood up and said boldly in archaic German that somehow came familiarly from my lips, "I am Franz, twenty-first Baron Kralitz. What do you want with me?"</p>
   <p>A murmur of approval went around the long table. There was a stir. From the foot of the board a huge bearded man arose, a man with a frightful scar that made the left side of his face a horror of healed white tissue. Again the odd thrill of familiarity ran through me; I had seen that face before, and vaguely I remembered looking at it through dim twilight.</p>
   <p>The man spoke in the old guttural German. "We greet you, Franz, Baron Kralitz. We greet you and pledge you, Franz--and we pledge the House of Kralitz!"</p>
   <p>With that he caught up the goblet before him and held it high. All along the long table the black-swathed ones arose, and each held high his jeweled cup, and pledged me. They drank deeply, savoring the liquor, and I made the bow custom demanded. I said, in words that sprang almost unbidden from my mouth:</p>
   <p>"I greet you, who are the warders of the secret of Kralitz, and I pledge you in return."</p>
   <p>All about me, to the farthermost reaches of the dim cavern, a hush fell, and the bellows and howlings, and the insane tittering of the flying things, were no longer heard. My companions leaned expectantly toward me. Standing alone at the head of the board, I raised my goblet and drank. The liquor was heady, exhilarating, with a faintly brackish flavor.</p>
   <p>And abruptly I knew why the pain-racked, ruined face of my companion had seemed familiar; I had seen it often among the portraits of my ancestors, the frowning, disfigured visage of the founder of the House of Kralitz that glared down from the gloom of the great hall. In that fierce white light of revelation I knew my companions for what they were; I recognized them, one by one, remembering their canvas counterparts. But there was a change! Like an impalpable veil, the stamp of ineradicable evil lay on the tortured faces of my hosts, strangely altering their features, so that I could not always be sure I recognized them. One pale, sardonic face reminded me of my father, but I could not be sure, so monstrously altered was its expression.</p>
   <p>I was dining with my ancestors--the House of Kralitz!</p>
   <p>My cup was still held high, and I drained it, for somehow the grim revelation was not entirely unexpected. A strange glow thrilled through my veins, and I laughed aloud for the evil delight that was in me. The others laughed too, a deep-throated merriment like the barking of wolves--tortured laughter from men stretched on the rack, mad laughter in hell! And all through the hazy cavern came the clamor of the devil's brood! Great figures that towered many spans high rocked with thundering glee, and the flying things tittered slyly overhead. And out over the vast expanse swept the wave of frightful mirth, until the half-seen things in the black waters sent out bellows that tore at my eardrums, and the unseen roof far overhead sent back roaring echoes of the clamor.</p>
   <p>And I laughed with them, laughed insanely, until I dropped exhausted into my seat and watched the scarred man at the other end of the table as he spoke.</p>
   <p>"You are worthy to be of our company, and worthy to eat at the same board. We have pledged each other, and you are one of us; we shall eat together."</p>
   <p>And we fell to, tearing like hungry beasts at the succulent white meat in the jeweled trenchers. Strange monsters served us, and at a chill touch on my arm I turned to find a dreadful crimson thing, like a skinned child, refilling my goblet. Strange, strange and utterly blasphemous was our feast. We shouted and laughed and fed there in the hazy light, while all around us thundered the evil horde. There was hell beneath Castle Kralitz, and it held high carnival this night.</p>
   <subtitle>* * * * *</subtitle>
   <p>Presently we sang a fierce drinking-song, swinging the deep cups back and forth in rhythm with our shouted chant. It was an archaic song, but the obsolete words were no handicap, for I mouthed them as though they had been learned at my mother's knee. And at the thought of my mother a trembling and a weakness ran through me abruptly, but I banished it with a draft of the heady liquor.</p>
   <p>Long, long we shouted and sang and caroused there in the great cavern, and after a time we arose together and trooped to where a narrow, high-arched bridge spanned the tenebrous waters of the lake. But I may not speak of what was at the other end of the bridge, nor of the unnamable things that I saw--and did! I learned of the fungoid, inhuman beings that dwell on far cold Yuggoth, of the cyclopean shapes that attend unsleeping Cthulhu in his submarine city, of the strange pleasures that the followers of leprous, subterranean Yog-Sothoth may possess, and I learned, too, of the unbelievable manner in which Iod, the Source, is worshipped beyond the outer galaxies. I plumbed the blackest pits of hell and came back--laughing. I was one with the rest of those dark warders, and I joined them in the saturnalia of horror until the scarred man spoke to us again.</p>
   <p>"Our time grows short," he said, his scarred and bearded white face like a gargoyle's in the half-light. "We must depart soon. But you are a true Kralitz, Franz, and we shall meet again, and feast again, and make merry for longer than you think. One last pledge!"</p>
   <p>I gave it to him. "To the House of Kralitz! May it never fall!"</p>
   <p>And with an exultant shout we drained the pungent dregs of the liquor.</p>
   <p>Then a strange lassitude fell upon me. With the others I turned my back on the cavern and the shapes that pranced and bellowed and crawled there, and I went up through the carved stone portal. We filed up the stairs, up and up, endlessly, until at last we emerged through the gaping hole in the stone flags and proceeded, a dark, silent company, back through those interminable corridors. The surroundings began to grow strangely familiar, and suddenly I recognized them.</p>
   <p>We were in the great burial vaults below the castle, where the Barons Kralitz were ceremoniously entombed. Each Baron had been placed in his stone casket in his separate chamber, and each chamber lay, like beads on a necklace, adjacent to the next, so that we proceeded from the farthermost tombs of the early Barons Kralitz toward the unoccupied vaults. By immemorial custom, each tomb lay bare, an empty mausoleum, until the time had come for its use, when the great stone coffin, with the memorial inscription carved upon it, would be carried to its place. It was fitting, indeed, for the secret of Kralitz to be hidden here.</p>
   <p>Abruptly I realized that I was alone, save for the bearded man with the disfiguring scar. The others had vanished, and, deep in my thoughts, I had not missed them. My companion stretched out his black-swathed arm and halted my progress, and I turned to him questioningly. He said in his sonorous voice, "I must leave you now. I must go back to my own place." And he pointed to the way whence we had come.</p>
   <p>I nodded, for I had already recognized my companions for what they were. I knew that each Baron Kralitz had been laid in his tomb, only to arise as a monstrous thing neither dead nor alive, to descend into the cavern below and take part in the evil saturnalia. I realized, too, that with the approach of dawn they had returned to their stone coffins, to lie in a death-like trance until the setting sun should bring brief liberation. My own occult studies had enabled me to recognize these dreadful manifestations.</p>
   <p>I bowed to my companion and would have proceeded on my way to the upper parts of the castle, but he barred my path. He shook his head slowly, his scar hideous in the phosphorescent gloom.</p>
   <p>I said, "May I not go yet?"</p>
   <p>He stared at me with tortured, smoldering eyes that had looked into hell itself, and he pointed to what lay beside me, and in a flash of nightmare realization I knew the secret of the curse of Kralitz. There came to me the knowledge that made my brain a frightful thing in which shapes of darkness would ever swirl and scream; the dreadful comprehension of when each Baron Kralitz was initiated into the brotherhood of blood. I knew--I knew--that no coffin had ever been placed unoccupied in the tombs, and I read upon the stone sarcophagus at my feet the inscription that made my doom known to me--my own name, "Franz, twenty-first Baron Kralitz."</p>
