   <p>The Four</p>
   <p>by Robert Silverberg</p>
  </title>
  <section>
   <p>More than a mile of dark sea-water roofed the city. It lay off the Atlantic coast of North America, nestling beneath the waves, cradled by hundreds of atmospheres of pressure. In the official records, the city’s designation was Undersea Refuge PL-12. But the official records, like the rest of the landside world, lay blasted and shattered, and the people of Undersea Refuge PL-12 called their city New Baltimore. Eleven thousand was New Baltimore’s population, a figure set by long-dead landside authorities and maintained by rigorous policies of control.</p>
   <p>The history of New Baltimore stretched back for one hundred thirteen years. Not one of its eleven thousand inhabitants had not been born in the deep, under the laminated dome that was the city’s shield. In the ninetieth year of New Baltimore a child had been allotted to the Foyle family, and Mary Foyle was born. And in the hundred thirteenth year of the city—</p>
   <p>Mary Foyle lay coiled like a fetal snake in her room at the New Baltimore Social Hall. She lay with feet drawn up, arms locked over her bosom, eyes closed, mouth slightly open. She was twenty-three, blonde, terrible in her wrath. She was not asleep.</p>
   <p>At the ninth hour of the day and the second of her three-hour Free Period, she sensed the approach of a visitor, and hatred gathered in her cold mind. Bitterly, she disengaged herself from what she had been doing, and extended a tendril of thought as far as the door. The mind she encountered was weak, pliable, amiable.</p>
   <p>Yes, she thought, Roger Carroll, the silly goose.</p>
   <p>Roger’s mind formed the thought, Mary, may I come in? and he verbalized as far as “Mary, may—” when she darted a hissing prong of thought at him, and he reddened, cut short his sentence and opened the door.</p>
   <p>Lazily Mary Foyle tidied her wrappings and looked up at Roger. He was thin, like all men of New Baltimore, but well muscled and strong. He was a year her junior; gifted like her, with the Powers, but weak of will and flabby of purpose.</p>
   <p>“You’ll destroy your Powers if you don’t give them free play,” she thought coldly at him.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry. It was a slip.”</p>
   <p>She glared bleakly. “Suppose I slipped and blasted your silly mind?”</p>
   <p>“Mary, I’ve never denied that you’re more powerful than I am—than all three of us put together—”</p>
   <p>“Quiet,” she ordered. “The others are coming. Try not to look so much like a blithering fool.”</p>
   <p>Her mind had detected the arrival of the other two members of their little group. Moments later Roger’s slower mind had received the signal, and he added his friendly welcome to Mary’s cold one.</p>
   <p>Michael Sharp entered first; after him, Tom Devers. They were in their late twenties. In them the Powers had ripened slowly, and Mary had found them out only two years before. Roger had been under her sway for nine years. She herself had first sensed the Powers stirring in her mind fifteen years earlier.</p>
   <p>There was a moment of blending as the four minds met— Mary’s as always, harshly dominant, never yielding for a moment the superiority that gave her the leadership of the group. The greeting was done with; the Four were as one, and the confines of the room seemed to shrink until it cradled their blended minds as securely as the Dome held back the sea from the buildings of New Baltimore.</p>
   <p>“Well?” Mary demanded. The challenge rang out and she sensed Roger’s involuntary flinch. “Well?” she asked again, deliberately more strident.</p>
   <p>Slowly, sadly, came the response: affirmative from Michael, affirmative from Tom, weakly affirmative from Roger. A slow smile spread over Mary’s face. Affirmative!</p>
   <p>Roger’s mind added hesitantly, “Of course, there’s grave danger—”</p>
   <p>“Danger adds spice.”</p>
   <p>“If we’re caught we’re finished—”</p>
   <p>Impetuously Mary extended her mind toward Roger’s, entered it, made slight adjustments in Roger’s endocrine balance. Currents of fear ceased to flow through his body. Trepidation died away.</p>
   <p>“All right,” Roger said, his mental voice a whisper now. “I agree to join you.”</p>
   <p>“All agreed, then,” Mary said. Her mind enfolded those of the three lean, pale men who faced her. The borders of the small room grew smaller yet, shrank to the size of Mary’s skull, then expanded outward.</p>
   <p>Four minds linked as one leaped five thousand feet skyward, toward the crisped and blackened land above.</p>
   <p>Mary alone could not have done it. She had tried, and much of her bitterness stemmed from the fact that she had failed. She had sent her mind questing out along the sea-bottom, rippling through the coraled ooze to New Chicago and New London and New Miami and the other domed cities that dotted the Atlantic floor. It was strictly illegal for a Sensitive to make contact with the mind of an inhabitant of another Dome, but Mary had never cared much for what the legal authorities said.</p>
   <p>She had reached the other cities of the sea-bottom easily enough—though the effort of getting to New London had left her sweat-soaked and panting—but breaking through to the surface eluded her. Time and again she sent shafts skyward, launching beams of thought through the thick blanket of water above, striving to pierce the ocean and see the land, the ruined land deserted and bare, the land made desolate by radiation. She wanted to see the sky in its blueness, and the golden terror of the naked sun.</p>
   <p>She failed. Less than a thousand feet from the surface the impulse sagged, the spear of thought blunted and fell back. In the privacy of her room she tried again, and yet again, until her thin clothes were pasted to her body by sweat.</p>
   <p>That was when she realized she would need help.</p>
   <p>It was a bitter realization. Slowly Mary had sought out those she needed, from the two hundred Sensitives of New Baltimore. Roger she had known for years, and he was as much under her domination as was her hand or her leg. But Roger was not enough. She found Michael and she found Tom, and when rapport had been established she showed them what she proposed to do.</p>
   <p>Using them as boosters, as amplifiers, she intended to hurl a psionic signal through the sea to the surface. She could not do it alone; in series, the four of them might do almost anything.</p>
   <p>They lay, the four of them, sprawled on couches in Mary’s room. With cold fury she whipped them together into the unit she needed. Michael had objected; after all, the penalty for projecting one’s mind beyond the borders of New Baltimore was death. But Mary had quashed that objection, welded the Four into One, cajoled and commanded and pleaded and manipulated.</p>
   <p>Now, tenuously, the threaded strand of four-ply thought wove toward the surface.</p>
   <p>Mary had seen the tridims projected on the arching screens in General Hall. She had an idea of what the surface was like, all blacks and browns and fused glass and gaunt frameworks that had been buildings. But she wanted to see it for herself. She wanted direct visual experience of this surface world, this dead skin of the planet, cauterized by man’s evil. Mary had a lively appreciation of evil.</p>
   <p>Upward they traveled. Mary sensed Michael and Tom and Roger clinging to her mind, helping her force the impulse upward. Eyes closed, body coiled, she hurled herself to the task.</p>
   <p>And the blackness of the water lightened to dark green as the sun-warmed zone approached. She had not got this far on her earlier, solo attempts. Now her mind rose with little effort into the upper regions of the sea, and without warning cleaved through the barrier of water into the open air.</p>
   <p>Michael and Tom and Roger were still with her.</p>
   <p>The sight of landside was dazzling.</p>
   <p>The first perception was of the sun; smaller than she had expected, but still an awesome object, glowing high in the metal-blue sky. White clouds lay fleecily under the sun.</p>
   <p>New Baltimore was some miles out at sea. Drifting lazily but yet with the near-instantaneous speed of thought, they moved landward, ready and eager to see the desolation and rum.</p>
   <p>The shock was overwhelming.</p>
   <p>Together, the Four drifted in from the sea, searching for the radiation-blackened fields, the dead land. Instead they saw delicate greenness, carpets of untrodden grass, vaulting thick trees heavy with fruit. Animals grazed peacefully in the lush fields. In the distance, glimmering in the sun, low sloping mountains decked in green rose slowly from the horizon.</p>
   <p>Birds sang. Wind whistled gently through the swaying trees. It was as if the hand of man had never approached this land.</p>
   <p>Can the scars have healed so soon? Mary wondered. Hardly a century since the bombings destroyed the surface; could the wounds have been covered so rapidly? In wonder she guided the multiple mind down through the warm sky to the ground.</p>
   <p>They came alight in a grassy field, sweet with the odor of springtime. Mary felt the tingle of awe. Beings were approaching, floating over the grass without crushing it—not the misshapen mutants some thought might have survived on the surface, but tall godlike beings, smiling their welcome.</p>
   <p>A surge of joy rippled through Mary and through her into her three comrades. It would not be hard to teleport their bodies up from the depths. They could live here, in this pleasant land, quitting the confines of New Baltimore. She extended the range of her perception. In every direction lay beauty and peace, and never a sign of the destruction that had been.</p>
   <p>Perhaps there was no war, she thought. The landside people sent our ancestors down into the depths and then hoaxed them.</p>
   <p>And for a hundred years we thought the surface was deadly, radiation-seared, unlivable!</p>
   <p>For the first time in her life Mary felt no rancor. Bitterness was impossible in this green world of landside. The sun warmed the fertile land, and all was well.</p>
   <p>All-Sudden constricting impulses tugged at the thread of thought by which the four dreamers held contact with land-side.</p>
   <p>“Mary, wake up! Come out of it.”</p>
   <p>She struggled, but not even the combined strength of the Four could resist. Inexorably she found herself being dragged away, back down into the depths, into New Baltimore, into wakefulness.</p>
   <p>She opened her eyes and sat up. On the other couches, Michael and Tom and Roger were groggily returning to awareness.</p>
   <p>The room was crowded. Six members of the New Baltimore Control Force stood by the door, glaring grimly at her.</p>
   <p>Mary tried to lash out, but she was outnumbered; they were six of the strongest Sensitives in New Baltimore, and the fierce grip they held on her mind was unbreakable.</p>
   <p>“By what right do you come in here?” she asked, using her voice.</p>
   <p>It was Norman Myrick of the Control Force who gave the reply: “Mary, we’ve been watching you for years. You’re under arrest on a charge of projecting beyond the boundaries of New Baltimore.”</p>
   <p>The trial was a farce.</p>
   <p>Henry Markell sat in judgment upon them, in the General Hall of the City of New Baltimore. Procedure was simple. Markell, a Sensitive, opened his mind to the accusing members of the Control Force long enough to receive the evidence against the Four.</p>
   <p>Then he offered Mary and her three satellites the chance to assert their innocence by opening their minds to him. Sullenly, Mary refused on behalf of the Four. She knew the case was hopeless. If she allowed Markell to peer, their guilt was proven. If she refused, it was an equally tacit admission of guilt. Either way, the penalty loomed. But Mary hoped to retain the integrity of her mind. She had a plan, and a mind-probe would ruin it.</p>
   <p>Decision was reached almost immediately after the trial had begun.</p>
   <p>Markell said, “I have examined the evidence presented by the Control Force. They have shown that you, Mary, have repeatedly violated our security by making contact with other Domes, and now have inveigled three other Sensitives into joining you for a still bolder attempt. Will you speak now, Mary?”</p>
   <p>“We have no defense.”</p>
   <p>Markell sighed. “You certainly must be aware that our position under the Dome is a vulnerable one. We can never know when the madness that destroyed landside"—Mary smiled knowingly, saying nothing—"will return. We must therefore discourage unofficial contact between Domes by the most severe measures possible. We must retain our position of isolation.</p>
   <p>“You, Mary, and your three confederates, have broken this law. The penalty is inevitable. Our borders are rigid here, our population fixed by inexorable boundaries. We cannot tolerate criminals here. The air and food you have consumed up to now is forfeit; four new individuals can be brought into being to replace you. I sentence you to death, you four. This evening you shall be conveyed to the West Aperture and cast through it into the sea.”</p>
   <p>Mary glared in icy hatred as she heard the death sentence pronounced. Around her, members of the Control Force maintained constant check on her powers, keeping her from loosing a possibly fatal bolt of mental force at the judge or at anyone else. She was straitjacketed. She had no alternative but to submit.</p>
   <p>But she had a plan.</p>
   <p>They were taken to the West Aperture—a circular sphinctered opening in the framework of the Dome, used only for the purpose of execution. An airlock the size of a man served as the barrier between the pressing tons of the sea and the safety of New Baltimore.</p>
   <p>The Four were placed in the airlock, one at a time.</p>
   <p>The airlock opened—once, twice, thrice, a fourth time. Mary felt the coolness first, Michael next, then Roger, then Tom. Instantly her mind sought theirs.</p>
   <p>“Listen to me! We can save ourselves yet!”</p>
   <p>“How? The pressure—”</p>
   <p>“Listen! We can link again; teleport ourselves to the surface. You’ve seen what it’s like up there. We can live there. Hurry, join with me!”</p>
   <p>“The surface,” Roger said. “We can’t—”</p>
   <p>“We can live there. Hurry!”</p>
   <p>Michael objected, “Teleportation takes enormous energy. The backwash will smash the Dome. A whole section of the city will be flooded!”</p>
   <p>“What do we care?” Mary demanded. “They condemned us to death, didn’t they? Well, I condemn them!”</p>
   <p>There was no more time for arguing. Their interchange had taken but a microsecond. They were beginning to drift; in moments, the pressure would kill.</p>
   <p>Mary made use of her superior Powers to gather the other three to her. Debating was impossible now. Ruthlessly she drew their minds into hers. She heard Roger’s faint protest, but swept it away. For the second time, the Four became One. Mary gathered strength for the giant leap, not even knowing if she could make it but not bothering to consider the possibility of failure now.</p>
   <p>Upward.</p>
   <p>The passage was instantaneous, as the four minds, linked in an exponential series, ripped upward through the boiling sea toward the surface. Toward the green, warm, fertile surface.</p>
   <p>Toward the blackened, seared, radiation-roasted surface.</p>
   <p>Mary had only an instant for surprise. The surface was not at all as her mind had viewed it. Congealed rivers of rock wound through the dark fields of ash. The sky hummed with radioactive particles. No life was visible.</p>
   <p>Mary dropped to her knees in the blistering ash still warm from the 11 fires of a century before. The heavy particles lanced through her body. How can this be? she wondered. We saw green lands.</p>
   <p>An impulse reached her from Roger, dying of radiation to her left:</p>
   <p>. . . fooled you, Mary. Superior to you in one power, anyway. Imaginative projection. I blanked out real image, substituted phony one. You couldn’t tell the difference, could you? Happy dying, Mary . . .</p>
   <p>She hissed her hatred and tried to reach him, to rip out his eyes with her nails, but strength failed her. She toppled face-forward, down against the terrible deadly soil of Mother Earth, and waited for the radiation death to overtake her.</p>
   <p>Hoaxed, she thought bitterly.</p>
   <p>Five thousand feet below, the angry sea, swollen and enraged by the passage of four humans upward through it, crashed against the West Aperture of the New Baltimore dome, crashed again, finally broke through and came raging in, an equal and opposite reaction. Above, Mary Foyle writhed in death-throes under a leaden sky.</p>
