   <p><strong>The Iron Star</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The alien ship came drifting up from behind the far side of the neutron star just as I was going on watch. It looked a little like a miniature neutron star itself -- a perfect sphere, metallic, dark. But neutron stars don't have six perky little outthrust legs, and the alien craft did.</p>
   <p>While I paused in front of the screen the alien floated diagonally upward, cutting a swath of darkness across the brilliantly starry sky like a fast-moving black hole. It even occulted the real black hole that lay thirty light-minutes away.</p>
   <p>I stared at the strange vessel, fascinated and annoyed, wishing I had never seen it, wishing it would softly and suddenly vanish away. This mission was sufficiently complicated already. We hadn't needed an alien ship to appear on the scene. For five days now we had circled the neutron star in seesaw orbit with the aliens, a hundred eighty degrees apart. They hadn't said anything to us and we didn't know how to say anything to them. I didn't feel good about that. I like things direct, succinct, known.</p>
   <p>Lina Sorabji, busy enhancing sonar transparencies over at our improvised archaeology station, looked up from her work and caught me scowling. Lina is a slender, dark woman from Madras whose ancestors were priests and scholars when mine were hunting bison on the Great Plains. She said, "You shouldn't let it get to you like that, Tom."</p>
   <p>"You know what it feels like, every time I see it cross the screen? It's like having a little speck wandering around on the visual field of your eye. Irritating, frustrating, maddening -- and absolutely impossible to get rid of."</p>
   <p>"You want to get rid of it?"</p>
   <p>I shrugged. "Isn't this job tough enough? Attempting to scoop a sample from the core of a neutron star? Do we really have to have an alien spaceship looking over our shoulders while we work?"</p>
   <p>"Maybe it's not a spaceship at all," Lina said cheerily. "Maybe it's just some kind of giant spacebug. "</p>
   <p>I suppose she was trying to amuse me. I wasn't amused. This was going to win me a place in the history of space exploration, sure: Chief Executive Officer of the first expedition from Earth ever to encounter intelligent extraterrestrial life. Terrific. But that wasn't what IBM/Toshiba had hired me to do. And I'm more interested in completing assignments than in making history. You don't get paid for making history.</p>
   <p>Basically the aliens were a distraction from our real work, just as last month's discovery of a dead civilization on a nearby solar system had been, the one whose photographs Lina Sorabii now was studying. This was supposed to be a business venture involving the experimental use of new technology, not an archaeological mission or an exercise in interspecies diplomacy. And I knew that there was a ship from the Exxon/Hyundai combine loose somewhere in hyperspace right now working on the same task we'd been sent out to handle. If they brought it off first, IBM/Toshiba would suffer a very severe loss of face, which is considered very bad on the corporate level. What's bad for IBM/Toshiba would be exceedingly bad for me. For all of us.</p>
   <p>I glowered at the screen. Then the orbit of the <emphasis>Ben-wah Maru</emphasis> carried us down and away, and the alien disappeared from my line of sight. But not for long, I knew.</p>
   <p>As I keyed up the log reports from my sleep period I said to Lina, "You have anything new today?" She had spent the past three weeks analyzing the dead-world data. You never know what the parent companies will see as potentially profitable.</p>
   <p>"I'm down to hundred-meter penetration now. There's a system of broad tunnels wormholing the entire planet. Some kind of pneumatic transportation network, is my guess. Here, have a look."</p>
   <p>A holoprint sprang into vivid life in the air between us. It was a sonar scan that we had taken from ten thousand kilometers out, reaching a short distance below the surface of the dead world. I saw odd-angled tunnels lined with gleaming luminescent tiles that still pulsed with dazzling colors, centuries after the cataclysm that had destroyed all life there. Amazing decorative patterns of bright lines were plainly visible along the tunnel walls, lines that swirled and overlapped and entwined and beckoned my eye into some adjoining dimension.</p>
   <p>Trains of sleek snub-nosed vehicles were scattered like caterpillars everywhere in the tunnels. In them and around them lay skeletons, thousands of them, millions, a whole continent full of commuters slaughtered as they waited at the station for the morning express. Lina touched the fine scan and gave me a close look: biped creatures, broad skulls tapering sharply at the sides, long apelike arms, seven-fingered hands with what seemed like an opposable thumb at each end, pelvises enlarged into peculiar bony crests jutting far out from their hips. It wasn't the first time a hyperspace exploring vessel had come across relics of extinct extraterrestrial races, even a fossil or two. But these weren't fossils. These beings had died only a few hundred years ago. And they had all died at the same time.</p>
   <p>I shook my head somberly. "Those are some tunnels. They might have been able to convert them into pretty fair radiation shelters, is my guess. If only they'd had a little warning of what was coming."</p>
   <p>"They never knew what hit them."</p>
   <p>"No," I said. "They never knew a thing. A supernova brewing right next door and they must not have been able to tell what was getting ready to happen."</p>
   <p>Lina called up another print, and another, then another. During our brief flyby last month our sensors had captured an amazing panoramic view of this magnificent lost civilization: wide streets, spacious parks, splendid public buildings, imposing private houses, the works. Bizarre architecture, all unlikely angles and jutting crests like its creators, but unquestionably grand, noble, impressive. There had been keen intelligence at work here, and high artistry. Everything was intact and in a remarkable state of preservation, if you make allowances for the natural inroads that time and weather and I suppose the occasional earthquake will bring over three or four hundred years. Obviously this had been a wealthy, powerful society, stable and confident.</p>
   <p>And between one instant and the next it had all been stopped dead in its tracks, wiped out, extinguished, annihilated. Perhaps they had had a fraction of a second to realize that the end of the world had come, but no more than that. I saw what surely were family groups huddling together, skeletons clumped in threes or fours or fives. I saw what I took to be couples with their seven-fingered hands still clasped in a final exchange of love. I saw some kneeling in a weird elbows-down position that might have been one of -- who can say? Prayer? Despair? Acceptance?</p>
   <p>A sun had exploded and this great world had died. I shuddered, not for the first time, thinking of it.</p>
   <p>It hadn't even been their own sun. What had blown up was this one, forty light-years away from them, the one that was now the neutron star about which we orbited and that once had been a main sequence sun maybe three or four times as big as Earth's. Or else it had been the other one in this binary system, thirty light-minutes from the first, the giant blazing young companion star of which nothing remained except the black hole nearby. At the moment we had no way of knowing which of these two stars had gone supernova first. Whichever one it was, though, had sent a furious burst of radiation heading outward, a lethal flux of cosmic rays capable of destroying most or perhaps all life-forms within a sphere a hundred light-years in diameter.</p>
   <p>The planet of the underground tunnels and the noble temples had simply been in the way. One of these two suns had come to the moment when all the fuel in its core had been consumed: hydrogen had been fused into helium, helium into carbon, carbon into neon, oxygen, sulfur, silicon, until at last a core of pure iron lay at its heart. There is no atomic nucleus more strongly bound than iron. The star had reached the point where its release of energy through fusion had to cease; and with the end of energy production the star no longer could withstand the gravitational pressure of its own vast mass. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the core underwent a catastrophic collapse. Its matter was compressed -- beyond the point of equilibrium. And rebounded. And sent forth an intense shock wave that went rushing through the star's outer layers at a speed of 15,000 kilometers a second.</p>
   <p>Which ripped the fabric of the star apart, generating an explosion releasing more energy than a billion suns.</p>
   <p>The shock wave would have continued outward and outward across space, carrying debris from the exploded star with it, and interstellar gas that the debris had swept up. A fierce sleet of radiation would have been riding on that wave, too: cosmic rays, X rays, radio waves, gamma rays, everything, all up and down the spectrum. If the sun that had gone supernova had had planets close by, they would have been vaporized immediately. Outlying worlds of that system might merely have been fried.</p>
   <p>The people of the world of the tunnels, forty light-years distant, must have known nothing of the great explosion for a full generation after it had happened. But, all that while, the light of that shattered star was traveling toward them at a speed of 300,000 kilometers per second, and one night its frightful, baleful unexpected glare must have burst suddenly into their sky in the most terrifying way. And almost in that same moment -- for the deadly cosmic rays thrown off by the explosion move nearly at the speed of light -- the killing blast of hard radiation would have arrived. And so these people and all else that lived on their world perished in terror and light.</p>
   <p>All this took place a thousand light-years from Earth: that surging burst of radiation will need another six centuries to complete its journey toward our home world. At that distance, the cosmic rays will do us little or no harm. But for a time that long-dead star will shine in our skies so brilliantly that it will be visible by day, and by night it will cast deep shadows, longer than those of the Moon.</p>
   <p>That's still in Earth's future. Here the fatal supernova, and the second one that must have happened not long afterward, were some four hundred years in the past. What we had here now was a neutron star left over from one cataclysm and a black hole left over from the other. Plus the pathetic remains of a great civilization on a scorched planet orbiting a neighboring star. And now a ship from some alien culture. A busy corner of the galaxy, this one. A busy time for the crew of the IBM/Toshiba hyperspace ship <emphasis>Ben-wah Maru</emphasis>.</p>
   <subtitle>* * * *</subtitle>
   <p>I was still going over the reports that had piled up at my station during my sleep period -- mass-and-output readings on the neutron star, progress bulletins on the setup procedures for the neutronium scoop, and other routine stuff of that nature -- when the communicator cone in front of me started to glow. I flipped it on. Cal Biomsen, our communications guru, was calling from Brain Central downstairs.</p>
   <p>Bjornsen is mostly black African with some Viking genes salted in. The whole left side of his face is cyborg, the result of some extreme bit of teenage carelessness. The story is that he was gravity-vaulting and lost polarity at sixty meters. The mix of ebony skin, blue eyes, blond hair, and sculpted titanium is an odd one, but I've seen a lot of faces less friendly than Cal's. He's a good man with anything electronic.</p>
   <p>He said, "I think they're finally trying to send us messages, Tom."</p>
   <p>I sat up fast. "What's that?"</p>
   <p>"We've been pulling in signals of some sort for the past ninety minutes that didn't look random, but we weren't sure about it. A dozen or so different frequencies all up and down the line, mostly in the radio band, but we're also getting what seem to be infrared pulses, and something flashing in the ultraviolet range. A kind of scattershot noise effect, only it isn't noise."</p>
   <p>"Are you sure of that?"</p>
   <p>"The computer's still chewing on it," Biornsen said. The fingers of his right hand glided nervously up and down his smooth metal cheek. "But we can see already that there are clumps of repetitive patterns."</p>
   <p>"Coming from them? How do you know?"</p>
   <p>"We didn't, at first. But the transmissions conked out when we lost line-of- sight with them, and started up again when they came back into view."</p>
   <p>"I'll be right down," I said.</p>
   <p>Bjornsen is normally a calm man, but he was running in frantic circles when I reached Brain Central three or four minutes later. There was stuff dancing on all the walls: sine waves, mainly, but plenty of other patterns jumping around on the monitors. He had already pulled in specialists from practically every department -- the whole astronomy staff, two of the math guys, a couple from the external maintenance team, and somebody from engines. I felt preempted. Who was CEO on this ship, anyway? They were all babbling at once. "Fourier series," someone said, and someone yelled back, "Dirichiet factor," and someone else said, "Gibbs phenomenon!" I heard Angie Seraphin insisting vehemently, " -- continuous except possibly for a finite number of finite discontinuities in the interval negative pi to pi -- "</p>
   <p>"Hold it," I said. "What's going on?"</p>
   <p>More babble, more gibberish. I got them quiet again and repeated my question, aiming it this time at Biornsen.</p>
   <p>"We have the analysis now," he said.</p>
   <p>"So?"</p>
   <p>"You understand that its only guesswork, but Brain Central gives good guess. The way it looks, they seem to want us to broadcast a carrier wave they can tune in on, and just talk to them while they lock in with some sort of word-to-word translating device of theirs."</p>
   <p>"That's what Brain Central thinks they're saying?"</p>
   <p>"Its the most plausible semantic content of the patterns they're transmitting," Biornsen answered.</p>
   <p>I felt a chill. The aliens had word-to-word translating devices? That was a lot more than we could claim. Brain Central is one very smart computer, and if it thought that it had correctly deciphered the message coming in, then in all likelihood it had. An astonishing accomplishment, taking a bunch of ones and zeros put together by an alien mind and culling some sense out of them.</p>
   <p>But even Brain Central wasn't capable of word-to-word translation out of some unknown language. Nothing in our technology is. The alien message had been <emphasis>designed</emphasis> to be easy: put together, most likely, in a careful high-redundancy manner, the computer equivalent of picture-writing. Any race able to undertake interstellar travel ought to have a computer powerful enough to sweat the essential meaning out of a message like that, and we did. We couldn't go farther than that, though. Let the entropy of that message -- that is, the unexpectedness of it, the unpredictability of its semantic content -- rise just a little beyond the picture-writing level, and Brain Central would be lost. A computer that knows French should be able to puzzle out Spanish, and maybe even Greek. But Chinese? A tough proposition. And an <emphasis>alien</emphasis> language? Languages may start out logical, but they don't stay that way. And when its underlying grammatical assumptions were put together in the first place by beings with nervous systems that were wired up in ways entirely different from our own, well, the notion of instantaneous decoding becomes hopeless.</p>
   <p>Yet our computer said that their computer could do word-to-word. That was scary.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, if we couldn't talk to them, we couldn't begin to find out what they were doing here and what threat, if any, they might pose to us. By revealing our language to them we might be handing them some sort of advantage, but I couldn't be sure of that, and it seemed to me we had to take the risk.</p>
   <p>It struck me as a good idea to get some backing for that decision, though. After a dozen years as CEO aboard various corporate ships, I knew the protocols. You did what you thought was right, but you didn't go all the way out on the limb by yourself if you could help it.</p>
   <p>"Request a call for a meeting of the corporate staff," I told Biomsen.</p>
   <p>It wasn't so much a scientific matter now as a political one. The scientists would probably be gung-ho to go blasting straight ahead with making contact. But I wanted to hear what the Toshiba people would say, and the IBM people, and the military people. So we got everyone together and I laid the situation out and asked for a Consensus Process. And let them go at it, hammer and tongs.</p>
   <p>Instant polarization. The Toshiba people were scared silly of the aliens. We must be cautious, Nakamura said. Caution, yes, said her cohort Nagy-Szabo. There may be danger to Earth. We have no knowledge of the aims and motivations of these beings. Avoid all contact with them, Nagy-Szabo said. Nakamura went even further. We should withdraw from the area immediately, she said, and return to Earth for additional instructions. That drew hot opposition from Jorgensen and Kalliotis, the IBM people. We had work to do here, they said. We should do it. They grudgingly conceded the need to be wary, but strongly urged continuation of the mission and advocated a circumspect opening of contact with the other ship. I think they were already starting to think about alien marketing demographics. Maybe I do them an injustice. Maybe.</p>
   <p>The military people were about evenly divided between the two factions. A couple of them, the hair-splitting career-minded ones, wanted to play it absolutely safe and clear out of here fast, and the others, the up-and-away hero types, spoke out in favor of forging ahead with contact and to hell with the risks.</p>
   <p>I could see there wasn't going to be any consensus. It was going to come down to me to decide.</p>
   <p>By nature I am cautious. I might have voted with Nakamura in favor of immediate withdrawal; however, that would have made my ancient cold-eyed Sioux forebears howl. Yet in the end what swayed me was an argument that came from Bryce-Williamson, one of the fiercest of the military sorts. He said that we didn't dare turn tail and run for home without making contact, because the aliens would take that either as a hostile act or a stupid one, and either way they might just slap some kind of tracer on us that ultimately would enable them to discover the location of our home world. True caution, he said, required us to try to find out what these people were all about before we made any move to leave the scene. We couldn't just run and we couldn't simply ignore them.</p>
   <p>I sat quietly for a long time, weighing everything.</p>
   <p>"Well?" Bjornsen asked. "What do you want to do, Tom?"</p>
   <p>"Send them a broadcast," I said. "Give them greetings in the name of Earth and all its peoples. Extend to them the benevolent warm wishes of the board of directors of IBM/Toshiba. And then we'll wait and see."</p>
   <subtitle>* * * *</subtitle>
   <p>We waited. But for a long while we didn't see.</p>
   <p>Two days, and then some. We went round and round the neutron star, and they went round and round the neutron star, and no further communication came from them. We beamed them all sorts of messages at all sorts of frequencies along the spectrum, both in the radio band and via infrared and ultraviolet as well, so that they'd have plenty of material to work with. Perhaps their translator gadget wasn't all that good, I told myself hopefully. Perhaps it was stripping its gears trying to fathom the pleasant little packets of semantic data that we had sent them.</p>
   <p>On the third day of silence I began feeling restless. There was no way we could begin the work we had been sent here to do, not with aliens watching. The Toshiba people -- the Ultra Cautious faction -- got more and more nervous. Even the IBM representatives began to act a little twitchy. I started to question the wisdom of having overruled the advocates of a no-contact policy. Although the parent companies hadn't seriously expected us to run into aliens, they had covered that eventuality in our instructions, and we were under orders to do minimum tipping of our hands if we found ourselves observed by strangers. But it was too late to call back our messages, and I was still eager to find out what would happen next. So we watched and waited, and then we waited and watched. Round and round the neutron star.</p>
   <p>We had been parked in orbit for ten days now around the neutron star, an orbit calculated to bring us no closer to its surface than 9,000 kilometers at the closest skim. That was close enough for us to carry out our work, but not so close that we would be subjected to troublesome and dangerous tidal effects.</p>
   <p>The neutron star had been formed in the supernova explosion that had destroyed the smaller of the two suns in what had once been a binary star system here. At the moment of the cataclysmic collapse of the stellar sphere, all its matter had come rushing inward with such force that electrons and protons were driven into each other to become a soup of pure neutrons. Which then were squeezed so tightly that they were forced virtually into contact with one another, creating a smooth globe of the strange stuff that we call neutronium, a billion billion times denser than steel and a hundred billion billion times more incompressible.</p>
   <p>That tiny ball of neutronium glowing dimly in our screens was the neutron star. It was just 18 kilometers in diameter, but its mass was greater than that of Earth's sun. That gave it a gravitational field a quarter of a billion billion times as strong as that of the surface of Earth. If we could somehow set foot on it, we wouldn't just be squashed flat, we'd be instantly reduced to fine powder by the colossal tidal effects -- the difference in gravitational pull between the soles of our feet and the tops of our heads, stretching us toward and away from the neutron star's center with a kick of 18 billion kilograms.</p>
   <p>A ghostly halo of electromagnetic energy surrounded the neutron star: X rays, radio waves, gammas, and an oily, crackling flicker of violet light. The neutron star was rotating on its axis some 550 times a second, and powerful jets of electrons were spouting from its magnetic poles at each sweep, sending forth a beaconlike pulsar broadcast of the familiar type that we have been able to detect since the middle of the twentieth century.</p>
   <p>Behind that zone of fiercely outflung radiation lay the neutron star's atmosphere: an envelope of gaseous iron a few centimeters thick. Below that, our scan had told us, was a two-kilometers-thick crust of normal matter, heavy elements only, ranging from molybdenum on up to transuranies with atomic numbers as high as 140. And within that was the neutronium zone, the stripped nuclei of iron packed unimaginably close together, an ocean of strangeness nine kilometers deep. What lay at the heart of <emphasis>that</emphasis>, we could only guess.</p>
   <p>We had come here to plunge a probe into the neutronium zone and carry off a spoonful of star-stuff that weighed 100 billion tons per cubic centimeter.</p>
   <p>No sort of conventional landing on the neutron star was possible or even conceivable. Not only was the gravitational pull beyond our comprehension -- anything that was capable of withstanding the tidal effects would still have to cope with an escape velocity requirement of 200,000 kilometers per second when it tried to take off, two-thirds the speed of light -- but the neutron star's surface temperature was something like 3.5 million degrees. The surface temperature of our own sun is six <emphasis>thousand</emphasis> degrees, and we don't try to make landings there. Even at this distance, our heat and radiation shields were straining to the limits to keep us from being cooked. We didn't intend to go any closer.</p>
   <p>What IBM/Toshiba wanted us to do was to put a miniature hyperspace ship into orbit around the neutron star: an astonishing little vessel no bigger than your clenched fist, powered by a fantastically scaled-down version of the drive that had carried us through the space-time manifold across a span of a thousand light-years in a dozen weeks. The little ship was a slave-drone; we would operate it from the <emphasis>Ben-wah Maru</emphasis>. Or, rather, Brain Central would. In a maneuver that had taken fifty computer-years to program, we would send the miniature into hyperspace and bring it out again <emphasis>right inside the neutron star</emphasis>. And keep it there a billionth of a second, long enough for it to gulp the spoonful of neutronium we had been sent here to collect. Then we'd head for home, with the miniature ship following us along the same hyperpath.</p>
   <p>We'd head for home -- that is, unless the slave-drone's brief intrusion into the neutron star released disruptive forces that splattered us all over this end of the galaxy. IBM/Toshiba didn't really think that was going to happen. In theory a neutron star is one of the most stable things there is in the universe, and the math didn't indicate that taking a nip from its interior would cause real problems. This neighborhood had already had its full quota of giant explosions anyway.</p>
   <p>Still, the possibility existed. Especially since there was a black hole just thirty light-minutes away, a souvenir of the second and much larger supernova bang that had happened here in the recent past. Having a black hole nearby is a little like playing with an extra wild card whose existence isn't made known to the players until some randomly chosen moment midway through the game. If we destabilized the neutron star in some way not anticipated by the scientists back on Earth, we might just find ourselves going for a visit to the event horizon instead of getting to go home. Or we might not. There was only one way of finding out.</p>
   <p>I didn't know, by the way, what use the parent companies planned to make of the neutronium we had been hired to bring them. I hoped it was a good one.</p>
   <p>But obviously we weren't going to tackle any of this while there was an alien ship in the vicinity. So all we could do was wait. And see. Right now we were doing a lot of waiting, and no seeing at all.</p>
   <subtitle>* * * *</subtitle>
   <p>Two days later Cal Bjornsen said, "We're getting a message back from them now. Audio only. In English."</p>
   <p>We had wanted that, we had even hoped for that. And yet it shook me to learn that it was happening.</p>
   <p>"Let's hear it," I said.</p>
   <p>"The relay's coming over ship channel seven."</p>
   <p>I tuned in. What I heard was an obviously synthetic voice, no undertones or overtones, not much inflection. They were trying to mimic the speech rhythms of what we had sent them, and I suppose they were actually doing a fair job of it, but the result was still unmistakably mechanical-sounding. Of course, there might be nothing on board that ship but a computer, I thought, or maybe robots. I wish now that they had been robots.</p>
   <p>It had the absolute and utter familiarity of a recurring dream. In stiff, halting, but weirdly comprehensible English came the first greetings of an alien race to the people of the planet of Earth. "This who speak be First of Nine Sparg," the voice said. Nine Sparg, we soon realized from context, was the name of their planet. First might have been the speaker's name, or his-hers, its? -- title; that was unclear, and stayed that way. In an awkward pidgin-English that we nevertheless had little trouble understanding, First expressed gratitude for our transmission and asked us to send more words. To send a dictionary, in fact: now that they had the algorithm for our speech they needed more content to jam in behind it, so that we could go on to exchange more complex statements than Hello and How are you.</p>
   <p>Bjornsen queried me on the override. "We've got an English program that we could start feeding them," he said. "Thirty thousand words: that should give them plenty. You want me to put it on for them?"</p>
   <p>"Not so fast," I said. "We need to edit it first."</p>
   <p>"For what?"</p>
   <p>"Anything that might help them find the location of Earth. That's in our orders, under Eventuality of Contact with Extraterrestrials. Remember, I have Nakamura and Nagy-Szabo breathing down my neck, telling me that there's a ship full of boogeymen out there and we mustn't have anything to do with them. I don't believe that myself. But right now we don't know how friendly these Spargs are and we aren't supposed to bring strangers home with us."</p>
   <p>"But how could a dictionary entry -- "</p>
   <p>"Suppose the sun -- <emphasis>our</emphasis> sun -- is defined as a yellow G2-type star," I said. "That gives them a pretty good beginning. Or something about the constellations as seen from Earth. I don't know, Cal. I just want to make sure we don't accidentally hand these beings a road map to our home planet before we find out what sort of critters they are."</p>
   <p>Three of us spent half a day screening the dictionary, and we put Brain Central to work on it, too. In the end we pulled seven words -- you'd laugh if you knew which they were, but we wanted to be careful -- and sent the rest across to the Spargs. They were silent for nine or ten hours. When they came back on the air, their command of English was immensely more fluent. Frighteningly more fluent. Yesterday, First had sounded like a tourist using a Fifty Handy Phrases program. A day later, First's command of English was as good as that of an intelligent Japanese who has been living in the United States for ten or fifteen years.</p>
   <p>It was a tense, wary conversation. Or so it seemed to me, the way it began to seem that First was male and that his way of speaking was brusque and bluntly probing. I may have been wrong on every count.</p>
   <p>First wanted to know who we were and why we were here. Jumping right in, getting down to the heart of the matter. I felt a little like a butterfly collector who has wandered onto the grounds of a fusion plant and is being interrogated by a security guard. But I kept my tone and phrasing as neutral as I could, and told him that our planet was called Earth and that we had come on a mission of exploration and investigation.</p>
   <p>So had they, he told me. Where is Earth?</p>
   <p>Pretty straightforward of him, I thought. I answered that I lacked at this point a means of explaining galactic positions to him in terms that he would understand. I did volunteer the information that Earth was not anywhere close at hand.</p>
   <p>He was willing to drop that line of inquiry for the time being. He shifted to the other obvious one:</p>
   <p>What were we investigating?</p>
   <p>Certain properties of collapsed stars, I said, after a bit of hesitation.</p>
   <p>And which properties were those?</p>
   <p>I told him that we didn't have enough vocabulary in common for me to try to explain that either.</p>
   <p>The Nine Sparg captain seemed to accept that evasion, too. And provided me with a pause that indicated that it was my turn. Fair enough.</p>
   <p>When I asked him what <emphasis>he</emphasis> was doing here, he replied without any apparent trace of evasiveness that he had come on a mission of historical inquiry. I pressed for details. It has to do with the ancestry of our race, he said. We used to live in this part of the galaxy, before the great explosion. No hesitation at all about telling me that. It struck me that First was being less reticent about dealing with my queries than I was with his; but, of course, I had no way of judging whether I was hearing the truth from him.</p>
   <p>"I'd like to know more," I said, as much as a test as anything else. "How long ago did your people flee this great explosion? And how far from here is your present home world?"</p>
   <p>A long silence: several minutes. I wondered uncomfortably if I had over-played my hand. If they were as edgy about our finding their home world as I was about their finding ours, I had to be careful not to push them into an overreaction. They might just think that the safest thing to do would be to blow us out of the sky as soon as they had learned all they could from us.</p>
   <p>But when First spoke again it was only to say, "Are you willing to establish contact in the visual band?"</p>
   <p>"Is such a thing possible?"</p>
   <p>"We think so," he said.</p>
   <p>I thought about it. Would letting them see what we looked like give them any sort of clue to the location of Earth? Perhaps, but it seemed farfetched. Maybe they'd be able to guess that we were carbon-based oxygen-breathers, but the risk of allowing them to know that seemed relatively small. And in any case we'd find out what <emphasis>they</emphasis> looked like. An even trade, right?</p>
   <p>I had my doubts that their video transmission system could be made compatible with our receiving equipment. But I gave First the go-ahead and turned the microphone over to the communications staff. Who struggled with the problem for a day and a half. Sending the signal back and forth was no big deal, but breaking it down into information that would paint a picture on a cathode-ray tube was a different matter. The communications people at both ends talked and talked and talked, while I fretted about how much technical information about us we were revealing to the Spargs. The tinkering went on and on, and nothing appeared on screen except occasional strings of horizontal lines. We sent them more data about how our television system worked. They made further adjustments in their transmission devices. This time we got spots instead of lines. We sent even more data. Were they leading us on? And were we telling them too much? I came finally to the position that trying to make the video link work had been a bad idea, and started to tell Communications that. But then the haze of drifting spots on my screen abruptly cleared and I found myself looking into the face of an alien being.</p>
   <p>An alien face, yes. Extremely alien. Suddenly this whole interchange was kicked up to a new level of reality.</p>
   <p>A hairless wedge-shaped head, flat and broad on top, tapering to a sharp point below. Corrugated skin that looked as thick as heavy rubber. Two chilly eyes in the center of that wide forehead and two more at its extreme edges. Three mouths, vertical slits, side by side: one for speaking, and the other two maybe for separate intake of fluids and solids. The whole business supported by three long columnar necks as thick as a man's wrist, separated by open spaces two or three centimeters wide. What was below the neck we never got to see. But the head alone was plenty.</p>
   <p>They probably thought we were just as strange.</p>
   <subtitle>* * * *</subtitle>
   <p>With video established, First and I picked up our conversation right where he had broken it off the day before. Once more he was not in the least shy about telling me things.</p>
   <p>He had been able to calculate in our units of time the date of the great explosion that had driven his people from their home world: it had taken place 387 years ago. He didn't use the word "supernova," because it hadn't been included in the 30,000-word vocabulary we had sent them, but that was obviously what he meant by "the great explosion." The 387-year figure squared pretty well with our own calculations, which were based on an analysis of the surface temperature and rate of rotation of the neutron star.</p>
   <p>The Nine Sparg people had had plenty of warning that their sun was behaving oddly -- the first signs of instability had become apparent more than a century before the blowup -- and they had devoted all their energy for several generations to the job of packing up and clearing out. It had taken many years, it seemed, for them to accomplish their migration to the distant new world they had chosen for their new home. Did that mean, I asked myself, that their method of interstellar travel was much slower than ours, and that they had needed decades or even a century to cover fifty or a hundred light-years? Earth had less to worry about, then. Even if they wanted to make trouble for us, they wouldn't be able easily to reach us, a thousand light-years from here. Or was First saying that their new world was <emphasis>really</emphasis> distant -- all the way across the galaxy, perhaps, seventy or eighty thousand light-years away, or even in some other galaxy altogether? If that was the case, we were up against truly superior beings. But there was no easy way for me to question him about such things without telling him things about our own hyperdrive and our distance from this system that I didn't care to have him know.</p>
   <p>After a long and evidently difficult period of settling in on the new world, First went on, the Nine Sparg folk finally were well enough established to launch an inquiry into the condition of their former home planet. Thus his mission to the supernova site.</p>
   <p>"But we are in great mystery," First admitted, and it seemed to me that a note of sadness and bewilderment had crept into his mechanical-sounding voice. "We have come to what certainly is the right location. Yet nothing seems to be correct here. We find only this little iron star. And of our former planet there is no trace."</p>
   <p>I stared at that peculiar and unfathomable four-eyed face, that three-columned neck, those tight vertical mouths, and to my surprise something close to compassion awoke in me. I had been dealing with this creature as though be were a potential enemy capable of leading armadas of war to my world and conquering it. But in fact he might be merely a scholarly explorer who was making a nostalgic pilgrimage and running into problems with it. I decided to relax my guard just a little.</p>
   <p>"Have you considered, " I said, "that you might not be in the right location after all?"</p>
   <p>"What do you mean?"</p>
   <p>"As we were completing our journey toward what you call the iron star," I said, "we discovered a planet forty light-years from here that beyond much doubt had had a great civilization, and which evidently was close enough to the exploding star system here to have been devastated by it. We have pictures of it that we could show you. Perhaps <emphasis>that</emphasis> was your home world."</p>
   <p>Even as I was saying it the idea started to seem foolish to me. The skeletons we had photographed on the dead world had had broad tapering heads that might perhaps have been similar to those of First, but they hadn't shown any evidence of this unique triple-neck arrangement. Besides, First had said that his people had had several generations to prepare for evacuation. Would they have left so many millions of their people behind to die? It looked obvious from the way those skeletons were scattered around that the inhabitants of that planet hadn't had the slightest clue that doom was due to overtake them that day. And finally, I realized that First had plainly said that it was his own world's sun that had exploded, not some neighboring star. The supernova had happened here. The dead world's sun was still intact.</p>
   <p>"Can you show me your pictures?" he said.</p>
   <p>It seemed pointless. But I felt odd about retracting my offer. And in the new rapport that had sprung up between us I could see no harm in it.</p>
   <p>I told Lina Sorabji to feed her sonar transparencies into the relay pickup. It was easy enough for Cal Biomsen to shunt them into our video transmission to the alien ship.</p>
   <p>The Nine Sparg captain withheld his comment until we had shown him the batch.</p>
   <p>Then he said, "Oh, that was not our world. That was the world of the Garvalekkinon people."</p>
   <p>"The Garvalekkinon?"</p>
   <p>"We knew them. A neighboring race, not related to us. Sometimes, on rare occasions, we traded with them. Yes, they must all have died when the star exploded. It is too bad."</p>
   <p>"They look as though they had no warning," I said. "Look: can you see them there, waiting in the train stations?"</p>
   <p>The triple mouths fluttered in what might have been the Nine Sparg equivalent of a nod.</p>
   <p>"I suppose they did not know the explosion was coming."</p>
   <p>"You suppose? You mean you didn't tell them?"</p>
   <p>All four eyes blinked at once. Expression of puzzlement.</p>
   <p>"Tell them? Why should we have told them? We were busy with our preparations. We had no time for them. Of course, the radiation would have been harmful to them, but why was that our concern? They were not related to us. They were nothing to us."</p>
   <p>I had trouble believing I had heard him correctly. A neighboring people. Occasional trading partners. Your sun is about to blow up, and it's reasonable to assume that nearby solar systems will be affected. You have fifty or a hundred years of advance notice yourselves, and you can't even take the trouble to let these other people know whats going to happen?</p>
   <p>I said, "You felt no need at all to warn them? That isn't easy for me to understand."</p>
   <p>Again the four-eyed shrug.</p>
   <p>"I have explained it to you already," said First. "They were not of our kind. They were nothing to us."</p>
   <subtitle>* * * *</subtitle>
   <p>I excused myself on some flimsy excuse and broke contact. And sat and thought a long long while. Listening to the words of the Nine Sparg captain echoing in my mind. And thinking of the millions of skeletons scattered like straws in the tunnels of that dead world that the supernova had baked. A whole people left to die because it was inconvenient to take five minutes to send them a message. Or perhaps because it simply never had occurred to anybody to bother.</p>
   <p>The families, huddling together. The children reaching out. The husbands and wives with hands interlocked.</p>
   <p>A world of busy, happy, intelligent people. Boulevards and temples. Parks and gardens. Paintings, sculpture, poetry, music. History, philosophy, science. And a sudden star in the sky, and everything gone in a moment.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Why should we have told them? They were nothing to us.</emphasis></p>
   <p>I knew something of the history of my own people. We had experienced casual extermination, too. But at least when the white settlers had done it to us it was because they had wanted our land.</p>
   <p>For the first time I understood the meaning of alien.</p>
   <p>I turned on the external screen and stared out at the unfamiliar sky of this place. The neutron star was barely visible, a dull red dot, far down in the lower left quadrant; and the black hole was high.</p>
   <p>Once they had both been stars. What havoc must have attended their destruction! It must have been the Sparg sun that blew first, the one that had become the neutron star. And then, fifty or a hundred years later, perhaps, the other, larger star had gone the same route. Another titanic supernova, a great flare of killing light. But, of course, everything for hundreds of light-years around had perished already in the first blast.</p>
   <p>The second sun had been too big to leave a neutron star behind. So great was its mass that the process of collapse had continued on beyond the neutron-star stage, matter crushing in upon itself until it broke through the normal barriers of space and took on a bizarre and almost unthinkable form, creating an object of infinitely small volume that was nevertheless of infinite density: a black hole, a pocket of incomprehensibility where once a star had been.</p>
   <p>I stared now at the black hole before me.</p>
   <p>I couldn't see it, of course. So powerful was the surface gravity of that grotesque thing that nothing could escape from it, not even electromagnetic radiation, not the merest particle of light. The ultimate in invisibility cloaked that infinitely deep hole in space.</p>
   <p>But though the black hole itself was invisible, the effects that its presence caused were not. That terrible gravitational pull would rip apart and swallow any solid object that came too close; and so the hole was surrounded by a bright ring of dust and gas several hundred kilometers across. These shimmering particles constantly tumbled toward that insatiable mouth, colliding as they spiraled in, releasing flaring fountains of radiation, red-shifted into the visual spectrum by the enormous gravity: the bright green of helium, the majestic purple of hydrogen, the crimson of oxygen. That outpouring of energy was the death cry of doomed matter. That rainbow whirlpool of blazing light was the beacon marking the maw of the black hole.</p>
   <p>I found it oddly comforting to stare at that thing. To contemplate that zone of eternal quietude from which there was no escape. Pondering so inexorable and unanswerable an infinity was more soothing than thinking of a world of busy people destroyed by the indifference of their neighbors. Black holes offer no choices, no complexities, no shades of disagreement. They are absolute.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Why should we have told them? They were nothing to us.</emphasis></p>
   <p>After a time I restored contact with the Nine Sparg ship. First came to the screen at once, ready to continue our conversation.</p>
   <p>"There is no question that our world once was located here," he said at once. "We have checked and rechecked the coordinates. But the changes have been extraordinary."</p>
   <p>"Have they?"</p>
   <p>"Once there were two stars here, our own and the brilliant blue one that was nearby. Our history is very specific on that point: a brilliant blue star that lit the entire sky. Now we have only the iron star. Apparently it has taken the place of our sun. But where has the blue one gone? Could the explosion have destroyed it, too?"</p>
   <p>I frowned. Did they really not know? Could a race be capable of attaining an interstellar spacedrive and an interspecies translating device, and nevertheless not have arrived at any understanding of the neutron star/black hole cosmology?</p>
   <p>Why not? They were aliens. They had come by all their understanding of the universe via a route different from ours. They might well have overlooked this feature or that of the universe about them.</p>
   <p>"The blue star -- " I began.</p>
   <p>But First spoke right over me, saying, "It is a mystery that we must devote all our energies to solving, or our mission will be fruitless. But let us talk of other things. You have said little of your own mission. And of your home world. I am filled with great curiosity, Captain, about those subjects."</p>
   <p>I'm sure you are, I thought.</p>
   <p>"We have only begun our return to space travel," said First. "Thus far we have encountered no other intelligent races. And so we regard this meeting as fortunate. It is our wish to initiate contact with you. Quite likely some aspects of your technology would be valuable to us. And there will be much that you wish to purchase from us. Therefore, we would be glad to establish trade relations with you."</p>
   <p>As you did with the Garvalekkinon people, I said to myself.</p>
   <p>I said, "We can speak of that tomorrow, Captain. I grow tired now. But before we break contact for the day, allow me to offer you the beginning of a solution to the mystery of the disappearance of the blue sun."</p>
   <p>The four eyes widened. The slitted mouths parted in what seemed surely to be excitement.</p>
   <p>"Can you do that?"</p>
   <p>I took a deep breath.</p>
   <p>"We have some preliminary knowledge. Do you see the place opposite the iron star, where energies boil and circle in the sky? As we entered this system, we found certain evidence there that may explain the fate of your former blue sun. You would do well to center your investigations on that spot."</p>
   <p>"We are most grateful," said First.</p>
   <p>"And now, Captain, I must bid you good night. Until tomorrow, Captain."</p>
   <p>"Until tomorrow," said the alien.</p>
   <subtitle>* * * *</subtitle>
   <p>I was awakened in the middle of my sleep period by Lina Sorabii and Bryce-Williamson, both of them looking flushed and sweaty. I sat up, blinking and shaking my head.</p>
   <p>"It's the alien ship," Bryce-Williamson blurted. "It's approaching the black hole."</p>
   <p>"Is it, now?"</p>
   <p>"Dangerously close," said Lina. "What do they think they're doing? Don't they know?"</p>
   <p>"I don't think so," I said. "I suggested that they go exploring there. Evidently they don't regard it as a bad idea."</p>
   <p>"You sent them there?" she said incredulously.</p>
   <p>With a shrug I said, "I told them that if they went over there they might find the answer to the question of where one of their missing suns went. I guess they've decided to see if I was right."</p>
   <p>"We have to warn them," said Bryce-Williamson. "Before its too late. Especially if we're responsible for sending them there. They'll be furious with us once they realize that we failed to warn them of the danger."</p>
   <p>"By the time they realize it," I replied calmly, "it <emphasis>will</emphasis> be too late. And then their fury won't matter, will it? They won't be able to tell us how annoyed they are with us. Or to report to their home world, for that matter, that they had an encounter with intelligent aliens who might be worth exploiting."</p>
   <p>He gave me an odd look. The truth was starting to sink in.</p>
   <p>I turned on the external screens and punched up a close look at the black hole region. Yes, there was the alien ship, the little metallic sphere, the six odd outthrust legs. It was in the zone of criticality now. It seemed hardly to be moving at all. And it was growing dimmer and dimmer as it slowed. The gravitational field had it, and it was being drawn in. Blacking out, becoming motionless. Soon it would have gone beyond the point where outside observers could perceive it. Already it was beyond the point of turning back.</p>
   <p>I heard Lina sobbing behind me. Bryce-Williamson was muttering to himself, praying, perhaps.</p>
   <p>I said, "Who can say what they would have done to us -- in their casual, indifferent way -- once they came to Earth? We know now that Spargs worry only about Spargs. Anybody else is just so much furniture." I shook my head. "To hell with them. They're gone, and in a universe this big we'll probably never come across any of them again, or they us. Which is just fine. We'll be a lot better off having nothing at all to do with them."</p>
   <p>"But to die that way -- " Lina murmured. "To sail blindly into a black hole -- "</p>
   <p>"It is a great tragedy," said Bryce-Williamson.</p>
   <p>"A tragedy for them," I said. "For us, a reprieve, I think. And tomorrow we can get moving on the neutronium-scoop project." I tuned up the screen to the next level. The boiling cloud of matter around the mouth of the black hole blazed fiercely. But of the alien ship there was nothing to be seen.</p>
   <p>Yes, a great tragedy, I thought. The valiant exploratory mission that had sought the remains of the Nine Sparg home world has been lost with all hands. No hope of rescue. A pity that they hadn't known how unpleasant black holes can be.</p>
   <p>But why should we have told them? They were nothing to us.</p>
