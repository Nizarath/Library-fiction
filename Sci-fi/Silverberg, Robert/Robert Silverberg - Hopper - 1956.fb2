   <p>The warning bell rang, but Quellen left it alone. He was in a mood, and didn't care to break it just to answer the phone.</p>
   <p>He continued to rock uneasily back and forth in his pneumo-chair, watching the crocodiles padding gently through the stream's murky waters. After a while the bell stopped ringing. He sat there, joyously passive, sensing about him the warm smell of growing things and the buzzing insect-noises in the air.</p>
   <p>That was the only part he didn't like, the constant hum of the ugly insects that whizzed through the calm air. In a way they represented an invasion; they were symbols of the life he had led before moving up to Class Thirteen. The noise in the air then had been the steady buzz of people, people swarming around in a great hive of a city, and Quellen detested that.</p>
   <p>Idly he flipped a stone into the water. "Get it!" he called, as two crocs glided noiselessly toward the disturbance. But the stone sank, sending up black bubbles, and the crocs bumped their pointed noses lightly together and swam away.</p>
   <p>He rehearsed the catalogue of his blessings. <emphasis>Marok, </emphasis>he thought. <emphasis>No Marok, No KoU, no Spanner, no Brogg, no Mikken. But especially no Marok. </emphasis>He sighed, thinking of them all. What a relief to be able to stat out here and suffer their buzzing voices, not shudder when they burst into his office! And being far from Marok was best of all. No more to worry over his piles of undone dishes, his heaps of books all over the tiny room they shared, his dry, deep voice endlessly talking into the visiphone when Quellen was trying to concentrate. <emphasis>No. No Marok.</emphasis></p>
   <p>But yet, Quellen thought sadly, yet, the peace he had anticipated when he built his new home had somehow not materialized. For years he had waited with remarkable patience for the day he reached Class Thirteen and was entitled to live alone. And now that he had encompassed his goal, life was one uneasy fear after another.</p>
   <p>He shied another stone into the water.</p>
   <p>As he watched the concentric circles of ripples fanning out on the dark surface of the stream, Quellen became conscious of the warning bell ringing again at the other end of the house. The uneasiness within him turned to sullen foreboding. He eased himself out of his chair and headed hurriedly toward the phone.</p>
   <p>He switched it on, leaving the vision off. It hadn't been easy to arrange it so that any calls coming to his home, back in Appalachia, were automatically relaying to him here.</p>
   <p>"Quellen, he said.</p>
   <p>"Koll speaking," was the reply. "Couldn't reach you before. Why don't you turn on your visi, Quellen?"</p>
   <p>"It's not working," Quellen said. He hoped sharp-nosed Koll wouldn't smell the lie in his voice.</p>
   <p>"Get over here quickly, will you?" Koll said. "Spanner and I have something urgent to take up with you. Got it, Quellen?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, sir. Anything else, sir?" Quellen said limply.</p>
   <p>"No. Well fill you in when you get here." Koll snapped the contact decisively.</p>
   <p>Quellen stared at the blank screen for a while, chewing his lip. They couldn't have found out. He had everything squared. But, came the insistent thought, they must have discovered Quellen's secret. Why else would Koll send for him so urgendy? Quellen began to perspire despite the airconditioning which kept out most of the fierce Congo heat.</p>
   <p>They would put him back in Class Twelve if they found out. Or, more likely, they would bounce him all the way back to Eight. He would spend the rest of his life in a tiny room inhabited by two or three other people, the biggest, smelliest, most unpleasant people they could find.</p>
   <p>Quellen took a long look at the green overhanging trees, bowed under the weight of their leaves. He let his eyes rove regretfully over his two spacious rooms, the luxurious porch, the uncluttered view. For a moment, now that everything was just about lost, he almost relished the buzzing of the flies. He took a final sweeping look, and stepped into the stat.</p>
   <p>He emerged in the tiny apartment for Class Thirteen Appalachians which everyone thought he inhabited. In a series of swift motions he got out of his lounging clothes and into his business uniform, removed the <emphasis>Privacy </emphasis>radion from the door, and transformed himself from Joe Quellen, owner of an illegal privacy-nest in the heart of an unreported reservation in Africa, into Joseph Quellen CrimeSec, staunch defender of law and order. Then he caught a quickboat and headed downtown to meet Koll, aching numbly from fear.</p>
   <p>They were waiting for him when he entered. Little sharp-nosed Koll, looking for all the world like some huge rodent, was facing the door, sifting through a sheaf of minislips. Spanner sat opposite him at the table, his great bull neck hunched over still more memoranda. As Quellen entered, Koll reached to the wall and flipped the oxy vent, admitting a supply for three.</p>
   <p>"Took you long enough," Koll said, without looking up.</p>
   <p>"Sorry," Quellen mumbled. "Had to change."</p>
   <p>"Whatever we do won't alter anything," said Spanner, as if no one had entered. "What's happened has happened, and nothing we do will have the slightest effect."</p>
   <p>"Sit down, Quellen," Koll said. He turned to Spanner. "I thought we'd been through this all before. If we meddle it's going to mix up everything. With almost a thousand years to cover,' we'll scramble the whole framework."</p>
   <p>Quellen silendy breathed relief. Whatever it was they were concerned about, it wasn't his illegal African hideaway. He looked at his two superiors more carefully, now that his eyes were no longer blurred by fear and anticipation. They had obviously been arguing quite a while. Koll was the deep one, Quellen reflected, but Spanner had more power.</p>
   <p>"All right, Koll. Ill even grant that it'll mix up the past. I'll concede that much."</p>
   <p>"Well, that's something," the small man said.</p>
   <p>"Don't interrupt me. I still think we've got to stop it."</p>
   <p>Koll glared at Spanner and Quellen could see that the only reason he was concealing the anger lying just behind his eyes was Quellen's presence. "Why, Spanner, why? If we keep the process going we maintain things as they are. Four thousand of them have gone already, and that's only a drop. Look—here it says that over a million arrived in the first three centuries, and after that the figures kept rising. Think of the population we're losing! It's wonderful! We can't <emphasis>afford</emphasis>to let these people stay here, when we have a chance to get rid of them. And when history says that we did get rid of them."</p>
   <p>Spanner grunted and looked at the minislips he was holding. Quellen's eyes flicked back from one man to the other.</p>
   <p>"All right," Spanner said slowly. "I'll agree that it's nice to keep losing all those prolets. But I think we're being hoodwinked as well. Here's my idea: we have to let it keep going on, you say, or else it'll alter the past. I won't argue the point, since you seem so positive. Furthermore, you think it's a good thing to use this business as a method of reducing population. I'm with you on that too. I don't like overcrowding any more than you do, and I'll admit things have reached a ridiculous state nowadays. But—on the other hand, for someone to be running a time-travel business behind our backs is illegal and unethical and a lot of other things, and he ought to be stopped. What do you say, Quellen? This is your department you know."</p>
   <p>The sudden reference to him came as a jolt. Quellen was still struggling to discover exactly what it was they were talking about. He smiled weakly and shook his head.</p>
   <p>"No opinion?" Koll asked sharply. Quellen looked at him. He was unable to stare straight into Koll's hard eyes, and let his gaze rest on the Manager's cheekbones instead. "No opinion, Quellen? That's too bad indeed. It doesn't speak well of you."</p>
   <p>Quellen shuddered. "I haven't been keeping up with the latest developments in the case. I've been very busy on certain projects that—"</p>
   <p>He let his voice trail off. His eager assistants probably knew all about this situation, he thought. <emphasis>Why didn't I check with Brogg before now?</emphasis></p>
   <p>"Are you aware that four thousand prolets have vanished into nowhere since the beginning of the year?"</p>
   <p>"No, sir. Ah, I mean, of course, sir. It's just that we haven't had a chance to act on it yet." <emphasis>Very lame, Quellen, very lame,</emphasis>he told himself. <emphasis>Of course you don't know anything about it, not when you spend all your time at that pretty little hideaway across the ocean. But Brogg probably knows all about it. He's very efficient.</emphasis></p>
   <p>"Well, just where do you think they've gone?" Koll asked. "Maybe you think they've all hopped into stats and gone off somewhere to look for work? To Africa, maybe?"</p>
   <p>The barb had poison on it. Quellen winced, hiding his reaction as well as he could.</p>
   <p>"I have no idea, sir."</p>
   <p>"You haven't been reading your history books very well, then, Quellen. Think, man: what was the most important historical development of the past ten centuries?"</p>
   <p>Quellen thought. What, indeed? There was so much, and he had always been weak on history. He began to sweat. Koll casually flipped the oxy up a little higher in an almost insulting gesture of friendliness.</p>
   <p>Til tell you, then. It's the arrival of the hoppers. And <emphasis>this </emphasis>is the year they're starting out from."</p>
   <p>"Of course," Queilen said, annoyed with himself. Everyone knew about the hoppers. Koll's reminder was a pointed slur.</p>
   <p>"Someone's developed time travel this year," Spanner said. "He's, beginning to siphon the hoppers back to the past. Four thousand unemployed prolets are gone already, and if we don't catch him soon he'll clutter up the past with every wandering workingman in the country."</p>
   <p>"So? That's just my point," Koll said impatiently. "We know they've already arrived in the past; our history books say so. Now we can sit back and let this fellow distribute our refuse all over the past."</p>
   <p>Spanner swivelled around and confronted Queilen. "What do you think?" he demanded. "Should we round up this fellow and stop the departure of the Hoppers? Or should we do as Koll says, and let everything go on?"</p>
   <p>"I'll need time to study the case," Queilen said suspiciously. The last thing he wanted to do was be forced into making a judgment in favor of one superior over another.</p>
   <p>"I have ah idea," Spanner said to Koll. "Why not catch this slyster and get him to turn over his time-travel gadget to the' government? Then <emphasis>we </emphasis>could run a government service and charge the hoppers a fee to be sent back. It's fine all around—we'd catch our man, the government would have time-travel on a platter, the hoppers would still go back without changing the past, and we'll make a little money on the deal."</p>
   <p>Koll brightened. "Perfect solution," he said. "Brilliant, Spanner. Queilen—"</p>
   <p>Queilen stiffened. "Yes, sir?"</p>
   <p>"Get on it, fast. Track down this fellow and put him away, but not before you get his secret out of him. As soon as you locate him the government can go into the hopper-exporting trade."</p>

   <p>Once he was back in his own office, behind his own small but private desk, Quellen could feel important again. He rang for Brogg and Mikken, and the two UnderSecs appeared almost instantly.</p>
   <p>"Good to see you again," Brogg said sourly. Quellen opened the vent and let oxy flow into the office, trying to capture the patronizing look Koll had flashed while doing the same thing ten minutes before.</p>
   <p>Mikken nodded curtly. Quellen surveyed the two of them. Brogg was the one who knew the secret; a third of Quellen's salary paid him to keep quiet about Quellen's second, secret home. Big Mikken did not know and did not care; he took his orders directly from Brogg, not from Quellen.</p>
   <p>"I suppose you're familiar with the recent prolet disappearances," Quellen began.</p>
   <p>Brogg produced a thick stack of minislips. "As a matter of fact, I was just going to get in touch with you about them. It seems that four thousand unemployed prolets have vanished so far this year."</p>
   <p>"What have you done so far towards solving the case?" asked Quellen.</p>
   <p>"Well," Brogg said, pacing up and down the little room and wiping the sweat from his heavy jowls, "I've determined that these disappearances are directly connected to historical records of the appearance of the hoppers in the late Twentieth Century and succeeding years." Brogg pointed to the book lying on Quellen's desk. "History book. I put it there for you. It confirms my findings."</p>
   <p>Quellen ran a finger along his jawline and wondered what it was like to carry around as much fat on one's face as Brogg did. Brogg was perspiring heavily, and his face was virtually begging Quellen to open the oxy vent wider.</p>
   <p>The moment of superiority pleased the CrimeSec, and he made no move toward the wall.</p>
   <p>"I've already taken these factors into consideration," said Quellen. "I've developed a course of action."</p>
   <p>"Have you checked it with Koll and Spanner?" Brogg said insolently. His jowls quivered as his voice rumbled through them.</p>
   <p>"I have," Quellen said with as much force as he could muster, angry that Brogg had so easily deflated him. "I want you to track down the slyster who's shipping these hoppers back. Bring him here. I want him caught before he sends anyone else into the past."</p>
   <p>"Yes sir," Brogg said resignedly. "Come on, Mikken." The other assistant reluctantly left his chair and followed Brogg out. Quellen watched them quizzically through his view-window as they appeared on the street, jostled their way to a belt, and disappeared among the multitudes that thronged the streets. Then, with almost savage joy, he flipped the oxy vent to its widest, and leaned back.</p>
   <p>After a while Quellen decided to brief himself on the situation. Conquering his apathy was not easy, since foremost in his mind was the desire to get out of Appalachia and back to Africa as quickly as he could.</p>
   <p>He snapped on the projector and the history book began to unroll. He watched it stream by.</p>
   <p><emphasis>The first sign of invasion from the future came about 1962, when several men in strange costumes appeared in the part of Appalachia then known as Manhattan. Records show they appeared with increasing frequency throughout the next decade, and when interrogated all admitted that they had come from the future. Pressure of repeated evidence eventually forced the people of the 20th Century to the conclusion that they were actually being subjected to a peaceful but annoying invasion by time-travellers.</emphasis></p>
   <p>There was more, a whole reel more, but Quellen had had enough. He cut the projector off. The heat of the little room was oppressive, despite the air conditioning and the oxy vent. Quellen looked despairingly at the confining walls, and thought with longing of the murky stream that ran by his African retreat's front porch.</p>
   <p>"I've done all I can," he said, and stepped out the window to catch the nearest quickboat back to his Class Thirteen apartment. Fleetingly he considered the idea of getting Brogg to handle the whole case while he went back to Africa, but he decided that would be inviting disaster.</p>
   <p>Quellen had neglected to keep his foodstocks in good supply, he discovered, and, since his stay in Appalachia threatened to be long or possibly permanent, he decided to replenish his stores. He fastened the <emphasis>Privacy</emphasis>radion to his door again and headed down the twisting flyramp to the supply shop, intending to stock up for a long siege.</p>
   <p>As he made his way down, he noticed a sallow-looking man heading in the opposite direction up the ramp. Quellen did not recognize him, but that was unsurprising; in the crowded turmoil of Appalachia, one never got to know very many people, just the keeper of the supply shop and a handful of neighbors.</p>
   <p>The sallow-looking man stared curiously at him and seemed to be saying something with his eyes. He brushed against Quellen and shoved a wadded minislip into his hand. Quellen unfolded it after the other had disappeared up the flyramp, and read it.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Out of work? See Lanoy.</emphasis>That was all it said. Instantiy Quellen's CrimeSec facet came into play. Like most lawbreakers in public office, he was vigorous in prosecution of other law-breakers, and there was something in Lanoy's handbill that smacked of illegality. Quellen turned with the thought of pursuing the hastily-retreating sallow man, but the other had disappeared. He could have gone almost anywhere after leaving the flyramp. <emphasis>Out of work? See Lanoy.</emphasis>Quellen wondered who Lanoy was and what his magic remedy was. He made up his mind that he would have Brogg look into the matter.</p>
   <p>Carefully stowing the minislip in his pocket, Quellen entered the supply shop. The red-faced little man who ran it greeted Quellen with an unusual display of heartiness.</p>
   <p>"Oh, it's the CrimeSec! We haven't been honored by you in a long time, CrimeSec," the rotund shopkeeper said. "I was beginning to think you'd moved. But that's impossible, isn't it? You'd have notified me if you'd gotten a promotion."</p>
   <p>"Yes, Greevy, that's true. I've just not been around lately. Very busy these days." Quellen frowned. He didn't want the news of his absence noised all around the community. He made his order, statted the supplies upstairs, and left the supply shop.</p>
   <p>He stepped out into the street for a moment and stood watching as the multitudes streamed past. Their clothes were of all designs and colors. They talked incessantly. The world was a beehive, vastly overpopulated and getting more so daily. Quellen longed for the quiet retreat he had built at such great cost and with so much trepidation. The more he saw of crocodiles, the less he cared for the company of the mobs who swarmed the crowded cities.</p>
   <p>All sorts of illegal things went on—not, as in Quellen's case, justifiable efforts to escape an intolerable existence, but shady, vicious, unpardonable things. Like this Lanoy, Quellen thought, fingering the minislip in his pocket. How did he manage to hide his activities, whatever they were, from his roommates? Surely he wasn't Class Thirteen.</p>
   <p>Quellen felt a strange kinship with the unseen Lanoy. He too, was beating the game. He was a wily one, possibly worth knowing. Then Quellen moved on.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER III</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Brogg phoned him and got him back to the office in a hurry. Quellen found his two UnderSecs waiting with a third man, a tall, angular, shabbily-dressed fellow with a broken nose that projected beaklike from his face. Brogg had turned the oxy vent up to full.</p>
   <p>"Is this the fellow?" Quellen said. It didn't seem likely that this seedy prolet—too poor, apparendy, to afford a plastic job on his nose—was the force behind the hoppers.</p>
   <p>"Depends on what fellow you mean," Brogg said. "Tell the CrimeSec who you are," he said, nudging the prolet roughly with his elbow.</p>
   <p>"Name is Brand," the prolet said in a thin, oddly high voice. "Class Four. I didn't mean no harm, sir—it was just that he promised me a home all my own, and a job, and fresh air—"</p>
   <p>Brogg cut him off. "We ran up against this fellow in a drinker. He had had one or two too many and was telling everyone that he'd have a job soon."</p>
   <p>"That's what the fellow said," Brand mumbled. "Just had to give him two hundred credits and he'd send me somewhere where everyone had a job. And I'd be able to send money back to bring my family along. It sounded so good, sir."</p>
   <p>"What was this fellow's name?" Quellen asked sharply.</p>
   <p>"Lanoy, sir." Quellen felt a startled pang of recognition at hearing the name. "Someone gave me this and told me to get in touch with him.</p>
   <p>Brand held out a crumpled minislip. Quellen unfolded it and read it. <emphasis>"Out of work? See Lanoy."</emphasis>Very interesting. He reached into his own pocket and pulled out the slip he had been handed on the flyramp. <emphasis>Out of work? See Lanoy.</emphasis>They were identical.</p>
   <p>"Larioy's sent a lot of my friends there," Brand said. "He told me they were all working and. happy there, sir—"</p>
   <p>"Where does he send them?" Quellen asked gently.</p>
   <p>"I don't know, sir. Lanoy said he was going to tell me when I gave him the two hundred credits. I drew out all my savings. I was on my way to him, and I just dropped in for a short one—when—when—"</p>
   <p>"When we found him," Brogg finished. "Telling everyone in sight that he was heading to Lanoy to get a job."</p>
   <p>"Hmm. Do you know what the hoppers are, Brand?"</p>
   <p>"No, sir."</p>
   <p>"Never mind, then. Suppose you take us to Lanoy."</p>
   <p>"I can't do that. It wouldn't be fair. All my friends—" </p>
   <p>"Suppose we <emphasis>make </emphasis>you take us to Lanoy," Quellen said. </p>
   <p>"But he was going to give me a job! I can't do it. Please, sir."</p>
   <p>Brogg looked at Quellen. "Let me try," he said. "Lanoy was going to give you a job, you say? For two hundred credits?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
   <p>"Suppose we tell you that well give you a job for nothing. No charge at all, just lead us to Lanoy and we'll send you where he was going to send you, only free. And we'll send your family along too."</p>
   <p>Quellen smiled. Brogg was a much better psychologist than he was; he was forced to admit it.</p>
   <p>"That's fair," Brand said. "I'll take you. I feel bad about it—Lanoy was nice to me—but if you say you'll send me for nix . . ."</p>
   <p>"Quite right, Brand," Brogg said.</p>
   <p>"I'll do it, then."</p>
   <p>Quellen turned down the oxy vent. "Let's go before he changes his mind," Brogg gestured to Mikken, who led Brand out.</p>
   <p>"Are you coming with us, sir?" Brogg asked. There was just a hint of sarcasm behind Brogg's obsequious tones. "It'll probably be a pretty filthy part of town."</p>
   <p>Quellen shivered. "You're right," he said. "You two take him. I'll wait here."</p>
   <p>As soon as they were gone, Quellen rang Koll.</p>
   <p>"We're hot on the trail," he said. "Brogg and Mikken have found the man who's doing it, and they'll bring him back."</p>
   <p>"Fine work," Koll said coldly. "It should be an interesting investigation. But please don't disturb us for a while. Spanner and I are discussing departmental status changes." He hung up.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Now what did that mean? </emphasis>Quellen wondered. By now he was sure Koll knew about Africa. Brogg had probably been offered a bigger bribe to talk than Quellen had given him to be silent, and he had sold out to the highest bidder. Of course, Koll might have meant a promotion, but demotion was a more likely change in status to discuss.</p>
   <p>Quellen's offense was a unique one. No one else, to his knowledge, had been shrewd enough to find a way out of heavily-overpopulated Appalachia, the octopus of a city that spread all over the eastern half of North America. Of all the two hundred million inhabitants of Appalachia, only Joseph Quellen CrimeSec had been clever enough to find a bit of unknown and unsettled land in the heart of Africa and build himself a second home there. He had the standard Class Thirteen cubicle in Appalachia, plus a Class Twenty mansion beyond the dreams of most mortals, beside a murky stream in the Congo. It was nice, very nice, for a man whose soul rebelled at the insect-like existence in Appalachia.</p>
   <p>The only trouble was that it took money to keep people bribed. There were a few who had to know that Quellen was living luxuriously in Africa instead of dwelling in a ten-by-ten cubicle in Northwest Appalachia, like a good Thirteen. Someone—Brogg, he was sure—had sold out to Koll. And Quellen was on thin ice indeed.</p>
   <p>A demotion would rob him even of the privilege of maintaining a private cubicle, and he would go back to sharing his home, as he had with unlamented Marok. It hadn't been so bad when he had been below Class Twelve and had lived, first in the dorms, then in gradually more private rooms. He hadn't minded other people so much when he was younger. But then to move to Class Twelve and be put into a room with just one other person, that had been the most painful of all, souring Quellen permanently.</p>
   <p>Marok had been a genuinely fine fellow, Quellen reflected. But he had jarred on Quellen's nerves, with his sloppiness and his unending visiphone calls and his constant presence. Quellen had longed for the day when he would reach Thirteen and live alone, no longer with a roommate as a constant check. He would be free—free to hide from the crowd.</p>
   <p>Did Koll know? He'd soon find out whether he did.</p>
   <p>The phone clicked. It was Brogg.</p>
   <p>"We have him," Brogg said. "We're on our way back."</p>
   <p>"Fine work, fine work."</p>
   <p>Quellen dialed Koll. "We've caught the man," he said. "Brogg and Mikken are bringing him back here for interrogation."</p>
   <p>"Good job," Koll said, and Quellen noted the trace of an honest smile flickering on the small man's lips. "I've just filled out a promotion form for you, by the way," he added casually. "It seems unfair to let the CrimeSec live in a Class Thirteen unit when he rates at least a Fourteen."</p>
   <p><emphasis>So he doesn't know after all,</emphasis>Quellen thought, Then another thought came: how could he move the illegal stat to new quarters without being detected? Perhaps Koll was only leading him deeper into a trap. Quellen pressed his palms against his temples and shivered, waiting, for Brogg, Mikken—and Lanoy.</p>
   <p>"You admit you've been sending people into the past?" Quellen demanded.</p>
   <p>"Sure," said the little man flippantly. Quellen watched him and felt an irrational pulse of anger go through him. "Sure. I'll send you back for two hundred creds.".</p>
   <p>Brogg stood with folded arms behind the little man, and Quellen faced him over the table.</p>
   <p>"You're Lanoy?"</p>
   <p>"That's my name." He was a small, dark, intense, rabbity sort of man, with thin lips constantly moving. "Sure, I'm Lanoy." The little man radiated a confident warmth. He sat with his legs crossed and his head thrown back.</p>
   <p>"It was pretty nasty the way your boys tracked me down," Lanoy said. "It was bad enough that you fooled that poor prolet into leading you to me, but they didn't need to rough me up. I'm not doing anything illegal, you know. I ought to sue."</p>
   <p>"You're disturbing the past thousand years!"</p>
   <p><strong>"</strong>I am not," Lanoy said calmly. "They've already been disturbed. I'm just seeing to it that past history takes place the way it took place, if you know what I mean."</p>
   <p>Quellen stood up, but found he had no room to move in the tiny office, and sat down again ineffectually. He felt strangely weak in the presence of the slyster.</p>
   <p>"But you're sending prolets back to become the hoppers. Why?</p>
   <p>Lanoy smiled. "To earn a living. Surely you understand that. I'm in possession of a very valuable process, and I want to make sure I get all I can out of it."</p>
   <p>"Did you invent time-travel?"</p>
   <p>"It doesn't matter," said Lanoy. "I control it."</p>
   <p>"Why don't you simply go back in time and steal or place bets to make a livingP</p>
   <p>"I could," Lanoy admitted. "But the process is irreversible, and there's no way of getting back to the present again. And I like it here, thank you."</p>
   <p>"Look, Lanoy," Quellen said. "I'll be frank: we want your time-travel gimmick, and we want it fast."</p>
   <p>"Sorry," said Lanoy. "Private property. You don't have any right to it."</p>
   <p>Quellen thought of Koll and Spanner, and got angry and frightened at the same time. "When I get through with you you'll wish you'd used your own machine and gone back a million years."</p>
   <p>Lanoy remained calm, and Quellen was surprised to see Brogg smiling. "Come now, CrimeSec," the slyster said. "You're starting to get angry, and that's always illogical."</p>
   <p>Quellen saw the truth of what Lanoy was saying, but he lost the struggle to calm himself. "Ill keep you under arrest until you rot," he threatened.</p>
   <p>"Now where will that get you?" Lanoy asked. "Would you mind giving me a little more oxy in here, please, by the way? I'm suffocating."</p>
   <p>In his astonishment Quellen opened the vent wide. Brogg registered surprise, and even Mikken blinked at Lanoy's breach of taste.</p>
   <p>"If you arrest me I'll break you, Quellen. There's nothing illegal in what I'm doing. Look here—I'm a registered slyster." Lanoy produced a card, properly stamped.</p>
   <p>Quellen didn't know what to say. Lanoy definitely had him on the run, he knew, and Brogg was enjoying his discomfiture immensely. Quellen chewed his hp, watching the little man closely, and wishing fervently that he were back beside his Congo stream throwing rocks at the crocodiles.</p>
   <p>"I'm going to put a stop to your time-travelling, anyway," Quellen finally said.</p>
   <p>Lanoy chuckled. "I wouldn't advise it, Quellen."</p>
   <p>"CrimeSec to you, Lanoy."</p>
   <p>"I wouldn't advise it, <emphasis>Quellen," </emphasis>Lanoy repeated. "If you cut off the hoppers now, you'll turn the past topsy-turvy. Those people went back. It's recorded in history. Some of them married and had children, and the descendants of those children are alive today. For all you know, Quellen, you may be the descendant of a hopper I'm going to send back next week—and if that hopper never gets back, Quellen, you'll pop out of existence like a snuffed candle. Sound like a pleasant way to die, CrimeSec?"</p>
   <p>Quellen stared glumly. Brogg stood silently behind Lanoy, and it became apparent to the CrimeSec now that the burly UnderSec had been gunning for Quellen's job all along, and that Lanoy was doing an effective job of eliminating the last stumbling-block in his way. Marok, Koll, Spanner, Brogg, and now Lanoy—they were all determined to see Quellen enmeshed. It was an unvoiced conspiracy. Silently he cursed the two hundred million jostling inhabitants of Appalachia, and wondered if he'd ever know a moment's solitude again.</p>
   <p>"The past won't be changed, Lanoy," he said. "Well lock you up, all right, and take away your machine, but we'll see to it ourselves that the hoppers go back. We're no fools, Lanoy. Well see to-it that everything stays as it is."</p>
   <p>Lanoy watched him almost with pity for a moment, as one might observe a particularly rare butterfly impaled on a mountingboard.</p>
   <p>"Is that your game, CrimeSec? Why didn't you tell me that before? In that case I'll have to take steps to protect myself."</p>
   <p>Quellen felt like hiding. "What are you going to do?"</p>
   <p>"Suppose we talk it over privately, Quellen," the slyster said. "I might say some things you wouldn't want your subordinates to hear."</p>
   <p>Quellen glanced at Brogg. "Have you searched him?"</p>
   <p>"He's clean," Brogg said. "Nothing to fear. We'll wait in the anteroom. Come on, Mikken."</p>
   <p>Ponderously, Brogg stalked out of the room, followed by the silent Mikken.</p>
   <p>With the occupants of the room numbering just two, Quellen moved to cut down the oxy vent.</p>
   <p>"Leave it up, Quellen," Lanoy said. "I like to breathe well at government expense."</p>
   <p>"What's your game?" Quellen asked. He was angry; Lanoy was a completely vicious creature who offended Quellen's pride and dignity.</p>
   <p>"I'll be blunt with you, CrimeSec," the slyster said. "I want my freedom, and I want to continue in business. I like it that way. That's what I want. You want to arrest me and take over my business. That's what you want. Right?"</p>
   <p>"Yes."</p>
   <p>"Now in a situation like that we have an interplay of mutually exclusive desires. So the stronger of the two forces wins—all the time. I'm stronger, and so you'll have to let me go and forget all about the investigation."</p>
   <p>"Who says you're stronger, Lanoy?"</p>
   <p>"I'm strong because you're weak. I know a lot of things about you, Quellen.,I know how you hate crowds and like fresh air and open spaces. These are pretty awkward idiosyncrasies to live with in a world like ours, aren't they?"</p>
   <p>"Go on," said Quellen, He cursed Brogg silendy—no one else could have revealed his secret to Lanoy.</p>
   <p>"So you're going to let me walk out of here, or else you'll find yourself back in a Class Twelve or Ten unit. You won't like it much there, CrimeSec. You'll have to share a room, and you may not like your room-mate, but there'll be nothing you can do. And when you have a room-mate, you won't be free to run away. He'll report you."</p>
   <p>"What do you mean, run away?" Quellen's voice was little more than a husky whisper.</p>
   <p>"I mean run away to Africa, Quellen."</p>
   <p>That was it, Quellen thought. Now it's over; Brogg's sold me down the river. With Lanoy in possession of Quellen's secret, Quellen was completely in the little slyster's power.</p>
   <p>"I hate to do this to you, Quellen. You're a pretty good sort, caught in a world you didn't make and don't especially like. But it's either you or me, and you know who always wins in deals like that."</p>
   <p>Check and mate.</p>
   <p>"Go ahead," Quellen whispered. "Get moving."</p>
   <p>"I knew you'd see it my way," Lanoy said. "I'll leave now. You don't interfere with me, and Koll won't ever know about your little shack."</p>
   <p>"Get out," Quellen said.</p>
   <p>Lanoy got up, saluted Quellen, and slipped out through the door.</p>

   <p>As Lanoy left, Koll entered. Quellen, his face in his hands, saw Koll out of the comer of one -eye and thought for a moment that it was Lanoy returning. Then he looked up.</p>
   <p>"I thought I'd have a look at your slyster," Koll said. "But I see he's not around."</p>
   <p>"I sent him inside," Quellen said weakly.</p>
   <p>"I'll check," said Koll. "I'm quite curious about him." He left, and Brogg entered.</p>
   <p>"Have a nice chat, CrimeSec?" Brogg asked, smiling. As always, the fat man's forehead was strung with a row of perspiration-beads.</p>
   <p>"Very nice, thank you." Quellen looked imploringly at his assistant. If only he could be left alone for a few moments!</p>
   <p>"He doesn't seem to be here any more, CrimeSec. I had a few questions for your friend Lanoy, but I can't find him."</p>
   <p>"I don't know where he went to, Brogg."</p>
   <p>Are you sure, now, CrimeSec? Where is he, Quellen?" he said maliciously.</p>
   <p>"I don't know." It was the first time Brogg had dropped the honorific in addressing Quellen. "Go away."</p>
   <p>Brogg smiled slyly and left, closing the door with care. Quellen sat in his penumochair, shaking his head from side to side. He was in for it now. If he failed to produce Lanoy, they'd have his neck. If he recaptured the little slyster, Lanoy would give the show away. Either way they had him.</p>
   <p>He tiptoed through the front office, where Brogg glared at him with evident interest, stepped out into the crowded street and caught the first quickboat back to his apartment. It was good to be alone again. He wandered around aimlessly for a moment, and then walked over to face the stat.</p>
   <p>All he had to do was step through it and he'd be back in Africa, by the side of the twisting stream and the crocodiles. No more job, but they'd never find him, and he could spend the rest of his days peacefully.</p>
   <p>No good, he thought dismally. It wasn't safe, with Brogg and Lanoy knowing. Between the two of them, they'd ferret him out quickly enough. Africa held no security.</p>
   <p>Besides, he felt a strange new feeling growing in him— a feeling that he was put upon, that he was a sort of martyr to overcrowding. He thrust his hands in his pocket and stood before the stat, revolving in his mind the implications of this new concept. A world he never made, Lanoy had said.</p>
   <p>All guilt dissolved. Let Koll unravel the mess to suit himself, Quellen thought.</p>
   <p>It was done.</p>
   <p>There was a swirling and a twisting and Quellen felt as if he had been turned inside-out and disembowelled. He was floating on a purple cloud high above some indistinct terrain, and he was falling.</p>
   <p>He dropped, heels over head, and landed in a scrambled heap on a long green carpet. He lay there for a moment or two, just holding on to the ground.</p>
   <p>A handful of the carpet tore off in his fist. He looked at it with a puzzled expression on his face.</p>
   <p>Crass.</p>
   <p>The clean smell of the air hit him next, almost as a physical shock. It smelled like a room with full oxy, but this was outdoors.</p>
   <p>Quellen gathered himself together and stood up. The grassy carpet extended in all directions, and in front of him there was a great thicket of trees.</p>
   <p>He had seen trees in Africa. There were none in Appalachia. He looked. A small gray bird came out on the overhanging branch of the nearest tree and began to chirp, unafraid, at Quellen. He smiled.</p>
   <p>He wondered how long Koll and Brogg would search for him, and whether Brogg would cope with Lanoy. He hoped not; Brogg was a scoundrel, and Lanoy, despite his slyster habits, was a gentleman.</p>
   <p>Quellen began to move toward the forest. He would have to locate a stream and build a house next to it, he decided. He could make the house as big as he wanted.</p>
   <p>He felt no guilt. He had been a misfit, thrown into a world he could only hate and which could only ensnarl him. Now he had his chance; it was all up to him.</p>
   <p>Two deer came bounding out of the forest. Quellen stood aghast. He had never seen animals that size. Happily, they skipped off into the distance.</p>
   <p>Quellen's heart began to sing as he filled his lungs with the sweet air. Marok, Koll, Spanner, Brogg. They began to fade and blur. Good old Lanoy, he thought. He'd kept his word after all.</p>
   <p><emphasis>The world is mine,</emphasis>Quellen thought. So now I'm a hopper, too—taking the longest hop of all.</p>
   <p>A tall, red-skinned man emerged from the forest and stood near a tree, regarding Quellen gravely. He was dressed in a leather belt, a pair of sandals, and nothing else, and in his hair was a decorative feather. The red-skinned man studied Quellen for a moment and then raised his arm in a gesture Quellen could not fail to interpret. A warm feeling of comradeship glowed in Quellen.</p>
   <p>Smiling at last, Quellen went forward to meet him, palm upraised.</p>
