   <p><strong>The Church at Monte Saturno</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>ROBERT SILVERBERG is a multiple winner of both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, and he was named a Grand Master by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America in 2004.</p>
   <p>He began submitting stories to science fiction magazines in his early teens, and his first published novel, a children’s book entitled <emphasis>Revolt on Alpha C,</emphasis> appeared 1955. He won his first Hugo Award the following year.</p>
   <p>Always a prolific writer—for the first four years of his career he reportedly wrote a million words a year— his numerous books include such novels as <emphasis>To Open the Sky, To Live Again, Dying Inside, Nightwings,</emphasis> and <emphasis>Lord Valentine’s Castle.</emphasis> The last became the basis for his popular “Majipoor” series, set on the eponymous alien planet, and he is currently putting together <emphasis>Tales of Majipoor,</emphasis> a collection of related stories that he has written over the past ten years.</p>
   <p>About the following tale, Silverberg says, “I wrote it soon after returning from a visit to Sicily, where nothing like this had happened to me.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>SERAFINA SAID, “You are English, no?”</p>
   <p>“American, actually,” Gardiner told her.</p>
   <p>“I would say English. The studious look. The glasses. The bad haircut. The way you dress. Like you have money but don’t think it’s nice to spend it. Very English, I think.”</p>
   <p>True enough. Only he wasn’t. And he had taken her at first glance for a simple Sicilian peasant girl, but obviously that was wrong also. There was nothing simple about her. Both of them, it seemed, had instantly invented imaginary identities for each other and were working their way backward now to the actual ones.</p>
   <p>“I’m a professor. An associate professor, actually. History of art.” Who had taught at three different universities in fourteen years, and still was only an associate professor. Who did not even have his doctorate. And now was roaming the edges of the classical world peering at Byzantine mosaics in the hope they would somehow rescue him. “Associate professors often tend to seem a little English. I dress like this because it’s what I can afford. It’s also very comfortable.”</p>
   <p>They were sitting under a gnarled old oak on a summer-parched brown hillside at the edge of the little town of Monte Saturno in central Sicily, looking southward into a steep gorge densely covered on both slopes with tough, leathery-looking grey-green shrubs. The sky was a hot iron dome, painted a pale blue. Even at this early hour of the day the air was stifling. Gardiner felt a little dizzy. This was a dizzying place, Sicily. The air, rich with lemon and herbs. The heat. The dark fissures of decay everywhere. The beauty. The taint of antiquity, the unfathomable mysteries lurking in every narrow alleyway, behind every crumbling façade.</p>
   <p>He had arrived in town late the night before, driving down from Palermo, and had known her for less than half an hour. He was just finishing breakfast at the little <emphasis>albergo</emphasis> where he was staying when she came in to chat with the proprietor, her uncle. Gardiner had lured her out for a stroll: past the low lopsided cathedral, the scruffy and padlocked municipal museum, the ancient windowless building that was the post office. Almost at once they were in the open countryside, staring out into the island’s immense empty hinterland. She was long and lean, nearly as tall as he was, with prominent cheekbones, a long sharp nose, dark penetrating eyes. She had been born in this village, she told him, but lived in Palermo and had spent considerable time in Rome; she had come here a few days before to visit her grandfather, who was ninety. Gardiner found her attractive, and also oddly forward, flirtatious. But of course he knew better than to indulge in any fantasies. This was Sicily, after all.</p>
   <p>“The history of art? You come to <emphasis>Sicily</emphasis> to study Italian art? There is some confusion here, I think. You should be in Florence, Venice, Rome.”</p>
   <p>“Not Italian art, especially. Byzantine. I’m writing a doctoral thesis on the transition from the Roman style of mosaic work to the Byzantine.” How tidy that sounded! But he hardly wanted to tell her that he had come to Italy seeking something that he could not define, that his life, though satisfying in some ways, seemed fundamentally static and insubstantial: that he yearned for a <emphasis>coup,</emphasis> a grand achievement that would establish him before the world. Serafina sat leaning towards him, listening intently, with her long legs crossed, her hands outstretched on her knees. “You understand what that is, a doctoral thesis?” he asked.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Capisco, si.”</emphasis> She was speaking mostly in English, which she handled well, though she dropped into Italian now and then for emphasis. Gardiner, fairly fluent in Italian, had begun the conversation in that language but something about her expression made him think that she found that condescending, and he had cut it out. She could be, he suspected, a prickly, difficult woman. “You write your thesis, they make you a <emphasis>dottore della filosofia,</emphasis> and then you become a real professor, that is how it works, no?”</p>
   <p>“A <emphasis>full</emphasis> professor.”</p>
   <p>“Ah. <emphasis>Si.</emphasis> So you are here to see our mosaics. Already you have seen the mosaics in Palermo? The Capella Palatina, the church of La Martorana, the cathedral at Monreale?”</p>
   <p>“All of them. Plus the one at Cefalu. They’re all later than the ones I’m studying, really, but how could I pass them up?” Gardiner loved mosaics with a powerful passion. Not for the religious scenes they depicted, which had no real importance or significance to him beyond an esthetic one. He was in no way a religious man. The holy saints and martyrs of the Christian mosaics and the gods and goddesses of the older, pagan ones were simply just so much mythology for him, quaint, mildly amusing. But the mosaics themselves—their plasticity of design, their glinting surfaces, their inner light—that was what excited him. It was nearly impossible for him to put his feelings into words: an almost sexual yearning, focused on bits of colored tile glued to walls. He was possessed, and he knew it.</p>
   <p>“And now?”</p>
   <p>“Today I’ll head down to Piazza Armerina, the Villa Romana, the palace of the Roman emperor. With absolutely wonderful mosaics.”</p>
   <p>“I have never been there,” she said.</p>
   <p>Never? That was odd. Piazza Armerina was, he calculated, no more than an hour’s drive away. But New Yorkers never went to the Statue of Liberty or Parisians to the Eiffel Tower, either. Gardiner toyed with the idea of inviting Serafina to accompany him.</p>
   <p>“From Piazza Armerina I’ll continue on south to Agrigento for a look at the Greek temples, and then up along the coast to Trapani, where I can catch the ferry for Tunis. The Bardo Museum in Tunis has one of the finest collections of mosaics in the world.” Into his mind now there sprang the wild notion of asking her to join him for the Tunisian expedition too, and he was startled by the sudden throbbing beneath his breastbone at the idea. On half an hour’s acquaintance, though? At best she would laugh; she might spit in his face. The old days of impenetrably guarded chastity might be gone here, but at the outset she would want him at least to pretend that he thought of her as a respectable woman. He looked guiltily away, as if fearing that his intentions were visible on his face.</p>
   <p>I should ask her now, he thought, about herself: where she went to school, what she does, how it happens that she speaks English so well. But he hesitated, momentarily unwilling to plod through the standard conversational gambits. A sharp silence fell between them. Gardiner heard the buzz and click of insects all around, and a peculiar ticking coming from a nearby tree, as though the heat were shrinking its bark. The sudden tension sharpened his senses, and he became aware of a tumult of Mediterranean scents assailing him on all sides, lavender, maybe, rosemary, the fragrance of prickly-pear blossoms and lemon leaves.</p>
   <p>A hawk drifted diagonally across the sky. Gardiner, idly following its path with his eyes, watched it descend abruptly into the gorge as if diving to seize a rabbit. His gaze traveled downward with the plunging hawk and he noticed for the first time what appeared to be a small isolated building on the far side of the valley, all but hidden in the scrubby brush. Not much more than the curving arc of its low white dome was visible. Something about the shape of that dome aroused his attention. He had seen buildings like that before. But not in Sicily.</p>
   <p>“What is that across the way?” he asked her, pointing.</p>
   <p>She knew what he meant. “A ruin. Not important.”</p>
   <p>His guidebook had said nothing about ruins in Monte Saturno. So far as he knew there was nothing of that sort here, neither Greek, Roman, Byzantine, nor Norman, none of the multitudinous layers upon layers of superimposed realities out of which this island was built. He had stopped here last night simply because he had had a late start out of Palermo and decided <emphasis>en route</emphasis> not to risk driving on into Piazza Armerina after dark on this rough country road. It had been pure luck that the town’s one <emphasis>trattoria</emphasis> maintained a few upstairs rooms for tourists passing through.</p>
   <p>“A church of some sort, is it?”</p>
   <p>“Of some sort, yes. Not Catholic. A Greek church, the Orthodox faith. Empty a long time. Not a holy place any more.”</p>
   <p>“Empty how long?”</p>
   <p>A shrug. “A long time?”</p>
   <p>“Five hundred years? A thousand?”</p>
   <p>“Who knows? But a long time. It is very ruined. Nobody goes there except goats. And young <emphasis>innamorati.</emphasis> You know, lovers looking for a place to be alone.”</p>
   <p>Gardiner felt a slow stirring of excitement.</p>
   <p>“A Greek church,” he said slowly. “Byzantine, you mean?”</p>
   <p>“That may be.” Serafina laughed. “Ah, you think there are mosaics there? You think you have made a great artistic discovery? There is nothing. Dirt. Ghosts.”</p>
   <p>“Ghosts?”</p>
   <p>“It is very haunted there. Yes.”</p>
   <p>She sounded almost serious. He had, for a moment, a sense that a door had opened into a dark place forever inaccessible to him and Serafina was standing on the far side of the threshold. He knew that many of the villagers here lived on the interface between modern civilization and that shadowy realm of antiquity that was beyond his understanding; but Serafina, he had thought, was entirely of his world. He saw now that he might have been wrong about that. But then she grinned and was a contemporary woman again.</p>
   <p>He said, forcing a grin of his own, “I’d be interested in seeing it, haunted or not. Is there any way of getting to it?”</p>
   <p>“A road. Very bad, very rough.”</p>
   <p>“Could you take me there? I very much would like to have a look at it.</p>
   <p>Anger flashed like summer lightning in her eyes. “Ah, you are so subtle, you <emphasis>inglesi!”</emphasis></p>
   <p>“American,” he said. And then, comprehending: “And you misunderstand me, if you think I’m trying in some roundabout fashion to engineer a rendezvous with you. <emphasis>Lei capisce,</emphasis> ‘rendezvous’?” She nodded. “But as long as I’m here—a Byzantine church that isn’t even in the guidebook—”</p>
   <p>Another eyeflash, this one more mischievous. She still seemed angry, but in a different way now.</p>
   <p>“Truly, <emphasis>Professore,</emphasis> you are interested only in the architecture of this dirty abandoned church? You take me to this rendezvous for lovers merely to see stone walls? Ah, I think I misjudge the kind of man you are. A beautiful woman means nothing to you, I think.”</p>
   <p>Gardiner sighed. He was caught in a no-win situation. Bluntness seemed the best tactic.</p>
   <p>“They mean a great deal. And you are extremely beautiful. But I know better than to proposition a <emphasis>Siciliana</emphasis> five minutes after I’ve met her, and in any case there’s a bed in my hotel room, if that’s what I was after. I don’t need to take you to an abandoned building full of goat shit and straw. But I would like to see the church. Honestly.”</p>
   <p>Serafina’s expression softened. She looked merely amused now.</p>
   <p>“You want to go?” she said. “Really? <emphasis>Allora.</emphasis> We go, then.”</p>
   <p>She snapped her fingers under his nose. “Come! Up! We get ready, we go, at once, <emphasis>subito!”</emphasis></p>
   <subtitle>~ * ~</subtitle>
   <p>But of course they didn’t go <emphasis>subito.</emphasis> Nothing ever happened <emphasis>subito</emphasis> in Sicily. They had to prepare themselves properly for the expedition, sturdy boots, jackets to ward off brambles, and wide-brimmed hats for the sun, plus a bottle of wine, some bread and cheese and salami and fruit, as if they were going on a long journey, not just down the side of one nearby hill and up another. The preparations mysteriously stretched on for hours. He had a suitable jacket and even a hat but no hiking boots, only sneakers, which Serafina glanced at with contempt. Her cousin Gino would lend him a pair of boots.</p>
   <p>Cousin Gino was twenty-three or so, sullenly handsome, a swarthy, bull-necked bushy-haired man with enormous forearms and bright, fierce eyes, unexpectedly blue in this land of dark-eyed people. Though Gardiner was a big man himself, broad-shouldered and ruggedly athletic of build, who looked more like a football coach than an assistant professor of the history of art, it appeared likely to him that in any kind of fight Gino would twirl him around his wrist like spaghetti. And just now Gino was glowering at Gardiner with what looked very much like unconcealed hostility, bringing to mind all of Gardiner’s stereotyped notions of the way the men of this island defended their women’s chastity. Serafina said something to him in the transmogrified and deformed dialect of Italian, both clipped and slurred, that was Sicilian—a patois which Gardiner found utterly opaque. Gino, replying with an equally unintelligible stream of brusque, sputtering words, gave them both a furious glare and went whirling away from them.</p>
   <p>“What’s bothering him?” Gardiner asked, still inventing Gino’s proprietary rage, imagining dire warnings, threats of vendetta.</p>
   <p>“He says your feet are too big, they will stretch his boots.”</p>
   <p>“That’s all?” Gardiner felt something close to disappointment. “Well, tell him not to worry. If anything, his feet look bigger than mine.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe yes, maybe no. He will get the boots anyway, he said. As a special favor for me. We are very good friends, Gino and I.”</p>
   <p>The image came unbidden to Gardiner’s mind of Serafina and her brutish cousin, over there across the gorge one languid summer night seven or eight years ago, lying naked in each other’s arms, ferociously entwined in the incestuous embraces that he assumed were altogether customary among the rural adolescents of this backward country. He doubted that any such thing had ever happened between them; but if it had, no wonder Gino was pissed off over her taking this <emphasis>straniero</emphasis> to their special place, and in his own best boots, yet.</p>
   <p>Gardiner smiled at his own foolishness. He was capable of engendering an ethnic cliche for any occasion. It was a habit, he told himself, that he needed to break.</p>
   <p>Eventually Gino came back with a pair of huge clodhoppers dangling from one immense hand. To Gardiner’s surprise, and apparently Gino’s, the boots were a perfect fit.</p>
   <p>It was a little before noon when they finally set out. The sun filled half the sky, blazing like a permanent atomic explosion, and the hot, shimmering air was full of madly dancing bugs that sang manic droning songs in his ears. There was a sort of a road at first, but it morphed into a narrow untidy trail after a few hundred yards and then, a little while later, became nothing more than a faint exiguous track through the dry stiff-branched chaparral.</p>
   <p>Despite the heat and the difficulties of the route, long-legged Serafina set a brisk pace. Gardiner kept up with her without much effort, but he was marinating in his own sweat under the jacket that she had insisted he wear. At the bottom of the Monte Saturno side of the gorge they came to a campsite, a flat rock and a fire pit and enough discarded wine bottles to keep future archaeologists amused for centuries, and she said crisply, “We make the lunch here.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Va bene.”</emphasis> He welcomed the break. The climb ahead looked formidable.</p>
   <p>Serafina assembled sandwiches while he opened the wine. As they ate and drank she offered snippets of autobiography. She had lived here until she was sixteen, she told him, and then was taken away to Rome by her uncle, not the same one who owned the <emphasis>trattoria,</emphasis> to be educated. There was a bit of extra spin about the way she said “uncle” and “educated,” and Gardiner flamboyantly hypothesized all manner of sinister iniquities, sone wealthy waxed-mustachioed stranger buying the beautiful girl from her impoverished parents to be put to the most depraved uses in his elegant baroque apartment overlooking the Spanish Stairs. But she talked instead of learning English at a genteel Roman academy whose name meant nothing to Gardiner but sounded quite elite: then a stint in the Roman office of a big British investment bank; an affair, apparently, with a young British bond trader that brought her a transfer to the London office, a dizzying taste of the international high life, and, so she appeared to be saying, the inevitable accidental pregnancy and concomitant mess, letdown, and heartbreak. Her fair-haired bond trader operated out of Prague now and she, having had her fill of banking, worked at the Hertz Rent-a-Car office in Palermo. She was fluent in English, French, Spanish, and German, as well as Italian and the local dialect. So much for her being a simple peasant girl, he thought. He guessed that she was around twenty-nine. He was nine years older. In the thick afternoon warmth the aura of her lean, sleek Mediterranean attractiveness expanded into the hazy air around him, dazzling and mesmerizing him, enveloping him in an unexpected and astonishing explosion of impulsive speculation. How it would startle everyone at the college, Gardiner told himself, if he came back from his summer research trip not only with material for his thesis but with a beautiful and cosmopolitan Italian wife!</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Andiamo,”</emphasis> she said, the moment the bottle was empty. “Now I show you the fabulous Byzantine church.”</p>
   <p>The hill on the southern side of the gorge was steep, all right, and the heat was unthinkable now, and Serafina moved with jackrabbit energy up the slope, as though deliberately testing his endurance; but, fortified by the good red wine of Monte Saturno and his own implacable curiosity about the ruin ahead and now, also, this absurd but amusing new bit of romantic fancy of his, he matched her step for step, a couple of yards behind her with his gaze fixed steadily on the taut, tantalizing seat of her jeans.</p>
   <p>Suddenly they were in a little scraggly clearing, and the ruined church lay right in front of them.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Ecco</emphasis>,” she said. “Behold your heart’s desire.”</p>
   <p>The building was a little one, no bigger than a garage and half concealed in tangles of brush, but it was pure late-Byzantine in form, a squared-off Greek cross of a structure with a squat dome perched atop its four blocky walls. He knew of no other building of this sort in Sicily. It reminded him of nothing so much as the 11th-century church at Daphni, outside Athens. But Daphni was world-famous for its luminous mosaics.</p>
   <p>It was impossible, Gardiner thought, that mosaics like those of Daphni could have gone unnoticed all this time, even in this obscure hilltop village.</p>
   <p>“Let’s go in,” he said hoarsely.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Si, si.”</emphasis> She beckoned to him. <emphasis>“Venga di qua.”</emphasis></p>
   <p>The main entrance was sealed by a dense barrier of interwoven woody shrubs, but a smaller door stood slightly ajar on the northern side, a crudely made wooden one, cracked and crazed, that looked as though it had been tacked on about a hundred years ago by some farmer using this place as a barn. Serafina, with a surprising show of strength, levered it open just far enough to let them slip inside.</p>
   <p>The church was rank, musty, dismal, a claustrophobe’s nightmare. When Gardiner switched on his flashlight he saw that over the centuries enough sandy dirt had blown in through the narrow window-grates and through crevices in the walls to lift the floor level at least eight feet in most places, so that he was standing practically within arm’s reach of the dome. Heaps of ancient mildewed straw were piled everywhere: a barn, yes. The pungent aroma of innumerable copulations hovered in the air. For how many generations had the passionate young of Monte Saturno committed sins of the flesh in this bedraggled former house of God?</p>
   <p>He aimed his beam upward, praying that he would see the stark somber face of Christ the Pantocrator scowling down at him, as at Daphni and other Byzantine churches. No. The dome was bare. He had not really expected anything else. Probably this had been some simple chapel for wayfarers, in use for perhaps fifty years a thousand years ago, then abandoned, forgotten.</p>
   <p>“You are satisfied?” Serafina asked.</p>
   <p>“I suppose.”</p>
   <p>“I myself parted with my virtue here,” she said, in a bold, cool, self-mocking tone. He looked at her, taken aback, angered and repelled by her unsolicited revelation. The idea that Serafina had ever engaged in any sexual event in this grim squalid place was sickening to him. She and some clumsy village Romeo sprawling on a scratchy tick-infested blanket, his shaggy eager body pressing down on hers, her splendid slender legs spraddled wide, toes pointed at the dome: the thrusts, the grunts, the gasps. “I was fifteen. We thought we were being very brave coming here, because of the ghosts. But every young couple in town is brave like that when the time comes. Some things are so urgent that even ghosts are unimportant. The ghosts must be defied.”</p>
   <p>Gardiner shook his head. “Ghosts?” he muttered, roaming the edges of the building, scuffing at the mounded straw. That door into the unknown opening again. This damned island, he thought: level after level of superstition, evil, and madness. You were forever toppling down through the detritus of all its many occupiers to the jolting incomprehensibilities beneath.</p>
   <p>He was no good at dealing with such stuff. It forever amazed him when he came running up against some apparently rational person’s firmly held belief in the irrational, the impossible, the altogether inexplicable. For Gardiner there was nothing inexplicable, only phenomena that had not yet been properly explained; anything that seemed to be truly and eternally inexplicable was, he suspected, something that had either been badly misinterpreted or had simply never in fact occurred.</p>
   <p>He prodded and kicked at the ground along the perimeter of the building with the tip of Gino’s boot. “Who was the lucky boy?” he asked, after a time, amazed at himself for keeping the distasteful subject open.</p>
   <p>“Does it matter?” she said. “His name was Calogero. He is dead now.”</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry,” said Gardiner automatically. He continued to kick and scuff. Then came a surprise. “Hold on. What’s this?”</p>
   <p>A forehead of glistening tile was showing along the wall, just at the debris line. He dropped to his knees and scrabbled at it, hurling handfuls of sand behind him. Other things came into view. Eyebrows. Eyes. A serene face, nearly complete; a halo. He trembled. There was a mosaic here after all.</p>
   <subtitle>~ * ~</subtitle>
   <p>“It is not easy to believe,” she said, as they made their way wearily back to town at dusk after a long breathless afternoon of clearing away debris. “All those years, and those beautiful things on the wall, and no one ever thought to look under the dirt, until you.”</p>
   <p>Gardiner barely heard her. He was lost in a feverish dream of academic triumph. There would be articles in the journals; there would be a book; he would waltz to his doctorate. The mosaics were not of the first rank, hardly that, but they were undeniably late-Byzantine, a continuous band of them that circled the walls just below the surface of the intrusive fill, saints and pilgrims and Biblical figures in bright, intense reds and greens and golds and blacks. The tesserae, the bits of colored glass out of which the mosaic patterns were fashioned, were large and crude and not always perfectly fitted together—this was not Monreale or Cefalu, not Ravenna’s San Vitale, not the Keriye Djami in Istanbul—and the figures were awkward and often poorly arranged; but there was a purity about them, an innocence, that made them very beautiful in their own less sophisticated manner.</p>
   <p>Schemes, plans, were swiftly unfolding now. He would use his meager funds to hire workmen in town; he would clear out all the fill; he would photograph, he would analyze, he would compare and contrast, he would publish, he would publish, he would publish—</p>
   <p>As he and Serafina entered the town’s central <emphasis>piazza</emphasis> Gardiner saw that the entire population had turned out, making the nightly promenade, families moving in clustered groups, old men walking arm in arm, young couples holding hands. Some glanced at them, smiling. It seemed to him that everyone was remarking knowingly on their dusty, sweaty look, speculating vividly, lubriciously, on what they had been up to all afternoon in the church across the gorge. And not one with any idea of the truth.</p>
   <p>Gardiner had been thinking of inviting her into the <emphasis>trattoria</emphasis> for a celebratory dinner, candles and a fine bottle of red Regeleali <emphasis>riserva </emphasis>with the meal, and then, perhaps, a night of glorious celebratory delights upstairs: all the way back, he had seen that as a natural and inevitable sequel to the day’s triumphant events. But here in town he perceived instantly the impossibility of any such thing. Sweep her grandly into the inn with everybody watching, his carnal notions as manifest to all as if he had exposed himself in the street, and she not to be seen again until morning? Hardly. Whatever destiny awaited him with this woman, and Gardiner was convinced now that some sort of destiny did, it would not be consummated in this tiny and hermetic village. Not tonight, at any rate, virtually in public, as it were.</p>
   <p>She appeared to have figured all that out long before him. “Well,” she said, hardly pausing a moment outside the little inn before turning away, “I congratulate you on your good fortune. I am happy to have been of service.” She touched the tips of her fingers to his, and then she was gone, walking in long strides across the <emphasis>piazza</emphasis> to greet a pair of hatchet-faced old women who were clad in the traditional somber costume of an earlier era.</p>
   <p>There was no bath in his room, only a washbasin. Gardiner stripped, quickly splashed himself clean, lay down on the creaking bed to reflect on the day’s achievement and perhaps enjoy a little repose. Instantly he was asleep. When he woke, with a start, it was past ten. He dressed hastily. As he descended the stairs, he met someone coming upward, a sturdy-looking, black-bearded, youngish man in a priest’s black robe, who smiled and saluted him when they passed each other. So the <emphasis>albergo</emphasis> had acquired a new guest during the day. Two guests at once: a booming tourist season for them, Gardiner supposed.</p>
   <p>The <emphasis>padrona</emphasis> was in the dining room, reading a newspaper. She seemed untroubled by his tardiness, and immediately went about putting together dinner for him, pasta with sardines, some roasted pork, a carafe of the red <emphasis>vino di casa.</emphasis> “It was a good day for you?” she asked.</p>
   <p>“Fine. Splendid.” His glow could leave no doubt.</p>
   <p>“You stay here tomorrow?”</p>
   <p>“Certainly. Even past tomorrow.”</p>
   <p>This time, when he settled down on his bed again after dinner, sleep was impossible for a long time. He stared up at the low fly-specked ceiling and saw mosaics on the screen of his wearied mind, stylized mosaic figures, angels, patriarchs, sheep, frolicking dogs. It was too good to be true: much too good. Perhaps he had imagined the whole thing. The heat, the wine, the enchanting proximity of Serafina—</p>
   <p>No. No. No. No. They bad really been there. His discovery, his mosaics. He had touched them with his own hands. Felt their smooth shining surfaces.</p>
   <p>He slept, finally. It was a night of strange frightening dreams, masked figures dancing around him as he lay strapped to a smoldering pyre in the middle of the <emphasis>piazza.</emphasis></p>
   <p>At nine he awakened, breakfasted downstairs on cheese and figs and rolls, and peered out into the town square, which was utterly empty except for a couple of elderly dogs. He had no idea where Serafina was and felt uncomfortable about asking; and in any case he and she had made no arrangements for today. He equipped himself with his hat, his jacket, and Gino’s ponderous boots, and tucked a bottle of wine from the display on the dining room table into his backpack, along with enough rolls and cheese and fruit to last him through lunch, and, armed with flashlight, notebook, camera, went capering off alone towards the ravine.</p>
   <subtitle>~ * ~</subtitle>
   <p>He dug all morning, using as his shovel a slab of grey slate that was lying in the clearing outside the church. As the layer of loose fill retreated, and he laid bare more and wore of the band of mosaic ornament that rimmed the walls, Gardiner grew increasingly excited by his find. The work was on the crude side, yes, but it had a raw power that marked it as an important stylistic mode in its own right. The background in particular was an intense bluish white, giving the newly exposed parts of the wall a fierce brilliance that flamed wondrously as the sun came slanting occasionally in through the narrow windows and the cracks in the dome, fading when it moved along. Each moment of brightness was the occasion for a hasty flurry of photographs, and soon all his film was gone. It was a giddy, magical few hours.</p>
   <p>He postulated some 10th or 11th-century craftsman traveling down from Palermo, perhaps to do a job of interior decoration at some baron’s palazzo along the island’s south shore, being inveigled <emphasis>en route</emphasis> into spending a few weeks touching up this little chapel. And really getting into it, seeing it as an opportunity to experiment with an individual style of work, perhaps slipping into a little romantic entanglement with one of the town girls that gave him motivation to linger a little while longer, now a real labor of love, so that months went by, maybe even a year or two of solitary toil, preparing the little colored cubes and painstakingly mortaring them into place, his own private masterpiece. All too soon to be forgotten, the building allowed to go derelict, a habitation for donkeys, the brilliant mosaics covered in time by an accretion of wind-blown rubble many feet deep.</p>
   <p>There was more than a thesis to be had here. There was an entire scholarly reputation.</p>
   <p>At midday, unable to move another molecule of dirt, Gardiner slipped outside into the stupefying heat for his wine and cheese. As soon as he had finished, sleep came over him, in an instant, as though a thick velvet curtain had been dropped on him.</p>
   <p>Awakening just as instantly some ninety minutes later, he went back into the church and beheld something so bewildering that his mind could not at first encompass it, and he thought he might still be dreaming. But he knew that he had to be awake. The evidence of physical sensation was compelling. The heavy, shimmering, almost tangible air, the penetrating heat, the myriad musty pungent smells left behind by vanished centuries: all of that was too vividly real.</p>
   <p>And the mosaics had undergone a bizarre transformation. The saints had grown leering faces with forked tongues, and their haloes glowed and pulsated with a neon fury. The peasants tending their flocks had been rearranged into obscene configurations, and looked back jeeringly over their shoulders at him while buggering bat-winged monstrosities. Placid sheep and bounding dogs had been replaced by grotesque reptilian horrors. Colors everywhere clashed garishly.</p>
   <p>Impossible.</p>
   <p>Impossible.</p>
   <p>There was no conceivable explanation for this. Gardiner was shaken, stunned. He felt physically ill. A wild vertigo assailed him. Numbed, half dazed, his heart racing wildly, he backed out of the building, cautiously returned, looked again. Monsters, nightmares, abominations. Frightful sights, all. But what frightened him more than the ghastliness on the walls was the feeling of utter destabilization that whirled through him, the sense that his mind had lost its moorings. He had never experienced any kind of dislocation like this. Never.</p>
   <p>He fought himself into calmness. It must be the heat, Gardiner told himself carefully. He had to be hallucinating. His photographs would show the truth.</p>
   <p>With unsteady hands he lifted his camera, remembering only after the shutter’s first click that he had used up all his film. He shrugged. For a long moment he stood staring at the hideous things on the walls.</p>
   <p>All I need now, he thought, is for one of them to wink at me.</p>
   <p>All I need—</p>
   <p>Abruptly all his hard-won calmness dissolved and something close to panic overcame him.</p>
   <p>Turning, he fled down the side of the gorge, ran with superhuman energy up the far side into town, arriving panting and dizzied, and found Serafina on the porch of her grandparents’ decrepit old stone house behind the post office. “Come with me,” he said. “The mosaics—I was just there, and they looked all <emphasis>changed.</emphasis> You’ve got to come and tell me it isn’t so.”</p>
   <p>“Changed?”</p>
   <p>“Into something horrible. Monsters and demons all over the wall. I couldn’t believe it.”</p>
   <p>“Ah,” she said, smiling amiably, a calm knowing smile as old as Zeus. “So the ghosts are at work.”</p>
   <p>Gardiner felt a shiver run along his back. The ghosts, again.</p>
   <p>“It was the ghosts, yes,” he said harshly. “Or the heat making me crazy. Or something I ate. Whatever it is, you’ve got to go back there with me. To check those mosaics out with your own eyes. I need to prove to myself that I didn’t actually see what I saw. Will you come? Right now?”</p>
   <p>She hesitated only a beat. “Yes,” she said, still looking more amused than anything else. “Of course.”</p>
   <p>This time he led the way. It was the hottest part of the afternoon; but Gardiner was in the grip of a crazy adrenaline surge, and moved so quickly that Serafina was hard-pressed to match his speed.</p>
   <p>He entered the church first and switched on his flashlight, bracing himself for the worst. But what he saw were the scenes he had uncovered that morning. Benign golden-haloed saints, looking back at him with gazes of sappy medieval sanctity. Smiling dull-eyed shepherds stood amidst their patient sheep. Innocent dogs performed mindless leaps. He was limp with relief.</p>
   <p>Serafina, following him in, glanced around at the mosaics, and said, smiling, “Yes, well, so tell me: where are all these horrible things?”</p>
   <p>Gardiner peered at the walls, baffled.</p>
   <p>“I swear, Serafina, I was absolutely certain that they were there. A completely convincing hallucination, as real as—as real as these walls. The saints had turned into demons. The farm animals had become monsters. The colors—”</p>
   <p>She gave him a queer look. “You drank a whole bottle of wine with your lunch, yes? And slept in the sun. And then you dreamed. Ah, yes, yes, <emphasis>caro,</emphasis> a very bad dream. Which the oh-so-devilish ghosts of this place playfully put into your sleeping mind to perplex you. Look, look, there are no monsters here. It would be a good story if there were, but there are not. They are very pretty, your mosaics, I think.”</p>
   <p>Yes. Yes, they were. Gentle scenes, lovely, innocuous.</p>
   <p>Perplexed indeed, altogether lost in bewilderment, Gardiner said almost nothing while they trudged back to town. Already that panoply of monsters was becoming unreal to him. But what he could not put aside was his conviction that he had, at least for a moment, truly seen those things with his own sober eyes, though he knew, <emphasis>knew</emphasis> that it was impossible that he had.</p>
   <p>As they came up the path into the <emphasis>piazza</emphasis> Serafina said, “You should take the Greek priest over to see the church. He will find it a very exciting surprise.”</p>
   <p>“Who?”</p>
   <p>“Father Demetrios. He is Eastern Orthodox, of the Martorana church in Palermo. He is visiting here since yesterday.”</p>
   <p>Gardiner recalled, now, the other guest at the hotel, the black-bearded young priest of the night before.</p>
   <p>An <emphasis>Orthodox</emphasis> priest, though? The Greek rite? All thoughts of ghosts and monsters, and of his own possibly wobbling sanity, fled from Gardiner at once. He was seized by sudden overmastering practical fear. The priest, if he found out about the mosaics, would surely claim the derelict church on behalf of his sect and take control of any scholarly use of the art within it. Gardiner would be shut out, his rights of discovery overridden by the assertion of the higher right of prior ownership.</p>
   <p>“No,” he said. “I’d rather not show the mosaics to anybody just yet. You haven’t already told him about them, have you?”</p>
   <p>“No,” she said, “of course not.”</p>
   <p>Was she telling the truth? There was something almost petulant about that <emphasis>of course,</emphasis> and something ambivalent about the shake of the head.</p>
   <p>The town square was deserted. The villagers were still enjoying their siesta, the whole town torpid in the late-day heat. Serafina accompanied him as far as the porch of his inn, and lingered there a moment, long enough for him to wonder whether he should invite her upstairs. But even now, with no one to spy on them, it felt somehow inappropriate, even sordid, to make such an overture to her out of the blue. Their frantic jog over to the ruin had hardly been a proper romantic prelude, and his strange hallucination, his babbling account of imagining that he had witnessed a demonic transformation of the mosaics, left him feeling abashed and demeaned now. He offered no invitation.</p>
   <p>“Well, then, <emphasis>ciao, amico.</emphasis> I will be seeing you,” she added formally, and turned away.</p>
   <p>Was that a touch of disappointment in her tone? So it seemed to him, for a moment. But it was too late to call her back. Already, moving swiftly as always, she was halfway across the <emphasis>piazza.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Gardiner went to his room, rinsed himself perfunctorily, unloaded his camera and buried the roll of film deep in his suitcase. For a long time he sat by his fly-specked window, staring into the square below, pondering many strangenesses. It was half past seven, now; the day was cooling, the townsfolk were coming forth for their pre-dinner stroll.</p>
   <p>Without warning, a desperate reckless desire to see the mosaics again, to confirm the reality of them, overcame him. He seized his camera and in a few minutes found himself once more laboring down the now-familiar path into the gorge.</p>
   <p>In the greyness of early evening he saw what he took to be bats flitting about the little domed church. Brushing impatiently past them, Gardiner marched inside, grim-faced, and cast his flashlight beam on the walls.</p>
   <p>The mosaics were in nightmare mode again. Everything was fangs, claws, tentacles, jutting swollen penises, jagged blurts of discordant color.</p>
   <p>He felt like sobbing. Why did the damned things keep oscillating in this maddening way? Why couldn’t they keep to one form or the other?</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Serafina!”</emphasis> he howled, as if expecting her to be able to hear him across the canyon. “It’s happened again!”</p>
   <p>This time he had had no wine. The day’s heat had relented. He believed himself to be sane. What explanation could there be for this?</p>
   <p>There was none. He was staring into the abyss of the incomprehensible.</p>
   <p>Waves of nausea went sweeping through him. He was trembling, and his teeth were chattering, which was something he could not remember having experienced ever before, that convulsive spastic movement of his jaws, that terrible eerie clacking of his teeth. He steadied himself with an immense effort. This must be recorded, he thought. Yes. Yes. Aiming his camera at the ghastliest of the designs, Gardiner pressed and pressed again, but the flash attachment would not operate. He had no idea why. Fear gave way to rage. He spat, slapped the camera, pressed once more. Nothing. Fumblingly he took some photos by flashlight illumination alone, knowing they would never come out.</p>
   <p>He gave the things on the wall one long last hard look. Then he turned and ran from the building, struggling at every step through the tangled knots of brambles that blocked the path and were so much harder to see, this late in the day. He moved like a machine, never pausing. A void had taken possession of his mind; it was empty now of all thought, all speculation. He dared not even try to think.</p>
   <p>Darkness had fallen when he entered the town. His legs were aching mercilessly from the uphill run. His powerful thighs, of which he was so proud, the product of endless miles of dawn jogging, throbbed with pain. As he rounded the corner by the museum, a figure stepped out of the shadows and struck him a terrible blow in the stomach. His eyeglasses went flying. Astounded, Gardiner staggered back, doubling over, gagging and choking and reeling, though in some reflexive way he managed to put his fists up anyway to ward off another punch.</p>
   <p>It was Gino, Serafina’s cousin. He loomed over Gardiner, swollen with wrath, rocking from side to side as he prepared his next swing. His blue eyes were ablaze with rage. Gardiner slapped at the balled fist confronting him.</p>
   <p>“Hey, hold it,” he said. “I’ll give you back your goddamn boots, if that’s what you want.”</p>
   <p>“It is not the boots,” said Gino venomously, speaking remarkably precise Italian now. He swung again. Gardiner pivoted so that he took the punch on the meaty part of his left arm instead of in the middle of his chest. It went through him like a bolt of electricity.</p>
   <p>He could not remember when he had last been in a fistfight: not since he was twelve, most likely. But he was no weakling. He would fight back, if he had to. Automatically he dropped into a boxer’s crouch and weave, and when Gino swung again he ducked and threw a punch of his own, which Serafina’s cousin batted away with a contemptuous swipe, as though he were swatting at a mosquito. Gino’s next punch caught Gardiner just below his right clavicle, landing with thunderbolt force and sending him sprawling to the ground.</p>
   <p>Through a mist of pain and humiliation he became aware that Serafina had emerged from somewhere and was pounding her fists furiously against Gino’s chest. <emphasis>“Pazzo</emphasis>!” she cried. “<emphasis>Cretino! Imbecile!”</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Tell him I’m finished with his precious boots,” Gardiner muttered feebly.</p>
   <p>“The boots are not the issue,” she said, in English. “He is enraged because you have not slept with me. Because you have rejected me two nights twice.”</p>
   <p>Gardiner, still on the ground, gaped. “What the hell are you saying? I thought Sicilian men were supposed to <emphasis>defend</emphasis> the honor of their women, not to—”</p>
   <p>“It is because he thinks you think you are too good for me. He wants you to take me to bed, and then he will make you marry me, and you will settle a fortune on the entire family, because you are American and Americans are rich. In his mind it is my job to seduce you. In this, he believes, I have failed, and so he is angered.” Serafina extended her hand to Gardiner and pulled him to his feet. “Angered with you,” she said, “not me. Of me he is afraid.” She turned to Gino, standing to one side like a fettered ox, and unleashed on him a torrent of fiery Sicilian. Gardiner was unable to understand a word of it. When at last she fell silent, Gino went slinking wordlessly away into the night.</p>
   <p>“Come,” she said, picking up Gardiner’s glasses and handing them to him. Still befogged, he put them in his shirt pocket. “Are you badly hurt?”</p>
   <p>“Nothing broken. Only bent.”</p>
   <p>She led him into the <emphasis>albergo,</emphasis> pausing at the bar to pick up a bottle of grappa. Upstairs, in his room, she poured a drink for him, helped him get his backpack off, gently probed his chest and shoulders for damage. “You will live,” she said, and measured out some grappa for herself. “Gino is very stupid, but he means well. I apologize on his behalf.” Then, with a sly smile: “You are much more handsome without your glasses, <emphasis>Professore.</emphasis> A strong face, like a Roman emperor, hard, virile. All beveled planes and stony angles. The glasses destroy your face completely, do you know?” She was wearing a thin green cardigan and a flimsy purple skirt, and now she began to unbutton the cardigan. “You do not have to marry me, only to be nice,” she said. “You went to the mosaics again tonight?”</p>
   <p>“Yes.”</p>
   <p>“And?”</p>
   <p>“What I saw—it makes no sense, Serafina. They’d gone all strange again.” He felt abashed even to say such a thing. “I’m sorry. That’s how they were.”</p>
   <p>“The ghosts have you in their grip,” she said. “I am sorry for you for that. But come. Lie down with me. You want to, don’t you?” She was narrow through the hips and small-bottomed, not at all Italian that way, and her arms and shoulders were almost distressingly thin, but her breasts were agreeably full. They stayed in his room for two hours. The bed was too small for two, and creaked loudly enough to be heard all over town, but they coped, and coped well. In the close humid atmosphere of the little room Gardiner forgot entirely the pain of Gino’s punches and, in Serafina’s arms, even for a time succeeded in exorcising the nightmarish threat to his sense of his own sanity that his most recent visit to the ruined church had awakened in him.</p>
   <p>Afterward they went downstairs. The <emphasis>padrone</emphasis> and his wife appeared to have gone to sleep, but Serafina went into the kitchen of the trattoria and put together a dinner for the two of them out of whatever she could find there, some leftover pasta with anchovies and a cold shoulder of lamb and a platter of broiled tomatoes and garlicky mushrooms, along with what was left in several open bottles of wine. When they had eaten Gardiner asked her to go back up to his room with him again, but this time she declined with a polite smile, explaining it would not be wise for her to stay the night with him. “Until tomorrow,” she said. “And you should not go to the church again alone. <emphasis>Buona notte, cam.” </emphasis>Blew him a fingertip kiss and was gone.</p>
   <p>This has been a very weird day, Gardiner thought.</p>
   <subtitle>~ * ~</subtitle>
   <p>In the morning, as he was finishing breakfast, Serafina appeared at the <emphasis>albergo</emphasis> and said, “Let us make another visit to your mosaics. I still would like to see them, these horrors of yours.”</p>
   <p>“Most likely they’ll have changed back overnight,” Gardiner said, almost jauntily. “But let’s go anyway.” He realized that he was becoming obsessed by the improbability of all this: an encounter with the absurd, his very first. There was a certain charm to its very inexplicability, even. But behind the charm lay something truly scary that would not relinquish its hold on him: the terrifying possibility that the hinges of his mind had begun to loosen. It was either that or ghosts, and he had never been very successful at believing in ghosts.</p>
   <p>He was stiff and sore, not only from Gino’s onslaught but from all of yesterday’s running to and fro, and Serafina had to pause several times to wait for him to catch up as they crossed the valley. But at last they were at the church. “Let me go in first,” he said grandly, which brought the sly knowing smile from her once again. She waved him forward.</p>
   <p>He expected everything to be normal again, that they would see nothing more than gentle pastoral scenes. But no—no, almost with gratitude he saw that the walls of the chapel this morning were still full of terrifying hideosities. But they were different ones from last night’s. Today’s carnival of abominations featured savage, carnivorous things with rows of red glaring eyes; extraterrestrial-looking, spindly headed satyrs in full spate; pious pilgrims with melting slimy faces. Hieronymus Bosch on acid. He was surprised at how little dismay he felt. He was becoming almost resigned to these metamorphoses, he thought. The trick was not to search for explanations. “Take a look,” he called hoarsely to her. She came in and stood for a moment by his side as he shined his beam here and there and there. He heard her soft little gasp: plainly, she had not really expected to see the things that she was seeing here now. She slipped her arm through his and pressed close against him, shivering. When he attempted once more to take photographs, the flash attachment again refused to function.</p>
   <p>“This is the work of demons,” Serafina said, in a tone an octave deeper than normal. <emphasis>“Andiamo! Fuori!”</emphasis> They went swiftly outside. With a visibly shaky hand she crossed herself three times. All that ballsy cosmopolitan pizzazz had been stripped from her in an instant; she was a country girl again, and a terrified one. “You should tell Father Demetrios about this right away,” she said. Her eyes were wide rigid disks.</p>
   <p>“Why?”</p>
   <p>“This church formerly belonged to his faith. It is his responsibility to drive these things away.</p>
   <p>“To—drive them away—?”</p>
   <p>She was talking about an exorcism, this very modern young Sicilian woman. Gardiner stared. Moment by moment he could feel himself being drawn backward into the opaque, inscrutable medieval past.</p>
   <p>She said, as though explaining to a child, “You and I both saw saints and shepherds here yesterday afternoon, but in the morning and the evening, alone, you saw monsters. This morning, the monsters are still there, and now I see them too. So we are both hallucinating or else it is real, and I do not think we are hallucinating. It is easier for me to believe in demons than in shared hallucinations.”</p>
   <p>“I suppose.”</p>
   <p>“Look, strange things have occurred in this church for many years. Although not like this, not that I have ever heard. It is a serious thing, this deception in a place that once was holy. If nothing is done to cure it, who can say what harm might befall to others who come here?”</p>
   <p>“Let me think about all this a little.”</p>
   <p>“What is there to think?”</p>
   <p>The unreality of it all was overwhelming. But Gardiner struggled to keep things in a practical perspective. “I can’t predict what might happen to the mosaics once Father Demetrios knows about them. Suppose he insists on destroying them? I found them, Serafina. They’re important to me.”</p>
   <p>“This is my village, <emphasis>caro.</emphasis> It is important to me.”</p>
   <p>Gardiner had no answer for that. He had no answers for any of this.</p>
   <p>They returned to town in silence. Serafina grew perceptibly less tense the farther they got from the ruined church, as though they were returning not from a searing glimpse into the pit but only from some spooky horror film, and by the time they entered the village she was her familiar lively self again, whistling, joking, walking with easy, free strides. “We will go to see Father Demetrios now, all right?” she said. “He will be at the cathedral, with Father Giuseppe, I think. They are great friends, Father Demetrios and Father Giuseppe. Father Demetrios comes here every few months to play chess with him, and to argue doctrinal matters, whether the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone or from the Father and the Son, and matters like that which will never be settled if they argue about them for ten million years.”</p>
   <p>“Does that mean Father Giuseppe will have to be told about the mosaics too?” Gardiner asked.</p>
   <p>“No. No. This matter is not the business of his church, only of the Greek Orthodox people. Let Father Demetrios handle it. If we tell Father Giuseppe, we will have the Pope here by next Tuesday, and the reporters and the television people, and everybody else. Look, here is Father Demetrios now.” She pointed across the <emphasis>piazza</emphasis> towards the pathetic little cathedral, the only badly designed one Gardiner had ever seen, a shallow-vaulted asymmetrical structure fashioned from rough-hewn blocks of dark stone ineptly fitted together. “He is very sexy, I think, Father Demetrios,” said Serafina slyly, giving Gardiner a playful nudge. “It is a great waste, a man like that in the priesthood. Come.” He was swept along in her wake, unable to protest.</p>
   <subtitle>~ * ~</subtitle>
   <p>Father Demetrios was garbed in black from head to toe, even now in the blowtorch blast of midday heat: cylindrical flat-topped black hat, long high-collared black robe sweeping down to shining black shoes. A heavy golden cross lay on his breast, its upper half vanishing into the dense coils of his long, thick, square-cut beard. He was about thirty-five, a handsome man, stocky and deep-chested, youthfully vigorous, with glossy, intelligent eyes buried in networks of little precocious wrinkles.</p>
   <p>”The building has a bad history,” he said, speaking in passable English, over a cold bottle of white wine at the <emphasis>trattoria,</emphasis> when Gardiner had finished telling his tale. “I myself have never entered it. The mosaics, be they holy or otherwise, are a surprise to me. But the tradition is that a murder was done there, a priest struck down by a furious Norman knight. It was then deconsecrated. You will take me there now?”</p>
   <p>”The road is very bad, father,” Serafina said, indicating the priest’s flowing robe, his gleaming Shoes.</p>
   <p>He grinned broadly. “No problem,” he said, and winked. Sexy, yes. Gardiner could see that. “I will be right back.” He went up to his room and returned quickly in khaki trousers, a light windbreaker over a T-shirt, and sturdy boots. All that remained of his clerical garb was the cross and the black cylindrical hat.</p>
   <p>When they reached the church, Gardiner made as though to enter first, but Father Demetrios asked for the flashlight and waved him aside. Entering the building a step behind Father Demetrios, Gardiner saw that the mosaics had reverted to their original innocuous form: shepherds and patriarchs, Abraham and Isaac, the Nativity, the journey to Bethlehem.</p>
   <p>”Quite remarkable,” said Father Demetrios. “You have photographs of the other state?”</p>
   <p>”I tried. The camera flash wouldn’t go off.”</p>
   <p>”That is to be expected. Let us go outside and wait a little while.”</p>
   <p>For ten minutes they stood in the clearing; then the priest sent Gardiner into the church alone. This time the walls were covered with a wild conglomeration of diabolic filth: a gory massacre, a bestial orgy, a witches’ Sabbath, and more. He ran to the doorway. “Father! <emphasis>Father! </emphasis>Come and see!” The priest hurried in, followed by Serafina. When Gardiner turned to illuminate the mosaics again, they were as they had been before, pure, holy.</p>
   <p>He felt his face flaming. “I swear to you, father—”</p>
   <p>“Yes. I understand. They are great masters of roguery. We will wait once again.” But, though they went in and out of the church several times over the next hour, the mosaics were unchanged. They would not revert to the hideous apocalyptic form. Gardiner found that maddening. He wanted to see the demons again, with the priest as witness. He <emphasis>needed</emphasis> to see the demons again.</p>
   <p>But the demons would not appear, and finally they gave up. On the way back to town Gardiner studied the priest carefully, wondering if the man suspected him of being some kind of lunatic. But Serafina had seen the distorted mosaics too. Thank God for that, he thought. He would be just about ready to sign up with a shrink by now, otherwise.</p>
   <p>“I must think profoundly about this,” said Father Demetrios, and went to his room. Serafina said she had to go to her grandmother: she told Gardiner she would join him for dinner. Gardiner stood by himself in the empty <emphasis>piazza,</emphasis> watching solid-looking heat-shimmers go spiraling upward. This was the hottest day yet. The town was like an oven.</p>
   <p>In late afternoon, unable to bear any of this any longer, Gardiner went back across to the church yet again, and found its walls once more bright with capering loathsomenesses. They no longer frightened him; they simply made him sad. He could weep with the sadness of it all. He had found such lovely sweet mosaics in this unexpected place, such marvels of na’ive medieval art. Why wouldn’t they stay that way? Why did they have to assail him like this, striking at the foundations of his sanity? For a long time he stood swaying in the midst of this den of horrors, looking with distaste and disbelief from scene to scene. The chapel seemed airless in the pounding heat, as though every atom of oxygen had fled from it into the sky.</p>
   <p>The figures appeared to be moving. That was a new phenomenon, and an awful one. He blinked at them. His hand quivered as he moved the flashlight beam from place to place. The leering dancers—the unthinkable shapes—</p>
   <p>Somehow the flashlight fell from his hand, and went out as it hit the ground. Gardiner knelt, groping for it in the stifling darkness. He was unable to find it, nor did he have the strength to make his way out of the church. He simply crouched where he was, kneeling, head downward, wearily resting both his palms on the sandy soil.</p>
   <p>He felt a hand on his shoulder. A calm voice: “Let us go outside, my friend.” Father Demetrios.</p>
   <p>“I fell asleep, I guess,” said Gardiner.</p>
   <p>“No,” said the priest. “Not really.”</p>
   <p>Father Demetrios had a flashlight of his own, a dim one. Gardiner pointed at the walls. They were still covered with monsters.</p>
   <p>“Do you see them?” Gardiner asked raggedly.</p>
   <p>“I see them, yes. You wanted to find mosaics here, and you found them, eh? But I think you wanted it a little too hard. This is what happens, when they know you want something too hard.”</p>
   <p>“When <emphasis>they</emphasis> know? What <emphasis>they!</emphasis> Who?”</p>
   <p>“Come,” the priest said. “Outside.”</p>
   <p>Father Demetrios led him from the building and sat him down in the clearing. Dusk had come. Serafina was not there. Gardiner noticed that the priest had placed a number of lighted candles on the ground all about the building. He was taking things from a backpack: a crucifix, a couple of small silver chalices, a Bible.</p>
   <p>“Are you going to do an exorcism?” Gardiner asked.</p>
   <p>“A reconsecration,” said Father Demetrios. “I have not the authority to do exorcisms. The effect will be the same, though. You will please say nothing of this to anyone, yes? There is some irregularity in my proceeding on my own this way.” He was going about the building now, anointing it with oil from one of the chalices. “This is all to be our little secret, do we agree?”</p>
   <p>Gardiner’s head was swimming. He heard the priest chanting in Greek and saw him raising and lowering candles and making the sign of the cross on the walls with the holy oil. It went on and on. Then he knelt a long time in prayer. “We are done,” Father Demetrios said at last. “Let us go back to the village, now.”</p>
   <p>“Shall we look inside the church, first?” Gardiner asked.</p>
   <p>“I think not. Let us simply go.”</p>
   <p>“No. I have to see,” said Gardiner. He took one of the candles out of the ground and used it to light his way.</p>
   <p>The walls were as blank as if Father Demetrios had whitewashed them. After a moment’s hesitation he put out his forefinger and rubbed. A rough stucco surface; no hint of the smoothness of mosaic tile anywhere. Even in this asphyxiating heat, Gardiner felt a chill spreading over him. This was the last straw, this newest mutation. He knew he had to flee, not just the church but the town itself. There was nothing solid here, only abysses beneath abysses.</p>
   <p>He went stumbling out. “There’s nothing there, father. An hour ago there were mosaics all over those walls!”</p>
   <p>“There were?” Father Demetrios said.</p>

   <p>Serafina met him at the hotel and said, “Will we have dinner together tonight?”</p>
   <p>“I think not,” Gardiner said. “I’m going to leave.”</p>
   <p>“Leave? Now? But it is already dark, and you have not eaten!”</p>
   <p>“That’s all right. I think I should go.”</p>
   <p>“Ah. Do you?”</p>
   <p>“This is no place for me. You’ve got too many different kinds of reality here, I think. A little retreating is in order, a little regrouping. There are other places, other mosaics, elsewhere, you know. Best to try my luck at one of those. A place without any ghosts.”</p>
   <p>She considered that for a moment. “Yes. Maybe you’re right.” She gave him a sad smile. “Do you blame me for this, what happened here?”</p>
   <p>“You? Why should I blame <emphasis>you?”</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Good,” she said. “I would like you to have at least one happy memory of my village.”</p>
   <p>He thought he saw an unstated appeal in her eyes. “Will I see you again somewhere?” he asked. “In Palermo, maybe? If I ask for you at the Hertz office?”</p>
   <p>“You could do that, yes,” she said. “Yes. Please do.”</p>
   <p>They stood a little while together, neither of them speaking. Then she leaned forward and kissed him lightly, a quick brush against his lips, and took his hand and squeezed it, and smiled, not so sadly this time; and then she was gone.</p>
   <p>Gardiner went to his room and packed, and found the <emphasis>padrone</emphasis> and settled his bill, and started off down the road, southward into the sultry night, heading for the coast, not daring to look back at dwindling Monte Saturno in his mirror, as though fearing that he would see some titanic winged figure standing with folded arms above the town, grinning at his departure. Was there any place on this island, he wondered, that had no ghosts? Maybe not. But he knew that he needed a change of air. Different ghosts. Less volatile, less mischievous. Relicts of an older, cooler realm, one where reason had held sway at least for a little while. Monte Saturno’s mysteries had been too much for him—immense, unanswerable.</p>
   <p>He reached Agrigento on the southern shore just before dawn. The ancient Agrigentum, it was, where the clear-minded, logic-loving old Greeks had built a dozen elegant temples whose austere remains still could be seen. It was cooler, here. A fresh breeze was blowing from the sea. Gardiner felt a measure of steadiness returning. Amidst the clean, stark, tranquil ruins of the calm and rational classical era he watched, with tears of happiness and relief streaming down his face, the sun come up over the shattered columns of the Temple of Olympian Zeus.</p>
