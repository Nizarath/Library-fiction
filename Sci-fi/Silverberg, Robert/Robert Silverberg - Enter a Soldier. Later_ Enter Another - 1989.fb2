   <p>IT MIGHT be heaven. Certainly it wasn't Spain and he doubted it could be Peru. He seemed to be floating, suspended midway between nothing and nothing. There was a shimmering golden sky far above him and a misty, turbulent sea of white clouds boiling far below. When he looked down he saw his legs and his feet dangling like child's toys above an unfathomable abyss, and the sight of it made him want to puke, but there was nothing in him for the puking. He was hollow. He was made of air. Even the old ache in his knee was gone, and so was the everlasting dull burning in the fleshy part of his arm where the Indian's little arrow had taken him, long ago on the shore of that island of pearls, up by Panama.</p>
   <p>It was as if he had been born again, sixty years old but freed of all the harm that his body had experienced and all its myriad accumulated injuries: freed, one might almost say, of his body itself.</p>
   <p>"Gonzalo?" he called. "Hernando?"</p>
   <p>Blurred dreamy echoes answered him. And then silence.</p>
   <p>"Mother of God, am I dead?"</p>
   <p>No. No. He had never been able to imagine death. An end to all striving? A place where nothing moved? A great emptiness, a pit without a bottom? Was this place the place of death, then? He had no way of knowing. He needed to ask the holy fathers about this.</p>
   <p>"Boy, where are my priests? Boy?"</p>
   <p>He looked about for his page. But all he saw was blinding whorls of light coiling off to infinity on all sides. The sight was beautiful but troublesome. It was hard for him to deny that he had died, seeing himself afloat like this in a realm of air and light. Died and gone to heaven. This is heaven, yes, surely, surely. What else could it be?</p>
   <p>So it was true, that if you took the Mass and took the Christ faithfully into yourself and served Him well you would be saved from your sins, you would be forgiven, you would be cleansed. He had wondered about that. But he wasn't ready yet to be dead, all the same. The thought of it was sickening and infuriating. There was so much yet to be done. And he had no memory even of being ill. He searched his body for wounds. No, no wounds. Not anywhere. Strange. Again he looked around. He was alone here. No one to be seen, not his page, nor his brother, nor De Soto, nor the priests, nor anyone. "Fray Marcos! Fray Vicente! Can't you hear me? Damn you, where are you? Mother of God! Holy Mother, blessed among women! Damn you, Fray Vicente, tell me - tell me - "</p>
   <p>His voice sounded all wrong: too thick, too deep, a stranger's voice. The words fought with his tongue and came from his lips malformed and lame, not the good crisp Spanish of Estremadura but something shameful and odd. What he heard was like the spluttering foppishness of Madrid or even the furry babble that they spoke in Barcelona; why, he might almost be a Portuguese, so coarse and clownish was his way of shaping his speech.</p>
   <p>He said carefully and slowly, "I am the Governor and Captain-General of New Castile."</p>
   <p>That came out no better, a laughable noise.</p>
   <p>"Adelantado - Alguacil Mayor - Marques de la Conquista - "</p>
   <p>The strangeness of his new way of speech made insults of his own titles. It was like being tongue-tied. He felt streams of hot sweat breaking out on his skin from the effort of trying to frame his words properly; but when he put his hand to his forehead to brush the sweat away before it could run into his eyes he seemed dry to the touch, and he was not entirely sure he could feel himself at all.</p>
   <p>He took a deep breath. "I am Francisco Pizarro!" he roared, letting the name burst desperately from him like water breaching a rotten dam.</p>
   <p>The echo came back, deep, rumbling, mocking. Frantheethco. Peetharro.</p>
   <p>That too. Even his own name, idiotically garbled.</p>
   <p>"O great God!" he cried. "Saints and angels!</p>
   <p>More garbled noises. Nothing would come out as it should. He had never known the arts of reading or writing; now it seemed that true speech itself was being taken from him. He began to wonder whether he had been right about this being heaven, supernal radiance or no. There was a curse on his tongue; a demon, perhaps, held it pinched in his claws. Was this hell, then? A very beautiful place, but hell nevertheless?</p>
   <p>He shrugged. Heaven or hell, it made no difference. He was beginning to grow more calm, beginning to accept and take stock. He knew - had learned, long ago - that there was nothing to gain from raging against that which could not be helped, even less from panic in the face of the unknown. He was here, that was all there was to it - wherever here was - and he must find a place for himself, and not this place, floating here between nothing and nothing. He had been in hells before, small hells, hells on Earth. That barren isle called Gallo, where the sun cooked you in your own skin and there was nothing to eat but crabs that had the taste of dog-dung. And that dismal swamp at the mouth of the Rio Biru, where the rain fell in rivers and the trees reached down to cut you like swords. And the mountains he had crossed with his army, where the snow was so cold that it burned, and the air went into your throat like a dagger at every breath. He had come forth from those, and they had been worse than this. Here there was no pain and no danger; here there was only soothing light and a strange absence of all discomfort. He began to move forward. He was walking on air. Look, look, he thought, I am walking on air! Then he said it out loud. "I am walking on air," he announced, and laughed at the way the words emerged from him. "Santiago! Walking on air! But why not? I am Pizarro!" He shouted it with all his might, "Pizarro! Pizarro!" and waited for it to come back to him.</p>
   <p>Peetharro. Peetharro.</p>
   <p>He laughed. He kept on walking.</p>

   <p>Tanner sat hunched forward in the vast sparkling sphere that was the ninth-floor imaging lab, watching the little figure at the distant center of the holotank strut and preen. Lew Richardson, crouching beside him with both hands thrust into the data gloves so that he could feed instructions to the permutation network, seemed almost not to be breathing - seemed to be just one more part of the network, in fact.</p>
   <p>But that was Richardson's way, Tanner thought: total absorption in the task at hand. Tanner envied him that. They were very different sorts of men. Richardson lived for his programming and nothing but his programming. It was his grand passion. Tanner had never quite been able to understand people who were driven by grand passions. Richardson was like some throwback to an earlier age, an age when things had really mattered, an age when you were able to have some faith in the significance of your own endeavors.</p>
   <p>"How do you like the armor?" Richardson asked. "The armor's very fine, I think. We got it from old engravings. It has real flair."</p>
   <p>"Just the thing for tropical climates," said Tanner. "A nice tin suit with matching helmet."</p>
   <p>He coughed and shifted about irritably in his seat. The demonstration had been going on for half an hour without anything that seemed to be of any importance happening - just the minuscule image of the bearded man in Spanish armor tramping back and forth across the glowing field - and he was beginning to get impatient.</p>
   <p>Richardson didn't seem to notice the harshness in Tanner's voice or the restlessness of his movements. He went on making small adjustments. He was a small man himself, neat and precise in dress and appearance, with faded blond hair and pale blue eyes and a thin, straight mouth. Tanner felt huge and shambling beside him. In theory Tanner had authority over Richardson's research projects, but in fact he always had simply permitted Richardson to do as he pleased. This time, though, it might be necessary finally to rein him in a little.</p>
   <p>This was the twelfth or thirteenth demonstration that Richardson had subjected him to since he had begun fooling around with this historical-simulation business. The others all had been disasters of one kind or another, and Tanner expected that this one would finish the same way. And basically Tanner was growing uneasy about the project that he once had given his stamp of approval to, so long ago. It was getting harder and harder to go on believing that all this work served any useful purpose. Why had it been allowed to absorb so much of Richardson's group's time and so much of the lab's research budget for so many months? What possible value was it going to have for anybody? What possible use?</p>
   <p>It's just a game, Tanner thought. One more desperate meaningless technological stunt, one more pointless pirouette in a meaningless ballet. The expenditure of vast resources on a display of ingenuity for ingenuity's sake and nothing else: now there's decadence for you.</p>
   <p>The tiny image in the holotank suddenly began to lose color and definition.</p>
   <p>"Uh-oh," Tanner said. "There it goes. Like all the others."</p>
   <p>But Richardson shook his head. "This time it's different, Harry."</p>
   <p>"You think?"</p>
   <p>"We aren't losing him. He's simply moving around in there of his own volition, getting beyond our tracking parameters. Which means that we've achieved the high level of autonomy that we were shooting for."</p>
   <p>"Volition, Lew? Autonomy?"</p>
   <p>"You know that those are our goals."</p>
   <p>"Yes, I know what our goals are supposed to be," said Tanner, with some annoyance. "I'm simply not convinced that a loss of focus is a proof that you've got volition."</p>
   <p>"Here," Richardson said. "I'll cut in the stochastic tracking program. He moves freely, we freely follow him." Into the computer ear in his lapel he said, "Give me a gain boost, will you?" He made a quick flicking gesture with his left middle finger to indicate the quantitative level.</p>
   <p>The little figure in ornate armor and pointed boots grew sharp again. Tanner could see fine details on the armor, the plumed helmet, the tapering shoulder-pieces, the joints at the elbows, the intricate pommel of his sword. He was marching from left to right in a steady hip-rolling way, like a man who was climbing the tallest mountain in the world and didn't mean to break his stride until he was across the summit. The fact that he was walking in what appeared to be mid-air seemed not to trouble him at all.</p>
   <p>"There he is," Richardson said grandly. "We've got him back, all right? The conqueror of Peru, before your very eyes, in the flesh. So to speak."</p>
   <p>Tanner nodded. Pizarro, yes, before his very eyes. And he had to admit that what he saw was impressive and even, somehow, moving. Something about the dogged way with which that small armored figure was moving across the gleaming pearly field of the holotank aroused a kind of sympathy in him. That little man was entirely imaginary, but he didn't seem to know that, or if he did he wasn't letting it stop him for a moment: he went plugging on, and on and on, as if he intended actually to get somewhere. Watching that, Tanner was oddly captivated by it, and found himself surprised suddenly to discover that his interest in the entire project was beginning to rekindle.</p>
   <p>"Can you make him any bigger?" he asked. "I want to see his face."</p>
   <p>"I can make him big as life," Richardson said. "Bigger. Any size you like. Here."</p>
   <p>He flicked a finger and the hologram of Pizarro expanded instantaneously to a height of about two meters. The Spaniard halted in mid-stride as though he might actually be aware of the imaging change.</p>
   <p>That can't be possible, Tanner thought. That isn't a living consciousness out there. Or is it?</p>
   <p>Pizarro stood poised easily in mid-air, glowering, shading his eyes as if staring into a dazzling glow. There were brilliant streaks of color in the air all around him, like an aurora. He was a tall, lean man in late middle age with a grizzled beard and a hard, angular face. His lips were thin, his nose was sharp, his eyes were cold, shrewd, keen. It seemed to Tanner that those eyes had come to rest on him, and he felt a chill.</p>
   <p>My God, Tanner thought, he's real.</p>

   <p>It had been a French program to begin with, something developed at the Centre Mondiale de la Computation in Lyons about the year 2119. The French had some truly splendid minds working in software in those days. They worked up astounding programs, and then nobody did anything with them. That was their version of Century Twenty-Two Malaise.</p>
   <p>The French programmers' idea was to use holograms of actual historical personages to dress up the son et lumiere tourist events at the great monuments of their national history. Not just preprogrammed robot mockups of the old Disneyland kind, which would stand around in front of Notre Dame or the Arc de Triomphe or the Eiffel Tower and deliver canned spiels, but apparent reincarnations of the genuine great ones, who could freely walk and talk and answer questions and make little quips. Imagine Louis XIV demonstrating the fountains of Versailles, they said, or Picasso leading a tour of Paris museums, or Sartre sitting in his Left Bank cafe exchanging existential bons mots with passersby! Napoleon! Joan of Arc! Alexandre Dumas! Perhaps the simulations could do even more than that: perhaps they could be designed so well that they would be able to extend and embellish the achievements of their original lifetimes with new accomplishments, a fresh spate of paintings and novels and works of philosophy and great architectural visions by vanished masters.</p>
   <p>The concept was simple enough in essence. Write an intelligencing program that could absorb data, digest it, correlate it, and generate further programs based on what you had given it. No real difficulty there. Then start feeding your program with the collected written works - if any - of the person to be simulated: that would provide not only a general sense of his ideas and positions but also of his underlying pattern of approach to situations, his style of thinking - for le style, after all, est l'homme meme. If no collected works happened to be available, why, find works about the subject by his contemporaries, and use those. Next, toss in the totality of the historical record of the subject's deeds, including all significant subsequent scholarly analyses, making appropriate allowances for conflicts in interpretation - indeed, taking advantages of such conflicts to generate a richer portrait, full of the ambiguities and contradictions that are the inescapable hallmarks of any human being. Now build in substrata of general cultural data of the proper period so that the subject has a loam of references and vocabulary out of which to create thoughts that are appropriate to his place in time and space. Stir. Et voila! Apply a little sophisticated imaging technology and you had a simulation capable of thinking and conversing and behaving as though it is the actual self after which it was patterned.</p>
   <p>Of course, this would require a significant chunk of computer power. But that was no problem, in a world where l50-gigaflops networks were standard laboratory items and ten-year-olds carried pencil-sized computers with capacities far beyond the ponderous mainframes of their great-great-grandparents' day. No, there was no theoretical reason why the French project could not have succeeded. Once the Lyons programmers had worked out the basic intelligencing scheme that was needed to write the rest of the programs, it all should have followed smoothly enough.</p>
   <p>Two things went wrong: one rooted in an excess of ambition that may have been a product of the peculiarly French personalities of the original programmers, and the other having to do with an abhorrence of failure typical of the major nations of the mid-twenty-second century, of which France was one.</p>
   <p>The first was a fatal change of direction that the project underwent in its early phases. The King of Spain was coming to Paris on a visit of state; and the programmers decided that in his honor they would synthesize Don Quixote for him as their initial project. Though the intelligencing program had been designed to simulate only individuals who had actually existed, there seemed no inherent reason why a fictional character as well documented as Don Quixote could not be produced instead. There was Cervantes' lengthy novel; there was ample background data available on the milieu in which Don Quixote supposedly had lived; there was a vast library of critical analysis of the book and of the Don's distinctive and flamboyant personality. Why should bringing Don Quixote to life out of a computer be any different from simulating Louis XIV, say, or Moliere, or Cardinal Richelieu? True, they had all existed once, and the knight of La Mancha was a mere figment; but had Cervantes not provided far more detail about Don Quixote's mind and soul than was known of Richelieu, or Moliere, or Louis XIV?</p>
   <p>Indeed he had. The Don - like Oedipus, like Odysseus, like Othello, like David Copperfield - had come to have a reality far more profound and tangible than that of most people who had indeed actually lived. Such characters as those had transcended their fictional origins. But not so far as the computer was concerned. It was able to produce a convincing fabrication of Don Quixote, all right - a gaunt bizarre holographic figure that had all the right mannerisms, that ranted and raved in the expectable way, that referred knowledgeably to Dulcinea and Rosinante and Mambrino's helmet. The Spanish king was amused and impressed. But to the French the experiment was a failure. They had produced a Don Quixote who was hopelessly locked to the Spain of the late sixteenth century and to the book from which he had sprung. He had no capacity for independent life and thought - no way to perceive the world that had brought him into being, or to comment on it, or to interact with it. There was nothing new or interesting about that. Any actor could dress up in armor and put on a scraggly beard and recite snatches of Cervantes. What had come forth from the computer, after three years of work, was no more than a predictable reprocessing of what had gone into it, sterile, stale.</p>
   <p>Which led the Centre Mondial de la Computation to its next fatal step: abandoning the whole thing. Zut! and the project was cancelled without any further attempts. No simulated Picassos, no simulated Napoleons, no Joans of Arc. The Quixote event had soured everyone and no one had the heart to proceed with the work from there. Suddenly it had the taint of failure about it, and France - like Germany, like Australia, like the Han Commercial Sphere, like Brazil, like any of the dynamic centers of the modern world, had a horror of failure. Failure was something to be left to the backward nations or the decadent ones - to the Islamic Socialist Union, say, or the Soviet People's Republic, or to that slumbering giant, the United States of America. So the historic-personage simulation scheme was put aside.</p>
   <p>The French thought so little of it, as a matter of fact, that after letting it lie fallow for a few years they licensed it to a bunch of Americans, who had heard about it somehow and felt it might be amusing to play with.</p>

   <p>"You may really have done it this time," Tanner said.</p>
   <p>"Yes. I think we have. After all those false starts."</p>
   <p>Tanner nodded. How often had he come into this room with hopes high, only to see some botch, some inanity, some depressing bungle? Richardson had always had an explanation. Sherlock Holmes hadn't worked because he was fictional: that was a necessary recheck of the French Quixote project, demonstrating that fictional characters didn't have the right sort of reality texture to take proper advantage of the program, not enough ambiguity, not enough contradiction. King Arthur had failed for the same reason. Julius Caesar? Too far in the past, maybe: unreliable data, bordering on fiction. Moses? Ditto. Einstein? Too complex, perhaps, for the project in its present level of development: they needed more experience first. Queen Elizabeth I? George Washington? Mozart? We're learning more each time, Richardson insisted after each failure. This isn't black magic we're doing, you know. We aren't necromancers, we're programmers, and we have to figure out how to give the program what it needs.</p>
   <p>And now Pizarro?</p>
   <p>"Why do you want to work with him?" Tanner had asked, five or six months earlier. "A ruthless medieval Spanish imperialist, is what I remember from school. A bloodthirsty despoiler of a great culture. A man without morals, honor, faith - "</p>
   <p>"You may be doing him an injustice," said Richardson. "He's had a bad press for centuries. And there are things about him that fascinate me."</p>
   <p>"Such as?"</p>
   <p>"His drive. His courage. His absolute confidence. The other side of ruthlessness, the good side of it, is a total concentration on your task, an utter unwillingess to be stopped by any obstacle. Whether or not you approve of the things he accomplished, you have to admire a man who - "</p>
   <p>"All right," Tanner said, abruptly growing weary of the whole enterprise. "Do Pizarro. Whatever you want."</p>
   <p>The months had passed. Richardson gave him vague progress reports, nothing to arouse much hope. But now Tanner stared at the tiny strutting figure in the holotank and the conviction began to grow in him that Richardson finally had figured out how to use the simulation program as it was meant to be used.</p>
   <p>"So you've actually recreated him, you think? Someone who lived - what, five hundred years ago?"</p>
   <p>"He died in l54l," said Richardson.</p>
   <p>"Almost six hundred, then."</p>
   <p>"And he's not like the others - not simply a recreation of a great figure out of the past who can run through a set of pre-programmed speeches. What we've got here, if I'm right, is an artificially generated intelligence which can think for itself in modes other than the ones its programmers think in. Which has more information available to itself, in other words, than we've provided it with. That would be the real accomplishment. That's the fundamental philosophical leap that we were going for when we first got involved with this project. To use the program to give us new programs that are capable of true autonomous thought - a program that can think like Pizarro, instead of like Lew Richardson's idea of some historian's idea of how Pizarro might have thought."</p>
   <p>"Yes," Tanner said.</p>
   <p>"Which means we won't just get back the expectable, the predictable. There'll be surprises. There's no way to learn anything, you know, except through surprises. The sudden combination of known components into something brand new. And that's what I think we've managed to bring off here, at long last. Harry, it may be the biggest artificial-intelligence breakthrough ever achieved."</p>
   <p>Tanner pondered that. Was it so? Had they truly done it?</p>
   <p>And if they had -</p>
   <p>Something new and troubling was beginning to occur to him, much later in the game than it should have. Tanner stared at the holographic figure floating in the center of the tank, that fierce old man with the harsh face and the cold, cruel eyes. He thought about what sort of man he must have been - the man after whom this image had been modeled. A man who was willing to land in South America at age fifty or sixty or whatever he had been, an ignorant illiterate Spanish peasant wearing a suit of ill-fitting armor and waving a rusty sword, and set out to conquer a great empire of millions of people spreading over thousands of miles. Tanner wondered what sort of man would be capable of carrying out a thing like that. Now that man's eyes were staring into his own and it was a struggle to meet so implacable a gaze.</p>
   <p>After a moment he looked away. His left leg began to quiver. He glanced uneasily at Richardson.</p>
   <p>"Look at those eyes, Lew. Christ, they're scary!"</p>
   <p>"I know. I designed them myself, from the old prints."</p>
   <p>"Do you think he's seeing us right now? Can he do that?"</p>
   <p>"All he is is software, Harry."</p>
   <p>"He seemed to know it when you expanded the image."</p>
   <p>Richardson shrugged. "He's very good software. I tell you, he's got autonomy, he's got volition. He's got an electronic mind, is what I'm saying. He may have perceived a transient voltage kick. But there are limits to his perceptions, all the same. I don't think there's any way that he can see anything that's outside the holotank unless it's fed to him in the form of data he can process, which hasn't been done."</p>
   <p>"You don't think? You aren't sure?"</p>
   <p>"Harry. Please."</p>
   <p>"This man conquered the entire enormous Incan empire with fifty soldiers, didn't he?"</p>
   <p>"In fact I believe it was more like a hundred and fifty."</p>
   <p>"Fifty, a hundred fifty, what's the difference? Who knows what you've actually got here? What if you did an even better job than you suspect?"</p>
   <p>"What are you saying?"</p>
   <p>"What I'm saying is, I'm uneasy all of a sudden. For a long time I didn't think this project was going to produce anything at all. Suddenly I'm starting to think that maybe it's going to produce more than we can handle. I don't want any of your goddamned simulations walking out of the tank and conquering us."</p>
   <p>Richardson turned to him. His face was flushed, but he was grinning. "Harry, Harry! For God's sake! Five minutes ago you didn't think we had anything at all here except a tiny picture that wasn't even in focus. Now you've gone so far the other way that you're imagining the worst kind of - "</p>
   <p>"I see his eyes, Lew. I'm worried that his eyes see me."</p>
   <p>"Those aren't real eyes you're looking at. What you see is nothing but a graphics program projected into a holotank. There's no visual capacity there as you understand the concept. His eyes will see you only if I want them to. Right now they don't."</p>
   <p>"But you can make them see me?"</p>
   <p>"I can make them see anything I want them to see. I created him, Harry."</p>
   <p>"With volition. With autonomy."</p>
   <p>"After all this time you start worrying now about these things?"</p>
   <p>"It's my neck on the line if something that you guys on the technical side make runs amok. This autonomy thing suddenly troubles me."</p>
   <p>"I'm still the one with the data gloves," Richardson said. "I twitch my fingers and he dances. That's not really Pizarro down there, remember. And that's no Frankenstein monster either. It's just a simulation. It's just so much data, just a bunch of electromagnetic impulses that I can shut off with one movement of my pinkie."</p>
   <p>"Do it, then."</p>
   <p>"Shut him off? But I haven't begun to show you - "</p>
   <p>"Shut him off, and then turn him on," Tanner said.</p>
   <p>Richardson looked bothered. "If you say so, Harry."</p>
   <p>He moved a finger. The image of Pizarro vanished from the holotank. Swirling gray mists moved in it for a moment, and then all was white wool. Tanner felt a quick jolt of guilt, as though he had just ordered the execution of the man in the medieval armor. Richardson gestured again, and color flashed across the tank, and then Pizarro reappeared.</p>
   <p>"I just wanted to see how much autonomy your little guy really has," said Tanner. "Whether he was quick enough to head you off and escape into some other channel before you could cut his power."</p>
   <p>"You really don't understand how this works at all, do you, Harry?"</p>
   <p>"I just wanted to see," said Tanner again, sullenly. After a moment's silence he said, "Do you ever feel like God?"</p>
   <p>"Like God?"</p>
   <p>"You breathed life in. Life of a sort, anyway. But you breathed free will in, too. That's what this experiment is all about, isn't it? All your talk about volition and autonomy? You're trying to recreate a human mind - which means to create it all over again - a mind that can think in its own special way, and come up with its own unique responses to situations, which will not necessarily be the responses that its programmers might anticipate, in fact almost certainly will not be, and which not might be all that desirable or beneficial, either, and you simply have to allow for that risk, just as God, once he gave free will to mankind, knew that He was likely to see all manner of evil deeds being performed by His creations as they exercised that free will - "</p>
   <p>"Please, Harry - "</p>
   <p>"Listen, is it possible for me to talk with your Pizarro?"</p>
   <p>"Why?"</p>
   <p>"By way of finding out what you've got there. To get some first-hand knowledge of what the project has accomplished. Or you could say I just want to test the quality of the simulation. Whatever. I'd feel more a part of this thing, more aware of what it' s all about in here, if I could have some direct contact with him. Would it be all right if I did that?"</p>
   <p>"Yes. Of course."</p>
   <p>"Do I have to talk to him in Spanish?"</p>
   <p>"In any language you like. There's an interface, after all. He'll think it's his own language coming in, no matter what, sixteenth-century Spanish. And he'll answer you in what seems like Spanish to him, but you'll hear it in English."</p>
   <p>"Are you sure?"</p>
   <p>"Of course."</p>
   <p>"And you don't mind if I make contact with him?"</p>
   <p>"Whatever you like."</p>
   <p>"It won't upset his calibration, or anything?"</p>
   <p>"It won't do any harm at all, Harry."</p>
   <p>"Fine. Let me talk to him, then."</p>

   <p>There was a disturbance in the air ahead, a shifting, a swirling, like a little whirlwind. Pizarro halted and watched it for a moment, wondering what was coming next. A demon arriving to torment him, maybe. Or an angel. Whatever it was, he was ready for it.</p>
   <p>Then a voice out of the whirlwind said, in that same comically exaggerated Castilian Spanish that Pizarro himself had found himself speaking a little while before, "Can you hear me?"</p>
   <p>"I hear you, yes. I don't see you. Where are you?"</p>
   <p>"Right in front of you. Wait a second. I'll show you." Out of the whirlwind came a strange face that hovered in the middle of nowhere, a face without a body, a lean face, close-shaven, no beard at all, no mustache, the hair cut very short, dark eyes set close together. He had never seen a face like that before.</p>
   <p>"What are you?" Pizarro asked. "A demon or an angel?"</p>
   <p>"Neither one." Indeed he didn't sound very demonic. "A man, just like you."</p>
   <p>"Not much like me, I think. Is a face all there is to you, or do you have a body too?"</p>
   <p>"All you see of me is a face?"</p>
   <p>"Yes."</p>
   <p>"Wait a second."</p>
   <p>"I will wait as long as I have to. I have plenty of time."</p>
   <p>The face disappeared. Then it returned, attached to the body of a big, wide-shouldered man who was wearing a long loose gray robe, something like a priest's cassock, but much more ornate, with points of glowing light gleaming on it everywhere. Then the body vanished and Pizarro could see only the face again. He could make no sense out of any of this. He began to understand how the Indians must have felt when the first Spaniards came over the horizon, riding horses, carrying guns, wearing armor.</p>
   <p>"You are very strange. Are you an Englishman, maybe?"</p>
   <p>"American."</p>
   <p>"Ah," Pizarro said, as though that made things better. "An American. And what is that?"</p>
   <p>The face wavered and blurred for a moment. There was mysterious new agitation in the thick white clouds surrounding it. Then the face grew steady and said, "America is a country north of Peru. A very large country, where many people live."</p>
   <p>"You mean New Spain, which was Mexico, where my kinsman Cortes is Captain-General?"</p>
   <p>"North of Mexico. Far to the north of it."</p>
   <p>Pizarro shrugged. "I know nothing of those places. Or not very much. There is an island called Florida, yes? And stories of cities of gold, but I think they are only stories. I found the gold, in Peru. Enough to choke on, I found. Tell me this, am I in heaven now?"</p>
   <p>"No."</p>
   <p>"Then this is hell?"</p>
   <p>"Not that, either. Where you are - it's very difficult to explain, actually - "</p>
   <p>"I am in America."</p>
   <p>"Yes. In America, yes."</p>
   <p>"And am I dead?"</p>
   <p>There was silence for a moment.</p>
   <p>"No, not dead," the voice said uneasily.</p>
   <p>"You are lying to me, I think."</p>
   <p>"How could we be speaking with each other, if you were dead?"</p>
   <p>Pizarro laughed hoarsely. "Are you asking me? I understand nothing of what is happening to me in this place. Where are my priests? Where is my page? Send me my brother!" He glared. "Well? Why don't you get them for me?"</p>
   <p>"They aren't here. You're here all by yourself, Don Francisco."</p>
   <p>"In America. All by myself in your America. Show me your America, then. Is there such a place? Is America all clouds and whorls of light? Where is America? Let me see America. Prove to me that I am in America."</p>
   <p>There was another silence, longer than the last. Then the face disappeared and the wall of white cloud began to boil and churn more fiercely than before. Pizarro stared into the midst of it, feeling a mingled sense of curiosity and annoyance. The face did not reappear. He saw nothing at all. He was being toyed with. He was a prisoner in some strange place and they were treating him like a child, like a dog, like - like an Indian. Perhaps this was the retribution for what he had done to King Atahuallpa, then, that fine noble foolish man who had given himself up to him in all innocence, and whom he had put to death so that he might have the gold of Atahuallpa's kingdom.</p>
   <p>Well, so be it, Pizarro thought. Atahuallpa accepted all that befell him without complaint and without fear, and so will I. Christ will be my guardian, and if there is no Christ, well, then I will have no guardian, and so be it. So be it.</p>
   <p>The voice out of the whirlwind said suddenly, "Look, Don Francisco. This is America."</p>
   <p>A picture appeared on the wall of cloud. It was a kind of picture Pizarro had never before encountered or even imagined, one that seemed to open before him like a gate and sweep him in and carry him along through a vista of changing scenes depicted in brilliant, vivid bursts of color. It was like flying high above the land, looking down on an infinite scroll of miracles. He saw vast cities without walls, roadways that unrolled like endless skeins of white ribbon, huge lakes, mighty rivers, gigantic mountains, everything speeding past him so swiftly that he could scarcely absorb any of it. In moments it all became chaotic in his mind: the buildings taller than the highest cathedral spire, the swarming masses of people, the shining metal chariots without beasts to draw them, the stupendous landscapes, the close-packed complexity of it all. Watching all this, he felt the fine old hunger taking possession of him again: he wanted to grasp this strange vast place, and seize it, and clutch it close, and ransack it for all it was worth. But the thought of that was overwhelming. His eyes grew glassy and his heart began to pound so terrifyingly that he supposed he would be able to feel it thumping if he put his hand to the front of his armor. He turned away, muttering, "Enough. Enough."</p>
   <p>The terrifying picture vanished. Gradually the clamor of his heart subsided.</p>
   <p>Then he began to laugh.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>"Peru!" he cried. "Peru was nothing, next to your America! Peru was a hole! Peru was mud! How ignorant I was! I went to Peru, when there was America, ten thousand times as grand! I wonder what I could find, in America." He smacked his lips and winked. Then, chuckling, he said, "But don't be afraid. I won't try to conquer your America. I'm too old for that now. And perhaps America would have been too much for me, even before. Perhaps." He grinned savagely at the troubled staring face of the short-haired beardless man, the American. "I really am dead, is this not so? I feel no hunger, I feel no pain, no thirst, when I put my hand to my body I do not feel even my body. I am like one who lies dreaming. But this is no dream. Am I a ghost?"</p>
   <p>"Not - exactly."</p>
   <p>"Not exactly a ghost! Not exactly! No one with half the brains of a pig would talk like that. What is that supposed to mean?"</p>
   <p>"It's not easy explaining it in words you would understand, Don Francisco."</p>
   <p>"No, of course not. I am very stupid, as everyone knows, and that is why I conquered Peru, because I was so very stupid. But let it pass. I am not exactly a ghost, but I am dead all the same, right?"</p>
   <p>"Well - "</p>
   <p>"I am dead, yes. But somehow I have not gone to hell or even to purgatory but I am still in the world, only it is much later now. I have slept as the dead sleep, and now I have awakened in some year that is far beyond my time, and it is the time of America. Is this not so? Who is king now? Who is pope? What year is this? l750? l800?"</p>
   <p>"The year 2l30," the face said, after some hesitation.</p>
   <p>"Ah." Pizarro tugged thoughtfully at his lower lip. "And the king? Who is king?"</p>
   <p>A long pause. "Alfonso is his name," said the face.</p>
   <p>"Alfonso? The kings of Aragon were called Alfonso. The father of Ferdinand, he was Alfonso. Alfonso V, he was."</p>
   <p>"Alfonso XIX is King of Spain now."</p>
   <p>"Ah. Ah. And the pope? Who is pope?"</p>
   <p>A pause again. Not to know the name of the pope, immediately upon being asked? How strange. Demon or no, this was a fool.</p>
   <p>"Pius," said the voice, when some time had passed. "Pius XVI."</p>
   <p>"The sixteenth Pius," said Pizarro somberly. "Jesus and Mary, the sixteenth Pius! What has become of me? Long dead, is what I am. Still unwashed of all my sins. I can feel them clinging to my skin like mud, still. And you are a sorcerer, you American, and you have brought me to life again. Eh? Eh? Is that not so?"</p>
   <p>"It is something like that, Don Francisco," the face admitted.</p>
   <p>"So you speak your Spanish strangely because you no longer understand the right way of speaking it. Eh? Even I speak Spanish in a strange way, and I speak it in a voice that does not sound like my own. No one speaks Spanish any more, eh? Eh? Only American, they speak. Eh? But you try to speak Spanish, only it comes out stupidly. And you have caused me to speak the same way, thinking it is the way I spoke, though you are wrong. Well, you can do miracles, but I suppose you can't do everything perfectly, even in this land of miracles of the year 2l30. Eh? Eh?" Pizarro leaned forward intently. "What do you say? You thought I was a fool, because I don't have reading and writing? I am not so ignorant, eh? I understand things quickly."</p>
   <p>"You understand very quickly indeed."</p>
   <p>"But you have knowledge of many things that are unknown to me. You must know the manner of my death, for example. How strange that is, talking to you of the manner of my death, but you must know it, eh? When did it come to me? And how? Did it come in my sleep? No, no, how could that be? They die in their sleep in Spain, but not in Peru. How was it, then? I was set upon by cowards, was I? Some brother of Atahuallpa, falling upon me as I stepped out of my house? A slave sent by the Inca Manco, or one of those others? No. No. The Indians would not harm me, for all that I did to them. It was the young Almagro who took me down, was it not, in vengeance for his father, or Juan de Herrada, eh? or perhaps even Picado, my own secretary - no, not Picado, he was my man, always - but maybe Alvarado, the young one, Diego - well, one of those, and it would have been sudden, very sudden or I would have been able to stop them - am I right, am I speaking the truth? Tell me. You know these things. Tell me of the manner of my dying." There was no answer. Pizarro shaded his eyes and peered into the dazzling pearly whiteness. He was no longer able to see the face of the American. "Are you there?" Pizarro said. "Where have you gone? Were you only a dream? American! American! Where have you gone?"</p>

   <p>The break in contact was jolting. Tanner sat rigid, hands trembling, lips tightly clamped. Pizarro, in the holotank, was no more than a distant little streak of color now, no larger than his thumb, gesticulating amid the swirling clouds. The vitality of him, the arrogance, the fierce probing curiosity, the powerful hatreds and jealousies, the strength that had come from vast ventures recklessly conceived and desperately seen through to triumph, all the things that were Francisco Pizarro, all that Tanner had felt an instant before - all that had vanished at the flick of a finger.</p>
   <p>After a moment or two Tanner felt the shock beginning to ease. He turned toward Richardson.</p>
   <p>"What happened?"</p>
   <p>"I had to pull you out of there. I didn't want you telling him anything about how he died."</p>
   <p>"I don't know how he died."</p>
   <p>"Well, neither does he, and I didn't want to chance it that you did. There's no predicting what sort of psychological impact that kind of knowledge might have on him."</p>
   <p>"You talk about him as though he's alive."</p>
   <p>"Isn't he?" Richardson said.</p>
   <p>"If I said a thing like that, you'd tell me that I was being ignorant and unscientific."</p>
   <p>Richardson smiled faintly. "You're right. But somehow I trust myself to know what I'm saying when I say that he's alive. I know I don't mean it literally and I'm not sure about you. What did you think of him, anyway?"</p>
   <p>"He's amazing," Tanner said. "Really amazing. The strength of him - I could feel it pouring out at me in waves. And his mind! So quick, the way he picked up on everything. Guessing that he must be in the future. Wanting to know what number pope was in office. Wanting to see what America looked like. And the cockiness of him! Telling me that he's not up to the conquest of America, that he might have tried for it instead of Peru a few years earlier, but not now, now he's a little too old for that. Incredible! Nothing could faze him for long, even when he realized that he must have been dead for a long time. Wanting to know how he died, even!" Tanner frowned. "What age did you make him, anyway, when you put this program together?"</p>
   <p>"About sixty. Five or six years after the conquest, and a year or two before he died. At the height of his power, that is."</p>
   <p>"I suppose you couldn't have let him have any knowledge of his actual death. That way he'd be too much like some kind of a ghost."</p>
   <p>"That's what we thought. We set the cutoff at a time when he had done everything that he had set out to do, when he was the complete Pizarro. But before the end. He didn't need to know about that. Nobody does. That's why I had to yank you, you see? In case you knew. And started to tell him."</p>
   <p>Tanner shook his head. "If I ever knew, I've forgotten it. How did it happen?"</p>
   <p>"Exactly as he guessed: at the hands of his own comrades."</p>
   <p>"So he saw it coming."</p>
   <p>"At the age we made him, he already knew that a civil war had started in South America, that the conquistadores were quarreling over the division of the spoils. We built that much into him. He knows that his partner Almagro has turned against him and been beaten in battle, and that they've executed him. What he doesn't know, but obviously can expect, is that Almagro's friends are going to break into his house and try to kill him. He's got it all figured out pretty much as it's going to happen. As it did happen, I should say."</p>
   <p>"Incredible. To be that shrewd."</p>
   <p>"He was a son of a bitch, yes. But he was a genius too."</p>
   <p>"Was he, really? Or is it that you made him one when you set up the program for him?"</p>
   <p>"All we put in were the objective details of his life, patterns of event and response. Plus an overlay of commentary by others, his contemporaries and later historians familiar with the record, providing an extra dimension of character density. Put in enough of that kind of stuff and apparently they add up to the whole personality. It isn't my personality or that of anybody else who worked on this project, Harry. When you put in Pizarro's set of events and responses you wind up getting Pizarro. You get the ruthlessness and you get the brilliance. Put in a different set, you get someone else. And what we've finally seen, this time, is that when we do our work right we get something out of the computer that's bigger than the sum of what we put in."</p>
   <p>"Are you sure?"</p>
   <p>Richardson said, "Did you notice that he complained about the Spanish that he thought you were speaking?"</p>
   <p>"Yes. He said that it sounded strange, that nobody seemed to know how to speak proper Spanish any more. I didn't quite follow that. Does the interface you built speak lousy Spanish?"</p>
   <p>"Evidently it speaks lousy sixteenth-century Spanish," Richardson said. "Nobody knows what sixteenth-century Spanish actually sounded like. We can only guess. Apparently we didn't guess very well."</p>
   <p>"But how would he know? You synthesized him in the first place! If you don't know how Spanish sounded in his time, how would he? All he should know about Spanish, or about anything, is what you put into him."</p>
   <p>"Exactly," Richardson said.</p>
   <p>"But that doesn't make any sense, Lew!"</p>
   <p>"He also said that the Spanish he heard himself speaking was no good, and that his own voice didn't sound right to him either. That we had caused him to speak this way, thinking that was how he actually spoke, but we were wrong."</p>
   <p>"How could he possibly know what his voice really sounded like, if all he is is a simulation put together by people who don't have the slightest notion of what his voice really - "</p>
   <p>"I don't have any idea," said Richardson quietly. "But he does know."</p>
   <p>"Does he? Or is this just some diabolical Pizarro-like game that he's playing to unsettle us, because that's in his character as you devised it?"</p>
   <p>"I think he does know," Richardson said.</p>
   <p>"Where's he finding it out, then?"</p>
   <p>"It's there. We don't know where, but he does. It's somewhere in the data that we put through the permutation network, even if we don't know it and even though we couldn't find it now if we set out to look for it. He can find it. He can't manufacture that kind of knowledge by magic, but he can assemble what look to us like seemingly irrelevant bits and come up with new information leading to a conclusion which is meaningful to him. That's what we mean by artificial intelligence, Harry. We've finally got a program that works something like the human brain: by leaps of intuition so sudden and broad that they seem inexplicable and non-quantifiable, even if they really aren't. We've fed in enough stuff so that he can assimilate a whole stew of ostensibly unrelated data and come up with new information. We don't just have a ventriloquist's dummy in that tank. We've got something that thinks it's Pizarro and thinks like Pizarro and knows things that Pizarro knew and we don't. Which means we've accomplished the qualitative jump in artificial intelligence capacity that we set out to achieve with this project. It's awesome. I get shivers down my back when I think about it."</p>
   <p>"I do too," Tanner said. "But not so much from awe as fear."</p>
   <p>"Fear?"</p>
   <p>"Knowing now that he has capabilities beyond those he was programmed for, how can you be so absolutely certain that he can't commandeer your network somehow and get himself loose?"</p>
   <p>"It's technically impossible. All he is is electromagnetic impulses. I can pull the plug on him any time I like. There's nothing to panic over here. Believe me, Harry."</p>
   <p>"I'm trying to."</p>
   <p>"I can show you the schematics. We've got a phenomenal simulation in that computer, yes. But it's still only a simulation. It isn't a vampire, it isn't a werewolf, it isn't anything supernatural. It's just the best damned computer simulation anyone's ever made."</p>
   <p>"It makes me uneasy. He makes me uneasy."</p>
   <p>"He should. The power of the man, the indomitable nature of him - why do you think I summoned him up, Harry? He's got something that we don't understand in this country any more. I want us to study him. I want us to try to learn what that kind of drive and determination is really like. Now that you've talked to him, now that you've touched his spirit, of course you're shaken up by him. He radiates tremendous confidence. He radiates fantastic faith in himself. That kind of man can achieve anything he wants - even conquer the whole Inca empire with a hundred fifty men, or however many it was. But I'm not frightened of what we've put together here. And you shouldn't be either. We should all be damned proud of it. You as well as the people on the technical side. And you will be, too."</p>
   <p>"I hope you're right," Tanner said.</p>
   <p>"You'll see."</p>
   <p>For a long moment Tanner stared in silence at the holotank, where the image of Pizarro had been.</p>
   <p>"Okay," said Tanner finally. "Maybe I'm overreacting. Maybe I'm sounding like the ignoramus layman that I am. I'll take it on faith that you'll be able to keep your phantoms in their boxes."</p>
   <p>"We will," Richardson said.</p>
   <p>"Let's hope so. All right," said Tanner. "So what's your next move?"</p>
   <p>Richardson looked puzzled. "My next move?"</p>
   <p>"With this project? Where does it go from here?"</p>
   <p>Hesitantly Richardson said, "There's no formal proposal yet. We thought we'd wait until we had approval from you on the initial phase of the work, and then - "</p>
   <p>"How does this sound?" Tanner asked. "I'd like to see you start in on another simulation right away."</p>
   <p>"Well - yes, yes, of course - "</p>
   <p>"And when you've got him worked up, Lew, would it be feasible for you to put him right there in the tank with Pizarro?"</p>
   <p>Richardson looked startled. "To have a sort of dialog with him, you mean?"</p>
   <p>"Yes."</p>
   <p>"I suppose we could do that," Richardson said cautiously. "Should do that. Yes. Yes. A very interesting suggestion, as a matter of fact." He ventured an uneasy smile. Up till now Tanner had kept in the background of this project, a mere management functionary, an observer, virtually an outsider. This was something new, his interjecting himself into the planning process, and plainly Richardson didn't know what to make of it. Tanner watched him fidget. After a little pause Richardson said, "Was there anyone particular you had in mind for us to try next?"</p>
   <p>"Is that new parallax thing of yours ready to try?" Tanner asked. "The one that's supposed to compensate for time distortion and myth contamination?"</p>
   <p>"Just about. But we haven't tested - "</p>
   <p>"Good," Tanner said. "Here's your chance. What about trying for Socrates?"</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>There was billowing whiteness below him, and on every side, as though all the world were made of fleece. He wondered if it might be snow. That was not something he was really familiar with. It snowed once in a great while in Athens, yes, but usually only a light dusting that melted in the morning sun. Of course he had seen snow aplenty when he had been up north in the war, at Potidaea, in the time of Pericles. But that had been long ago; and that stuff, as best he remembered it, had not been much like this. There was no quality of coldness about the whiteness that surrounded him now. It could just as readily be great banks of clouds.</p>
   <p>But what would clouds be doing below him? Clouds, he thought, are mere vapor, air and water, no substance to them at all. Their natural place was overhead. Clouds that gathered at one's feet had no true quality of cloudness about them.</p>
   <p>Snow that had no coldness? Clouds that had no buoyancy? Nothing in this place seemed to possess any quality that was proper to itself in this place, including himself. He seemed to be walking, but his feet touched nothing at all. It was more like moving through air. But how could one move in the air? Aristophanes, in that mercilessly mocking play of his, had sent him floating through the clouds suspended in a basket, and made him say things like, "I am traversing the air and contemplating the sun." That was Aristophanes' way of playing with him, and he had not been seriously upset, though his friends had been very hurt on his behalf. Still, that was only a play.</p>
   <p>This felt real, insofar as it felt like anything at all.</p>
   <p>Perhaps he was dreaming, and the nature of his dream was that he thought he was really doing the things he had done in Aristophanes' play. What was that lovely line? "I have to suspend my brain and mingle the subtle essence of my mind with this air, which is of the same nature, in order clearly to penetrate the things of heaven." Good old Aristophanes! Nothing was sacred to him! Except, of course, those things that were truly sacred, such as wisdom, truth, virtue. "I would have discovered nothing if I had remained on the ground and pondered from below the things that are above: for the earth by its force attracts the sap of the mind to itself. It's the same way with watercress." And Socrates began to laugh.</p>
   <p>He held his hands before him and studied them, the short sturdy fingers, the thick powerful wrists. His hands, yes. His old plain hands that had stood him in good stead all his life, when he had worked as a stonemason as his father had, when he had fought in his city's wars, when he had trained at the gymnasium. But now when he touched them to his face he felt nothing. There should be a chin here, a forehead, yes, a blunt stubby nose, thick lips; but there was nothing. He was touching air. He could put his hand right through the place where his face should be. He could put one hand against the other, and press with all his might, and feel nothing.</p>
   <p>This is a very strange place indeed, he thought.</p>
   <p>Perhaps it is that place of pure forms that young Plato liked to speculate about, where everything is perfect and nothing is quite real. Those are ideal clouds all around me, not real ones. This is ideal air upon which I walk. I myself am the ideal Socrates, liberated from my coarse ordinary body. Could it be? Well, maybe so. He stood for a while, considering that possibility. The thought came to him that this might be the life after life, in which case he might meet some of the gods, if there were any gods in the first place, and if he could manage to find them. I would like that, he thought. Perhaps they would be willing to speak with me. Athena would discourse with me on wisdom, or Hermes on speed, or Ares on the nature of courage, or Zeus on - well, whatever Zeus cared to speak on. Of course I would seem to be the merest fool to them, but that would be all right: anyone who expects to hold discourse with the gods as though he were their equal is a fool. I have no such illusion. If there are gods at all, surely they are far superior to me in all respects, for otherwise why would men regard them as gods?</p>
   <p>Of course he had serious doubts that the gods existed at all. But if they did, it was reasonable to think that they might be found in a place such as this.</p>
   <p>He looked up. The sky was radiant with brilliant golden light. He took a deep breath and smiled and set out across the fleecy nothingness of this airy world to see if he could find the gods.</p>

   <p>Tanner said, "What do you think now? Still so pessimistic?"</p>
   <p>"It's too early to say," said Richardson, looking glum.</p>
   <p>"He looks like Socrates, doesn't he?"</p>
   <p>"That was the easy part. We've got plenty of descriptions of Socrates that came down from people who knew him, the flat wide nose, the bald head, the thick lips, the short neck. A standard Socrates face that everybody recognizes, just as they do Sherlock Holmes, or Don Quixote. So that's how we made him look. It doesn't signify anything important. It's what's going on inside his head that'll determine whether we really have Socrates."</p>
   <p>"He seems calm and good-humored as he wanders around in there. The way a philosopher should."</p>
   <p>"Pizarro seemed just as much of a philosopher when we turned him loose in the tank."</p>
   <p>"Pizarro may be just as much of a philosopher," Tanner said. "Neither man's the sort who'd be likely to panic if he found himself in some mysterious place." Richardson's negativism was beginning to bother him. It was as if the two men had exchanged places: Richardson now uncertain of the range and power of his own program, Tanner pushing the way on and on toward bigger and better things.</p>
   <p>Bleakly Richardson said, "I'm still pretty skeptical. We've tried the new parallax filters, yes. But I'm afraid we're going to run into the same problem the French did with Don Quixote, and that we did with Holmes and Moses and Caesar. There's too much contamination of the data by myth and fantasy. The Socrates who has come down to us is as much fictional as real, or maybe all fictional. For all we know, Plato made up everything we think we know about him, the same way Conan Doyle made up Holmes. And what we're going to get, I'm afraid, will be something second-hand, something lifeless, something lacking in the spark of self-directed intelligence that we're after."</p>
   <p>"But the new filters - "</p>
   <p>"Perhaps. Perhaps."</p>
   <p>Tanner shook his head stubbornly. "Holmes and Don Quixote are fiction through and through. They exist in only one dimension, constructed for us by their authors. You cut through the distortions and fantasies of later readers and commentators and all you find underneath is a made-up character. A lot of Socrates may have been invented by Plato for his own purposes, but a lot wasn't. He really existed. He took an actual part in civic activities in fifth-century Athens. He figures in books by a lot of other contemporaries of his besides Plato's dialogues. That gives us the parallax you're looking for, doesn't it - the view of him from more than one viewpoint?"</p>
   <p>"Maybe it does. Maybe not. We got nowhere with Moses. Was he fictional?"</p>
   <p>"Who can say? All you had to go by was the Bible. And a ton of Biblical commentary, for whatever that was worth. Not much, apparently."</p>
   <p>"And Caesar? You're not going to tell me that Caesar wasn't real," said Richardson. "But what we have of him is evidently contaminated with myth. When we synthesized him we got nothing but a caricature, and I don't have to remind you how fast even that broke down into sheer gibberish."</p>
   <p>"Not relevant," Tanner said. "Caesar was early in the project. You know much more about what you're doing now. I think this is going to work."</p>
   <p>Richardson's dogged pessimism, Tanner decided, must be a defense mechanism, designed to insulate himself against the possibility of a new failure. Socrates, after all, hadn't been Richardson's own choice. And this was the first time he had used these new enhancement methods, the parallax program that was the latest refinement of the process.</p>
   <p>Tanner looked at him. Richardson remained silent.</p>
   <p>"Go on," Tanner said. "Bring up Pizarro and let the two of them talk to each other. Then we'll find out what sort of Socrates you've conjured up here."</p>

   <p>Once again there was a disturbance in the distance, a little dark blur on the pearly horizon, a blotch, a flaw in the gleaming whiteness. Another demon is arriving, Pizarro thought. Or perhaps it is the same one as before, the American, the one who liked to show himself only as a face, with short hair and no beard.</p>
   <p>But as this one drew closer Pizarro saw that he was different from the last, short and stocky, with broad shoulders and a deep chest. He was nearly bald and his thick beard was coarse and unkempt. He looked old, at least sixty, maybe sixty-five. He looked very ugly, too, with bulging eyes and a flat nose that had wide, flaring nostrils, and a neck so short that his oversized head seemed to sprout straight from his trunk. All he wore was a thin, ragged brown robe. His feet were bare.</p>
   <p>"You, there," Pizarro called out. "You! Demon! Are you also an American, demon?"</p>
   <p>"Your pardon. An Athenian, did you say?"</p>
   <p>"American is what I said. That's what the last one was. Is that where you come from too, demon? America?"</p>
   <p>A shrug. "No, I think not. I am of Athens." There was a curious mocking twinkle in the demon's eyes.</p>
   <p>"A Greek? This demon is a Greek?"</p>
   <p>"I am of Athens," the ugly one said again. "My name is Socrates, the son of Sophroniscus. I could not tell you what a Greek is, so perhaps I may be one, but I think not, unless a Greek is what you call a man of Athens." He spoke in a slow, plodding way, like one who was exceedingly stupid. Pizarro had sometimes met men like this before, and in his experience they were generally not as stupid as they wanted to be taken for. He felt caution rising in him. "And I am no demon, but just a plain man: very plain, as you can easily see."</p>
   <p>Pizarro snorted. "You like to chop words, do you?"</p>
   <p>"It is not the worst of amusements, my friend," said the other, and put his hands together behind his back in the most casual way, and stood there calmly, smiling, looking off into the distance, rocking back and forth on the balls of his feet.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>"Well?" Tanner said. "Do we have Socrates or not? I say that's the genuine article there."</p>
   <p>Richardson looked up and nodded. He seemed relieved and quizzical both at once. "So far so good, I have to say. He's coming through real and true."</p>
   <p>"Yes."</p>
   <p>"We may actually have worked past the problem of information contamination that ruined some of the earlier simulations. We're not getting any of the signal degradation we encountered then."</p>
   <p>"He's some character, isn't he?" Tanner said. "I liked the way he just walked right up to Pizarro without the slightest sign of uneasiness. He's not at all afraid of him."</p>
   <p>"Why should he be?" Richardson asked.</p>
   <p>"Wouldn't you? If you were walking along through God knows what kind of unearthly place, not knowing where you were or how you got there, and suddenly you saw a ferocious-looking bastard like Pizarro standing in front of you wearing full armor and carrying a sword - " Tanner shook his head. "Well, maybe not. He's Socrates, after all, and Socrates wasn't afraid of anything except boredom."</p>
   <p>"And Pizarro's just a simulation. Nothing but software."</p>
   <p>"So you've been telling me all along. But Socrates doesn't know that."</p>
   <p>"True," Richardson said. He seemed lost in thought a moment. "Perhaps there is some risk."</p>
   <p>"Huh?"</p>
   <p>"If our Socrates is anything like the one in Plato, and he surely ought to be, then he's capable of making a considerable pest of himself. Pizarro may not care for Socrates' little verbal games. If he doesn't feel like playing, I suppose there's a theoretical possibility that he'll engage in some sort of aggressive response."</p>
   <p>That took Tanner by surprise. He swung around and said, "Are you telling me that there's some way he can harm Socrates?"</p>
   <p>"Who knows?" said Richardson. "In the real world one program can certainly crash another one. Maybe one simulation can be dangerous to another one. This is all new territory for all of us, Harry. Including the people in the tank."</p>

   <p>The tall grizzled-looking man, said, scowling,"You tell me you're an Athenian, but not a Greek. What sense am I supposed to make of that? I could ask Pedro de Candia, I guess, who is a Greek but not an Athenian. But he's not here. Perhaps you're just a fool, eh? Or you think I am."</p>
   <p>"I have no idea what you are. Could it be that you are a god?"</p>
   <p>"A god?"</p>
   <p>"Yes," Socrates said. He studied the other impassively. His face was harsh, his gaze was cold. "Perhaps you are Ares. You have a fierce warlike look about you, and you wear armor, but not such armor as I have ever seen. This place is so strange that it might well be the abode of the gods, and that could be a god's armor you wear, I suppose. If you are Ares, then I salute you with the respect that is due you. I am Socrates of Athens, the stonemason's son."</p>
   <p>"You talk a lot of nonsense. I don't know your Ares."</p>
   <p>"Why, the god of war, of course! Everyone knows that. Except barbarians, that is. Are you a barbarian, then? You sound like one, I must say - but then, I seem to sound like a barbarian myself, and I've spoken the tongue of Hellas all my life. There are many mysteries here, indeed."</p>

   <p>"Your language problem again," Tanner said. "Couldn't you even get classical Greek to come out right? Or are they both speaking Spanish to each other?"</p>
   <p>"Pizarro thinks they're speaking Spanish. Socrates thinks they're speaking Greek. And of course the Greek is off. We don't know how anything that was spoken before the age of recordings sounded. All we can do is guess."</p>
   <p>"But can't you - "</p>
   <p>"Shhh," Richardson said.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <subtitle>****</subtitle>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Pizarro said, "I may be a bastard, but I'm no barbarian, fellow, so curb your tongue. And let's have no more blasphemy out of you either."</p>
   <p>"If I blaspheme, forgive me. It is in innocence. Tell me where I trespass, and I will not do it again."</p>
   <p>"This crazy talk of gods. Of my being a god. I'd expect a heathen to talk like that, but not a Greek. But maybe you're a heathen kind of Greek, and not to be blamed. It's heathens who see gods everywhere. Do I look like a god to you? I am Francisco Pizarro, of Trujillo in Estremadura, the son of the famous soldier Gonzalo Pizarro, colonel of infantry, who served in the wars of Gonzalo de Cordova whom men call the Great Captain. I have fought some wars myself."</p>
   <p>"Then you are not a god but simply a soldier? Good. I too have been a soldier. I am more at ease with soldiers than with gods, as most people are, I would think."</p>
   <p>"A soldier? You?" Pizarro smiled. This shabby ordinary little man, more bedraggled-looking than any self-respecting groom would be, a soldier? "In which wars?"</p>
   <p>"The wars of Athens. I fought at Potidaea, where the Corinthians were making trouble, and withholding the tribute that was due us. It was very cold there, and the siege was long and bleak, but we did our duty. I fought again some years later at Delium against the Boeotians. Laches was our general then, but it went badly for us, and we did our best fighting in retreat. And then," Socrates said, "when Brasidas was in Amphipolis, and they sent Cleon to drive him out, I - "</p>
   <p>"Enough," said Pizarro with an impatient wave of his hand. "These wars are unknown to me." A private soldier, a man of the ranks, no doubt. "Well, then this is the place where they send dead soldiers, I suppose."</p>
   <p>"Are we dead, then?"</p>
   <p>"Long ago. There's an Alfonso who's king, and a Pius who's pope, and you wouldn't believe their numbers. Pius the Sixteenth, I think the demon said. And the American said also that it is the year 2l30. The last year that I can remember was l539. What about you?"</p>
   <p>The one who called himself Socrates shrugged again. "In Athens we use a different reckoning. But let us say, for argument's sake, that we are dead. I think that is very likely, considering what sort of place this seems to be, and how airy I find my body to be. So we have died, and this is the life after life. I wonder: is this a place where virtuous men are sent, or those who were not virtuous? Or do all men go to the same place after death, whether they were virtuous or not? What would you say?"</p>
   <p>"I haven't figured that out yet," said Pizarro.</p>
   <p>"Well, were you virtuous in your life, or not?"</p>
   <p>"Did I sin, you mean?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, we could use that word."</p>
   <p>"Did I sin, he wants to know," said Pizarro, amazed. "He asks, Was I a sinner? Did I live a virtuous life? What business is that of his?"</p>
   <p>"Humor me," said Socrates. "For the sake of the argument, if you will, allow me a few small questions - "</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>"So it's starting," Tanner said. "You see? You really did do it! Socrates is drawing him into a dialog!"</p>
   <p>Richardson's eyes were glowing. "He is, yes. How marvelous this is, Harry!"</p>
   <p>"Socrates is going to talk rings around him."</p>
   <p>"I'm not so sure of that," Richardson said.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <subtitle>****</subtitle>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>"I gave as good as I got," said Pizarro. "If I was injured, I gave injury back. There's no sin in that. It's only common sense. A man does what is necessary to survive and to protect his place in the world. Sometimes I might forget a fast day, yes, or use the Lord's name in vain - those are sins, I suppose, Fray Vicente was always after me for things like that - but does that make me a sinner? I did my penances as soon as I could find time for them. It's a sinful world and I'm no different from anyone else, so why be harsh on me? Eh? God made me as I am. I'm done in His image. And I have faith in His Son."</p>
   <p>"So you are a virtuous man, then?"</p>
   <p>"I'm not a sinner, at any rate. As I told you, if ever I sinned I did my contrition, which made it the same as if the sin hadn't ever happened."</p>
   <p>"Indeed," said Socrates. "Then you are a virtuous man and I have come to a good place. But I want to be absolutely sure. Tell me again: is your conscience completely clear?"</p>
   <p>"What are you, a confessor?"</p>
   <p>"Only an ignorant man seeking understanding. Which you can provide, by taking part with me in the exploration. If I have come to the place of virtuous men, then I must have been virtuous myself when I lived. Ease my mind, therefore, and let me know whether there is anything on your soul that you regret having done."</p>
   <p>Pizarro stirred uneasily. "Well," he said, "I killed a king."</p>
   <p>"A wicked one? An enemy of your city?"</p>
   <p>"No. He was wise and kind."</p>
   <p>"Then you have reason for regret indeed. For surely that is a sin, to kill a wise king."</p>
   <p>"But he was a heathen."</p>
   <p>"A what?"</p>
   <p>"He denied God."</p>
   <p>"He denied his own god?" said Socrates. "Then perhaps it was not so wrong to kill him."</p>
   <p>"No. He denied mine. He preferred his own. And so he was a heathen. And all his people were heathens, since they followed his way. That could not be. They were at risk of eternal damnation because they followed him. I killed him for the sake of his people's souls. I killed him out of the love of God."</p>
   <p>"But would you not say that all gods are the reflection of the one God?"</p>
   <p>Pizarro considered that. "In a way, that's true, I suppose."</p>
   <p>"And is the service of God not itself godly?"</p>
   <p>"How could it be anything but godly, Socrates?"</p>
   <p>"And you would say that one who serves his god faithfully according to the teachings of his god is behaving in a godly way?"</p>
   <p>Frowning, Pizarro said, "Well - if you look at it that way, yes - "</p>
   <p>"Then I think the king you killed was a godly man, and by killing him you sinned against God."</p>
   <p>"Wait a minute!"</p>
   <p>"But think of it: by serving his god he must also have served yours, for any servant of a god is a servant of the true God who encompasses all our imagined gods."</p>
   <p>"No," said Pizarro sullenly. "How could he have been a servant of God? He knew nothing of Jesus. He had no understanding of the Trinity. When the priest offered him the Bible, he threw it to the ground in scorn. He was a heathen, Socrates. And so are you. You don't know anything of these matters at all, if you think that Atahuallpa was godly. Or if you think you're going to get me to think so."</p>
   <p>"Indeed I have very little knowledge of anything. But you say he was a wise man, and kind?"</p>
   <p>"In his heathen way."</p>
   <p>"And a good king to his people?"</p>
   <p>"So it seemed. They were a thriving people when I found them."</p>
   <p>"Yet he was not godly."</p>
   <p>"I told you. He had never had the sacraments, and in fact he spurned them right up until the moment of his death, when he accepted baptism. Then he came to be godly. But by then the sentence of death was upon him and it was too late for anything to save him."</p>
   <p>"Baptism? Tell me what that is, Pizarro."</p>
   <p>"A sacrament."</p>
   <p>"And that is?"</p>
   <p>"A holy rite. Done with holy water, by a priest. It admits one to Holy Mother Church, and brings forgiveness from sin both original and actual, and gives the gift of the Holy Spirit."</p>
   <p>"You must tell me more about these things another time. So you made this good king godly by this baptism? And then you killed him?"</p>
   <p>"Yes."</p>
   <p>"But he was godly when you killed him. Surely, then, to kill him was a sin."</p>
   <p>"He had to die, Socrates!"</p>
   <p>"And why was that?" asked the Athenian.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <subtitle>****</subtitle>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>"Socrates is closing in for the kill," Tanner said. "Watch this!"</p>
   <p>"I'm watching. But there isn't going to be any kill," said Richardson. "Their basic assumptions are too far apart."</p>
   <p>"You'll see."</p>
   <p>"Will I?"</p>
   <empty-line/>

   <p>Pizarro said, "I've already told you why he had to die. It was because his people followed him in all things. And so they worshipped the sun, because he said the sun was God. Their souls would have gone to hell if we had allowed them to continue that way."</p>
   <p>"But if they followed him in all things," said Socrates, "then surely they would have followed him into baptism, and become godly, and thus done that which was pleasing to you and to your god! Is that not so?"</p>
   <p>"No," said Pizarro, twisting his fingers in his beard.</p>
   <p>"Why do you think that?"</p>
   <p>"Because the king agreed to be baptized only after we had sentenced him to death. He was in the way, don't you see? He was an obstacle to our power! So we had to get rid of him. He would never have led his people to the truth of his own free will. That was why we had to kill him. But we didn't want to kill his soul as well as his body, so we said to him, Look, Atahuallpa, we're going to put you to death, but if you let us baptize you we'll strangle you quickly, and if you don't we'll burn you alive and it'll be very slow. So of course he agreed to be baptized, and we strangled him. What choice was there for anybody? He had to die. He still didn't believe the true faith, as we all well knew. Inside his head he was as big a heathen as ever. But he died a Christian all the same."</p>
   <p>"A what?"</p>
   <p>"A Christian! A Christian! One who believes in Jesus Christ the Son of God!"</p>
   <p>"The son of God," Socrates said, sounding puzzled. "And do Christians believe in God too, or only his son?"</p>
   <p>"What a fool you are!"</p>
   <p>"I would not deny that."</p>
   <p>"There is God the Father, and God the Son, and then there is the Holy Spirit."</p>
   <p>"Ah," said Socrates. "And which one did your Atahuallpa believe in, then, when the strangler came for him?"</p>
   <p>"None of them."</p>
   <p>"And yet he died a Christian? Without believing in any of your three gods? How is that?"</p>
   <p>"Because of the baptism," said Pizarro in rising annoyance. "What does it matter what he believed? The priest sprinkled the water on him! The priest said the words! If the rite is properly performed, the soul is saved regardless of what the man understands or believes! How else could you baptize an infant? An infant understands nothing and believes nothing - but he becomes a Christian when the water touches him!"</p>
   <p>"Much of this is mysterious to me," said Socrates. "But I see that you regard the king you killed as godly as well as wise, because he was washed by the water your gods require, and so you killed a good king who now lived in the embrace of your gods because of the baptism. Which seems wicked to me; and so this cannot be the place where the virtuous are sent after death, so it must be that I too was not virtuous, or else that I have misunderstood everything about this place and why we are in it."</p>
   <p>"Damn you, are you trying to drive me crazy?" Pizarro roared, fumbling at the hilt of his sword. He drew it and waved it around in fury. "If you don't shut your mouth I'll cut you in thirds!"</p>

   <p>Socrates said mildly, "It isn't my intention to cause you any annoyance, my friend. I'm only trying to learn a few things."</p>
   <p>"You are a fool!"</p>
   <p>"That is certainly true, as I have already acknowledged several times. Well, if you mean to strike me with your sword, go ahead. But I don't think it'll accomplish very much."</p>
   <p>"Damn you," Pizarro muttered. He stared at his sword and shook his head. "No. No, it won't do any good, will it? It would go through you like air. But you'd just stand there and let me try to cut you down, and not even blink, right? Right?" He shook his head. "And yet you aren't stupid. You argue like the shrewdest priest I've ever known."</p>
   <p>"In truth I am stupid," said Socrates. "I know very little at all. But I strive constantly to attain some understanding of the world, or at least to understand something of myself."</p>
   <p>Pizarro glared at him. "No," he said. "I won't buy this false pride of yours. I have a little understanding of people myself, old man. I'm on to your game."</p>
   <p>"What game is that, Pizarro?"</p>
   <p>"I can see your arrogance. I see that you believe you're the wisest man in the world, and that it's your mission to go around educating poor sword-waving fools like me. And you pose as a fool to disarm your adversaries before you humiliate them."</p>

   <p>"Score one for Pizarro," Richardson said. "He's wise to Socrates' little tricks, all right."</p>
   <p>"Maybe he's read some Plato," Tanner suggested.</p>
   <p>"He was illiterate."</p>
   <p>"That was then. This is now."</p>
   <p>"Not guilty," said Richardson. "He's operating on peasant shrewdness alone, and you damned well know it."</p>
   <p>"I wasn't being serious," Tanner said. He leaned forward, peering toward the holotank. "God, what an astonishing thing this is, listening to them going at it. They seem absolutely real."</p>
   <p>"They are," said Richardson.</p>

   <subtitle>****</subtitle>

   <p>"No, Pizarro, I am not wise at all," Socrates said. "But, stupid as I am, it may be that I am not the least wise man who ever lived."</p>
   <p>"You think you're wiser than I am, don't you?"</p>
   <p>"How can I say? First tell me how wise you are."</p>
   <p>"Wise enough to begin my life as a bastard tending pigs and finish it as Captain-General of Peru."</p>
   <p>"Ah, then you must be very wise."</p>
   <p>"I think so, yes."</p>
   <p>"Yet you killed a wise king because he wasn't wise enough to worship God the way you wished him to. Was that so wise of you, Pizarro? How did his people take it, when they found out that their king had been killed?"</p>
   <p>"They rose in rebellion against us. They destroyed their own temples and palaces, and hid their gold and silver from us, and burned their bridges, and fought us bitterly."</p>
   <p>"Perhaps you could have made some better use of him by not killing him, do you think?"</p>
   <p>"In the long run we conquered them and made them Christians. It was what we intended to accomplish."</p>
   <p>"But the same thing might have been accomplished in a wiser way?"</p>
   <p>"Perhaps," said Pizarro grudgingly. "Still, we accomplished it. That's the main thing, isn't it? We did what we set out to do. If there was a better way, so be it. Angels do things perfectly. We were no angels, but we achieved what we came for, and so be it, Socrates. So be it."</p>

   <p>"I'd call that one a draw," said Tanner.</p>
   <p>"Agreed."</p>
   <p>"It's a terrific game they're playing."</p>
   <p>"I wonder who we can use to play it next," said Richardson.</p>
   <p>"I wonder what we can do with this besides using it to play games," said Tanner.</p>

   <p>"Let me tell you a story," said Socrates. "The oracle at Delphi once said to a friend of mine, 'There is no man wiser than Socrates,' but I doubted that very much, and it troubled me to hear the oracle saying something that I knew was so far from the truth. So I decided to look for a man who was obviously wiser than I was. There was a politician in Athens who was famous for his wisdom, and I went to him and questioned him about many things. After I had listened to him for a time, I came to see that though many people, and most of all he himself, thought that he was wise, yet he was not wise. He only imagined that he was wise. So I realized that I must be wiser than he. Neither of us knew anything that was really worthwhile, but he knew nothing and thought that he knew, whereas I neither knew anything nor thought that I did. At least on one point, then, I was wiser than he: I didn't think that I knew what I didn't know."</p>
   <p>"Is this intended to mock me, Socrates?"</p>
   <p>"I feel only the deepest respect for you, friend Pizarro. But let me continue. I went to other wise men, and they too, though sure of their wisdom, could never give me a clear answer to anything. Those whose reputations for wisdom were the highest seemed to have the least of it. I went to the great poets and playwrights. There was wisdom in their works, for the gods had inspired them, but that did not make them wise, though they thought that it had. I went to the stonemasons and potters and other craftsmen. They were wise in their own skills, but most of them seemed to think that that made them wise in everything, which did not appear to be the case. And so it went. I was unable to find anyone who showed true wisdom. So perhaps the oracle was right: that although I am an ignorant man, there is no man wiser than I am. But oracles often are right without their being much value in it, for I think that all she was saying was that no man is wise at all, that wisdom is reserved for the gods. What do you say, Pizarro?"</p>
   <p>"I say that you are a great fool, and very ugly besides."</p>
   <p>"You speak the truth. So, then, you are wise after all. And honest."</p>
   <p>"Honest, you say? I won't lay claim to that. Honesty's a game for fools. I lied whenever I needed to. I cheated. I went back on my word. I'm not proud of that, mind you. It's simply what you have to do to get on in the world. You think I wanted to tend pigs all my life? I wanted gold, Socrates! I wanted power over men! I wanted fame!"</p>
   <p>"And did you get those things?"</p>
   <p>"I got them all."</p>
   <p>"And were they gratifying, Pizarro?"</p>
   <p>Pizarro gave Socrates a long look. Then he pursed his lips and spat.</p>
   <p>"They were worthless."</p>
   <p>"Were they, do you think?"</p>
   <p>"Worthless, yes. I have no illusions about that. But still it was better to have had them than not. In the long run nothing has any meaning, old man. In the long run we're all dead, the honest man and the villain, the king and the fool. Life's a cheat. They tell us to strive, to conquer, to gain - and for what? What? For a few years of strutting around. Then it's taken away, as if it had never been. A cheat, I say." Pizarro paused. He stared at his hands as though he had never seen them before. "Did I say all that just now? Did I mean it?" He laughed. "Well, I suppose I did. Still, life is all there is, so you want as much of it as you can. Which means getting gold, and power, and fame."</p>
   <p>"Which you had. And apparently have no longer. Friend Pizarro, where are we now?"</p>
   <p>"I wish I knew."</p>
   <p>"So do I," said Socrates soberly.</p>

   <p>"He's real," Richardson said. "They both are. The bugs are out of the system and we've got something spectacular here. Not only is this going to be of value to scholars, I think it's also going to be a tremendous entertainment gimmick, Harry."</p>
   <p>"It's going to be much more than that," said Tanner in a strange voice.</p>
   <p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>
   <p>"I'm not sure yet," Tanner said. "But I'm definitely on to something big. It just began to hit me a couple of minutes ago, and it hasn't really taken shape yet. But it's something that might change the whole goddamned world."</p>
   <p>Richardson looked amazed and bewildered.</p>
   <p>"What the hell are you talking about, Harry?"</p>
   <p>Tanner said, "A new way of settling political disputes, maybe. What would you say to a kind of combat-at-arms between one nation and another? Like a medieval tournament, so to speak. With each side using champions that we simulate for them - the greatest minds of all the past, brought back and placed in competition - " He shook his head. "Something like that. It needs a lot of working out, I know. But it's got possibilities."</p>
   <p>"A medieval tournament - combat-at-arms, using simulations? Is that what you're saying?"</p>
   <p>"Verbal combat. Not actual jousts, for Christ's sake."</p>
   <p>"I don't see how - " Richardson began.</p>
   <p>"Neither do I, not yet. I wish I hadn't even spoken of it."</p>
   <p>"But - "</p>
   <p>"Later, Lew. Later. Let me think about it a little while more."</p>

   <p>"You don't have any idea what this place is?" Pizarro said.</p>
   <p>"Not at all. But I certainly think this is no longer the world where we once dwelled. Are we dead, then? How can we say? You look alive to me."</p>
   <p>"And you to me."</p>
   <p>"Yet I think we are living some other kind of life. Here, give me your hand. Can you feel mine against yours?"</p>
   <p>"No. I can't feel anything."</p>
   <p>"Nor I. Yet I see two hands clasping. Two old men standing on a cloud, clasping hands." Socrates laughed. "What a great rogue you are, Pizarro!"</p>
   <p>"Yes, of course. But do you know something, Socrates? You are too. A windy old rogue. I like you. There were moments when you were driving me crazy with all your chatter, but you amused me too. Were you really a soldier?"</p>
   <p>"When my city asked me, yes."</p>
   <p>"For a soldier, you're damned innocent about the way the world works, I have to say. But I guess I can teach you a thing or too."</p>
   <p>"Will you?"</p>
   <p>"Gladly," said Pizarro.</p>
   <p>"I would be in your debt," Socrates said.</p>
   <p>"Take Atahuallpa," Pizarro said. "How can I make you understand why I had to kill him? There weren't even two hundred of us, and twenty-four millions of them, and his word was law, and once he was gone they'd have no one to command them. So of course we had to get rid of him if we wanted to conquer them. And so we did, and then they fell."</p>
   <p>"How simple you make it seem."</p>
   <p>"Simple is what it was. Listen, old man, he would have died sooner or later anyway, wouldn't he? This way I made his death useful: to God, to the Church, to Spain. And to Francisco Pizarro. Can you understand that?"</p>
   <p>"I think so," said Socrates. "But do you think King Atahuallpa did?"</p>
   <p>"Any king would understand such things."</p>
   <p>"Then he should have killed you the moment you set foot in his land."</p>
   <p>"Unless God meant us to conquer him, and allowed him to understand that. Yes. Yes, that must have been what happened."</p>
   <p>"Perhaps he is in this place too, and we could ask him," said Socrates.</p>
   <p>Pizarro's eyes brightened. "Mother of God, yes! A good idea! And if he didn't understand, why, I'll try to explain it to him. Maybe you'll help me. You know how to talk, how to move words around and around. What do you say? Would you help me?"</p>
   <p>"If we meet him, I would like to talk with him," Socrates said. "I would indeed like to know if he agrees with you on the subject of the usefulness of his being killed by you."</p>
   <p>Grinning, Pizarro said, "Slippery, you are! But I like you. I like you very much. Come. Let's go look for Atahuallpa."</p>
