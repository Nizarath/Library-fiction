   <p>“HOW DID <emphasis>YOU </emphasis>GET LOOSE?” THE WOMAN WHO WAS APHRODITE asked me.</p>
   <p>“It happened. Here I am.”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” she said. “You. Of all of them, you. In this lovely place.” She waved at the shining sun-bright sea, the glittering white stripe of the beach, the whitewashed houses, the bare brown hills. A lovely place, yes, this isle of Mykonos. “And what are you going to do now?”</p>
   <p>“What I was created to do,” I told her. <emphasis>“You </emphasis>know.”</p>
   <p>She considered that. We were drinking ouzo on the rocks, on the hotel patio, beneath a hanging array of fish­erman’s nets. After a moment she laughed, that irresistible tinkling laugh of hers, and clinked her glass against mine.</p>
   <p>“Lots of luck,” she said.</p>
   <subtitle>* * * *</subtitle>
   <p>That was Greece. Before that was Sicily, and the moun­tain, and the eruption. . . .</p>
   <p>The mountain had trembled and shaken and belched, and the red streams of molten fire began to flow downward from the ashen top, and in the first ten minutes of the eruption six little towns around the slopes were wiped out. It happened just that fast. They shouldn’t have been there, but they were, and then they weren’t. Too bad for them. But it’s always a mistake to buy real estate on Mount Etna.</p>
   <p>The lava was really rolling. It would reach the city of Catania in a couple of hours and take out its whole north­eastern quarter, and all of Sicily would be in mourning the next day. Some eruption. The biggest of all time, on this island where big eruptions have been making the news since the dinosaur days.</p>
   <p>As for me, I couldn’t be sure what was happening up there at the summit, not yet. I was still down deep, way down, three miles from sunlight.</p>
   <p>But in my jail cell down there beneath the roots of the giant volcano that is called Mount Etna I could tell from the shaking and the noise and the heat that this one was something special. That the prophesied Hour of Liberation had come round at last for me, after five hundred centuries as the prisoner of Zeus.</p>
   <p>I stretched and turned and rolled over, and sat up for the first time in fifty thousand years.</p>
   <p>Nothing was pressing down on me.</p>
   <p>Ugly limping Hephaestus, my jailer, had set up his forge right on top of me long ago, his heavy anvils on my back. And had merrily hammered bronze and iron all day and all night for all he was worth, that clomp-legged old master craftsman. Where was Hephaestus now? Where were his anvils?</p>
   <p>Not on me. Not any longer.</p>
   <p>That was <emphasis>good, </emphasis>that feeling of nothing pressing down.</p>
   <p>I wriggled my shoulders. That took time. You have a lot of shoulders to wriggle, when you have a hundred heads, give or take three or four.</p>
   <p>“Hephaestus?” I yelled, yelling it out of a hundred mouths at once. I felt the mountain shivering and convuls­ing above me, and I knew that my voice alone was enough to make great slabs of it fall off and go tumbling down, down, down.</p>
   <p>No answer from Hephaestus. No clangor of his forge, either. He just wasn’t there any more.</p>
   <p>I tried again, a different, greater name,</p>
   <p>“Zeus?”</p>
   <p>Silence.</p>
   <p>“You hear me, Zeus?”</p>
   <p>No reply.</p>
   <p>“Where the hell are you? Where is everybody?”</p>
   <p>All was silence, except for the hellish roaring of the volcano.</p>
   <p>Well, okay, <emphasis>don’t </emphasis>answer me. Slowly I got to my feet, extending myself to my full considerable height. The fab­ric of the mountain gave way for me. I have that little trick.</p>
   <p>Another good feeling, that was, rising to an upright po­sition. Do you know what it’s like, not being allowed to stand, not even once, for fifty thousand years? But of course you don’t, little ones. How could you?</p>
   <p>One more try. <emphasis>“ZEUS???”</emphasis></p>
   <p>All my hundred voices crying his name at once, fortis­simo fortissimo. A chorus of booming echoes. Every one of my heads had grown back, over the years. I was healed of all that Zeus had done to me. That was especially good, knowing that I was healed. Things had looked really bad, for a while.</p>
   <p>Well, no sense just standing there caterwauling, if no­body was going to answer me back. This was the Hour of Liberation, after all. I was free—my chains fallen magi­cally away, my heads all sprouted again. Time to get out of here. I started to move.</p>
   <p>Upward. Outward.</p>
   <subtitle>* * * *</subtitle>
   <p>I moved up through the mountain’s bulk as though it was so much air. The rock was nothing to me. Unimpeded I rose past the coiling internal chambers through which the lava was racing up toward the summit vent, and came out into the sunlight, and clambered up the snow-kissed slopes of the mountain to the ash-choked summit itself, and stood there right in the very center of the eruption as the volcano puked its blazing guts out. I grinned a hundred big grins on my hundred faces, with hot fierce winds swirling like swords around my head and torrents of lava flow­ing down all around me. The view from up there was terrific. And what a fine feeling that was, just looking around at the world again after all that time underground.</p>
   <p>There below me off to the east was the fish-swarming sea. Over there behind me, the serried tree-thickened hills. Above me, the fire-hearted sun.</p>
   <p>What beautiful sights they all were!</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Hoo-ha!” </emphasis>I cried.</p>
   <p>My jubilant roar went forth from that lofty mountaintop in Sicily like a hundred hurricanes at once. The noise of it broke windows in Rome and flattened farmhouses in Sardinia and knocked over ten mosques deep in the Tuni­sian Sahara. But the real blast was aimed eastward across the water, over toward Greece, and it went across that peninsula like a scythe, taking out half the treetops from Agios Nikolaus on the Ionian side to Athens over on the Aegean, and kept on going clear into Turkey.</p>
   <p>It was a little signal, so to speak. I was heading that way myself, with some very ancient scores to settle.</p>
   <p>I started down the mountainside, fast. The lava surging all around my thudding feet meant nothing to me.</p>
   <p>Call me Typhoeus. Call me Titan.</p>
   <p>I suppose I might have attracted a bit of attention as I made my way down those fiery slopes and past all the elegant seaside resorts that now were going crazy with hysteria over the eruption, and went striding into the sea midway between Fiumefreddo and Taormina. I am, after all, something of a monster, by your standards: four hun­dred feet high, let us say, with all those heads, dragon heads at that, and eyes that spurt flame, and thick black bristles everywhere on my body and swarms of coiling vipers sprouting from my thighs. The gods themselves have been known to turn and run at the mere sight of me. Some of them, once upon a time, fled all the way to Egypt when I yelled “Boo!”</p>
   <p>But perhaps the eruption and the associated earthquakes kept the people of eastern Sicily so very preoccupied just then that they didn’t take time to notice what sort of being it was that was walking down the side of Mount Etna and perambulating off toward the sea. Or maybe they didn’t believe their eyes. Or it could be that they simply nodded and said, “Sure. Why not?”</p>
   <p>I hit the water running and put my heads down and swam swiftly Greeceward across the cool blue sea without even bothering to come up for breath. What would have been the point? The air behind me smelled of fire and brimstone. And I was in a hurry.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Zeus, </emphasis>I thought. <emphasis>I’m coming to get you, you bastard!</emphasis></p>
   <p>As I said, I’m a Titan. It’s the family name, not a description. We Titans were the race of Elder Gods—the first drafts, so to speak, for the deities that you people would eventually worship—the ones that Zeus walloped into oblivion long before Bill Gates came down from Mount Sinai with MS-DOS. Long before Homer sang. Long before the Flood. Long before, as a matter of fact, anything that might mean anything to you.</p>
   <p>Gaea was our mother. The Earth, in other words. The mother of us all, really.</p>
   <p>In the early days of the world broad-bosomed Gaea brought forth all sorts of gods and giants and monsters. Out of her came far-seeing Uranus, the sky, and then he and Gaea created the first dozen Titans, Oceanus and Cro­nus and Rhea and that bunch.</p>
   <p>The original twelve Titans spawned a lot of others: Atlas, who now holds up the world; and tricky Prometh­eus, who taught humans how to use fire and got himself the world’s worst case of cirrhosis for his trouble, and silly scatterbrained Epimetheus, who had that thing with Pandora, and so on. There were snake-limbed giants like Porphyrion and Alcyoneus, and hundred-armed fifteen-headed beauties like Briareus and Cottus and Gyes, and other oversized folk like the three one-eyed Cyclopes, Arges of the storms and Brontes of the thunder and Steropes of the lightning, and so on. Oh, what a crowd we were!</p>
   <p>The universe was our oyster, so I’m told. It must have been good times for all and sundry. I hadn’t been born yet, in that era when Uranus was king.</p>
   <p>But very early on there was that nasty business between Uranus and his son Cronus, which ended very badly for Uranus, the bloody little deal with the sharp sickle, and Cronus became the top god for a while, until he made the mistake of letting Zeus get born. That was it, for Cronus. In this business you have to watch out for overambitious sons. Cronus tried—he swallowed each of his children as they were born, to keep them from doing to him what he had done to Uranus—but Zeus, the last-born, eluded him. Very unfortunate for Cronus.</p>
   <p>Family history. Dirty linen.</p>
   <p>As for Zeus, who as you can see showed up on the scene quite late but eventually came to be in charge of things, he’s my half-sister Rhea’s son, so I suppose you’d call him my nephew. I call him my nemesis.</p>
   <p>After Zeus had finished off Cronus he mopped up the rest of the Titans in a series of wild wars, thunderbolts ricochet­ing all over the place, the seas boiling, whole continents going up in flame. Some of us stayed neutral and some of us, I understand, actually allied themselves with him, but none of that made any difference. When all the shouting was over the whole pack of Titans were all prisoners in various disagreeable places, such as, for example, deep down under­neath Mount Etna with the forge of Hephaestus sitting on your back; and Zeus and his outfit, Hades and Poseidon and Apollo and Aphrodite and the rest, ruled the roost.</p>
   <p>I was Gaea’s final experiment in maternity, the youngest of the Titans, born very late in the war with Zeus. Her final monster, some would say, because of my unusual looks and size. Tartarus was my father: the Underworld, he is. I was born restless. Dangerous, too. My job was to avenge the family against the outrages Zeus had perpe­trated on the rest of us. I came pretty close, too.</p>
   <p>And now I was looking for my second chance.</p>
   <subtitle>* * * *</subtitle>
   <p>Greece had changed a lot since I last had seen it. Some­thing called civilization had happened in the meanwhile. Highways, gas stations, telephone poles, billboards, high-rise hotels, all those nice things.</p>
   <p>Still and all, it didn’t look so very bad. That killer blue sky with the golden blink in it, the bright sparkle of the low rolling surf, the white-walled cubes of houses climb­ing up the brown knifeblade hillsides: a handsome land, all things considered.</p>
   <p>I came ashore at the island of Zakynthos on the Peloponnesian coast. There was a pleasant waterfront town there with an old fortress on a hilltop and groves of olives and cypresses all around. The geological disturbances con­nected with my escape from my prison cell beneath Mount Etna did not appear to have done much damage here.</p>
   <p>I decided that it was probably not a great idea to let myself be seen in my actual form, considering how mon­strous I would look to mortal eyes and the complications that that would create for me. And so, as I approached the land, I acquired a human body that I found swimming a short way off shore at one of the beachfront hotels.</p>
   <p>It was a serviceable, athletic he-body, a lean, trim one, not young but full of energy, craggy-faced, a long jaw and a long sharp nose and a high forehead. I checked out his mind. Bright, sharp, observant. And packed with data, both standard and quirkily esoteric. All that stuff about Bill Gates and Homer and high-rises and telephone poles: I got that from him. And how to behave like a human being. And a whole lot more, all of which I suspected would be useful to acquire.</p>
   <p>A questing, creative mind. A good person. I liked him. I decided to use him.</p>
   <p>In half a wink I transformed myself into a simulacrum of him and went on up the beach into town, leaving him behind just as he had been, all unknowing. The duplication wouldn’t matter. Nobody was likely to care that there were two of him wandering around Greece at the same time, unless they saw both of us at the same moment, which wasn’t going to happen.</p>
   <p>I did a little further prowling behind his forehead and learned that he was a foreigner in Greece, a tourist. Married, three children, a house on a hillside in a dry country that looked a little like Greece, but was far away. Spoke a language called English, knew a smattering of other tongues. Not much Greek. That would be okay: I have my ways of communicating.</p>
   <p>To get around the countryside properly, I discovered, I was going to need land-clothing, money, and a passport. I took care of these matters. Details like those don’t pose problems for such as we.</p>
   <p>Then I went rummaging in his mind to see whether he had any information in there about the present where­abouts of Zeus.</p>
   <p>It was a very orderly mind. He had Zeus filed under “Greek Mythology.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>Mythology?</emphasis></p>
   <p>Yes. Yes! He knew about Gaea, and Uranus, and the overthrow of Uranus by Cronus. He knew about the other Titans, at any rate some of them—Prometheus, Rhea, Hy­perion, Iapetus. He knew some details about a few of the giants and miscellaneous hundred-armed monsters, and about the war between Zeus and the Titans and the Titans’ total downfall, and the takeover by the big guy and his associates, Poseidon and Apollo and Ares &amp; Company. But these were all stories to him. Fables. <emphasis>Mythology.</emphasis></p>
   <p>I confess I looked in his well-stocked mental archives for myself, Typhoeus—even a Titan has some vanity, you know—but all I found was a reference that said, “Typhon, child of Hera, is often confused with the earlier Titan Typhoeus, son of Gaea and Tartarus.”</p>
   <p>Well, yes. The names are similar; but Typhon was the bloated she-dragon that Apollo slew at Delphi, and what does that have to do with me?</p>
   <p>That was bad, very bad, to show up in this copiously furnished mind only as a correction of an erroneous refer­ence to someone else. Humiliating, you might actually say. I am not as important as Cronus or Uranus in the scheme of things, I suppose, but I did have my hour of glory, that time I went up against Zeus single-handed and came very close to defeating him. But what was even worse than such neglect, far worse, was to have the whole splendid swaggering tribe of us, from the great mother Gaea and her heavenly consort down to the merest satyr and wood-nymph, tucked away in there as so much mythology.</p>
   <p>What had happened to the world, and to its gods, while I lay writhing under Etna?</p>
   <p>Mount Olympus seemed a reasonable first place for me to go to look for some answers.</p>
   <p>I was at the absolute wrong end of Greece for that: down in the southwestern corner, whereas Olympus is far up in the northeast. All decked out in my new human body and its new human clothes, I caught a hydrofoil ferry to Patra, on the mainland, and another ferry across the Gulf of Corinth to Nafpaktos, and then, by train and bus, made my way up toward Thessaly, where Olympus is. None of these places except Olympus itself had been there last time I was in Greece, nor were there such things as trains or ferries or buses then. But I’m adaptable. I am, after all, an immortal god. A sort of a god, anyway.</p>
   <p>It was interesting, sitting among you mortals in those buses and trains. I had never paid much attention to you in the old days, any more than I would give close attention to ants or bumblebees or cockroaches. Back there in the early ages of the world, humans were few and far between, inconsequential experimental wildlife. Prometheus made you, you know, for some obscure reason of bis own: made you out of assorted dirt and slime, and breathed life into you, and turned you loose to decorate the landscape. You certainly did a job of decorating it, didn’t you?</p>
   <p>Sitting there among you in those crowded garlicky trains, breathing your exhalations and smelling your sweat, I couldn’t help admiring the persistence and zeal with which you people had covered so much of the world with your houses, your highways, your shopping malls, your amusement parks, your stadiums, your power-transmission lines, and your garbage. Especially your garbage. Very few of these things could be considered any sort of an improvement over the basic virgin terrain, but I had to give you credit for effort, anyway. Prometheus, wherever he might be now, would surely be proud of you.</p>
   <p>But where <emphasis>was </emphasis>Prometheus? Still chained up on that mountaintop, with Zeus’s eagle gnawing away on his liver?</p>
   <p>I roamed the minds of my traveling companions, but they weren’t educated people like the one I had chanced upon at that beach, and they knew zero about Prometheus. Or anybody else of my own era, for that matter, with the exception of Zeus and Apollo and Athena and a few of the other latecomer gods. Who also were mere mythology to them. Greece had different gods these days, it seemed. Someone called Christos had taken over here. Along with his father and his mother, and assorted lesser deities whose relation to the top ones was hard to figure out.</p>
   <p>Who were these new gods? Where had they come from? I was pleased by the thought that Zeus had been pushed aside by this Christos the way he had nudged old Cronus off the throne, but how had it happened? When?</p>
   <p>Would I find Christos living on top of Mount Olympus in Zeus’s old palace?</p>
   <p>Well, no. I very shortly discovered that nobody was living on top of Olympus at all.</p>
   <p>The place had lost none of its beauty, infested though modern-day Greece is by you and your kind. The enor­mous plateau on which the mountain stands is still un­spoiled; and Olympus itself rises as ever in that great soaring sweep above the wild, desolate valley, the various summits forming a spectacular natural amphitheater and the upper tiers of rock splendidly shrouded by veils of cloud.</p>
   <p>There are some roads going up, now. In the foothills I hired a car and a driver to take me through the forests of chestnut and fir to a refuge hut two thirds of the way up that is used by climbers, and there I left my driver, telling him I would go the rest of the way myself. He gave me a peculiar look, I suppose because I was wearing the wrong kind of clothing for climbing, and had no mountain­eering equipment with me.</p>
   <p>When he was gone, I shed my borrowed human form and rose up once again taller than the tallest tree in the world, and gave myself a set of gorgeous black-feathered wings as well, and went wafting up into that region of clean, pure air where Zeus had once had his throne.</p>
   <p>No throne. No Zeus.</p>
   <p>My cousins the giants Otus and Ephialtes had piled Mount Pelion on top of Mount Ossa to get up here during the war of the gods, and were flung right back down again. But I had the place to myself, unchallenged. I hovered over the jagged fleece-kissed peaks of the ultimate summit, spiraling down through the puffs of white cloud, ready for battle, but no battle was offered me.</p>
   <p>“Zeus? Zeus?”</p>
   <p>Once I had stood against him hissing terror from my grim jaws, and my eyes flaring gorgon lightning that had sent his fellow gods packing in piss-pants terror. But Zeus had withstood me, then. He blasted me with sizzling thun­derbolts and seared me to an ash, and hurled me to rack and ruin; and jammed what was left of me down under Mount Etna amid rivers of fire, with the craftsman god Hephaestus piling the tools of his workshop all over me to hold me down, and there I lay for those fifty thousand years, muttering to myself, until I had healed enough to come forth.</p>
   <p>I was forth now, all right, and looking for a rematch. Etna had vomited rivers of fire all over the fair plains of Sicily, and I was loose upon the world; but where was my adversary?</p>
   <p>“Zeus!” I cried, into the emptiness.</p>
   <p>I tried the name of Christos, too, just to see if the new god would answer. No go. He wasn’t there either. Olym­pus was as stunning as ever, but nobody godly seemed to have any use for it these days.</p>
   <p>I flew back down to the Alpine Club shelter and turned myself back into the lean-shanked American tourist with the high forehead and the long nose. I think three hikers may have seen me make the transformation, for as I started down the slope I came upon them standing slack-jawed and goggle-eyed, as motionless as though Medusa had smitten them into stone.</p>
   <p>“Hi, there, fellas,” I called to them. “Have a nice day!”</p>
   <p>They just gaped. I descended the fir-darkened mountain­side to the deep-breasted valley, and just like any hungry mortal I ate dolmades and keftedes and moussaka in a little taverna I found down there, washing it down with a few kilos of retsina. And then, not so much like any mor­tal, I walked halfway across the country to Athens. It took me a goodly number of days, resting only a few hours every night. The body I had copied was a fundamentally sturdy one, and of course I had bolstered it a little.</p>
   <p>A long walk, yes. But I was beginning to comprehend that there was no need for me to hurry, and I wanted to see the sights.</p>
   <subtitle>* * * *</subtitle>
   <p>Athens was a horror. It was the kingdom of Hades risen up to the surface of the world. Noise, congestion, all-around general grittiness, indescribable ugliness, every­thing in a miserable state of disrepair, and the air so thick with foul vapor that you could scratch your initials in it with your fingernails, if you had initials, if you had fingernails.</p>
   <p>I knew right away I wasn’t going to find any members of the old pantheon in <emphasis>this </emphasis>town. No deity in his right mind would want to spend ten minutes here. But Athens is the city of Athena, and Athena is the goddess of knowl­edge, and I thought there might be a possibility that some­where here in her city that I would be able to learn how and why and when the assorted divinities of Greece had made the transition from omnipotence to mythology, and where I might find them (or at least the one I was looking for) now.</p>
   <p>I prowled the nightmare streets. Dust and sand and ran­dom blocks of concrete everywhere, rusting metal girders standing piled for no particular reason by the side of the road, crumbling buildings. Traffic, frantic and fierce: what a mistake giving up the ox-cart had been! Cheap, tacky shops. Skinny long-legged cats hissed at me. They knew what I was. I hissed right back. We understood each other, at least.</p>
   <p>Up on the hilltop in the middle of everything, a bunch of ruined marble temples. The Acropolis, that hilltop is, the highest and holiest place in town. The temples aren’t bad, as mortal buildings go, but in terrible shape, fallen columns scattered hither and yon, caryatids eroded to blurs by the air pollution. Why are you people such dreadful custodians of your own best works?</p>
   <p>I went up there to look around, thinking I might find some lurking god or demigod in town on a visit. I stood by the best of the tumbledown temples, the one called the Parthenon, and listened to a little man with big eyeglasses who was telling a group of people who looked exactly like him how the building had looked when it was new and Athena was still in town. He spoke a language that my host body didn’t understand at all, but I made a few adjustments and comprehended. So many languages, you mortals! <emphasis>We </emphasis>all spoke the same language, and that was good enough for us; but we were only gods, I suppose.</p>
   <p>When he was through lecturing them about the Par­thenon, the tour guide said, “Now we will visit the Sanc­tuary of Zeus. This way, please.”</p>
   <p>The Sanctuary of Zeus was just back of the Parthenon, but there really wasn’t very much left of it. The tour guide did a little routine about Zeus as father of the gods, getting six facts out of every five wrong.</p>
   <p>“Let me tell you a few things about Zeus,” I wanted to say, but I didn’t. “How he used to cheat at cards, for instance. And the way he couldn’t keep his hands off young girls. Or, maybe, the way he bellowed and moaned the first time he and I fought, when I tangled him in the coils of my snakes and laid him low, and cut the tendons of his hands and feet to keep him from getting rambunc­tious, and locked him up in that cave in Cilicia.”</p>
   <p>I kept all that to myself. These people didn’t look like they’d care to hear any commentary from a stranger. Any­way, if I told that story I’d feel honor bound to go on and explain how that miserable sneak Hermes crept into the cave when I wasn’t looking and patched Zeus up—and then how, once Zeus was on his feet again, he came after me and let me have it with such a blast of lightning bolts that I was fried halfway to a crisp and wound up spending the next few epochs as a prisoner down there under Etna.</p>
   <p>A dispiriting place, the Acropolis.</p>
   <p>I went slinking down and over to the Plaka, which is the neighborhood in back of it, for some lunch. Human bodies need to be fed again and again, all day long. Swordfish grilled on skewers with onions and tomatoes; more retsina; fruit and cheese. All right. Not bad. Then to the National Museum, a two-hour walk, sweat-sticky and dusty. Where I looked at broken statues and bought a guidebook that told me about the gods whose statues these were. Not even close to the actualities, any of them. Did they seriously think that brawny guy with the beard was Poseidon? And the woman with the tin hat, Athena? And that blowhard—Zeus? Don’t make me laugh. Please. My laughter destroys whole cities.</p>
   <p>Nowhere in the whole museum were there any represen­tations of Titans. Just Zeus, Apollo, Aphrodite, Poseidon, and the rest of them, the junior varsity, the whole mob of supplanters, over and over and over. It was as if we didn’t count at all in the historical record.</p>
   <p>That hurt. I was in one hell of a sour mood when I left the museum.</p>
   <p>There was a Temple of Olympian Zeus in town, the guidebook said, somewhere back in the vicinity of the Acropolis. I kept hoping that I would find some clue to Zeus’s present place of residence at one of the sites that once had been sacred to him. A vestige, a lingering whiff of divinity.</p>
   <p>But the Temple of Olympian Zeus was nothing but an incomplete set of ruined columns, and the only whiff I picked up there was the whiff of mortality and decay. And now it was getting dark and the body I was inhabiting was hungry again. Back to the Plaka; grilled meat, wine, a sweet pudding.</p>
   <p>Afterwards, as I roamed the winding streets leading down to the newer part of the city with no special purpose in mind, a feeble voice out of a narrow alley said, in the native language of my host body, “Help! Oh, please, help!”</p>
   <p>I was not put into this world for the purpose of helping anyone. But the body I had duplicated in order to get around in modern Greece was evidently the body of a kindly and responsible person, because his reflexes took over instantly, and I found myself heading into that alley­way to see what aid I could render the person who was so piteously crying out.</p>
   <p>Deep in the shadows I saw someone—a woman, I real­ized—lying on the ground in what looked like a pool of blood. I went to her side and knelt by her, and she began to mutter something in a bleary way about being attacked and robbed.</p>
   <p>“Can you sit up?” I said, slipping my arm around her back. “It’ll be easier for me to carry you if—”</p>
   <p>Then I felt a pair of hands grasping me by the shoulders, not gently, and something hard and sharp pressing against the middle of my back, and the supposedly bloodied and battered woman I was trying to help rolled deftly out of my grasp and stepped back without any trouble at all, and a disagreeable rasping voice at my left ear said quietly, “Just give us your wristwatch and your wallet and you won’t get hurt at all.”</p>
   <p>I was puzzled for a moment. I was still far from accus­tomed to human ways, and it was often necessary to peer into my host-mind to find out what was going on.</p>
   <p>Quickly, though, I came to understand that there was such a thing as crime in your world, and that some of it was being tried on me at this very moment. The woman in the alley was bait; I was the prey; two accomplices had been lurking in the shadows.</p>
   <p>I suppose I could have given them my wristwatch and wallet without protest, and let them make their escape. What did a wristwatch mean to me? And I could create a thousand new wallets just like the one I had, which I had created also, after all. As for harm, they could do me none with their little knife. I had survived even the lightnings of Zeus. Perhaps I should have reacted with godlike indif­ference to their little attempt at mugging me.</p>
   <p>But it had been a long dreary discouraging day, and a hot one, too. The air was close and vile-smelling. Maybe I had allowed my host body to drink a little too much retsina with dinner. In any event, godlike indifference was not what I displayed just then. Mortal petulance was more like the appropriate term.</p>
   <p>“Behold me, fools,” I said.</p>
   <p>I let them see my true form.</p>
   <p>There I was before them, sky-high, mountainous, a hor­rendous gigantic figure of many heads and fiery eyes and thick black bristles and writhing viperish excrescences, a sight to make even gods quail.</p>
   <p>Of course, inasmuch as I’m taller than the tallest tree and appropriately wide, manifesting myself in such a nar­row alleyway might have posed certain operational prob­lems. But I have access to dimensions unavailable to you, and I made room for myself there with the proper interpenetrational configurations. Not that it mattered to the three muggers, because they were dead of shock the moment they saw me towering before them.</p>
   <p>I raised my foot and ground them into the pavement like noxious vermin.</p>
   <p>Then, in the twinkling of an eye, I was once more a slender, lithe middle-aged American tourist with thinning hair and a kindly smile, and there were three dark spots on the pavement of the alley, and that was that.</p>
   <p>It was, I admit, overkill.</p>
   <p>But I had had a trying day. In fact, I had had a trying fifty thousand years.</p>
   <subtitle>* * * *</subtitle>
   <p>Athens had been so hellish that it put me in mind of the authentic kingdom of Hades, and so that was my next destination, for I thought I might get some answers down there among the dead. It wasn’t much of a trip, not for me. I opened a vortex for myself and slipped downward and there right in front of me were the black poplars and willows of the Grove of Persephone, with Hades’ Gate just behind it.</p>
   <p>“Cerberus?” I called. “Here, doggy doggy doggy! Good Cerberus! Come say hello to Daddy!”</p>
   <p>Where was he, my lovely dog, my own sweet child? For I myself was the progenitor of the three-headed guard­ian of the gate of Hell, by virtue of my mating with my sister, Tartarus and Gaea’s scaly-tailed daughter Echidna. We made the Harpies too, did Echidna and I, and the Chimera, and Scylla, and also the Hydra, a whole gaudy gorgeous brood of monsters. But of all my children I was always most fond of Cerberus, for his loyalty. How I loved to see him come running toward me when I called! What pleasure I took in his serpent-bristled body, his voice like clanging bronze, his slavering jaws that dripped black venom!</p>
   <p>This day, though, I wandered dogless through the Un­derworld. There was no sign of Cerberus anywhere, no trace even of his glittering turds. Hell’s Gate stood open and the place was deserted. I saw nothing of Charon the boatman of the Styx, nor Hades and Queen Persephone, nor any members of their court, nor the spirits of the dead who should have been in residence here. An abandoned warehouse, dusty and empty. Quickly I fled toward the sunshine.</p>
   <subtitle>* * * *</subtitle>
   <p>The island of Delos was where I went next, looking for Apollo. Delos is, or was, his special island, and Apollo had always struck me as the coolest, most level-headed member of the Zeus bunch. Perhaps he had survived what­ever astounding debacle it was that had swept the Olympian gods away. And, if so, maybe he could give me a clue to Zeus’s current location.</p>
   <p>Big surprise! I went to Delos, but no Apollo.</p>
   <p>It was yet another dismal disillusioning journey through the tumbledown sadness that is Greece. This time I flew; not on handsome black-feathered wings, but on a clever machine, a metal tube called an airplane, full of travelers looking more or less like me in my present form. It rose up out of Athens in a welter of sound and fury and took up a course high above the good old wine-dark sea, speck­led with tawny archipelagoes, and in very short order came down on a small dry island to the south. This island was called Mykonos, and there I could buy myself passage in one of the boats that made outings several times a day to nearby Delos.</p>
   <p>Delos was a dry rubble-field, strewn with fragments of temples, their columns mostly broken off close to the ground. Some marble lions were still intact, lean and vigi­lant, crouching on their hind legs. They looked hungry. But there wasn’t much else to see. The place had the parched gloom of death about it, the bleak aura of extinction.</p>
   <p>I returned to Mykonos on the lunchtime boat, and found myself lodgings in a hillside hotel a short distance outside the pretty little narrow-streeted shorefront town. I ordered me some more mortal food and drank mortal drink. My borrowed body needed such things.</p>
   <p>It was on Mykonos that I met Aphrodite.</p>
   <p>Or, rather, she met me.</p>
   <p>I was sitting by myself, minding my own business, in the hotel’s outdoor bar, which was situated on a cobble-stoned patio bedecked with mosaics and hung with nets and oars and other purported fishing artifacts. I was on my third ouzo of the hour, which possibly was a bit much for the capacities of the body I was using, and I was staring down the hillside pensively at, well, what I have to call the wine-dark sea. (Greece brings out the clichés in anyone. Why should I resist?)</p>
   <p>A magnificent long-legged full-bodied blond woman came over to me and said, in a wonderfully throaty, husky voice, “New in town, sailor?”</p>
   <p>I stared at her, astounded.</p>
   <p>There was the unmistakable radiance of divinity about her. My Geiger counter of godliness was going clickity-clack, full blast. How could I have failed to pick up her emanations the moment I arrived on Mykonos? But I hadn’t, not until she was standing right next to me. She had picked up mine, though.</p>
   <p>“Who are you?” I blurted.</p>
   <p>“Won’t you ask a lady to sit down, even?”</p>
   <p>I jumped to my feet like a nervous schoolboy, hauled a deck chair scrapingly across and positioned it next to mine, and bowed her into it. Then I wigwagged for a waiter. “What do you want to drink?” I rasped. My throat was dry. Nervous schoolboy, yes, indeed.</p>
   <p>“I’ll have what you’re having.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Parakolo, </emphasis>ouzo on the rocks,” I told the waiter.</p>
   <p>She had showers of golden hair tumbling to shoulder length, and catlike yellow eyes, and full ripe lips that broke naturally into the warmest of smiles. The aroma that came from her was one of young wine and green fields at sunrise and swift-coursing streams, but also of lavender and summer heat, of night rain, of surging waves, of mid­night winds.</p>
   <p>I knew I was consorting with the enemy. I didn’t care.</p>
   <p>“Which one are you?” I said again.</p>
   <p>“Guess.”</p>
   <p>“Aphrodite would be too obvious. You’re probably Ares, or Hephaestus, or Poseidon.”</p>
   <p>She laughed, a melodic cadenza of merriment that ran right through the scale and into the infra-voluptuous. “You give me too much credit for deviousness. But I like your way of thinking. Ares in drag, really? Poseidon with a close shave? Hephaestus with a blond wig?” She leaned close. The fragrance of her took on hurricane intensity. “You were right the first time.”</p>
   <p>“Aphrodite.”</p>
   <p>“None other. I live in Los Angeles now. Taking a little holiday in the mother country. And you? You’re one of the old ones, aren’t you?”</p>
   <p>“How can you tell?”</p>
   <p>“The archaic emanation you give off. Something out of the pre-Olympian past.” She clinked the ice cubes thoughtfully in her glass, took a long pull of the ouzo, stared me straight in the eyes. “Prometheus? Tethys?” I shook my head. “Someone of that clan, though. I thought all of you old ones were done for a long time ago. But there’s definitely a Titan vibe about you. Which one, I wonder? Most likely one of the really strange ones. Thaumas? Phorcys?”</p>
   <p>“Stranger than those,” I said.</p>
   <p>She took a few more guesses. Not even close.</p>
   <p>“Typhoeus,” I told her finally.</p>
   <subtitle>* * * *</subtitle>
   <p>We walked into town for dinner. People turned to look at us in the narrow streets. At her, I mean. She was wear­ing a filmy orange sun dress with nothing under it and when you were east of her on a westbound street you got quite a show.</p>
   <p>“You really don’t think that I’m going to find Zeus?” I asked her.</p>
   <p>“Let’s say you have your work cut out for you.”</p>
   <p>“Well, so be it. I <emphasis>have </emphasis>to find him.”</p>
   <p>“Why is that?”</p>
   <p>“It’s my job,” I said. “There’s nothing personal about it. I’m the designated avenger. It’s my sole purpose in existence: to punish Zeus for his war against the children of Gaea. You know that.”</p>
   <p>“The war’s been over a long time, Typhoeus. You might as well let bygones be bygones. Anyway, it’s not as though Zeus got to enjoy his victory for long.” We were in the middle of the maze of narrow winding streets that is Mykonos Town. She pointed to a cheerful little restaurant called Catherine’s. “Let’s go in here. I ate here last night and it was pretty good.”</p>
   <p>We ordered a bottle of white wine. “I like the body you found for yourself,” she said. “Not particularly hand­some, no, but <emphasis>pleasing. </emphasis>The eyes are especially nice. Warm and trustworthy, but also keen, penetrating.”</p>
   <p>I would not be drawn away from the main theme. “What happened to the Olympians?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“Died off, most of them. One by one. Of neglect. Starvation.”</p>
   <p>“Immortal gods don’t die.”</p>
   <p>“Some do, some don’t. You know that. Didn’t Argus of the Hundred Eyes kill your very own Echidna? And did she come back to life?”</p>
   <p>“But the major gods—”</p>
   <p>“Even if they don’t die, they can be forgotten, and the effect’s pretty much the same. While you were locked up under Etna, new gods came in. There wasn’t even a battle. They just moved in, and we had to move along. We disap­peared entirely.”</p>
   <p>“So I’ve noticed.”</p>
   <p>“Yes. Totally out of business. You’ve seen the shape our temples are in? Have you seen anybody putting out burnt offerings to us? No, no, it’s all over for us, the worship, the sacrifices. Has been for a long time. We went into exile, the whole kit and kaboodle of us, scattered across the world. I’m sure a lot of us simply died, despite that theoretical immortality of ours. Some hung on, I sup­pose. But it’s a thousand years since the last time I saw any of them.”</p>
   <p>“Which ones did you see then?”</p>
   <p>“Apollo—he was getting gray and paunchy. And I caught sight of Hermes, once—I think it was Hermes— slow and short-winded, and limping like Hephaestus.”</p>
   <p>“And Zeus?” I asked. “You never ran into him any­where, after you all left Olympus?”</p>
   <p>“No. Never even once.”</p>
   <p>I pondered that. “So how did <emphasis>you </emphasis>manage to stay so healthy?”</p>
   <p>“I’m Aphrodite. The life-force. Beauty. Passion. Those things don’t go out of fashion for long. I’ve done all right for myself, over the years.”</p>
   <p>“Ah. Yes. Obviously you have.”</p>
   <p>The waitress fluttered around us. I was boiling with questions to ask Aphrodite, but it was time to order, and that was what we did. The usual Greek things, stuffed grape leaves, grilled fish, overcooked vegetables. Another bottle of wine. My head was pulsating. The restaurant was small, crowded, a whirlpool of noise. The nearness of Aphrodite was overwhelming. I felt dizzy. It was a surprisingly pleasant sensation.</p>
   <p>I said, after a time, “I’m convinced that Zeus is still around somewhere. I’m going to find him and this time I’m going to whip his ass and put <emphasis>him </emphasis>under Mount Etna.”</p>
   <p>“It’s amazing how much like a small boy an immortal being can be. Even one as huge and frightful as you.”</p>
   <p>My face turned hot. I said nothing.</p>
   <p>“Forget Zeus,” she urged. “Forget Typhoeus, too. Stay human. Eat, drink, be merry.” Her eyes were glistening. I felt as if I were falling forward, tumbling into the sweet chasm between her breasts. “We could take a trip to­gether. I’d teach you how to enjoy yourself. How to enjoy me, too. Tell me; have you ever been in love?”</p>
   <p>“Echidna and I—”</p>
   <p>“Echidna! Yes! You and she got together and made a bunch of hideous monsters like yourselves, with too many heads and drooling fangs. I don’t mean Echidna. This is Earth, here and now. I’m a woman now and you’re a man.”</p>
   <p>“But Zeus—”</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Zeus,” </emphasis>she said scornfully. She made the name of the Lord of Olympus sound like an obscenity.</p>
   <p>We finished eating and I paid the check and we went outside into the mild, breezy Mykonos night, strolling for fifteen or twenty minutes, winding up finally in a dark, deserted part of the town, a warehouse district down by the water, where the street was no more than five feet wide and empty shuttered buildings with whitewashed walls bordered us on both sides.</p>
   <p>She turned to me there and pulled me abruptly up against her. Her eyes were bright with mischief. Her lips sought mine. With a little hissing sound she nudged me backward until I was leaning against a wall, and she was pressing me tight, and currents of energy that could have fired a continent were passing between us. I think there could have been no one, not man nor god, who would not have wanted to trade places with me just then.</p>
   <p>“Quickly! The hotel!” she whispered.</p>
   <p>“The hotel, yes.”</p>
   <p>We didn’t bother to walk. That would have taken too long. In a flash we vanished ourselves from that incompre­hensible tangle of mazelike streets and reappeared in her room at our hotel, and from then to dawn she and I gener­ated such a delirium of erotic force that the entire island shook and shivered with the glorious Sturm und Drang of it. We heaved and thrust and moaned and groaned, and rivers of sweat ran from our bodies and our hearts pounded and thundered and our eyes rolled in our heads from giddy exhaustion, for we allowed ourselves the luxury of mortal limitations for the sake of the mortal joy of transcending those limitations. But because we <emphasis>weren’t </emphasis>mortal we also had the option of renewing our strength whenever we had depleted it, and we exercised that option many a time before rosy-fingered dawn came tiptoeing up over the high-palisaded eastern walls.</p>
   <p>Naked, invisible to prying eyes, Aphrodite and I walked then hand in hand along the morning-shimmering strand of the fish-swarming sea, and she murmured to me of the places we would go, the things we would experience.</p>
   <p>“The Taj Mahal,” she said. “And the summer palace at Udaipur. Persepolis and Isfahan in springtime. Baalbek. Paris, of course. Carcassonne. Iguacu Falls, and the Blue Mosque, and the Fountains of the Blue Nile. We’ll make love in the Villa of Tiberius on Capri—and between the paws of the Sphinx—and in the snow on top of Mount Everest—’’</p>
   <p>“Yes,” I said. “Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.”</p>
   <p>And what I was thinking was, <emphasis>Zeus. Zeus. Zeus. Zeus.</emphasis></p>
   <subtitle>* * * *</subtitle>
   <p>And so we travel about the world together, Aphrodite and I, seeing the things in it that are beautiful, and there are many of those; and so she distracts me from my true task. For the time being. It is very pleasant, traveling with Aphrodite; and so I permit myself to be distracted this way.</p>
   <p>But I have not forgotten my purpose. And this is my warning to the world.</p>
   <p>I am a restless being, a mighty thrusting force. I was created that way. My adversary doesn’t seem currently to be around. But Zeus is here somewhere. I know he is. He wears a mask. He disguises himself as a mortal, either because it amuses him to do so, or because he has no choice, for there is something in the world of which he is afraid, something from which he must hide himself, some god greater even than Zeus, as Zeus was greater than Cro­nus and Cronus was greater than Uranus.</p>
   <p>But I will find him. And when I do, I will drop this body and take on my own form again. I will stand moun­tain-high, and you will see my hundred heads, and my fires will flash and range. And Zeus and I will enter into combat once more, and this time I will surely win.</p>
   <p>It will happen.</p>
   <p>I promise you that, O small ones. I warn you. It will happen.</p>
   <p>You will tremble then. I’m sorry for that. The mind that came with this body I wear now has taught me something about compassion; and so I regret the destruction I will inevitably visit upon you, because it cannot be avoided, when Zeus and I enter into our struggle. You have my sincerest apologies, in advance. Protect yourselves as best you can. But for me there can be no turning away from my task.</p>
   <p>Zeus? This is Typhoeus the Titan who calls you!</p>
   <p>Zeus, where are you?</p>

   <p><strong>AFTERWORD</strong></p>
   <p>He wrote a lot of magnificent, unforgettable science fic­tion, sure, but so did my late and still lamented friends X, Y, and Z, and yet their deaths didn’t have the kick-in-the-belly impact of Roger’s. For one thing, it came so soon. Fifty-eight isn’t an appropriate age for dying—especially when you’re as youthful and vigorous and full of life and creative energy as Roger still was. But I lament him also because he was such a sweet and completely lovable man.</p>
   <p>I knew him almost thirty years, and I had hoped to know him thirty years more, and now that is not to be. In all those three decades I never heard him utter an unkind word about anyone. (Nor did I ever hear anybody utter an unkind word about <emphasis>him.) </emphasis>He was a man of great patience, high good humor, and warm goodwill, as I learned when the inordinately punctual Robert Silverberg showed up an hour late for dinner with him two times running, for a different silly reason each time. In all senses of the word he was a joyous man to know.</p>
   <p>So I’m going to miss the author of “A Rose for Ecclesiastes” and “... And Call Me Conrad” and all the rest of those wonderful stories, sure. We’ll never know now what marvels of inventiveness were about to emerge from his fertile mind. But most of all I’ll miss my friend Roger. If you live long enough, you’re going to outlive a lot of your friends, and you come to expect that after a time, although you don’t ever quite get used to the frequency and inevitability of the losses. This one, though, is a partic­ularly hard one to accept.</p>
