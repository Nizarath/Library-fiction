    <p>CHAPTER I</p>

   <p>“Ready, Bill?” asked Harl Swanson. Bill Kressman nodded.</p>
   <p>“Then kiss 1935 good-bye!” cried the giant Swede, and swung over the lever.</p>
   <p>The machine quivered violently, then hung motionless in pitch blackness. In the snap of a finger the bright sunlight was blotted out and a total darkness, a darkness painted with the devil’s brush, rushed in upon the two men.</p>
   <p>Electric lights glowed above the instrument boards, but their illumination was feeble against the utter blackness which crowded in upon the quartz windows of the machine.</p>
   <p>The sudden change astounded Bill. He had been prepared for something, for some sort of change, but nothing like this. He half started out of his seat, then settled back.</p>
   <p>Harl observed him and grinned.</p>
   <p>“Scared,” he jested.</p>
   <p>“Hell, no,” said Bill.</p>
   <p>“You’re traveling in time, my lad,” said Harl. “You aren’t in space any more. You are in a time stream. Space is curved about you. Can’t travel in time when you’re still in space, for space binds time to a measured pace, only so fast, no faster. Curve space about you, though, and you can travel in time. And when you’re out of space there’s absolutely no light, therefore, utter darkness. Likewise no gravity, nor any of the universal phenomena.”</p>
   <p>Bill nodded. They had worked it all out before, many, many times. Double wall construction of a strength to withstand the vacuum into which the flier would be plunged at the move of the lever which would snatch it out of space into the time stream. An insulation to guard against the absolute zero that would rule where there could be no heat. Gravity grids at their feet so that they would still be able to orient themselves when flung into that space where there was no gravity. An elaborate heating system to keep the motors warm, to prevent the freezing of gasoline, oil and water. Powerful atmosphere generators to supply air to the passengers and the motors.</p>
   <p>It had represented years of work, ten years of it, and a wealth that mounted into seven figures. Time after time they had blundered, again and again they had failed. The discoveries they had made would have rocked the world, would have revolutionized industry, but they had breathed no word of it. They had thought of only one thing, time travel.</p>
   <p>To travel into the future, to delve into the past, to conquer time, to this the two young scientists had dedicated all their labors, and at last success lay beneath their hands.</p>
   <p>It was in 1933 they had at last achieved their goal. The intervening months were spent in experiments and the building of the combination flier-time machine.</p>
   <p>Miniature fliers were launched, with the miniature time machines set automatically. They had buzzed about the laboratory, to suddenly disappear. Perhaps at this very instant they were whirling madly through un-guessed ages.</p>
   <p>They managed to construct a small time machine, set to travel a month into the future. In a month’s time, almost to the second, it had materialized on the laboratory floor where it had dropped at the end of its flight through time. That settled it! The feasibility of time travel was proved beyond all doubt.</p>
   <p>Now Harl Swanson and Bill Kressman were out in the time stream. There had been a gasp of amazement from the crowd, on the street, which had seen the giant tri-motored plane suddenly disappear into thin air.</p>
   <p>Harl crouched over the instrument board. His straining ears could distinguish the wheezy mutterings of the three motors as, despite the elaborate precautions taken to safeguard them, the inexorable fingers of absolute zero clutched at their throbbing metal.</p>
   <p>This was a dangerous way, but the only safe way. Had they remained on the surface to plunge into the time stream they might have halted to find themselves and their machine buried by shifting earth; they might have found a great building over them, they might have found a canal covering them. Here in the air they were safe from all that might occur beneath them in the passing centuries through which they sped at an almost unbelievable pace. They were being fairly hurled through time.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, the great machine would serve as a means of travel in that future day when they would roll out of the time stream back into space again. Perhaps it might serve as a means of escape, for there was no foreknowledge to tell them what they might expect a few thousand years in the future.</p>
   <p>The motors wheezed more and more. They were operating on a closed throttle. At full speed they might dash the propellers to bits.</p>
   <p>However, they must be warmed up. Otherwise they would simply die. It would be stark tragedy to roll out into space with three dead engines. It would mean a crash which neither of them could hope to survive.</p>
   <p>“Give her the gun, Bill,” said Harl in a tense voice.</p>
   <p>Bill pushed the accelerator slowly. The motors protested, sputtered, and then burst into a roar. Here, in the machine, because of the artificial air, sound could be heard. Out in the time stream there could be no sound.</p>
   <p>Harl listened anxiously, hoping fiercely that the propellers would stand.</p>
   <p>Bill cut the acceleration and the motors, once more barely turning over, ran more smoothly.</p>
   <p>Harl glanced at his wrist watch. Despite the fact they were in time, where actual time could not be measured by clocks, the little watch still ticked off the time-space seconds and minutes.</p>
   <p>They had been out eight minutes. Seven minutes more and they must roll out of time into space.</p>
   <p>Fifteen minutes was all that the tortured motors could stand of this intense cold and vacuum.</p>
   <p>He glanced at the time dial. It read 2816. They had traveled 2816 years into the future. They should be well over 5000 when the fifteen minutes were at an end.</p>
   <p>Bill touched his arm.</p>
   <p>“You’re sure we’re still over Denver?”</p>
   <p>Harl chuckled.</p>
   <p>“If we aren’t, we may find ourselves billions of miles out in space. It’s a chance we have to take. According to all our experiments we should be in exactly the same position we were when we snapped into the time stream. We are occupying a hole in space. It should remain the same.”</p>
   <p>Their lungs began to ache. Either the atmosphere generators were failing or the air leakage out into the vacuum was greater than they had expected. Undeniably the air was becoming thinner. The motors still ran steadily, however. It must be a leakage from the cabin of the ship.</p>
   <p>“How long?” bellowed Bill.</p>
   <p>Harl glanced at his watch.</p>
   <p>“Twelve minutes,” he reported.</p>
   <p>The time dial read 4224.</p>
   <p>“Three minutes,” replied Bill, “I guess we can stand it. The motors are running all right. It’s getting colder, though, and the air’s pretty thin.”</p>
   <p>“Leakage,” said Harl gruffly.</p>
   <p>The minutes dragged.</p>
   <p>Bill tried to think. Here they hung, hypothetically, over the city of Denver. Less than a quarter of an hour ago, they were in the year 1935, now they were passing over years at a lightning-like speed — a speed of over 350 years in each space-minute. They must now be in about the year 6450.</p>
   <p>He glanced at his hands. They were blue. It was intensely cold in the cabin. Their heat was leaking — leaking swiftly. It was hard to breathe. The air was rare — too rare for safety. Suppose they became unconscious. Then they would freeze — would drive endlessly through time. Frozen corpses, riding through the aeons. The earth beneath them would dissolve in space. New worlds might form, new galaxies be born as they whirled on in the time stream. The time needle would reach the pin, bend back upon itself and slip past the pin, to slam against the side of the dial, where it would still struggle to record the flight of the years.</p>
   <p>He chafed his hands and glanced at the time dial. It read 5516.</p>
   <p>“A quarter of a minute,” snapped Harl, his teeth chattering, his right hand on the lever, his wrist watch held in front of him.</p>
   <p>Bill placed his hands on the wheel.</p>
   <p>“All right!” shouted Harl.</p>
   <p>He jerked the lever.</p>
   <p>They hung in the sky.</p>
   <p>Harl uttered a cry of astonishment.</p>
   <p>It was twilight. Beneath them were the ruins of a vast city. To the east lapped a sea, stretching to a murky horizon. The sea coast was a desert of heaped sand.</p>
   <p>The motors, warming to their task, bellowed a mighty challenge.</p>
   <p>“Where are we?” cried Harl.</p>
   <p>Bill shook his head.</p>
   <p>“It’s not Denver,” said Harl.</p>
   <p>“Doesn’t look much like it,” agreed Bill, his teeth still chattering.</p>
   <p>He circled, warming the motors.</p>
   <p>There was no sign of humanity below them.</p>
   <p>The motors blasted a throaty defiance to the desert sands and under Bill’s hand, the machine came down in a long swoop, headed for a level stretch of sand near one of the largest of the white stone ruins.</p>
   <p>It hit the ground, bounced high in a cloud of sand, struck and bounced again, then rolled to a stop.</p>
   <p>Bill cut the motors.</p>
   <p>“We’re here,” he said.</p>
   <p>Harl stretched his legs wearily.</p>
   <p>Bill glanced at the time dial. It read 5626.</p>
   <p>“This is the year 7561,” he said slowly, thoughtfully.</p>
   <p>“Got your gun?” asked Harl.</p>
   <p>Bill’s hand went to his side, felt the reassuring touch of the.45 in its holster.</p>
   <p>“I have it,” he said.</p>
   <p>“All right, let’s get out.”</p>
   <p>Harl opened the door and they stepped out. The sand glittered under their boots.</p>
   <p>Harl turned the key in the door lock and locked the ring to his belt.</p>
   <p>“Wouldn’t do to lose the keys,” he said.</p>
   <p>A chill wind was blowing over the desert, moaning among the ruins, carrying with it a freight of fine, hard granules. Even in their heavy clothing, the time explorers shivered.</p>
   <p>Harl grasped Bill by the arm, pointing to the east.</p>
   <p>There hung a huge dull red ball.</p>
   <p>Bill’s jaw fell.</p>
   <p>“The sun,” he said.</p>
   <p>“Yes, the sun,” said Harl.</p>
   <p>They stared at one another in the half-light.</p>
   <p>“Then this isn’t the year 7561,” stammered Bill.</p>
   <p>“No, more likely the year 750,000, perhaps even more than that.”</p>
   <p>“The time dial was wrong then.”</p>
   <p>“It was wrong. Badly wrong. We were traveling through time a thousand times faster than we thought.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>They were silent, studying the landscape about them. They saw only ruins which towered hundreds of feet above the sands. They were ruins of noble proportions, many of them still bearing the hint of a marvelous architecture of which the twentieth century would have been incapable. The stone was pure white, gleaming beautifully in the twilight which the feeble rays of the great brick-red sun could not expel.</p>
   <p>“The time dial,” said Bill, thoughtfully, “was registering thousands of years instead of years.”</p>
   <p>Harl nodded cheerlessly.</p>
   <p>“Maybe,” he said. “For all we know it may have been registering tens of thousands of years.”</p>
   <p>A creature, somewhat like a dog, dull gray in color, with tail hanging low, was silhouetted for a moment on a sand dune and then disappeared.</p>
   <p>“These are the ruins of Denver,” said Harl. “That sea we saw must cover the whole of eastern North America. Probably only the Rocky Mountains remain unsubmerged and they are a desert. Yes, we must have covered at least 750,000 years, perhaps seven million.”</p>
   <p>“What about the human race? Do you think there are any people left?” asked Bill.</p>
   <p>“Possibly. Man is a hardy animal. It takes a lot to kill him and he could adapt himself to almost any kind of environment. This change, you must remember, came slowly.”</p>
   <p>Bill turned about and his cry rang in Harl’s ear. Harl whirled.</p>
   <p>Running toward them, leaping over the sands, came a motley horde of men. They were dressed in furs and they carried no weapons, but they charged down upon the two as if to attack.</p>
   <p>Harl yanked his .45 from its holster. His great hand closed around the weapon and his finger found the trigger. It gave him a sense of power, this burly six-shooter.</p>
   <p>The men, their furs flying behind them, were only a hundred yards away. Now they yelled, blood-curdling, vicious whoops which left no doubt that they were enemies.</p>
   <p>No weapons. Harl grinned. They’d give ‘em hell and plenty of it. There were about fifty in the mob. Big odds, but not too great.</p>
   <p>“We might as well let them have it,” he said to Bill. The two guns roared. There was disorder in the running ranks, but the mob still forged ahead, leaving two of its members prone on the ground. Again the .45’s barked, spurting a stream of fire.</p>
   <p>Men staggered, screaming, to collapse. The rest hurdled them, raced on. It seemed nothing could stop them. They were less than fifty feet away.</p>
   <p>The guns were empty. Swiftly the two plucked cartridges from their belts and reloaded.</p>
   <p>Before they could fire the mob was on top of them. Bill thrust his gun into the face of a running foeman and fired. He had to sidestep quickly to prevent the fellow tumbling on top of him. A knotted fist connected with his head and he slipped to his knees. From that position he drilled two more of the milling enemies before they piled on top of him.</p>
   <p>Through the turmoil he heard the roar of Harl’s gun.</p>
   <p>He felt the grip of many hands, felt bodies pressing close about him. He fought blindly and desperately.</p>
   <p>He fought with hands, with feet, with suddenly bared teeth. He felt bodies wilt under his blows, felt blood upon his hands. The sand, kicked up by many feet, got into his nostrils and eyes, half strangling, half blinding him.</p>
   <p>Only a few feet away Harl fought, fought in the same manner as his companion. With their weapons knocked from their hands they resorted to the tactics of their ancient forebears.</p>
   <p>It seemed minutes that they battled with their attackers, but it could not have been more than seconds before the sheer weight of numbers subdued them, wound thongs tightly about their hands and feet and left them, trussed like two fowls ready for the grid.</p>
   <p>“Hurt, Bill?” called Harl.</p>
   <p>“No,” replied Bill. “Just mussed up a bit.”</p>
   <p>“Me, too,” said Harl.</p>
   <p>They lay on their backs and stared up at the sky. Their captors moved away and massed about the plane.</p>
   <p>A loud banging came to the ears of the two. Evidently the others were trying to force an entrance into the machine.</p>
   <p>“Let them bang,” said Harl. “They can’t break anything.”</p>
   <p>“Except a propeller,” replied Bill.</p>
   <p>After more banging, the men returned and untying the bonds on the feet of the captives, hoisted them up.</p>
   <p>For the first time they had an opportunity to study their captors. They were tall men, well proportioned, clean of limb, with the stamp of well-being about them. Aside from their figures, however, they held a distinctly barbarous appearance. Their hair was roughly trimmed, as were their beards. They walked with a slouch and their feet shuffled in the sand with the gait of one who holds a purposeless existence. They were dressed in well-tanned furs, none too clean. They bore no arms and their eyes were the eyes of furtive beings, shifty, restless, as are the eyes of hunted beasts, always on the lookout for danger.</p>
   <p>“March,” said one of them, a large fellow with a protruding front tooth. The single word was English, with the pronunciation slightly different than it would have been in the twentieth century, but good, pure English.</p>
   <p>They marched, flanked on either side by their captors. The march led back over the same route as the future-men had come. They passed the dead, but no attention was paid them, their comrades passing the sprawled figures with merely a glance. Life apparently was cheap in this place.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER II</p>
    <p><emphasis>Orders of Golan-Kirt</emphasis></p>
   </title>
   <p>They passed between monstrous ruins. The men talked among themselves, but, although the tongue was English, it was so intermixed with unfamiliar words and spoken with such an accent that the two could understand very little of it.</p>
   <p>They reached what appeared to be a street. It led between rows of ruins and now other humans appeared, among them women and children. All stared at the captives and jabbered excitedly.</p>
   <p>“Where are you taking us?” Bill asked a man who walked by his side.</p>
   <p>The man ran his fingers through his beard and spat in the sand.</p>
   <p>“To the arena,” he said slowly that the twentieth century man might understand the words.</p>
   <p>“What for?” Bill also spoke slowly and concisely.</p>
   <p>“The games,” said the man, shortly, as if displeased at being questioned.</p>
   <p>“What are the games?” asked Harl.</p>
   <p>“You’ll find out soon enough. They are held at high sun today,” growled the other. The reply brought a burst of brutal laughter from the rest.</p>
   <p>“They will find out when they face the minions of Golan-Kirt,” chortled a voice.</p>
   <p>“The minions of Golan-Kirt!” exclaimed Harl.</p>
   <p>“Hold your tongue,” snarled the man with the protruding tooth, “or we will tear it from your mouth.”</p>
   <p>The two time-travelers asked no more questions.</p>
   <p>They plodded on. Although the sand beneath their feet was packed, it was heavy going and their legs ached. Fortunately the future-men did not hustle their pace, seeming to be content to take their time.</p>
   <p>A good-sized crowd of children had gathered and accompanied the procession, staring at the twentieth century men, shrieking shrill gibberish at them. A few of them, crowding too close or yelling too loudly, gained the displeasure of the guards and were slapped to one side.</p>
   <p>For fifteen minutes they toiled up a sandy slope. Now they gained the top and in a depression below them they saw the arena. It was a great building, open to the air, which had apparently escaped the general destruction visited upon the rest of the city. Here and there repairs had been made, evident by the decidedly inferior type of workmanship.</p>
   <p>The building was circular in shape, and about a half-mile in diameter. It was built of a pure white stone, like the rest of the ruined city.</p>
   <p>The two twentieth century men gasped at its size.</p>
   <p>They had little time, however, to gaze upon the building, for their captors urged them on. They walked slowly down the slope and, directed by the future-men, made their way through one of the great arching gateways and into the arena proper.</p>
   <p>On all sides rose tier upon tier of seats, designed to hold thousands of spectators. On the opposite side of the arena was a series of steel cages, set under the seats.</p>
   <p>The future-men urged them forward.</p>
   <p>“They’re going to lock us up, evidently,” said Bill.</p>
   <p>He of the protruding tooth laughed, as if enjoying a huge joke.</p>
   <p>“It will not be for long,” he said.</p>
   <p>As they approached the cages, they saw that a number of them were occupied. Men clung to the bars, peering out at the group crossing the sandy arena. Others sat listlessly, regarding their approach with little or no interest. Many of them, the twentieth century men noticed, bore the marks of prolonged incarceration.</p>
   <p>They halted before one of the cells. One of the future-men stepped to the door of the cage and unlocked it with a large key. As the door grated back on rusty hinges, the others seized the two, unbound their hands and roughly hurled them inside the prison. The door clanged to with a hollow, ringing sound and the key grated in the lock.</p>
   <p>They struggled up out of the dirt and refuse which covered the floor of the cell and squatted on their heels to watch the future-men make their way across the arena and through the archway by which they had come.</p>
   <p>“I guess we’re in for it,” said Bill.</p>
   <p>Harl produced a pack of cigarettes.</p>
   <p>“Light up,” he said gruffly.</p>
   <p>They lit up. Smoke from tobacco grown in 1935 floated out of their cell over the ruins of the city of Denver, upon which shone a dying sun.</p>
   <p>They smoked their cigarettes, crushed them in the sand. Harl rose and began a minute examination of their prison. Bill joined him. They went over it inch by inch, but it was impregnable. Except for the iron gate, it was constructed of heavy masonry. An examination of the iron gate gave no hope. Again they squatted on their heels.</p>
   <p>Harl glanced at his wrist watch.</p>
   <p>“Six hours since we landed,” he said, “and from the appearance of the shadows, it’s still morning. The sun was well up in the sky, too, when we arrived.”</p>
   <p>“The days are longer than those back in 1935,” explained Bill. “The earth turns slower. The days here may be twenty-four hours or longer.”</p>
   <p>“Listen,” hissed Harl.</p>
   <p>To their ears came the sound of voices. They listened intently. Mingled with the voices was the harsh grating of steel. The voices seemed to come from their right. They grew in volume.</p>
   <p>“If we only had our guns,” moaned Harl.</p>
   <p>The clamor of voices was close and seemed to be almost beside them.</p>
   <p>“It’s the other prisoners,” gasped Bill. “They must be feeding them or something.”</p>
   <p>His surmise was correct.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Before their cell appeared an old man. He was stooped and a long white beard hung over his skinny chest. His long hair curled majestically over his shoulders. In one hand he carried a jug of about a gallon capacity and a huge loaf of bread.</p>
   <p>But it was neither the bread nor the jug which caught the attention of Harl and Bill. In his loincloth, beside a massive ring of keys, were thrust their two.45’s.</p>
   <p>He set down the jug and the loaf and fumbled with the keys. Selecting one he unlocked and slid back a panel near the bottom of the great door. Carefully he set the jug and the loaf inside the cell.</p>
   <p>The two men inside exchanged a glance. The same thought had occurred to each. When the old man came near the door, it would be a simple matter to grasp him. With the guns there was a chance of blazing a way to the ship.</p>
   <p>The oldster, however, was pulling the weapons from his loincloth.</p>
   <p>Their breath held in wonder, the time-travelers saw him lay them beside the jug and the loaf.</p>
   <p>“The command of Golan-Kirt,” he muttered in explanation. “He has arrived to witness the games. He commanded that the weapons be returned. They will make the games more interesting.”</p>
   <p>“More interesting,” chuckled Harl, rocking slowly on the balls of his feet.</p>
   <p>These future-men, who seemed to possess absolutely no weapons, apparently did not appreciate the deadliness of the.45’s.</p>
   <p>“Golan-Kirt?” questioned Bill, speaking softly.</p>
   <p>The old man seemed to see them for the first time.</p>
   <p>“Yes,” he said. “Know you not of Golan-Kirt? He-Who-Came-Out-of-the-Cosmos?”</p>
   <p>“No,” said Bill.</p>
   <p>“Then truly can I believe what has come to my ears of you?” said the old man.</p>
   <p>“What have you heard?”</p>
   <p>“That you came out of time,” replied the oldster, “in a great machine.”</p>
   <p>“That is true,” said Harl. “We came out of the twentieth century.”</p>
   <p>The old man slowly shook his head.</p>
   <p>“I know naught of the twentieth century.”</p>
   <p>“How could you?” asked Harl. “It must have ended close to a million years ago.”</p>
   <p>The other shook his head again.</p>
   <p>“Years?” he asked. “What are years?”</p>
   <p>Harl drew in his breath sharply.</p>
   <p>“A year,” he explained, “is a measurement of time.”</p>
   <p>“Time cannot be measured,” replied the old man dogmatically.</p>
   <p>“Back in the twentieth century we measured it,” said Harl.</p>
   <p>“Any man who thinks he can measure time is a fool,” the future-man was uncompromising.</p>
   <p>Harl held out his hand, palm down, and pointed to his wrist watch.</p>
   <p>“That measures time,” he asserted.</p>
   <p>The old man scarcely glanced at it.</p>
   <p>“That,” he said, “is a foolish mechanism and has nothing to do with time.”</p>
   <p>Bill laid a warning hand on his friend’s arm.</p>
   <p>“A year,” he explained slowly, “is our term for one revolution of the earth about the sun.”</p>
   <p>“So that is what it means,” said the old man. “Why didn’t you say so at first? The movement of the earth, however, has no association with time. Time is purely relative.”</p>
   <p>“We came from a time when the world was much different,” said Bill. “Can you give us any idea of the number of revolutions the earth has made since then?”</p>
   <p>“How can I?” asked the old man, “when we speak in terms that neither understands? I can only tell you that since Golan-Kirt came out of the Cosmos the earth has circled the sun over five million times.”</p>
   <p>Five million times! Five million years! Five million years since some event had happened, an event which may not have occurred for many other millions of years after the twentieth century. At least five million years in the future; there was no telling how much more!</p>
   <p>Their instrument had been wrong. How wrong they could not remotely have guessed until this moment!</p>
   <p>The twentieth century. It had a remote sound, an unreal significance. In this age, with the sun a brick red ball and the city of Denver a mass of ruins, the twentieth century was a forgotten second in the great march of time, it was as remote as the age when man emerged from the beast.</p>
   <p>“Has the sun always been as it is?” asked Harl.</p>
   <p>The old man shook his head.</p>
   <p>“Our wise ones tell us that one time the sun was so hot it hurt one’s eyes. They also tell us it is cooling, that in the future it will give no light or heat at all.”</p>
   <p>The oldster shrugged his shoulders.</p>
   <p>“Of course, before that happens, all men will be dead.”</p>
   <p>The old man pulled the little panel shut and locked it. He turned to go.</p>
   <p>“Wait,” cried Harl.</p>
   <p>The old one faced them.</p>
   <p>“What do you want?” he asked, mumbling half-angrily in his beard.</p>
   <p>“Sit down, friend,” said Harl. “We would like to talk further.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>The other hesitated, half wheeling to go, then turned back.</p>
   <p>“We came from a time when the sun hurt one’s eyes. We have seen Denver as a great and proud city. We have seen this land when the grass grew upon it and rain fell and there were broad plains where the sea now lies,” said Harl.</p>
   <p>The oldster sank to the sand in front of their cage. His eyes were lighted with a wild enthusiasm and his two skinny hands clutched the iron bars.</p>
   <p>“You have looked upon the world when it was young,” he cried. “You have seen green grass and felt rain. It seldom rains here.”</p>
   <p>“We have seen all you mention,” Harl assured him. “But we would ask why we have been treated as foes. We came as friends, hoping to meet friends, but ready for war.”</p>
   <p>“Aye, ready for war,” said the old man in trembling tones, his eyes on the guns. “Those are noble weapons. They tell me you strewed the sands with the dead ere you were taken.”</p>
   <p>“But why were we not treated as friends?” insisted Harl.</p>
   <p>“There are no friends here,” cackled the old man. “Not since Golan-Kirt came. All are at one another’s throats.”</p>
   <p>“Who is this Golan-Kirt?”</p>
   <p>“Golan-Kirt came out of the Cosmos to rule over the world,” said the old man, as if intoning a chant. “He is neither Man nor Beast. There is no good in him. He hates and hates. He is pure Evil. For after all, there is no friendliness or goodness in the universe. We have no proof that the Cosmos is benevolent. Long ago our ancestors believed in love. This was a fallacy. Evil is greater than good.”</p>
   <p>“Tell me,” asked Bill, moving closer to the bars, “have you ever seen Golan-Kirt?”</p>
   <p>“Aye, I have.”</p>
   <p>“Tell us of him,” urged Bill.</p>
   <p>“I cannot,” there was stark terror in the old man’s eyes. “I cannot!”</p>
   <p>He huddled closer to the cage and his voice dropped to an uncanny whisper.</p>
   <p>“Men out of time, I will tell you something. He is hated, because he teaches hate. We obey him because we must. He holds our minds in the hollow of his hand. He rules by suggestion only. He is not immortal. He fears death — he is afraid — there is a way, if only one with the courage might be found—”</p>
   <p>The old man’s face blanched and a look of horror crept into his eyes. His muscles tensed and his clawlike hands clutched madly at the bars. He slumped against the gate and gasped for breath.</p>
   <p>Faintly his whisper came, low and halting.</p>
   <p>“Golan-Kirt — your weapons — believe nothing — close your mind to all suggestion—”</p>
   <p>He stopped, gasping for breath.</p>
   <p>“I have fought—” he continued, haltingly, with an effort. “I have won—. I have told you—. He has — killed me — he will not kill you — now that you — know—.”</p>
   <p>The old man was on the verge of death. Wide-eyed, the two saw him ward it off, gain a precious second.</p>
   <p>“Your weapons — will lull him — he’s easy to kill — by one who does not — believe in him — he is a—.”</p>
   <p>The whisper pinched out and the old man slid slowly to the sands in front of the cage.</p>
   <p>The two stared at the crumpled form of humanity.</p>
   <p>“Killed by suggestion,” gasped Harl.</p>
   <p>Bill nodded.</p>
   <p>“He was a brave man,” he said.</p>
   <p>Harl regarded the corpse intently. His eyes lighted on the key ring and kneeling, he reached out and drew the body of the future-man close. His fingers closed on the ring and ripped it from the loincloth.</p>
   <p>“We’re going home,” he said.</p>
   <p>“And on the way out we’ll bump off the big shot,” added Bill.</p>
   <p>He lifted the guns from the floor and clicked fresh cartridges into the chambers. Harl rattled the keys. He tried several before he found the correct one. The lock screeched and the gate swung open protestingly.</p>
   <p>With quick steps they passed out of the cell. For a moment they halted in silent tribute before the body of the old man. With helmets doffed the twentieth century men stood beside the shriveled form of a man who was a hero, a man who had flung his hatred in the face of some terrible entity that taught hate to the people of the world. Scanty as was the information which he had given, it set the two on their guard, gave them an inkling of what to expect.</p>
   <p>As they turned about they involuntarily started. Filing into the amphitheater, rapidly filling the seats, were crowds of future-men. A subdued roar, the voice of the assembling people, came to their ears.</p>
   <p>The populace was assembling for the games.</p>
   <p>“This may complicate matters,” said Bill.</p>
   <p>“I don’t think so,” replied Harl. “It’s Golan-Kirt we must deal with. We would have had to in any case. These men do not count. As I understand it he exercises an absolute control over them. The removal of that control may change the habits and psychology of the future-men.”</p>
   <p>“The only thing we can do is fight Golan-Kirt and then act accordingly,” said Bill.</p>
   <p>“The man who captured us spoke of his minions,” Harl said thoughtfully.</p>
   <p>“He may be able to produce hallucinations,” Bill hazarded. “He may be able to make one believe something exists when it really doesn’t. In that case, the people would naturally believe them to be creatures which came at his beck and call.”</p>
   <p>“But the old man knew,” objected Harl. “He knew that it was all mere suggestion. If all the people knew this the rule of Golan-Kirt would end abruptly. They would no longer believe in his omnipotence. Without this belief, suggestion, by which he rules, would be impossible.”</p>
   <p>“The old man,” asserted Bill, “gained his knowledge in some mysterious manner and paid for its divulgence with his life. Still the old fellow didn’t know all of it. He believed this entity came out of the Cosmos.”</p>
   <p>Harl shook his head, thoughtfully.</p>
   <p>“It may have come out of the Cosmos. Remember, we are at least five million years in the future. I expect to find some great intelligence. It is physical, for the old man claimed to have seen it, and that should make our job easier.”</p>
   <p>“The old man said he was not immortal,” commented Bill. “Therefore, he is vulnerable and our guns may do the work. Another thing — we are not to believe a single thing we feel, hear, or see. He seems to rule wholly by suggestion. He will try to kill us by suggestion, just as he killed the old fellow.”</p>
   <p>Harl nodded.</p>
   <p>“It’s a matter of will power,” he said. “A matter of brain and bluff. Apparently the will power of these people has degenerated and Golan-Kirt finds it easy to control their minds. They are born, live, and die under his influence. It has almost become hereditary to accept his power. We have the advantage of coming out of an age when men were obliged to use their brains. Perhaps the human mind degenerated because, as science increased the ease of life, there was little need to use it. Some fine minds may still remain, but apparently they are few. We are doubters, schemers, bluffers. Golan-Kirt will find us tougher than these future-men.”</p>

    <p>CHAPTER III</p>
    <p><emphasis>The Struggle of the Ages</emphasis></p>
   </title>
   <p>Bill produced cigarettes and the two lighted up. Slowly they walked across the vast arena, guns hanging in their right hands. People were filing into the place and the tiers were filling.</p>
   <p>A roar came out of the tiers of seats before them. They recognized it. It was the cry of the gathering crowd, the cry for blood, the expression of a desire to see battle.</p>
   <p>Harl grinned.</p>
   <p>“Regular football crowd,” he commented.</p>
   <p>More and more poured into the arena, but it was apparent that the inhabitants of the ruined city could fill only a very small section of the thousands upon thousands of seats.</p>
   <p>The two seemed lost in the mighty space. Above them, almost at the zenith, hung the vast red sun. They seemed to move in a twilight-filled desert rimmed in by enormous white cliffs.</p>
   <p>“Denver must have been a large city at the time this place was built,” commented Bill. “Think of the number of people it would hold. Wonder what it was used for?”</p>
   <p>“Probably we’ll never know,” said Harl.</p>
   <p>They had gained the approximate center of the arena.</p>
   <p>Harl halted.</p>
   <p>“Do you know,” he said, “I’ve been thinking. It seems to me we must have a fairly good chance against Golan-Kirt. For the last fifteen minutes every thought of ours has been in open defiance of him, but he has not attempted our annihilation. Although it is possible he may only be biding his time. I am beginning to believe he can’t read our minds as he could the mind of the old man. He killed him the moment he uttered a word of treason.”</p>
   <p>Bill nodded.</p>
   <p>As if in answer to what Harl had said, a great weight seemed to press in upon them. Bill felt a deadly illness creeping over him. His knees sagged and his brain whirled. Spots danced before his eyes and a horrible pain gripped his stomach.</p>
   <p>He took a step forward and stumbled. A hand clutched his shoulder and fiercely shook him. The shake momentarily cleared his brain. Through the clearing mist which seemed to hang before his eyes, he saw the face of his friend, a face white and lined.</p>
   <p>The lips in the face moved.</p>
   <p>“Buck up, old man. There’s nothing wrong with you. You’re feeling fine.”</p>
   <p>Something seemed to snap inside his head. This was suggestion — the suggestion of Golan-Kirt. He had to fight it. That was it — fight it.</p>
   <p>He planted his feet firmly in the sand, straightened his shoulders with an effort, and smiled.</p>
   <p>“Hell, no,” he said, “there’s nothing wrong with me, I’m feeling fine.”</p>
   <p>Harl slapped him on the back.</p>
   <p>“That’s the spirit,” he roared. “It almost floored me for a minute. We’ve got to fight it, boy. We’ve got to fight it.”</p>
   <p>Bill laughed, harshly. His head was clear now and he could feel the strength flowing back into his body. They had won the first round!</p>
   <p>“But where is this Golan-Kirt?” he burst out.</p>
   <p>“Invisible,” snarled Harl, “but I have a theory that he can’t put in his best licks in such a state. We’ll force him to show himself and then we’ll give him the works.”</p>
   <p>The frenzied roar of the crowd came to their ears. Those on the bleachers had seen and appreciated the little drama out in the middle of the arena. They were crying for more.</p>
   <p>Suddenly a spiteful rattle broke out behind the two.</p>
   <p>They started. That sound was familiar. It was the rat-a-tat of a machine gun. With no ceremony they fell flat, pressing their bodies close against the ground, seeking to burrow into the sand.</p>
   <p>Little puffs of sand spurted up all about them. Bill felt a searing pain in his arm. One of the bullets had found him. This was the end. There was no obstruction to shield them in this vast level expanse from the gun that chuckled and chattered at their rear. Another searing pain caught him in the leg. Another hit.</p>
   <p>Then he laughed — a wild laugh. There was no machine gun, no bullets. It was all suggestion. A trick to make them believe they were being killed — a trick, which, if carried far enough, would kill them.</p>
   <p>He struggled to his knees, hauling Harl up beside him. His leg and arm still pained, but he paid them no attention. There was nothing wrong with them, he told himself fiercely, absolutely nothing wrong.</p>
   <p>“It’s suggestion again,” he shouted at Harl. “There isn’t any machine gun.”</p>
   <p>Harl nodded. They regained their feet and turned. There, only a couple of hundred yards away, a khaki-clad figure crouched behind a gun that chattered wickedly, a red flame licking the muzzle.</p>
   <p>“That isn’t a machine gun,” said Bill, speaking slowly.</p>
   <p>“Of course, it’s not a machine gun,” Harl spoke as if by rote.</p>
   <p>They walked slowly toward the flaming gun. Although bullets apparently whistled all about them, none struck them. The pain in Bill’s arm and leg no longer existed.</p>
   <p>Suddenly the gun disappeared, and with it the khaki-clad figure. One moment they were there, the next they were not.</p>
   <p>“I thought it would do just that,” said Bill.</p>
   <p>“The old boy is still going strong, though,” replied Harl. “Here is some more of his suggestion.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Harl pointed to one of the arching gateways. Through it marched file upon file of soldiers, clad in khaki, metal helmets on their heads, guns across their shoulders. An officer uttered a sharp command and the troops began to deploy over the field.</p>
   <p>A shrill blast of a bugle drew the attention of the two time-travelers from the soldiers and through another gateway they beheld the advance of what appeared to be a cohort of Roman legionnaires. Shields flashed dully in the sun and the rattle of arms could be distinctly heard.</p>
   <p>“Do you know what I believe?” asked Harl.</p>
   <p>“What is it?”</p>
   <p>“Golan-Kirt cannot suggest anything new to us. The machine guns and the soldiers and legionnaires are all things of which we have former knowledge.”</p>
   <p>“How is it,” asked Bill, “that we see these things when we know they do not exist?”</p>
   <p>“I do not know,” replied Harl, “there are a lot of funny things about this business that I can’t understand.”</p>
   <p>“Anyhow, he is giving the crowd a good show,” observed Bill.</p>
   <p>The bleachers were in an uproar. To the ears of the two came the shrill screaming of women, the loud roars of the men. The populace was thoroughly enjoying itself.</p>
   <p>A lion, large and ferocious, growling fiercely, leaped past the two men. A thunder of hoof-beats announced the arrival of more of the brain creatures.</p>
   <p>“It’s about time for us to do something,” said Harl.</p>
   <p>He lifted his.45 high in the air and fired. A hush fell.</p>
   <p>“Golan-Kirt, attention!” roared Harl, in a voice that could be heard in every part of the arena. “We challenge you to personal combat. We have no fear of your creatures. They cannot harm us. You are the one we wish to fight.”</p>
   <p>An awed silence fell over the crowd. It was the first time their god had ever been openly challenged. They waited for the two lone figures out in the arena to be stricken in a heap.</p>
   <p>They were not stricken, however.</p>
   <p>Again Harl’s voice rang out.</p>
   <p>“Come out of hiding, you fat-bellied toad!” he thundered. “Come and fight if you have the guts, you dirty, yellow coward!”</p>
   <p>The crowd may not have gathered the exact meaning of the words, but the full insult of them was plain. A threatening murmur rolled out from the bleachers, and there was a sudden surging of the crowd. Men leaped over the low wall in front of the seats and raced across the arena.</p>
   <p>Then a sonorous voice, deep and strong, rolled out.</p>
   <p>“Stop,” it said. “I, Golan-Kirt, will deal with these men.”</p>
   <p>Harl noticed that the soldiers and the lion had disappeared. The arena was empty except for him and his comrade and the score of future-men who had halted in their tracks at the voice which had come out of nothingness.</p>
   <p>They waited, tensed. Harl wriggled his feet into a firmer position. He slipped a cartridge in the gun to take the place of the one which had been fired. Bill mopped his brow with the sleeve of his coat.</p>
   <p>“It’s going to be brains now,” Harl told his friend.</p>
   <p>Bill grinned.</p>
   <p>“Two mediocre intelligences against a great one,” he joked.</p>
   <p>“Look, Bill!” shouted Harl.</p>
   <p>Directly in front and slightly above the level of their heads a field of light had formed, a small ball of brightness in the murky atmosphere. Slowly it grew. Vibrations set in.</p>
   <p>The two watched, fascinated. The vibrations quickened until the whole field was quivering. As the vibrations increased the light faded and a monstrosity began to take form. Only vaguely could it be seen at first. Then it became clearer and clearer, began to take definite form.</p>
   <p>Hanging in the air, suspended without visible means of support, was a gigantic brain, approximately two feet in diameter. A naked brain, with the convolutions exposed. It was a ghastly thing.</p>
   <p>The horror of it was heightened by the two tiny, pig-like, lidless, close-set eyes and a curving beak which hung directly below the frontal portion of the brain, resting in what was apparently an atrophied face.</p>
   <p>The two were aghast, but with a tremendous effort they kept close hold on their self-control.</p>
   <p>“Greetings, Golan-Kirt,” drawled Harl, sarcasm putting an edge to the words.</p>
   <p>As he spoke, his arm swung up and under the pressure of his finger, the hammer of the gun slowly moved backward. But before the muzzle could be brought in line with the great brain, the arm stopped and Harl stood like a frozen man, held rigid by the frightful power which poured forth from Golan-Kirt.</p>
   <p>Bill’s arm flashed up and his.45 broke the silence with a sullen roar. However, even as he fired, his arm was flung aside as if by a mighty blow and the speeding bullet missed the huge brain by the mere fraction of an inch.</p>
   <p>“Presumptuous fools,” roared a voice, which, however, seemed not a voice, for there was no sound, merely the sense of hearing. The two, standing rigidly, as if at attention, realized that it was telepathy: that the brain before them was sending out powerful emanations.</p>
   <p>“Presumptuous fools, you would fight me, Golan-Kirt? I, who have a hundred-fold the mental power of your combined brains? I, who hold the knowledge of all time?”</p>
   <p>“We would fight you,” snarled Harl. “We are going to fight you. We know you for what you are. You are not out of the Cosmos. You are a laboratory specimen. Unknown ages ago you were developed under artificial conditions. You are not immortal. You fear our weapons. A bullet in that dirty brain of yours will finish you.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>“Who are you to judge,” came the thought-wave, “you, with your tiny, twentieth century brain? You have come unbidden into my time, you have defied me. I shall destroy you. I, who came out of the Cosmos aeons ago to rule over the portion of the Universe I chose as my own, do not fear you or your ridiculous weapons.”</p>
   <p>“Yet you foiled us when we would have used our weapons on you. If I could reach you I would not need my weapon. I could tear you apart, destroy you with the strength of my two hands.”</p>
   <p>“Say on,” rumbled the thought-waves. “Say what you believe me to be, and when you are done I shall obliterate you. You shall be dust floating in the air, ashes on the sands.”</p>
   <p>There was an unveiled tone of mockery in the brain emanations.</p>
   <p>Harl raised his voice, almost shouting. It was a deliberate act, done in hopes the future-men would hear, that they might realize not too late the true nature of the tyrant Golan-Kirt. They did hear and their mouths gaped as they listened.</p>
   <p>“You once were a man,” Harl roared, “a great scientist. You studied the brain, specialized in it. At last you discovered a great secret, which gave you the power of developing the brain to an unheard-of degree. Sure of your technique, and realizing the power you might enjoy, you transformed yourself into a brain creature. You are a fraud and an impostor. You have mis-ruled these people for millions of years. You are not out of the Cosmos, — you are a man, or what once was a man. You are an atrocity, an abomination—”</p>
   <p>The thought emanations which flowed from out the brain trembled, as if with rage.</p>
   <p>“You lie. I am out of the Cosmos. I am immortal. I shall kill you— kill you.”</p>
   <p>Suddenly Bill laughed, a resounding guffaw. It was an escape from the terrible tension, but as he laughed a ludicrous angle presented itself — the twentieth century travelers millions of years ahead of their time wrangling with a cheat pawning himself off as a god on a people who would not be born until long after he was dead.</p>
   <p>He felt the horrible power of Golan-Kirt centering upon him. Perspiration streamed down his face and his body trembled. He felt his strength leaving him.</p>
   <p>He stopped laughing. As he did so, he seemed to be struck, as if by a blow. He staggered. Then sudden realization flashed through him. Laughter! Laughter, that was it. Laughter and ridicule! That would turn the trick.</p>
   <p>“Laugh, you fool, laugh,” he screamed at Harl.</p>
   <p>Uncomprehendingly, Harl obeyed.</p>
   <p>The two rocked with laughter. They whooped and roared.</p>
   <p>Hardly knowing what he did, almost involuntarily, Bill screeched horrible things at the great brain, reviled it, taunted it, called it almost unspeakable names.</p>
   <p>Harl began to understand. It was all a great game that Bill was playing. A supreme egoism such as was lodged in the brain pitted against them could not bear ridicule, would lose its grip before a storm of jeers. For uncounted centuries, through some miraculous power, it had lived and in all that time it had been accorded only the highest honor. Derision was something with which it was unacquainted, a terrible weapon suddenly loosed upon it.</p>
   <p>Harl joined with Bill and hurled gibes at Golan-Kirt. It was a high carnival of mockery. They were not conscious of their words. Their brains responded to the emergency and their tongues formed sentences of un-guessed taunts.</p>
   <p>Between sentences they laughed, howling with satanic glee.</p>
   <p>Through all their laughter they felt the power of the brain. They felt its anger mount at their taunting. Their bodies were racked with pain, they wanted to fall on the sands and writhe in agony, but they continued to laugh, to shout taunts.</p>
   <p>It seemed an eternity that they fought with Golan-Kirt, all the time shrieking with laughter, while they suffered fine-edged torture from the tops of their heads to the soles of their feet. Still they dare not stop their laughter, dare not cease their hideous derision, poking fun at the huge intelligence which opposed them. That was their one weapon. Without it the engulfing waves of suggestion which poured with relentless fury upon them would have snapped asunder every nerve in their bodies.</p>
   <p>They sensed the raging of the great brain. It was literally crazed with anger. They were “getting its goat!” They were ridiculing the very life out of it.</p>
   <p>Unconsciously they allowed the pitch of their laughter to lower. From sheer exhaustion they lapsed into silence.</p>
   <p>Suddenly they felt the terrible force of the brain renewed, as it drew upon some mysterious reserve strength. It struck them like a blow, doubling them over, clouding their eyes, dulling their minds, racking every nerve and joint.</p>
   <p>Hot irons seemed to sear them, hundreds of needles seemed thrust in their flesh, sharp knives seemed to slash their bodies. They reeled blindly, gropingly, mouthing curses, crying out in pain.</p>
   <p>Through the red haze of torture came a whisper, a soft, enchanting whisper, a whisper beckoning to them, showing them a way of escape.</p>
   <p>“Turn your weapons on yourselves. End all of this torture. Death is painless.”</p>
   <p>The whisper fluttered through their brains. That was the way out! Why endure this seemingly endless torture? Death was painless. The muzzle against one’s head, a pressure on the trigger, oblivion.</p>
   <p>Bill placed his gun against his temple. His finger contracted against the trigger. He laughed. This was a joke. A rare joke. Robbing Golan-Kirt by his own hand.</p>
   <p>Another voice burst through his laughter. It was Harl.</p>
   <p>“You fool! It’s Golan-Kirt! It’s Golan-Kirt, you fool!”</p>
   <p>He saw his friend staggering toward him, saw his face pinched with pain, saw the moving of the livid lips as they shouted the warning.</p>
   <p>Bill’s hand dropped to his side. Even as he continued that insane laughter, he felt chagrin steal over him. The hideous brain had played its trump card and had failed, but it had almost finished him. Had it not been for Harl he would have been stretched on the sand, a suicide, his head blown to bits.</p>
   <p>Then suddenly they felt the power of the brain slipping, felt its strength falter and ebb. They had beaten it!</p>
   <p>They sensed the gigantic struggle going on in that great brain, the struggle to regain the grip it had lost.</p>
   <p>For years on end it had lived without struggle, without question that it was the ruler of the earth. They sensed the futile anger and the devastating fear which revolved in the convolutions of Golan-Kirt.</p>
   <p>But he was beaten, beaten at last by men from out of a forgotten age. He had met defeat at the hands of ridicule, something he had never known, a thing he had not suspected.</p>
   <p>His strength ebbed steadily. The twentieth century men felt his dread power lift from them, sensed the despair which surged through him.</p>
   <p>They stopped their laughter, their sides sore, their throats hoarse. Then they heard. The arena resounded with laughter. The crowd was laughing. The horrible uproar beat like a tumult upon them. The future-men were roaring, bent over, stamping their feet, throwing back their heads, screaming to the murky skies. They were laughing at Golan-Kirt, screaming insults at him, hooting him. It was the end of his rule.</p>
   <p>For generations the future-men had hated him with the very hate he had taught them. They had hated and feared. Now they feared no longer and hate rode unchained.</p>
   <p>From a god he had fallen to the estate of a ridiculous fraud. He was a thing of pity, an uncloaked clown, simply a naked, defenseless brain that had bluffed its way through centuries of kingship.</p>
   <p>Through bleared eyes the twentieth century men saw the great brain, writhing now under the scorn of its erstwhile subjects, being laughed powerless. No longer did it hold control over these creatures of a dying world. Its close-set eyes glowed fiercely, its beak clicked angrily. It was tired, too tired to regain its rule. It was the end of Golan-Kirt!</p>
   <p>The revolvers of the time-travelers came up almost simultaneously. This time the sights lined on the brain. There was no power to ward off the danger.</p>
   <p>The guns roared rapidly, spitting hateful fire. At the impact of the bullets the brain turned over in the air, blood spurted from it, great gashes appeared in it. With a thump it struck the ground, quivered and lay still.</p>
   <p>The time-travelers, their eyes closing from sheer weariness, their knees suddenly weak, slumped to the sand, the .45’s still smoking.</p>
   <p>Over the arena floated the full-toned roar of the future-men.</p>
   <p>“Hail to the Deliverers! Golan-Kirt is dead! His rule is ended! Hail to the saviors of the race!”</p>

    <p><emphasis>Epilogue</emphasis></p>
   </title>
   <p>“It is impossible to reverse time. You cannot travel back to your own age. I have no idea of what will occur if you attempt it, but I do know it is impossible. We of this age knew travel into the future was possible, but we lacked the technique to build a machine to try it. Under the rule of Golan-Kirt there was no material progress, only a steady degeneration. We know that it is impossible to reverse time. We, as a people, beg you not to attempt it.”</p>
   <p>Old Agnar Nohl, his white beard streaming in the wind, his hair flying, spoke seriously. There was a troubled frown on his face.</p>
   <p>“We love you,” he went on, “you freed us of the tyranny of the brain which ruled over us for uncounted time. We need you. Stay with us, help us rebuild this land, help us construct machines, give us some of the marvelous knowledge which we, as a race, have lost. We can give you much in return, for we have not forgotten all the science we knew before the coming of Golan-Kirt.”</p>
   <p>Harl shook his head.</p>
   <p>“We must at least try to go back,” he said.</p>
   <p>The two twentieth century men stood beside the plane. Before them was a solid mass of humanity, a silent humanity in the shadow of the silent ruins of the city of Denver, the future-men who had come to bid the time-travelers a regretful farewell.</p>
   <p>A chill wind howled over the desert, carrying its freight of sand. The furs of the future-men fluttered in the gale as it played a solemn dirge between the ruined walls of humbled buildings.</p>
   <p>“If there was a chance of your success, we would speed you on your way,” said old Agnar, “but we are reluctant to let you go to what may be your death. We are selfish enough to wish to hold you for ourselves, but we love you enough to let you go. You taught us hate was wrong, you removed the hate that ruled us. We wish only the best for you.</p>
   <p>“It is impossible to go back in time. Why not remain? We need you badly. Our land grows less and less food every year. We must discover how to make synthetic food or we shall starve. This is only one of our problems. There are many others. You cannot go back. Stay and help us!”</p>
   <p>Again Harl shook his head.</p>
   <p>“No, we must try it. We may fail, but we must try it at least. If we succeed we shall return and bring with us books of knowledge and tools to work with.”</p>
   <p>Agnar combed his beard with skinny fingers.</p>
   <p>“You’ll fail,” he said.</p>
   <p>“But if we don’t we will return,” said Bill.</p>
   <p>“Yes, if you don’t,” replied the old man.</p>
   <p>“We are going now,” said Bill. “We thank you for your thoughtfulness. We must at least try. We are sorry to leave you. Please believe that.”</p>
   <p>“I do believe it,” cried the old man and he seized their hands in a farewell clasp.</p>
   <p>Harl opened the door of the plane and Bill clambered in.</p>
   <p>At the door Harl stood with upraised hand.</p>
   <p>“Good-bye,” he said. “Some day we will return.”</p>
   <p>The crowd burst into a roar of farewell. Harl climbed into the plane and closed the door.</p>
   <p>The motors bellowed, droning out the shouting of the future-men and the great machine charged down the sand. With a rush it took the air. Three times Bill circled the ruined city in a last mute good-bye to the men who watched silently and sorrowfully below.</p>
   <p>Then Harl threw the lever. Again the utter darkness, the feeling of hanging in nothingness.</p>
   <p>The motors, barely turning, muttered at the change. A minute passed, two minutes.</p>
   <p>“Who says we can’t travel back in time!” Harl shouted triumphantly. He pointed to the needle. It was slowly creeping back across the face of the dial.</p>
   <p>“Maybe the old man was wrong after—”</p>
   <p>Bill never finished the sentence.</p>
   <p>“Roll her out,” he screamed at Harl, “roll her out. One of our engines is going dead!”</p>
   <p>Harl snatched at the lever, jerked frantically at it. The faulty motor choked and coughed, sputtered, then broke into a steady drone.</p>
   <p>The two men in the cabin regarded one another with blanched faces. They knew they had escaped a possible crash — and death — by bare seconds.</p>
   <p>Again they hung in the air. Again they saw the brick-red sun, the desert, and the sea. Below them loomed the ruins of Denver.</p>
   <p>“We couldn’t have gone far back in time,” said Harl. “It looks the same as ever.”</p>
   <p>They circled the ruins.</p>
   <p>“We had better land out in the desert to fix up the engine,” suggested Harl. “Remember we have traveled back in time and Golan-Kirt still rules over the land. We don’t want to have to kill him a second time. We might not be able to do it.”</p>
   <p>The plane was flying low and he nosed it up. Again the faulty engine sputtered and missed.</p>
   <p>“She’s going dead this time for certain,” yelled Bill. “We’ll have to chance it, Harl. We have to land and chance getting away again.”</p>
   <p>Harl nodded grimly.</p>
   <p>Before them lay the broad expanse of the arena. It was either that or crash.</p>
   <p>As Bill nosed the plane down the missing motor sputtered for the last time, went dead.</p>
   <p>They flashed over the white walls of the amphitheater and down into the arena. The plane struck the sand, raced across it, slowed to a stop.</p>
   <p>Harl opened the door.</p>
   <p>“Our only chance is to fix it up in a hurry and get out of here,” he shouted at Bill. “We don’t want to meet that damn brain again.”</p>
   <p>He stopped short.</p>
   <p>“Bill,” he spoke scarcely above a whisper, “am I seeing things?”</p>
   <p>Before him, set on the sands of the arena, only a few yards from the plane, was a statue of heroic size, a statue of himself and Bill.</p>
   <p>Even from where he stood he could read the inscription, carved in the white stone base of the statue in characters which closely resembled written English.</p>
   <p>Slowly, haltingly, he read it aloud, stumbling over an occasional queer character.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Two men, Harl Swanson, and Bill Kressman, came out of time to kill Golan-Kirt and to free the race.”</emphasis></p>
   <p>Below it he saw other characters.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“They may return.”</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Bill,” he sobbed, “we haven’t traveled back in time. We have traveled further into the future. Look at that stone — eroded, ready to crumble to pieces. That statue has stood there for thousands of years!”</p>
   <p>Bill slumped back into his seat, his face ashen, his eyes staring.</p>
   <p>“The old man was right,” he screamed. “He was right. We’ll never see the twentieth century again.”</p>
   <p>He leaned over toward the time machine.</p>
   <p>His face twitched.</p>
   <p>“Those instruments,” he shrieked, “those damned instruments! They were wrong. They lied, they lied!”</p>
   <p>With his bare fists he beat at them, smashing them, unaware that the glass cut deep gashes and his hands were smeared with blood.</p>
   <p>Silence weighed down over the plain. There was absolutely no sound.</p>
   <p>Bill broke the silence.</p>
   <p>“The future-men,” he cried, “where are the future-men?”</p>
   <p>He answered his own question.</p>
   <p>“They are all dead,” he screamed, “all dead. They are starved — starved because they couldn’t manufacture synthetic food. We are alone! Alone at the end of the world!”</p>
   <p>Harl stood in the door of the plane.</p>
   <p>Over the rim of the amphitheater the huge red sun hung in a sky devoid of clouds. A slight wind stirred the sand at the base of the crumbling statue.</p>
