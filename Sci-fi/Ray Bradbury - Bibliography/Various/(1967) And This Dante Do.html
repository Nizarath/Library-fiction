<p><em><font size="5">W</font>hen science fiction is mentioned, to the non-addict, nine times out of ten the response will be something like, &quot;You mean the kind of stuff Ray Bradbury writes.&quot; Yet the kind of stuff the un-repining Mr. Bradbury now writes includes motion pictures, plays, articles, poetry&mdash;and scarcely enough science fiction stories. But he has done a science fiction poem that it is a pleasure to present here, all about the great Dante and his Marvelous Invention. A wickedly satisfying poem.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>The truth is this:</p>

<p>That long ago in times</p>

<p>Before the birth of Ligh,</p>

<p>Old Dante Alighieri prowled this way</p>

<p>On continent unknown to mad Columbus;</p>

<p>Made landfall here by sneaking, sly Machine,</p>

<p>Invention of his candle-flickered soul</p>

<p>Which, wafted upon storms,</p>

<p>Brought him in harmful mission down.</p>

<p>So, landed upon wilderness of dust</p>

<p>Where buffalos stamped forth</p>

<p>A panic of immense heartbeat,</p>

<p>Dante scanned round and stamped <em>his</em> foot,</p>

<p>And hoofed the trembling flints</p>

<p>And named a Ring of Hell.</p>

<p>With parchment clenched in tremorous fist,  </p>

<p>He inked out battlements of grime  </p>

<p>And arcs of grinding coggeries which, struck,  </p>

<p>Snowed down a dreadful cereal of rust  </p>

<p>Long years before such iron soots were dreamt </p>

<p>Or made, or flown,</p>

<p>Long long before such avenues of steel in sky were sought.  </p>

<p>So, in a guise like Piranesi lost amidst-among </p>

<p>His terrible proud Prisons,</p>

<p>The Poet sketched a vaster, higher, darker Pent-up Place  </p>

<p>A living demon-clouded sulphur-spread of Deep.  </p>

<p>From tenement to tenement of clapboard dinge </p>

<p>He rinsed a sky with coal-sack burning,  </p>

<p>Hung clouds with charcoal flags  </p>

<p>Of nightgowns flapping like strange bats  </p>

<p>Shocked down from melancholy steam-purged locomotive caves.  </p>

<p>Then through it all put scream of metal flesh,  </p>

<p>Great dinosaur machines charged forth by night,  </p>

<p>All stomaching of insucked souls </p>

<p>Pent up in windowed cells. </p>

<p>Delivered into concrete river-shallow streets, </p>

<p>Men fled themselves from spindrift shade </p>

<p>Of blown black chimney sifts and blinds of smoking ghosts. </p>

<p>And on the brows of all pale citizens therein </p>

<p>Stamped looks of purest terror, </p>

<p>Club-foot panic and despair, </p>

<p>A rank, a raveling dismay that spread in floods </p>

<p>To drain off in a lake long since gone sour </p>

<p>With discharged outpouring of slime.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So drawn, so put to parchment, so laid down</p>

<p>In raw detail, this Ring of Hell (No mind what Number!)</p>

<p>Was Dante's greatest Inventory counting-up</p>

<p>Of Souls in dread Purgation.</p>

<p>He stood a moment longer in the dust.</p>

<p>He let the frightened drumpound heart of buffalo tread</p>

<p>Please to excite his blood.</p>

<p>Then, desecration-proud, happy at the great Black Toy</p>

<p>He'd printed, builded, wound, and set to run</p>

<p>In fouled self circlings,</p>

<p>Old Dante hoisted up his heels,</p>

<p>Left low the continental lake-shore cloven-stamped,</p>

<p>And hied him home to Florence and his bed,</p>

<p>And laid him down still dreaming with a smile,</p>

<p>And in his sleep spoke centuries before its birth</p>

<p>The Name of this Abyss, the Pit, the Ring of Hell</p>

<p>He had machinery-made:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>CHICAGO!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then slept, </p>

<p>And forgot his child.</p>
