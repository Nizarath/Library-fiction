He growled when his wife finally arrived after much too     long a shower and sat across from him wearing a spider-woven Spanish mantilla and a     phosphorescent breath, like the breath of a twilight forest, sighing from her mouth.</p><p>He bent close to examine her chin, her cheeks, and her eyes.</p><p>‘No, it’s not there.’</p><p>‘What’s not there?’ she asked.</p><p>The look, he thought, of remembered and pleasant exertion.</p><p>She in turn bent forward, searching his face.</p><p>He leaned back in his chair and at last got the courage to say, ‘A strange     thing happened this afternoon.’</p><p>His wife took a sip of wine and replied, ‘Strange, I was going to say     somewhat the same thing.’</p><p>‘You first, then,’ he said.</p><p>‘No, go ahead. Tell me the strange     thing.’</p><p>‘Well,’ he said. ‘I was driving along a country road outside town when a car     passed, going the other way. There was a woman in it who looked very much like you. In the seat     beside her, wearing an extravagantly rich white suit, his hair whipping in the wind and looking     terribly and pleasantly tired, was the billionaire tennis-playing magnate Charles William     Bishop. It was all over in a second and the car was gone. After all, we were traveling forty     miles an hour.’</p><p>‘Eighty,’ said his wife. ‘Two cars passing each other in opposite directions     at forty miles an hour, the aggregate is eighty.’</p><p>‘Oh yes,’ he agreed. ‘Well, wasn’t that strange?’</p><p>‘Indeed,’ said his wife. ‘Now let me tell you my strangeness. I was driving     in a car this afternoon on a country road and a car passed at an accumulated eighty miles an     hour and I thought I saw a man in it who looked very much like you. In the seat beside him was     that beautiful heiress from Spain, Carlotta de Vega Montenegro. It was all over in a second and     I was stunned and drove on. Two strange occurrences, yes?’</p><p>‘Have some more wine,’ he said quietly. He filled her glass much too full and     they sat for a long while studying each other’s face and drinking the wine.</p><p>They listened to the soft sound of the dovelike tennis balls being struck and     tossed through the twilight air; there seemed to be a lot of     people out on the courts, enjoying themselves.</p><p>He cleared his throat and at last picked up a knife and began to run its edge     along the tablecloth between them.</p><p>‘I think,’ he said, ‘this is the way we solve our two strange problems.’</p><p>With his knife he scored a long rectangle in the cloth and cut across it so     that it resembled a metaphorical tennis court on the table.</p><empty-line></empty-line><p>Trimble and his wife looked across the net at the figures of Charles William     Bishop and Carlotta de Vega Montenegro walking away, shaking their heads, their shoulders     slumped in the noonday sun.</p><p>His wife lifted a towel to touch his cheek and he lifted one to touch     hers.</p><p>‘Well done!’ he said.</p><p>‘Bull’s-eye!’ she said.</p><p>And they looked into each other’s face to find a look of tired contentment     from recent amiable exertions.</p></body></FictionBook>
