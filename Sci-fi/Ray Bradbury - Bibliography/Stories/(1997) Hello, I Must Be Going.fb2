Steve Ralphs cried.</p><p>"Why do you sound like that?" Henry Grossbock said. "What have I done? Why am I dressed like this? Where am I going?"</p><p>"Come in, come in, someone might see you!"</p><p>"Why does it matter if someone<emphasis>sees</emphasis>me?"</p><p>"Come in, for God's sake, don't stand there arguing."</p><p>"All right, I'll come in, I have things to talk about anyway. Stand aside. There. I'm in."</p><p>Steve Ralphs backed off across the room and waved to a chair. "Sit."</p><p>"I don't feel welcome." Henry sat. "You have any strong liquor around this place?"</p><p>"I was just thinking that." Steve Ralphs jumped, ran into the kitchen, and a minute later returned with a tray, a bottle of whiskey, two glasses, and some ice. His hands were trembling as he poured the liquor.</p><p>"You look shaky," said Henry Grossbock. "What's wrong?"</p><p>"Don't you know, can't you<emphasis>guess</emphasis>? Here."</p><p>Henry took the glass. "You sure poured me a lot."</p><p>"You're going to need it. Drink."</p><p>They drank and Henry examined his coat front and his sleeves.</p><p>"You still haven't told me where I am going," he said, "or have I been there already? I don't usually dress this way except for concerts. When I stand up there before an audience, well, one desires respect. This is very good scotch. Thanks. Well?"</p><p>He stared at Steve Ralphs with a steady and penetrating stare.</p><p>Steve Ralphs gulped half of his drink and put it down and shut his eyes. "Henry, you've already been to a far place and just come back, for God's sake. And now you'll have to return to that place."</p><p>"What place,<emphasis>what</emphasis>place, stop the riddles!"</p><p>Steve Ralphs opened his eyes and said, "How did you get here? Did you take a bus, hire a taxi, or … walk from the graveyard?"</p><p>"Bus, taxi, walk? And what's that about a graveyard?"</p><p>"Henry, drink the rest of your drink. Henry, you've been in that graveyard for years."</p><p>"Don't be silly. What would I be doing<emphasis>there</emphasis>? I never applied for any—" Henry stopped and slowly sank back in his chair. "You mean—?"</p><p>Steve Ralphs nodded. "Yes, Henry."</p><p>"Dead? And in the graveyard? Dead and in the graveyard four years? Why didn't someone<emphasis>tell</emphasis>me?"</p><p>"It's hard to tell someone who's dead that he<emphasis>is</emphasis>."</p><p>"I see, I see." Henry finished his drink and held the glass out for more. Steve Ralphs refilled.</p><p>"Dear, dear," said Henry Grossbock, slowly. "My, my. So<emphasis>that's</emphasis>why I haven't felt up to snuff lately."</p><p>"That's why, Henry. Let me catch up." Steve Ralphs poured more whiskey in his own glass and drank.</p><p>"So that's why you looked so peculiar when you opened the door just now—"</p><p>"That's why, Henry."</p><p>"Sorry. I really didn't mean—"</p><p>"Don't get up, Henry. You're here now."</p><p>"But under the circumstances—"</p><p>"It's all right. I'm under control. And even given the circumstances, you were always my best friend and it's nice, in a way, to see you again."</p><p>"Strange.<emphasis>I</emphasis>wasn't shocked to see<emphasis>you</emphasis>."</p><p>"There's a difference, Henry. I mean, well—"</p><p>"You're alive, and I'm not, eh? Yes, I can see that. Hello, I must be going."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Groucho Marx sang a song with that title."</p><p>"Oh, yeah. Sure."</p><p>"Marvelous man. Funny. Is he still around? Did he die, too?"</p><p>"I'm afraid so."</p><p>"Don't be afraid. I'm not. Don't know why. Just now." Henry Grossbock sat up straight. "To business."</p><p>"What business?"</p><p>"Told you at the front door. Important. Must tell. I am very upset."</p><p>"So was I, but this liquor does wonders. Okay, Henry, shoot."</p><p>"The thing is—" Henry Grossbock said, finishing his second drink quickly, "my wife is neglecting me."</p><p>"But Henry, it's perfectly natural—"</p><p>"Let me finish. She used to come visit constantly. Brought me flowers, put a book nearby once, cried a lot. Every day. Then every other day. Now, never. How do you explain that? Refill, please."</p><p>Steve Ralphs tipped the bottle.</p><p>"Henry, four years is a long<emphasis>time</emphasis>—"</p><p>"You can say that again. How about Eternity, there's a<emphasis>real</emphasis>vaudeville show."</p><p>"You didn't really expect to be entertained, did you?"</p><p>"Why not? Evelyn always spoiled me. She changed dresses two or three times a day because she knew I loved it. Haunted bookshops, brought me the latest, read me the oldest, picked my ties, shined my shoes, her women's-lib friends joshed her for<emphasis>that.</emphasis>Spoiled. Yes, I expected to have someone fill the time for me."</p><p>"That's not how it works, Henry."</p><p>Henry Grossbock thought and nodded, solemnly, and sipped his whiskey. "Yes, I guess you're right. But let me name the<emphasis>biggest</emphasis>problem."</p><p>"What's that?"</p><p>"She's stopped crying. She used to cry every night, every day at breakfast, twice in the afternoon, just before supper. Then, lights out, crying."</p><p>"She missed you, Henry."</p><p>"And now she doesn't?"</p><p>"Time heals all wounds, they say."</p><p>"I don't want this wound healed. I liked things just the way they were. A good cry at dawn, a half decent cry before tea, a final one at midnight. But it's over. Now I don't feel wanted or needed."</p><p>"Think about it the way you had to think about your honeymoon with Evelyn. It had to end sometime."</p><p>"Not entirely. There were stray bits of it for the rest of forty years."</p><p>"Yes, but you<emphasis>do</emphasis>see the resemblance?"</p><p>"Honeymoon ended. Life over. I certainly don't much care for the residue." A thought struck Henry Grossbock. He set his glass down, sharply. "Is there someone<emphasis>else</emphasis>?"</p><p>"Someone … "</p><p>"<emphasis>Else</emphasis>! Has she taken up with—?"</p><p>"And what if she has?"</p><p>"How<emphasis>dare</emphasis>she!"</p><p>"Four years, Henry, four years. And no, she hasn't taken up with anyone. She'll remain a widow for the rest of her life."</p><p>"That's more like it. I'm glad I came to see you first. Set me straight. So she's still single and—hold on. How come no more tears at midnight, crying at breakfast?"</p><p>"You didn't really expect that, did you?"</p><p>"But damn, I miss it. A man's got to have<emphasis>something</emphasis>!"</p><p>"Don't you have any friends over at the—" Steve Ralphs stopped, flushed, refilled his glass, refilled Henry's.</p><p>"You were going to say graveyard. Bad lot, those. Layabouts. No conversation."</p><p>"You were always a great talker, Henry."</p><p>"Yes, yes, that's so, wasn't I?<emphasis>Aren't</emphasis>I? And you were my best listener."</p><p>"Talk some more, Henry. Get it all out."</p><p>"I think I've hit the high points, the important stuff. She's stopped coming by. That's bad. She's stopped crying. That's the very worst. The lubricant that makes—what I have become—worth the long while. I wonder if I showed up, would she cry again?"</p><p>"You're<emphasis>not</emphasis>going to visit?"</p><p>"Don't think I should, eh?"</p><p>"Nasty shock. Unforgivable."</p><p>"<emphasis>Who</emphasis>wouldn't forgive me?"</p><p>"Me, Henry.<emphasis>I</emphasis>wouldn't."</p><p>"Yes, yes. Oh dear. My, my. Good advice from my best friend."</p><p>"Best, Henry." Steve Ralphs leaned forward. "You<emphasis>do</emphasis>want her to get over you, don't you?"</p><p>"No! Yes. No! God, I don't know. Yes, I guess so."</p><p>"After all she<emphasis>has</emphasis>missed you and cried every day for most of four years."</p><p>"Yes." Henry Grossbock nursed his glass. "She<emphasis>has</emphasis>put in the time. I suppose I<emphasis>should</emphasis>let her off the hook."</p><p>"It would be a kindness, Henry."</p><p>"I don't<emphasis>feel</emphasis>kind, I don't<emphasis>want</emphasis>to be kind, but hell, I'll be kind anyhow. I do love the dear girl."</p><p>"After all, Henry, she has lots of years ahead."</p><p>"True. Damn. Think of it. Men age better but die younger. Women live longer but age badly. Strange arrangement God has made, don't you agree?"</p><p>"Why don't you ask Him, now that you're there?"</p><p>"Who, God? An upstart like me? Well, well. Ummm." Henry sipped. "Why not? What's she up to? If she's not dashing about in open cars with strange men,<emphasis>what</emphasis>?"</p><p>"Dancing, Henry. Taking dance lessons. Sculpting. Painting."</p><p>"Always wanted to do that, never could. Concert schedules, cocktail parties for possible sponsors, recitals, lectures, travel. She always said<emphasis>someday</emphasis>."</p><p>"Someday is here, Henry."</p><p>"Took me by surprise, is all. Dancing, you say? Sculpting? Is she any good?"</p><p>"A fair dancer. A<emphasis>very</emphasis>fine sculptor."</p><p>"Bravo. Or is it brava? Yes. Brava. I think I'm glad for that. Yes, I<emphasis>am</emphasis>glad. Fills the time. And what do I do? Crosswords."</p><p>"Crosswords?"</p><p>"Dammit, what else is there, considering my circumstances? Fortunately, I recall every single good and bad puzzle ever printed in the<emphasis>New York Times</emphasis>or the<emphasis>Saturday Review.</emphasis>Crossword. Short nickname, three letters, for Tutankhamen. Tut! Four letters, one of the Great Lakes.<emphasis>Erie</emphasis>! Easy, that one. Fourteen letters, old Mediterranean capital. Hell. Constantinople!"</p><p>"Five letters. Word for best pal, good friend, fine husband, brilliant violinist."</p><p>"Henry?"</p><p>"Henry. You." Steve Ralphs smiled, lifted his glass, drank.</p><p>"That's my cue to grab my hat and leave. Oh, I didn't bring a hat. Well, well."</p><p>Steve Ralphs suddenly swallowed very hard.</p><p>"What's this?" said Henry, leaning forward, listening.</p><p>"A repressed sob, Henry."</p><p>"Good! That's better. Warms the old heart,<emphasis>that</emphasis>does. I don't suppose you could—"</p><p>"Suppress a few more sobs, once or twice a week for the next year?"</p><p>"I hesitate to ask—"</p><p>"I'll try, Henry." Another mysterious sound moved up Steve Ralph's throat. He hastened to lid it with whiskey. "Tell you what. I'll call Evelyn, say I'm writing a book about you, need some of your personal books, notes, golf clubs, spectacles, the lot, bring them here, and, well, once a week, anyway, look them over, feel sad. How's<emphasis>that</emphasis>sound?"</p><p>"That's the ticket, or what are friends for?" Henry</p><p>Grossbock beamed. There was color in his cheeks. He drank and stood up.</p><p>At the door, Henry turned and peered into Steve Ralph's face.</p><p>"Dear me, dear me, are those tears?"</p><p>"I think so, Henry."</p><p>"Well now, that's more like it. Not Evelyn's of course, and you're not heaving great sobs. But it'll do. Much thanks."</p><p>"Don't mention it, Henry."</p><p>"Well." Henry opened the door. "See you around."</p><p>"Not too soon, Henry."</p><p>"Eh? No, of course not. No hurry. Good-bye, friend."</p><p>"Oh, good-bye, Henry." Yet another mysterious gulp arose in the younger man's throat.</p><p>"Yes, yes." Henry smiled. "Keep that up until I'm down the hall. Well, as Groucho Marx said—"</p><p>And he was gone. The door shut.</p><p>Turning, slowly, Steve Ralphs walked to the telephone, sat down, and dialed.</p><p>After a moment the receiver on the other end clicked and a voice spoke.</p><p>Steve Ralphs wiped his eyes with the back of his hand and at last said:</p><p>"Evelyn?"</p></body></FictionBook>
