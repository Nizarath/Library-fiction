Wasn’t he an old friend of yours     from high school?’</p><p>‘Yeah,’ said Menville. ‘That was the one.     Part of the gang. My very best friend, actually. Russ Simpson.’</p><p>They stood for a while, biting into their apples, chewing quietly.</p><p>‘He must have been very special,’ Smith said. ‘You’ve come all this way. But     you didn’t bring any flowers.’</p><p>‘No, only these apples. You’ll see.’</p><p>Smith stared at the marker. ‘What was there about him that was so     special?’</p><p>Menville took another bite of his apple and said, ‘He was<emphasis>constant</emphasis>. He was there every noon, he was there on the streetcar going to     school and then back home every day. He was there at recess, he sat across from me in homeroom,     and we took a class in the short story together. It was that kind of thing. Oh, sure, on     occasion he did crazy stuff.’</p><p>‘Like what?’ said Smith.</p><p>‘Well, we had this little gang of five or six guys who met at lunchtime. We     were all different, but on the other hand, we were all sort of the same. Russ used to sort of     pick at me, you know how friends do.’</p><p>‘Pick? Like what?’</p><p>‘He liked to play a game. He’d look at all of us and say, “Someone say     ‘Granger.’” He’d look at me and say, “Say ‘Granger.’” I’d say “Granger” and Russ would shake     his head and say, “No, no. One of you others say ‘Granger.’” So one of the other guys would say     “Granger” and they would all laugh, a big reaction, because he said “Granger” just the right way. Then Russ would turn to me and say, “Now it’s your turn,     you say it.” I would say “Granger” and no one would laugh and I’d stand there, feeling left     out.</p><p>‘There was a trick to the whole thing but I was so stupid, so naive, that I     could never figure out that it was a joke, the sort of thing they played on me.</p><p>‘Then one time I was over at Russ’s house and a friend of his named Pipkin     leaned over the balcony in the living room and dropped a cat on me. Can you believe that?! The     cat landed right on my head and clawed my face. It could have put out my eyes, I thought later.     Russ thought it was a great joke. Russ was laughing and Pip was laughing, and I threw the cat     across the room. Russ was indignant. “Watch what you’re doing with the cat!” he said. “Watch     what the cat was doing with me!” I cried. That was a big joke; he told everyone. They all     laughed, except me.’</p><p>‘That’s some memory,’ said Smith.</p><p>‘He was there every day, was in school with me, my best friend. Every once in     a while, at lunchtime, he’d eat an apple and when he finished he’d say, “Apple core.” And one     of the other guys would say, “Baltimore.” Russ would then say, “Who’s your friend?” They’d     point at me and he’d throw the apple core–hard–at me. This was a routine; it happened at least     once a week for a couple of years. Apple-core Baltimore.’</p><p>‘And this was your best friend?’</p><p>‘Sure, my best friend.’</p><p>They stood there by the grave, still working at their apples. The sun was     getting hotter and there was no breeze.</p><p>‘What else?’ said Smith.</p><p>‘Oh, not much. Well, sometimes at lunchtime I’d ask the typing teacher to let     me use one of the typewriters so I could write, as I didn’t have a typewriter of my own.</p><p>‘Finally, I had a chance to buy one real cheap, so I went without lunch for a     month or so, saving my lunch money. Finally, I had enough to buy my very own typewriter so I     could write whenever I wanted.</p><p>‘One day Russ looked at me and said, “My God, do you realize what you are?” I     said, “What?” He said, “You’re a stale fruitcake, giving up your money to buy that damned     typewriter. A stale fruitcake.”</p><p>‘I often thought later that someday when I finished my great American novel,     that’s what I’d call it:<emphasis>Stale Fruitcake</emphasis>.’</p><p>Smith said, ‘Better than<emphasis>Gatsby</emphasis>, huh?’</p><p>‘<emphasis>Gatsby</emphasis>, sure. Anyway, I had the typewriter.’</p><p>They were quiet then, the only sound the last bites into their diminishing     apples.</p><p>A distant expression came over Smith’s face and he blinked and suddenly     whispered, ‘Apple-core.’</p><p>To which, quickly, Menville said, ‘Baltimore.’</p><p>Smith then said, ‘Who’s your friend?’</p><p>Menville, looking down at the marker near     his feet, eyes wide, said, ‘Granger.’</p><p>‘Granger?’ said Smith, and stared at his friend.</p><p>‘Yeah,’ said Menville. ‘Granger.’</p><p>At this Smith raised his hand and threw his apple core down on top of the     gravestone.</p><p>No sooner was this done than Menville hurled his apple core down, then     reached and took it up again and threw it a second time so that the gravestone was so littered     with shreds of the apple core that you couldn’t make out the name on the marker.</p><p>They stared at the mess.</p><p>Then Menville turned and began to walk away, threading through the     gravestones, tears streaming down his cheeks.</p><p>Smith called after him. ‘Where are you going?’</p><p>Menville, not looking back, said in a hoarse voice, ‘To get some more apples,     damn it to hell, more apples.’</p></body></FictionBook>
