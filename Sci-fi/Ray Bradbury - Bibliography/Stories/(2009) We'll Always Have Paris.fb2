But it was a strange kind of following.</p><p>I looked behind me and no one was there. I looked ahead about forty yards and     saw a young man in a summer suit.</p><p>At first I didn’t realize what he was doing. But when I stopped to look in a     window and glanced up, I saw that he had stopped eighty or ninety feet ahead of me and was     looking back, watching me.</p><p>As soon as he saw my glance he walked away, farther on up the street, where     he stopped again and looked back.</p><p>After a few more of these silent exchanges, it came to me what was going on.     Instead of following me from behind, he was following me by leading the way and looking back to     make sure that I came along.</p><p>The process continued for an entire city block and then finally, at last, I     came to an intersection and found him waiting for me.</p><p>He was tall and slender and blond and quite     handsome and seemed, somehow, to be French; he looked athletic, perhaps a tennis player or a     swimmer.</p><p>I didn’t know quite how I felt about the situation. Was I pleased, was I     flattered, was I embarrassed?</p><p>Suddenly, confronted with him, I stood at the intersection and said something     in English and he shook his head.</p><p>He said something in French and I shook my head and then both of us     laughed.</p><p>‘No French?’ he said.</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>‘No English?’ I said, and he shook his head and, again, we both laughed     because here we were, past midnight in Paris, at an intersection, unable to talk to each other     and not quite knowing what we were doing there.</p><p>At last, he lifted one hand and pointed off down a side street.</p><p>He said a name and I thought it was the name of someone: ‘Jim.’ I shook my     head in confusion.</p><p>He repeated himself, and then clarified the word. ‘Gymnasium,’ he said as he     pointed again, stepped off the walk into the street, and turned to see if I was following.</p><p>Hesitant, I waited as he walked full across the street to the far curb and     then turned again and looked at me.</p><p>I stepped off the curb and followed, thinking, What am I doing here? And     then, again, What the<emphasis>hell</emphasis>am I doing here? A strange young man at midnight, in hot weather, in Paris, going     where? To some strange gymnasium? What if I never come back? I mean, in the middle of a strange     city, how come I had the nerve to follow where someone else was leading?</p><p>I followed.</p><p>In the middle of the next block I found him waiting for me.</p><p>He nodded to a nearby building and repeated the word<emphasis>gymnasium</emphasis>. I watched as he started down some steps at the side of the building,     and ran to follow. Down we went to a basement door that he unlocked and nodded me into the     darkness.</p><p>I saw that we were indeed in a small gym with all the equipment that such     facilities have: workout machines and block horses and mats.</p><p>Most peculiar, I thought, and stepped forward as he closed the door.</p><p>From the ceiling above I heard distant music and voices speaking and the next     thing I knew I felt my shirt being unbuttoned.</p><p>I stood in the dark with perspiration running down my arms and off the tip of     my nose. I could hear the sounds of his taking off his clothes in the dark as we stood there at     midnight in Paris, not moving, not speaking.</p><p>Again I thought, What the hell am I doing here?</p><p>He took a step forward and almost touched me when suddenly there was the     sound of a door opening somewhere nearby, a burst of laughter,     another door opening and shutting, and footsteps and people talking very loudly from above.</p><p>I jumped at the noise and stood there, trembling.</p><p>He must have felt my movement, for he put out his hands, placing one on my     left shoulder, one on my right.</p><p>Both of us seemed not to know what to do next, but we stood there, facing     each other, after midnight, in Paris, like two actors onstage who had forgotten their     lines.</p><p>From above there was laughter and music and I thought I heard the popping of     a cork.</p><p>In the dim light I saw a single bead of perspiration slide down and fall off     the tip of his nose.</p><p>I felt the perspiration slip down my arms and drip off the ends of my     fingers.</p><p>We stood there for a long time, not moving, when at last he shrugged a French     shrug and I shrugged, too, and then we both laughed quietly again.</p><p>He bent forward, took my chin in one hand, and planted a quiet kiss in the     middle of my brow. Then he stepped back and reached out and put my shirt around my     shoulders.</p><p><emphasis>‘Bonne chance,’</emphasis>I thought I heard him murmur.</p><p>And then we moved quietly to the door and he put his finger to his lips and     said, ‘Shhhh,’ and we both went out into the street.</p><p>We walked together back up to the narrow avenue that led in one direction to Les Deux Magots, and in the other direction to the     river, the Louvre, and my hotel.</p><p>‘My God,’ I said quietly. ‘We’ve been together a half hour and we don’t even     know each other’s name.’</p><p>He looked at me inquiringly and some inspiration caused me to lift my hand     and jab at his chest with my finger.</p><p>‘You Jane, me Tarzan,’ I said.</p><p>This caused him to explode with laughter and repeat what I had said: ‘Me     Jane, you Tarzan.’</p><p>And for the first time since we met, we both relaxed and laughed.</p><p>Again he leaned forward and planted another quiet kiss in the middle of my     brow, then turned and walked away.</p><p>When he was three or four yards off, without turning he said, in halting     English, ‘Sorry.’</p><p>I replied, ‘Very sorry.’</p><p>‘Next time?’ he said.</p><p>‘Next,’ I replied.</p><p>And then he was gone down the narrow street, no longer leading me.</p><p>I turned back toward the river, walked on past the Louvre, and to my     hotel.</p><p>It was two o’clock in the morning, still very hot, and as I stood inside the     door to the suite I heard the bedclothes rustle and my wife said, ‘I forgot to ask earlier, did     you get the tickets?’</p><p>‘Oh yes,’ I said. ‘The Concorde, noon flight     to New York, next Tuesday.’</p><p>I heard my wife relax and then she sighed and said, ‘My God, I love Paris. I     hope we can come back next year.’</p><p>‘Next year,’ I said.</p><p>I undressed and sat on the edge of the bed. From the far side my wife said,     ‘Did you remember the pizza?’</p><p>‘The pizza?’ I said.</p><p>‘How could you have forgotten the pizza?’ she said.</p><p>‘I don’t know,’ I said.</p><p>I felt a peculiar quiet itch in the middle of my forehead and put my hand up     to touch the place where that strange young man who had followed me by leading had kissed me     good night.</p><p>‘I don’t know,’ I said, ‘how I could have forgotten. Damned if I know.’</p></body></FictionBook>
