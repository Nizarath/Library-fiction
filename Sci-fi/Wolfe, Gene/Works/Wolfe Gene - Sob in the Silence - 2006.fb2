  <section>
   <p>“This,” the horror writer told the family visiting him, “is beyond any question the least haunted house in the Midwest. No ghost, none at all, will come within miles of the place. So I am assured.”</p>
   <p>Robbie straightened his little glasses and mumbled, “Well, it looks haunted.”</p>
   <p>“It does, young man.” After teetering between seven and eight, the horror writer decided that Robbie was about seven. “It’s the filthy yellow stucco. No doubt it was a cheerful yellow once, but God only knows how long it’s been up. I’m going to have it torn off, every scrap of it, and put up fresh, which I will paint white.”</p>
   <p>“Can’t you just paint over?” Kiara asked. (Kiara of the all-conquering pout, of the golden hair and the tiny silver earrings.)</p>
   <p>Looking very serious, the horror writer nodded. And licked his lips only mentally. “I’ve tried, believe me. That hideous color is the result of air pollution—of smoke, soot, and dirt, if you will—that has clung to the stucco. Paint over it, and it bleeds out through the new paint. Washing—”</p>
   <p>“Water jets under high pressure.” Dan was Robbie’s father, and Kiara’s. “You can rent the units, or buy one for a thousand or so.”</p>
   <p>“I own one,” the horror writer told him. “With a strong cleaning agent added to the water, it will do the job.” He paused to smile. “Unfortunately, the stucco’s old and fragile. Here and there, a good jet breaks it.”</p>
   <p>“Ghosts,” Charity said. Charity was Mrs. Dan, a pudgy woman with a soft, not unattractive face and a remarkable talent for dowdy hats. “Please go back to your ghosts. I find ghosts far more interesting.”</p>
   <p>“As do I.” The horror writer favored her with his most dazzling smile. “I’ve tried repeatedly to interest psychic researchers in the old place, which has a—may I call it fascinating—history. I’ve been persuasive and persistent, and no less than three teams have checked this old place out as a result. All three have reported that they found nothing. No evidence whatsoever. No spoor of spooks. No cooperative specters a struggling author might use for research purposes.”</p>
   <p>“And publicity,” Kiara said. “Don’t forget publicity. I plan to get into public relations when I graduate.”</p>
   <p>“And publicity, you’re right. By the time you’re well settled in public relations, I hope to be wealthy enough to engage you. If I am, I will. That’s a promise.”</p>
   <p>Charity leveled a plump forefinger. “You, on the other hand, have clearly seen or heard or felt something. You had to have something more than this big dark living-room to get the psychics in, and you had it. Tell us.”</p>
   <p>The horror writer produced a sharply bent briar that showed signs of years of use. “Will this trouble anyone? I rarely smoke in here, but if we’re going to have a good long chat—well, a pipe may make things go more smoothly. Would anyone care for a drink?”</p>
   <p>Charity was quickly equipped with white wine, Dan with Johnnie Walker and water, and Robbie with cola. “A lot of the kids drink beer at IVY Tech,” Kiara announced in a tone that indicated she was one of them. “I don’t, though.”</p>
   <p>“Not until you’re twenty-one,” Dan said firmly.</p>
   <p>“You see?” She pouted.</p>
   <p>The horror writer nodded. “I do indeed. One of the things I see is that you have good parents, parents who care about you and are zealous for your welfare.” He slipped Kiara a scarcely perceptible wink. “What about a plain soda? I always find soda water over ice refreshing, myself.”</p>
   <p>Charity said, “That would be fine, if she wants it.”</p>
   <p>Kiara said she did, and he became busy behind the bar.</p>
   <p>Robbie had been watching the dark upper corners of the old, high-ceilinged room. “I thought I saw one.”</p>
   <p>“A ghost?” The horror writer looked up, his blue eyes twinkling.</p>
   <p>“A bat. Maybe we can catch it.”</p>
   <p>Dan said, “There’s probably a belfry, too.”</p>
   <p>“I’m afraid not. Perhaps I’ll add one once I get the new stucco on.”</p>
   <p>“You need one. As I’ve told my wife a dozen times, anybody who believes in ghosts has bats in his belfry.”</p>
   <p>“It’s better, perhaps,” Charity murmured, “if living things breathe and move up there. Better than just bells, rotting ropes, and dust. Tell us more about this place, please.”</p>
   <p>“It was a country house originally.” With the air of one who performed a sacrament, the horror writer poured club soda into a tall frosted glass that already contained five ice cubes and (wholly concealed by his fingers) a generous two inches of vodka. “A quiet place in which a wealthy family could get away from the heat and stench of city summers. The family was ruined somehow—I don’t recall the details. I know it’s usually the man who kills in murder-suicides, but in this house it was the woman. She shot her husband and her stepdaughters, and killed herself.”</p>
   <p>Charity said, “I could never bring myself to do that. I could never kill Dan. Or his children. I suppose I might kill myself. That’s conceivable. But not the rest.”</p>
   <p>Straight-faced, the horror writer handed his frosted glass to Kiara. “I couldn’t kill myself,” he told her. “I like myself too much. Other people? Who can say?”</p>
   <p>Robbie banged down his cola. “You’re trying to scare us!”</p>
   <p>“Of course I am. It’s my trade.”</p>
   <p>Dan asked, “They all died? That’s good shooting.”</p>
   <p>The horror writer resumed his chair and picked up his briar. “No. As a matter of fact they didn’t. One of the three stepdaughters survived. She had been shot in the head at close range, yet she lived.”</p>
   <p>Dan said, “Happens sometime.”</p>
   <p>“It does. It did in this case. Her name was Maude Parkhurst. Maude was a popular name back around nineteen hundred, which is when her parents and sisters died. Ever hear of her?”</p>
   <p>Dan shook his head.</p>
   <p>“She was left penniless and scarred for life. It seems to have disordered her thinking. Or perhaps the bullet did it. In any event, she founded her own church and was its pope and prophetess. It was called—maybe it’s still called, since it may still be around for all I know—the Unionists of Heaven and Earth.”</p>
   <p>Charity said, “I’ve heard of it. It sounded innocent enough.”</p>
   <p>The horror writer shrugged. “Today? Perhaps it is. Back then, I would say no. Decidedly no. It was, in its own fantastic fashion, about as repellent as a cult can be. May I call it a cult?”</p>
   <p>Kiara grinned prettily over her glass. “Go right ahead. I won’t object.”</p>
   <p>“A friend of mine, another Dan, once defined a cult for me. He said that if the leader gets all the women, it’s a cult.”</p>
   <p>Dan nodded. “Good man. There’s a lot to that.”</p>
   <p>“There is, but in the case of the UHE, as it was called, it didn’t apply. Maude Parkhurst didn’t want the women, or the men either. The way to get to Heaven, she told her followers, was to live like angels here on Earth.”</p>
   <p>Dan snorted.</p>
   <p>“Exactly. Any sensible person would have told them that they were not angels. That it was natural and right for angels to live like angels, but that men and women should live like human beings.”</p>
   <p>“We really know almost nothing about angels.” Charity looked pensive. “Just that they carry the Lord’s messages. It’s Saint Paul, I think, who says that each of us has an angel who acts as our advocate in Heaven. So we know that, too. But it’s really very little.”</p>
   <p>“This is about sex,” Kiara said. “I smell it coming.”</p>
   <p>The horror writer nodded. “You’re exactly right, and I’m beginning to wonder if you’re not the most intelligent person here. It is indeed. Members of the UHE were to refrain from all forms of sexual activity. If unmarried, they were not to marry. If married, they were to separate and remain separated.”</p>
   <p>“The University of Heaven at Elysium. On a T-shirt. I can see it now.”</p>
   <p>Charity coughed, the sound of it scarcely audible in the large, dark room. “Well, Kiara, I don’t see anything wrong with that if it was voluntary.”</p>
   <p>“Neither do I,” the horror writer said, “but there’s more. Those wishing to join underwent an initiation period of a year. At the end of that time, there was a midnight ceremony. If they had children, those children had to attend, all of them. There they watched their parents commit suicide—or that’s how it looked. I don’t know the details, but I know that at the end of the service they were carried out of the church, apparently lifeless and covered with blood.”</p>
   <p>Charity whispered, “Good God....”</p>
   <p>“When the congregation had gone home,” the horror writer continued, “the children were brought here. They were told that it was an orphanage, and it was operated like one. Before long it actually was one. Apparently there was some sort of tax advantage, so it was registered with the state as a church-run foundation, and from time to time the authorities sent actual orphans here. It was the age of orphanages, as you may know. Few children, if any, were put in foster homes. Normally, it was the orphanage for any child without parents or close relatives.”</p>
   <p>Dan said, “There used to be a comic strip about it, ‘Little Orphan Annie.’”</p>
   <p>The horror writer nodded. “Based upon a popular poem of the nineteenth century.</p>

   </poem>
   <p>“You see,” the horror writer finished, smiling, “in those days you could get an orphan girl from such an orphanage as this to be your maid of all work and baby-sitter. You fed and clothed her, gave her a place to sleep, and paid her nothing at all. Despite being showered with that sort of kindness, those girls picked up enough of the monstrosity and lonely emptiness of the universe to become the first practitioners of my art, the oral recounters of horrific tales whose efforts preceded all horror writing.”</p>
   <p>“Was it really so bad for them?” Kiara asked.</p>
   <p>“Here? Worse. I haven’t told you the worst yet, you see. Indeed, I haven’t even touched upon it.” The horror writer turned to Dan. “Perhaps you’d like to send Robbie out. That might be advisable.”</p>
   <p>Dan shrugged. “He watches TV. I doubt that anything you’ll say will frighten him.”</p>
   <p>Charity pursed her lips but said nothing.</p>
   <p>The horror writer had taken advantage of the pause to light his pipe. “You don’t have to stay, Robbie.” He puffed fragrant white smoke, and watched it begin its slow climb to the ceiling. “You know where your room is, and you may go anywhere in the house unless you meet with a locked door.”</p>
   <p>Kiara smiled. “Secrets! We’re in Bluebeard’s cashel—castle. I knew it!”</p>
   <p>“No secrets,” the horror writer told her, “just a very dangerous cellar stair—steep, shaky, and innocent of any sort of railing.”</p>
   <p>Robbie whispered, “I’m not going.”</p>
   <p>“So I see. From time to time, Robbie, one of the children would learn or guess that his parents were not in fact dead. When that happened, he or she might try to get away and return home. I’ve made every effort to learn just how often that happened, but the sources are contradictory on the point. Some say three and some five, and one says more than twenty. I should add that we who perform this type of research soon learn to be wary of the number three. It’s the favorite of those who don’t know the real number. There are several places on the grounds that may once have been graves—unmarked graves long since emptied by the authorities. But—”</p>
   <p>Charity leaned toward him, her face tense. “Do you mean to say that those children were killed?”</p>
   <p>The horror writer nodded. “I do. Those who were returned here by their parents were. That is the most horrible fact attached to this really quite awful old house. Or at least, it is the worst we know of—perhaps the worst that occurred.”</p>
   <p>He drew on his pipe, letting smoke trickle from his nostrils. “A special midnight service was held here, in this room in which we sit. At that service the church members are said to have flown. To have fluttered about this room like so many strange birds. No doubt they ran and waved their arms, as children sometimes do. Very possibly they thought they flew. The members of medieval witch cults seem really to have believed that they flew to the gatherings of their covens, although no sane person supposes they actually did.”</p>
   <p>Charity asked, “But you say they killed the children?”</p>
   <p>The horror writer nodded. “Yes, at the end of the ceremony. Call it the children’s hour, a term that some authorities say they used themselves. They shot them as Maude Parkhurst’s father and sisters had been shot. The executioner was chosen by lot. Maude is said to have hoped aloud that it would fall to her, as it seems to have done more than once. Twice at least.”</p>
   <p>Dan said, “It’s hard to believe anybody would really do that.”</p>
   <p>“Perhaps it is, although news broadcasts have told me of things every bit as bad. Or worse.”</p>
   <p>The horror writer drew on his pipe again, and the room had grown dark enough that the red glow from its bowl lit his face from below. “The children were asleep by that time, as Maude, her father, and her sisters had been. The lucky winner crept into the child’s bedroom, accompanied by at least one other member who carried a candle. The moment the shot was fired, the candle was blown out. The noise would’ve awakened any other children who had been sleeping in that room, of course; but they awakened only to darkness and the smell of gun smoke.”</p>
   <p>Dan said, “Angels!” There was a world of contempt in the word.</p>
   <p>“There are angels in Hell,” the horror writer told him, “not just in Heaven. Indeed, the angels of Hell may be the more numerous.”</p>
   <p>Charity pretended to yawn while nodding her reluctant agreement. “I think it’s time we all went up bed. Don’t you?”</p>
   <p>Dan said, “I certainly do. I drove one hell of a long way today.”</p>
   <p>Kiara lingered when the others had gone. “Ish really nice meeting you.” She swayed as she spoke, though only slightly. “Don’ forget I get to be your public relations agent. You promished.”</p>
   <p>“You have my word.” The horror writer smiled, knowing how much his word was worth.</p>
   <p>For a lingering moment they clasped hands. “Ish hard to believe,” she said, “that you were Dad’s roommate. You sheem—seem—so much younger.”</p>
   <p>He thanked her and watched her climb the wide curved staircase that had been the pride of the Parkhursts long ago, wondering all the while whether she knew that he was watching. Whether she knew or not, watching Kiara climb stairs was too great a pleasure to surrender.</p>
   <p>On the floor above, Charity was getting Robbie ready for bed. “You’re a brave boy, I know. Aren’t you a brave boy, darling? Say it, please. It always helps to say it.”</p>
   <p>“I’m a brave boy,” Robbie told her dutifully.</p>
   <p>“You are. I know you are. You won’t let that silly man downstairs fool you. You’ll stay in your own bed, in your own room, and get a good night’s sleep. We’ll do some sight-seeing tomorrow, forests and lakes and rugged hills where the worked-out mines hide.”</p>
   <p>Charity hesitated, gnawing with small white teeth at her full lower lip. “There’s no night-light in here, I’m afraid, but I’ve got a little flashlight in my purse. I could lend you that. Would you like it?”</p>
   <p>Robbie nodded, and clasped Charity’s little plastic flashlight tightly as he watched her leave. Her hand—the one without rings—reached up to the light switch. Her fingers found it.</p>
   <p>There was darkness.</p>
   <p>He located the switch again with the watery beam of the disposable flashlight, knowing that he would be scolded (perhaps even spanked) if he switched the solitary overhead light back on but wanting to know exactly where that switch was, just in case.</p>
   <p>At last he turned Charity’s flashlight off and lay down. It was hot in the too-large, too-empty room. Hot and silent.</p>
   <p>He sat up again, and aimed the flashlight toward the window. It was indeed open, but open only the width of his hand. He got out of bed, dropped the flashlight into the shirt pocket of his pajamas, and tried to raise the window farther. No effort he could put forth would budge it.</p>
   <p>At last he lay down again, and the room felt hotter than ever.</p>
   <p>When he had looked out through the window, it had seemed terribly high. How many flights of stairs had they climbed to get up here? He could remember only one, wide carpeted stairs that had curved as they climbed; but that one had been a long, long stair. From the window he had seen the tops of trees.</p>
   <p>Treetops and stars. The moon had been out, lighting the lawn below and showing him the dark leaves of the treetops, although the moon itself had not been in sight from the window.</p>
   <p>“It walks across the sky,” he told himself. Dan, his father, had said that once.</p>
   <p>“You could walk....” The voice seemed near, but faint and thin.</p>
   <p>Robbie switched the flashlight back on. There was no one there.</p>
   <p>Under the bed, he thought. They’re under the bed.</p>
   <p>But he dared not leave the bed to look, and lay down once more. An older person would have tried to persuade himself that he had imagined the voice, or would have left the bed to investigate. Robbie did neither. His line between palpable and imagined things was blurred and faint, and he had not the slightest desire to see the speaker, whether that speaker was real or make-believe.</p>
   <p>There were no other windows that might be opened. He thought of going out. The hall would be dark, but Dan and Charity were sleeping in a room not very far away. The door of their room might be locked, though. They did that sometimes.</p>
   <p>He would be scolded in any event. Scolded and perhaps spanked, too. It was not the pain he feared, but the humiliation. “I’ll have to go back here,” he whispered to himself. “Even if they don’t spank me, I’ll have to go back.”</p>
   <p>“You could walk away....” A girl’s voice, very faint. From the ceiling? No, Robbie decided, from the side toward the door.</p>
   <p>“No,” he said. “They’d be mad.”</p>
   <p>“You’ll die....”</p>
   <p>“Like us....”</p>
   <p>Robbie sat up, shaking.</p>
   <p>Outside, the horror writer was hiking toward the old, rented truck he had parked more than a mile away. The ground was soft after yesterday’s storm, and it was essential—absolutely essential—that there be tracks left by a strange vehicle.</p>
   <p>A turn onto a side road, a walk of a hundred yards, and the beam of his big electric lantern picked out the truck among the trees. When he could set the lantern on its hood, he put on latex gloves. Soon, very soon, the clock would strike the children’s hour and Edith with the golden hair would be his. Beautiful Kiara would be his. As for laughing Allegra, he neither knew nor cared whose she might be.</p>
   <p>“Wa’ ish?” Kiara’s voice was thick with vodka and sleep.</p>
   <p>“It’s only me,” Robbie told her, and slipped under the covers. “I’m scared.”</p>
   <p>She put a protective arm around him.</p>
   <p>“There are other kids in here. There are! They’re gone when you turn on the light, but they come back. They do!”</p>
   <p>“Uh huh.” She hugged him tighter and went back to sleep.</p>
   <p>In Scales Mound, the horror writer parked the truck and walked three blocks to his car. He had paid two weeks’ rent on the truck, he reminded himself. Had paid that rent only three days ago. It would be eleven days at least before the rental agency began to worry about it, and he could return it or send another check before then.</p>
   <p>His gun, the only gun he owned, had been concealed in a piece of nondescript luggage and locked in the car. He took it out and made sure the safety was on before starting the engine. It was only a long-barreled twenty-two; but it looked sinister, and should be sufficient to make Kiara obey if the threat of force was needed.</p>
   <p>Once she was down there…Once she was down there, she might scream all she liked. It would not matter. As he drove back to the house, he tried to decide whether he should hold it or put it into one of the big side pockets of his barn coat.</p>
   <p>Robbie, having escaped Kiara’s warm embrace, decided that her room was cooler than his. For one thing, she had two windows. For another, both were open wider than his one window had been. Besides, it was just cooler. He pulled the sheet up, hoping she would not mind.</p>
   <p>“Run....” whispered the faint, thin voices.</p>
   <p>“Run.... Run....”</p>
   <p>“Get away while you can....”</p>
   <p>“Go....”</p>
   <p>Robbie shook his head and shut his eyes.</p>
   <p>Outside Kiara’s bedroom, the horror writer patted the long-barreled pistol he had pushed into his belt. His coat pockets held rags, two short lengths of quarter-inch rope, a small roll of duct tape, and a large folding knife. He hoped to need none of them.</p>
   <p>There was no provision for locking Kiara’s door. He had been careful to see to that. No key for the quaint old lock, no interior bolt; and yet she might have blocked it with a chair. He opened it slowly, finding no obstruction.</p>
   <p>The old oak doors were thick and solid, the old walls thicker and solider still. If Dan and his wife were sleeping soundly, it would take a great deal of commotion in here to wake them.</p>
   <p>Behind him, the door swung shut on well-oiled hinges. The click of the latch was the only sound.</p>
   <p>Moonlight coming through the windows rendered the penlight in his shirt pocket unnecessary. She was there, lying on her side and sound asleep, her lovely face turned toward him.</p>
   <p>As the horror writer moved toward her, Robbie sat up, his mouth a dark circle, his pale face a mask of terror. The horror writer pushed him down again.</p>
   <p>The muzzle of his pistol was tight against Robbie’s head; this though the horror writer could not have said how it came to be there. His index finger squeezed even as he realized it was on the trigger.</p>
   <p>There was a muffled bang, like the sound of a large book dropped. Something jerked under the horror writer’s hand, and he whispered, “Die like my father. Like Alice and June. Die like me.” He whispered it, but did not understand what he intended by it.</p>
   <p>Kiara’s eyes were open. He struck her with the barrel, reversed the pistol, and struck her again and again with the butt, stopping only when he realized he did not know how many times he had hit her already or where his blows had landed.</p>
   <p>After pushing up the safety, he put the pistol back into his belt and stood listening. The room next to that in which he stood had been Robbie’s. Presumably, there was no one there to hear.</p>
   <p>The room beyond that one—the room nearest the front stair—was Dan’s and Charity’s. He would stand behind the door if they came in, shoot them both, run. Mexico. South America.</p>
   <p>They did not.</p>
   <p>The house was silent save for his own rapid breathing and Kiara’s slow, labored breaths; beyond the open windows, the night-wind sobbed in the trees. Any other sound would have come, almost, as a relief.</p>
   <p>There was none.</p>
   <p>He had broken the cellar window, left tracks with the worn old shoes he had gotten from a recycle store, left tire tracks with the old truck. He smiled faintly when he recalled its mismatched tires. Let them work on that one.</p>
   <p>He picked up Kiara and slung her over his shoulder, finding her soft, warm, and heavier than he had expected.</p>
   <p>The back stairs were narrow and in poor repair; they creaked beneath his feet, but they were farther—much farther—from the room in which Dan and Charity slept. He descended them slowly, holding Kiara with his right arm while his left hand grasped the rail.</p>
   <p>She stirred and moaned. He wondered whether he would have to hit her again, and decided he would not unless she screamed. If she screamed, he would drop her and do what had to be done.</p>
   <p>She did not.</p>
   <p>The grounds were extensive, and included a wood from which (long ago) firewood had been cut. It had grown back now, a tangle of larches and alders, firs and red cedars. Toward the back, not far from the property line, he had by merest chance stumbled upon the old well. There had been a cabin there once. No doubt it had burned. A cow or a child might have fallen into the abandoned well, and so some prudent person had covered it with a slab of limestone. Leaves and twigs on that stone had turned, in time, to soil. He had moved the stone away, leaving the soil on it largely undisturbed.</p>
   <p>When he reached the abandoned well at last, panting and sweating, he laid Kiara down. His penlight showed that her eyes were open. Her bloodstained face seemed to him a mask of fear; seeing it, he felt himself stand straighter and grow stronger.</p>
   <p>“You may listen to me or not,” he told her. “What you do really doesn’t matter, but I thought I ought to do you the kindness of explaining just what has happened and what will happen. What I plan, and your place in my plans.”</p>
   <p>She made an inarticulate sound that might have been a word or a moan.</p>
   <p>“You’re listening. Good. There’s an old well here. Only I know that it exists. At the bottom—shall we say twelve feet down? At the bottom there’s mud and a little water. You’ll get dirty, in other words, but you won’t die of thirst. There you will wait for me for as long as the police actively investigate. From time to time I may, or may not, come here and toss down a sandwich.”</p>
   <p>He smiled. “It won’t hurt you in the least, my dear, to lose a little weight. When things have quieted down, I’ll come and pull you out. You’ll be grate-ful—oh, very grateful—for your rescue. Soiled and starved, but very grateful. Together we’ll walk back to my home. You may need help, and if you do I’ll provide it.”</p>
   <p>He bent and picked her up. “I’ll bathe you, feed you, and nurse you.”</p>
   <p>Three strides brought him to the dark mouth of the well. “After that, you’ll obey me in everything. Or you had better. And in time, perhaps, you’ll come to like it.”</p>
   <p>He let her fall, smiled, and turned away.</p>
   <p>There remained only the problem of the gun. Bullets could be matched to barrels, and there was an ejected shell somewhere. The gun would have to be destroyed; it was blued steel; running water should do the job, and do it swiftly.</p>
   <p>Still smiling, he set off for the creek.</p>
   <p>It was after four o’clock the following afternoon when Captain Barlowe of the Sheriff’s Department explained the crime. Captain Barlowe was middle-aged and heavy-limbed. He had a thick mustache. “What happened in this house last night is becoming pretty clear.” His tone was weighty. “Why it happened…” He shook his head.</p>
   <p>The horror writer said, “I know my house was broken into. One of your men showed me that. I know poor little Robbie’s dead, and I know Kiara’s missing. But that’s all I know.”</p>
   <p>“Exactly.” Captain Barlowe clasped his big hands and unclasped them. “It’s pretty much all I know, too, sir. Other than that, all I can do is supply details. The gun that killed the boy was a twenty-two semi-automatic. It could have been a pistol or a rifle. It could even have been a sawed-off rifle. There’s no more common caliber in the world.”</p>
   <p>The horror writer nodded.</p>
   <p>“He was killed with one shot, a contact shot to the head, and he was probably killed for being in a room in which he had no business being. He’d left his own bed and crawled into his big sister’s. Not for sex, sir. I could see what you were thinking. He was too young for that. He was just a little kid alone in a strange house. He got lonely and was murdered for it.”</p>
   <p>Captain Barlowe paused to clear his throat. “You told my men that there had been no cars in your driveway since the rain except your own and the boy’s parents’. Is that right?”</p>
   <p>The horror writer nodded. “I’ve wracked my brain trying to think of somebody else, and come up empty. Dan and I are old friends. You ought to know that.”</p>
   <p>Captain Barlowe nodded. “I do, sir. He told me.”</p>
   <p>“We get together when we can, usually that’s once or twice a year. This year he and Charity decided to vacation in this area. He’s a golfer and a fisherman.”</p>
   <p>Captain Barlowe nodded again. “He should love our part of the state.”</p>
   <p>“That’s what I thought, Captain. I don’t play golf, but I checked out some of the courses here. I fish a bit, and I told him about that. He said he was coming, and I told him I had plenty of room. They were only going to stay for two nights.”</p>
   <p>“You kept your cellar door locked?”</p>
   <p>“Usually? No. I locked it when I heard they were coming. The cellar’s dirty and the steps are dangerous. You know how small boys are.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, sir. I used to be one. The killer jimmied it open.”</p>
   <p>The horror writer nodded. “I saw that.”</p>
   <p>“You sleep on the ground floor. You didn’t hear anything?”</p>
   <p>“No. I’m a sound sleeper.”</p>
   <p>“I understand. Here’s my problem, sir, and I hope you can help me with it. Crime requires three things. They’re motive, means, and opportunity. Know those, and you know a lot. I’ve got a murder case here. It’s the murder of a kid. I hate the bastards who kill kids, and I’ve never had a case I wanted to solve more.”</p>
   <p>“I understand,” the horror writer said.</p>
   <p>“Means is no problem. He had a gun, a car, and tools. Maybe gloves, because we haven’t found any fresh prints we can’t identify. His motive may have been robbery, but it was probably of a sexual nature. Here’s a young girl, a blonde. Very good-looking, to judge by the only picture we’ve seen so far.”</p>
   <p>“She is.” The horror writer nodded his agreement.</p>
   <p>“He must have seen her somewhere. And not just that. He must have known that she was going to be in this house last night. Where did he see her? How did he know where she was going to be? If I can find the answers to those questions we’ll get him.”</p>
   <p>“I wish I could help you.” The horror writer’s smile was inward only.</p>
   <p>“You’ve had no visitors since your guests arrived?”</p>
   <p>He shook his head. “None.”</p>
   <p>“Delivery men? A guy to fix the furnace? Something like that?”</p>
   <p>“No, nobody. They got here late yesterday afternoon, Captain.”</p>
   <p>“I understand. Now think about this, please. I want to know every-body—and I mean everybody, no matter who it was—you told that they were coming.”</p>
   <p>“I’ve thought about it. I’ve thought about it a great deal, Captain. And I didn’t tell anyone. When I went around to the golf courses, I told people I was expecting guests and they’d want to play golf. But I never said who those guests were. There was no reason to.”</p>
   <p>“That settles it.” Captain Barlowe rose, looking grim. “It’s somebody they told. The father’s given us the names of three people and he’s trying to come up with more. There may be more. He admits that. His wife…”</p>
   <p>“Hadn’t she told anyone?”</p>
   <p>“That’s just it, sir. She did. She seems to have told quite a few people and says she can’t remember them all. She’s lying because she doesn’t want her friends bothered. Well by God they’re going to be bothered. My problem—one of my problems—is that all these people are out of state. I can’t go after them myself, and I’d like to. I want to have a good look at them. I want to see their faces change when they’re asked certain questions.”</p>
   <p>He breathed deep, expanding a chest notably capacious, and let it out. “On the plus side, we’re after a stranger. Some of the local people may have seen him and noticed him. He may—I said <emphasis>may</emphasis>—be driving a car with outof-state plates.”</p>
   <p>“Couldn’t he have rented a car at the airport?” the horror writer asked.</p>
   <p>“Yes, sir. He could, and I hope to God he did. If he did, we’ll get him sure. But his car had worn tires, and that’s not characteristic of rentals.”</p>
   <p>“I see.”</p>
   <p>“If he did rent his car, it’ll have bloodstains in it, and the rental people will notice. She was bleeding when she was carried out of her bedroom.”</p>
   <p>“I didn’t know that.”</p>
   <p>“Not much, but some. We found blood in the hall and more on the back stairs. The bad thing is that if he flew in and plans to fly back out, he can’t take her with him. He’ll kill her. He may have killed her already.”</p>
   <p>Captain Barlowe left, Dan and Charity moved into a motel, and the day ended in quiet triumph. The experts who had visited the crime scene earlier reappeared and took more photographs and blood samples. The horror writer asked them no questions, and they volunteered nothing.</p>
   <p>He drove to town the next morning and shopped at several stores. So far as he could judge, he was not followed. That afternoon he got out the binoculars he had acquired years before for bird-watching and scanned the surrounding woods and fields, seeing no one.</p>
   <p>At sunrise the next morning he rescanned them, paying particular attention to areas he thought he might have slighted before. Selecting an apple from the previous day’s purchases, he made his way through grass still wet with dew to the well and tossed it in.</p>
   <p>He had hoped that she would thank him and plead for release; if she did either her voice was too faint for him to catch her words, this though it seemed to him there was a sound of some sort from the well, a faint, high humming. As he tramped back to the house, he decided that it had probably been an echo of the wind.</p>
   <p>The rest of that day he spent preparing her cellar room.</p>
   <p>He slept well that night and woke refreshed twenty minutes before his clock radio would have roused him. The three-eighths-inch rope he had bought two days earlier awaited him in the kitchen; he knotted it as soon as he had finished breakfast, spacing the knots about a foot apart.</p>
   <p>When he had wound it around his waist and tied it securely, he discovered bloodstains—small but noticeable—on the back of his barn coat. Eventually it would have to be burned, but a fire at this season would be suspicious in itself; a long soak in a strong bleach solution would have to do the job—for the present, if not permanently. Pulled out, his shirt hid the rope, although not well.</p>
   <p>When he reached the well, he tied one end of the rope to a convenient branch and called softly.</p>
   <p>There was no reply.</p>
   <p>A louder “Kiara!” brought no reply either. She was still asleep, the horror writer decided. Asleep or, just possibly, unconscious. He dropped the free end of the rope into the well, swung over the edge, and began the climb down.</p>
   <p>He had expected the length of his rope to exceed the depth of the well by three feet at least; but there came a time when his feet could find no more rope below him—or find the muddy bottom either.</p>
   <p>His pen light revealed it, eight inches, perhaps, below the soles of his shoes. Another knot down—this knot almost the last—brought his feet into contact with the mud.</p>
   <p>He released the rope.</p>
   <p>He had expected to sink into the mud, but had thought to sink to a depth of no more than three or four inches; he found himself floundering, instead, in mud up to his knees. It was difficult to retain his footing; bracing one hand against the stone side of the well, he managed to do it.</p>
   <p>At the first step he attempted, the mud sucked his shoe from his foot. Groping the mud for it got his hands thoroughly filthy, but failed to locate it. Attempting a second step cost him his other shoe as well.</p>
   <p>This time, however, his groping fingers found a large, soft thing in the mud. His pen light winked on—but in the space of twenty seconds or a little less its always-faint beam faded to darkness. His fingers told him of hair matted with mud, of an ear, and then of a small earring. When he took his hand from it, he stood among corpses, shadowy child-sized bodies his fingers could not locate. Shuddering, he looked up.</p>
   <p>Above him, far above him, a small circle of blue was bisected by the dark limb to which he had tied his rope. The rope itself swayed gently in the air, its lower end not quite out of reach.</p>
   <p>He caught it and tried to pull himself up; his hands were slippery with mud, and it escaped them.</p>
   <p>Desperately, almost frantically, he strove to catch it again, but his struggles caused him to sink deeper into the mud.</p>
   <p>He tried to climb the wall of the well; at his depth its rough stones were thick with slime.</p>
   <p>At last he recalled Kiara’s body, and by a struggle that seemed to him long he managed to get both feet on it. With its support, his fingertips once more brushed the dangling end of the rope. Bracing his right foot on what felt like the head, he made a final all-out effort.</p>
   <p>And caught the rope, grasping it a finger’s breadth from its frayed end. The slight tension he exerted on it straightened it, and perhaps stretched it a trifle. Bent the limb above by a fraction of an inch. With his right arm straining almost out of its socket and his feet pressing hard against Kiara’s corpse, the fingers of his left hand could just touch the final knot.</p>
   <p>Something took hold of his right foot, pinning toes and transverse arch in jaws that might have been those of a trap.</p>
   <p>The horror writer struggled then, and screamed again and again as he was drawn under—screamed and shrieked and begged until the stinking almost liquid mud stopped his mouth.</p>
