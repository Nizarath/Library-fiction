   <p>THE GOLDEN YEARS OF THE STAINLESS STEEL RAT</p>
   <p>Harry Harrison</p>

  <section>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Well if it isn't Dirty Old Jim diGriz!" The man's ugly face broke into an evil grin when he saw me standing there, handcuffed to the large policeman. He threw the door wide with unconcealed pleasure, stepped out as the handcuffs were removed, and took me firmly—a little too firmly—by the arm and hauled me forward. I tottered but kept my balance, shuffled through the door, passed under the verdigris-covered brass plate with its penetrating message:</p>
   <p>                                         THROUGH THIS GATE PASS THE</p>
   <p>                                                ANTIQUATED CRIMINAL</p>
   <p>                                              CROCKS OF THE GALAXY</p>
   <p>Great stuff. That's the way with the police—always kick a man when he's down. I had to shuffle faster as the sadistic attendant quickened his pace.</p>
   <p>"Got to sit—" I gasped, pulling feebly at his restricting hand as I tried to sit on the bench against the wall.</p>
   <p>"Plenty time to sit later, Pops—that's about all you will be doing. You gotta see the warden first."</p>
   <p>I could only make feeble resistance as he hauled me down the corridor to the heavy steel door. He knocked loudly. I staggered and gasped and found myself facing a mirror on the wall with an admonitory warning over it.</p>
   <p>                                                       ARE YOU CLEAN?</p>
   <p>                                                        ARE YOU NEAT?</p>
   <p>                                                 WHEN'S THE LAST TIME</p>
   <p>                                               YOU WASHED YOUR FEET?</p>
   <p>"Can't remember ..." I quavered. Looking with trembling disgust at my mirrored image. Wispy white hair tangled and matted. A white string of drool on the pendent lower lip. Skin wattled and doughy, eyes red and poochy. Not nice.</p>
   <p>"In!" my keeper ordered as a green light flickered and the door clicked open. He pushed me forward with a meaty hand; I stumbled and fought to keep my balance. Behind me the door swung shut. Before me the warden brooded over a thick file.</p>
   <p>"Yours," he said grimly, looking up at me. He had the face of an unshaven camel. "The file of a criminal. James diGriz, a.k.a. The Stainless Steel Rat." The rubbery lips twisted into a poor imitation of a smile. "Stainless no more, rusty if anything." He wheezed happily at his feeble joke, until smile turned to snarl.</p>
   <p>"I get them all, Rusty Rat. In the end they all end up before Warden Sukks. They run and hide—but finally I get them. Even the smartest criminal grows old, grows dim, makes one mistake. That's all it takes to get caught and sent to Terminal Penitentiary. That's the official name. But do you know what they really call it . . . ?"</p>
   <p>"Hell's Waiting Room!" Unwanted, the words slipped from my lips and dropped greasily to the floor.</p>
   <p>"You got it. But that's what they call it on the outside. You come in but you don't go out. In here we don't use that fancy name. We have a better one. This is the Purgy. That's short for Purgatory if you don't know. Which is a word that means ..."</p>
   <p>"I gotta go to the toilet," I wheezed, legs crossed tightly. His sneer deepened.</p>
   <p>"That's all you old crocks ever do." He thumbed a button and the door squeaked open behind me. "Bogger will show you where the heads are. Then he'll take you for your medical. We shall see that you keep fit, diGriz—so that you can enjoy our hospitality for a nice long time."</p>
   <p>His sadistic laughter followed me down the corridor. I can't say that I was overly impressed with the reception.</p>
   <p>Or the medical either. The burly, bored, and sadistic attendants stripped me naked, then slipped a flimsy gray smock over my scrawny bones. Then proceeded to drag me from one diagnostic machine to another, completely ignoring my mewling protests. Commenting offhandedly on the results.</p>
   <p>"Pin in that hip. Looks kind of old."</p>
   <p>"Not as old as those plastic knee-joints. This ancient crock has had a lot of mileage."</p>
   <p>"The doc is really going to like this one. Spots on the lung. TB or black lung or something."</p>
   <p>"Done yet?" Bogger asked, popping up like a bad memory.</p>
   <p>"Done. All yours, Bogger. Take him away."</p>
   <p>Clutching my clothes to my chest, barefooted on the cold floor, I was dragged to my cell and pushed through the door. Despite my feeble resistance Bogger pulled my clothes from me, shook the few personal objects from my pockets onto the floor, threw onto the bed an armload of coarse prison clothing and a pair of scuffs.</p>
   <p>"Dinner at six. Door unlocks a minute before. If you're late you don't eat." His sadistic chuckle was cut off by the closing door.</p>
   <p>I sat tremblingly onto the bed, dropped my face into my hands. Shivered. A sorry sight for anyone watching from any concealed pickups. The end of a proud, though criminal, man. A doomed nonagenarian reaching the end of his tether.</p>
   <p>What they could not see because my hands were over my face was the quick, happy, and successful grin. I had done it!</p>
   <p>When I raised my face the grin was gone and my lips were trembling again.</p>
   <p>The transparent cover of my cheap plastic watch was so scratched that I could barely make out the numbers. I held it up to the light, twisted it and panted with the effort, finally made out the time.</p>
   <p>"Dinner at six, oh deary me. Must get out when the door unlocks." I shuffled up to it just when the lock clicked open, pulled it wide, and stumbled through.</p>
   <p>It was pretty obvious where the chow hall was, with the feeble horde of gray-clad geriatric figures all shuffling in the same direction. I joined the shuffle, took a tray at the entrance, held it out for dollops of institutional sludge. I could not tell what it was by looking at it, knew even less after I had tasted it. Well, hopefully it contained nourishment. I spooned it up with trembling hand.</p>
   <p>"I never seen you before," the octogenarian seated beside me said suspiciously. "You a police spy?"</p>
   <p>"I'm a convicted felon."</p>
   <p>"Welcome to Purgy, heh-hee," he chuckled, cheered to see a newcomer. "Ever hijack a spaceship?"</p>
   <p>"Once or twice."</p>
   <p>"I did three. Third was a mistake. It was a decoy. But I ran out of credits, bad investments, nearing eighty and couldn't see so well . . ."</p>
   <p>The reminiscences droned on like a babbling brook and were just about as interesting. I let them burble while I finished my muckburger and gunge. As I was choking down the last depressing morsel a familiar and detested voice cut through the clatter and slurp.</p>
   <p>"Rusty Rat. You're finished with your dinner. So rattle your ancient bones to see the doc. Now."</p>
   <p>"How do I find him?"</p>
   <p>"Follow the green arrows on the wall, numbnuts. The green ones with the little red cross. Go."</p>
   <p>I dragged to my feet and went. There were arrows of different colors pointing in both directions on the corridor walls. I blinked and leaned close and made out the ones I needed. Lurched off to the left.</p>
   <p>"Come in, sit down, answer my questions, are you incontinent?" The doctor was young, in a hurry, impatient. I scratched my head and muttered.</p>
   <p>"Don't rightly know ..."</p>
   <p>"You must know!"</p>
   <p>"Not really. Don't know what the word means."</p>
   <p>"Bed-wetting! Do you wet the bed at night?"</p>
   <p>"Only when I'm drunk."</p>
   <p>"Not much chance of that in here diGriz. I've been looking at your charts. You're a wreck. Spots on the lung, pins in the hips, staples in the skull—"</p>
   <p>"I led a rough life, Doc."</p>
   <p>"Without a doubt. And your electrolytes are all skewed. I'll give you a couple of shots now to slow the deterioration, then you take one of these pills three times a day."</p>
   <p>I took the jar and blinked at the bullet-sized tablets.</p>
   <p>"Kind of big."</p>
   <p>"And you're kind of ill. Specially formulated for your multiple problems. Keep them with you at all times. A buzzer in the lid will tell you when to take one. Now—roll up your sleeve."</p>
   <p>He wielded a wicked needle. I swear the point hit bone a couple of times. With aching arms I stumbled around looking for my room, got lost, got put right by passing attendants, finally found it. The door locked when I closed it and a few minutes later the lights began to dim. I fumbled off my clothes, fumbled on the sickly orange pajamas, dropped onto the bed, and was just pulling up the covers when the lights went out.</p>
   <p>This was it. End of the line. Purgy. The purgatory before hell. Fed and healed to make the stay that much longer. The sentence with only one end.</p>
   <p>Oh yeah! I said silently to myself, and permitted a wide grin to brush my lips under the cover of the blankets. My back itched under the transparent plastic patches and I scratched them happily. They were invisible to the eye, but coated with a lead-antimony alloy that blocked X rays. I had gambled on the fact that this place would not have expensive tomographs or such—and had won. On the two-dimensional X-ray plates the plastic patches on my legs looked like metal pins, on my skull dark staples. They had done their job, would dissolve and vanish the next time I washed.</p>
   <p>I had done it! The first part of this operation was complete. Finding out about this hospital-prison had been the hardest part. It took a lot of risky work getting into planetary-government files before I managed to track it down. Risky but interesting. Guiding the twins in their successful semilegal careers had kept Angelina and me pretty busy. Now that they were successful, and rich I must add, we had been enjoying what might be called semiretirement. This suited Angelina quite well since she was happy with all those pleasure planets and luxury cruises. I, as you might very well imagine, loathed it. If I hadn't been able to polish off the occasional bank or lift a lucrative space yacht I might have gone around the twist. But it wasn't real work. Then this wonderful opportunity had revealed itself. A tiny item in the nightly news. I printed it out and brought it to Angelina. She read it swiftly, put it down in silence.</p>
   <p>"We ought to do something," I had said.</p>
   <p>"No" was her quick response.</p>
   <p>"I think we owe him something—or at least you do."</p>
   <p>"Nonsense. A grown man makes his own decisions."</p>
   <p>"Yes, of course. I still want to find out where they have sent him."</p>
   <p>When I had tracked him down and discovered the secret location of Terminal Penitentiary, I told Angelina of my plan. Her eyes narrowed as I spoke, her face grew grim. When I had finished speaking she nodded slowly.</p>
   <p>"Do it, Jim. It is dangerous and looks suicidal—but you are probably the only man in the galaxy who could pull it off. With my help, of course."</p>
   <p>"Of course. Your first task will be to find a bent but professionally competent doctor."</p>
   <p>"Not a problem. Did you ever hear of a doctor—or a lawyer—bent or not, who could resist the continual flutter of bank notes onto a tabletop?"</p>
   <p>"Now that you mention it—no. How is our expense account?"</p>
   <p>"Running a little low. We could use a few million more. Why don't you knock off a really juicy bank while I line up the medic."</p>
   <p>"Music to my ears."</p>
   <p>But almost a year went by before the preparations were complete. There would be no rushing in, guessing or taking chances. Because if every detail were not worked out to the last decimal point I was going to be spending an awful lot of time behind bars.</p>
   <p>Angelina came to pick me up at the clinic—and recoiled in horror.</p>
   <p>"Jim—you look awful!"</p>
   <p>"Thank you. It was quite an effort. Losing weight was easy enough, as well as skin aging, hair dyeing, all the usual things. It's the muscles I miss the most."</p>
   <p>"Me too. Your gorgeous figure—"</p>
   <p>"Wasted away with enzymes. No choice. If I am going to pass for an ancient crock I have to look like one. Don't worry, a few months of bodybuilding when this is over and I'll be as good as new."</p>
   <p>A tear glistened in her eyes and she gave me a warm hug. "And you're doing this for me."</p>
   <p>"Of course. But for him as well—and for Jim diGriz so I can look at myself in the mirror. Not that I really want to just now."</p>
   <p>And that had been that. Pulling off an inept jewel robbery and getting nicked had been the easy part. I just made sure that the crime was committed on Heliotrope-2, the site of the original news report that had started this entire thing rolling.</p>
   <p>It had rolled well. Here I was in Purgy and I had one week to acquaint myself with the layout, the alarms and videoscanners, before the operation went into phase two. It was time well spent. At breakfast next morning I looked around at all the bald heads and gray polls of my fellow inmates and found him at once. And stayed away. Time enough to renew an old acquaintance at the proper moment. As I spooned up the purple gruel I took everything in. And started with surprise.</p>
   <p>Could it be him? Yes, it was. His hair was white now, his face tracked with countless wrinkles. But after two months together in an ice cave—well, there are things you just don't forget. I followed him after we had dumped our trays, sat down next to him in the morning room.</p>
   <p>"Been here long, Burin?" I asked.</p>
   <p>He turned his head and blinked at me nearsightedly—then his face lit up with a smile.</p>
   <p>"Jimmy diGriz as I live and breathe!"</p>
   <p>"And I'm most glad that you are living and breathing! Burin Bache, the best forger in the history of the galaxy."</p>
   <p>"Kind of you to say that, Jimmy. And it was true at one time. Not lately—" The smile faded and I quickly put my arm around him.</p>
   <p>"Do you still get chilblains in your ankles?"</p>
   <p>"You bet I do! You know—I still can't put ice into a drink. Hate the sight of it."</p>
   <p>"Yes, but the ice cave was only a hiccup. . . ."</p>
   <p>"Some hiccup! But you're right there, Jimmy me lad. After what we hauled down on that job I didn't have to work for ten years. You were young but you were a genius. Hate to see you ending up here like me. Never thought they would get you."</p>
   <p>"Happens to the best of us."</p>
   <p>As I spoke I had my stilo concealed in my cupped hands, printing a quick message on my palm. Then I rubbed my chin with the back of my hand and waited until Burin had looked at it, his eyes widening.</p>
   <p>"Got to go now," I said as I blurred the message with a saliva-dampened fingertip. "See you around."</p>
   <p>He could only nod shocked and silent agreement as I left. I couldn't blame him. Since his incarceration I am sure he never thought he would ever read those words.</p>
   <p>WE'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE.</p>
   <p>The immense bribe that Angelina had paid to the city official had been well worth it. The building permission floorplans had not been complete—but they sufficed. I got close to the room we had selected on the second day, stuffed my stilo into the keyhole on the third. After being held in my armpit for an hour, the memory plastic of which it was made had softened to the consistency of clay. A moment after being pressed against the cold metal it had hardened into a perfect mirror image of the lock's innards.</p>
   <p>We were permitted an hour in the garden every day and I had found a bench that was well away from any sites that might have held videoscanners. I sat there, apparently dozing over an open book. You would have to stand very close to see what I was doing.</p>
   <p>That morning I had stripped off part of the plastic covering of my battered wallet. And chewed it well. It had not tasted as bad as some of the meals we had consumed. It had reacted with my saliva and had softened to a nice doughy consistency. And had remained that way in the darkness of my pocket. Now I pressed it against the mold of the lock's interior. It should be shaped to duplicate the key that would open it. When I was satisfied with the effort I held the plastic in the warm sunshine. The catalyst it contained reacted with the light and it hardened instantly.</p>
   <p>Logically I should have waited for the right moment to try to open that door. But I had to make a dry run. Get any problems out of the way so I could move quickly and smoothly at the decided time.</p>
   <p>Burin was more than happy to help. We synchronized watches and at the precise moment I reached the door he stumbled and fell onto the table where the card game was in progress. There was a great crashing, shouts of anger and dismay as I slipped the homemade key into the keyhole. Turned and pressed.</p>
   <p>Nothing happened. I took a deep breath, held it—then used every iota of skill acquired during a lifetime of lockpicking.</p>
   <p>It grated slightly—and the door opened.</p>
   <p>I was through in an instant, closing and locking it behind me. Listening for footsteps, shouts of alarm.</p>
   <p>Nothing. Only then did I look around me. I was in a small storeroom piled high with reams of paper and mounds of forms so dear to the bureaucratic heart. There was enough light from the small window to see clearly. I memorized the layout of the room, then moved one box that blocked a direct path. Enough. Time to go. I was too close to D Day, H Hour, M Minute to get into any trouble now. Silence in the hall. Through the door, lock it, stroll back to the morning room, where a sort of antique fistfight was going on. I was sorry we had to spoil their game. No, I really wasn't. Burin glanced in my direction and I flashed him a sort of conspiratorial wink, or tic, then passed on.</p>
   <p>Angelina and I had agreed on absolutely minimum contact this first meeting. And the timing was crucial. It had to be after dark for concealment—but not so late that we had been packed off beddy-byes. On the selected evening I was first through the door after dinner, stumbling swiftly in the direction of the heads. Past that door and up the stairs. I had cut it too close, only seconds left. Lock and relock the door, tread quickly the few steps along the memorized path—my watch ready in my hand.</p>
   <p>Grasped in both hands so I could draw the watch strap back and forth across the window lock with a quick sawing motion. This stripped away the surface plastic that covered the far harder plasteel of the flexible saw inside. It rasped noisily until there was a sharp click. I stuffed the watch into my pocket, seized the window, and pulled it open.</p>
   <p>Angelina, all in black, black gloves and blackened face, was outside. She pushed the package into my hands. Despite our agreement she could not resist a softly hissed "About time!" as I pushed the window shut.</p>
   <p>I retired at once, the bundle concealed in my clothing, pushed under the pillow as I got into bed. I left it there after I had worked the detector out of it.</p>
   <p>Soon after the lights were out I began to toss and turn.</p>
   <p>"Can't sleep," I moaned. "Insomnia and arthritis got me down. Groan."</p>
   <p>I thrashed a bit longer, then rose and stumbled about the room rubbing my leg. Rubbing the controls on the detector as well with gratifying results. There was only a single detector over the door. Which left at least two blank spots in the room out of its field of view. A good night's sleep was now in order, because there was plenty to do on the morrow.</p>
   <p>It was almost noon before I went looking for Burin Bache, sat down next to him in the sun porch. He raised his eyebrows quizzically but I did not respond until I had moved about a bit with the detector.</p>
   <p>"Great," I said. "Just don't talk too loud. Contact has been made."</p>
   <p>"Then you have everything?" He was trembling with excitement.</p>
   <p>"Everything. Most of it hidden where they can't find it. Let's go out into the garden in exactly twelve minutes."</p>
   <p>"Why?"</p>
   <p>"Because concealed in my mouth is an optical laser communicator." I opened my lips to reveal the lens. "I can hear through my hard palate."</p>
   <p>"Hear what?" He was mystified.</p>
   <p>"The dulcet tones of my dear Angelina, who even now is making her way to the upper floors of that office building that you can just see peeking over the wall in the distance. Untap-pable communication. Let's go."</p>
   <p>I leaned back in the deck chair and at the proper moment smiled in the direction of the distant building. My aim didn't have to be too precise since she would have opened up a two-meter receiving lens.</p>
   <p>"Good morning, my love."</p>
   <p>"Jim, I'm sorry we ever got involved with this insane plan," her voice said squeakily through my head bones.</p>
   <p>"Only way out now is full steam ahead."</p>
   <p>"I know that. And I didn't enjoy climbing your building— even with molecular grappling gloves and boots."</p>
   <p>"But you did it, my love. You are strong and skillful—"</p>
   <p>"If you dare add—for a woman of my age—I will skin you alive when you get out!"</p>
   <p>"The farthest thought from my mind. What I wanted to ask is—do you think we can take out two instead of one? I have found an old acquaintance here who, truthfully, saved my life once. In an ice cave. I'll tell you about it one day. How about it?"</p>
   <p>She hesitated a moment and I could imagine her sweet little frown of concentration. My Angelina does not speak until she is certain.</p>
   <p>"Yes, of course. I'll just have to change transportation."</p>
   <p>"Good. If you are changing transportation make sure the vehicle is big enough."</p>
   <p>"For four?"</p>
   <p>"Not really. What I had in mind was well, a figure a little closer to sixty-five. . . ."</p>
   <p>"Message breaking up. Repeat last. It came through as sixty-five."</p>
   <p>"Right! Bang-on! That is correct!" I tried to sound cheerful and not smarmy. She was not fooled.</p>
   <p>"Don't try it on, diGriz—I know you. Sixty-five—that must be every inmate there."</p>
   <p>"Correct, my love. Exact number. I would suggest a tourist bus. I did this kind of thing once before and it worked. Locate the bus and I'll get back to you same time tomorrow with more details. Must go—someone coming." I clicked off. We were still unobserved but I wanted Angelina's justified wrath to have twenty-four hours to cool before I talked to her again.</p>
   <p>"What happened?" Burin asked. "I could hear you mumble a bit, that's all."</p>
   <p>"Gears meshing like clockwork. Couldn't be better. My dear wife is filled with wild enthusiasm for the plan. Particularly its new dimension."</p>
   <p>"What—?"</p>
   <p>"Details later. Let's go in to lunch now. Don't drink the water."</p>
   <p>"Why not?"</p>
   <p>"I tested it this morning. Laced with pacifiers, saltpeter and brain-scrambling drugs. That's why the inmates mumble and stagger around so much. I think almost all of them are in far better shape than what we see."</p>
   <p>Angelina's anger had cooled when we talked the next day. More than cooled. Her voice, even vibrating buzzily through my ear bones, had a positive chill that brought back memory of the ice cave.</p>
   <p>"I have the bus. Bought legally. What else will I need?"</p>
   <p>"A bus driver's uniform for yourself to explain your graceful presence behind the wheel. And, well—a few other items—"</p>
   <p>"Like what?" Temperature of liquid nitrogen. When I had dictated the list her voice was approaching absolute zero.</p>
   <p>"This is the most insane, harebrained, impossible plan that I have ever heard. I shall make every effort to see that it does not fail, that you are not injured and escape in one piece. So I can then personally kill you myself."</p>
   <p>"My love—you jest."</p>
   <p>"Try me." She clicked off.</p>
   <p>Maybe it wasn't such a great idea. But now that I had started down this path I had to go all the way. For the first time I was more depressed than excited. Too much of the drinking water maybe. Then I remembered the medicine I had put into the bundle for just such a moment as this.</p>
   <p>Out of sight of the pickup above my door I opened the wall grate and removed the plastic bottle labeled danger—high explosive. In a way it was. One hundred and ten proof and twelve years in the barrel. My good humor returned in a surge.</p>
   <p>For six more days Angelina and I had our daily chat by laser. Formal and brief no matter how I tried to be friendly and crack the occasional joke. All this was ignored. My darling was in a temper. With good reason, I sighed. Only thing to do was get on with it.</p>
   <p>On the seventh day our conversation was most one-sided. She spoke a single word and disconnected. I turned off the transmitter with my tongue and turned to Burin—who looked much more alert now that he wasn't drinking water with his meals.</p>
   <p>"The date is set."</p>
   <p>"When?"</p>
   <p>"I'll tell you after dinner."</p>
   <p>He started to speak—then clamped his mouth shut. Appreciating the wisdom of my decision. The fewer that knew the less chance of any slipups. A maximum of one keeps a secret a secret.</p>
   <p>That evening when the rattle of spoons on metal had slowed and the slurping of the jellied gray dessert had replaced it, I took my tray into the kitchen, came out without it, and closed the door. Was watched by some of the slurpers with bleary-eyed interest as I slipped a tiny metal packet over the cable to the pickup on the wall.</p>
   <p>"May I have your attention," I called out, hammering on the table with a spoon. I waited until the hum of voices had died down—then pointed to the side door.</p>
   <p>"We are all going to leave now by that side door. The gentleman who is now opening it, Burin Bache, is your guide. You will follow him." I had to raise my voice to be heard over the babble of voices. "You will shut up now and ask no questions. All will be revealed later. But I can tell you now that the authorities will definitely not like what we are going to do."</p>
   <p>This drew nods of approval since every inmate was here because of flouting the law and thumbing the nose at authority. This, plus all the hypnotics in the drinking water, had them trooping out quietly following my orders. I stood by the door, smiling and patting an occasional shoulder as they went by, working hard not to show any impatience.</p>
   <p>With each passing minute there was a growing chance that the mass escape might be discovered. The kitchen staff and two guards were sleeping quietly in the storeroom; the wall pickup was transmitting a recording of happy diners munching away. And the two other doors were locked. That was the weak spot in the plan. Normally no one came into the dining area during a meal. But there were exceptions. I crossed my fingers behind my back hoping that this wasn't one of the exceptional days.</p>
   <p>As the last bent shoulder moved by in front of me I sighed with relief, stepped through, and locked the door behind me. Followed my shuffling colleagues down the stairs to the service corridor, closing and locking each door after going through it. I did the same thing as we passed through the cellar, to the boiler room at the far end. The fire door here was heavier and slid closed with a satisfactory thud.</p>
   <p>I turned to look at my colleagues, wringing my hands with pleasure.</p>
   <p>"What's happening?" one of them called out.</p>
   <p>"We are leaving here," I looked at my watch, "In exactly seven minutes!"</p>
   <p>As might very well be imagined that caused no little stir. I listened to the voices then shouted them to silence.</p>
   <p>"No—I'm not mad. Nor am I as old as I look. I had myself arrested and incarcerated in this place for only one reason. To crack out. I will now pass through you, that's it, move aside, thank you, to the far wall. You may or may not know that this prison is built on a hillside. Which means that while the other end of the building is deep in the earth and rock—this end is level with the road outside. Will you all kindly move to the far side of the room, that's it. As you can see I am placing a shaped charge of macrothermite on the wall. When ignited this not only burns but penetrates and keeps on burning until it reaches the other side."</p>
   <p>They watched in tense silence as I patted into place a rough circle of the doughy substance, then sprayed it with sealant and pushed in an igniter.</p>
   <p>"Push close together—get as far away as you can," I ordered, looking at my watch. When there were five seconds to go I pushed the igniter button and hurried to join them.</p>
   <p>It was most dramatic. The igniter flared and a ring of fire sprang out from the wall. It crackled and flamed and smoked;there was a lot of coughing as the smoke spread and the vent fans labored to clear it. Then I pulled the hose from the reel and opened the valve to spray water on the wall. There were cries of fear and more serious coughing as clouds of steam added to the discomfort.</p>
   <p>The hissing and crackling died down and I turned off the water, strode forward. I raised my foot and gave a good push against the circle of wall. It obliged me by falling outward with a rumbling crash.</p>
   <p>"Lights out!" I ordered, and Burin threw the switches.</p>
   <p>A streetlight lit up the ground outside, revealed the roll of carpeting. This began to rotate and the flexpowered end crept in through the opening. The carpet was red as I had ordered.</p>
   <p>"Let's get out of here! One at a time. No talking and don't touch the wall or the ground. Stay on the carpet, which is heatproof. Burin—over here."</p>
   <p>"It's working, Jim—it's actually working!"</p>
   <p>"Your faith is touching. Make sure they are all out before you leave."</p>
   <p>"Will do!"</p>
   <p>I joined the line of shambling figures, hurried along the carpet, and jumped off to join the neatly uniformed figure of my wife.</p>
   <p>"My love—"</p>
   <p>"Shut up," she suggested. "There's the bus. Get them aboard."</p>
   <p>There it was indeed. Engine idling, coachwork gleaming. A large banner on the side bore the message—</p>
   <p>                                                     RETIREES MYSTERY TOUR</p>
   <p>"This way," I said and turned the nearest man in the right direction and led the way to the door. "Go to the rear and find a seat. Put on the clothes that you will find on the seat—and the wig as well. Go."</p>
   <p>I repeated this until Burin appeared. He took over the message muttering while I herded the remainder aboard. Angelina climbed in as well and sat in silence in the driver's seat.</p>
   <p>"That's the lot," I said as cheerfully as I could.</p>
   <p>"Door closed and we're away! I did this once before, years ago, only with bicycles." I turned and nodded approval at the gray wigs and dresses, at what appeared to be a busload of old ladies.</p>
   <p>"Well done," I shouted. "Very well done."</p>
   <p>And that was very well that. Other than my wife's cold silence everything was just about perfect. We rolled merrily into the night and were well out of the city before we saw a police checkpoint ahead. I struggled into a dress, popped on the wig, then led all the assembled ladies in a sing-song of "Row, row, row your boat—"</p>
   <p>The bus had barely rolled to a stop before we were told to move on. There was many a high-pitched shriek of joy and a flutter of waved handkerchiefs as we left.</p>
   <p>It was almost midnight before the headlights lit up the sign:</p>
   <p>                           BIDE-A-WEE RETIREMENT HOME FOR GENTEEL LADIES.</p>
   <p>I jumped out and opened the gate, then closed it behind the bus.</p>
   <p>"Inside, ladies," I called out. "Tea and cakes waiting—as well as a self-service bar."</p>
   <p>This last drew shouts of hoarse pleasure as they streamed inside, dresses and wigs now cast aside. Angelina signaled me over and I hurried to her side.</p>
   <p>"What do I say to him?"</p>
   <p>"I thought you were angry with me?"</p>
   <p>"That's long past. It's just. . ."</p>
   <p>He stood aside from the others, saw us talking. Walked slowly over to join us.</p>
   <p>"I must thank you both—for what you have done for all of us."</p>
   <p>"It just worked out that way, Pepe," I said. "The truth is we set the whole thing up to spring you out of that place. The operation sort of, well, grew a bit after that."</p>
   <p>"Then you still remember me, Angelina? I recognized you at once." He smiled warmly and his eyes grew damp.</p>
   <p>"It was my idea," I said quickly, before things got out of hand. "I saw this item in the news and felt obligated to do something. For old times' sake at least. Since I was the one who arrested you for stealing the battleship."</p>
   <p>"And I was the one who led you into a life of crime," Angelina said firmly. "We felt a certain—responsibility."</p>
   <p>"Particularly since we have been happily married for years and have two fine sons. If you two had not been partners I would have never met the light of my life," I added to make sure all the ground rules were known. Pepe Nero nodded and knuckled his eye.</p>
   <p>"I guess about all I can say is... thanks. So it all comes out even in the end. I think I was always suited for crime, Angelina. You just set my foot on the right road. Now I am going to have a really large drink."</p>
   <p>"That is a really great idea," I agreed.</p>
   <p>"A toast!" Burin called out. "Jim and Angelina—our saviors. Thanks for life!"</p>
   <p>Cups and glasses were raised—as well as a hoarse cheer from all present. I put my arm around her waist and this time it was I who had the tear in my eye.</p>
