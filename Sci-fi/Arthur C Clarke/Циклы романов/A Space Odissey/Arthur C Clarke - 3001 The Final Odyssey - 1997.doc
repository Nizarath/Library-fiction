PROLOGUE\par
\par
The Firstborn\par
   \par
\par
    Call them the Firstborn. Though they were not remotely human, they were \par
flesh and blood, and when they looked out across the deeps of space, they felt \par
awe, and wonder - and loneliness. As soon as they possessed the power, they \par
began to seek for fellowship among the stars.\par
\par
    In their explorations, they encountered life in many forms, and watched the \par
workings of evolution on a thousand worlds. They saw how often the first faint \par
sparks of intelligence flickered and died in the cosmic night.\par
\par
    And because, in all the Galaxy, they had found nothing more precious than \par
Mind, they encouraged its dawning everywhere. They became farmers in the fields \par
of stars; they sowed, and sometimes they reaped.\par
\par
    And sometimes, dispassionately, they had to weed.\par
\par
    The great dinosaurs had long since passed away, their morning promise \par
annihilated by a random hammerblow from space, when the survey ship entered the \par
Solar System after a voyage that had already lasted a thousand years. It swept \par
past the frozen outer planets, paused briefly above the deserts of dying Mars, \par
and presently looked down on Earth.\par
\par
    Spread out beneath them, the explorers saw a world swarming with life. For \par
years they studied, collected, catalogued. When they had learned all that they \par
could, they began to modify. They tinkered with the destiny of many species, on \par
land and in the seas. But which of their experiments would bear fruit, they \par
could not know for at least a million years.\par
\par
    They were patient, but they were not yet immortal. There was so much to do \par
in this universe of a hundred billion suns, and other worlds were calling. So \par
they set out once more into the abyss, knowing that they would never come this \par
way again. Nor was there any need: the servants they had left behind would do \par
the rest.\par
\par
    On Earth, the glaciers came and went, while above them the changeless Moon \par
still carried its secret from the stars. With a yet slower rhythm than the polar \par
ice, the tides of civilization ebbed and flowed across the Galaxy. Strange and \par
beautiful and terrible empires rose and fell, and passed on their knowledge to \par
their successors.\par
\par
    And now, out among the stars, evolution was driving towards new goals. The \par
first explorers of Earth had long since come to the limits of flesh and blood; \par
as soon as their machines were better than their bodies, it was time to move. \par
First their brains, and then their thoughts alone, they transferred into shining \par
new homes of metal and gemstone. In these, they roamed the Galaxy. They no \par
longer built spaceships. They were spaceships.\par
\par
    But the age of the Machine-entities swiftly passed. In their ceaseless \par
experimenting, they had learned to store knowledge in the structure of space \par
itself, and to preserve their thoughts for eternity in frozen lattices of light.\par
\par
    Into pure energy, therefore, they presently transformed themselves; and on a \par
thousand worlds, the empty shells they had discarded twitched for a while in a \par
mindless dance of death, then crumbled into dust.\par
\par
    Now they were Lords of the Galaxy, and could rove at will among the stars, \par
or sink like a subtle mist through the very interstices of space. Though they \par
were freed at last from the tyranny of matter, they had not wholly forgotten \par
their origin, in the warm slime of a vanished sea. And their marvellous \par
instruments still continued to function, watching over the experiments started \par
so many ages ago.\par
\par
    But no longer were they always obedient to the mandates of their creators; \par
like all material things, they were not immune to the corruption of Time and its \par
patient, unsleeping servant, Entropy.\par
\par
    And sometimes, they discovered and sought goals of their own.\par

1\par
Comet Cowboy\par
\par
    \par
\par
    Captain Dimitri Chandler [M2973.04.21/93.106//Mars//I SpaceAcad3005] - or \par
'Dim' to his very best friends - was understandably annoyed. The message from \par
Earth had taken six hours to reach the space-tug Goliath, here beyond the orbit \par
of Neptune; if it had arrived ten minutes later he could have answered 'Sorry - \par
can't leave now - we've just started to deploy the sun-screen.'\par
\par
    The excuse would have been perfectly valid: wrapping a comet's core in a \par
sheet of reflective film only a few molecules thick, but kilometres on a side, \par
was not the sort of job you could abandon while it was half-completed.\par
\par
    Still, it would be a good idea to obey this ridiculous request: he was \par
already in disfavour sunwards, through no fault of his own. Collecting ice from \par
the rings of Saturn, and nudging it towards Venus and Mercury, where it was \par
really needed, had started back in the 2700s - three centuries ago. Captain \par
Chandler had never been able to see any real difference in the 'before and \par
after' images the Solar Conservers were always producing, to support their \par
accusations of celestial vandalism. But the general public, still sensitive to \par
the ecological disasters of previous centuries, had thought otherwise, and the \par
'Hands off Saturn!' vote had passed by a substantial majority. As a result, \par
Chandler was no longer a Ring Rustler, but a Comet Cowboy.\par
\par
    So here he was at an appreciable fraction of the distance to Alpha Centauri, \par
rounding up stragglers from the Kuiper Belt. There was certainly enough ice out \par
here to cover Mercury and Venus with oceans kilometres deep, but it might take \par
centuries to extinguish their hell-fires and make them suitable for life. The \par
Solar Conservers, of course, were still protesting against this, though no \par
longer with so much enthusiasm. The millions dead from the tsunami caused by the \par
Pacific asteroid in 2304 - how ironic that a land impact would have done much \par
less damage! - had reminded all future generations that the human race had too \par
many eggs in one fragile basket.\par
\par
    Well, Chandler told himself, it would be fifty years before this particular \par
package reached its destination, so a delay of a week would hardly make much \par
difference. But all the calculations about rotation, centre of mass, and thrust \par
vectors would have to be redone, and radioed back to Mars for checking. It was a \par
good idea to do your sums carefully, before nudging billions of tons of ice \par
along an orbit that might take it within hailing distance of Earth.\par
\par
    As they had done so many times before, Captain Chandler's eyes strayed \par
towards the ancient photograph above his desk. It showed a three-masted \par
steamship, dwarfed by the iceberg that was looming above it - as, indeed, \par
Goliath was dwarfed at this very moment.\par
\par
    How incredible, he had often thought, that only one long lifetime spanned \par
the gulf between this primitive Discovery and the ship that had carried the same \par
name to Jupiter! And what would those Antarctic explorers of a thousand years \par
ago have made of the view from his bridge? They would certainly have been \par
disoriented, for the wall of ice beside which Goliath was floating stretched \par
both upwards and downwards as far as the eye could see. And it was strange-\par
looking ice, wholly lacking the immaculate whites and blues of the frozen Polar \par
seas. In fact, it looked dirty - as indeed it was. For only some ninety per cent \par
was water-ice: the rest was a witch's brew of carbon and sulphur compounds, most \par
of them stable only at temperatures not far above absolute zero. Thawing them \par
out could produce unpleasant surprises: as one astrochemist had famously \par
remarked, 'Comets have bad breath'.\par
\par
    'Skipper to all personnel,' Chandler announced. 'There's been a slight \par
change of programme. We've been asked to delay operations, to investigate a \par
target that Spaceguard radar has picked up.'\par
\par
    'Any details?' somebody asked, when the chorus of groans over the ship's \par
intercom had died away.\par
\par
    'Not many, but I gather it's another Millennium Committee project they've \par
forgotten to cancel.'\par
\par
    More groans: everyone had become heartily sick of all the events planned to \par
celebrate the end of the 2000s. There had been a general sigh of relief when 1 \par
January 3001 had passed uneventfully, and the human race could resume its normal \par
activities.\par
\par
    'Anyway, it will probably be another false alarm, like the last one. We'll \par
get back to work just as quickly as we can. Skipper out.'\par
\par
    This was the third wild-goose-chase, Chandler thought morosely, he'd been \par
involved with during his career. Despite centuries of exploration, the Solar \par
System could still produce surprises, and presumably Spaceguard had a good \par
reason for its request. He only hoped that some imaginative idiot hadn't once \par
again sighted the fabled Golden Asteroid. If it did exist - which Chandler did \par
not for a moment believe - it would be no more than a mineralogical curiosity: \par
it would be of far less real value than the ice he was nudging sunwards, to \par
bring life to barren worlds.\par
\par
    There was one possibility, however, which he did take quite seriously. \par
Already, the human race had scattered its robot probes through a volume of space \par
a hundred light-years across - and the Tycho Monolith was sufficient reminder \par
that much older civilizations had engaged in similar activities. There might \par
well be other alien artefacts in the Solar System, or in transit through it. \par
Captain Chandler suspected that Spaceguard had something like this in mind: \par
otherwise it would hardly have diverted a Class I space-tug to go chasing after \par
an unidentified radar blip.\par
\par
    Five hours later, the questing Goliath detected the echo at extreme range; \par
even allowing for the distance, it seemed disappointingly small. However, as it \par
grew clearer and stronger, it began to give the signature of a metallic object, \par
perhaps a couple of metres long. It was travelling on an orbit heading out of \par
the Solar System, so was almost certainly, Chandler decided, one of the myriad \par
pieces of space-junk that Mankind had tossed towards the stars during the last \par
millennium and which might one day provide the only evidence that the human race \par
had ever existed.\par
\par
    Then it came close enough for visual inspection, and Captain Chandler \par
realized, with awed astonishment, that some patient historian was still checking \par
the earliest records of the Space Age. What a pity that the computers had given \par
him the answer, just a few years too late for the Mifiermium celebrations!\par
\par
    'Goliath here,' Chandler radioed Earthwards, his voice tinged with pride as \par
well as solemnity. 'We're bringing aboard a thousand-year-old astronaut. And I \par
can guess who it is.'\par
\par
    \par
\par
2\par
Awakening\par
\par
    \par
\par
    Frank Poole awoke, but he did not remember. He was not even sure of his \par
name.\par
\par
    Obviously, he was in a hospital room: even though his eyes were still \par
closed, the most primitive, and evocative, of his senses told him that. Each \par
breath brought the faint and not unpleasant tang of antiseptics in the air, and \par
it triggered a memory of the time when - of course! - as a reckless teenager he \par
had broken a rib in the Arizona Hang-gliding Championship.\par
\par
    Now it was all beginning to come back. I'm Deputy Commander Frank Poole, \par
Executive Officer, USSS Discovery, on a Top Secret mission to Jupiter - It \par
seemed as if an icy hand had gripped his heart. He remembered, in slow-motion \par
playback, that runaway space-pod jetting towards him, metal claws outstretched. \par
Then the silent impact - and the not-so-silent hiss of air rushing out of his \par
suit. After that - one last memory, of spinning helplessly in space, trying in \par
vain to reconnect his broken air-hose.\par
\par
    Well, whatever mysterious accident had happened to the space-pod controls, \par
he was safe now. Presumably Dave had made a quick EVA and rescued him before \par
lack of oxygen could do permanent brain damage.\par
\par
    Good old Dave! He told himself. I must thank - just a moment! - I'm \par
obviously not aboard Discovery now - surely I haven't been unconscious long \par
enough to be taken back to Earth!\par
\par
    His confused train of thought was abruptly broken by the arrival of a Matron \par
and two nurses, wearing the immemorial uniform of their profession. They seemed \par
a little surprised: Poole wondered if he had awakened ahead of schedule, and the \par
idea gave him a childish feeling of satisfaction.\par
\par
    'Hello!' he said, after several attempts; his vocal cords appeared to be \par
very rusty. 'How am I doing?'\par
\par
    Matron smiled back at him and gave an obvious 'Don't try to talk' command by \par
putting a finger to her lips. Then the two nurses fussed swiftly over him with \par
practised skill, checking pulse, temperature, reflexes. When one of them lifted \par
his right arm and let it drop again, Poole noticed something peculiar It fell \par
slowly, and did not seem to weigh as much as normal. Nor, for that matter, did \par
his body, when he attempted to move.\par
\par
    So I must be on a planet, he thought. Or a space-station with artificial \par
gravity. Certainly not Earth - I don't weigh enough.\par
\par
    He was about to ask the obvious question when Matron pressed something \par
against the side of his neck; he felt a slight tingling sensation, and sank back \par
into a dreamless sleep. Just before he became unconscious, he had time for one \par
more puzzled thought.\par
\par
    How odd - they never spoke a single word - all the time they were with me.\par
\par
    \par
\par
3\par
Rehabilitation\par
\par
    \par
\par
    When he woke again, and found Matron and nurses standing round his bed, \par
Poole felt strong enough to assert himself.\par
\par
    'Where am I? Surely you can tell me that!' The three women exchanged \par
glances, obviously uncertain what to do next. Then Matron answered, enunciating \par
her words very slowly and carefully: 'Everything is fine, Mr Poole. Professor \par
Anderson will be here in a minute He will explain.'\par
\par
    Explain what? thought Poole with some exasperation. But at least she speaks \par
English, even though I can't place her accent.\par
\par
    Anderson must have been already on his way, for the door opened moments \par
later - to give Poole a brief glimpse of a small crowd of inquisitive onlookers \par
peering in at him. He began to feel like a new exhibit at a zoo.\par
\par
    Professor Anderson was a small, dapper man whose features seemed to have \par
combined key aspects of several races - Chinese, Polynesian, Nordic - in a \par
thoroughly confusing fashion. He greeted Poole by holding up his right palm, \par
then did an obvious double-take and shook hands, with such a curious hesitation \par
that he might have been rehearsing some quite unfamiliar gesture.\par
\par
    'Glad to see you're looking so well, Mr Poole... We'll have you up in no \par
time.'\par
\par
    Again that odd accent and slow delivery - but the confident bedside manner \par
was that of all doctors, in all places and all ages.\par
\par
    'I'm glad to hear it. Now perhaps you can answer a few questions...'\par
\par
    'Of course, of course. But just a minute.'\par
\par
    Anderson spoke so rapidly and quietly to the Matron that Poole could catch \par
only a few words, several of which were wholly unfamiliar to him. Then the \par
Matron nodded at one of the nurses, who opened a wall-cupboard and produced a \par
slim metal band, which she proceeded to wrap around Poole's head.\par
\par
    'What's that for?' he asked - being one of those difficult patients, so \par
annoying to doctors, who always want to know just what's happening to them. 'EEC \par
readout?'\par
\par
    Professor, Matron and nurses looked equally baffled. Then a slow smile \par
spread across Anderson's face.\par
\par
    'Oh - electro... enceph .. alo... gram,' he said slowly, as if dredging the \par
word up from the depth of memory, 'You're quite right. We just want to monitor \par
your brain functions.'\par
\par
    My brain would function perfectly well if you'd let me use it, Poole \par
grumbled silently. But at least we seem to be getting somewhere - finally.\par
\par
    'Mr Poole,' said Anderson, still speaking in that curious stilted voice, as \par
if venturing in a foreign language, 'you know, of course, that you were - \par
disabled - in a serious accident, while you were working outside Discovery.'\par
\par
    Poole nodded agreement.\par
\par
    'I'm beginning to suspect,' he said dryly, 'that "disabled" is a slight \par
understatement.'\par
\par
    Anderson relaxed visibly, and a slow smile spread across his face.\par
\par
    'You're quite correct. Tell me what you think happened.'\par
\par
    'Well, the best case scenario is that, after I became unconscious, Dave \par
Bowman rescued me and brought me back to the ship. How is Dave? No one will tell \par
me anything!'\par
\par
    'All in due course... and the worst case?'\par
\par
    It seemed to Frank Poole that a chill wind was blowing gently on the back of \par
his neck. The suspicion that had been slowly forming in his mind began to \par
solidify.\par
\par
    'That I died, but was brought back here - wherever "here" is - and you've \par
been able to revive me. Thank you...'\par
\par
    'Quite correct. And you're back on Earth. Well, very near it.'\par
\par
    What did he mean by 'very near it'? There was certainly a gravity field here \par
- so he was probably inside the slowly turning wheel of an orbiting space-\par
station. No matter: there was something much more important to think about.\par
\par
    Poole did some quick mental calculations. If Dave had put him in the \par
hibernaculum, revived the rest of the crew, and completed the mission to Jupiter \par
- why, he could have been 'dead' for as much as five years!\par
\par
    'Just what date is it?' he asked, as calmly as possible.\par
\par
    Professor and Matron exchanged glances. Again Poole felt that cold wind on \par
his neck.\par
\par
    'I must tell you, Mr Poole, that Bowman did not rescue you. He believed - \par
and we cannot blame him - that you were irrevocably dead. Also, he was facing a \par
desperately serious crisis that threatened his own survival...'\par
\par
    'So you drifted on into space, passed through the Jupiter system, and headed \par
out towards the stars. Fortunately, you were so far below freezing point that \par
there was no metabolism - but it's a near-miracle that you were ever found at \par
all. You are one of the luckiest men alive. No - ever to have lived!'\par
\par
    Am I? Poole asked himself bleakly. Five years, indeed! It could be a century \par
- or even more.\par
\par
    'Let me have it,' he demanded.\par
\par
    Professor and Matron seemed to be consulting an invisible monitor: when they \par
looked at each other and nodded agreement, Poole guessed that they were all \par
plugged into the hospital information circuit, linked to the headband he was \par
wearing.\par
\par
    'Frank,' said Professor Anderson, making a smooth switch to the role of \par
long-time family physician, 'this will be a great shock to you, but you're \par
capable of accepting it - and the sooner you know, the better.'\par
\par
    'We're near the beginning of the Fourth Millennium. Believe me - you left \par
Earth almost a thousand years ago.'\par
\par
    'I believe you,' Poole answered calmly. Then, to his great annoyance, the \par
room started to spin around him, and he knew nothing more.\par
\par
    \par
\par
    When he regained consciousness, he found that he was no longer in a bleak \par
hospital room but in a luxurious suite with attractive - and steadily changing - \par
images on the walls. Some of these were famous and familiar paintings, others \par
showed land and sea-scapes that might have been from his own time. There was \par
nothing alien or upsetting: that, he guessed, would come later.\par
\par
    His present surroundings had obviously been carefully programmed: he \par
wondered if there was the equivalent of a television screen somewhere (how many \par
channels would the Fourth Millennium have?) but could see no sign of any \par
controls near his bed. There was so much he would have to learn in this new \par
world: he was a savage who had suddenly encountered civilization.\par
\par
    But first, he must regain his strength - and learn the language; not even \par
the advent of sound recording, already more than a century old when Poole was \par
born, had prevented major changes in grammar and pronunciation. And there were \par
thousands of new words, mostly from science and technology, though often he was \par
able to make a shrewd guess at their meaning.\par
\par
    More frustrating, however, were the myriad of famous and infamous personal \par
names that had accumulated over the millennium, and which meant nothing to him. \par
For weeks, until he had built up a data bank, most of his conversations had to \par
be interrupted with potted biographies. As Poole's strength increased, so did \par
the number of his visitors, though always under Professor Anderson's watchful \par
eye. They included medical specialists, scholars of several disciplines, and - \par
of the greatest interest to him - spacecraft commanders.\par
\par
    There was little that he could tell the doctors and historians that was not \par
recorded somewhere in Mankind's gigantic data banks, but he was often able to \par
give them research shortcuts and new insights about the events of his own time. \par
Though they all treated him with the utmost respect and listened patiently as he \par
tried to answer their questions, they seemed reluctant to answer his. Poole \par
began to feel that he was being over-protected from culture shock, and half-\par
seriously wondered how he could escape from his suite. On the few occasions he \par
was alone, he was not surprised to discover that the door was locked.\par
\par
    Then the arrival of Doctor Indra Wallace changed everything. Despite her \par
name, her chief racial component appeared to be Japanese, and there were times \par
when with just a little imagination Poole could picture her as a rather mature \par
Geisha Girl. It was hardly an appropriate image for a distinguished historian, \par
holding a Virtual Chair at a university still boasting real ivy.\par
\par
    She was the first visitor with a fluent command of Poole's own English, so \par
he was delighted to meet her.\par
\par
    'Mr Poole,' she began, in a very business-like voice, 'I've been appointed \par
your official guide and - let's say - mentor. My qualifications - I've \par
specialized in your period - my thesis was "The Collapse of the Nation-State, \par
2000-50". 1 believe we can help each other in many ways.'\par
\par
    'I'm sure we can. First I'd like you to get me out of here, so I can see a \par
little of your world.'\par
\par
    'Exactly what we intend to do. But first we must give you an Ident. Until \par
then you'll be - what was the term? -a non-person. It would be almost impossible \par
for you to go anywhere, or get anything done. No input device would recognize \par
your existence.'\par
\par
    'Just what I expected,' Poole answered, with a wry smile. 'It was starting \par
to get that way in my own time - and many people hated the idea.'\par
\par
    'Some still do. They go off and live in the wilderness - there's a lot more \par
on Earth than there was in your century! But they always take their compaks with \par
them, so they can call for help as soon as they get into trouble. The median \par
time is about five days.'\par
\par
    'Sorry to hear that. The human race has obviously deteriorated.'\par
\par
    He was cautiously testing her, trying to find the limits of her tolerance \par
and to map out her personality. It was obvious that they were going to spend \par
much time together, and that he would have to depend upon her in hundreds of \par
ways. Yet he was still not sure if he would even like her: perhaps she regarded \par
him merely as a fascinating museum exhibit.\par
\par
    Rather to Poole's surprise, she agreed with his criticism.\par
\par
    'That may be true - in some respects. Perhaps we're physically weaker, but \par
we're healthier and better adjusted than most humans who have ever lived. The \par
Noble Savage was always a myth'.\par
\par
    She walked over to a small rectangular plate, set at eye-level in the door. \par
It was about the size of one of the countless magazines that had proliferated in \par
the far-off Age of Print, and Poole had noticed that every room seemed to have \par
at least one. Usually they were blank, but sometimes they contained lines of \par
slowly scrolling text, completely meaningless to Poole even when most of the \par
words were familiar. Once a plate in his suite had emitted urgent beepings, \par
which he had ignored on the assumption that someone else would deal with the \par
problem, whatever it was. Fortunately the noise stopped as abruptly as it had \par
started.\par
\par
    Dr Wallace laid the palm of her hand upon the plate, then removed it after a \par
few seconds. She glanced at Poole, and said smilingly: 'Come and look at this.'\par
\par
    The inscription that had suddenly appeared made a good deal of sense, when \par
he read it slowly:WALLACE, INDRA [F2970.03.11 :31.885 / /HIST.OXFORD] 'I suppose \par
it means Female, date of birth 11 March 2970 - and that you're associated with \par
the Department of History at Oxford. And I guess that 31.885 is a personal \par
identification number. Correct?'\par
\par
    'Excellent, Mr Poole. I've seen some of your e-mail addresses and credit \par
card numbers - hideous strings of alpha-numeric gibberish that no one could \par
possibly remember! But we all know our date of birth, and not more than 99,999 \par
other people will share it. So a five-figure number is all you'll ever need... \par
and even if you forget that, it doesn't really matter. As you see, it's a part \par
of you.'\par
\par
    'Implant?'\par
\par
    'Yes - nanochip at birth, one in each palm for redundancy. You won't even \par
feel yours when it goes in. But you've given us a small problem...'\par
\par
    'What's that?'\par
\par
    'The readers you'll meet most of the time are too simple-minded to believe \par
your date of birth. So, with your permission, we've moved it up a thousand \par
years.'\par
\par
    'Permission granted. And the rest of the Ident?'\par
\par
    'Optional. You can leave it empty, give your current interests and location \par
- or use it for personal messages, global or targeted.'\par
\par
    Some things, Poole was quite sure, would not have changed over the \par
centuries. A high proportion of those 'targeted' messages would be very personal \par
indeed.\par
\par
    He wondered if there were still self or state-appointed censors in this day \par
and age - and if their efforts at improving other people's morals had been more \par
successful than in his own time.\par
\par
    He would have to ask Dr Wallace about that, when he got to know her better.\par
\par
    \par
\par

A Room with a View\par
\par
    \par
\par
    'Frank - Professor Anderson thinks you're strong enough to go for a little \par
walk.'\par
\par
    'I'm very pleased to hear it. Do you know the expression "stir crazy"?'\par
\par
    'No - but I can guess what it means.'\par
\par
    Poole had so adapted to the low gravity that the long strides he was taking \par
seemed perfectly normal. Half a gee, he had estimated - just right to give a \par
sense of well-being. They met only a few people on their walk, all of them \par
strangers, but every one gave a smile of recognition. By now, Poole told himself \par
with a trace of smugness, I must be one of the best-known celebrities in this \par
world. That should be a great help - when I decide what to do with the rest of \par
my life. At least another century, if I can believe Anderson.\par
\par
    The corridor along which they were walking was completely featureless apart \par
from occasional numbered doors, each bearing one of the universal recog panels. \par
Poole had followed Indra for perhaps two hundred metres when he came to a sudden \par
halt, shocked because he had not realized something so blindingly obvious.\par
\par
    'This space-station must be enormous!' he exclaimed. Indra smiled back at \par
him.\par
\par
    'Didn't you have a saying - "You ain't seen anything yet"?'\par
\par
    '"Nothing",' he corrected, absent-mindedly. He was still trying to estimate \par
the scale of this structure when he had another surprise. Who would have \par
imagined a space-station large enough to boast a subway - admittedly a miniature \par
one, with a single small coach capable of seating only a dozen passengers.\par
\par
    'Observation Lounge Three,' ordered Indra, and they drew silently and \par
swiftly away from the terminal.\par
\par
    Poole checked the time on the elaborate wrist-band whose functions he was \par
still exploring. One minor surprise had been that the whole world was now on \par
Universal Time: the confusing patchwork of Time Zones had been swept away by the \par
advent of global communications There had been much talk of this, back in the \par
twenty-first century, and it had even been suggested that Solar should be \par
replaced by Sidereal Time. Then, during the course of the year, the Sun would \par
move right round the clock: setting at the time it had risen six months earlier.\par
\par
    However, nothing had come of this 'Equal time in the Sun' proposal - or of \par
even more vociferous attempts to reform the calendar. That particular job, it \par
had been cynically suggested, would have to wait for somewhat major advances in \par
technology. Some day, surely, one of God's minor mistakes would be corrected, \par
and the Earth's orbit would be adjusted, to give every year twelve months of \par
thirty exactly equal days.\par
\par
    As far as Poole could judge by speed and elapsed time, they must have \par
travelled at least three kilometres before the vehicle came to a silent stop, \par
the doors opened, and a bland autovoice intoned, 'Have a good view. Thirty-five \par
per cent cloud-cover today.'\par
\par
    At last, thought Poole, we're getting near the outer wall. But here was \par
another mystery - despite the distance he had gone, neither the strength nor the \par
direction of gravity had altered! He could not imagine a spinning space-station \par
so huge that the gee-vector would not be changed by such a displacement... could \par
he really be on some planet after all? But he would feel lighter - usually much \par
lighter - on any other habitable world in the Solar System.\par
\par
    When the outer door of the terminal opened, and Poole found himself entering \par
a small airlock, he realized that he must indeed be in space. But where were the \par
spacesuits? He looked around anxiously: it was against all his instincts to be \par
so close to vacuum, naked and unprotected. One experience of that was enough...\par
\par
    'We're nearly there,' said Indra reassuringly.\par
\par
    The last door opened, and he was looking out into the utter blackness of \par
space, through a huge window that was curved both vertically and horizontally. \par
He felt like a goldfish in its bowl, and hoped that the designers of this \par
audacious piece of engineering knew exactly what they were doing. They certainly \par
possessed better structural materials than had existed in his time.\par
\par
    Though the stars must be shining out there, his light-adapted eyes could see \par
nothing but black emptiness beyond the curve of the great window. As he started \par
to walk towards it to get a wider view, Indra restrained him and pointed \par
straight ahead.\par
\par
    'Look carefully,' she said 'Don't you see it-'\par
\par
    Poole blinked, and stared into the night. Surely it must be an illusion - \par
even, heaven forbid, a crack in the window...\par
\par
    He moved his head from side to side. No, it was real. But what could it be? \par
He remembered Euclid's definition 'A lie has length, but no thickness'.\par
\par
    For spanning the whole height of the window, and obviously continuing out of \par
sight above and below, was a thread of light quite easy to see when he looked \par
for it, yet so one-dimensional that the word 'thin' could not even be applied. \par
However, it was not completely featureless; there were barely visible spots of \par
greater brilliance at irregular intervals along its length, like drops of water \par
on a spider's web.\par
\par
    Poole continued walking towards the window, and the view expanded until at \par
last he could see what lay below him. It was familiar enough: the whole \par
continent of Europe, and much of northern Africa, just as he had seen them many \par
times from space. So he was in orbit after all - probably an equatorial one, at \par
a height of at least a thousand kilometres.\par
\par
    Indra was looking at him with a quizzical smile.\par
\par
    'Go closer to the window,' she said, very softly. 'So that you can look \par
straight down. I hope you have a good head for heights.'\par
\par
    What a silly thing to say to an astronaut! Poole told himself as he moved \par
forward. If I ever suffered from vertigo, I wouldn't be in this business...\par
\par
    The thought had barely passed through his mind when he cried 'My God!' and \par
involuntarily stepped back from the window, Then, bracing himself, he dared to \par
look again.\par
\par
    He was looking down on the distant Mediterranean from the face of a \par
cylindrical tower, whose gently curving wall indicated a diameter of several \par
kilometres. But that was nothing compared with its length, for it tapered away \par
down, down, down - until it disappeared into the mist somewhere over Africa. He \par
assumed that it continued all the way to the surface.\par
\par
    'How high are we?' he whispered.\par
\par
    'Two thousand kay. But now look upwards.'\par
\par
    This time, it was not such a shock: he had expected what he would see. The \par
tower dwindled away until it became a glittering thread against the blackness of \par
space, and he did not doubt that it continued all the way to the geostationary \par
orbit, thirty-six thousand kilometres above the Equator. Such fantasies had been \par
well known in Poole's day: he had never dreamed he would see the reality - and \par
be living in it.\par
\par
    He pointed towards the distant thread reaching up from the eastern horizon.\par
\par
    'That must be another one.'\par
\par
    'Yes - the Asian Tower. We must look exactly the same to them.'\par
\par
    'How many are there?'\par
\par
    'Just four, equally spaced around the Equator. Africa, Asia, America, \par
Pacifica. The last one's almost empty - only a few hundred levels completed. \par
Nothing to see except water...'\par
\par
    Poole was still absorbing this stupendous concept when a disturbing thought \par
occurred to him.\par
\par
    'There were already thousands of satellites, at all sorts of altitudes, in \par
my time. How do you avoid collisions?'\par
\par
    Indra looked slightly embarrassed.\par
\par
    'You know - I never thought about that - it's not my field.' She paused for \par
a moment, clearly searching her memory. Then her face brightened.\par
\par
    'I believe there was a big clean-up operation, centuries ago. There just \par
aren't any satellites, below the stationary orbit.'\par
\par
    That made sense, Poole told himself. They wouldn't be needed - the four \par
gigantic towers could provide all the facilities once provided by thousands of \par
satellites and space-stations.\par
\par
    'And there have never been any accidents - any collisions with spaceships \par
leaving earth, or re-entering the atmosphere?'\par
\par
    Indra looked at him with surprise.\par
\par
    'But they don't, any more,' She pointed to the ceiling. 'All the spaceports \par
are where they should be - up there, on the outer ring. I believe it's four \par
hundred years since the last rocket lifted off from the surface of the Earth.'\par
\par
    Poole was still digesting this when a trivial anomaly caught his attention. \par
His training as an astronaut had made him alert to anything out of the ordinary: \par
in space, that might be a matter of life or death.\par
\par
    The Sun was out of view, high overhead, but its rays streaming down through \par
the great window painted a brilliant band of light on the floor underfoot. \par
Cutting across that band at an angle was another, much fainter one, so that the \par
frame of the window threw a double shadow.\par
\par
    Poole had to go almost down on his knees so that he could peer up at the \par
sky. He had thought himself beyond surprise, but the spectacle of two suns left \par
him momentarily speechless.\par
\par
    'What's that?' he gasped, when he had recovered his breath.\par
\par
    'Oh - haven't you been told? That's Lucifer.'\par
\par
    'Earth has another sun?'\par
\par
    'Well, it doesn't give us much heat, but it's put the Moon out of \par
business... Before the Second Mission went there to look for you, that was the \par
planet Jupiter.'\par
\par
    I knew I would have much to learn in this new world, Poole told himself. But \par
just how much, I never dreamed.\par
\par
    \par
\par
5\par
Education\par
\par
    \par
\par
    Poole was both astonished and delighted when the television set was wheeled \par
into the room and positioned at the end of his bed. Delighted because he was \par
suffering from mild information starvation - and astonished because it was a \par
model which had been obsolete even in his own time.\par
\par
    'We've had to promise the Museum we'll give it back,' Matron informed him. \par
'And I expect you know how to use this,'\par
\par
    As he fondled the remote-control, Poole felt a wave of acute nostalgia sweep \par
over him. As few other artefacts could, it brought back memories of his \par
childhood, and the days when most television sets were too stupid to understand \par
spoken commands.\par
\par
    'Thank you, Matron. What's the best news channel?'\par
\par
    She seemed puzzled by his question, then brightened.\par
\par
    'Oh - I see what you mean. But Professor Anderson thinks you're not quite \par
ready yet. So Archives has put together a collection that will make you feel at \par
home.'\par
\par
    Poole wondered briefly what the storage medium was in this day and age. He \par
could still remember compact disks, and his eccentric old Uncle George had been \par
the proud possessor of a collection of vintage videotapes. But surely that \par
technological contest must have finished centuries ago - in the usual Darwinian \par
way, with the survival of the fittest.\par
\par
    He had to admit that the selection was well done, by someone (Indra?) \par
familiar with the early twenty-first century. There was nothing disturbing - no \par
wars or violence, and very little contemporary business or politics, all of \par
which would now be utterly irrelevant. There were some light comedies, sporting \par
events (how did they know that he had been a keen tennis fan?), classical and \par
pop music, and wildlife documentaries.\par
\par
    And whoever had put this collection together had a sense of humour, or they \par
would not have included episodes from each Star Trek series. As a very small \par
boy, Poole had met both Patrick Stewart and Leonard Nimoy: he wondered what they \par
would have thought if they could have known the destiny of the child who had \par
shyly asked for their autographs.\par
\par
    A depressing thought occurred to him, soon after he had started exploring - \par
much of the time in fast-forward - these relics of the past. He had read \par
somewhere that by the turn of the century - his century! - there were \par
approximately fifty thousand television stations broadcasting simultaneously. If \par
that figure had been maintained and it might well have increased - by now \par
millions of millions of hours of TV programming must have gone on the air. So \par
even the most hardened cynic would admit that there were probably at least a \par
billion hours of worthwhile viewing... and millions that would pass the highest \par
standards of excellence. How to find these few - well, few million - needles in \par
so gigantic a haystack?\par
\par
    The thought was so overwhelming - indeed, so demoralizing - that after a \par
week of increasingly aimless channel-surfing Poole asked for the set to be \par
removed.\par
\par
    Perhaps fortunately, he had less and less time to himself during his waking \par
hours, which were steadily growing longer as his strength came back.\par
\par
    There was no risk of boredom, thanks to the continual parade not only of \par
serious researchers but also inquisitive - and presumably influential - citizens \par
who had managed to filter past the palace guard established by Matron and \par
Professor Anderson. Nevertheless, he was glad when, one day, the television set \par
reappeared, he was beginning to suffer from withdrawal symptoms - and this time, \par
he resolved to be more selective in his viewing.\par
\par
    The venerable antique was accompanied by Indra Wallace, smiling broadly.\par
\par
    'We've found something you must see, Frank. We think it will help you to \par
adjust - anyway, we're sure you'll enjoy it.'\par
\par
    Poole had always found that remark a recipe for guaranteed boredom, and \par
prepared for the worst. But the opening had him instantly hooked, taking him \par
back to his old life as few other things could have done. At once he recognized \par
one of the most famous voices of his age, and remembered that he had seen this \par
very programme before. Could it have been at its first transmission? No, he was \par
only five then: must have been a repeat...\par
\par
    'Atlanta, 2000 December 31.'\par
\par
    'This is CNN International, five minutes from the dawn of the New \par
Millennium, with all its unknown perils and promise...'\par
\par
    'But before we try to explore the future, let's look back a thousand years, \par
and ask ourselves: could any persons living in Ad. 1000 even remotely imagine \par
our world, or understand it, if they were magically transported across the \par
centuries?'\par
\par
    'Almost the whole of the technology we take for granted was invented near \par
the very end of our Millennium - the steam engine, electricity, telephones, \par
radio, television, cinema, aviation, electronics. And, during a single lifetime, \par
nuclear energy and space travel - what would the greatest minds of the past have \par
made of these? How long could an Archimedes or a Leonardo have retained his \par
sanity, if suddenly dumped into our world?'\par
\par
    'It's tempting to think that we would do better, if we were transported a \par
thousand years hence. Surely the fundamental scientific discoveries have already \par
been made, though there will be major improvements in technology, will there be \par
any devices, anything as magical and incomprehensible to us as a pocket \par
calculator or a video camera would have been to Isaac Newton?'\par
\par
    'Perhaps our age is indeed sundered from all those that have gone before. \par
Telecommunications, the ability to record images and sounds once irrevocably \par
lost, the conquest of the air and space - all these have created a civilization \par
beyond the wildest fantasies of the past. And equally important, Copernicus, \par
Newton, Darwin and Einstein have so changed our mode of thinking and our outlook \par
on the universe that we might seem almost a new species to the most brilliant of \par
our predecessors.'\par
\par
    'And will our successors, a thousand years from now, look back on us with \par
the same pity with which we regard our ignorant, superstitious, disease-ridden, \par
short-lived ancestors? We believe that we know the answers to questions that \par
they could not even ask: but what surprises does the Third Millennium hold for \par
us?'\par
\par
    'Well, here it comes -'\par
\par
    A great bell began to toll the strokes of midnight. The last vibration \par
throbbed into silence...\par
\par
    'And that's the way it was - good-bye, wonderful and terrible twentieth \par
century...'\par
\par
    Then the picture broke into a myriad fragments, and a new commentator took \par
over, speaking with the accent which Poole could now easily understand, and \par
which immediately brought him up to the present.\par
\par
    'Now, in the first minutes of the year three thousand and one, we can answer \par
that question from the past...'\par
\par
    'Certainly, the people of 2001 who you were just watching would not feel as \par
utterly overwhelmed in our age as someone from 1001 would have felt in theirs. \par
Many of our technological achievements they would have anticipated; indeed, they \par
would have expected satellite cities, and colonies on the Moon and planets. They \par
might even have been disappointed, because we are not yet immortal, and have \par
sent probes only to the nearest stars...'\par
\par
    Abruptly, Indra switched off the recording.\par
\par
    'See the rest later, Frank: you're getting tired. But I hope it will help \par
you to adjust.'\par
\par
    'Thank you, Indra. I'll have to sleep on it. But it's certainly proved one \par
point.'\par
\par
    'What's that?'\par
\par
    'I should be grateful I'm not a thousand-and-oner, dropped into 2001. That \par
would be too much of a quantum jump: I don't believe anyone could adjust to it. \par
At least I know about electricity, and won't die of fright if a picture starts \par
talking at me.'\par
\par
    I hope, Poole told himself, that confidence is justified. Someone once said \par
that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Will \par
I meet magic in this new world - and be able to handle it?\par
\par
    \par
\par
6\par
Braincap\par
\par
    \par
\par
    'I'm afraid you'll have to make an agonizing decision,' said Professor \par
Anderson, with a smile that neutralized the exaggerated gravity of his words.\par
\par
    'I can take it, Doctor. Just give it to me straight.'\par
\par
    'Before you can be fitted with your Braincap, you have to be completely \par
bald. So here's your choice. At the rate your hair grows, you'd have to be \par
shaved at least once a month. Or you could have a permanent.'\par
\par
    'How's that done?'\par
\par
    'Laser scalp treatment. Kills the follicles at the root.'\par
\par
    'Hmm... is it reversible?'\par
\par
    'Yes, but that's messy and painful, and takes weeks.'\par
\par
     'Then I'll see how I like being hairless, before committing myself. I can't \par
forget what happened to Samson.'\par
\par
    'Who?'\par
\par
    'Character in a famous old book. His girl-friend cut off his hair while he \par
was sleeping. When he woke up, all his strength had gone.'\par
\par
    'Now I remember - pretty obvious medical symbolism!'\par
\par
    'Still, I wouldn't mind losing my beard. I'd be happy to stop shaving, once \par
and for all.'\par
\par
    'I'll make the arrangements. And what kind of wig would you like?'\par
\par
    Poole laughed.\par
\par
    'I'm not particularly vain - think it would be a nuisance, and probably \par
won't bother. Something else I can decide later.'\par
\par
    That everyone in this era was artificially bald was a surprising fact that \par
Poole had been quite slow to discover; his first revelation had come when both \par
his nurses removed their luxuriant tresses, without the slightest sign of \par
embarrassment, just before several equally bald specialists arrived to give him \par
a series of micro-biological checks. He had never been surrounded by so many \par
hairless people, and his initial guess was that this was the latest step in the \par
medical profession's endless war against germs.\par
\par
    Like many of his guesses, it was completely wrong, and when he discovered \par
the true reason he amused himself by seeing how often he would have been sure, \par
had he not known in advance, that his visitors' hair was not their own. The \par
answer was: seldom with men, never with women; this was obviously the great age \par
of the wig-maker.\par
\par
    Professor Anderson wasted no time: that afternoon the nurses smeared some \par
evil-smelling cream over Poole's head, and when he looked into the mirror an \par
hour later he did not recognize himself. Well, he thought, perhaps a wig would \par
be a good idea, after all...\par
\par
    The Braincap fitting took somewhat longer. First a mould had to be made, \par
which required him to sit motionless for a few minutes until the plaster set. He \par
fully expected to be told that his head was the wrong shape when his nurses - \par
giggling most unprofessionally - had a hard time extricating him. 'Ouch that \par
hurt!' he complained.\par
\par
    Next came the skull-cap itself, a metal helmet that fitted snugly almost \par
down to the ears, and triggered a nostalgic thought - wish my Jewish friends \par
could see me now! After a few minutes, it was so comfortable that he was unaware \par
of its presence.\par
\par
    Now he was ready for the installation - a process which, he realized with \par
something akin to awe, had been the Rite of Passage for almost all the human \par
race for more than half a millennium.\par
\par
    'There's no need to close your eyes,' said the technician, who had been \par
introduced by the pretentious title of 'Brain Engineer' - almost always \par
shortened to 'Brainman' in popular usage. 'When Setup begins, all your inputs \par
will be taken over. Even if your eyes are open, you won't see anything.'\par
\par
    I wonder if everyone feels as nervous as this, Poole asked himself. Is this \par
the last moment I'll be in control of my own mind? Still, I've learned to trust \par
the technology of this age; up to now, it hasn't let me down. Of course, as the \par
old saying goes, there's always a first time...\par
\par
    As he had been promised, he had felt nothing except a gentle tickling as the \par
myriad of nanowires wormed their way through his scalp. All his senses were \par
still perfectly normal; when he scanned his familiar room, everything was \par
exactly where it should be.\par
\par
    The Brainman - wearing his own skull-cap, wired, like Poole's, to a piece of \par
equipment that could easily have been mistaken for a twentieth-century laptop \par
computer - gave him a reassuring smile.\par
\par
    'Ready?' he asked.\par
\par
    There were times when the old cliche\'b4s were the best ones.\par
\par
    'Ready as I'll ever be,' Poole answered.\par
\par
    Slowly, the light faded - or seemed to. A great silence descended, and even \par
the gentle gravity of the Tower relinquished its hold upon him. He was an \par
embryo, floating in a featureless void, though not in complete darkness. He had \par
known such a barely visible, near ultra-violet tenebrosity, on the very edge of \par
night, only once in his life when he had descended further than was altogether \par
wise down the face of a sheer cliff at the outer edge of the Great Barrier Reef. \par
Looking down into hundreds of metres of crystalline emptiness, he had felt such \par
a sense of disorientation that he experienced a brief moment of panic, and had \par
almost triggered his buoyancy unit before regaining control. Needless to say, he \par
had never mentioned the incident to the Space Agency physicians...\par
\par
    From a great distance a voice spoke out of the immense void that now seemed \par
to surround him. But it did not reach him through his ears: it sounded softly in \par
the echoing labyrinths of his brain.\par
\par
    'Calibration starting. From time to time you will be asked questions - you \par
can answer mentally, but it may help to vocalize. Do you understand?'\par
\par
    'Yes,' Poole replied, wondering if his lips were indeed moving. There was no \par
way that he could tell.\par
\par
    Something was appearing in the void - a grid of thin lines, like a huge \par
sheet of graph paper. It extended up and down, right and left, to the limits of \par
his vision. He tried to move his head, but the image refused to change.\par
\par
    Numbers started to flicker across the grid, too fast for him to read - but \par
presumably some circuit was recording them. Poole could not help smiling (did \par
his cheeks move?) at the familiarity of it all. This was just like the computer-\par
driven eye examination that any oculist of his age would give a client.\par
\par
    The grid vanished, to be replaced by smooth sheets of colour filling his \par
entire field of view. In a few seconds, they flashed from one end of the \par
spectrum to the other. 'Could have told you that,' Poole muttered silently. 'My \par
colour vision's perfect. Next for hearing, I suppose.'\par
\par
    He was quite correct. A faint, drumming sound accelerated until it became \par
the lowest of audible Cs, then raced up the musical scale until it disappeared \par
beyond the range of human hearing, into bat and dolphin territory.\par
\par
    That was the last of the simple, straightforward tests. He was briefly \par
assailed by scents and flavours, most of them pleasant but some quite the \par
reverse. Then he became, or so it seemed, a puppet on an invisible strig.\par
\par
    He presumed that his neuromuscular control was being tested, and hoped that \par
there were no external manifestations, if there were, he would probably look \par
like someone in the terminal stages of St Vitus's Dance. And for one moment he \par
even had a violent erection, but was unable to give it a reality check before he \par
fell into a dreamless sleep.\par
\par
    Or did he only dream that he slept? He had no idea how much time had elapsed \par
before he awoke. The helmet had already gone, together with the Brainman and his \par
equipment.\par
\par
    'Everything went fine,' beamed Matron. 'It will take a few hours to check \par
that there are no anomalies. If your reading's KO - I mean OK - you'll have your \par
Braincap tomorrow.'\par
\par
    Poole appreciated the efforts of his entourage to learn archaic English, but \par
he could not help wishing that Matron had not made that unfortunate slip-of-the-\par
tongue.\par
\par
    When the time came for the final filling, Poole felt almost like a boy \par
again, about to unwrap some wonderful new toy under the Christmas free.\par
\par
    'You won't have to go through all that setting-up again,' the Brainman \par
assured him. 'Download will start immediately. I'll give you a five-minute demo. \par
Just relax and enjoy.'\par
\par
    Gentle, soothing music washed over him; though it was something very \par
familiar, from his own time, he could not identify it. There was a mist before \par
his eyes, which parted as he walked towards it...\par
\par
    Yes, he was walking! The illusion was utterly convincing; he could feel the \par
impact of his feet on the ground, and now that the music had stopped he could \par
hear a gentle wind blowing through the great trees that appeared to surround \par
him. He recognized them as Californian redwoods, and hoped that they still \par
existed in reality, somewhere on Earth.\par
\par
    He was moving at a brisk pace - too fast for comfort, as if time was \par
slightly accelerated so he could cover as much ground as possible. Yet he was \par
not conscious of any effort; he felt he was a guest in someone else's body. The \par
sensation was enhanced by the fact that he had no control over his movements. \par
When he attempted to stop, or to change direction, nothing happened. He was \par
going along for the ride.\par
\par
    It did not matter; he was enjoying the novel experience - and could \par
appreciate how addictive it could become. The 'dream machines' that many \par
scientists of his own century had anticipated - often with alarm - were now part \par
of everyday life. Poole wondered how Mankind had managed to survive: he had been \par
told that much of it had not. Millions had been brain-burned, and had dropped \par
out of life.\par
\par
     Of course, he would be immune to such temptations! He would use this \par
marvellous tool to learn more about the world of the Fourth Millennium, and to \par
acquire in minutes new skills that would otherwise take years to master. Well - \par
he might, just occasionally, use the Braincap purely for fun...\par
\par
     He had come to the edge of the forest, and was looking out across a wide \par
river. Without hesitation, he walked into it, and felt no alarm as the water \par
rose over his head. It did seem a little strange that he could continue \par
breathing naturally, but he thought it much more remarkable that he could see \par
perfectly in a medium where the unaided human eye could not focus. He could \par
count every scale on the magnificent trout that went swimming past, apparently \par
oblivious to this strange intruder...\par
\par
    Then, a mermaid- Well he had always wanted to meet one, but he had assumed \par
that they were marine creatures. Perhaps they occasionally came upstream - like \par
salmon, to have their babies? She was gone before he could question her, to \par
confirm or deny this revolutionary theory.\par
\par
    The river ended in a translucent wall; he stepped through it on to the face \par
of a desert, beneath a blazing sun. Its heat burned him uncomfortably - yet he \par
was able to look directly into its noonday fury. He could even see, with \par
unnatural clarity, an archipelago of sunspots near one limb. And - this was \par
surely impossible - there was the tenuous glory of the corona, quite invisible \par
except during total eclipse, reaching out like a swan's wings on either side of \par
the Sun.\par
\par
    Everything faded to black: the haunting music returned, and with it the \par
blissful coolness of his familiar room. He opened his eyes (had they ever been \par
closed?) and found an expectant audience waiting for his reaction.\par
\par
    'Wonderful!' he breathed, almost reverently. 'Some of it seemed - well, \par
realer than real!'\par
\par
    Then his engineer's curiosity, never far from the surface, started nagging \par
him.\par
\par
    'Even that short demo must have contained an enormous amount of information. \par
How's it stored?'\par
\par
    'In these tablets - the same your audio-visual system uses, but with much \par
greater capacity.'\par
\par
    The Brainman handed Poole a small square, apparently made of glass, silvered \par
on one surface; it was almost the same size as the computer diskettes of his \par
youth, but twice the thickness. As Poole tilted it back and forth, trying to see \par
into its transparent interior, there were occasional rainbow-hued flashes, but \par
that was all.\par
\par
    He was holding, he realized, the end product of more than a thousand years \par
of electro-optical technology - as well as other technologies unborn in his era. \par
And it was not surprising that, superficially, it resembled closely the devices \par
he had known. There was a convenient shape and size for most of the common \par
objects of everyday life -knives and forks, books, hand-tools, furniture... and \par
removable memories for computers.\par
\par
    'What's its capacity?' he asked. 'In my time, we were up to a terabyte in \par
something this size. I'm sure you've done a lot better.'\par
\par
    'Not as much as you might imagine - there's a limit, of course, set by the \par
structure of matter. By the way, what was a terabyte? Afraid I've forgotten.'\par
\par
    'Shame on you! Kilo, mega, giga, tera... that's ten to the twelfth bytes. \par
Then the petabyte - ten to the fifteenth - that's as far as I ever got.'\par
\par
    'That's about where we start. It's enough to record everything any person \par
can experience during one lifetime.'\par
\par
    It was an astonishing thought, yet it should not have been so surprising. \par
The kilogram of jelly inside the human skull was not much larger than the tablet \par
Poole was holding in his hand, and it could not possibly be as efficient a \par
storage device - it had so many other duties to deal with.\par
\par
    'And that's not all,' the Brainman continued. 'With some data compression, \par
it could store not only the memories - but the actual person.'\par
\par
    'And reproduce them again?'\par
\par
    'Of course; straightforward job of nanoassembly.'\par
\par
    So I'd heard, Poole told himself - but I never really believed it.\par
\par
    Back in his century, it seemed wonderful enough that the entire lifework of \par
a great artist could be stored on a single small disk. And now, something no \par
larger could hold - the artist as well.\par
\par
    \par
\par
7\par
Debriefing\par
\par
    \par
\par
    'I'm delighted,' said Poole, 'to know that the Smithsonian still exists, \par
after all these centuries.'\par
\par
    'You probably wouldn't recognize it,' said the visitor who had introduced \par
himself as Dr Alistair Kim, Director of Astronautics. 'Especially as it's now \par
scattered over the Solar System - the main off-Earth collections are on Mars and \par
the Moon, and many of the exhibits that legally belong to us are still heading \par
for the stars. Some day we'll catch up with them and bring them home. We're \par
particularly anxious to get our hands on Pioneer 10 - the first manmade object \par
to escape from the Solar System.'\par
\par
    'I believe I was on the verge of doing that, when they located me.'\par
\par
    'Lucky for you - and for us. You may be able to throw light on many things \par
we don't know.'\par
\par
    'Frankly, I doubt it - but I'll do my best. I don't remember a thing after \par
that runaway space-pod charged me. Though I still find it hard to believe, I've \par
been told that Hal was responsible.'\par
\par
    'That's true, but it's a complicated story. Everything we've been able to \par
learn is in this recording - about twenty hours, but you can probably Fast most \par
of it.'\par
\par
    'You know, of course, that Dave Bowman went out in the Number 2 Pod to \par
rescue you - but was then locked outside the ship because Hal refused to open \par
the pod-bay doors.'\par
\par
    'Why, for God's sake?'\par
\par
    Dr Kim winced slightly. It was not the first time Poole had noticed such a \par
reaction.\par
\par
    (Must watch my language, he thought. 'God' seems to be a dirty word in this \par
culture - must ask Indra about it.)\par
\par
    'There was a major programming error in Hal's instructions - he'd been given \par
control of aspects of the mission you and Bowman didn't know about, it's all in \par
the recording...\par
\par
    'Anyway, he also cut off the life-support systems to the three hybernauts - \par
the Alpha Crew - and Bowman had to jettison their bodies as well.'\par
\par
    (So Dave and I were the Beta Crew - something else I didn't know...)\par
\par
    'What happened to them?' Poole asked. 'Couldn't they have been rescued, just \par
as I was?'\par
\par
    'I'm afraid not: we've looked into it, of course. Bowman ejected them \par
several hours after he'd taken back control from Hal, so their orbits were \par
slightly different from yours. Just enough for them to burn up in Jupiter - \par
while you skimmed by, and got a gravity boost that would have taken you to the \par
Orion Nebula in a few thousand more years...'\par
\par
    'Doing everything on manual override - really a fantastic performance! - \par
Bowman managed to get Discovery into orbit round Jupiter. And there he \par
encountered what the Second Expedition called Big Brother - an apparent twin of \par
the Tycho Monolith, but hundreds of times larger.'\par
\par
    'And that's where we lost him. He left Discovery in the remaining space-pod, \par
and made a rendezvous with Big Brother. For almost a thousand years, we've been \par
haunted by his last message: "By Deus - it's full of stars!"\par
\par
    (Here we go again! Poole told himself. No way Dave could have said that... \par
Must have been 'My God - it's full of stars!')\par
\par
    'Apparently the pod was drawn into the Monolith by some kind of inertial \par
field, because it - and presumably Bowman - survived an acceleration which \par
should have crushed them instantly. And that was the last information anyone \par
had, for almost ten years, until the joint US-Russian Leonov mission...'\par
\par
    'Which made a rendezvous with the abandoned Discovery so that Dr Chandra \par
could go aboard and reactivate Hal. Yes, I know that.'\par
\par
    Dr Kim looked slightly embarrassed.\par
\par
    'Sorry - I wasn't sure how much you'd been told already Anyway, that's when \par
even stranger things started to happen.'\par
\par
    'Apparently the arrival of Leonov triggered something inside Big Brother. If \par
we did not have these recordings, no one would have believed what happened. Let \par
me show you... here's Dr Heywood Floyd keeping the midnight watch aboard \par
Discovery, after power had been restored. Of course you'll recognize \par
everything.'\par
\par
    (Indeed I do: and how strange to see the long-dead Heywood Floyd, sitting in \par
my old seat with Hal's unblinking red eye surveying everything in sight. And \par
even stranger to think that Hal and I have both shared the same experience of \par
resurrection from the dead...)\par
\par
    A message was coining up on one of the monitors, and Floyd answered lazily, \par
'OK, Hal. Who is calling?'\par
\par
    NO IDENTIFICATION.\par
\par
    Floyd looked slightly annoyed.\par
\par
    'Very well. Please give me the message.'\par
\par
    IT IS DANGEROUS TO REMAIN HERE. YOU MUST LEAVE WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS.\par
\par
    'That is absolutely impossible. Our launch window does not open until \par
twenty-six days from now. We do not have sufficient propellant for an earlier \par
departure.'\par
\par
    I AM AWARE OF THESE FACTS. NEVERTHELESS YOU MUST LEAVE WITHIN FWFEEN DAYS.\par
\par
    'I cannot take this warning seriously unless I know its origin... who is \par
speaking to me?'\par
\par
    I WAS DAVID BOWMAN. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU BELIEVE ME. LOOK BEHIND YOU.\par
\par
    Heywood Floyd slowly turned in his swivel chair, away from the banked panels \par
and switches of the computer display, towards the Velcro-covered catwalk behind.\par
\par
    ('Watch this carefully,' said Dr Kim.\par
\par
    As if I needed telling, thought Poole...)\par
\par
    The zero-gravity environment of Discovery's observation deck was much \par
dustier than he remembered it: he guessed that the air-filtration plant had not \par
yet been brought on line. The parallel rays of the distant yet still brilliant \par
Sun, streaming through the great windows, lit up a myriad of dancing motes in a \par
classic display of Brownian movement.\par
\par
    And now something strange was happening to these particles of dust; some \par
force seemed to be marshalling them, herding them away from a central point yet \par
bringing others towards it, until they all met on the surface of a hollow \par
sphere. That sphere, about a metre across, hovered in the air for a moment like \par
a giant soap bubble. Then it elongated into an ellipsoid, whose surface began to \par
pucker, to form folds and indentations. Poole was not really surprised when it \par
started to assume the shape of a man.\par
\par
    He had seen such figures, blown out of glass, in museums and science \par
exibitions. But this dusty phantom did not even approximate anatomical accuracy; \par
it was like a crude clay figurine, or one of the primitive works of art found in \par
the recesses of Stone Age caves. Only the head was fashioned with care; and the \par
face, beyond all shadow of doubt, was that of Commander David Bowman.\par
\par
    HELLO, DR FLOYD. NOW DO YOU BELIEVE ME?\par
\par
    The lips of the figure never moved: Poole realized that the voice - yes, \par
certainly Bowman's voice - was actually coming from the speaker grille.\par
\par
    THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME, AND I HAVE LIITLE TIME. I HAVE BEEN ALLOWED \par
TO GIVE THIS WARNING. YOU HAVE ONLY FIFFEEN DAYS.\par
\par
    'Why - and what are you?'\par
\par
    But the ghostly figure was already fading, its grainy envelope beginning to \par
dissolve back into the constituent particles of dust.\par
\par
    GOOD-BYE, DOCTOR FLOYD. WE CAN HAVE NO FURTHER CONTACT. BUT THERE MAY BE ONE \par
MORE MESSAGE, IF ALL GOES WELL.\par
\par
    As the image dissolved, Poole could not help smiling at that old Space Age \par
cliche\'b4. 'If all goes well' - how many times he had heard that phrase intoned \par
before a mission!\par
\par
    The phantom vanished: only the motes of dancing dust were left, resuming \par
their random patterns in the air. With an effort of will, Poole came back to the \par
present.\par
\par
    'Well, Commander - what do you think of that?' asked Kim.\par
\par
    Poole was still shaken, and it was several seconds before he could reply.\par
\par
    'The face and the voice were Bowman's - I'd swear to that. But what was it?'\par
\par
    'That's what we're still arguing about. Call it a hologram, a projection - \par
of course, there are plenty of ways it could be faked if anyone wanted to - but \par
not in those circumstances! And then, of course, there's what happened next.'\par
\par
    'Lucifer?'\par
\par
    'Yes. Thanks to that warning, the Leonov had just sufficient time to get \par
away before Jupiter detonated.'\par
\par
    'So whatever it was, the Bowman-thing was friendly and trying to help.'\par
\par
    'Presumably. And it may have been responsible for that "one more message" we \par
did receive - it was sent only minutes before the detonation. Another waning.'\par
\par
    Dr Kim brought the screen to life once more. It showed plain text: ALL THESE \par
WORLDS ARE YOURS EXCEPT EUROPA. ATTEMPT NO LANDINGS THERE. The same message was \par
repeated about a hundred times, then the letters became garbled.\par
\par
    'And we never have tried to land there?' asked Poole.\par
\par
    'Only once, by accident, thirty-six years later - when the USSS Galaxy was \par
hijacked and forced down there, and her sister ship Universe had to go to the \par
rescue. It's all here -with what little our robot monitors have told us about \par
the Europans.'\par
\par
    'I'm anxious to see them.'\par
\par
    'They're amphibious, and come in all shapes and sizes. As soon as Lucifer \par
started melting the ice that covered theirt whole world, they began to emerge \par
from the sea. Since then, they've developed at a speed that seems biologically \par
impossible.'\par
\par
    'From what I remember about Europa, weren't there lots of cracks in the ice? \par
Perhaps they'd already started crawling through and having a look round.'\par
\par
    'That's a widely accepted theory. But there's another, much more \par
speculative, one. The Monolith may have been involved, in ways we don't yet \par
understand. What triggered that line of thought was the discovery of TMA ZERO, \par
right here on Earth, almost five hundred years after your time. I suppose you've \par
been told about that?'\par
\par
    'Only vaguely - there's been so much to catch up with! I did think the name \par
was ridiculous - since it wasn't a magnetic anomaly - and it was in Africa, not \par
Tycho!'\par
\par
    'You're quite right, of course, but we're stuck with the name. And the more \par
we learn about the Monoliths, the more the puzzle deepens. Especially as they're \par
still the only real evidence for advanced technology beyond the Earth.'\par
\par
    'That's surprised me. I should have thought that by this lime we'd have \par
picked up radio signals from somewhere. The astronomers started searching when I \par
was a boy!'\par
\par
    'Well, there is one hint - and it's so terrifying that we don't like to talk \par
about it. Have you heard of Nova Scorpio?'\par
\par
    'I don't believe so.'\par
\par
    'Stars go nova all the time, of course - and this wasn't a particularly \par
impressive one. But before it blew up, N Scorp was known to have several \par
planets.'\par
\par
    'Inhabited?'\par
\par
    'Absolutely no way of telling; radio searches had picked up nothing. And \par
here's the nightmare...'\par
\par
    'Luckily, the automatic Nova Patrol caught the event at the very beginning. \par
And it didn't start at the star. One of the planets detonated first, and then \par
triggered its sun.'\par
\par
    'My Gah... sorry, go on.'\par
\par
    'You see the point. It's impossible for a planet to go nova - except in one \par
way.'\par
\par
    'I once read a sick joke in a science-fiction novel - "supernovae are \par
industrial accidents".'\par
\par
    'It wasn't a supernova - but that may be no joke. The most widely accepted \par
theory is that someone else had been tapping vacuum energy - and had lost \par
control.'\par
\par
    'Or it could have been a war.'\par
\par
    'Just as bad; we'll probably never know. But as our own civilization depends \par
on the same energy source, you can understand why N Scorp sometimes gives us \par
nightmares.'\par
\par
    'And we only had melting nuclear reactors to worry about!'\par
\par
    'Not any longer, thank Deus. But I really wanted to tell you more about TMA \par
ZERO's discovery, because it marked a turning point in human history.'\par
\par
    'Finding TMA ONE on the Moon was a big enough shock, but five hundred years \par
later there was a worse one. And it was much nearer home - in every sense of the \par
word. Down there in Africa.'\par
\par
    \par
\par
8\par
Return to Olduvai\par
\par
    \par
\par
    The Leakeys, Dr Stephen Del Marco often told himself, would never have \par
recognized this place, even though it's barely a dozen kilometres from where \par
Louis and Mary, five centuries ago, dug up the bones of our first ancestors. \par
Global warming, and the Little Ice Age (truncated by miracles of heroic \par
technology) had transformed the landscape, and completely altered its biota. \par
Oaks and pine trees were still fighting it out, to see which would survive the \par
changes in climatic fortune.\par
\par
    And it was hard to believe that, by this year 2513, there was anything left \par
in Olduvai undug by enthusiastic anthropologists. However, recent flash-floods - \par
which were not supposed to happen any more - had resculpted this area, and cut \par
away several metres of topsoil. Del Marco had taken advantage of the \par
opportunity: and there, at the limit of the deep-scan, was something he could \par
not quite believe.\par
\par
    It had taken more than a year of slow and careful excavation to reach that \par
ghostly image, and to learn that the reality was stranger than anything he had \par
dared to imagine. Robot digging machines had swiftly removed the first few \par
metres, then the traditional slave-crews of graduate students had taken over. \par
They had been helped - or hindered - by a team of four kongs, who Del Marco \par
considered more trouble than they were worth. However, the students adored the \par
genetically-enhanced gorillas, whom they treated like retarded but much-loved \par
children. It was rumoured that the relationships were not always completely \par
Platonic.\par
\par
    For the last few metres, however, everything was the work of human hands, \par
usually wielding toothbrushes - soft-bristled at that. And now it was finished: \par
Howard Carter, seeing the first glint of gold in Tutankhamen's tomb, had never \par
uncovered such a treasure as this. From this moment onwards, Del Marco knew, \par
human beliefs and philosophies would be irrevocably changed.\par
\par
    The Monolith appeared to be the exact twin of that discovered on the Moon \par
five centuries earlier: even the excavation surrounding it was almost identical \par
in size. And like TMA ONE, it was totally non-reflective, absorbing with equal \par
indifference the fierce glare of the African Sun and the pale gleam of Lucifer.\par
\par
    As he led his colleagues - the directors of the world's half-dozen most \par
famous museums, three eminent anthropologists, the heads of two media empires - \par
down into the pit, Del Marco wondered if such a distinguished group of men and \par
women had ever been so silent, for so long. But that was the effect that this \par
ebon rectangle had on all visitors, as they realized the implications of the \par
thousands of artefacts that surrounded it.\par
\par
    For here was an archaeologist's treasure-trove - crudely-fashioned flint \par
tools, countless bones - some animal, some human - and almost all arranged in \par
careful patterns. For centuries - no, millennia - these pitiful gifts had been \par
brought here, by creatures with only the first glimmer of intelligence, as \par
tribute to a marvel beyond their understanding.\par
\par
    And beyond ours, Del Marco had often thought. Yet of two things he was \par
certain, though he doubted if proof would ever be possible.\par
\par
    This was where - in time and space - the human species had really begun.\par
\par
    And this Monolith was the very first of all its multitudinous gods.\par
\par
    \par

Skyland\par
\par
    \par
\par
    'There were mice in my bedroom last night,' Poole complained, only half \par
seriously. 'Is there any chance you could find me a cat?'\par
\par
    Dr Wallace looked puzzled, then started to laugh.\par
\par
    'You must have heard one of the cleaning microts - I'll get the programming \par
checked so they don't disturb you. Try not to step on one if you catch it at \par
work; if you do, it will call for help, and all its friends will come to pick up \par
the pieces.'\par
\par
    So much to learn - so little time! No, that wasn't true, Poole reminded \par
himself. He might well have a century ahead of him, thanks to the medical \par
science of this age. The thought was already beginning to fill him with \par
apprehension rather than pleasure.\par
\par
    At least he was now able to follow most conversations easily, and had \par
learned to pronounce words so that Indra was not the only person who could \par
understand him. He was very glad that Anglish was now the world language, though \par
French, Russian and Mandarin still flourished.\par
\par
    'I've another problem, Indra - and I guess you're the only person who can \par
help. When I say "God", why do people look embarrassed?'\par
\par
    Indra did not look at all embarrassed; in fact, she laughed.\par
\par
    'That's a very complicated story. I wish my old friend Dr Khan was here to \par
explain it to you - but he's on Ganymede, curing any remaining True Believers he \par
can find there. When all the old religions were discredited - let me tell you \par
about Pope Pius XX sometime - one of the greatest men in history! - we still \par
needed a word for the Prime Cause, or the Creator of the Universe - if there is \par
one...'\par
\par
    'There were lots of suggestions - Deo - Theo - Jove - Brahma - they were all \par
tried, and some of them are still around - especially Einstein's favourite, "The \par
Old One". But Deus seems to be the fashion nowadays.'\par
\par
    'I'll try to remember; but it still seems silly to me.'\par
\par
    'You'll get used to it: I'll teach you some other reasonably polite \par
expletives, to use when you want to express your feelings...'\par
\par
    'You said that all the old religions have been discredited. So what do \par
people believe nowadays?'\par
\par
    'As little as possible. We're all either Deists or Theists.'\par
\par
    'You've lost me. Definitions, please.'\par
\par
    'They were slightly different in your time, but here are the latest \par
versions. Theists believe there's not more than one God; Deists that there is \par
not less than one God.'\par
\par
    'I'm afraid the distinction's too subtle for me.'\par
\par
    'Not for everyone; you'd be amazed at the bitter controversies it's aroused. \par
Five centuries ago, someone used what's known as surreal mathematics to prove \par
there's an infinite number of grades between Theists and Deists. Of course, like \par
most dabblers with infinity, he went insane. By the way, the best-known Deists \par
were Americans - Washington, Franklin, Jefferson.'\par
\par
    'A little before my time - though you'd be surprised how many people don't \par
realize it.'\par
\par
    'Now I've some good news. Joe - Prof. Anderson - has finally given his - \par
what was the phrase? - OK. You're fit enough to go for a little trip upstairs... \par
to the Lunar Level.'\par
\par
    'Wonderful. How far is that?'\par
\par
    'Oh, about twelve thousand kilometres.'\par
\par
    'Twelve thousand! That will take hours!'\par
\par
    Indra looked surprised at his remark: then she smiled.\par
\par
    'Not as long as you think. No - we don't have a Star Trek Transporter yet - \par
though I believe they're still working on it! But you'll need new clothes, and \par
someone to show you how to wear them. And to help you with the hundreds of \par
little everyday jobs that can waste so much time. So we've taken the liberty of \par
arranging a human personal assistant for you Come in, Danil.'\par
\par
    Danil was a small, light-brown man in his mid-thirties, who surprised Poole \par
by not giving him the usual palm-top salute, with its automatic exchange of \par
information.\par
\par
    Indeed, it soon appeared that Danil did not possess an Ident: whenever it \par
was needed, he produced a small rectangle of plastic that apparently served the \par
same purpose as the twenty-first century's 'smart cards'.\par
\par
    'Danil will also be your guide and what was that word? - I can never \par
remember - rhymes with "ballet". He's been specially trained for the job. I'm \par
sure you'll find him completely satisfactory.'\par
\par
    Though Poole appreciated this gesture, it made him feel a little \par
uncomfortable. A valet, indeed! He could not recall ever meeting one; in his \par
time, they were already a rare and endangered species. He began to feel like a \par
character from an early-twentieth-century English novel.\par
\par
    'You have a choice,' said Indra, 'though I know which one you'll take. We \par
can go up on an external elevator, and admire the view - or an interior one, and \par
enjoy a meal and some light entertainment.'\par
\par
    'I can't imagine anyone wanting to stay inside.'\par
\par
    'You'd be surprised. It's too vertiginous for some people - especially \par
visitors from down below. Even mountain climbers who say they've got a head for \par
heights may start to turn green - when the heights are measured in thousands of \par
kilometres, instead of metres.'\par
\par
    'I'll risk it,' Poole answered with a smile. 'I've been higher.'\par
\par
    When they had passed through a double set of airlocks in the exterior wall \par
of the Tower (was it imagination, or did he feel a curious sense of \par
disorientation then?) they entered what might have been the auditorium of a very \par
small theatre. Rows of ten seats were banked up in five tiers: they all faced \par
towards one of the huge picture windows which Poole still found disconcerting, \par
as he could never quite forget the hundreds of tons of air pressure, striving to \par
blast it out into space.\par
\par
    The dozen or so other passengers, who had probably never given the matter \par
any thought, seemed perfectly at ease. They all smiled as they recognized him, \par
nodded politely, then turned away to admire the view.\par
\par
    'Welcome to Skylounge,' said the inevitable autovoice. 'Ascent begins in \par
five minutes. You will find refreshments and toilets on the lower floor.'\par
\par
    Just how long will this trip last? Poole wondered. We're going to travel \par
over twenty thousand klicks, there and back: this will be like no elevator ride \par
I've ever known on Earth...\par
\par
    While he was waiting for the ascent to begin, he enjoyed the stunning \par
panorama laid out two thousand kilometres below. It was winter in the northern \par
hemisphere, but the climate had indeed changed drastically, for there was little \par
snow south of the Arctic Circle.\par
\par
    Europe was almost cloud-free, and there was so much detail that the eye was \par
overwhelmed. One by one he identified the great cities whose names had echoed \par
down the centuries; they had been shrinking even in his time, as the \par
communications revolution changed the face of the world, and had now dwindled \par
still further. There were also some bodies of water in improbable places - the \par
northern Sahara's Lake Saladin was almost a small sea.\par
\par
    Poole was so engrossed by the view that he had forgotten the passage of \par
time. Suddenly he realized that much more than five minutes had passed - yet the \par
elevator was still stationary. Had something gone wrong - or were they waiting \par
for late arrivals?\par
\par
    And then he noticed something so extraordinary that at first he refused to \par
believe the evidence of his eyes. The panorama had expanded, as if he had \par
already risen hundreds of kilometres! Even as he watched, he noticed new \par
features of the planet below creeping into the frame of the window.\par
\par
    Then Poole laughed, as the obvious explanation occurred to him.\par
\par
    'You could have fooled me, Indra! I thought this was real - not a video \par
projection!'\par
\par
    Indra looked back at him with a quizzical smile.\par
\par
    'Think again, Frank. We started to move about ten minutes ago. By now we \par
must be climbing at, oh - at least a thousand kilometres an hour. Though I'm \par
told these elevators can reach a hundred gee at maximum acceleration, we won't \par
touch more than ten, on this short run.'\par
\par
    'That's impossible! Six is the maximum they ever gave me in the centrifuge, \par
and I didn't enjoy weighing half a ton. I know we haven't moved since we stepped \par
inside.'\par
\par
    Poole had raised his voice slightly, and suddenly became aware that the \par
other passengers were pretending not to notice.\par
\par
    'I don't understand how it's done, Frank, but it's called an inertial field. \par
Or sometimes a Sharp one - the "S" stands for a famous Russian scientist, \par
Sakharov - I don't know who the others were.'\par
\par
    Slowly, understanding dawned in Poole's mind - and also a sense of awe-\par
struck wonder. Here indeed was a 'technology indistinguishable from magic'.\par
\par
    'Some of my friends used to dream of "space drives" - energy fields that \par
could replace rockets, and allow movement without any feeling of acceleration, \par
Most of us thought they were crazy - but it seems they were right! I can still \par
hardly believe it... and unless I'm mistaken, we're starting to lose weight.'\par
\par
    'Yes - it's adjusting to the lunar value. When we step out, you'll feel \par
we're on the Moon. But for goodness' sake, Frank - forget you're an engineer, \par
and simply enjoy the view.'\par
\par
    It was good advice, but even as he watched the whole of Africa, Europe and \par
much of Asia flow into his field of vision, Poole could not tear his mind away \par
from this astonishing revelation. Yet he should not have been wholly surprised: \par
he knew that there had been major breakthroughs in space propulsion systems \par
since his time, but had not realized that they would have such dramatic \par
applications to everyday life - if that term could be applied to existence in a \par
thirty-six-thousand-kilometre-high skyscraper.\par
\par
    And the age of the rocket must have been over, centuries ago. All his \par
knowledge of propellant systems and combustion chambers, ion thrusters and \par
fusion reactors, was totally obsolete. Of course, that no longer mattered - but \par
he understood the sadness that the skipper of a windjammer must have felt, when \par
sail gave way to steam.\par
\par
    His mood changed abruptly, and he could not help smiling, when the robovoice \par
announced, 'Arriving in two minutes. Please make sure that you do not leave any \par
of your personal belongings behind.'\par
\par
    How often he had heard that announcement, on some commercial flight? He \par
looked at his watch, and was surprised to see that they had been ascending for \par
less than half an hour So that meant an average speed of at least twenty \par
thousand kilometres an hour, yet they might never have moved. What was even \par
stranger - for the last ten minutes or more they must actually have been \par
decelerating so rapidly that by rights they should all have been standing on the \par
roof, heads pointing towards Earth!\par
\par
    The doors opened silently, and as Poole stepped out he again felt the slight \par
disorientation he had noticed on entering the elevator lounge. This time, \par
however, he knew what it meant: he was moving through the transition zone where \par
the inertial field overlapped with gravity - at this level, equal to the Moon's.\par
\par
    Indra and Danil followed him, walking carefully now at a third of their \par
customary weight, as they went forward to meet the next of the day's wonders.\par
\par
    Though the view of the receding Earth had been awesome, even for an \par
astronaut, there was nothing unexpected or surprising about it. But who would \par
have imagined a gigantic chamber, apparently occupying the entire width of the \par
Tower, so that the far wall was more than five kilometres away? Perhaps by this \par
time there were larger enclosed volumes on the Moon and Mars, but this must \par
surely be one of the largest in space itself.\par
\par
    They were standing on a viewing platform, fifty metres up on the outer wall, \par
looking across an astonishingly varied panorama. Obviously, an attempt had been \par
made to reproduce a whole range of terrestrial biomes. Immediately beneath them \par
was a group of slender trees which Poole could not at first identify: then he \par
realized that they were oaks, adapted to one-sixth of their normal gravity. \par
What, he wondered, would palm frees look like here? Giant reeds, probably...\par
\par
    In the middle-distance there was a small lake, fed by a river that meandered \par
across a grassy plain, then disappeared into something that looked like a single \par
gigantic banyan tree. What was the source of the water? Poole had become aware \par
of a faint drumming sound, and as he swept his gaze along the gently curving \par
wall, he discovered a miniature Niagara, with a perfect rainbow hovering in the \par
spray above it.\par
\par
    He could have stood here for hours, admiring the view and still not \par
exhausting all the wonders of this complex and brilliantly contrived simulation \par
of the planet below. As it spread out into new and hostile environments, perhaps \par
the human race felt an ever-increasing need to remember its origins. Of course, \par
even in his own time every city had its parks as - usually feeble - reminders of \par
Nature. The same impulse must be acting here, on a much grander scale. Central \par
Park, Africa Tower!\par
\par
    'Let's go down,' said Indra. 'There's so much to see, and I don't come here \par
as often as I'd like.'\par
\par
    Followed by the silent but ever-present Danil, who always seemed to know \par
when he was needed but otherwise kept out of the way, they began a leisurely \par
exploration of this oasis in space. Though walking was almost effortless in this \par
low gravity, from time to time they took advantage of a small monorail, and \par
stopped once for refreshments at a cafe\'b4, cunningly concealed in the trunk of a \par
redwood that must have been at least a quarter of a kilometre tall.\par
\par
    There were very few other people about - their fellow passengers had long \par
since disappeared into the landscape - so it was as if they had all this \par
wonderland to themselves.\par
\par
    Everything was so beautifully maintained, presumably by armies of robots, \par
that from time to time Poole was reminded of a visit he had made to Disney World \par
as a small boy. But this was even better: there were no crowds, and indeed very \par
little reminder of the human race and its artefacts.\par
\par
    They were admiring a superb collection of orchids, some of enormous size, \par
when Poole had one of the biggest shocks of his life. As they walked past a \par
typical small gardener's shed, the door opened - and the gardener emerged.\par
\par
    Frank Poole had always prided himself on his self-control, and never \par
imagined that as a full-grown adult he would give a cry of pure fright. But like \par
every boy of his generation, he had seen all the 'Jurassic' movies - and he knew \par
a raptor when he met one eye to eye.\par
\par
    'I'm terribly sorry,' said Indra, with obvious concern. 'I never thought of \par
warning you.'\par
\par
    Poole's jangling nerves returned to normal. Of course, there could be no \par
danger, in this perhaps too-well-ordered world: but still...!\par
\par
    The dinosaur returned his stare with apparent total disinterest, then \par
doubled back into the shed and emerged again with a rake and a pair of garden \par
shears, which it dropped into a bag hanging over one shoulder. It walked away \par
from them with a bird-like gait, never looking back as it disappeared behind \par
some ten-metre-high sunflowers.\par
\par
    'I should explain,' said Indra contritely. 'We like to use bio-organisms \par
when we can, rather than robots - I suppose it's carbon chauvinism! Now, there \par
are only a few animals that have any manual dexterity, and we've used them all \par
at one time or another.'\par
\par
    'And here's a mystery that no one's been able to solve. You'd think that \par
enhanced herbivores like orangutans and gorillas would be good at this sort of \par
work. Well, they're not; they don't have the patience for it.'\par
\par
    'Yet carnivores like our friend here are excellent, and easily trained. \par
What's more - here's another paradox! -after they've been modified they're \par
docile and good-natured. Of course, there's almost a thousand years of genetic \par
engineering behind them, and look what primitive man did to the wolf, merely by \par
trial and error!'\par
\par
    Indra laughed and continued: 'You may not believe this, Frank, but they also \par
make good baby-sitters - children love them! There's a five-hundred-year-old \par
joke: "Would you trust your kids to a dinosaur?" "What - and risk injuring it?"'\par
\par
    Poole joined in the laughter, partly in shame-faced reaction to his own \par
fright. To change the subject, he asked Indra the question that was still \par
worrying him.\par
\par
    'All this,' he said, 'it's wonderful - but why go to so much trouble, when \par
anyone in the Tower can reach the real thing, just as quickly?'\par
\par
    Indra looked at him thoughtfully, weighing her words. 'That's not quite \par
true. It's uncomfortable - even dangerous - for anyone who lives above the half-\par
gee level to go down to Earth, even in a hoverchair. So it has to be this -or, \par
as you used to say, Virtual Reality.'\par
\par
    (Now I begin to understand, Poole told himself bleakly. That explains \par
Anderson's evasiveness, and all the tests he's been doing to see if I've \par
regained my strength. I've come all the way back from Jupiter, to within two \par
thousand kilometres of Earth - but I may never again walk on the surface of my \par
home planet. I'm not sure how I will be able to handle this...)\par
\par
    \par
\par
10\par
Homage to Icarus\par
\par
    \par
\par
    His depression quickly passed: there was so much to do and see. A thousand \par
lifetimes would not have been enough, and the problem was to choose which of the \par
myriad distractions this age could offer. He tried, not always successfully, to \par
avoid the trivia, and to concentrate on the things that mattered - notably his \par
education.\par
\par
    The Braincap - and the book-sized player that went with it, inevitably \par
called the Brainbox - was of enormous value here. He soon had a small library of \par
'instant knowledge' tablets, each containing all the material needed for a \par
college degree. When he slipped one of these into the Brainbox, and gave it the \par
speed and intensity adjustments that most suited him, there would be a flash of \par
light, followed by a period of unconsciousness that might last as long as an \par
hour. When he awoke, it seemed that new areas of his mind had been opened up, \par
though he only knew they were there when he searched for them. It was almost as \par
if he was the owner of a library who had suddenly discovered shelves of books he \par
did not know he possessed.\par
\par
    To a large extent, he was the master of his own time. Out of a sense of duty \par
- and gratitude - he acceded to as many requests as he could from scientists, \par
historians, writers and artists working in media that were often \par
incomprehensible to him. He also had countless invitations from other citizens \par
of the four Towers, virtually all of which he was compelled to turn down.\par
\par
    Most tempting - and most hard to resist - were those that came from the \par
beautiful planet spread out below. 'Of course,' Professor Anderson had told him, \par
'you'd survive if you went down for short time with the right life-support \par
system, but you wouldn't enjoy it. And it might weaken your neuromuscular system \par
even further. It's never really recovered from that thousand-year sleep.'\par
\par
    His other guardian, Indra Wallace, protected him from unnecessary \par
intrusions, and advised him which requests he should accept - and which he \par
should politely refuse. By himself, he would never understand the socio-\par
political structure of this incredibly complex culture, but he soon gathered \par
that, although in theory all class distinctions had vanished, there were a few \par
thousand super-citizens. George Orwell had been right; some would always be more \par
equal than others.\par
\par
    There had been times when, conditioned by his twentyfirst-century \par
experience, Poole had wondered who was paying for all this hospitality - would \par
he one day be presented with the equivalent of an enormous hotel bill? But Indra \par
had quickly reassured him: he was a unique and priceless museum exhibit, so \par
would never have to worry about such mundane considerations. Anything he wanted \par
- within reason - would be made available to him: Poole wondered what the limits \par
were, never imagining that one day he would attempt to discover them.\par
\par
    \par
\par
    All the most important things in life happen by accident, and he had set his \par
wall display browser on random scan, silent, when a striking image caught his \par
attention.\par
\par
    'Stop scan! Sound up!' he shouted, with quite unnecessary loudness.\par
\par
    He recognized the music, but it was a few minutes before he identified it; \par
the fact that his wall was filled with winged humans circling gracefully round \par
each other undoubtedly helped. But Tchaikovsky would have been utterly \par
astonished to see this performance of Swan Lake - with the dancers actually \par
flying...\par
\par
    Poole watched, entranced, for several minutes, until he was fairly confident \par
that this was reality, and not a simulation: even in his own day, one could \par
never be quite certain. Presumably the ballet was being performed in one of the \par
many low-gravity environments - a very large one, judging by some of the images. \par
It might even be here in Africa Tower.\par
\par
    I want to try that, Poole decided. He had never quite forgiven the Space \par
Agency for banning one of his greatest pleasures - delayed parachute formation \par
jumping - even though he could see the Agency's point in not wanting to risk a \par
valuable investment. The doctors had been quite unhappy about his earlier hang-\par
gliding accident; fortunately his teenage bones had healed completely.\par
\par
    'Well,' he thought, 'there's no one to stop me now unless it's Prof. \par
Anderson...'\par
\par
    To Poole's relief, the physician thought it an excellent idea, and he was \par
also pleased to find that every one of the Towers had its own Aviary, up at the \par
one-tenth-gee level.\par
\par
    Within a few days he was being measured for his wings, not in the least like \par
the elegant versions worn by the performers of Swan Lake. Instead of feathers \par
there was a flexible membrane, and when he grasped the hand-holds attached to \par
the supporting ribs, Poole realized that he must look much more like a bat than \par
a bird. However his 'Move over, Dracula!' was completely wasted on his \par
instructor, who was apparently unacquainted with vampires.\par
\par
    For his first lessons he was restrained by a light harness, so that he did \par
not move anywhere while he was taught the basic strokes - and, most important of \par
all, learned control and stability. Like many acquired skills, it was not quite \par
as easy as it looked.\par
\par
    He felt ridiculous in this safety-harness - how could anyone injure \par
themselves at a tenth of a gravity! - and was glad that he needed only a few \par
lessons; doubtless his astronaut training helped. He was, the Wingmaster told \par
him, the best pupil he had ever taught: but perhaps he said that to all of them.\par
\par
    After a dozen free-flights in a chamber forty metres on a side, criss-\par
crossed with various obstacles which he easily avoided, Poole was given the all-\par
clear for his first solo - and felt nineteen years old again, about to take off \par
in the Flagstaff Aero Club's antique Cessna.\par
\par
    The unexciting name 'The Aviary' had not prepared him for the venue of this \par
maiden flight. Though it seemed even more enormous than the space holding the \par
forests and gardens down at the lunar-gee level, it was almost the same size, \par
since it too occupied an entire floor of the gently tapering Tower. A circular \par
void, half a kilometre high and over four kilometres wide, it appeared truly \par
enormous, as there were no features on which the eye could rest. Because the \par
walls were a uniform pale blue, they contributed to the impression of infinite \par
space.\par
\par
    Poole had not really believed the Wingmaster's boast, 'You can have any \par
scenery you like', and intended to throw him what he was sure was an impossible \par
challenge. But on this first flight, at the dizzy altitude of fifty metres, \par
there were no visual distractions, Of course, a fall from the equivalent \par
altitude of five metres in the ten-fold greater Earth gravity could break one's \par
neck; however, even minor bruises were unlikely here, as the entire floor was \par
covered with a network of flexible cables The whole chamber was a giant \par
trampoline; one could, thought Poole, have a lot of fun here - even without \par
wings.\par
\par
    With firm, downward strokes, Poole lifted himself into the air. In almost no \par
time, it seemed that he was a hundred metres in the air, and still rising.\par
\par
    'Slow down' said the Wingmaster, 'I can't keep up with you,'\par
\par
    Poole straightened out, then attempted a slow roll. He felt light-headed as \par
well as light-bodied (less than ten kilograms!) and wondered if the \par
concentration of oxygen had been increased.\par
\par
    This was wonderful - quite different from zero gravity, as it posed more of \par
a physical challenge. The nearest thing to it was scuba diving: he wished there \par
were birds here, to emulate the equally colourful coral fish who had so often \par
accompanied him over tropical reefs.\par
\par
    One by one, the Wingmaster put him through a series of manoeuvres - rolls, \par
loops, upside-down flying, hovering.\par
\par
    Finally he said: 'Nothing more I can teach you. Now let's enjoy the view.'\par
\par
    Just for a moment, Poole almost lost control - as he was probably expected \par
to do. For, without the slightest warning, he was surrounded by snow-capped \par
mountains, and was flying down a narrow pass, only metres from some unpleasantly \par
jagged rocks.\par
\par
    Of course, this could not be real: those mountains were as insubstantial as \par
clouds, and he could fly right through them if he wished. Nevertheless, he \par
veered away from the cliff-face (there was an eagle's nest on one of its ledges, \par
holding two eggs which he felt he could touch if he came closer) and headed for \par
more open space.\par
\par
    The mountains vanished; suddenly, it was night. And then the stars came out \par
- not the miserable few thousand in the impoverished skies of Earth, but legions \par
beyond counting. And not only stars, but the spiral whirlpools of distant \par
galaxies, the teeming, close-packed sun-swarms of globular clusters.\par
\par
    There was no possible way this could be real, even if he had been magically \par
transported to some world where such skies existed. For those galaxies were \par
receding even as he watched; stars were fading, exploding, being born in stellar \par
nurseries of glowing fire-mist. Every second, a million years must be passing...\par
\par
    The overwhelming spectacle disappeared as quickly as it had come: he was \par
back in the empty sky, alone except for his instructor, in the featureless blue \par
cylinder of the Aviary.\par
\par
    'I think that's enough for one day,' said the Wingmaster, hovering a few \par
metres above Poole. 'What scenery would you like, the next time you come here?'\par
\par
    Poole did not hesitate. With a smile, he answered the question.\par
\par
    \par
\par
11\par
Here be Dragons\par
\par
    \par
\par
    He would never have believed it possible, even with the technology of this \par
day and age. How many terabytes - petabytes - was there a large enough word? - \par
of information must have been accumulated over the centuries, and in what sort \par
of storage medium? Better not think about it, and follow Indra's advice: 'Forget \par
you're an engineer - and enjoy yourself.'\par
\par
    He was certainly enjoying himself now, though his pleasure was mixed with an \par
almost overwhelming sense of nostalgia. For he was flying, or so it seemed, at \par
an altitude of about two kilometres, above the spectacular and unforgotten \par
landscape of his youth. Of course, the perspective was false, since the Aviary \par
was only half a kilometre high, but the illusion was perfect.\par
\par
    He circled Meteor Crater, remembering how he had scrambled up its sides \par
during his earlier astronaut training. How incredible that anyone could ever \par
have doubted its origin, and the accuracy of its name! Yet well into the \par
twentieth century, distinguished geologists had argued that it was volcanic: not \par
until the coming of the Space Age was it - reluctantly - accepted that all \par
planets were still under continual bombardment.\par
\par
    Poole was quite sure that his comfortable cruising speed was nearer twenty \par
than two hundred kilometres an hour, yet he had been allowed to reach Flagstaff \par
in less than fifteen minutes. And there were the whitely-gleaming domes of the \par
Lowell Observatory, which he had visited so  often as a boy, and whose friendly \par
staff had undoubtedly been responsible for his choice of career. He had \par
sometimes wondered what his profession might have been, had he not been born in \par
Arizona, near the very spot where the most long-enduring and influential of \par
Martian fantasies had been created. Perhaps it was imagination, but Poole \par
thought he could just see Lowell's unique tomb, close to the great telescope, \par
which had fuelled his dreams.\par
\par
    From what year, and what season, had this image been captured? He guessed it \par
had come from the spy satellites which had watched over the world of the early \par
twenty-first century. It could not be much later than his own time, for the \par
layout of the city was just as he remembered. Perhaps if he went low enough he \par
would even see himself...\par
\par
    But he knew that was absurd; he had already discovered that this was the \par
nearest he could get. If he flew any closer, the image would start to breakup, \par
revealing its basic pixels. It was better to keep his distance, and not destroy \par
the beautiful illusion.\par
\par
    And there - it was incredible! - was the little park where he had played \par
with his junior and high-school friends. The City Fathers were always arguing \par
about its maintenance, as the water supply became more and more critical. Well, \par
at least it had survived to this time - whenever that might be.\par
\par
    And then another memory brought tears to his eyes. Along those narrow paths, \par
whenever he could get home from Houston or the Moon, he had walked with his \par
beloved Rhodesian Ridgeback, throwing sticks for him to retrieve, as man and dog \par
had done from time immemorial.\par
\par
    Poole had hoped, with all his heart, that Rikki would still be there to \par
greet him when he returned from Jupiter, and had left him in the care of his \par
younger brother Martin. He almost lost control, and sank several metres before \par
regaining stability, as he once more faced the bitter truth that both Rikki and \par
Martin had been dust for centuries.\par
\par
    When he could see properly again, he noticed that the dark band of the Grand \par
Canyon was just visible on the far horizon. He was debating whether to head for \par
it - he was growing a little tired - when he became aware that he was not alone \par
in the sky. Something else was approaching, and it was certainly not a human \par
flyer. Although it was difficult to judge distances here, it seemed much too \par
large for that.\par
\par
    Well, he thought, I'm not particularly surprised to meet a pterodactyl here \par
- indeed, it's just the sort of thing I'd expect. I hope it's friendly - or that \par
I can outfly it if it isn't. Oh, no!\par
\par
    A pterodactyl was not a bad guess: maybe eight points out of ten. What was \par
approaching him now, with slow flaps of its great leathery wings, was a dragon \par
straight out of Fairyland. And, to complete the picture, there was a beautiful \par
lady riding on its back. At least, Poole assumed she was beautiful. The \par
traditional image was rather spoiled by one trifling detail: much of her face \par
was concealed by a large pair of aviator's goggles that might have come straight \par
from the open cockpit of a World War I biplane.\par
\par
    Poole hovered in mid-air, like a swimmer treading water, until the oncoming \par
monster came close enough for him to hear the flapping of its great wings. Even \par
when it was less than twenty metres away, he could not decide whether it was a \par
machine or a bio-construct: probably both.\par
\par
    And then he forgot about the dragon, for the rider removed her goggles.\par
\par
    The trouble with cliche\'b4s, some philosopher remarked, probably with a yawn, \par
is that they are so boringly true.\par
\par
    But 'love at first sight' is never boring.\par
\par
    \par
\par
    Danil could provide no information, but then Poole had not expected any from \par
him. His ubiquitous escort - he certainly would not pass muster as a classic \par
valet - seemed so limited in his functions that Poole sometimes wondered if he \par
was mentally handicapped, unlikely though that seemed. He understood the \par
functioning of all the household appliances, carried out simple orders with \par
speed and efficiency, and knew his way about the Tower. But that was all; it was \par
impossible to have an intelligent conversation with him, and any polite queries \par
about his family were met with a look of blank incomprehension. Poole had even \par
wondered if he too was a bio-robot.\par
\par
    Indra, however, gave him the answer he needed right away.\par
\par
    'Oh, you've met the Dragon Lady!'\par
\par
    'Is that what you call her? What's her real name - and can you get me her \par
Ident? We were hardly in a position to touch palms.'\par
\par
    'Of course - no problemo.'\par
\par
    'Where did you pick up that?'\par
\par
    Indra looked uncharacteristically confused.\par
\par
    'I've no idea - some old book or movie. Is it a good figure of speech?'\par
\par
    'Not if you're over fifteen.'\par
\par
    'I'll try to remember. Now tell me what happened - unless you want to make \par
me jealous.'\par
\par
    They were now such good friends that they could discuss any subject with \par
perfect frankness. Indeed, they had laughingly lamented their total lack of \par
romantic interest in each other - though Indra had once commented, 'I guess that \par
if we were both marooned on a desert asteroid, with no hope of rescue, we could \par
come to some arrangement.'\par
\par
    'First, you tell me who she is.'\par
\par
    'Her name's Aurora McAuley; among many other things, she's President of the \par
Society for Creative Anachronisms. And if you thought Draco was impressive, wait \par
until you see some of their other - ah - creations. Like Moby Dick - and a whole \par
zooful of dinosaurs Mother Nature never thought of.'\par
\par
    This is too good to be true, thought Poole.\par
\par
    I am the biggest anachronism on Planet Earth.\par
\par
    \par
\par
12\par
Frustration\par
\par
    \par
\par
    Until now, he had almost forgotten that conversation with the Space Agency \par
psychologist.\par
\par
    'You may be gone from Earth for at least three years. If you like, I can \par
give you a harmless anaphrodisiac implant that will last out the mission. I \par
promise we'll more than make it up, when you get home.'\par
\par
    'No thanks,' Poole had answered, trying to keep his face straight when he \par
continued, 'I think I can handle it.'\par
\par
    Nevertheless, he had become suspicious after the third or fourth week - and \par
so had Dave Bowman.\par
\par
    'I've noticed it too,' Dave said 'I bet those damn doctors put something in \par
our diet...'\par
\par
    Whatever that something was - if indeed it had ever existed - it was \par
certainly long past its shelf-life. Until now, Poole had been too busy to get \par
involved in any emotional entanglements, and had politely turned down generous \par
offers from several young (and not so young) ladies. He was not sure whether it \par
was his physique or his fame that appealed to them: perhaps it was nothing more \par
than simple curiosity about a man who, for all they knew, might be an ancestor \par
from twenty or thirty generations in the past.\par
\par
    To Poole's delight, Mistress McAuley's Ident conveyed the information that \par
she was currently between lovers, and he wasted no further time in contacting \par
her. Within twenty-four hours he was pillion-riding, with his arms enjoyably \par
around her waist. He had also learned why aviator's goggles were a good idea, \par
for Draco was entirely robotic, and could easily cruise at a hundred klicks. \par
Poole doubted if any real dragons had ever attained such speeds.\par
\par
    He was not surprised that the ever-changing landscapes below them were \par
straight out of legend. Ali Baba had waved angrily at them, as they overtook his \par
flying carpet, shouting 'Can't you see where you're going!' Yet he must be a \par
long way from Baghdad, because the dreaming spires over which they now circled \par
could only be Oxford.\par
\par
    Aurora confirmed his guess as she pointed down: 'That's the pub - the inn - \par
where Lewis and Tolkien used to meet their friends, the Inklings. And look at \par
the river - that boat just coming out from the bridge - do you see the two \par
little girls and the clergyman in it?'\par
\par
    'Yes,' he shouted back against the gentle sussuration of Draco's slipstream. \par
'And I suppose one of them is Alice.'\par
\par
    Aurora turned and smiled at him over her shoulder: she seemed genuinely \par
delighted.\par
\par
    'Quite correct: she's an accurate replica, based on the Reverend's photos. I \par
was afraid you wouldn't know. So many people stopped reading soon after your \par
time.'\par
\par
    Poole felt a glow of satisfaction.\par
\par
    I believe I've passed another test, he told himself smugly. Riding on Draco \par
must have been the first. How many more, I wonder? Fighting with broadswords?\par
\par
    But there were no more, and the answer to the immemorial 'Your place or \par
mine?' was - Poole's.\par
\par
    \par
\par
    The next morning, shaken and mortified, he contacted Professor Anderson.\par
\par
    'Everything was going splendidly,' he lamented, 'when she suddenly became \par
hysterical and pushed me away. I was afraid I'd hurt her somehow -'Then she \par
called the roomlight - we'd been in darkness - and jumped out of bed. I guess I \par
was just staring like a fool...' He laughed ruefully. 'She was certainly worth \par
staring at.'\par
\par
    'I'm sure of it. Go on.'\par
\par
    'After a few minutes she relaxed and said something I'll never be able to \par
forget.'\par
\par
    Anderson waited patiently for Poole to compose himself. 'She said: "I'm \par
really sorry, Frank. We could have had a good time. But I didn't know that you'd \par
been - mutilated."\par
\par
    The professor looked baffled, but only for a moment. 'Oh - I understand. I'm \par
sorry too, Frank - perhaps I should have warned you. In my thirty years of \par
practice, I've only seen half a dozen cases - all for valid medical reasons, \par
which certainly didn't apply to you...'\par
\par
    'Circumcision made a lot of sense in primitive times - and even in your \par
century - as a defence against some unpleasant - even fatal - diseases in \par
backward countries with poor hygiene. But otherwise there was absolutely no \par
excuse for it - and several arguments against, as you've just discovered!'\par
\par
    'I checked the records after I'd examined you the first time, and found that \par
by mid-twenty-first century there had been so many malpractice suits that the \par
American Medical Association had been forced to ban it. The arguments among the \par
contemporary doctors are very entertaining.'\par
\par
    'I'm sure they are,' said Poole morosely.\par
\par
    'In some countries it continued for another century: then some unknown \par
genius coined a slogan - please excuse the vulgarity - "God designed us: \par
circumcision is blasphemy". That more or less ended the practice. But if you \par
want, it would be easy to arrange a transplant - you wouldn't be making medical \par
history, by any means.'\par
\par
    'I don't think it would work. Afraid I'd start laughing every time.'\par
\par
    'That's the spirit - you're already getting over it.'\par
\par
    Somewhat to his surprise, Poole realized that Anderson's prognosis was \par
correct. He even found himself already laughing.\par
\par
    'Now what, Frank?'\par
\par
    'Aurora's "Society for Creative Anachronisms". I'd hoped it would improve my \par
chances. Just my luck to have found one anachronism she doesn't appreciate.'\par
\par
    \par
\par
13\par
Stranger in a Strange Time\par
\par
    \par
\par
    Indra was not quite as sympathetic as he had hoped: perhaps, after all, \par
there was some sexual jealousy in their relationship. And - much more serious - \par
what they wryly labelled the Dragon Debacle led to their first real argument.\par
\par
    It began innocently enough, when Indra complained:\par
\par
    'People are always asking me why I've devoted my life to such a horrible \par
period of history, and it's not much of an answer to say that there were even \par
worse ones.'\par
\par
    'Then why are you interested in my century?'\par
\par
    'Because it marks the transition between barbarism and civilization.'\par
\par
    'Thank you. Just call me Conan.'\par
\par
    'Conan? The only one I know is the man who invented Sherlock Holmes.'\par
\par
    'Never mind - sorry I interrupted. Of course, we in the so-called developed \par
countries thought we were civilized. At least war wasn't respectable any more, \par
and the United Nations was always doing its best to stop the wars that did break \par
out.'\par
\par
    'Not very successfully: I'd give it about three out of ten. But what we find \par
incredible is the way that people - right up to the early 2000s! - calmly \par
accepted behaviour we would consider atrocious. And believed in the most mind-\par
boggled -'\par
\par
    'Boggling.'\par
\par
    '- nonsense, which surely any rational person would dismiss out of hand.'\par
\par
    'Examples, please.'\par
\par
    'Well, your really trivial loss started me doing some research, and I was \par
appalled by what I found. Did you know that every year in some countries \par
thousands of little girls were hideously mutilated to preserve their virginity? \par
Many of them died - but the authorities turned a blind eye.'\par
\par
    'I agree that was terrible - but what could my government do about it?'\par
\par
    'A great deal - if it wished. But that would have offended the people who \par
supplied it with oil and bought its weapons, like the landmines that killed and \par
maimed civilians by the thousand.'\par
\par
    'You don't understand, Indra. Often we had no choice: we couldn't reform the \par
whole world. And didn't somebody once say "Politics is the art of the \par
possible"?'\par
\par
    'Quite true - which is why only second-rate minds go into it. Genius likes \par
to challenge the impossible.'\par
\par
    'Well, I'm glad you have a good supply of genius, so you can put things \par
right.'\par
\par
    'Do I detect a hint of sarcasm? Thanks to our computers, we can run \par
political experiments in cyberspace before trying them out in practice. Lenin \par
was unlucky; he was born a hundred years too soon. Russian communism might have \par
worked - at least for a while - if it had had microchips. And had managed to \par
avoid Stalin.'\par
\par
    Poole was constantly amazed by Indra's knowledge of his age - as well as by \par
her ignorance of so much that he took for granted. In a way, he had the reverse \par
problem. Even if he lived the hundred years that had been confidently promised \par
him, he could never learn enough to feel at home. In any conversation, there \par
would always be references he did not understand, and jokes that would go over \par
his head. Worse still, he would always feel on the verge of some "faux pas" - \par
about to create some social disaster that would embarrass even the best of his \par
new friends...\par
\par
    Such as the occasion when he was lunching, fortunately in his own quarters, \par
with Indra and Professor Anderson. The meals that emerged from the autochef were \par
always perfectly acceptable, having been designed to match his physiological \par
requirements. But they were certainly nothing to get excited about, and would \par
have been the despair of a twenty-first-century gourmet.\par
\par
    Then, one day, an unusually tasty dish appeared, which brought back vivid \par
memories of the deer-hunts and barbecues of his youth. However, there was \par
something unfamiliar about both flavour and texture, so Poole asked the obvious \par
question.\par
\par
    Anderson merely smiled, but for a few seconds Indra looked as if she was \par
about to be sick. Then she recovered and said: 'You tell him - after we've \par
finished eating.'\par
\par
    Now what have I done wrong? Poole asked himself. Half an hour later, with \par
Indra rather pointedly absorbed in a video display at the other end of the room, \par
his knowledge of the Third Millennium made another major advance.\par
\par
    'Corpse-food was on the way out even in your time,' Anderson explained. \par
'Raising animals to - ugh - eat them became economically impossible. I don't \par
know how many acres of land it took to feed one cow, but at least ten humans \par
could survive on the plants it produced. And probably a hundred, with hydroponic \par
techniques.\par
\par
    'But what finished the whole horrible business was not economics - but \par
disease. It started first with cattle, then spread to other food animals - a \par
kind of virus, I believe, that affected the brain, and caused a particularly \par
nasty death. Although a cure was eventually found, it was too late to turn back \par
the clock - and anyway, synthetic foods were now far cheaper, and you could get \par
them in any flavour you liked.'\par
\par
    Remembering weeks of satisfying but unexciting meals, Poole had strong \par
reservations about this. For why, he wondered, did he still have wistful dreams \par
of spare-ribs and cordon bleu steaks?\par
\par
    Other dreams were far more disturbing, and he was afraid that before long he \par
would have to ask Anderson for medical assistance. Despite everything that was \par
being done to make him feel at home, the strangeness and sheer complexity of \par
this new world were beginning to overwhelm him. During sleep, as if in an \par
unconscious effort to escape, he often reverted to his earlier life: but when he \par
awoke, that only made matters worse.\par
\par
    He had travelled across to America Tower and looked down, in reality and not \par
in simulation, on the landscape of his youth - and it had not been a good idea. \par
With optical aid, when the atmosphere was clear, he'd got so close that he could \par
see individual human beings as they went about their affairs, sometimes along \par
streets that he remembered...\par
\par
    And always, at the back of his mind, was the knowledge that down there had \par
once lived everyone he had ever loved, Mother, Father (before he had gone off \par
with that Other Woman), dear Uncle George and Aunt Lil, brother Martin - and, \par
not least, a succession of dogs, beginning with the warm puppies of his earliest \par
childhood and culminating in Rikki.\par
\par
    Above all, there was the memory - and mystery - of Helena...\par
\par
    It had begun as a casual affair, in the early days of his astrotraining, but \par
had become more and more serious as the years went by. Just before he had left \par
for Jupiter, they had planned to make it permanent when he returned.\par
\par
    And if he did not, Helena wished to have his child. He still recalled the \par
blend of solemnity and hilarity with which they had made the necessary \par
arrangements...\par
\par
    Now, a thousand years later, despite all his efforts, he had been unable to \par
find if Helena had kept her promise. Just as there were now gaps in his own \par
memory, so there were also in the collective records of Mankind. The worst was \par
that created by the devastating electromagnetic pulse from the 2304 asteroid \par
impact, which had wiped out several per cent of the world's information banks, \par
despite all backups and safety systems. Poole could not help wondering if, among \par
all the exabytes that were irretrievably lost, were the records of his own \par
children: even now, his descendants of the thirtieth generation might be walking \par
the Earth; but he would never know.\par
\par
    It helped a little to have discovered that - unlike Aurora -some ladies of \par
this era did not consider him to be damaged goods. On the contrary: they often \par
found his alteration quite exciting, but this slightly bizarre reaction made it \par
impossible for Poole to establish any close relationship. Nor was he anxious to \par
do so; all that he really needed was the occasional healthy, mindless exercise.\par
\par
    Mindless - that was the trouble. He no longer had arty purpose in life. And \par
the weight of too many memories was upon him; echoing the title of a famous book \par
he had read in his youth, he often said to himself, 'I am a Stranger in a \par
Strange Time.'\par
\par
    There were even occasions when he looked down at the beautiful planet on \par
which - if he obeyed doctor's orders - he could never walk again, and wondered \par
what it would be like to make a second acquaintance with the vacuum of space. \par
Though it was not easy to get through the airlocks without triggering some \par
alarm, it had been done: every few years, some determined suicide made a brief \par
meteoric display in the Earth's atmosphere.\par
\par
    Perhaps it was just as well that deliverance was on its way, from a \par
completely unexpected direction.\par
\par
     \par
\par
    * * *\par
\par
    'Nice to meet you, Commander Poole - for the second time.'\par
\par
    'I'm sorry - don't recall - but then I see so many people.'\par
\par
    'No need to apologize. First time was out round Neptune.'\par
\par
    'Captain Chandler - delighted to see you! Can I get something from the \par
autochef?'\par
\par
    'Anything with over twenty per cent alcohol will be fine.'\par
\par
    'And what are you doing back on Earth? They told me you never come inside \par
Mars orbit.'\par
\par
    'Almost true - though I was born here, I think it's a dirty, smelly place - \par
too many people - creeping up to a billion again!'\par
\par
    'More than ten billion in my time. By the way, did you get my "Thank you" \par
message?'\par
\par
    'Yes - and I know I should have contacted you. But I waited until I headed \par
sunwards again. So here I am. Your good health!'\par
\par
    As the Captain disposed of his drink with impressive speed, Poole tried to \par
analyse his visitor. Beards - even small goatees like Chandler's - were very \par
rare in this society, and he had never known an astronaut who wore one: they did \par
not co-exist comfortably with space-helmets. Of course, a Captain might go for \par
years between EVs, and in any case most outside jobs were done by robots; but \par
there was always the risk of the unexpected, when one might have to get suited \par
in a hurry. It was obvious that Chandler was something of an eccentric, and \par
Poole's heart warmed to him.\par
\par
    'You've not answered my question. If you don't like Earth, what are you \par
doing here?'\par
\par
    'Oh, mostly contacting old friends - it's wonderful to forget hour-long \par
delays, and to have real-time conversations! But of course that's not the \par
reason. My old rust-bucket is having a refit, up at the Rim shipyard. And the \par
armour has to be replaced; when it gets down to a few centimetres thick, I don't \par
sleep too well.'\par
\par
    'Armour?'\par
\par
    'Dust shield. Not such a problem in your time, was it? But it's a dirty \par
environment out round Jupiter, and our normal cruise speed is several thousand \par
klicks - a second! So there's a continuous gentle pattering, like raindrops on \par
the roof.'\par
\par
    'You're joking!'\par
\par
    'Course I am. If we really could hear anything, we'd be dead. Luckily, this \par
sort of unpleasantness is very rare - last serious accident was twenty years \par
ago. We know all the main comet streams, where most of the junk is, and are \par
careful to avoid them - except when we're matching velocity to round up ice.\par
\par
    'But why don't you come aboard and have a look around, before we take off \par
for Jupiter?'\par
\par
    'I'd be delighted... did you say Jupiter?'\par
\par
    'Well, Ganymede, of course - Anubis City. We've a lot of business there, and \par
several of us have families we haven't seen for months.'\par
\par
    Poole scarcely heard him.\par
\par
    Suddenly - unexpectedly - and perhaps none too soon, he had found a reason \par
for living.\par
\par
    Commander Frank Poole was the sort of man who hated to leave a job undone - \par
and a few specks of cosmic dust, even moving at a thousand kilometres a second, \par
were not likely to discourage him.\par
\par
    He had unfinished business at the world once known as Jupiter.\par
\par

GOLIATH\par
\par
    \par
\par
14\par
A Farewell to Earth\par
\par
    \par
\par
    'Anything you want within reason,' he had been told. Frank Poole was not \par
sure if his hosts would consider that returning to Jupiter was a reasonable \par
request; indeed, he was not quite sure himself, and was beginning to have second \par
thoughts.\par
\par
    He had already committed himself to scores of engagements, weeks in advance. \par
Most of them he would be happy to miss, but there were some he would be sorry to \par
forgo. In particular, he hated to disappoint the senior class from his old high \par
school - how astonishing that it still existed! - when they planned to visit him \par
next month.\par
\par
    However, he was relieved - and a little surprised - when both Indra and \par
Professor Anderson agreed that it was an excellent idea. For the first time, he \par
realized that they had been concerned with his mental health; perhaps a holiday \par
from Earth would be the best possible cure.\par
\par
    And, most important of all, Captain Chandler was delighted. 'You can have my \par
cabin,' he promised. 'I'll kick the First Mate out of hers.' There were times \par
when Poole wondered if Chandler, with his beard and swagger, was not another \par
anachronism. He could easily picture him on the bridge of a battered three-\par
master, with Skull and Crossbones flying overhead.\par
\par
    Once his decision had been made, events moved with surprising speed. He had \par
accumulated very few possessions, and fewer still that he needed to take with \par
him. The most important was Miss Pringle, his electronic alter ego and \par
secretary, now the storehouse of both his lives, and the small stack of terabyte \par
memories that went with her.\par
\par
    Miss Pringle was not much larger than the hand-held personal assistants of \par
his own age, and usually lived, like the Old West's Colt 45, in a quick-draw \par
holster at his waist. She could communicate with him by audio or Braincap, and \par
her prime duty was to act as an information filter and a buffer to the outside \par
world. Like any good secretary, she knew when to reply, in the appropriate \par
format: 'I'll put you through now' or - much more frequently: 'I'm sorry - Mr \par
Poole is engaged. Please record your message and he will get back to you as soon \par
as possible.' Usually, this was never.\par
\par
    There were very few farewells to be made: though realtime conversations \par
would be impossible owing to the sluggish velocity of radio waves, he would be \par
in constant touch with Indra and Joseph - the only genuine friends he had made.\par
\par
    Somewhat to his surprise, Poole realized that he would miss his enigmatic \par
but useful 'valet', because he would now have to handle all the small chores of \par
everyday life by himself. Danil bowed slightly when they parted, but otherwise \par
showed no sign of emotion, as they took the long ride up to the outer curve of \par
the world-circling wheel, thirty-six thousand kilometres above central Africa.\par
\par
    \par
\par
    'I'm not sure, Dim, that you'll appreciate the comparison. But do you know \par
what Goliath reminds me of?'\par
\par
    They were now such good friends that Poole could use the Captain's nickname \par
- but only when no one else was around.\par
\par
    'Something unflattering, I assume.'\par
\par
    'Not really. But when I was a boy, I came across a whole pile of old \par
science-fiction magazines that my Uncle George had abandoned - "pulps", they \par
were called, after the cheap paper they were printed on... most of them were \par
already falling to bits. They had wonderful garish covers, showing strange \par
planets and monsters - and, of course, spaceships!\par
\par
    'As I grew older, I realized how ridiculous those spaceships were. They were \par
usually rocket-driven - but there was never any sign of propellant tanks! Some \par
of them had rows of windows from stem to stem, just like ocean liners. There was \par
one favourite of mine with a huge glass dome - a space-going conservatory...\par
\par
    'Well, those old artists had the last laugh: too bad they could never know. \par
Goliath looks more like their dreams than the flying fuel-tanks we used to \par
launch from the Cape.\par
\par
    Your Inertial Drive still seems too good to be true - no visible means of \par
support, unlimited range and speed - sometimes I think I'm the one who's \par
dreaming!'\par
\par
    Chandler laughed and pointed to the view outside.\par
\par
    'Does that look like a dream?'\par
\par
    It was the first time that Poole had seen a genuine horizon since he had \par
come to Star City, and it was not quite as far away as he had expected. After \par
all, he was on the outer rim of a wheel seven times the diameter of Earth, so \par
surely the view across the roof of this artificial world should extend for \par
several hundred kilometres...\par
\par
    He used to be good at mental arithmetic - a rare achievement even in his \par
time, and probably much rarer now. The formula to give the horizon distance was \par
a simple one: the square root of twice your height times the radius - the sort \par
of thing you never forgot, even if you wanted to...\par
\par
    Let's see - we're about 8 metres up - so root 16 - this is easy! - say big R \par
is 40,000 - knock off those three zeros to make it all klicks - 4 times root 40 \par
- hmm - just over 25...\par
\par
    Well, twenty-five kilometres was a fair distance, and certainly no spaceport \par
on Earth had ever seemed this huge. Even knowing perfectly well what to expect, \par
it was uncanny to watch vessels many times the size of his long-lost Discovery \par
lifting off, not only with no sound, but with no apparent means of propulsion. \par
Though Poole missed the flame and fury of the old-time countdowns, he had to \par
admit that this was cleaner, more efficient - and far safer.\par
\par
    Strangest of all, though, was to sit up here on the Rim, in the \par
Geostationary Orbit itself - and to feel weight! Just metres away, outside the \par
window of the tiny observation lounge, servicing robots and a few spacesuited \par
humans were gliding gently about their business; yet here inside Goliath the \par
inertial field was maintaining standard Mars-gee.\par
\par
    'Sure you don't want to change your mind, Frank?' Captain Chandler had asked \par
jokingly, as he left for the bridge. 'Still ten minutes before lift-off.'\par
\par
    'Wouldn't be very popular if I did, would I? No - as they used to say back \par
in the old days - we have commit. Ready or not, here I come.'\par
\par
    Poole felt the need to be alone when the drive went on, and the tiny crew - \par
only four men and three women - respected his wish. Perhaps they guessed how he \par
must be feeling, to leave Earth for the second time in a thousand years - and, \par
once again, to face an unknown destiny.\par
\par
    Jupiter-Lucifer was on the other side of the Sun, and the almost straight \par
line of Goliath's orbit would take them close to Venus. Poole looked forward to \par
seeing, with his own unaided eyes, if Earth's sister planet was now beginning to \par
live up to that description, after centuries of terraforming.\par
\par
    From a thousand kilometres up, Star City looked like a gigantic metal band \par
around Earth's Equator, dotted with gantries, pressure domes, scaffolding \par
holding half-completed ships, antennas, and other more enigmatic structures. It \par
was diminishing swiftly as Goliath headed sunwards, and presently Poole could \par
see how incomplete it was: there were huge gaps spanned only by a spider's web \par
of scaffolding, which would probably never be completely enclosed.\par
\par
    And now they were falling below the plane of the ring; it was midwinter in \par
the northern hemisphere, so the slim halo of Star City was inclined at over \par
twenty degrees to the Sun. Already Poole could see the American and Asian \par
towers, as shining threads stretching outwards and away, beyond the blue haze of \par
the atmosphere.\par
\par
    He was barely conscious of time as Goliath gained speed, moving more swiftly \par
than any comet that had ever fallen sunwards from interstellar space. The Earth, \par
almost full, still spanned his field of view, and he could now see the full \par
length of the Africa Tower which had been his home in the life he was now \par
leaving - perhaps, he could not help thinking, leaving for ever.\par
\par
    When they were fifty thousand kilometres out, he was able to view the whole \par
of Star City, as a narrow ellipse enclosing the Earth. Though the far side was \par
barely visible, as a hair-line of light against the stars, it was awe-inspiring \par
to think that the human race had now set this sign upon the heavens.\par
\par
    Then Poole remembered the rings of Saturn, infinitely more glorious. The \par
astronautical engineers still had a long, long way to go, before they could \par
match the achievements of Nature.\par
\par
    Or, if that was the right word, Deus.\par
\par
    \par
\par
15\par
Transit of Venus\par
\par
    \par
\par
    When he woke the next morning, they were already at Venus. But the huge, \par
dazzling crescent of the still cloud-wrapped planet was not the most striking \par
object in the sky:\par
\par
    Goliath was floating above an endless expanse of crinkled silver foil, \par
flashing in the sunlight with ever-changing patterns as the ship drifted across \par
it.\par
\par
    Poole remembered that in his own age there had been an artist who had \par
wrapped whole buildings in plastic sheets: how he would have loved this \par
opportunity to package billions of tons of ice in a glittering envelope... Only \par
in this way could the core of a comet be protected from evaporation on its \par
decades-long journey sunwards.\par
\par
    'You're in luck, Frank,' Chandler had told him. 'This is something I've \par
never seen myself. It should be spectacular. Impact due in just over an hour. \par
We've given it a little nudge, to make sure it comes down in the right place. \par
Don't want anyone to get hurt.'\par
\par
    Poole looked at him in astonishment.\par
\par
    'You mean - there are already people on Venus?'\par
\par
    'About fifty mad scientists, near the South Pole. Of course, they're well \par
dug in, but we should shake them up a bit - even though Ground Zero is on the \par
other side of the planet. Or I should say "Atmosphere Zero" - it will be days \par
before anything except the shockwave gets down to the surface.'\par
\par
    As the cosmic iceberg, sparkling and flashing in its protective envelope, \par
dwindled away towards Venus, Poole was struck with a sudden, poignant memory. \par
The Christmas trees of his childhood had been adorned with just such ornaments, \par
delicate bubbles of coloured glass. And the comparison was not completely \par
ludicrous: for many families on Earth, this was still the right season for \par
gifts, and Goliath was bringing a present beyond price to another world.\par
\par
    The radar image of the tortured Venusian landscape - its weird volcanoes, \par
pancake domes, and narrow, sinuous canyons - dominated the main screen of \par
Goliath's control centre, but Poole preferred the evidence of his own eyes. \par
Although the unbroken sea of clouds that covered the planet revealed nothing of \par
the inferno beneath, he wanted to see what would happen when the stolen comet \par
struck. In a matter of seconds, the myriad of tons of frozen hydrates that had \par
been gathering speed for decades on the downhill run from Neptune would deliver \par
all their energy...\par
\par
    The initial flash was even brighter than he had expected. How strange that a \par
missile made of ice could generate temperatures that must be in the tens of \par
thousands of degrees! Though the filters of the view-port would have absorbed \par
all the dangerous shorter wave-lengths, the fierce blue of the fireball \par
proclaimed that it was hotter than the Sun.\par
\par
    It was cooling rapidly as it expanded - through yellow, orange, red... The \par
shockwave would now be spreading outwards at the velocity of sound - and what a \par
sound that must be! - so in a few minutes there should be some visible \par
indication of its passage across the face of Venus.\par
\par
    And there it was! Only a tiny black ring - like an insignificant puff of \par
smoke, giving no hint of the cyclonic fury that must be blasting its way \par
outwards from the point of impact. As Poole watched, it slowly expanded, though \par
owing to its scale there was no sense of visible movement: he had to wait for a \par
full minute before he could be quite sure that it had grown larger.\par
\par
    After a quarter of an hour, however, it was the most prominent marking on \par
the planet. Though much fainter - a dirty grey, rather than black - the \par
shockwave was now a ragged circle more than a thousand kilometres across. Poole \par
guessed that it had lost its original symmetry while sweeping over the great \par
mountain ranges that lay beneath it.\par
\par
    Captain Chandler's voice sounded briskly over the ship's address system.\par
\par
    'Putting you through to Aphrodite Base. Glad to say they're not shouting for \par
help -'\par
\par
    '- shook us up a bit, but just what we expected. Monitors indicate some rain \par
already over the Nokomis Mountains - it will soon evaporate, but that's a \par
beginning. And there seems to have been a flash-flood in Hecate Chasm - too good \par
to be true, but we're checking. There was a temporary lake of boiling water \par
there after the last delivery -'\par
\par
    I don't envy them, Poole told himself - but I certainly admire them. They \par
prove that the spirit of adventure still exists in this perhaps too-comfortable \par
and too-well-adjusted society.\par
\par
    '- and thanks again for bringing this little load down in the right place. \par
With any luck - and if we can get that sun-screen up into sync orbit - we'll \par
have some permanent seas before long. And then we can plant coral reefs, to make \par
lime and pull the excess CO2 out of the atmosphere - hope I live to see it!'\par
\par
    I hope you do, thought Poole in silent admiration. He had often dived in the \par
tropical seas of Earth, admiring weird and colourful creatures so bizarre that \par
it was hard to believe anything stranger would be found, even on the planets of \par
other suns.\par
\par
    'Package delivered on time, and receipt acknowledged,' said Captain Chandler \par
with obvious satisfaction. 'Goodbye Venus - Ganymede, here we come.'\par
\par
    \par
\par
    MISS PRINGLE\par
\par
    FILE WALLACE\par
\par
    Hello, Indra. Yes, you were quite right. I do miss our little arguments. \par
Chandler and I get along fine, and at first the crew treated me - this will \par
amuse you - rather like a holy relic. But they're beginning to accept me, and \par
have even started to pull my leg (do you know that idiom?).\par
\par
    It's annoying not to be able to have a real conversation - we've crossed the \par
orbit of Mars, so radio round-trip is already over an hour. But there's one \par
advantage - you won't be able to interrupt me...\par
\par
    Even though it will take us only a week to reach Jupiter, I thought I'd have \par
time to relax. Not a bit of it: my fingers started to itch, and I couldn't \par
resist going back to school. So I've begun basic training, all over again, in \par
one of Goliath's minishuttles. Maybe Dim will actually let me solo...\par
\par
    It's not much bigger than Discovery's pods - but what a difference! First of \par
all, of course, it doesn't use rockets: I can't get used to the luxury of the \par
inertial drive, and unlimited range. Could fly back to Earth if I had to - \par
though I'd probably get - remember the phrase I used once, and you guessed its \par
meaning? - 'stir crazy'.\par
\par
    The biggest difference, though, is the control system. It's been a big \par
challenge for me to get used to hands-off operation - and the computer has had \par
to learn to recognize my voice commands. At first it was asking every five \par
minutes 'Do you really mean that?' I know it would be better to use the Braincap \par
- but I'm still not completely confident with that gadget. Not sure if I'll ever \par
get used to something reading my mind.\par
\par
    By the way, the shuttle's called Falcon. It's a nice name - and I was \par
disappointed to find that no one aboard knew that it goes all the way back to \par
the Apollo missions, when we first landed on the Moon...\par
\par
    Uh-huh - there was a lot more I wanted to say, but the skipper is calling. \par

    Hello Frank - here I am again. Still waiting acknowledgement of my last...\par
\par
    Strange you should be heading towards Ganymede, and my old friend Ted Khan. \par
But perhaps it's not such a coincidence: he was drawn by the same enigma that \par
you were...\par
\par
    First I must tell you something about him. His parents played a dirty trick, \par
giving him the name Theodore. That shortens - don't ever call him that! - to \par
Theo. See what I mean?\par
\par
    Can't help wondering if that's what drives him. Don't know anyone else who's \par
developed such an interest in religion - no, obsession. Better warn you; he can \par
be quite a bore.\par
\par
    By the way, how am I doing? I miss my old Thinkwriter, but seem to be \par
getting this machine under control. Haven't made any bad - what did you call \par
them? - bloopers - glitches - fluffs - so far at least - Not sure I should tell \par
you this, in case you accidentally blurt it out, but my private nickname for Ted \par
is 'The Last Jesuit'. You must know something about them - the Order was still \par
very active in your time.\par
\par
    Amazing people - often great scientists - superb scholars - did a tremendous \par
amount of good as well as much harm. One of history's supreme ironies - sincere \par
and brilliant seekers of knowledge and truth, yet their whole philosophy \par
hopelessly distorted by superstition...\par

\par
    Damn. Got emotional and lost control. One, two, three, four... now is the \par

\par
    Anyway, Ted has that same brand of high-minded determination; don't get into \par
any arguments with him - he'll go over you like a steam-roller.\par
\par
    By the way what were steam-rollers? Used for pressing clothes? Can see how \par
that could be very uncomfortable...\par
\par
    Trouble with Thinkwriters... too easy to go off in all directions, no matter \par
how hard you try to discipline yourself... something to be said for keyboards \par
after all... sure I've said that before...\par
\par
    Ted Khan... Ted Khan... Ted Khan\par
\par
    He's still famous back on Earth for at least two of his sayings: \par
'Civilization and Religion are incompatible' and 'Faith is believing what you \par
know isn't true'. Actually, I don't think the last one is original; if it is, \par
that's the nearest he ever got to a joke. He never cracked a smile when I tried \par
one of my favourites on him - hope you haven't heard it before. It obviously \par
dates from your time.\par
\par
    The Dean's complaining to his Faculty. 'Why do you scientists need such \par
expensive equipment? Why can't you be like the Maths Department, which only \par
needs a blackboard and a waste-paper basket? Better still, like the Department \par
of Philosophy. That doesn't even need a wastepaper basket...' Well, perhaps Ted \par
had heard it before... I expect most philosophers have...\par

16\par
The Captain's Table\par
\par
    \par
\par
    The arrival of such a distinguished passenger had caused a certain \par
disruption in the tight little world of Goliath, but the crew had adapted to it \par
with good humour. Every day, at 18.00 hours, all personnel gathered for dinner \par
in the wardroom, which in zero-gee could hold at least thirty people in comfort, \par
if spread uniformly around the walls. However, most of the time the ship's \par
working areas were held at lunar gravity, so there was an undeniable floor - and \par
more than eight bodies made a crowd.\par
\par
    The semi-circular table that unfolded around the auto-chef at mealtimes \par
could just seat the entire seven-person crew, with the Captain at the place of \par
honour. One extra created such insuperable problems that somebody now had to eat \par
alone for every meal. After much good-natured debate, it was decided to make the \par
choice in alphabetical order - not of proper names, which were hardly ever used, \par
but of nicknames. It had taken Poole some time to get used to them: 'Bolts' \par
(structural engineering); 'Chips' (computers and communications); 'First' (First \par
Mate); 'Life' (medical and life-support systems); 'Props' (propulsion and \par
power); and 'Stars' (orbits and navigation).\par
\par
    During the ten-day voyage, as he listened to the stories, jokes and \par
complaints of his temporary shipmates, Poole learned more about the solar system \par
than during his months on Earth. All aboard were obviously delighted to have a \par
new and perhaps na\'efve listener as an attentive one-man audience, but Poole was \par
seldom taken in by their more imaginative stories.\par
\par
    Yet sometimes it was hard to know where to draw the line. No one really \par
believed in the Golden Asteroid, which was usually regarded as a twenty-fourth-\par
century hoax. But what about the Mercurian plasmoids, which had been reported by \par
at least a dozen reliable witnesses during the last five hundred years?\par
\par
    The simplest explanation was that they were related to ball-lightning, \par
responsible for so many 'Unidentified Flying Object' reports on Earth and Mars. \par
But some observers swore that they had shown purposefulness - even \par
inquisitiveness - when they were encountered at close quarters. Nonsense, \par
answered the sceptics - merely electrostatic attraction!\par
\par
    Inevitably, this led to discussions about life in the Universe, and Poole \par
found himself - not for the first time -defending his own era against its \par
extremes of credulity and scepticism. Although the 'Aliens are among us' mania \par
had already subsided when he was a boy, even as late as the 2020s the Space \par
Agency was still plagued by lunatics who claimed to have been contacted - or \par
abducted - by visitors from other worlds. Their delusions had been reinforced by \par
sensational media exploitation, and the whole syndrome was later enshrined in \par
the medical literature as 'Adamski's Disease'.\par
\par
    The discovery of TMA ONE had, paradoxically, put an end to this sorry \par
nonsense, by demonstrating that though there was indeed intelligence elsewhere, \par
it had apparently not concerned itself with Mankind for several million years. \par
TMA ONE had also convincingly refuted the handful of scientists who argued that \par
life above the bacterial level was such an improbable phenomenon that the human \par
race was alone in this Galaxy - if not the Cosmos.\par
\par
    Goliath's crew was more interested in the technology than the politics and \par
economics of Poole's era, and were particularly fascinated by the revolution \par
that had taken place in his own lifetime - the end of the fossil-fuel age, \par
triggered by the harnessing of vacuum energy. They found it hard to imagine the \par
smog-choked cities of the twentieth century, and the waste, greed and appalling \par
environmental disasters of the Oil Age.\par
\par
    'Don't blame me,' said Poole, fighting back gamely after one round of \par
criticism. 'Anyway, see what a mess the twenty-first century made.'\par
\par
    There was a chorus of 'What do you mean?'s around the table.\par
\par
    'Well, as soon as the so-called Age of Infinite Power got under way, and \par
everyone had thousands of kilowatts of cheap, clean energy to play with - you \par
know what happened!'\par
\par
    'Oh, you mean the Thermal Crisis. But that was fixed.'\par
\par
    'Eventually - after you'd covered half the Earth with reflectors to bounce \par
the Sun's heat back into space. Otherwise it would have been as parboiled as \par
Venus by now.'\par
\par
    The crew's knowledge of Third Millennium history was so surprisingly limited \par
that Poole - thanks to the intensive education he had received in Star City - \par
could often amaze them with details of events centuries after his own time. \par
However, he was flattered to discover how well-acquainted they were with \par
Discovery's log, it had become one of the classic records of the Space Age. They \par
looked on it as he might have regarded a Viking saga; often he had to remind \par
himself that he was midway in time between Goliath and the first ships to cross \par
the western ocean...\par
\par
    'On your Day 86,' Stars reminded him, at dinner on the fifth evening, 'you \par
passed within two thousand kay of asteroid 7794 - and shot a probe into it. Do \par
you remember?"\par
\par
    'Of course I do,' Poole answered rather brusquely 'To me, it happened less \par
than a year ago'\par
\par
    'Um, sorry. Well, tomorrow we'll be even closer to 13,445. Like to have a \par
look?' With autoguidance and freeze-frame, we should have a window all of ten \par
milliseconds wide.'\par
\par
    A hundredth of a second! That few minutes in Discovery had seemed hectic \par
enough, but now everything would happen fifty times faster.\par
\par
    'How large is it?' Poole asked.\par
\par
    'Thirty by twenty by fifteen metres,' Stars replied. 'Looks like a battered \par
brick.'\par
\par
    'Sorry we don't have a slug to fire at it,' said Props. 'Did you ever wonder \par
if 7794 would hit back?'\par
\par
    'Never occurred to us. But it did give the astronomers a lot of useful \par
information, so it was worth the risk... Anyway, a hundredth of a second hardly \par
seems worth the bother. Thanks all the same.'\par
\par
    'I understand. When you've seen one asteroid, you've seen them -'\par
\par
    'Not true, Chips. When I was on Eros -'\par
\par
    'As you've told us at least a dozen times -, Poole's mind tuned out the \par
discussion, so that it was a background of meaningless noise. He was a thousand \par
years in the past, recalling the only excitement of Discovery's mission before \par
the final disaster. Though he and Bowman were perfectly aware that 7794 was \par
merely a lifeless, airless chunk of rock, that knowledge scarcely affected their \par
feelings. It was the only solid matter they would meet this side of Jupiter, and \par
they had stared at it with the emotions of sailors on a long sea voyage, \par
skirting a coast on which they could not land.\par
\par
    It was turning slowly end over end, and there were mottled patches of light \par
and shade distributed at random over its surface. Sometimes it sparkled like a \par
distant window, as planes or outcroppings of crystalline material flashed in the \par
Sun...\par
\par
    He remembered, also, the mounting tension as they waited to see if their aim \par
had been accurate. It was not easy to hit such a small target, two thousand \par
kilometres away, moving at a relative velocity of twenty kilometres a second.\par
\par
    Then, against the darkened portion of the asteroid, there had been a sudden, \par
dazzling explosion of light. The tiny slug - pure Uranium 238 - had impacted at \par
meteoric speed: in a fraction of a second, all its kinetic energy had been \par
transformed into heat. A puff of incandescent gas had erupted briefly into \par
space, and Discovery's cameras were recording the rapidly fading spectral lines, \par
looking for the tell-tale signatures of glowing atoms. A few hours later, back \par
on Earth, the astronomers learned for the first time the composition of an \par
asteroid's crust. There were no major surprises, but several bottles of \par
champagne changed hands.\par
\par
    Captain Chandler himself took little part in the very democratic discussions \par
around his semi-circular table: he seemed content to let his crew relax and \par
express their feelings in this informal atmosphere. There was only one unspoken \par
rule: no serious business at mealtimes. If there were any technical or \par
operational problems, they had to be dealt with elsewhere.\par
\par
    Poole had been surprised - and a little shocked - to discover that the \par
crew's knowledge of Goliath's systems was very superficial. Often he had asked \par
questions which should have been easily answered, only to be referred to the \par
ship's own memory banks. After a while, however, he realized that the sort of \par
in-depth training he had received in his days was no longer possible: far too \par
many complex systems were involved for any man or woman's mind to master. The \par
various specialists merely had to know what their equipment did, not how. \par
Reliability depended on redundancy and automatic checking, and human \par
intervention was much more likely to do harm than good.\par
\par
    Fortunately none was required on this voyage: it had been as uneventful as \par
any skipper could have hoped, when the new sun of Lucifer dominated the sky \par
ahead.\par

III\par
THE WORLDS OF GALILEO\par
\par
    \par
\par
    (Extract, text only, Tourist's Guide to Outer Solar System, v 219.3)\par
\par
    \par
\par
    Even today, the giant satellites of what was once Jupiter present us with \par
major mysteries. Why are four worlds, orbiting the same primary and very similar \par
in size, so different in most other respects?\par
\par
    Only in the case of Io, the innermost satellite, is there a convincing \par
explanation. It is so close to Jupiter that the gravitational tides constantly \par
kneading its interior generate colossal quantities of heat - so much, indeed, \par
that Io's surface is semi-molten. It is the most volcanically active world in \par
the Solar System; maps of Io have a half-life of only a few decades.\par
\par
    Though no permanent human bases have ever been established in such an \par
unstable environment, there have been numerous landings and there is continuous \par
robot monitoring. (For the tragic fate of the 2571 Expedition, see Beagle 5.)\par
\par
    Europa, second in distance from Jupiter, was originally entirely covered in \par
ice, and showed few surface features except a complicated network of cracks. The \par
tidal forces which dominate Io were much less powerful here, but produced enough \par
heat to give Europa a global ocean of liquid water, in which many strange life-\par
forms have evolved.\par
\par
    In 2010 the Chinese ship Tsien touched down on Europa on one of the few \par
outcrops of solid rock protruding through the crust of ice. In doing so it \par
disturbed a creature of the Europan abyss and was destroyed (see Spacecraft \par
Tsien, Galaxy, Universe).\par
\par
    Since the conversion of Jupiter into the mini-sun Lucifer in 2061, virtually \par
all of Europa's ice-cover has melted, and extensive vulcanism has created \par
several small islands.\par
\par
    As is well-known, there have been no landings on Europa for almost a \par
thousand years, but the satellite is under continuous surveillance.\par
\par
    Ganymede, largest moon in the Solar System (diameter 5260 kilometres), has \par
also been affected by the creation of a new sun, and its equatorial regions are \par
warm enough to sustain terrestrial life-forms, though it does not yet have a \par
breathable atmosphere. Most of its population is actively engaged in \par
terraforming and scientific research; the main settlement is Anubis (pop \par
41,000), near the South Pole.\par
\par
    Callisto is again wholly different. Its entire surface is covered by impact \par
craters of all sizes, so numerous that they overlap. The bombardment must have \par
continued for millions of years, for the newer craters have completely \par
obliterated the earlier ones. There is no permanent base on Callisto, but \par
several automatic stations have been established there.\par
\par
    \par
\par
17\par
Ganymede\par
\par
    \par
\par
    It was unusual for Frank Poole to oversleep, but he had been kept awake by \par
strange dreams. Past and present were inextricably mixed; sometimes he was on \par
Discovery, sometimes in the Africa Tower - and sometimes he was a boy again, \par
among friends he had thought long-forgotten.\par
\par
    Where am I? he asked himself as he struggled up to consciousness, like a \par
swimmer trying to get back to the surface. There was a small window just above \par
his bed, covered by a curtain not thick enough to completely block the light \par
from outside. There had been a time, around the mid-twentieth century, when \par
aircraft had been slow enough to feature First Class sleeping accommodation: \par
Poole had never sampled this nostalgic luxury, which some tourist organizations \par
had still advertised in his own day, but he could easily imagine that he was \par
doing so now.\par
\par
    He drew the curtain and looked out. No, he had not awakened in the skies of \par
Earth, though the landscape unrolling below was not unlike the Antarctic. But \par
the South Pole had never boasted two suns, both rising at once as Goliath swept \par
towards them.\par
\par
    The ship was orbiting less than a hundred kilometres above what appeared to \par
be an immense ploughed field, lightly dusted with snow. But the ploughman must \par
have been drunk - or the guidance system must have gone crazy - for the furrows \par
meandered in every direction, sometimes cutting across each other or turning \par
back on themselves. Here and there the terrain was dotted with faint circles -\par
ghost craters from meteor impacts aeons ago.\par
\par
    So this is Ganymede, Poole wondered drowsily. Mankind's furthest outpost \par
from home! Why should any sensible person want to live here? Well, I've often \par
thought that when I've flown over Greenland or Iceland in winter-time...\par
\par
    There was a knock on the door, a 'Mind if I come in?', and Captain Chandler \par
did so without waiting for a reply.\par
\par
    'Thought we'd let you sleep until we landed - that end-of-trip party did \par
last longer than I'd intended, but I couldn't risk a mutiny by cutting it \par
short.'\par
\par
    Poole laughed.\par
\par
    'Has there ever been a mutiny in space?'\par
\par
    'Oh, quite a few but not in my time. Now we've mentioned the subject, you \par
might say that Hal started the tradition... sorry - perhaps I shouldn't - look - \par
there's Ganymede City!'\par
\par
    Coming up over the horizon was what appeared to be a criss-cross pattern of \par
streets and avenues, intersecting almost at right-angles but with the slight \par
irregularity typical of any settlement that had grown by accretion, without \par
central planning. It was bisected by a broad river - Poole recalled that the \par
equatorial regions of Ganymede were now warm enough for liquid water to exist - \par
and it reminded him of an old wood-cut he had seen of medieval London.\par
\par
    Then he noticed that Chandler was looking at him with an expression of \par
amusement... and the illusion vanished as he realized the scale of the 'city'.\par
\par
    'The Ganymedeans,' he said dryly, 'must have been rather large, to have made \par
roads five or ten kilometres wide.'\par
\par
    'Twenty in some places. Impressive, isn't it? And all the result of ice \par
stretching and contracting. Mother Nature is ingenious... I could show you some \par
patterns that look even more artificial, though they're not as large as this \par
one.'\par
\par
    'When I was a boy, there was a big fuss about a face on Mars. Of course, it \par
turned out to be a hill that had been carved by sand-storms... lots of similar \par
ones in Earth's deserts.'\par
\par
    'Didn't someone say that history always repeats itself? Same sort of \par
nonsense happened with Ganymede City - some nuts claimed it had been built by \par
aliens. But I'm afraid it won't be around much longer.'\par
\par
    'Why?' asked Poole in surprise.\par
\par
    'It's already started to collapse, as Lucifer melts the permafrost. You \par
won't recognize Ganymede in another hundred years... there's the edge of Lake \par
Gilgamesh - if you look carefully - over on the right-'\par
\par
    'I see what you mean. What's happening - surely the water's not boiling, \par
even at this low pressure?'\par
\par
    'Electrolysis plant. Don't know how many skillions of kilograms of oxygen a \par
day. Of course, the hydrogen goes up and gets lost - we hope.'\par
\par
    Chandler's voice trailed off into silence. Then he resumed, in an unusually \par
diffident tone: 'All that beautiful water down there - Ganymede doesn't need \par
half of it! Don't tell anyone, but I've been working out ways of getting some to \par
Venus.'\par
\par
    'Easier than nudging comets?'\par
\par
    'As far as energy is concerned, yes - Ganymede's escape velocity is only \par
three klicks per second. And much, much quicker - years instead of decades. But \par
there are a few practical difficulties..\par
\par
    'I can appreciate that. Would you shoot it off by a mass-launcher?'\par
\par
    'Oh no - I'd use towers reaching up through the atmosphere, like the ones on \par
Earth, but much smaller. We'd pump the water up to the top, freeze it down to \par
near absolute zero, and let Ganymede sling it off in the right direction as it \par
rotated. There would be some evaporation loss in transit, but most of it would \par
arrive - what's so funny?'\par
\par
    'Sorry - I'm not laughing at the idea - it makes good sense. But you've \par
brought back such a vivid memory. We used to have a garden sprinkler - driven \par
round and round by its water jets. What you're planning is the same thing - on a \par
slightly bigger scale... using a whole world...'\par
\par
    Suddenly, another image from his past obliterated all else. Poole remembered \par
how, in those hot Arizona days, he and Rikki had loved to chase each other \par
through the clouds of moving mist, from the slowly revolving spray of the garden \par
sprinkler.\par
\par
    Captain Chandler was a much more sensitive man than he pretended to be: he \par
knew when it was time to leave.\par
\par
    'Gotta get back to the bridge,' he said gruffly. 'See you when we land at \par
Anubis.'\par
\par
    \par
\par
18\par
Grand Hotel\par
\par
    \par
\par
    The Grand Ganymede Hotel - inevitably known throughout the Solar System as \par
'Hotel Grannymede' was certainly not grand, and would be lucky to get a rating \par
of one-and-a-half stars on Earth. As the nearest competition was several hundred \par
million kilometres away, the management felt little need to exert itself unduly.\par
\par
    Yet Poole had no complaints, though he often wished that Danil was still \par
around, to help him with the mechanics of life and to communicate more \par
efficiently with the semi-intelligent devices with which he was surrounded. He \par
had known a brief moment of panic when the door had closed behind the (human) \par
bellboy, who had apparently been too awed by his guest to explain how any of the \par
room's services functioned. After five minutes of fruitless talking to the \par
unresponsive walls, Poole had finally made contact with a system that understood \par
his accent and his commands. What an 'All Worlds' news item it would have made - \par
'Historic astronaut starves to death, trapped in Ganymede hotel room'!\par
\par
    And there would have been a double irony. Perhaps the naming of the \par
Grannymede's only luxury suite was inevitable, but it had been a real shock to \par
meet an ancient life-size holo of his old shipmate, in full-dress uniform, as he \par
was led into - the Bowman Suite. Poole even recognized the image: his own \par
official portrait had been made at the same time, a few days before the mission \par
began.\par
\par
    He soon discovered that most of his Goliath crewmates had domestic \par
arrangements in Anubis, and were anxious for him to meet their Significant \par
Others during the ship's planned twenty-day stop. Almost immediately he was \par
caught up in the social and professional life of this frontier settlement, and \par
it was Africa Tower that now seemed a distant dream.\par
\par
    Like many Americans, in their secret hearts, Poole had a nostalgic affection \par
for small communities where everyone knew everyone else - in the real world, and \par
not the virtual one of cyberspace. Anubis, with a resident population less than \par
that of his remembered Flagstaff, was not a bad approximation to this ideal.\par
\par
    The three main pressure domes, each two kilometres in diameter, stood on a \par
plateau overlooking an ice-field which stretched unbroken to the horizon. \par
Ganymede's second sun\par
\par
    - once known as Jupiter - would never give sufficient heat to melt the polar \par
caps. This was the principal reason for establishing Anubis in such an \par
inhospitable spot: the city's foundations were not likely to collapse for at \par
least several centuries.\par
\par
    And inside the domes, it was easy to be completely indifferent to the \par
outside world. Poole, when he had mastered the mechanisms of the Bowman Suite, \par
discovered that he had a limited but impressive choice of environments. He could \par
sit beneath palm trees on a Pacific beach, listening to the gentle murmur of the \par
waves - or, if he preferred, the roar of a tropical hurricane. He could fly \par
slowly along the peaks of the Himalayas, or down the immense canyons of Mariner \par
Valley. He could walk through the gardens of Versailles or down the streets of \par
half a dozen great cities, at several widely spaced times in their history. Even \par
if the Hotel Grannymede was not one of the Solar System's most highly acclaimed \par
resorts, it boasted facilities which would have astounded all its more famous \par
predecessors on Earth.\par
\par
    But it was ridiculous to indulge in terrestrial nostalgia, when he had come \par
half-way across the Solar System to visit a strange new world. After some \par
experimenting, Poole arranged a compromise, for enjoyment - and inspiration -\par
during his steadily fewer moments of leisure.\par
\par
    To his great regret, he had never been to Egypt, so it was delightful to \par
relax beneath the gaze of the Sphinx - as it was before its controversial \par
'restoration' - and to watch tourists scrambling up the massive blocks of the \par
Great Pyramid. The illusion was perfect, apart from the no-man's-land where the \par
desert clashed with the (slightly worn) carpet of the Bowman Suite.\par
\par
    The sky, however, was one that no human eyes had seen until five thousand \par
years after the last stone was laid at Giza. But it was not an illusion; it was \par
the complex and ever-changing reality of Ganymede.\par
\par
    Because this world - like its companions - had been robbed of its spin aeons \par
ago by the tidal drag of Jupiter, the new sun born from the giant planet hung \par
motionless in its sky. One side of Ganymede was in perpetual Lucifer-light - and \par
although the other hemisphere was often referred to as the 'Night Land', that \par
designation was as misleading as the much earlier phrase 'The dark side of the \par
Moon'. Like the lunar Farside, Ganymede's 'Night Land' had the brilliant light \par
of old Sol for half of its long day.\par
\par
    By a coincidence more confusing than useful, Ganymede took almost exactly \par
one week - seven days, three hours -to orbit its primary. Attempts to create a \par
'One Mede day = one Earth week' calendar had generated so much chaos that they \par
had been abandoned centuries ago. Like all the other residents of the Solar \par
System, the locals employed Universal Time, identifying their twenty-four-hour \par
standard days by numbers rather than names.\par
\par
    Since Ganymede's newborn atmosphere was still extremely thin and almost \par
cloudless, the parade of heavenly bodies provided a never-ending spectacle. At \par
their closest, Io and Callisto each appeared about half the size of the Moon as \par
seen from Earth - but that was the only thing they had in common. Io was so \par
close to Lucifer that it took less than two days to race around its orbit, and \par
showed visible movement even in a matter of minutes. Callisto, at over four \par
times Io's distance, required two Mede days - or sixteen Earth ones - to \par
complete its leisurely circuit.\par
\par
    The physical contrast between the two worlds was even more remarkable. Deep-\par
frozen Callisto had been almost unchanged by Jupiter's conversion into a mini-\par
sun: it was still a wasteland of shallow ice craters, so closely packed that \par
there was not a single spot on the entire satellite that had escaped from \par
multiple impacts, in the days when Jupiter's enormous gravity field was \par
competing with Saturn's to gather up the debris of the outer Solar System. Since \par
then, apart from a few stray shots, nothing had happened for several billion \par
years.\par
\par
    On Io, something was happening every week. As a local wit had remarked, \par
before the creation of Lucifer it had been Hell - now it was Hell warmed up.\par
\par
    Often, Poole would zoom into that burning landscape and look into the \par
sulphurous throats of volcanoes that were continually reshaping an area larger \par
than Africa. Sometimes incandescent fountains would soar briefly hundreds of \par
kilometres into space, like gigantic trees of fire growing on a lifeless world.\par
\par
    As the floods of molten sulphur spread out from volcanoes and vents, the \par
versatile element changed through a narrow spectrum of reds and oranges and \par
yellows when, chameleon-like, it was transformed into its vari-coloured \par
allotropes. Before the dawn of the Space Age, no one had ever imagined that such \par
a world existed. Fascinating though it was to observe it from his comfortable \par
vantage point, Poole found it hard to believe that men had ever risked landing \par
there, where even robots feared to tread... His main interest, however, was \par
Europa, which at its closest appeared almost exactly the same size as Earth's \par
solitary Moon, but raced through its phases in only four days. Though Poole had \par
been quite unconscious of the symbolism when he chose his private landscape, it \par
now seemed wholly appropriate that Europa should hang in the sky above another \par
great enigma - the Sphinx.\par
\par
    Even with no magnification, when he requested the naked-eye view, Poole \par
could see how greatly Europa had changed in the thousand years since Discovery \par
had set out for Jupiter. The spider's web of narrow bands and lines that had \par
once completely enveloped the smallest of the four Galilean satellites had \par
vanished, except around the poles. Here the global crust of kilometre-thick ice \par
remained unmelted by the warmth of Europa's new sun: elsewhere, virgin oceans \par
seethed and boiled in the thin atmosphere, at what would have been comfortable \par
room temperature on Earth.\par
\par
    It was also a comfortable temperature to the creatures who had emerged, \par
after the melting of the unbroken ice shield that had both trapped and protected \par
them. Orbiting spysats, showing details only centimetres across, had watched one \par
Europan species starting to evolve into an amphibious stage: though they still \par
spent much of their time underwater, the 'Europs' had even begun the \par
construction of simple buildings.\par
\par
    That this could happen in a mere thousand years was astonishing, but no one \par
doubted that the explanation lay in the last and greatest of the Monoliths - the \par
many-kilometre-long 'Great Wall' standing on the shore of the Sea of Galilee.\par
\par
    And no one doubted that, in its own mysterious way, it was watching over the \par
experiment it had started on this world - as it had done on Earth four million \par
years before.\par

The Madness of Mankind\par
\par
    \par
\par
    MISS PRINGLE\par
\par
    FILE INDRA\par
\par
    My dear Indra - sorry I've not even voice-mailed you before - usual excuse, \par
of course, so I won't bother to give it.\par
\par
    To answer your question - yes, I'm now feeling quite at home at the \par
Grannymede, but am spending less and less time there, though I've been enjoying \par
the sky display I've had piped into my suite. Last night the Io flux-tube put on \par
a fine performance - that's a kind of lightning discharge between Io and Jupiter \par
- I mean Lucifer. Rather like Earth's aurora, but much more spectacular. \par
Discovered by the radio astronomers even before I was born.\par
\par
    And talking about ancient times - did you know that Anubis has a Sheriff? I \par
think that's overdoing the frontier spirit. Reminds me of the stories my \par
grandfather used to tell me about Arizona... Must try some of them on the \par
Medes...\par
\par
    This may sound silly - I'm still not used to being in the Bowman Suite. I \par
keep looking over my shoulder...\par
\par
    How do I spend my time? Much the same as in Africa Tower. I'm meeting the \par
local intelligentsia, though as you might expect they're rather thin on the \par
ground (hope no one is bugging this). And I've interacted - real and virtual - \par
with the educational system - very good, it seems, though more technically \par
oriented than you'd approve. That's inevitable, of course, in this hostile \par
environment...\par
\par
    But it's helped me to understand why people live here. There's a challenge - \par
a sense of purpose, if you like - that I seldom found on Earth.\par
\par
    It's true that most of the Medes were born here, so don't know any other \par
home. Though they're - usually - too polite to say so, they think that the Home \par
Planet is becoming decadent. Are you? And if so, what are you Terries -  as the \par
locals call you - going to do about it? One of the teenage classes I've met \par
hopes to wake you up. They're drawing up elaborate Top Secret plans for the \par
Invasion of Earth. Don't say I didn't warn you...\par
\par
    I've made one trip outside Anubis, into the so-called Night Land, where they \par
never see Lucifer. Ten of us -Chandler, two of Goliath's crew, six Medes - went \par
into Farside, and chased the Sun down to the horizon so it really was night. \par
Awesome - much like polar winters on Earth, but with the sky completely black... \par
almost felt I was in space.\par
\par
    We could see all the Galileans beautifully, and watched Europa eclipse - \par
sorry, occult - Io. Of course, the trip had been timed so we could observe \par
this...\par
\par
    Several of the smaller satellites were just also visible, but the double \par
star Earth-Moon was much more conspicuous. Did I feel homesick? Frankly, no - \par
though I miss my new friends back there...\par
\par
    And I'm sorry - I still haven't met Dr Khan, though he's left several \par
messages for me. I promise to do it in the next few days - Earth days, not Mede \par
ones!\par
\par
    Best wishes to Joe - regards to Danil, if you know what's happened to him - \par
is he a real person again? - and my love to yourself.\par
\par
    STORE TRANSMIT\par
\par
    \par
\par
    Back in Poole's century, a person's name often gave a clue to his/her \par
appearance, but that was no longer true thirty generations later. Dr Theodore \par
Khan turned out to be a Nordic blond who might have looked more at home in a \par
Viking longboat than ravaging the steppes of Central Asia: however, he would not \par
have been too impressive in either role, being less than a hundred and fifty \par
centimetres tall. Poole could not resist a little amateur psychoanalysis: small \par
people were often aggressive over-achievers - which, from Indra Wallace's hints, \par
appeared to be a good description of Ganymede's sole resident philosopher. Khan \par
probably needed these qualifications, to survive in such a practically-minded \par
society.\par
\par
    Anubis City was far too small to boast a university campus - a luxury which \par
still existed on the other worlds, though many believed that the \par
telecommunications revolution had made it obsolete. Instead, it had something \par
much more appropriate, as well as centuries older - an Academy, complete with a \par
grove of olive trees that would have fooled Plato himself, until he had \par
attempted to walk through it. Indra's joke about departments of philosophy \par
requiring no more equipment than blackboards clearly did not apply in this \par
sophisticated environment.\par
\par
    'It's built to hold seven people,' said Dr Khan proudly, when they had \par
settled down on chairs obviously designed to be not-too-comfortable, 'because \par
that's the maximum one can efficiently interact with. And, if you count the \par
ghost of Socrates, it was the number present when Phaedo delivered his famous \par
address...'\par
\par
    'The one on the immortality of the soul?'\par
\par
    Khan was so obviously surprised that Poole could not help laughing.\par
\par
    'I took a crash course in philosophy just before I graduated - when the \par
syllabus was planned, someone decided that we hairy-knuckled engineers should be \par
exposed to a little culture.'\par
\par
    'I'm delighted to hear it. That makes things so much easier. You know - I \par
still can't credit my luck. Your arrival here almost tempts me to believe in \par
miracles! I'd even thought of going to Earth to meet you - has dear Indra told \par
you about my - ah - obsession?'\par
\par
    'No,' Poole answered, not altogether truthfully.\par
\par
    Dr Khan looked very pleased; he was clearly delighted to find a new \par
audience.\par
\par
    'You may have heard me called an atheist, but that's not quite true. Atheism \par
is unprovable, so uninteresting. Equally, however unlikely it is, we can never \par
be certain that God once existed - and has now shot off to infinity, where no \par
one can ever find him... Like Gautama Buddha, I take no position on this \par
subject. My field of interest is the psychopathology known as Religion.'\par
\par
    'Psychopathology? That's a harsh judgement.'\par
\par
    'Amply justified by history. Imagine that you're an intelligent \par
extraterrestrial, concerned only with verifiable truths. You discover a species \par
which has divided itself into thousands - no by now millions - of tribal groups \par
holding an incredible variety of beliefs about the origin of the universe and \par
the way to behave in it. Although many of them have ideas in common, even when \par
there's a ninety-nine per cent overlap, the remaining one per cent is enough to \par
set them killing and torturing each other, over trivial points of doctrine, \par
utterly meaningless to outsiders.'\par
\par
    'How to account for such irrational behaviour? Lucretius hit it on the nail \par
when he said that religion was the by-product of fear - a reaction to a \par
mysterious and often hostile universe. For much of human prehistory, it may have \par
been a necessary evil - but why was it so much more evil than necessary - and \par
why did it survive when it was no longer necessary?\par
\par
    'I said evil - and I mean it, because fear leads to cruelty. The slightest \par
knowledge of the Inquisition makes one ashamed to belong to the human species... \par
One of the most revolting books ever published was the Hammer of Witches, \par
written by a couple of sadistic perverts and describing the tortures the Church \par
authorized - encouraged! - to extract "confessions" from thousands of harmless \par
old women, before it burned them alive... The Pope himself wrote an approving \par
foreword!'\par
\par
    'But most of the other religions, with a few honourable exceptions, were \par
just as bad as Christianity... Even in your century, little boys were kept \par
chained and whipped until they'd memorized whole volumes of pious gibberish, and \par
robbed of their childhood and manhood to become monks...'\par
\par
    'Perhaps the most baffling aspect of the whole affair is how obvious madmen, \par
century after century, would proclaim that they - and they alone! - had received \par
messages from God. If all the messages had agreed, that would have settled the \par
matter. But of course they were wildly discordant - which never prevented self-\par
styled messiahs from gathering hundreds - sometimes millions - of adherents, who \par
would fight to the death against equally deluded believers of a microscopically \par
differing faith.'\par
\par
    Poole thought it was about time he got a word in edgeways.\par
\par
    'You've reminded me of something that happened in my home-town when I was a \par
kid. A holy man - quote, unquote - set up shop, claimed he could work miracles - \par
and collected a crowd of devotees in next to no time. And they weren't ignorant \par
or illiterate; often they came from the best families. Every Sunday I used to \par
see expensive cars parked round his - ah - temple.'\par
\par
    'The "Rasputin Syndrome", it's been called: there are millions of such \par
cases, all through history, in every country. And about one time in a thousand \par
the cult survives for a couple of generations. What happened in this case?'\par
\par
    'Well, the competition was very unhappy, and did its best to discredit him. \par
Wish I could remember his name - he used a long Indian one - Swami something-or-\par
other - but it turned out he came from Alabama. One of his tricks was to produce \par
holy objects out of thin air, and hand them to his worshippers. As it happened, \par
our local rabbi was an amateur conjuror, and gave public demonstrations showing \par
exactly how it was done. Didn't make the slightest difference - the faithful \par
said that their man's magic was real, and the rabbi was just jealous.'\par
\par
    'At one time, I'm sorry to say, Mother took the rascal seriously - it was \par
soon after Dad had run off, which may have had something to do with it - and \par
dragged me to one of his sessions. I was only about ten, but I thought I'd never \par
seen anyone so unpleasant-looking. He had a beard that could have held several \par
birds' nests, and probably did.'\par
\par
    'He sounds like the standard model. How long did he flourish?'\par
\par
    'Three or four years. And then he had to leave town in a hurry: he was \par
caught running teenage orgies. Of course, he claimed he was using mystical soul-\par
saving techniques. And you won't believe this -,\par
\par
    'Try me.'\par
\par
    'Even then, lots of his dupes still had faith in him. Their god could do no \par
wrong, so he must have been framed.'\par
\par
    'Framed?'\par
\par
    'Sorry - convicted by faked evidence - sometimes used by the police to catch \par
criminals, when all else fails.'\par
\par
    'Hmm. Well, your swami was perfectly typical: I'm rather disappointed. But \par
he does help to prove my case -that most of humanity has always been insane, at \par
least some of the time.'\par
\par
    'Rather an unrepresentative sample - one small Flagstaff suburb.'\par
\par
    'True, but I could multiply it by thousands - not only in your century, but \par
all down the ages. There's never been anything, however absurd, that countless \par
people weren't prepared to believe, often so passionately that they'd fight to \par
the death rather than abandon their illusions. To me, that's a good operational \par
definition of insanity.'\par
\par
    'Would you argue that anyone with strong religious beliefs was insane?'\par
\par
    'In a strictly technical sense, yes - if they really were sincere, and not \par
hypocrites. As I suspect ninety per cent were.'\par
\par
    'I'm certain that Rabbi Berenstein was sincere - and he was one of the \par
sanest men I ever knew, as well as one of the finest. And how do you account for \par
this? The only real genius I ever met was Dr Chandra, who led the HAL project. I \par
once had to go into his office - there was no reply when I knocked, and I \par
thought it was unoccupied.'\par
\par
    'He was praying to a group of fantastic little bronze statues, draped with \par
flowers. One of them looked like an elephant... another had more than the \par
regular number of arms... I was quite embarrassed, but luckily he didn't hear me \par
and I tiptoed out. Would you say he was insane?'\par
\par
    'You've chosen a bad example: genius often is! So let's say: not insane, but \par
mentally impaired, owing to childhood conditioning. The Jesuits claimed: "Give \par
me a boy for six years, and he is mine for life." If they'd got hold of little \par
Chandra in time, he'd have been a devout Catholic - not a Hindu.'\par
\par
    'Possibly. But I'm puzzled - why were you so anxious to meet me? I'm afraid \par
I've never been a devout anything. What have I got to do with all this?'\par
\par
    Slowly, and with the obvious enjoyment of a man unburdening himself of a \par
heavy, long-hoarded secret, Dr Khan told him.\par

    Hello, Frank... So you've finally met Ted. Yes, you could call him a crank - \par
if you define that as an enthusiast with no sense of humour. But cranks often \par
get that way because they know a Big Truth - can, you hear my capitals?\par
\par
    - and no one will listen... I'm glad you did - and I suggest you take him \par
quite seriously.\par
\par
    You said you were surprised to see a Pope's portrait prominently displayed \par
in Ted's apartment. That would have been his hero, Pius XX - I'm sure I \par
mentioned him to you. Look him up - he's usually called the Impius! It's a \par
fascinating story, and exactly parallels something that happened just before you \par
were born. You must know how Mikhail Gorbachev, the President of the Soviet \par
Empire, brought about its dissolution at the end of the twentieth century, by \par
exposing its crimes and excesses.\par
\par
    He didn't intend to go that far - he'd hoped to reform it, but that was no \par
longer possible. We'll never know if Pius XX had the same idea, because he was \par
assassinated by a demented cardinal soon after he'd horrified the world by \par
releasing the secret files of the Inquisition...\par
\par
    The religious were still shaken by the discovery of TMA ZERO only a few \par
decades earlier - that had a great impact on Pius XX, and certainly influenced \par
his actions...\par
\par
    But you still haven't told me how Ted, that old cryptoDeist, thinks you can \par
help him in his search for God. I believe he's still mad at him for hiding so \par
successfully. Better not say I told you that.\par
\par
    On second thoughts, why not?\par

\par
    Hello - Indra - I've had another session with Dr Ted, though I've still not \par
told him just why you think he's angry with God!\par
\par
    But I've had some very interesting arguments - no, dialogues - with him, \par
though he does most of the talking. Never thought I'd get into philosophy again \par
after all these years of engineering. Perhaps I had to go through them first, to \par
appreciate it. Wonder how he'd grade me as a student?\par
\par
    Yesterday I tried this line of approach, to see his reaction. Perhaps it's \par
original, though I doubt it. Thought you'd like to hear it - will be interested \par
in your comments. Here's our discussion -MISS PRINGLE COPY AUDIO 94.\par
\par
    'Surely, Ted, you can't deny that most of the greatest works of human art \par
have been inspired by religious devotion. Doesn't that prove something?'\par
\par
    'Yes - but not in a way that will give much comfort to any believers! From \par
time to time, people amuse themselves making lists of the Biggests and Greatests \par
and Bests - I'm sure that was a popular entertainment in your day.'\par
\par
    'It certainly was.'\par
\par
    'Well, there have been some famous attempts to do this with the arts. Of \par
course such lists can't establish absolute - eternal - values, but they're \par
interesting and show how tastes change from age to age.'\par
\par
    'The last list I saw - it was on the Earth Artnet only a few years ago - was \par
divided into Architecture, Music, Visual Arts... I remember a few of the \par
examples... the Parthenon, the Taj Mahal... Bach's Toccata and Fugue was first \par
in music, followed by Verdi's Requiem Mass. In art - the Mona Lisa, of course. \par
Then - not sure of the order - a group of Buddha statues somewhere in Ceylon, \par
and the golden death-mask of young King Tut.\par
\par
    'Even if I could remember all the others - which of course I can't - it \par
doesn't matter: the important thing is their cultural and religious backgrounds. \par
Overall, no single religion dominated - except in music. And that could be due \par
to a purely technological accident: the organ and the other pre-electronic \par
musical instruments were perfected in the Christianized West. It could have \par
worked out quite differently... if, for example, the Greeks or the Chinese had \par
regarded machines as something more than toys.\par
\par
    'But what really settles the argument, as far as I'm concerned, is the \par
general consensus about the single greatest work of human art. Over and over \par
again, in almost every listing - it's Angkor Wat. Yet the religion that inspired \par
that has been extinct for centuries - no one even knows precisely what it was, \par
except that it involved hundreds of gods, not merely one!'\par
\par
    'Wish I could have thrown that at dear old Rabbi Berenstein - I'm sure he'd \par
have had a good answer.'\par
\par
    'I don't doubt it. I wish I could have met him myself. And I'm glad he never \par
lived to see what happened to Israel.'\par
\par
    END AUDIO.\par
\par
    There you have it, Indra. Wish the Grannymede had Angkor Wat on its menu - \par
I've never seen it - but you can't have everything...\par
\par
    Now, the question you really wanted answered... why is Dr Ted so delighted \par
that I'm here?\par
\par
    As you know, he's convinced that the key to many mysteries lies on Europa - \par
where no one has been allowed to land for a thousand years.\par
\par
    He thinks I may be an exception. He believes I have a friend there. Yes - \par
Dave Bowman, or whatever he's now become...\par
\par
    We know that he survived being drawn into the Big Brother Monolith - and \par
somehow revisited Earth afterwards. But there's more, that I didn't know. Very \par
few people do, because the Medes are embarrassed to talk about it...\par
\par
    Ted Khan has spent years collecting the evidence, and is now quite certain \par
of the facts - even though he can't explain them. On at least six occasions, \par
about a century apart, reliable observers here in Anubis have reported seeing an \par
- apparition - just like the one that Heywood Floyd met aboard Discovery. Though \par
not one of them knew about that incident, they were all able to identify Dave \par
when they were shown his hologram. And there was another sighting aboard a \par
survey ship that made a close approach to Europa, six hundred years ago...\par
\par
    Individually, no one would take these cases seriously - but altogether they \par
make a pattern. Ted's quite sure that Dave Bowman survives in some form, \par
presumably associated with the Monolith we call the Great Wall. And he still has \par
some interest in our affairs.\par
\par
    Though he's made no attempt at communication, Ted hopes we can make contact. \par
He believes that I'm the only human who can do it...\par
\par
    I'm still trying to make up my mind. Tomorrow, I'll talk it over with \par
Captain Chandler. Will let you know what we decide. Love, Frank.\par

    'Do you believe in ghosts, Dim?'\par
\par
    'Certainly not: but like every sensible man, I'm afraid of them. Why do you \par
ask?'\par
\par
    'If it wasn't a ghost, it was the most vivid dream I've ever had. Last night \par
I had a conversation with Dave Bowman.'\par
\par
    Poole knew that Captain Chandler would take him seriously, when the occasion \par
required; nor was he disappointed.\par
\par
    'Interesting - but there's an obvious explanation. You've been living here \par
in the Bowman Suite, for Deus's sake! You told me yourself it feels haunted.'\par
\par
    'I'm sure - well, ninety-nine per cent sure - that you're right, and the \par
whole thing was prompted by the discussions I've been having with Prof. Ted. \par
Have you heard the reports that Dave Bowman occasionally appears in Anubis? \par
About once every hundred years? Just as he did to Dr Floyd aboard Discovery, \par
after she'd been reactivated.'\par
\par
    'What happened there? I've heard vague stories, but never taken them \par
seriously.'\par
\par
    'Dr Khan does - and so do I - I've seen the original recordings. Floyd's \par
sitting in my old chair when a kind of dust-cloud forms behind him, and shapes \par
itself into Dave - though only the head has detail. Then it gives that famous \par
message, warning him to leave.'\par
\par
    'Who wouldn't have? But that was a thousand years ago. Plenty of time to \par
fake it.'\par
\par
    'What would be the point? Khan and I were looking at it yesterday. I'd bet \par
my life it's authentic.'\par
\par
    'As a matter of fact, I agree with you. And I have heard those reports...'\par
\par
    Chandler's voice trailed away, and he looked slightly embarrassed.\par
\par
    'Long time ago, I had a girl-friend here in Anubis. She told me that her \par
grandfather had seen Bowman. I laughed.'\par
\par
    'I wonder if Ted has that sighting on his list. Could you put him in touch \par
with your friend?'\par
\par
    'Er - rather not. We haven't spoken for years. For all I know, she may be on \par
the Moon, or Mars... Anyway, why is Professor Ted interested?'\par
\par
    'That's what I really wanted to discuss with you.'\par
\par
    'Sounds ominous. Go ahead,'\par
\par
    'Ted thinks that Dave Bowman - or whatever he's become - may still exist - \par
up there on Europa.'\par
\par
    'After a thousand years?'\par
\par
    'Well - look at me.'\par
\par
    'One sample is poor statistics, my maths prof. used to say. But go on.'\par
\par
    'It's a complicated story - or maybe a jigsaw, with most of the pieces \par
missing. But it's generally agreed that something crucial happened to our \par
ancestors when that Monolith appeared in Africa, four million years ago. It \par
marks a turning point in prehistory - the first appearance of tools - and \par
weapons - and religion... That can't be pure coincidence. The Monolith must have \par
done something to us - surely it couldn't have just stood there, passively \par
accepting worship...'\par
\par
    'Ted's fond of quoting a famous palaeontologist who said "TMA ZERO gave us \par
an evolutionary kick in the pants". He argues that the kick wasn't in a wholly \par
desirable direction. Did we have to become so mean and nasty to survive? Maybe \par
we did... As I understand him, Ted believes that there's something fundamentally \par
wrong with the wiring of our brains, which makes us incapable of consistent \par
logical thinking. To make matters worse, though all creatures need a certain \par
amount of aggressiveness to survive, we seem to have far more than is absolutely \par
necessary. And no other animal tortures its fellows as we do. Is this an \par
evolutionary accident - a piece of genetic bad luck?\par
\par
    'It's also widely agreed that TMA ONE was planted on the Moon to keep track \par
of the project - experiment - whatever it was - and to report to Jupiter - the \par
obvious place for Solar System Mission Control. That's why another Monolith - \par
Big Brother - was waiting there. Had been waiting four million years, when \par
Discovery arrived. Agreed so far?'\par
\par
    'Yes; I've always thought that was the most plausible theory.'\par
\par
    'Now for the more speculative stuff. Bowman was apparently swallowed up by \par
Big Brother, yet something of his personality seems to have survived. Twenty \par
years after that encounter with Heywood Floyd in the second Jupiter expedition, \par
they had another contact aboard Universe, when Floyd joined it for the 2061 \par
rendezvous with Halley's Comet. At least, so he tells us in his memoirs - though \par
he was well over a hundred when he dictated them.'\par
\par
    'Could have been senile.'\par
\par
    'Not according to all the contemporary accounts! Also - perhaps even more \par
significant - his grandson Chris had some equally weird experiences when Galaxy \par
made its forced landing on Europa. And, of course, that's where the Monolith - \par
or a Monolith - is, right now! Surrounded by Europans...'\par
\par
    'I'm beginning to see what Dr Ted's driving at. This is where we came in - \par
the whole cycle's starting over again. The Europs are being groomed for \par
stardom.'\par
\par
    'Exactly - everything fits. Jupiter ignited to give them a sun, to thaw out \par
their frozen world. The warning to us to keep our distance - presumably so that \par
we wouldn't interfere with their development...'\par
\par
    'Where have I heard that idea before? Of course, Frank - it goes back a \par
thousand years - to your own time! "The Prime Directive"! We still get lots of \par
laughs from those old Star Trek programmes.'\par
\par
    'Did I ever tell you I once met some of the actors? They would have been \par
surprised to see me now... And I've always had two thoughts about that non-\par
interference policy. The Monolith certainly violated it with us, back there in \par
Africa. One might argue that did have disastrous results...'\par
\par
    'So better luck next time - on Europa!' Poole laughed, without much humour. \par
'Khan used those exact words.'\par
\par
    'And what does he think we should do about it? Above all - where do you come \par
into the picture?'\par
\par
    'First of all, we must find what's really happening on Europa - and why. \par
Merely observing it from space is not enough.'\par
\par
    'What else can we do? All the probes the Medes have sent there were blown \par
up, just before landing.'\par
\par
    'And ever since the mission to rescue Galaxy, crew-carrying ships have been \par
diverted by some field of force, which no one can figure out. Very interesting: \par
it proves that whatever is down there is protective, but not malevolent. And - \par
this is the important point - it must have some way of scanning what's on the \par
way. It can distinguish between robots and humans.'\par
\par
    'More than I can do, sometimes. Go on.'\par
\par
    'Well, Ted thinks there's one human being who might make it down to the \par
surface of Europa - because his old friend is there, and may have some influence \par
with the 'powers-that-be.'\par
\par
    Captain Dimitri Chandler gave a long, low whistle.\par
\par
    'And you're willing to risk it?'\par
\par
    'Yes: what have I got to lose?'\par
\par
    'One valuable shuttle craft, if I know what you have in mind. Is that why \par
you've been learning to fly Falcon?'\par
\par
    'Well, now that you mention it... the idea had occurred to me.'\par
\par
    'I'll have to think it over - I'll admit I'm intrigued, but there are lots \par
of problems.'\par
\par
    'Knowing you, I'm sure they won't stand in the way - once you've decided to \par

    Dear Indra - I'm not trying to be dramatic, but this may be my last message \par
from Ganymede. By the time you receive it, I will be on my way to Europa.\par
\par
    Though it's a sudden decision - and no one is more surprised than I am - \par
I've thought it over very carefully. As you'll have guessed, Ted Khan is largely \par
responsible... let him do the explaining, if I don't come back. Please don't \par
misunderstand me - in no way do I regard this as a suicide mission! But I'm \par
ninety per cent convinced by Ted's arguments, and he's aroused my curiosity so \par
much that I'd never forgive myself if I turned down this once-in-a-lifetime \par
opportunity. Maybe I should say once in two lifetimes...\par
\par
    I'm flying Goliath's little one-person shuttle Falcon - how I'd have loved \par
to demonstrate her to my old colleagues back at the Space Administration! \par
Judging by past records, the most likely outcome is that I'll be diverted away \par
from Europa before I can land. Even this will teach me something...\par
\par
    And if it - presumably the local Monolith, the Great Wall - decides to treat \par
me like the robot probes it's zapped in the past, I'll never know. That's a risk \par
I'm prepared to take.\par

    'Hoping what?'\par
\par
    'That I can make some sort of contact with Dave, or whatever it is, before I \par
attempt to land.'\par
\par
    'Yes, it's always rude to drop in uninvited - even with people you know, let \par
alone perfect strangers like the Europs. Perhaps you should take some gifts - \par
what did the old-time explorers use? I believe mirrors and beads were once \par
popular.'\par
\par
    Chandler's facetious tone did not disguise his real concern, both for Poole \par
and for the valuable piece of equipment he proposed to borrow - and for which \par
the skipper of Goliath was ultimately responsible.\par
\par
    'I'm still trying to decide how we work this. If you come back a hero, I \par
want to bask in your reflected glory. But if you lose Falcon as well as \par
yourself, what shall I say? That you stole the shuttle while we weren't looking? \par
I'm afraid no one would buy that story. Ganymede Traffic Control's very \par
efficient - has to be! If you left without advance notice, they'd be on to you \par
in a microsec - well, a millisecond. No way you could leave unless I file your \par
flight-plan ahead of time.'\par
\par
    'So this is what I propose to do, unless I think of something better.'\par
\par
    'You're taking Falcon out for a final qualification test - everyone knows \par
you've already soloed. You'll go into a two-thousand-kilometre-high orbit above \par
Europa - nothing unusual about that - people do it all the time, and the local \par
authorities don't seem to object.'\par
\par
    'Estimated total flight time five hours plus or minus ten minutes. If you \par
suddenly change your mind about coming home, no one can do anything about it - \par
at least, no one on Ganymede. Of course, I'll make some indignant noises, and \par
say how astonished I am by such gross navigational errors, etc., etc. Whatever \par
will look best in the subsequent Court of Enquiry.'\par
\par
    'Would it come to that? I don't want to do anything that will get you into \par
trouble.'\par
\par
    'Don't worry - it's time there was a little excitement round here. But only \par
you and I know about this plot; try not to mention it to the crew - I want them \par
to have - what was that other useful expression you taught me? - "plausible \par
deniability".'\par
\par
    'Thanks, Dim - I really appreciate what you're doing. And I hope you'll \par
never have to regret hauling me aboard Goliath, out round Neptune.'\par
\par
    \par
\par
    Poole found it hard to avoid arousing suspicion, by the way he behaved \par
towards his new crewmates as they prepared Falcon for what was supposed to be a \par
short, routine flight. Only he and Chandler knew that it might be nothing of the \par
kind.\par
\par
    Yet he was not heading into the totally unknown, as he and Dave Bowman had \par
done a thousand years ago. Stored in the shuttle's memory were high-resolution \par
maps of Europa showing details down to a few metres across. He knew exactly \par
where he wished to go; it only remained to see if he would be allowed to break \par
the centuries-long quarantine.\par
\par
    \par
\par
24\par
Escape\par
\par
    \par
\par
    'Manual control, please.'\par
\par
    'Are you sure, Frank?'\par
\par
    'Quite sure, Falcon... Thank you.'\par
\par
    Illogical though it seemed, most of the human race had found it impossible \par
not to be polite to its artificial children, however simple-minded they might \par
be. Whole volumes of psychology, as well as popular guides (How Not to Hurt Your \par
Computer's Feelings; Artificial Intelligence - Real irritation were two of the \par
best-known titles) had been written on the subject of Man-Machine etiquette. \par
Long ago it had been decided that, however inconsequential rudeness to robots \par
might appear to be, it should be discouraged. All too easily, it could spread to \par
human relationships as well.\par
\par
    Falcon was now in orbit, just as her flight-plan had promised, at a safe two \par
thousand kilometres above Europa. The giant moon's crescent dominated the sky \par
ahead, and even the area not illuminated by Lucifer was so brilliantly lit by \par
the much more distant Sun that every detail was clearly visible. Poole needed no \par
optical aid to see his planned destination, on the still-icy shore of the Sea of \par
Galilee, not far from the skeleton of the first spacecraft to land on this \par
world. Though the Europans had long ago removed all its metal components, the \par
ill-fated Chinese ship still served as a memorial to its crew; and it was \par
appropriate that the only 'town' - even if an alien one - on this whole world \par
should have been named 'Tsienville'.\par
\par
    Poole had decided to come down over the Sea, and then fly very slowly \par
towards Tsienville - hoping that this approach would appear friendly, or at \par
least non-aggressive. Though he admitted to himself that this was very na\'efve, he \par
could think of no better alternative.\par
\par
    Then, suddenly, just as he was dropping below the thousand-kilometre level, \par
there was an interruption - not of the kind he had hoped for, but one which he \par
had been expecting.\par
\par
    'This is Ganymede Control calling Falcon. You have departed from your \par
flight-plan. Please advise immediately what is happening.'\par
\par
    It was hard to ignore such an urgent request, but in the circumstances it \par
seemed the best thing to do.\par
\par
    Exactly thirty seconds later, and a hundred kilometres closer to Europa, \par
Ganymede repeated its message. Once again Poole ignored it - but Falcon did not.\par
\par
    'Are you quite sure you want to do this, Frank?' asked the shuttle. Though \par
Poole knew perfectly well that he was imagining it, he would have sworn there \par
was a note of anxiety in its voice.\par
\par
    'Quite sure, Falcon. I know exactly what I'm doing.'\par
\par
    That was certainly untrue, and any moment now further lying might be \par
necessary, to a more sophisticated audience.\par
\par
    Seldom-activated indicator lights started to flash near the edge of the \par
control board. Poole smiled with satisfaction: everything was going according to \par
plan.\par
\par
    'This is Ganymede Control! Do you receive me, Falcon? You are operating on \par
manual override, so I am unable to assist you. What is happening? You are still \par
descending towards Europa. Please acknowledge immediately.'\par
\par
    Poole began to experience mild twinges of conscience. He thought he \par
recognized the Controller's voice, and was almost certain that it was a charming \par
lady he had met at a reception given by the Mayor, soon after his arrival at \par
Anubis. She sounded genuinely alarmed.\par
\par
    Suddenly, he knew how to relieve her anxiety - as well as to attempt \par
something which he had previously dismissed as altogether too absurd. Perhaps, \par
after all, it was worth a try: it certainly wouldn't do any harm - and it might \par
even work.\par
\par
    'This is Frank Poole, calling from Falcon. I am perfectly OK - but something \par
seems to have taken over the controls, and is bringing the shuttle down towards \par
Europa. I hope you are receiving this - I will continue to report as long as \par
possible.'\par
\par
    Well, he hadn't actually lied to the worried Controller, and one day he \par
hoped he would be able to face her with a clear conscience.\par
\par
    He continued to talk, trying to sound as if he was completely sincere, \par
instead of skirting the edge of truth.\par
\par
    'This is Frank Poole aboard the shuttle Falcon, descending towards Europa. I \par
assume that some outside force has taken charge of my spacecraft, and will be \par
landing it safely.'\par
\par
    'Dave - this is your old shipmate Frank. Are you the entity that is \par
controlling me? I have reason to think that you are on Europa.\par
\par
    'If so - I look forward to meeting you - wherever or whatever you are.'\par
\par
    Not for a moment did he imagine there would be any reply: even Ganymede \par
Control appeared to be shocked into silence.\par
\par
    And yet, in a way, he had an answer. Falcon was still being permitted to \par
descend towards the Sea of Galilee.\par
\par
    Europa was only fifty kilometres below; with his naked eyes Poole could now \par
see the narrow black bar where the greatest of the Monoliths stood guard - if \par
indeed it was doing that - on the outskirts of Tsienville.\par
\par
    No human being had been allowed to come so close for a thousand years.\par
\par
    \par
\par

Fire in the Deep\par
\par
    \par
\par
    For millions of years it had been an ocean world, its hidden waters \par
protected from the vacuum of space by a crust of ice. In most places the ice was \par
kilometres thick, but there were lines of weakness where it had cracked open and \par
torn apart. Then there had been a brief battle between two implacably hostile \par
elements that came into direct contact on no other world in the Solar System, \par
The war between Sea and Space always ended in the same stalemate; the exposed \par
water simultaneously boiled and froze, repairing the armour of ice.\par
\par
    The seas of Europa would have frozen completely solid long ago without the \par
influence of nearby Jupiter. Its gravity continually kneaded the core of the \par
little world; the forces that convulsed Io were also working there, though with \par
much less ferocity. Everywhere in the deep was evidence of that tug-of-war \par
between planet and satellite, in the continual roar and thunder of submarine \par
earthquakes, the shriek of gases escaping from the interior, the infrasonic \par
pressure waves of avalanches sweeping over the abyssal plains. By comparison \par
with the tumultuous ocean that covered Europa, even the noisy seas of Earth were \par
muted.\par
\par
    Here and there, scattered over the deserts of the deep, were oases that \par
would have amazed and delighted any terrestrial biologist. They extended for \par
several kilometres around tangled masses of pipes and chimneys deposited by \par
mineral brines gushing from the interior. Often they created natural parodies of \par
Gothic castles, from which black, scalding liquids pulsed in a slow rhythm, as \par
if driven by the beating of some mighty heart. And like blood, they were the \par
authentic sign of life itself.\par
\par
    The boiling fluids drove back the deadly cold leaking down from above, and \par
formed islands of warmth on the sea-bed. Equally important, they brought from \par
Europa's interior all the chemicals of life. Such fertile oases, offering food \par
and energy in abundance, had been discovered by the twentieth-century explorers \par
of Earth's oceans. Here they were present on an immensely larger scale, and in \par
far greater variety.\par
\par
    Delicate, spidery structures that seemed to be the analogue of plants \par
flourished in the 'tropical' zones closest to the sources of heat. Crawling \par
among these were bizarre slugs and worms, some feeding on the plants, others \par
obtaining their food directly from the mineral-laden waters around them. At \par
greater distances from the submarine fires around which all these creatures \par
warmed themselves lived sturdier, more robust organisms, not unlike crabs or \par
spiders.\par
\par
    Armies of biologists could have spent lifetimes studying one small oasis. \par
Unlike the Palaeozoic terrestrial seas, the Europan abyss was not a stable \par
environment, so evolution had progressed with astonishing speed, producing \par
multitudes of fantastic forms. And all were under the same indefinite stay of \par
execution; sooner or later, each fountain of life would weaken and die, as the \par
forces that powered it moved their focus elsewhere. All across the Europan sea-\par
bed was evidence of such tragedies; countless circular areas were littered with \par
the skeletons and mineral-encrusted remains of dead creatures, where entire \par
chapters of evolution had been deleted from the book of life. Some had left as \par
their only memorial huge, empty shells like convoluted trumpets, larger than a \par
man. And there were clams of many shapes - bivalves, and even trivalves, as well \par
as spiral stone patterns, many metres across - exactly like the beautiful \par
ammonites that disappeared so mysteriously from Earth's oceans at the end of the \par
Cretaceous Period.\par
\par
    Among the greatest wonders of the Europan abyss were rivers of incandescent \par
lava, pouring from the calderas of submarine volcanoes. The pressure at these \par
depths was so great that the water in contact with the red-hot magma could not \par
flash into steam, so the two liquids co-existed in an uneasy truce.\par
\par
    There, on another world and with alien actors, something like the story of \par
Egypt had been played out long before the coming of Man. As the Nile had brought \par
life to a narrow ribbon of desert, so this river of warmth had vivified the \par
Europan deep. Along its banks, in a band never more than a few kilometres wide, \par
species after species had evolved and flourished and passed away. And some had \par
left permanent monuments.\par
\par
    Often, they were not easy to distinguish from the natural formations around \par
the thermal vents, and even when they were clearly not due to pure chemistry, \par
one would be hard put to decide whether they were the product of instinct or \par
intelligence. On Earth, the termites reared condominiums almost as impressive as \par
any found in the single vast ocean that enveloped this frozen world.\par
\par
    Along the narrow band of fertility in the deserts of the deep, whole \par
cultures and even civilizations might have risen and fallen, armies might have \par
marched - or swum - under the command of Europan Tamberlanes or Napoleons. And \par
the rest of their world would never have known, for all their oases were as \par
isolated from one another as the planets themselves, The creatures who basked in \par
the glow of the lava rivers, and fed around the hot vents, could not cross the \par
hostile wilderness between their lonely islands. If they had ever produced \par
historians and philosophers, each culture would have been convinced that it was \par
alone in the Universe.\par
\par
    Yet even the space between the oases was not altogether empty of life; there \par
were hardier creatures who had dared its rigours. Some were the Europan \par
analogues of fish - streamlined torpedoes, propelled by vertical tails, steered \par
by fins along their bodies. The resemblance to the most successful dwellers in \par
Earth's oceans was inevitable; given the same engineering problems, evolution \par
must produce very similar answers. Witness the dolphin and the shark - \par
superficially almost identical, yet from far distant branches of the tree of \par
life.\par
\par
    There was, however, one very obvious difference between the fish of the \par
Europan seas and those in terrestrial oceans; they had no gills, for there was \par
hardly a trace of oxygen to be extracted from the waters in which they swam. \par
Like the creatures around Earth's own geothermal vents, their metabolism was \par
based on sulphur compounds, present in abundance in this volcanic environment.\par
\par
    And very few had eyes. Apart from the flickering glow of lava outpourings, \par
and occasional bursts of bioluminescence from creatures seeking mates, or \par
hunters questing prey, it was a lightless world.\par
\par
    It was also a doomed one. Not only were its energy sources sporadic and \par
constantly shifting, but the tidal forces that drove them were steadily \par
weakening. Even if they developed true intelligence, the Europans were trapped \par
between fire and ice.\par
\par
    Barring a miracle, they would perish with the final freezing of their little \par
world.\par
\par
    Lucifer had wrought that miracle.\par
\par
    \par
\par
26\par
Tsienville\par
\par
    \par
\par
    In the final moments, as he came in over the coast at a sedate hundred \par
kilometres an hour, Poole wondered if there might be some last-minute \par
intervention. But nothing untoward happened, even when he moved slowly along the \par
black, forbidding face of the Great Wall.\par
\par
    It was the inevitable name for the Europa Monolith as, unlike its little \par
brothers on Earth and Moon, it was lying horizontally, and was more than twenty \par
kilometres long. Although it was literally billions of times greater in volume \par
than TMA ZERO and TMA ONE, its proportions were exactly the same - that \par
intriguing ratio 1:4:9, inspirer of so much numerological nonsense over the \par
centuries.\par
\par
    As the vertical face was almost ten kilometres high, one plausible theory \par
maintained that among its other functions the Great Wall served as a wind-break, \par
protecting Tsienville from the ferocious gales that occasionally roared in from \par
the Sea of Galilee. They were much less frequent now that the climate had \par
stabilized, but a thousand years earlier they would have been a severe \par
discouragement to any life-forms emerging from the ocean.\par
\par
    Though he had fully intended to do so, Poole had never found time to visit \par
the Tycho Monolith - still Top Secret when he had left for Jupiter - and Earth's \par
gravity made its twin at Olduvai inaccessible to him. But he had seen their \par
images so often that they were much more familiar than the proverbial back of \par
the hand (and how many people, he had often wondered, would recognize the backs \par
of their hands?). Apart from the enormous difference in scale, there was \par
absolutely no way of distinguishing the Great Wall from TMA ONE and TMA ZERO - \par
or, for that matter, the 'Big Brother' Monolith that Discovery and the Leonov \par
had encountered orbiting Jupiter.\par
\par
    According to some theories, perhaps crazy enough to be true, there was only \par
one archetypal Monolith, and all the others - whatever their size - were merely \par
projections or images of it. Poole recalled these ideas when he noticed the \par
spotless, unsullied smoothness of the Great Wall's towering ebon face. Surely, \par
after so many centuries in such a hostile environment, it should have collected \par
a few patches of grime! Yet it looked as immaculate as if an army of window-\par
cleaners had just polished every square centimetre.\par
\par
    Then he recalled that although everyone who had ever come to view TMA ONE \par
and TMA ZERO felt an irresistible urge to touch their apparently pristine \par
surfaces, no one had ever succeeded. Fingers - diamond drills - laser knives - \par
all skittered across the Monoliths as if they were coated by an impenetrable \par
film. Or as if - and this was another popular theory - they were not quite in \par
this universe, but somehow separated from it by an utterly impassable fraction \par
of a millimetre.\par
\par
    He made one complete, leisurely circuit of the Great Wall, which remained \par
totally indifferent to his progress. Then he brought the shuttle - still on \par
manual, in case Ganymede Control made any further attempts to 'rescue' him - to \par
the outer limits of Tsienville, and hovered there looking for the best place to \par
land.\par
\par
    The scene through Falcon's small panoramic window was wholly familiar to \par
him; he had examined it so often in Ganymede recordings, never imagining that \par
one day he would be observing it in reality. The Europs, it seemed, had no idea \par
of town planning; hundreds of hemispherical structures were scattered apparently \par
at random over an area about a kilometre across. Some were so small that even \par
human children would feel cramped in them; though others were big enough to hold \par
a large family, none was more than five metres high.\par
\par
    And they were all made from the same material, which gleamed a ghostly white \par
in the double daylight. On Earth, the Esquimaux had found the identical answer \par
to the challenge of their own frigid, materials-poor environment; Tsienville's \par
igloos were also made of ice.\par
\par
    In lieu of streets, there were canals - as best suited creatures who were \par
still amphibious, and apparently returned to the water to sleep. Also, it was \par
believed, to feed and to mate, though neither hypothesis had been proved.\par
\par
    Tsienville had been called 'Venice, made of ice', and Poole had to agree \par
that it was an apt description. However, there were no Venetians in sight; the \par
place looked as if it had been deserted for years.\par
\par
    And here was another mystery; despite the fact that Lucifer was fifty times \par
brighter than the distant Sun, and was a permanent fixture in the sky, the \par
Europs still seemed locked to an ancient rhythm of night and day. They returned \par
to the ocean at sunset, and emerged with the rising of the Sun - despite the \par
fact that the level of illumination had changed by only a few per cent. Perhaps \par
there was a parallel on Earth, where the life cycles of many creatures were \par
controlled as much by the feeble Moon as the far more brilliant Sun.\par
\par
    It would be sunrise in another hour, and then the inhabitants of Tsienville \par
would return to land and go about their leisurely affairs - as by human \par
standards, they certainly were. The sulphur-based biochemistry that powered the \par
Europs was not as efficient as the oxygen-driven one that energized the vast \par
majority of terrestrial animals. Even a sloth could outrun a Europ, so it was \par
difficult to regard them as potentially dangerous. That was the Good News; the \par
Bad News was that even with the best intentions on both sides, attempts at \par
communication would be extremely slow - perhaps intolerably tedious.\par
\par
    It was about time, Poole decided, that he reported back to Ganymede Control. \par
They must be getting very anxious, and he wondered how his co-conspirator, \par
Captain Chandler, was dealing with the situation.\par
\par
    'Falcon calling Ganymede. As you can doubtless see, I have - er - been \par
brought to rest just above Tsienville. There is no sign of hostility, and as \par
it's still solar night here all the Europs are underwater. Will call you again \par
as soon as I'm on the ground.'\par
\par
    Dim would have been proud of him, Poole thought, as he brought Falcon down \par
gently as a snowflake on a smooth patch of ice. He was taking no chances with \par
its stability, and set the inertial drive to cancel all but a fraction of the \par
shuttle's weight - just enough, he hoped, to prevent it being blown away by any \par
wind.\par
\par
    He was on Europa - the first human in a thousand years. Had Armstrong and \par
Aldrin felt this sense of elation, when Eagle touched down on the Moon? Probably \par
they were too busy checking their Lunar Module's primitive and totally \par
unintelligent systems. Falcon, of course, was doing all this automatically. The \par
little cabin was now very quiet, apart from the inevitable - and reassuring - \par
murmur of well-tempered electronics. It gave Poole a considerable shock when \par
Chandler's voice, obviously pre-recorded, interrupted his thoughts.\par
\par
    'So you made it! Congratulations! As you know, we're scheduled to return to \par
the Belt week after next, but that should give you plenty of time.'\par
\par
    'After five days, Falcon knows what to do. She'll find her way home, with or \par
without you. So good luck!'\par

\par
    Hello, Dim - thanks for that cheerful message! I feel rather silly using \par
this program - as if I'm a secret agent in one of the spy melodramas that used \par
to be so popular before I was born. Still, it will allow some privacy, which may \par
be useful. Hope Miss Pringle has downloaded it properly... of course, Miss P, \par
I'm only joking!\par
\par
    By the way, I'm getting a barrage of requests from all the news media in the \par
Solar System. Please try to hold them off - or divert them to Dr Ted. He'll \par
enjoy handling them...\par
\par
    Since Ganymede has me on camera all the time, I won't waste breath telling \par
you what I'm seeing. If all goes well, we should have some action in a few \par
minutes - and we'll know if it really was a good idea to let the Europs find me \par
already sitting here peacefully, waiting to greet them when they come to the \par
surface...\par
\par
    Whatever happens, it won't be as big a surprise to me as it was to Dr Chang \par
and his colleagues, when they landed here a thousand years ago! I played his \par
famous last message again, just before leaving Ganymede. I must confess it gave \par
me an eerie feeling - couldn't help wondering if something like that could \par
possibly happen again... wouldn't like to immortalize myself the way poor Chang \par
did...\par
\par
    Of course, I can always lift off if something starts going wrong... and \par
here's an interesting thought that's just occurred to me... I wonder if the \par
Europs have any history - any kind of records... any memory of what happened \par
just a few kilometres from here, a thousand years ago?\par
\par
    \par

Ice and Vacuum\par
\par
    \par
\par
    ...This is Dr Chang, calling from Europa. I hope you cart hear me, \par
especially Dr Floyd - I know you're aboard Leonov... I may not have much time... \par
aiming my suit antenna where I think you are... please relay this information to \par
Earth.\par
\par
    Tsien was destroyed three hours ago. I'm the only survivor. Using my suit \par
radio - no idea if it has enough range, but it's the only chance. Please listen \par
carefully...\par
\par
    THERE IS LIFE ON EUROPA. I repeat: THERE IS LIFE ON EUROPA...\par
\par
    We landed safely, checked all the systems, and ran out the hoses so we could \par
start pumping water into our propellant tanks immediately... just in case we had \par
to leave in a hurry.\par
\par
    Everything was going according to plan... it seemed almost too good to be \par
true. The tanks were half full when Dr Lee and I went out to check the pipe \par
insulation. Tsien stands - stood - about thirty metres from the edge of the \par
Grand Canal. Pipes went directly from it and down through the ice. Very thin - \par
not safe to walk on.\par
\par
    Jupiter was quarter full, and we had five kilowatts of lighting strung up on \par
the ship. She looked like a Christmas tree - beautiful, reflected on the ice...\par
\par
    Lee saw it first - a huge dark mass rising up from the depths. At first we \par
thought it was a school of fish - too large for a single organism - then it \par
started to break through the ice, and began moving towards us.\par
\par
    It looked rather like huge strands of wet seaweed, crawling along the \par
ground. Lee ran back to the ship to get a camera - I stayed to watch, reporting \par
over the radio. The thing moved so slowly I could easily outrun it. I was much \par
more excited than alarmed. Thought I knew what kind of creature it was - I've \par
seen pictures of the kelp forests off California - but I was quite wrong.\par
\par
    I could tell it was in trouble. It couldn't possibly survive at a \par
temperature a hundred and fifty below its normal environment. It was freezing \par
solid as it moved forward -bits were breaking off like glass - but it was still \par
advancing towards the ship, a black tidal wave, slowing down all the time.\par
\par
    I was still so surprised that I couldn't think straight and I couldn't \par
imagine what it was trying to do. Even though it was heading towards Tsien it \par
still seemed completely harmless, like - well, a small forest on the move. I \par
remember smiling - it reminded me of Macbeth's Birnam Wood...\par
\par
    Then I suddenly realized the danger. Even if it was completely inoffensive - \par
it was heavy - with all the ice it was carrying, it must have weighed several \par
tons, even in this low gravity.\par
\par
    And it was slowly, painfully climbing up our landing gear... the legs were \par
beginning to buckle, all in slow motion, like something in a dream - or a \par
nightmare...\par
\par
    Not until the ship started to topple did I realize what the thing was trying \par
to do - and then it was far too late. We could have saved ourselves - if we'd \par
only switched off our lights!\par
\par
    Perhaps it's a phototrope, its biological cycle triggered by the sunlight \par
that filters down through the ice. Or it could have been attracted like a moth \par
to a candle. Our floodlights must have been more brilliant than anything that \par
Europa has ever known, even the Sun itself...\par
\par
    Then the ship crashed. I saw the hull split, a cloud of snowflakes form as \par
moisture condensed. All the lights went out, except for one, swinging back and \par
forth on a cable a couple of metres above the ground.\par
\par
    I don't know what happened immediately after that. The next thing I \par
remember, I was standing under the light, beside the wreck of the ship, with a \par
fine powdering of fresh snow all around me. I could see my footsteps in it very \par
clearly. I must have run there; perhaps only a minute or two had elapsed...\par
\par
    The plant - I still thought of it as a plant - was motionless. I wondered if \par
it had been damaged by the impact; large sections - as thick as a man's arms - \par
had splintered off, like broken twigs.\par
\par
    Then the main trunk started to move again. It pulled away from the hull, and \par
began to crawl towards me. That was when I knew for certain that the thing was \par
light-sensitive: I was standing immediately under the thousand-watt lamp, which \par
had stopped swinging now.\par
\par
    Imagine an oak tree - better still, a banyan with its multiple trunks and \par
roots - flattened out by gravity and trying to creep along the ground. It got to \par
within five metres of the light, then started to spread out until it had made a \par
perfect circle around me. Presumably that was the limit of its tolerance - the \par
point at which photo-attraction turned to repulsion.\par
\par
    After that, nothing happened for several minutes, I wondered if it was dead \par
- frozen solid at last.\par
\par
    Then I saw that large buds were forming on many of the branches. It was like \par
watching a time-lapse film of flowers opening. In fact I thought they were \par
flowers - each about as big as a man's head.\par
\par
    Delicate, beautifully coloured membranes started to unfold. Even then, it \par
occurred to me that no one - no thing - could ever have seen these colours \par
properly, until we brought our lights - our fatal lights - to this world.\par
\par
    Tendrils, stamens, waving feebly... I walked over to the living wall that \par
surrounded me, so that I could see exactly what was happening. Neither then, or \par
at any other time, had I felt the slightest fear of the creature. I was certain \par
that it was not malevolent - if indeed it was conscious at all.\par
\par
    There were scores of the big flowers, in various stages of unfolding. Now \par
they reminded me of butterflies, just emerging from the chrysalis - wings \par
crumpled, still feeble - I was getting closer and closer to the truth.\par
\par
    But they were freezing - dying as quickly as they formed. Then, one after \par
another, they dropped off from the parent buds. For a few moments they flopped \par
around like fish stranded on dry land - and at last I realized exactly what they \par
were. Those membranes weren't petals - they were fins, or their equivalent. This \par
was the free-swimming larval stage of the creature. Probably it spends much of \par
its life rooted on the sea-bed, then sends these mobile offspring in search of \par
new territory. Just like the corals of Earth's oceans.\par
\par
    I knelt down to get a closer look at one of the little creatures. The \par
beautiful colours were fading now, to a drab brown. Some of the petal-fins had \par
snapped off, becoming brittle shards as they froze. But it was still moving \par
feebly, and as I approached it tried to avoid me. I wondered how it sensed my \par
presence.\par
\par
    Then I noticed that the stamens - as I'd called them -all carried bright \par
blue dots at their tips. They looked like tiny star sapphires - or the blue eyes \par
along the mantle of a scallop - aware of light, but unable to form true images. \par
As I watched, the vivid blue faded, the gems became dull, ordinary stones...\par
\par
    Dr Floyd - or anyone else who is listening - I haven't much more time; my \par
life-support system alarm has just sounded. But I've almost finished.\par
\par
    I knew then what I had to do. The cable to that thousand-watt lamp was \par
hanging almost to the ground. I gave it a few tugs, and the light went out in a \par
shower of sparks.\par
\par
    I wondered whether it was too late. For a few minutes nothing happened. So I \par
walked over to the wall of tangled branches around me - and kicked it.\par
\par
    Slowly, the creature started to unweave itself, and to retreat back to the \par
Canal. I followed it all the way back to the water, encouraging it with more \par
kicks when it slowed down, feeling the fragments of ice crunching all the time \par
beneath my boots... As it neared the Canal, it seemed to gain strength and \par
energy, as if it knew it was approaching its natural home. I wondered if it \par
would survive, to bud again.\par
\par
    It disappeared through the surface, leaving a few last dead larvae on the \par
alien land. The exposed free water bubbled for a few minutes until a scab of \par
protective ice sealed it from the vacuum above. Then I walked back to the ship \par
to see if there was anything to salvage - I don't want to talk about that.\par
\par
    I've only two requests to make, Doctor. When the taxonomists classify this \par
creature , I hope they'll name it after me.\par
\par
    And - when the next ship comes home - ask them to take our bones back to \par
China.\par
\par
    I'll lose power in a few minutes - wish I knew whether anyone was receiving \par
me. Anyway, I'll repeat this message as long as I can...\par
\par
    This is Professor Chang on Europa, reporting the destruction of the \par
spaceship Tsien. We landed beside the Grand Canal and set up our pumps at the \par
edge of the ice -\par

The Little Dawn\par
\par
    \par
\par
    MISS PRINGLE RECORD\par
\par
    Here comes the Sun! Strange - how quickly it seems to rise, on this slowly \par
turning world! Of course, of course - the disc's so small that the whole of it \par
pops above the horizon in no time... Not that it makes much difference to the \par
light - if you weren't looking in that direction, you'd never notice that there \par
was another sun in the sky.\par
\par
    But I hope the Europs have noticed. Usually it takes them less than five \par
minutes to start coming ashore after the Little Dawn. Wonder if they already \par
know I'm here, and are scared...\par
\par
    No - could be the other way round. Perhaps they're inquisitive - even \par
anxious to see what strange visitor has come to Tsienville... I rather hope \par
so...\par
\par
    Here they come! Hope your spysats are watching - Falcon's cameras \par
recording...\par
\par
    How slowly they move! I'm afraid it's going to be very boring trying to \par
communicate with them... even if they want to talk to me...\par
\par
    Rather like the thing that overturned Tsien, but much smaller... They remind \par
me of little trees, walking on half a dozen slender trunks. And with hundreds of \par
branches, dividing into twigs, which divide again... and again. Just like many \par
of our general-purpose robots... what a long time it took us to realize that \par
imitation humanoids were ridiculously clumsy, and the proper way to go was with \par
myriad of small manipulators! Whenever we invent something clever, we find that \par
Mother Nature's already thought of it...\par
\par
    Aren't the little ones cute - like tiny bushes on the move. Wonder how they \par
reproduce - budding? I hadn't realized how beautiful they are. Almost as \par
colourful as coral reef fish - maybe for the same reasons... to attract mates, \par
or fool predators by pretending to be something else...\par
\par
    Did I say they looked like bushes? Make that rose-bushes - they've actually \par
got thorns! Must have a good reason for them...\par
\par
    I'm disappointed. They don't seem to have noticed me. They'll all heading \par
into town, as if a visiting spacecraft was an everyday occurrence... only a few \par
left... maybe this will work...\par
\par
    I suppose they can detect sound vibrations - most marine creatures can - \par
though this atmosphere may be too thin to carry my voice very far...\par
\par

\par
    HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME? MY NAME IS FRANK POOLE... AHEM... I COME IN PEACE \par
FOR ALL MANKIND...\par
\par
    Makes me feel rather stupid, but can you suggest anything better? And it \par
will be good for the record...\par
\par
    Nobody's taking the slightest notice. Big ones and little ones, they re all \par
creeping towards their igloos Wonder what they actually do when they get there - \par
perhaps I should follow. I'm sure it would be perfectly safe - I can move so \par
much faster - I've just had an amusing flashback. All these creatures going in \par
the same direction - they look like the commuters who used to surge back and \par
forth twice a day between home and office, before electronics made it \par
unnecessary. Let's try again, before they all disappear.\par
\par
    \par
\par
    HELLO THERE THIS IS FRANK POOLE, A VISITOR FROM PLANET EARTH. CAN YOU HEAR \par
ME?\par
\par
    I HEAR YOU, FRANK. THIS IS DAVE.\par
\par
    \par

The Ghosts in the Machine\par
\par
    \par
\par
    Frank Poole's immediate reaction was one of utter astonishment, followed by \par
overwhelming joy. He had never really believed that he would make any kind of \par
contact, either with the Europs or the Monolith. Indeed, he had even had \par
fantasies of kicking in frustration against that towering ebon wall and shouting \par
angrily, 'Is there anybody home?'\par
\par
    Yet he should not have been so amazed: some intelligence must have monitored \par
his approach from Ganymede, and permitted him to land. He should have taken Ted \par
Khan more seriously.\par
\par
    'Dave,' he said slowly, 'is that really you?'\par
\par
    Who else could it be? a part of his mind asked. Yet it was not a foolish \par
question. There was something curiously mechanical - impersonal about the voice \par
that came from the small speaker on Falcon's control board.\par
\par
    YES, FRANK. I AM DAVE.\par
\par
    There was a very brief pause: then the same voice continued, without any \par
change of intonation:\par
\par
    HELLO FRANK. THIS IS HAL.\par
\par
    \par
\par
    MISS PRINGLE\par
\par
    RECORD\par
\par
    Well - Indra, Dim - I'm glad I recorded all that, otherwise you'd never \par
believe me...\par
\par
    I guess I'm still in a state of shock. First of all, how should I feel about \par
someone who tried to - who did - kill me - even if it was a thousand years ago! \par
But I understand now that Hal wasn't to blame; nobody was. There's a very good \par
piece of advice I've often found useful 'Never attribute to malevolence what is \par
merely due to incompetence' I can't feel any anger towards a bunch of \par
programmers I never knew, who've been dead for centuries.\par
\par
    I'm glad this is encrypted, as I don't know how it should be handled, and a \par
lot that I tell you may turn out to be complete nonsense. I'm already suffering \par
from information overload, and had to ask Dave to leave me for a while - after \par
all the trouble I've gone through to meet him! But I don't think I hurt his \par
feelings: I m not sure yet if he has any feelings...\par
\par
    What is he - good question! Well, he really is Dave Bowman, but with most of \par
the humanity stripped away - like - ah - like the synopsis of a book or a \par
technical paper. You know how an abstract can give all the basic information  \par
but no hint of the author's personality? Yet there were moments when I felt that \par
something of the old Dave was still there. I wouldn't go so far as to say he's \par
pleased to meet me again - moderately satisfied might be more like it... For \par
myself, I'm still very confused. Like meeting an old friend after a long \par
separation, and finding that they're now a different person. Well, it has been a \par
thousand years - and I can't imagine what experiences he's known, though as I'll \par
show you presently, he's tried to share some of them with me.\par
\par
    And Hal - he's here too, without question. Most of the time, there's no way \par
I can tell which of them is speaking to me. Aren't there examples of multiple \par
personalities in the medical records? Maybe it's something like that.\par
\par
    I asked him how this had happened to them both, and he - they - dammit, \par
Halman! - tried to explain. Let me repeat - I may have got it partly wrong, but \par
it's the only working hypothesis I have.\par
\par
    Of course, the Monolith - in its various manifestations - is the key - no, \par
that's the wrong word - didn't someone once say it was a kind of cosmic Swiss \par
Army knife? You still have them, I've noticed, though both Switzerland and its \par
army disappeared centuries ago. It's a general-purpose device that can do \par
anything it wants to. Or was programmed to do...\par
\par
    Back in Africa, four million years ago, it gave us that evolutionary kick in \par
the pants, for better or for worse. Then its sibling on the Moon waited for us \par
to climb out of the cradle. That we've already guessed, and Dave's confirmed it.\par
\par
    I said that he doesn't have many human feelings, but he still has curiosity \par
- he wants to learn. And what an opportunity he's had!\par
\par
    When the Jupiter Monolith absorbed him - can't think of a better word - it \par
got more than it bargained for. Though it used him - apparently as a captured \par
specimen, and a probe to investigate Earth - he's also been using it. With Hal's \par
assistance - and who should understand a super-computer better than another one? \par
- he's been exploring its memory, and trying to find its purpose.\par
\par
    Now, this is something that's very hard to believe. The Monolith is a \par
fantastically powerful machine - look what it did to Jupiter! - but it's no more \par
than that. It's running on automatic - it has no consciousness. I remember once \par
thinking that I might have to kick the Great Wall and shout 'Is there anyone \par
there?' And the correct answer would have to be - no one, except Dave and Hal...\par
\par
    Worse still, some of its systems may have started to fail; Dave even \par
suggests that, in a fundamental way, it's become stupid! Perhaps it's been left \par
on its own for too long - it's time for a service check.\par
\par
    And he believes the Monolith has made at least one misjudgement. Perhaps \par
that's not the right word - it may have been deliberate, carefully considered...\par
\par
    In any event, it's - well, truly awesome, and terrifying in its \par
implications. Luckily, I can show it to you, so you can decide for yourselves. \par
Yes, even though it happened a thousand years ago, when Leonov flew the second \par
mission to Jupiter! And all this time, no one has ever guessed...\par
\par
    I'm certainly glad you got me fitted with the Braincap. Of course it's been \par
invaluable - I can't imagine life without it - but now it's doing a job it was \par
never designed for. And doing it remarkably well.\par
\par
    It took Halman about ten minutes to find how it worked, and to set up an \par
interface. Now we have mind-to-mind contact - which is quite a strain on me, I \par
can tell you. I have to keep asking them to slow down, and use baby-talk. Or \par
should I say baby-think...\par
\par
    I'm not sure how well this will come through. It's a thousand-year-old \par
recording of Dave's own experience, somehow stored in the Monolith's enormous \par
memory, then retrieved by Dave and injected into my Braincap - don't ask me \par
exactly how - and finally transferred and beamed to you by Ganymede Central. \par
Phew. Hope you don't get a headache downloading it.\par
\par
    Over to Dave Bowman at Jupiter, early twenty-first century...\par

Foamscape\par
\par
    \par
\par
    The million-kilometre-long tendrils of magnetic force, the sudden explosion \par
of radio waves, the geysers of electrified plasma wider than the planet Earth - \par
they were as real and clearly visible to him as the clouds banding the planet in \par
multi-hued glory. He could understand the complex pattern of their interactions, \par
and realized that Jupiter was much more wonderful than anyone had ever guessed.\par
\par
    Even as he fell through the roaring heart of the Great Red Spot, with the \par
lightning of its continent-wide thunderstorms detonating under him, he knew why \par
it had persisted for centuries though it was made of gases far less substantial \par
than those that formed the hurricanes of Earth. The thin scream of hydrogen wind \par
faded as he sank into the calmer depths, and a sheet of waxen snowflakes - some \par
already coalescing into barely palpable mountains of hydrocarbon foam - \par
descended from the heights above. It was already warm enough for liquid water to \par
exist, but there were no oceans there; this purely gaseous environment was too \par
tenuous to support them.\par
\par
    He descended through layer after layer of cloud, until he entered a region \par
of such clarity that even human vision could have scanned an area more than a \par
thousand kilometres across. It was only a minor eddy in the vaster gyre of the \par
Great Red Spot; and it held a secret that men had long guessed, but never \par
proved. Skirting the foothills of the drifting foam mountains were myriad of \par
small, sharply defined clouds, all about the same size and patterned with \par
similar red and brown mottling. They were small only as compared with the \par
inhuman scale of their surroundings; the very least would have covered a fair-\par
sized city.\par
\par
    They were clearly alive, for they were moving with slow deliberation along \par
the flanks of the aerial mountains, browsing off their slopes like colossal \par
sheep. And they were calling to each other in the metre band, their radio voices \par
faint but clear against the cracklings and concussions of Jupiter itself.\par
\par
    Nothing less than living gasbags, they floated in the narrow zone between \par
freezing heights and scorching depths. Narrow, yes - but a domain far larger \par
than all the biosphere of Earth.\par
\par
    They were not alone. Moving swiftly among them were other creatures so small \par
that they could easily have been overlooked. Some of them bore an almost uncanny \par
resemblance to terrestrial aircraft, and were of about the same size. But they \par
too were alive - perhaps predators, perhaps parasites, perhaps even herdsmen.\par
\par
    A whole new chapter of evolution, as alien as that which he had glimpsed on \par
Europa, was opening before him. There were jet-propelled torpedoes like the \par
squids of the terrestrial oceans, hunting and devouring the huge gas-bags. But \par
the balloons were not defenceless; some of them fought back with electric \par
thunderbolts and with clawed tentacles like kilometre-long chainsaws.\par
\par
    There were even stranger shapes, exploiting almost every possibility of \par
geometry - bizarre, translucent kites, tetrahedra, spheres, polyhedra, tangles \par
of twisted ribbons... The gigantic plankton of the Jovian atmosphere, they were \par
designed to float like gossamer in the uprising currents, until they had lived \par
long enough to reproduce; then they would be swept down into the depths to be \par
carbonized and recycled in a new generation.\par
\par
    He was searching a world more than a hundred times the area of Earth, and \par
though he saw many wonders, nothing there hinted of intelligence. The radio \par
voices of the great balloons carried only simple messages of warning or of fear. \par
Even the hunters, who might have been expected to develop higher degrees of \par
organization, were like the sharks in Earth's oceans - mindless automata.\par
\par
    And for all its breathtaking size and novelty, the biosphere of Jupiter was \par
a fragile world, a place of mists and foam, of delicate silken threads and \par
paper-thin tissues spun from the continual snowfall of petrochemicals formed by \par
lightning in the upper atmosphere. Few of its constructs were more substantial \par
than soap bubbles; its most awesome predators could be torn to shreds by even \par
the feeblest of terrestrial carnivores.\par
\par
    Like Europa, but on a vastly grander scale, Jupiter was an evolutionary cul-\par
de-sac. Intelligence would never emerge here; even if it did, it would be doomed \par
to a stunted existence. A purely aerial culture might develop, but in an \par
environment where fire was impossible, and solids scarcely existed, it could \par
never even reach the Stone Age.\par

\par
    MISS PRINGLE RECORD\par
\par
    Well, Indra - Dim - I hope that came through in good shape - I still find it \par
hard to believe. All those fantastic creatures - surely we should have detected \par
their radio voices, even if we couldn't understand them! - wiped out in a \par
moment, so that Jupiter could be made into a sun.\par
\par
    And now we can understand why. It was to give the Europs their chance. What \par
pitiless logic: is intelligence the only thing that matters? I can see some long \par
arguments with Ted Khan over this - The next question is: will the Europs make \par
the grade - or will they remain forever stuck in the kindergarten - not even \par
that - the nursery? Though a thousand years is a very short time, one would have \par
expected some progress, but according to Dave they're exactly the same now as \par
when they left the sea. Perhaps that's the trouble; they still have one foot - \par
or one twig! - in the water.\par
\par
    And here's another thing we got completely wrong. We thought they went back \par
into the water to sleep. It's just the other way round - they go back to eat, \par
and sleep when they come on land! As we might have guessed from their structure \par
- that network of branches - they're plankton feeders...\par
\par
    I asked Dave about the igloos they've built. Aren't they a technological \par
advance? And he said: not really - they're only adaptations of structures they \par
make on the sea-bed, to protect themselves from various predators - especially \par
something like a flying carpet, as big as a football field...\par
\par
    There's one area, though, where they have shown initiative - even \par
creativity. They're fascinated by metals, presumably because they don't exist in \par
pure form in the ocean. That's why Tsien was stripped - the same thing's \par
happened to the occasional probes that have come down in their territory. What \par
do they do with the copper and beryllium and titanium they collect? Nothing \par
useful, I'm afraid. They pile it all together in one place, in a fantastic heap \par
that they keep reassembling. They could be developing an aesthetic sense - I've \par
seen worse in the Museum of Modem Art... But I've got another theory - did you \par
ever hear of cargo cults? During the twentieth century, some of the few \par
primitive tribes that still existed made imitation aeroplanes out of bamboo, in \par
the hope of attracting the big birds in the sky that occasionally brought them \par
wonderful gifts. Perhaps the Europs have the same idea.\par
\par
    Now that question you keep asking me... What is Dave? And how did he - and \par
Hal - become whatever it is they are now?\par
\par
    The quick answer, of course, is that they're both emulations - simulations - \par
in the Monolith's gigantic memory. Most of the time they're inactivated; when I \par
asked Dave about this, he said he'd been 'awake' - his actual word -for only \par
fifty years altogether, in the thousand since his - er - metamorphosis.\par
\par
    When I asked if he resented this takeover of his life, he said, 'Why should \par
I resent it? I am performing my functions perfectly.' Yes, that sounds exactly \par
like Hal! But I believe it was Dave - if there's any distinction now.\par
\par
    Remember that Swiss Army knife analogy? Halman is one of this cosmic knife's \par
myriad of components.\par
\par
    But he's not a completely passive tool - when he's awake, he has some \par
autonomy, some independence - presumably within limits set by the Monolith's \par
overriding control. During the centuries, he's been used as a kind of \par
intelligent probe to examine, Jupiter - as you've just seen - as well as \par
Ganymede and the Earth. That confirms those mysterious events in Florida, \par
reported by Dave's old girl-friend, and the nurse who was looking after his \par
mother, just moments before her death... as well as the encounters in Anubis \par
City.\par
\par
    And it also explains another mystery. I asked Dave directly: why was I \par
allowed to land on Europa, when everyone else has been turned away for \par
centuries? I fully expected to be!\par
\par
    The answer's ridiculously simple. The Monolith uses Dave - Halman - from \par
time to time, to keep an eye on us.\par
\par
    Dave knew all about my rescue - even saw some of the media interviews I \par
made, on Earth and on Ganymede. I must say I'm still a little hurt he made no \par
attempt to contact me! But at least he put out the Welcome mat when I did \par
arrive...\par
\par
    Dim - I still have forty-eight hours before Falcon leaves - with or without \par
me! I don't think I'll need them, now I've made contact with Halman; we can keep \par
in touch just as easily from Anubis... if he wants to do so.\par
\par
    And I'm anxious to get back to the Grannymede as quickly as possible. \par
Falcon's a fine little spacecraft, but her plumbing could be improved - it's \par
beginning to smell in here, and I'm itching for a shower.\par
\par
    Look forward to seeing you - and especially Ted Khan.\par

    On the whole, it had been an interesting but uneventful decades, punctuated \par
by the joys and sorrows which Time and Fate bring to all mankind. The greatest \par
of those had been wholly unexpected; in fact, before he left for Ganymede, Poole \par
would have dismissed the very idea as preposterous.\par
\par
    There is much truth in the saying that absence makes the heart grow fonder. \par
When he and Indra Wallace met again, they discovered that, despite their \par
bantering and occasional disagreements, they were closer than they had imagined. \par
One thing led to another including, to their mutual joy, Dawn Wallace and Martin \par
Poole.\par
\par
    It was rather late in life to start a family - quite apart from that little \par
matter of a thousand years - and Professor Anderson had warned them that it \par
might be impossible. Or even worse...\par
\par
    'You were lucky in more ways than you realize,' he told Poole. 'Radiation \par
damage was surprisingly low, and we were able to make all essential repairs from \par
your intact DNA. But until we do some more tests, I can't promise genetic \par
integrity. So enjoy yourselves - but don't start a family until I give the OK.'\par
\par
    The tests had been time-consuming, and as Anderson had feared, further \par
repairs were necessary. There was one major set-back - something that could \par
never have lived, even if it had been allowed to go beyond the first few weeks \par
after conception - but Martin and Dawn were perfect, with just the right number \par
of heads, arms and legs. They were also handsome and intelligent, and barely \par
managed to escape being spoiled by their doting parents - who continued to be \par
the best of friends when, after fifteen years, each opted for independence \par
again. Because of their Social Achievement Rating, they would have been \par
permitted - indeed, encouraged - to have another child, but they decided not to \par
put any more of a burden on their astonishingly good luck.\par
\par
    One tragedy had shadowed Poole's personal life during this period - and \par
indeed had shocked the whole Solar community. Captain Chandler and his entire \par
crew had been lost when the nucleus of a comet they were reconnoitring exploded \par
suddenly, destroying Goliath so completely that only a few fragments were ever \par
located. Such explosions - caused by reactions among unstable molecules which \par
existed at very low temperatures - were a well-known danger to comet-collectors, \par
and Chandler had encountered several during his career. No one would ever know \par
the exact circumstances which caused so experienced a spaceman to be taken by \par
surprise.\par
\par
    Poole missed Chandler very badly: he had played a unique role in his life, \par
and there was no one to replace him - no one, except Dave Bowman, with whom he \par
had shared so momentous an adventure. He and Chandler had often made plans to go \par
into space together again, perhaps all the way out to the Oort Cloud with its \par
unknown mysteries and its remote but inexhaustible wealth of ice. Yet some \par
conflict of schedules had always upset their plans, so this was a wished-for \par
future that would never exist.\par
\par
    Another long-desired goal Poole had managed to achieve - despite doctor's \par
orders. He had been down to Earth: and once was quite enough.\par
\par
    The vehicle in which he had travelled looked almost identical to the \par
wheelchairs used by the luckier paraplegics of his own time. It was motorized, \par
and had balloon tyres which allowed it to roll over reasonably smooth surfaces. \par
However, it could also fly - at an altitude of about twenty centimetres - on an \par
aircushion produced by a set of small but very powerful fans. Poole was \par
surprised that so primitive a technology was still in use, but inertia-control \par
devices were too bulky for such small-scale applications.\par
\par
    Seated comfortably in his hoverchair, he was scarcely conscious of his \par
increasing weight as he descended into the heart of Africa; though he did notice \par
some difficulty in breathing, he had experienced far worse during his astronaut \par
training. What he was not prepared for was the blast of furnace-heat that smote \par
him as he rolled out of the gigantic, sky-piercing cylinder that formed the base \par
of the Tower. Yet it was still morning: what would it be like at noon?\par
\par
    He had barely accustomed himself to the heat when his sense of smell was \par
assailed. A myriad odours - none unpleasant, but all unfamiliar - clamoured for \par
his attention. He closed his eyes for a few minutes, in an attempt to avoid \par
overloading his input circuits.\par
\par
    Before he had decided to open them again, he felt some large, moist object \par
palpating the back of his neck.\par
\par
    'Say hello to Elizabeth,' said his guide, a burly young man dressed in \par
traditional Great White Hunter garb, much too smart to have seen any real use: \par
'she's our official greeter.'\par
\par
    Poole twisted round in his chair, and found himself looking into the soulful \par
eyes of a baby elephant.\par
\par
    'Hello, Elizabeth,' he answered, rather feebly. Elizabeth lifted her trunk \par
in salute, and emitted a sound not usually heard in polite society, though Poole \par
felt sure it was well-intentioned.\par
\par
    Altogether, he spent less than an hour on Planet Earth, skirting the edge of \par
a jungle whose stunted trees compared unfavourably with Skyland's, and \par
encountering much of the local fauna. His guides apologized for the friendliness \par
of the lions, who had been spoilt by tourists - but the malevolent expressions \par
of the crocodiles more than compensated; here was Nature raw and unchanged.\par
\par
    Before he returned to the Tower, Poole risked taking a few steps away from \par
his hoverchair. He realized that this would be the equivalent of carrying his \par
own weight on his back, but that did not seem an impossible feat, and he would \par
never forgive himself unless he attempted it.\par
\par
    It was not a good idea; perhaps he should have tried it in a cooler climate. \par
After no more than a dozen steps, he was glad to sink back into the luxurious \par
clutches of the chair.\par
\par
    'That's enough,' he said wearily. 'Let's go back to the Tower.'\par
\par
    As he rolled into the elevator lobby, he noticed a sign which he had somehow \par
overlooked during the excitement of his arrival. It read:\par
\par
    \par
\par
    WELCOME TO AFRICA!\par
    'In wildness is the preservation of the world.'\par
    HENRY DAVID THOREAU\par
    (1817-1862)\par
\par
    \par
\par
    Observing Poole's interest, the guide asked 'Did you know him?'\par
\par
    It was the sort of question Poole heard all too often, and at the moment he \par
did not feel equipped to deal with it.\par
\par
    'I don't think so,' he answered wearily, as the great doors closed behind \par
them, shutting out the sights, scents and sounds of Mankind's earliest home.\par
\par
    His vertical safari had satisfied his need to visit Earth, and he did his \par
best to ignore the various aches and pains acquired there when he returned to \par
his apartment at Level 10,000 - a prestigious location, even in this democratic \par
society. Indra, however, was mildly shocked by his appearance, and ordered him \par
straight to bed.\par
\par
    'Just like Antaeus - but in reverse!' she muttered darkly. 'Who?' asked \par
Poole: there were times when his wife's erudition was a little overwhelming, but \par
he had determined never to let it give him an inferiority complex.\par
\par
    'Son of the Earth Goddess, Gaea. Hercules wrestled with him - but every time \par
he was thrown to the ground, Antaeus renewed his strength.'\par
\par
    'Who won?'\par
\par
    'Hercules, of course - by holding Antaeus in the air, so Ma couldn't \par
recharge his batteries.'\par
\par
    'Well, I'm sure it won't take me long to recharge mine. And I've learned one \par
lesson. If I don't get more exercise, I may have to move up to Lunar Gravity \par
level.'\par
\par
    Poole's good resolution lasted a full month: every morning he went for a \par
brisk five-kilometre walk, choosing a different level of the Africa Tower each \par
day. Some floors were still vast, echoing deserts of metal which would probably \par
never be occupied, but others had been landscaped and developed over the \par
centuries in a bewildering variety of architectural styles. Many were borrowings \par
from past ages and cultures; others hinted at futures which Poole would not care \par
to visit. At least there was no danger of boredom, and on many of his walks he \par
was accompanied, at a respectful distance, by small groups of friendly children. \par
They were seldom able to keep up with him for long.\par
\par
    One day, as Poole was striding down a convincing - though sparsely populated \par
- imitation of the Champs Elyse\'b4es, he suddenly spotted a familiar face.\par
\par
    'Danil!' he called.\par
\par
    The other man took not the slightest notice, even when Poole called again, \par
more loudly.\par
\par
    'Don't you remember me?'\par
\par
    Danil - and now that he had caught up with him, Poole did not have the \par
slightest doubt of his identity - looked genuinely baffled.\par
\par
    'I'm sorry,' he said. 'You're Commander Poole, of course. But I'm sure we've \par
never met before.'\par
\par
    Now it was Poole's turn to be embarrassed.\par
\par
    'Stupid of me,' he apologized. 'Must have mistaken you for someone else. \par
Have a good day.'\par
\par
    He was glad of the encounter, and was pleased to know that Danil was back in \par
normal society. Whether his original crime had been axe-murders or overdue \par
library books should no longer be the concern of his one-time employer; the \par
account had been settled, the books closed. Although Poole sometimes missed the \par
cops-and-robbers dramas he had often enjoyed in his youth, he had grown to \par
accept the current wisdom: excessive interest in pathological behaviour was \par
itself pathological.\par
\par
    With the help of Miss Pringle, Mk III, Poole had been able to schedule his \par
life so that there were even occasional blank moments when he could relax and \par
set his Braincap on Random Search, scanning his areas of interest. Outside his \par
immediate family, his chief concerns were still among the moons of \par
Jupiter/Lucifer, not least because he was recognized as the leading expert on \par
the subject, and a permanent member of the Europa Committee.\par
\par
    This had been set up almost a thousand years ago, to consider what, if \par
anything, could and should be done about the mysterious satellite. Over the \par
centuries, it had accumulated a vast amount of information, going all the way \par
back to the Voyager flybys of 1979 and the first detailed surveys from the \par
orbiting Galileo spacecraft of 1996.\par
\par
    Like most long-lived organizations, the Europa Committee had become slowly \par
fossilized, and now met only when there was some new development. It had woken \par
up with a start after Halman's reappearance, and appointed an energetic new \par
chairperson whose first act had been to co-opt Poole.\par
\par
    Though there was little that he could contribute that was not already \par
recorded, Poole was very happy to be on the Committee. It was obviously his duty \par
to make himself available, and it also gave him an official position he would \par
otherwise have lacked. Previously his status was what had once been called a \par
'national treasure', which he found faintly embarrassing. Although he was glad \par
to be supported in luxury by a world wealthier than all the dreams of war-\par
ravaged earlier ages could have imagined, he felt the need to justify his \par
existence.\par
\par
    He also felt another need, which he seldom articulated even to himself. \par
Halman had spoken to him, if only briefly, at their strange encounter two \par
decades ago. Poole was certain that, if he wished, Halman could easily do so \par
again. Were all human contacts no longer of interest to him? He hoped that was \par
not the case; yet that might be one explanation of his silence.\par
\par
    He was frequently in touch with Theodore Khan - as active and acerbic as \par
ever, and now the Europa Committee's representative on Ganymede. Ever since \par
Poole had returned to Earth, Ted had been trying in vain to open a channel of \par
communication with Bowman. He could not understand why long lists of important \par
questions on subjects of vital philosophical and historic interest received not \par
even brief acknowledgements.\par
\par
    'Does the Monolith keep your friend Halman so busy that he can't talk to \par
me?' he complained to Poole. 'What does he do with his time, anyway?'\par
\par
    It was a very reasonable question; and the answer came, like a thunderbolt \par
out of a cloudless sky, from Bowman himself - as a perfectly commonplace \par
vidphone call.\par
\par
    \par
\par
33\par
Contact\par
\par
    \par
\par
    'Hello, Frank. This is Dave. I have a very important message for you. I \par
assume that you are now in your suite in Africa Tower. If you are there, please \par
identify yourself by giving the name of our instructor in orbital mechanics. I \par
will wait for sixty seconds, and if there is no reply will try again in exactly \par
one hour.'\par
\par
    That minute was hardly long enough for Poole to recover from the shock. He \par
felt a brief surge of delight, as well as astonishment, before another emotion \par
took over. Glad though he was to hear from Bowman again, that phrase 'a very \par
important message' sounded distinctly ominous.\par
\par
    At least it was fortunate, Poole told himself, that he's asked for one of \par
the few names I can remember. Yet who could forget a Scot with a Glasgow accent \par
so thick it had taken them a week to master it? But he had been a brilliant \par
lecturer - once you understood what he was saying.\par
\par
    'Dr Gregory McVitty.'\par
\par
    'Accepted. Now please switch on your Braincap receiver. It will take three \par
minutes to download this message. Do not attempt to monitor: I am using ten-to-\par
one compression. I will wait two minutes before starting.'\par
\par
    How is he managing to do this? Poole wondered. Jupiter/Lucifer was now over \par
fifty light-minutes away, so this message must have left almost an hour ago. It \par
must have been sent with an intelligent agent in a properly addressed package on \par
the Ganymede-Earth beam - but that would have been a trivial feat to Halman, \par
with the resources he had apparently been able to tap inside the Monolith.\par
\par
    The indicator light on the Brainbox was flickering. The message was coming \par
through.\par
\par
    At the compression Halman was using, it would take half an hour for Poole to \par
absorb the message in real-time. But he needed only ten minutes to know that his \par
peaceful life-style had come to an abrupt end\par
\par
    \par
\par
34\par
Judgement\par
\par
    \par
\par
    In a world of universal and instantaneous communication, it was very \par
difficult to keep secrets. This was a matter, Poole decided immediately, for \par
face-to-face discussion.\par
\par
    The Europa Committee had grumbled, but all its members had assembled in his \par
apartment. There were seven of them - the lucky number, doubtless suggested by \par
the phases of the Moon, that had always fascinated Mankind. It was the first \par
time Poole had met three of the Committee's members, though by now he knew them \par
all more thoroughly than he could possibly have done in a pre-Braincapped \par
lifetime.\par
\par
    'Chairperson Oconnor, members of the Committee - I'd like to say a few words \par
- only a few, I promise! - before you download the message I've received from \par
Europa. And this is something I prefer to do verbally; that's more natural for \par
me - I'm afraid I'll never be quite at ease with direct mental transfer.'\par
\par
    'As you all know, Dave Bowman and Hal have been stored as emulations in the \par
Monolith on Europa. Apparently it never discards a tool it once found useful, \par
and from time to time it activates Halman, to monitor our affairs - when they \par
begin to concern it. As I suspect my arrival may have done - though perhaps I \par
flatter myself.'\par
\par
    'But Halman isn't just a passive tool. The Dave component still retains \par
something of its human origins - even emotions. And because we were trained \par
together - shared almost everything for years - he apparently finds it much \par
easier to communicate with me than with anyone else. I would like to think he \par
enjoys doing it, but perhaps that's too strong a word.'\par
\par
    'He's also curious - inquisitive - and perhaps a little resentful of the way \par
he's been collected, like a specimen of wildlife. Though that's probably what we \par
are, from the viewpoint of the intelligence that created the Monolith.'\par
\par
    'And where is that intelligence now? Halman apparently knows the answer, and \par
it's a chilling one.'\par
\par
    'As we always suspected, the Monolith is part of a galactic network of some \par
kind. And the nearest node - the Monolith's controller, or immediate superior - \par
is 450 light-years away.'\par
\par
    'Much too close for comfort! This means that the report on us and our \par
affairs that was transmitted early in the twenty-first century was received half \par
a millennium ago. If the Monolith's - let's say Supervisor - replied at once, \par
any further instructions should be arriving just about now.'\par
\par
    'And that's exactly what seems to be happening. During the last few days, \par
the Monolith has been receiving a continuous string of messages, and has been \par
setting up new programs, presumably in accordance with these.'\par
\par
    'Unfortunately, Halman can only make guesses about the nature of those \par
instructions. As you'll gather when you've downloaded this tablet, he has some \par
limited access to many of the Monolith's circuits and memory banks, and can even \par
carry on a kind of dialogue with it. If that's the right word - since you need \par
two people for that! I still can't really grasp the idea that the Monolith, for \par
all its powers, doesn't possess consciousness - doesn't even know that it \par
exists!'\par
\par
    'Halman's been brooding over the problem for a thousand years - on and off - \par
and has come to the same answer that most of us have done. But his conclusion \par
must surely carry far more weight, because of his inside knowledge.'\par
\par
    'Sorry! I wasn't intending to make a joke - but what else could you call \par
it?'\par
\par
    'Whatever went to the trouble of creating us - or at least tinkering with \par
our ancestors' minds and genes - is deciding what to do next. And Halman is \par
pessimistic. No - that's an exaggeration. Let's say he doesn't think much of our \par
chances, but is now too detached an observer to be unduly worried. The future - \par
the survival! - of the human race isn't much more than an interesting problem to \par
him, but he's willing to help.'\par
\par
    Poole suddenly stopped talking, to the surprise of his intent audience.\par
\par
    'That's strange. I've just had an amazing flashback... I'm sure it explains \par
what's happening. Please bear with me.'\par
\par
    'Dave and I were walking together one day, along the beach at the Cape, a \par
few weeks before launch, when we noticed a large beetle lying on the sand. As \par
often happens, it had fallen on its back and was waving its legs in the air, \par
struggling to get right-way-up.'\par
\par
    'I ignored it - we were engaged in some complicated technical discussion - \par
but not Dave. He stepped aside, and carefully flipped it over with his shoe. As \par
it flew away I commented, "Are you sure that was a good idea? Now it will go off \par
and chomp somebody's prize chrysanthemums." And he answered, "Maybe you're \par
right. But I'd like to give it the benefit of the doubt."\par
\par
    'My apologies - I'd promised to say only a few words! But I'm very glad I \par
remembered that incident: I really believe it puts Halman's message in the right \par
perspective. He's giving the human race the benefit of the doubt...'\par
\par
    'Now please check your Braincaps. This is a high-density recording - top of \par
the u.v. band, Channel 110. Make yourselves comfortable, but be sure you're free \par
line of sight. Here we go...'\par
\par
    \par
\par
35\par
Council of War\par
\par
    \par
\par
    No one asked for a replay. Once was sufficient.\par
\par
    There was a brief silence when the playback finished; then Chairperson Dr \par
Oconnor removed her Braincap, massaged her shining scalp, and said slowly:\par
\par
    'You taught me a phrase from your period that seems very appropriate now. \par
This is a can of worms.'\par
\par
    'But only Bowman - Halman - has opened it,' said one of the Committee \par
members. 'Does he really understand the operation of something as complex as the \par
Monolith? Or is this whole scenario a figment of his imagination?'\par
\par
    'I don't think he has much imagination,' Dr Oconnor answered. 'And \par
everything checks perfectly. Especially the reference to Nova Scorpio. We \par
assumed that was an accident; apparently it was a - judgement.'\par
\par
    'First Jupiter - now Scorpio,' said Dr Kraussman, the distinguished \par
physicist who was popularly regarded as a reincarnation of the legendary \par
Einstein. A little plastic surgery, it was rumoured, had also helped. 'Who will \par
be next in line?'\par
\par
    'We always guessed,' said the Chair, 'that the TMAs were monitoring us.' She \par
paused for a moment, then added ruefully: 'What bad - what incredibly bad! - \par
luck that the fmal report went off, just after the very worst period in human \par
history!'\par
\par
    There was another silence. Everyone knew that the twentieth century had \par
often been branded 'The Century of Torture'\par
\par
    Poole listened without interrupting, while he waited for some consensus to \par
emerge. Not for the first time, he was impressed by the quality of the Committee \par
No one was trying to prove a pet theory, score debating points, or inflate an \par
ego: he could not help drawing a contrast with the often bad-tempered arguments \par
he had heard in own time, between Space Agency engineers and administrators, \par
Congressional staffs, and industrial executives.\par
\par
    Yes, the human race had undoubtedly improved. The Braincap had not only \par
helped to weed out misfits, but had enormously increased the efficiency of \par
education. Yet there had also been a loss; there were very few memorable \par
characters in this society. Offhand he could think of only four - Indra, Captain \par
Chandler, Dr Khan and the Dragon Lady of wistful memory.\par
\par
    The Chairperson let the discussion flow smoothly back and forth until \par
everyone had had a say, then began her summing up.\par
\par
    'The obvious first question - how seriously should we take this threat - \par
isn't worth wasting time on. Even if it's a false alarm, or a misunderstanding, \par
it's potentially so grave that we must assume it's real, until we have absolute \par
proof to the contrary. Agreed?'\par
\par
    'Good. And we don't know how much time we have. So we must assume that the \par
danger is immediate. Perhaps Halman may be able to give us some further warning, \par
but by then it may be too late.'\par
\par
    'So the only thing we have to decide is: how can we protect ourselves, \par
against something as powerful as the Monolith? Look what happened to Jupiter! \par
And, apparently, Nova Scorpio...'\par
\par
    'I'm sure that brute force would be useless, though perhaps we should \par
explore that option. Dr Kraussman - how long would it take to build a super-\par
bomb?'\par
\par
    'Assuming that the designs still exist, so that no research is necessary - \par
oh, perhaps two weeks. Thermonuclear weapons are rather simple, and use common \par
materials - after all, they made them back in the Second Millennium! But if you \par
wanted something sophisticated - say an antimatter bomb, or a mini-black-hole - \par
well, that might take a few months.'\par
\par
    'Thank you: could you start looking into it? But as I've said, I don't \par
believe it would work; surely something that can handle such powers must also be \par
able to protect itself against them. So - any other suggestions?'\par
\par
    'Can we negotiate?' one councillor asked, not very hopefully.\par
\par
    'With what... or whom?' Kraussman answered. 'As we've discovered, the \par
Monolith is essentially a pure mechanism, doing just what it's been programmed \par
to do. Perhaps that program is flexible enough to allow of changes, but there's \par
no way we can tell. And we certainly can't appeal to Head Office - that's half a \par
thousand light-years away!'\par
\par
    Poole listened without interrupting; there was nothing he could contribute \par
to the discussion, and indeed much of it was completely over his head. He began \par
to feel an insidious sense of depression, would it have been better, he \par
wondered, not to pass on this information? Then, if it was a false alarm, no one \par
would be any the worse. And if it was not - well, humanity would still have \par
peace of mind, before whatever inescapable doom awaited it.\par
\par
    He was still mulling over these gloomy thoughts when he was suddenly alerted \par
by a familiar phrase.\par
\par
    A quiet little member of the Committee, with a name so long and difficult \par
that Poole had never been able to remember, still less pronounce it, had \par
abruptly dropped just two words into the discussion.\par
\par
    'Trojan Horse!'\par
\par
    There was one of those silences generally described as 'pregnant', then a \par
chorus of 'Why didn't I think of that!' 'Of course!' 'Very good idea!' until the \par
Chairperson, for the first time in the session, had to call for order.\par
\par
    'Thank you, Professor Thirugnanasampanthamoorthy,' said Dr Oconnor, without \par
missing a beat. 'Would you like to be more specific?'\par
\par
    'Certainly. If the Monolith is indeed, as everyone seems to think, \par
essentially a machine without consciousness - and hence with only limited self-\par
monitoring ability - we may already have the weapons that can defeat it. Locked \par
up in the Vault.'\par
\par
    'And a delivery system - Halman!'\par
\par
    'Precisely.'\par
\par
    'Just a minute, Dr T. We know nothing - absolutely nothing - about the \par
Monolith's architecture. How can we be sure that anything our primitive species \par
ever designed would be effective against it?'\par
\par
    'We can't - but remember this. However sophisticated it is, the Monolith has \par
to obey exactly the same universal laws of logic that Aristotle and Boole \par
formulated, centuries ago. That's why it may - no, should! - be vulnerable to \par
the things locked up in the Vault. We have to assemble them in such a way that \par
at least one of them will work. It's our only hope - unless anybody can suggest \par
a better alternative.'\par
\par
    'Excuse me,' said Poole, finally losing patience. 'Will someone kindly tell \par
me - what and where is this famous Vault you're talking about?'\par

Chamber of Horrors\par
\par
    \par
\par
    History is full of nightmares, some natural, some manmade.\par
\par
    By the end of the twenty-first century, most of the natural ones - smallpox, \par
the Black Death, AIDS, the hideous viruses lurking in the African jungle - had \par
been eliminated, or at least brought under control, by the advance of medicine. \par
However, it was never wise to underestimate the ingenuity of Mother Nature, and \par
no one doubted that the future would still have unpleasant biological surprises \par
in store for Mankind.\par
\par
    It seemed a sensible precaution, therefore, to keep a few specimens of all \par
these horrors for scientific study - carefully guarded, of course, so that there \par
was no possibility of them escaping and again wreaking havoc on the human race. \par
But how could one be absolutely sure that there was no danger of this happening?\par
\par
    There had been - understandably - quite an outcry in the late twentieth \par
century when it was proposed to keep the last known smallpox viruses at Disease \par
Control Centres in the United States and Russia. However unlikely it might be, \par
there was a finite possibility that they might be released by such accidents as \par
earthquakes, equipment failures - or even deliberate sabotage by terrorist \par
groups.\par
\par
    A solution that satisfied everyone (except a few 'Preserve the lunar \par
wilderness!' extremists) was to ship them to the Moon, and to keep them in a \par
laboratory at the end of a kilometre-long shaft drilled into the isolated \par
mountain Pico, one of the most prominent features of the Mare Imbrium. And here, \par
over the years, they were joined by some of the most outstanding examples of \par
misplaced human ingenuity - indeed, insanity.\par
\par
    There were gases and mists that, even in microscopic doses, caused slow or \par
instant death. Some had been created by religious cultists who, though mentally \par
deranged, had managed to acquire considerable scientific knowledge. Many of them \par
believed that the end of the world was at hand (when, of course, only their \par
followers would be saved). In case God was absent-minded enough not to perform \par
as scheduled, they wanted to make sure that they could rectify His unfortunate \par
oversight.\par
\par
    The first assaults of these lethal cultists were made on such vulnerable \par
targets as crowded subways, World Fairs, sports stadiums, pop concerts... tens \par
of thousands were killed, and many more injured before the madness was brought \par
under control in the early twenty-first century. As often happens, some good \par
came out of evil, because it forced the world's law-enforcement agencies to co-\par
operate as never before; even rogue states which had promoted political \par
terrorism were unable to tolerate this random and wholly unpredictable variety.\par
\par
    The chemical and biological agents used in these attacks - as well as in \par
earlier forms of warfare - joined the deadly collection in Pico. Their \par
antidotes, when they existed, were also stored with them. It was hoped that none \par
of this material would ever concern humanity again - but it was still available, \par
under heavy guard, if it was needed in some desperate emergency.\par
\par
    The third category of items stored in the Pico vault, although they could be \par
classified as plagues, had never killed or injured anyone - directly. They had \par
not even existed before the late twentieth century, but in a few decades they \par
had done billions of dollars' worth of damage, and often wrecked lives as \par
effectively as any bodily illness could have done. They were the diseases which \par
attacked Mankind's newest and most versatile servant, the computer.\par
\par
    Taking names from the medical dictionaries - viruses, prions, tapeworms - \par
they were programs that often mimicked, with uncanny accuracy, the behaviour of \par
their organic relatives. Some were harmless - little more than playful jokes, \par
contrived to surprise or amuse Computer operators by unexpected messages and \par
images on their visual displays. Others were far more malicious - deliberately \par
designed agents of catastrophe.\par
\par
    In most cases their purpose was entirely mercenary; they were the weapons \par
that sophisticated criminals used to blackmail the banks and commercial \par
organizations that now depended utterly upon the efficient operation of their \par
computer systems. On being warned that their data banks would be erased \par
automatically at a certain time, unless they transferred a few megadollars to \par
some anonymous offshore number, most victims decided not to risk possibly \par
irreparable disaster. They paid up quietly, often - to avoid public or even \par
private embarrassment - without notifying the police.\par
\par
    This understandable desire for privacy made it easy for the network \par
highwaymen to conduct their electronic holdups: even when they were caught, they \par
were treated gently by legal systems which did not know how to handle such novel \par
crimes - and, after all, they had not really hurt anyone, had they? Indeed, \par
after they had served their brief sentences, many of the perpetrators were \par
quietly hired by their victims, on the old principle that poachers make the best \par
game-keepers.\par
\par
    These computer criminals were driven purely by greed, and certainly did not \par
wish to destroy the organizations they preyed upon: no sensible parasite kills \par
its host. But there were other, and much more dangerous, enemies of society at \par
work...\par
\par
    Usually, they were maladjusted individuals - typically adolescent males - \par
working entirely alone, and of course in complete secrecy. Their aim was to \par
create programs which would simply create havoc and confusion, when they had \par
been spread over the planet by the world-wide cable and radio networks, or on \par
physical carriers such as diskettes and CD ROMS. Then they would enjoy the \par
resulting chaos, basking in the sense of power it gave their pitiful psyches.\par
\par
    Sometimes, these perverted geniuses were discovered and adopted by national \par
intelligence agencies for their own secretive purposes - usually, to break into \par
the data banks of their rivals. This was a fairly harmless line of employment, \par
as the organizations concerned did at least have some sense of civic \par
responsibility.\par
\par
    Not so the apocalyptic sects, who were delighted to discover this new \par
armoury, holding weapons far more effective, and more easily disseminated, than \par
gas or germs. And much more difficult to counter, since they could be broadcast \par
instantaneously to millions of offices and homes.\par
\par
    The collapse of the New York-Havana Bank in 2005, the launching of Indian \par
nuclear missiles in 2007 (luckily with their warheads unactivated), the shutdown \par
of Pan-European Air Traffic Control in 2008, the paralysis of the North American \par
telephone network in that same year - all these were cult-inspired rehearsals \par
for Doomsday. Thanks to brilliant feats of counterintelligence by normally \par
uncooperative, and even warring, national agencies, this menace was slowly \par
brought under control.\par
\par
    At least, so it was generally believed: there had been no serious attacks at \par
the very foundations of society for several hundred years. One of the chief \par
weapons of victory had been the Braincap - though there were some who believed \par
that this achievement had been bought at too great a cost.\par
\par
    Though arguments over the freedom of the Individual versus the duties of the \par
State were old when Plato and Aristotle attempted to codify them, and would \par
probably continue until the end of time, some consensus had been reached in the \par
Third Millennium. It was generally agreed that Communism was the most perfect \par
form of government; unfortunately it had been demonstrated - at the cost of some \par
hundreds of millions of lives - that it was only applicable to social insects, \par
Robots Class II, and similar restricted categories. For imperfect human beings, \par
the least-worst answer was Demosocracy, frequently defined as 'individual greed, \par
moderated by an efficient but not too zealous government'.\par
\par
    Soon after the Braincap came into general use, some highly intelligent - and \par
maximally zealous - bureaucrats realized that it had a unique potential as an \par
early-warning system. During the setting-up process, when the new wearer was \par
being mentally 'calibrated' it was possible to detect many forms of psychosis \par
before they had a chance of becoming dangerous. Often this suggested the best \par
therapy, but when no cure appeared possible the subject could be electronically \par
tagged - or, in extreme cases, segregated from society. Of course, this mental \par
monitoring could test only those who were fitted with a Braincap - but by the \par
end of the Third Millennium this was as essential for everyday life as the \par
personal telephone had been at its beginning. In fact, anyone who did not join \par
the vast majority was automatically suspect, and checked as a potential deviant.\par
\par
    Needless to say, when 'mind-probing', as its critics called it, started \par
coming into general use, there were cries of outrage from civil-rights \par
organizations; one of their most effective slogans was 'Braincap or Braincop?' \par
Slowly - even reluctantly - it was accepted that this form of monitoring was a \par
necessary precaution against far worse evils; and it was no coincidence that \par
with the general improvement in mental health, religious fanaticism also started \par
its rapid decline-\par
\par
    When the long-drawn-out war against the cybernet criminals ended, the \par
victors found themselves owning an embarrassing collection of spoils, all of \par
them utterly incomprehensible to any past conqueror. There were, of course, \par
hundreds of computer viruses, most of them very difficult to detect and kill. \par
And there were some entities - for want of a better name - that were much more \par
terrifying. They were brilliantly invented diseases for which there was no cure \par
- in some cases not even the possibility of a cure\par
\par
    Many of them had been linked to great mathematicians who would have been \par
horrified by this corruption of their discoveries. As it is a human \par
characteristic to belittle a real danger by giving it an absurd name, the \par
designations were often facetious: the Godel Gremlin, the Mandelbrot Maze, the \par
Combinatorial Catastrophe, the Transfinite Trap, the Conway Conundrum, the \par
Turing Torpedo, the Lorentz Labyrinth, the Boolean Bomb, the Shannon Snare, the \par
Cantor Cataclysm...\par
\par
    If any generalization was possible, all these mathematical horrors operated \par
on the same principle. They did not depend for their effectiveness on anything \par
as na\'efve as memory-erasure or code corruption - on the contrary. Their approach \par
was more subtle; they persuaded their host machine to initiate a program which \par
could not be completed before the end of the universe, or which - the Mandelbrot \par
Maze was the deadliest example - involved a literally infinite series of steps.\par
\par
    A trivial example would be the calculation of Pi, or any other irrational \par
number. However, even the most stupid electro-optic computer would not fall into \par
such a simple trap: the day had long since passed when mechanical morons would \par
wear out their gears, grinding them to powder as they tried to divide by zero...\par
\par
    The challenge to the demon programmers was to convince their targets that \par
the task set them had a definite conclusion that could be reached in a finite \par
time. In the battle of wits between man (seldom woman, despite such role-models \par
as Lady Ada Lovelace, Admiral Grace Hopper and Dr Susan Calvin) and machine, the \par
machine almost invariably lost.\par
\par
    It would have been possible - though in some cases difficult and even risky \par
- to destroy the captured obscenities by ERASE/OVERWRITE commands, but they \par
represented an enormous investment in time and ingenuity which, however \par
misguided, seemed a pity to waste. And, more important, perhaps they should be \par
kept for study, in some secure location, as a safeguard against the time when \par
some evil genius might reinvent and deploy them.\par
\par
    The solution was obvious. The digital demons should be sealed with their \par
chemical and biological counterparts, it was hoped for ever, in the Pico Vault.\par
\par
    \par
\par
37\par
Operation Damocles\par
\par
    \par
\par
    Poole never had much contact with the team who assembled the weapon everyone \par
hoped would never have to be used. The operation - ominously, but aptly, named \par
Damocles - was so highly specialized that he could contribute nothing directly, \par
and he saw enough of the task force to realize that some of them might almost \par
belong to an alien species. Indeed, one key member was apparently in a lunatic \par
asylum - Poole had been surprised to find that such places still existed - and \par
Chairperson Oconnor sometimes suggested that at least two others should join \par
him.\par
\par
    'Have you ever heard of the Enigma Project?' she remarked to Poole, after a \par
particularly frustrating session. When he shook his head, she continued: 'I'm \par
surprised - it was only a few decades before you were born: I came across it \par
while when I was researching material for Damocles. Very similar problem - in \par
one of your wars, a group of brilliant mathematicians was gathered together, in \par
great secrecy, to break an enemy code... incidentally, they built one of the \par
very first real computers, to make the job possible.'\par
\par
    'And there's a lovely story - I hope it's true - that reminds me of our own \par
little team. One day the Prime Minister came on a visit of inspection, and \par
afterwards he said to Enigma's Director: "When I told you to leave no stone \par
unturned to get the men you needed, I didn't expect you to take me so \par
literally".'\par
\par
    Presumably all the right stones had been turned for Project Damocles. \par
However, as no one knew whether they were working against a deadline of days, \par
weeks or years, at first it was hard to generate any sense of urgency. The need \par
for secrecy also created problems; since there was no point in spreading alarm \par
throughout the Solar System, not more than fifty people knew of the project. But \par
they were the people who mattered - who could marshal all the forces necessary, \par
and who alone could authorize the opening of the Pico Vault, for the first time \par
in five hundred years.\par
\par
    When Halman reported that the Monolith was receiving messages with \par
increasing frequency, there seemed little doubt that something was going to \par
happen. Poole was not the only one who found it hard to sleep in those days, \par
even with the help of the Braincap's anti-insomnia programs. Before he finally \par
did get to sleep, he often wondered if he would wake up again. But at last all \par
the components of the weapon were assembled - a weapon invisible, untouchable \par
and unimaginable to almost all the warriors who had ever lived.\par
\par
    Nothing could have looked more harmless and innocent than the perfectly \par
standard terabyte memory tablet, used with millions of Braincaps every day. But \par
the fact that it was encased in a massive block of crystalline material, criss-\par
crossed with metal bands, indicated that it was something quite out of the \par
ordinary. Poole received it with reluctance; he wondered if the courier who had \par
been given the awesome task of carrying the Hiroshima atom bomb's core to the \par
Pacific airbase from which it was launched had felt the same way. And yet, if \par
all their fears were justified, his responsibility might be even greater.\par
\par
    And he could not be certain that even the first part of his mission would be \par
successful. Because no circuit could be absolutely secure, Halman had not yet \par
been informed about Project Damocles; Poole would do that when he returned to \par
Ganymede.\par
\par
    Then he could only hope that Halman would be willing to play the role of \par
Trojan Horse - and, perhaps, be destroyed in the process.\par
\par
    \par
\par
38\par
Pre-emptive Strike\par
\par
    \par
\par
    It was strange to be back in the Hotel Grannymede after all these years - \par
strangest of all, because it seemed completely unchanged, despite everything \par
that had happened. Poole was still greeted by the familiar image of Bowman as he \par
walked into the suite named after him: and, as he expected, Bowman/Halman was \par
waiting, looking slightly less substantial than the ancient hologram.\par
\par
    Before they could even exchange greetings, there was an interruption that \par
Poole would have welcomed - at any other time than this. The room vidphone gave \par
its urgent trio of rising notes - also unchanged since his last visit -and an \par
old friend appeared on the screen.\par
\par
    'Frank!' cried Theodore Khan, 'why didn't you tell me you were coming! When \par
can we meet? Why no video - someone with you? And who were all those official-\par
looking types who landed at the same time -'\par
\par
    'Please Ted! Yes, I'm sorry - but believe me, I've got very good reasons - \par
I'll explain later. And I do have someone with me - call you back just as soon \par
as I can. Good-bye!'\par
\par
    As he belatedly gave the 'Do Not Disturb' order, Poole said apologetically: \par
'Sorry about that - you know who it was, of course.'\par
\par
    'Yes - Dr Khan. He often tried to get in touch with me.'\par
\par
    'But you never answered. May I ask why?' Though there were far more \par
important matters to worry about, Poole could not resist putting the question.\par
\par
    'Ours was the only channel I wished to keep open. Also, I was often away. \par
Sometimes for years.'\par
\par
    That was surprising - yet it should not have been. Poole knew well enough \par
that Halman had been reported in many places, in many times. Yet - 'away for \par
years'? He might have visited quite a few star systems - perhaps that was how he \par
knew about Nova Scorpio, only forty light-years distant. But he could never have \par
gone all the way to the Node; there and back would have been a nine-hundred-year \par
journey.\par
\par
    'How lucky that you were here when we needed you!' It was very unusual for \par
Halman to hesitate before replying. There was much longer than the unavoidable \par
three-second time-lag before he said slowly 'Are you sure that it was luck?'\par
\par
    'What do you mean?'\par
\par
    'I do not wish to talk about it, but twice I have - glimpsed - powers - \par
entities - far superior to the Monoliths, and perhaps even their makers. We may \par
both have less freedom than we imagine.'\par
\par
    That was indeed a chilling thought; Poole needed a deliberate effort of will \par
to put it aside and concentrate on the immediate problem.\par
\par
    'Let us hope we have enough free-will to do what is necessary. Perhaps this \par
is a foolish question. Does the Monolith know that we are meeting? Could it be - \par
suspicious?'\par
\par
    'It is not capable of such an emotion. It has numerous fault-protection \par
devices, some of which I understand. But that is all.'\par
\par
    'Could it be overhearing us now?'\par
\par
    'I do not believe so.'\par
\par
    I wish that I could be sure it was such a na\'efve and simple-minded super-\par
genius, thought Poole as he unlocked his briefcase and took out the sealed box \par
containing the tablet. In this low gravity its weight was almost negligible; it \par
was impossible to believe that it might hold the destiny of Mankind.\par
\par
    'There was no way we could be certain of getting a secure circuit to you, so \par
we couldn't go into details. This tablet contains programs which we hope will \par
prevent the Monolith from carrying out any orders which threaten Mankind. There \par
are twenty of the most devastating viruses ever designed on this, most of which \par
have no known antidote; in some cases, it is believed that none is possible. \par
There are five copies of each. We would like you to release them when - and if - \par
you think it is necessary. Dave - Hal - no one has ever been given such a \par
responsibility. But we have no other choice.'\par
\par
    Once again, the reply seemed to take longer than the three-second round trip \par
from Europa.\par
\par
    'If we do this, all the Monolith's functions may cease. We are uncertain \par
what will happen to us then.'\par
\par
    'We have considered that, of course. But by this lime, you must surely have \par
many facilities at your command -some of them probably beyond our understanding. \par
I am also sending you a petabyte memory tablet. Ten to the fifteenth bytes is \par
more than sufficient to hold all the memories and experiences of many lifetimes. \par
This will give you one escape route: I suspect you have others.'\par
\par
    'Correct. We will decide which to use at the appropriate time.'\par
\par
    Poole relaxed - as far as was possible in this extraordinary situation. \par
Halman was willing to co-operate: he still had sufficient links with his \par
origins.\par
\par
    'Now, we have to get this tablet to you - physically. Its contents are too \par
dangerous to risk sending over any radio or optical channel. I know you possess \par
long-range control of matter: did you not once detonate an orbiting bomb? Could \par
you transport it to Europa? Alternatively, we could send it in an auto-courier, \par
to any point you specify.'\par
\par
    'That would be best: I will collect it in Tsienville. Here are the co-\par
ordinates...\par
\par
    \par
\par
    Poole was still slumped in his chair when the Bowman Suite monitor admitted \par
the head of the delegation that had accompanied him from Earth. Whether Colonel \par
Jones was a genuine Colonel - or even if his name was Jones - were minor \par
mysteries which Poole was not really interested in solving; it was sufficient \par
that he was a superb organizer and had handled the mechanics of Operation \par
Damocles with quiet efficiency.\par
\par
    'Well, Frank - it's on its way. Will be landing in one hour, ten minutes. I \par
assume that Halman can take it from there, but I don't understand how he can \par
actually handle - is that the right word? - these tablets.'\par
\par
    'I wondered about that, until someone on the Europa Committee explained it. \par
There's a well-known - though not to me! - theorem stating that any computer can \par
emulate any other computer. So I'm sure that Halman knows exactly what he's \par
doing. He would never have agreed otherwise.'\par
\par
    'I hope you're right,' replied the Colonel. 'If not - well, I don't know \par
what alternative we have.'\par
\par
    There was a gloomy pause, until Poole did his best to relieve the tension.\par
\par
    'By the way, have you heard the local rumour about our visit?'\par
\par
    'Which particular one?'\par
\par
    'That we're a special commission sent here to investigate crime and \par
corruption in this raw frontier township. The Mayor and the Sheriff are supposed \par
to be running scared.'\par
\par
    'How I envy them,' said 'Colonel Jones'. 'Sometimes it's quite a relief to \par
have something trivial to worry about.'\par
\par
    \par
\par
39\par
Deicide\par
\par
    \par
\par
    Like all the inhabitants of Anubis City (population now 56,521), Dr Theodore \par
Khan woke soon after local midnight to the sound of the General Alarm. His first \par
reaction was 'Not another Icequake, for Deus's sake!'\par
\par
    He rushed to the window, shouting 'Open' so loudly that the room did not \par
understand, and he had to repeat the order in a normal voice. The light of \par
Lucifer should have come streaming in, painting the patterns on the floor that \par
so fascinated visitors from Earth, because they never moved even a fraction of a \par
millimetre, no matter how long they waited...\par
\par
    That unvarying beam of light was no longer there. As Khan stared in utter \par
disbelief through the huge, transparent bubble of the Anubis Dome, he saw a sky \par
that Ganymede had not known for a thousand years. It was once more ablaze with \par
stars; Lucifer had gone.\par
\par
    And then, as he explored the forgotten constellations, Kahn noticed \par
something even more terrifying. Where Lucifer should have been was a tiny disc \par
of absolute blackness, eclipsing the unfamiliar stars.\par
\par
    There was only one possible explanation, Khan told himself numbly. Lucifer \par
has been swallowed by a Black Hole. And it may be our turn next.\par
\par
    On the balcony of the Grannymede Hotel, Poole was watching the same \par
spectacle, but with more complex emotions. Even before the general alarm, his \par
comsec had woken him with a message from Halman.\par
\par
    'It is beginning. We have infected the Monolith. But one - perhaps several - \par
of the viruses have entered our own circuits. We do not know if we will be able \par
to use the memory tablet you have given us. If we succeed, we will meet you in \par
Tsienville.'\par
\par
    Then came the surprising and strangely moving words whose exact emotional \par
content would be debated for generations:\par
\par
    'If we are unable to download, remember us.' From the room behind him, Poole \par
heard the voice of the Mayor, doing his best to reassure the now sleepless \par
citizens of Anubis. Though he opened with that most terrifying of official \par
statements - 'No cause for alarm' - the Mayor did indeed have words of comfort.\par
\par
    'We don't know what's happening but Lucifer's still shining normally! I \par
repeat - Lucifer is still shining! We've just received news from the interorbit \par
shuttle Alcyone, which left for Callisto half an hour ago. Here's their view -, \par
Poole left the balcony and rushed into his room just in time to see Lucifer \par
blaze reassuringly on the vidscreen.\par
\par
    'What's happened,' the Mayor continued breathlessly, 'is that something has \par
caused a temporary eclipse - we'll zoom in to look at it... Callisto \par
Observatory, come in please...'\par
\par
    How does he know it's 'temporary'? thought Poole, as he waited for the next \par
image to come up on the screen.\par
\par
    Lucifer vanished, to be replaced by a field of stars. At the same time, the \par
Mayor faded out and another voice took over:\par
\par
    '- two-metre telescope, but almost any instrument will do. It's a disc of \par
perfectly black material, just over ten thousand kilometres across, so thin it \par
shows no visible thickness. And it's placed exactly - obviously deliberately -to \par
block Ganymede from receiving any light.\par
\par
    'We'll zoom in to see if it shows any details, though I rather doubt it...'\par
\par
    From the viewpoint of Callisto, the occulting disc was foreshortened into an \par
oval, twice as long as it was wide. It expanded until it completely filled the \par
screen; thereafter, it was impossible to tell whether the image was being \par
zoomed, as it showed no structure whatsoever.\par
\par
    'As I thought - there's nothing to see. Let's pan over to the edge of the \par
thing...'\par
\par
    Again there was no sense of motion, until a field of stars suddenly \par
appeared, sharply defined by the curving edge of the world-sized disc. It was \par
exactly as if they were looking past the horizon of an airless, perfectly smooth \par
planet.\par
\par
    No, it was not perfectly smooth...\par
\par
    'That's interesting,' commented the astronomer, who until now had sounded \par
remarkably matter-of-fact, as if this sort of thing was an everyday occurrence. \par
'The edge looks jagged - but in a very regular fashion - like a saw-blade...'\par
\par
    A circular saw Poole muttered under his breath. Is it going to carve us up? \par
Don't be ridiculous...\par
\par
    'This is as close as we can get before diffraction spoils the image - we'll \par
process it later and get much better detail:'\par
\par
    The magnification was now so great that all trace of the disc's circularity \par
had vanished. Across the vidscreen was a black band, serrated along its edge \par
with triangles so identical that Poole found it hard to avoid the ominous \par
analogy of a saw-blade. Yet something else was nagging at the back of his \par
mind...\par
\par
    Like everyone else on Ganymede, he watched the infinitely more distant stars \par
drifting in and out of those geometrically perfect valleys. Very probably, many \par
others jumped to the same conclusion even before he did.\par
\par
    If you attempt to make a disc out of rectangular blocks -whether their \par
proportions are 1:4:9 or any other - it cannot possibly have a smooth edge. Of \par
course, you can make it as near a perfect circle as you like, by using smaller \par
and smaller blocks. Yet why go to that trouble, if you merely wanted to build a \par
screen large enough to eclipse a sun?\par
\par
    The Mayor was right; the eclipse was indeed temporary. But its ending was \par
the precise opposite of a solar one.\par
\par
    First light broke through at the exact centre, not in the usual necklace of \par
Bailey's Beads along the very edge. Jagged lines radiated from a dazzling \par
pinhole - and now, under the highest magnification, the structure of the disc \par
was being revealed. It was composed of millions of identical rectangles, perhaps \par
the same size as the Great Wall of Europa. And now they were splitting apart: it \par
was as if a gigantic jigsaw puzzle was being dismantled.\par
\par
    Its perpetual, but now briefly interrupted, daylight was slowly returning to \par
Ganymede, as the disc fragmented and the rays of Lucifer poured through the \par
widening gaps. Now the components themselves were evaporating, almost as if they \par
needed the reinforcement of each other's contact to maintain reality.\par
\par
    Although it seemed like hours to the anxious watchers in Anubis City, the \par
whole event lasted for less than fifteen minutes. Not until it was all over did \par
anyone pay attention to Europa itself.\par
\par
    The Great Wall was gone: and it was almost an hour before the news came from \par
Earth, Mars and Moon that the Sun itself had appeared to flicker for a few \par
seconds, before resuming business as usual.\par
\par
    It had been a highly selective set of eclipses, obviously targeted at \par
humankind. Nowhere else in the Solar System would anything have been noticed.\par
\par
    In the general excitement, it was a little longer before the world realized \par
that TMA ZERO and TMA ONE had both vanished, leaving only their four-million-\par
year-old imprints on Tycho and Africa.\par
\par
    \par
\par
    It was the first time the Europs could ever have met humans, but they seemed \par
neither alarmed nor surprised by the huge creatures moving among them at such \par
lightning speed. Of course, it was not too easy to interpret the emotional state \par
of something that looked like a small, leafless bush, with no obvious sense \par
organs or means of communication. But if they were frightened by the arrival of \par
Alcyone, and the emergence of its passengers, they would surely have remained \par
hiding in their igloos.\par
\par
    As Frank Poole, slightly encumbered by his protective suit and the gift of \par
shining copper wire he was carrying, walked into the untidy suburbs of \par
Tsienville, he wondered what the Europs thought of recent events. For them, \par
there had been no eclipse of Lucifer, but the disappearance of the Great Wall \par
must surely have been a shock. It had stood there for a thousand years, as a \par
shield and doubtless much more; then, abruptly, it was gone, as if it had never \par
been...\par
\par
    The petabyte tablet was waiting for him, with a group of Europs standing \par
around it, demonstrating the first sign of curiosity that Poole had ever \par
observed in them. He wondered if Halman had somehow told them to watch over this \par
gift from space, until he came to collect it.\par
\par
    And to take it back, since it now contained not only a sleeping friend but \par
terrors which some future age might exorcise, to the only place where it could \par
be safely stored.\par
\par
    \par
\par
40\par
Midnight: Pico\par
\par
    \par
\par
    It would be hard, Poole thought, to imagine a more peaceful scene - \par
especially after the trauma of the last weeks. The slanting rays of a nearly \par
full Earth revealed all the subtle details of the waterless Sea of Rains - not \par
obliterating them, as the incandescent fury of the Sun would do.\par
\par
    The small convoy of mooncars was arranged in a semicircle a hundred metres \par
from the inconspicuous opening at the base of Pico that was the entrance to the \par
Vault. From this viewpoint, Poole could see that the mountain did not live up to \par
the name that the early astronomers, misled by its pointed shadow, had given to \par
it. It was more like a rounded hill than a sharp peak, and he could well believe \par
that one of the local pastimes was bicycle-riding to the summit. Until now, none \par
of those sportsmen and women could have guessed at the secret hidden beneath \par
their wheels: he hoped that the sinister knowledge would not discourage their \par
healthy exercise.\par
\par
    An hour ago, with a sense of mingled sadness and triumph, he had handed over \par
the tablet he had brought -never letting it out of his sight - from Ganymede \par
directly to the Moon.\par
\par
    'Good-bye, old friends,' he had murmured. 'You've done well. Perhaps some \par
future generation will reawaken you. But on the whole - I rather hope not.'\par
\par
    He could imagine, all too clearly, one desperate reason why Halman's \par
knowledge might be needed again. By now, surely, some message was on its way to \par
that unknown control centre, bearing the news that its servant on Europa no \par
longer existed. With reasonable luck, it would take 950 years, give or take a \par
few, before any response could be expected.\par
\par
    Poole had often cursed Einstein in the past; now he blessed him. Even the \par
powers behind the Monoliths, it now appeared certain, could not spread their \par
influence faster than the speed of light. So the human race should have almost a \par
millennium to prepare for the next encounter - if there was to be one. Perhaps \par
by that time, it would be better prepared.\par
\par
    Something was emerging from the tunnel - the track-mounted, semi-humanoid \par
robot that had carried the tablet into the Vault. It was almost comic to see a \par
machine enclosed in the kind of isolation suit used as protection against deadly \par
germs and here on the airless Moon! But no one was taking any chances, however \par
unlikely they might seem. After all, the robot had moved among those carefully \par
sequestered nightmares, and although according to its video cameras everything \par
appeared in order, there was always a chance that some vial had leaked, or some \par
canister's seal had broken. The Moon was a very stable environment, but during \par
the centuries it had known many quakes and meteor impacts.\par
\par
    The robot came to a halt fifty metres outside the tunnel. Slowly, the \par
massive plug that sealed the Vault swung back into place, and began to rotate in \par
its threads, like a giant bolt being screwed into the mountain.\par
\par
    'All not wearing dark glasses, please close your eyes or look away from the \par
robot!' said an urgent voice over the mooncar radio. Poole twisted round in his \par
seat, just in time to see an explosion of light on the roof of the vehicle. When \par
he turned back to look at Pico, all that was left of the robot was a heap of \par
glowing slag; even to someone who had spent much of his life surrounded by \par
vacuum, it seemed altogether wrong that tendrils of smoke were not slowly \par
spiralling up from it.\par
\par
    'Sterilization completed,' said the voice of the Mission Controller. 'Thank \par
you, everybody. Now returning to Plato City.'\par
\par
    How ironic - that the human race had been saved by the skilful deployment of \par
its own insanities! What moral, Poole wondered, could one possibly draw from \par
that?\par
\par
    He looked back at the beautiful blue Earth, huddling beneath its tattered \par
blanket of clouds for protection against the cold of space. Up there, a few \par
weeks from now, he hoped to cradle his first grandson in his arms.\par
\par
    Whatever godlike powers and principalities lurked beyond the stars, Poole \par
reminded himself, for ordinary humans only two things were important - Love and \par
Death.\par
\par
    His body had not yet aged a hundred years: he still had plenty of time for \par
both.\par
\par
    \par
\par
\i EPILOGUE\par
\par
    'Their little universe is very young, and its god is still a child. But it \par
is too soon to judge them; when We return in the Last Days, We will consider \par
what should be saved.'\i0\par
