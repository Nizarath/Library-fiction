    THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN\par
\par
    1\par
    The Frozen Years\par
\par
    'For a man of seventy, you're in extremely good shape,' remarked Dr \par
Glazunov, looking up from the Medcom's final print-out. 'I'd have put you down \par
as not more than sixty-five.'\par
\par
    'Happy to hear it, Oleg. Especially as I'm a hundred and three - as you know \par
perfectly well.'\par
\par
    'Here we go again! Anyone would think you've never read Professor Rudenko's \par
book.'\par
\par
    'Dear old Katerina! We'd planned a get-together on her hundredth birthday. I \par
was so sorry she never made it - that's what comes of spending too much time on \par
Earth.'\par
\par
    'Ironic, since she was the one who coined that famous slogan "Gravity is the \par
bringer of old age."'\par
\par
    Dr Heywood Floyd stared thoughtfully at the ever-changing panorama of the \par
beautiful planet, only six thousand kilometres away, on which he could never \par
walk again. It was even more ironic that, through the most stupid accident of \par
his life, he was still in excellent health when virtually all his old friends \par
were dead.\par
\par
    He had been back on Earth only a week when, despite all the warnings and his \par
own determination that nothing of the sort would ever happen to him, he had \par
stepped off that second-storey balcony. (Yes, he had been celebrating: but he \par
had earned it - he was a hero on the new world to which Leonov had returned.) \par
The multiple fractures had led to complications, which could best be handled in \par
the Pasteur Space Hospital.\par
\par
    That had been in 2015. And now - he could not really believe it, but there \par
was the calendar on the wall - it was 2061.\par
\par
    For Heywood Floyd, the biological clock had not merely been slowed down by \par
the one-sixth Earth gravity of the hospital; twice in his life it had actually \par
been reversed. It was now generally believed - though some authorities disputed \par
it - that hibernation did more than merely stop the ageing process; it \par
encouraged rejuvenation. Floyd had actually become younger on his voyage to \par
Jupiter and back.\par
\par
    'So you really think it's safe for me to go?'\par
\par
    'Nothing in this Universe is safe, Heywood. All I can say is that there are \par
no physiological objections. After all, your environment will be virtually the \par
same aboard Universe as it is here. She may not have quite the standard of - ah \par
- superlative medical expertise we can provide at Pasteur, but Dr Mahindran is a \par
good man. If there's any problem he can't cope with, he can put you into \par
hibernation again, and ship you back to us, COD.'\par
\par
    It was the verdict that Floyd had hoped for, yet somehow his pleasure was \par
alloyed with sadness. He would be away for weeks from his home of almost half a \par
century, and the new friends of his later years. And although Universe was a \par
luxury liner compared with the primitive Leonov (now hovering high above Farside \par
as one of the main exhibits at the Lagrange Museum) there was still some element \par
of risk in any extended space voyage. Especially like the pioneering one on \par
which he was now preparing to embark.\par
\par
\par
\par
    Yet that, perhaps, was exactly what he was seeking - even at a hundred and \par
three (or, according to the complex geriatric accounting of the late Professor \par
Katerina Rudenko, a hale and hearty sixty-five.) During the last decade, he had \par
become aware of an increasing restlessness and a vague dissatisfaction with a \par
life that was too comfortable and well-ordered.\par
\par
    Despite all the exciting projects now in progress around the Solar System - \par
the Mars Renewal, the establishment of the Mercury Base, the Greening of \par
Ganymede - there had been no goal on which he could really focus his interests \par
and his still considerable energies. Two centuries ago, one of the first poets \par
of the Scientific Era had summed up his feelings perfectly, speaking through the \par
lips of Odysseus/Ulysses:\par
\par
\par
\par
    Life piled on life\par
\par
    Were all too little, and of one of me\par
\par
    Little remains; but every hour is saved\par
\par
    From that eternal silence, something more,\par
\par
    A bringer of new things: and vile it were\par
\par
    For some three suns to store and hoard myself,\par
\par
    And this grey spirit yearning in desire\par
\par
    To follow knowledge like a sinking star,\par
\par
    Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.\par
\par
\par
\par
    'Three suns', indeed! It was more than forty:\par
\par
    Ulysses would have been ashamed of him. But the next verse - which he knew \par
so well - was even more appropriate:\par
\par
\par
\par
    It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:\par
\par
    It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,\par
\par
    And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.\par
\par
    Though much is taken, much abides; and though\par
\par
    We are not now that strength which in old days\par
\par
    Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;\par
\par
    One equal temper of heroic hearts,\par
\par
    Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will\par
\par
    To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\par
\par
\par
\par
    'To seek, to find...' Well, now he knew what he was going to seek, and to \par
find - because he knew exactly where it would be. Short of some catastrophic \par
accident, there was no way in which it could possibly elude him.\par
\par
    It was not a goal he had ever consciously had in mind, and even now he was \par
not quite sure why it had become so suddenly dominant. He would have thought \par
himself immune to the fever which was once again infecting mankind - for the \par
second time in his life! - but perhaps he was mistaken. Or it could have been \par
that the unexpected invitation to join the short list of distinguished guests \par
aboard Universe had fired his imagination, and awakened an enthusiasm he had not \par
even known he possessed.\par
\par
    There was another possibility. After all these years, he could still \par
remember what an anticlimax the 1985/6 encounter had been to the general public. \par
Now was a chance - the last for him, and the first for humanity - to more than \par
make up for any previous disappointment.\par
\par
    Back in the twentieth century, only flybys had been possible. This time, \par
there would be an actual landing, as pioneering in its way as Armstrong's and \par
Aldrin's first steps on the Moon.\par
\par
    Dr Heywood Floyd, veteran of the 2010-15 mission to Jupiter, let his \par
imagination fly outwards to the ghostly visitor once again returning from the \par
deeps of space, gaining speed second by second as it prepared to round the Sun. \par
And between the orbits of Earth and Venus the most famous of all comets would \par
meet the still uncompleted space-liner Universe, on her maiden flight.\par
\par
    The exact point of rendezvous was not yet settled, but his decision was \par
already made.\par
\par
    'Halley - here I come...' whispered Heywood Floyd.\par
\par
\par
\par
    2\par
    First Sight\par
\par
\par
\par
    It is not true that one must leave Earth to appreciate the full splendour of \par
the heavens. Not even in space is the starry sky more glorious than when viewed \par
from a high mountain, on a perfectly clear night, far from any source of \par
artificial illumination. Even though the stars appear brighter beyond the \par
atmosphere, the eye cannot really appreciate the difference; and the \par
overwhelming spectacle of half the celestial sphere at a single glance is \par
something that no observation window can provide.\par
\par
    But Heywood Floyd was more than content with his private view of the \par
Universe, especially during the times when the residential zone was on the \par
shadow side of the slowly revolving space hospital. Then there would be nothing \par
in his rectangular field of view but stars, planets, nebulae - and occasionally, \par
drowning out all else, the unblinking glare of Lucifer, new rival to the Sun.\par
\par
    About ten minutes before the beginning of his artificial night, he would \par
switch off all the cabin lights - even the red emergency standby - so that he \par
could become completely dark-adapted. A little late in life for a space \par
engineer, he had learned the pleasures of naked-eye astronomy, and could now \par
identify virtually any constellation, even if he could glimpse only a small \par
portion of it.\par
\par
    Almost every 'night' that May, as the comet was passing inside the orbit of \par
Mars, he had checked its location on the star charts. Although it was an easy \par
object with a good pair of binoculars, Floyd had stubbornly resisted their aid; \par
he was playing a little game, seeing how well his ageing eyes would respond to \par
the challenge. Though two astronomers on Mauna Kea already claimed to have \par
observed the comet visually, no-one believed them, and similar assertions from \par
other residents of Pasteur had been treated with even greater scepticism.\par
\par
    But tonight, a magnitude of at least six was predicted; he might be in luck. \par
He traced the line from Gamma to Epsilon, and stared towards the apex of an \par
imaginary equilateral triangle set upon it - almost as if he could focus his \par
vision across the Solar System by a sheer effort of will.\par
\par
    And there it was! - just as he had first seen it, seventy-six years ago, \par
inconspicuous but unmistakable. If he had not known exactly where to look, he \par
would not even have noticed it, or would have dismissed it as some distant \par
nebula.\par
\par
    To his naked eye it was merely a tiny, perfectly circular blob of mist; \par
strain as he would, he was unable to detect any trace of a tail. But the small \par
flotilla of probes that had been escorting the comet for months had already \par
recorded the first outbursts of dust and gas that would soon create a glowing \par
plume across the stars, pointing directly away from its creator, the Sun,\par
\par
    Like everyone else, Heywood Floyd had watched the transformation of the \par
cold, dark - no, almost black - nucleus as it entered the inner Solar System. \par
After seventy years of deepfreeze, the complex mixture of water, ammonia and \par
other ices was beginning to thaw and bubble. A flying mountain, roughly the \par
shape - and size - of the island of Manhattan was turning on a cosmic spit every \par
fifty-three hours; as the heat of the Sun seeped through the insulating crust, \par
the vaporizing gases were making Halley's Comet behave like a leaking steam-\par
boiler. Jets of water vapour, mixed with dust and a witch's brew of organic \par
chemicals, were bursting out from half a dozen small craters; the largest - \par
about the size of a football field - erupted regularly about two hours after \par
local dawn. It looked exactly like a terrestrial geyser, and had been promptly \par
christened 'Old Faithful'.\par
\par
    Already, he had fantasies of standing on the rim of that crater, waiting for \par
the Sun to rise above the dark, contorted landscape which he already knew well \par
through the images from space. True, the contract said nothing about passengers \par
- as opposed to crew and scientific personnel - going outside the ship when it \par
landed on Halley.\par
\par
    On the other hand, there was also nothing in the small print that \par
specifically forbade it.\par
\par
    They'll have a job to stop me, thought Heywood Floyd. I'm sure I can still \par
handle a spacesuit. And if I'm wrong...\par
\par
    He remembered reading that a visitor to the Taj Mahal had once remarked: \par
'I'd die tomorrow for a monument like this.'\par
\par
    He would gladly settle for Halley's Comet.\par
\par
\par
    3\par
    Re-entry\par
\par
\par
\par
    Even apart from that embarrassing accident, the return to Earth had not been \par
easy.\par
\par
    The first shock had come soon after revival, when Dr Rudenko had woken him \par
from his long sleep. Walter Curnow was hovering beside her, and even in his \par
semi-conscious state he could tell that something was wrong; their pleasure at \par
seeing him awake was a little too exaggerated, and failed to conceal a sense of \par
strain. Not until he was fully recovered did they let him know that Dr Chandra \par
was no longer with them.\par
\par
    Somewhere beyond Mars, so imperceptibly that the monitors could not pinpoint \par
the time, he had simply ceased to live. His body, set adrift in space, had \par
continued unchecked along Leonov's orbit, and had long since been consumed by \par
the fires of the Sun.\par
\par
    The cause of death was totally unknown, but Max Brailovsky expressed a view \par
that, highly unscientific though it was, not even Surgeon-Commander Katerina \par
Rudenko attempted to refute.\par
\par
    'He couldn't live without Hal.'\par
\par
    Walter Curnow, of all people, added another thought.\par
\par
    'I wonder how Hal will take it?' he asked. 'Something out there must be \par
monitoring all our broadcasts. Sooner or later, he'll know.'\par
\par
\par
\par
    And now Curnow was gone too - so were they all except little Zenia. He had \par
not seen her for twenty years, but her card arrived punctually every Christmas. \par
The last one was still pinned above his desk; it showed a troika laden with \par
gifts speeding through the snows of a Russian winter, watched by extremely \par
hungry-looking wolves.\par
\par
    Forty-five years! Sometimes it seemed only yesterday that Leonov had \par
returned to Earth orbit, and the applause of all mankind. Yet it had been a \par
curiously subdued applause, respectful but lacking genuine enthusiasm. The \par
mission to Jupiter had been altogether too much of a success; it had opened a \par
Pandora's box, the full contents of which had yet to be disclosed.\par
\par
    When the black monolith known as Tycho Magnetic Anomaly One had been \par
excavated on the Moon, only a handful of men knew of its existence. Not until \par
after Discovery's ill-fated voyage to Jupiter did the world learn that, four \par
million years ago, another intelligence had passed through the Solar System, and \par
left its calling card. The news was a revelation - but not a surprise; something \par
of the sort had been expected for decades.\par
\par
    And it had all happened long before the human race existed. Although some \par
mysterious accident had befallen Discovery out round Jupiter, there was no real \par
evidence that it involved anything more than a shipboard malfunction. Although \par
the philosophical consequences of TMA 1 were profound, for all practical \par
purposes mankind was still alone in the Universe.\par
\par
    Now that was no longer true. Only light minutes away - a mere stone's throw \par
in the Cosmos - was an intelligence that could create a star, and, for its own \par
inscrutable purpose, destroy a planet a thousand times the size of Earth. Even \par
more ominous was the fact that it had shown awareness of mankind, through the \par
last message that Discovery had beamed back from the moons of Jupiter just \par
before the fiery birth of Lucifer had destroyed it:\par
\par
\par
\par
    ALL THESE WORLDS ARE YOURS - EXCEPT EUROPA.\par
    ATTEMPT NO LANDINGS THERE.\par
\par
\par
\par
    The brilliant new star, which had banished night except for the few months \par
in each year when it was passing behind the Sun, had brought both hope and fear \par
to mankind. Fear - because the Unknown, especially when it appeared linked with \par
omnipotence - could not fail to rouse such primeval emotions. Hope - because of \par
the transformation it had wrought in global politics.\par
\par
    It had often been said that the only thing that could unite mankind was a \par
threat from space. Whether Lucifer was a threat, no-one knew; but it was \par
certainly a challenge. And that, as it turned out, was enough.\par
\par
    Heywood Floyd had watched the geopolitical changes from his vantage point on \par
Pasteur, almost as if he was an alien observer himself. At first, he had no \par
intention of remaining in space, once his recovery was complete. To the baffled \par
annoyance of his doctors, that took an altogether unreasonable length of time.\par
\par
    Looking back from the tranquillity of later years, Floyd knew exactly why \par
his bones refused to mend.\par
\par
    He simply did not wish to return to Earth: there was nothing for him, down \par
on the dazzling blue and white globe that filled his sky. There were times when \par
he could well understand how Chandra might have lost the will to live.\par
\par
    It was pure chance that he had not been with his first wife on that flight \par
to Europe. Now Marion was part of another life, that might have belonged to \par
someone else, and their two daughters were amiable strangers with families of \par
their own.\par
\par
    But he had lost Caroline through his own actions, even though he had no real \par
choice in the matter. She had never understood (had he really done so himself?) \par
why he had left the beautiful home they had made together, to exile himself for \par
years in the cold wastes far from the Sun.\par
\par
    Though he had known, even before the mission was half over, that Caroline \par
would not wait, he had hoped desperately that Chris would forgive him. But even \par
this consolation had been denied; his son had been without a father for too \par
long. By the time that Floyd returned, he had found another, in the man who had \par
taken his place in Caroline's life. The estrangement was complete; he thought he \par
would never get over it, but of course he did - after a fashion.\par
\par
    His body had cunningly conspired with his unconscious desires. When at last \par
he returned to Earth, after his protracted convalescence in Pasteur, he promptly \par
developed such alarming symptoms - including something suspiciously like bone \par
necrosis - that he was immediately rushed back to orbit. And there he had \par
stayed, apart from a few excursions to the Moon, completely adapted to living in \par
the zero to one-sixth gravity regime of the slowly rotating space hospital.\par
\par
    He was not a recluse - far from it. Even while he was convalescing, he was \par
dictating reports, giving evidence to endless commissions, being interviewed by \par
media representatives. He was a famous man, and enjoyed the experience - while \par
it lasted. It helped to compensate for his inner wounds.\par
\par
    The first complete decade - 2020 to 2030 - seemed to have passed so swiftly \par
that he now found it difficult to focus upon it. There were the usual crises, \par
scandals, crimes, catastrophes - notably the Great Californian Earthquake, whose \par
aftermath he had watched with fascinated horror through the station's monitor \par
screens. Under their greatest magnification, in favourable conditions, they \par
could show individual human beings; but from his God's-eye-view it had been \par
impossible to identify with the scurrying dots fleeing from the burning cities. \par
Only the ground cameras revealed the true horror.\par
\par
    During that decade, though the results would not be apparent until later, \par
the political tectonic plates were moving as inexorably as the geological ones - \par
yet in the opposite sense, as if time was running backwards. For in the \par
beginning, the Earth had possessed the single supercontinent of Pangaea, which \par
over the aeons had split asunder. So had the human species, into innumerable \par
tribes and nations; now it was merging together, as the old linguistic and \par
cultural divisions began to blur.\par
\par
    Although Lucifer had accelerated the process, it had begun decades earlier, \par
when the coming of the jet age had triggered an explosion of global tourism. At \par
almost the same time - it was not, of course, a coincidence - satellites and \par
fibre optics had revolutionized communications. With the historic abolition of \par
long-distance charges on 31 December 2000, every telephone call became a local \par
one, and the human race greeted the new millennium by transforming itself into \par
one huge, gossiping family.\par
\par
    Like most families, it was not always a peaceful one, but its disputes no \par
longer threatened the entire planet. The second - and last - nuclear war saw the \par
use in combat of no more bombs than the first: precisely two. And though the \par
kilotonnage was greater, the casualties were far fewer, as both were used \par
against sparsely populated oil installations. At that point the Big Three of \par
China, the US and the USSR moved with commendable speed and wisdom, sealing off \par
the battle zone until the surviving combatants had come to their senses.\par
\par
    By the decade of 2020-30, a major war between the Great Powers was as \par
unthinkable as one between Canada and the United States had been in the century \par
before. This was not due to any vast improvement in human nature, or indeed to \par
any single factor except the normal preference of life over death. Much of the \par
machinery of peace was not even consciously planned: before the politicians \par
realized what had happened, they discovered that it was in place, and \par
functioning well...\par
\par
    No statesman, no idealist of any persuasion invented the 'Peace Hostage' \par
movement; the very name was not coined until well after someone had noticed that \par
at any given moment there were a hundred thousand Russian tourists in the United \par
States - and half a million Americans in the Soviet Union, most of them engaged \par
in their traditional pastime of complaining about the plumbing. And perhaps even \par
more to the point, both groups contained a disproportionately large number of \par
highly non-expendable individuals - the sons and daughters of wealth, privilege \par
and political power.\par
\par
    And even if one wished, it was no longer possible to plan a large-scale war. \par
The Age of Transparency had dawned in the 1990s, when enterprising news media \par
had started to launch photographic satellites with resolutions comparable to \par
those that the military had possessed for three decades. The Pentagon and the \par
Kremlin were furious; but they were no match for Reuters, Associated Press and \par
the unsleeping, twenty-four-hours-a-day cameras of the Orbital News Service.\par
\par
    By 2060, even though the world had not been completely disarmed, it had been \par
effectively pacified, and the fifty remaining nuclear weapons were all under \par
international control. There was surprisingly little opposition when that \par
popular monarch, Edward VIII, was elected the first Planetary President, only a \par
dozen states dissenting. They ranged in size and importance from the still \par
stubbornly neutral Swiss (whose restaurants and hotels nevertheless greeted the \par
new bureaucracy with open arms) to the even more fanatically independent \par
Malvinians, who now resisted all attempts by the exasperated British and \par
Argentines to foist them off on each other.\par
\par
    The dismantling of the vast and wholly parasitic armaments industry had \par
given an unprecedented - sometimes, indeed, unhealthy - boost to the world \par
economy. No longer were vital raw materials and brilliant engineering talents \par
swallowed up in a virtual black hole - or, even worse, turned to destruction. \par
Instead, they could be used to repair the ravages and neglect of centuries, by \par
rebuilding the world.\par
\par
    And building new ones. Now indeed mankind had found the 'moral equivalent of \par
war', and a challenge that could absorb the surplus energies of the race - for \par
as many millennia ahead as anyone dared to dream.\par
\par
\par
\par
    4\par
    Tycoon\par
\par
\par
\par
    When he was born, William Tsung had been called 'the most expensive baby in \par
the world'; he held the title for only two years before it was claimed by his \par
sister. She still held it, and now that the Family Laws had been repealed, it \par
would never be challenged.\par
\par
    Their father, the legendary Sir Lawrence, had been born when China had re-\par
instituted the stringent 'One Child, One Family' rule; his generation had \par
provided psychologists and social scientists with material for endless studies. \par
Having no brothers or sisters - and in many cases, no uncles or aunts - it was \par
unique in human history. Whether credit was due to the resilience of the species \par
or the merit of the Chinese 'extended family' system would probably never be \par
settled. The fact remained that the children of that strange time were \par
remarkably free from scars; but they were certainly not unaffected, and Sir \par
Lawrence had done his somewhat spectacular best to make up for the isolation of \par
his infancy.\par
\par
    When his second child was born in '22, the licensing system had become law. \par
You could have as many children as you wished, provided only that you paid the \par
appropriate fee. (The surviving old guard communists were not the only ones who \par
thought the whole scheme perfectly appalling, but they were outvoted by their \par
pragmatic colleagues in the fledgling congress of the People's Democratic \par
Republic.)\par
\par
    Numbers one and two were free. Number three cost a million sols. Number four \par
was two million. Number five was four million, and so on. The fact that, in \par
theory, there were no capitalists in the People's Republic was cheerfully \par
ignored.\par
\par
    Young Mr Tsung (that was years, of course, before King Edward gave him his \par
KBE) never revealed if he had any target in mind; he was still a fairly poor \par
millionaire when his fifth child was born. But he was still only forty, and when \par
the purchase of Hong Kong did not take quite as much of his capital as he had \par
feared, he discovered that he had a considerable amount of small change in hand.\par
\par
    So ran the legend - but, like many other stories about Sir Lawrence, it was \par
hard to distinguish fact from mythology. There was certainly no truth in the \par
persistent rumour that he had made his first fortune through the famous shoe-\par
box-sized pirate edition of the Library of Congress. The whole Molecular Memory \par
Module racket was an off-Earth operation, made possible by the United States' \par
failure to sign the Lunar Treaty.\par
\par
    Even though Sir Lawrence was not a multitrillionaire, the complex of \par
corporations he had built up made him the greatest financial power on earth - no \par
small achievement for the son of a humble videocassette peddler in what was \par
still known as the New Territories. He probably never noticed the eight million \par
for Child Number Six, or even the thirty-two for Number Eight. The sixty-four he \par
had to advance on Number Nine attracted world publicity, and after Number Ten \par
the bets placed on his future plans may well have exceeded the two hundred and \par
fifty-six million the next child would have cost him. However, at that point the \par
Lady Jasmine, who combined the best properties of steel and silk in exquisite \par
proportion, decided that the Tsung dynasty was adequately established.\par
\par
    It was quite by chance (if there is such a thing) that Sir Lawrence became \par
personally involved in the space business. He had, of course, extensive maritime \par
and aeronautical interests, but these were handled by his five sons and their \par
associates. Sir Lawrence's real love was communications - newspapers (those few \par
that were left), books, magazines (paper and electronic) and, above all, the \par
global television networks.\par
\par
    Then he had bought the magnificent old Peninsular Hotel, which to a poor \par
Chinese boy had once seemed the very symbol of wealth and power, and turned it \par
into his residence and main office. He surrounded it by a beautiful park, by the \par
simple expedient of pushing the huge shopping centres underground (his newly \par
formed Laser Excavation Corporation made a fortune in the process, and set a \par
precedent for many other cities).\par
\par
    One day, as he was admiring the unparalleled skyline of the city across the \par
harbour, he decided that a further improvement was necessary. The view from the \par
lower floors of the Peninsular had been blocked for decades by a large building \par
looking like a squashed golfball. This, Sir Lawrence decided, would have to go.\par
\par
    The Director of the Hong Kong Planetarium - widely considered to be among \par
the five best in the world - had other ideas, and very soon Sir Lawrence was \par
delighted to discover someone he could not buy at any price. The two men became \par
firm friends; but when Dr Hessenstein arranged a special presentation for Sir \par
Lawrence's sixtieth birthday, he did not know that he would help to change the \par
history of the Solar System.\par
\par
\par
\par
    5\par
    Out of the Ice\par
\par
\par
\par
    More than a hundred years after Zeiss had built the first prototype in Jena \par
in 1924, there were still a few optical planetarium projectors in use, looming \par
dramatically over their audiences. But Hong Kong had retired its third-\par
generation instrument decades ago, in favour of the far more versatile \par
electronic system. The whole of the great dome was, essentially, a giant \par
television screen, made up of thousands of separate panels, on which any \par
conceivable image could be displayed.\par
\par
    The programme had opened - inevitably - with a tribute to the unknown \par
inventor of the rocket, somewhere in China during the thirteenth century. The \par
first five minutes were a high-speed historical survey, giving perhaps less than \par
due credit to the Russian, German and American pioneers in order to concentrate \par
on the career of Dr Hsue-Shen Tsien. His countrymen could be excused, in such a \par
time and place, if they made him appear as important in the history of rocket \par
development as Goddard, von Braun, or Koroylev. And they certainly had just \par
grounds for indignation at his arrest on trumped-up charges in the United States \par
when, after helping to establish the famed Jet Propulsion Laboratory and being \par
appointed Caltech's first Goddard Professor, he decided to return to his \par
homeland.\par
\par
    The launching of the first Chinese satellite by the 'Long March 1' rocket in \par
1970 was barely mentioned, perhaps because at that time the Americans were \par
already walking on the Moon. Indeed, the rest of the twentieth century was \par
dismissed in a few minutes, to take the story up to 2007 and the construction of \par
the spaceship Tsien.\par
\par
    The narrator did not gloat unduly over the consternation of the other \par
spacefaring powers, when a presumed Chinese space station suddenly blasted out \par
of orbit and headed for Jupiter, to overtake the Russian-American mission aboard \par
the Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov. The story was dramatic - and tragic - enough to \par
require no embellishment.\par
\par
    Unfortunately, there was very little authentic visual material to illustrate \par
it: the programme had to rely largely on special effects and intelligent \par
reconstruction from later, long-range photo-surveys. During their brief sojourn \par
on the icy surface of Europa, Tsien's crew had been far too busy to make \par
television documentaries, or even set up an unattended camera.\par
\par
    Nevertheless, the words spoken at the time conveyed much of the drama of \par
that first landing on the moons of Jupiter. The commentary broadcast from the \par
approaching Leonov by Heywood Floyd served admirably to set the scene, and there \par
were plenty of library shots of Europa to illustrate it:\par
\par
    'At this very moment I'm looking at it through the most powerful of the \par
ship's telescopes; under this magnification, it's ten times larger than the Moon \par
as you see it with the naked eye. And it's a really weird sight.\par
\par
    'The surface is a uniform pink, with a few small brown patches. It's covered \par
with an intricate network of narrow lines, curling and weaving in all \par
directions. In fact, it looks very much like a photo from a medical textbook, \par
showing a pattern of veins and arteries.\par
\par
    'A few of these features are hundreds - or even thousands - of kilometres \par
long, and look rather like the illusory canals that Percival Lowell and other \par
early-twentieth-century astronomers imagined they'd seen on Mars.\par
\par
    'But Europa's canals aren't an illusion, though of course they're not \par
artificial. What's more, they do contain water - or at least ice. For the \par
satellite is almost entirely covered by ocean, averaging fifty kilometres deep.\par
\par
    'Because it's so far from the Sun, Europa's surface temperature is extremely \par
low - about a hundred and fifty degrees below freezing. So one might expect its \par
single ocean to be a solid block of ice.\par
\par
    'Surprisingly, that isn't the case because there's a lot of heat generated \par
inside Europa by tidal forces - the same forces that drive the great volcanoes \par
on neighbouring Io.\par
\par
    'So the ice is continually melting, breaking up and freezing, forming cracks \par
and lanes like those in the floating ice sheets in our own polar regions. It's \par
that intricate tracery of cracks I'm seeing now; most of them are dark and very \par
ancient - perhaps millions of years old. But a few are almost pure white; \par
they're the new ones that have just opened up, and have a crust only a few \par
centimetres thick.\par
\par
    'Tsien has landed right beside one of these white streaks - the fifteen-\par
hundred-kilometre-long feature that's been christened the Grand Canal. \par
Presumably the Chinese intend to pump its water into their propellant tanks, so \par
that they can explore the Jovian satellite system and then return to Earth. That \par
may not be easy, but they'll certainly have studied the landing site with great \par
care, and must know what they're doing.\par
\par
    'It's obvious, now, why they've taken such a risk - and why they claim \par
Europa. As a refuelling point, it could be the key to the entire Solar \par
System...'\par
\par
    But it hadn't worked out that way, thought Sir Lawrence, as he reclined in \par
his luxurious chair beneath the streaked and mottled disc that filled his \par
artificial sky. The oceans of Europa were still inaccessible to mankind, for \par
reasons which were still a mystery. And not only inaccessible, but invisible: \par
since Jupiter had become a sun, both its inner satellites had vanished beneath \par
clouds of vapour boiling out from their interiors. He was looking at Europa as \par
it had been back in 2010 - not as it was today.\par
\par
    He had been little more than a boy then, but could still remember the pride \par
he felt in knowing that his countrymen - however much he disapproved of their \par
politics - were about to make the first landing on a virgin world.\par
\par
    There had been no camera there, of course, to record that landing, but the \par
reconstruction was superbly done. He could really believe that was the doomed \par
spaceship dropping silently out of the jetblack sky towards the Europan \par
icescape, and coming to rest beside the discoloured band of recently frozen \par
water that had been christened the Grand Canal.\par
\par
    Everyone knew what had happened next; perhaps wisely, there had been no \par
attempt to reproduce it visually. Instead, the image of Europa faded, to be \par
replaced by a portrait as familiar to every Chinese as Yuri Gagarin's was to \par
every Russian.\par
\par
    The first photograph showed Rupert Chang on his graduation day in 1989 - the \par
earnest young scholar, indistinguishable from a million others, utter1y unaware \par
of his appointment with history two decades in the future.\par
\par
    Briefly, to a background of subdued music, the commentator summed up the \par
highlights of Dr Chang's career, until his appointment as Science Officer aboard \par
Tsien. Cross-sections in time, the photographs grew older, until the last one, \par
taken immediately before the mission.\par
\par
    Sir Lawrence was glad of the planetarium's darkness; both his friends and \par
his enemies would have been surprised to see the moisture gathering in his eyes \par
as he listened to the message that Dr Chang had aimed towards the approaching \par
Leonov, never knowing if it would be received.\par
\par
    '... know you are aboard Leonov... may not have much time... aiming my suit \par
antenna where I think...'\par
\par
    The signal vanished for agonizing seconds, then came back much clearer, \par
though not appreciably louder.\par
\par
    '... relay this information to Earth. Tsien destroyed three hours ago. I'm \par
only survivor. Using my suit radio - no idea if it has enough range, but it's \par
the only chance. Please listen carefully. THERE IS LIFE ON EUROPA. I repeat: \par
THERE IS LIFE ON EUROPA...\par
\par
    The signal faded again.\par
\par
    '... soon after local midnight. We were pumping steadily and the tanks were \par
almost half full. Dr Lee and I went out to check the pipe insulation. Tsien \par
stands - stood - about thirty metres from the edge of the Grand Canal. Pipes go \par
directly from it and down through the ice. Very thin - not safe to walk on. The \par
warm upwelling...'\par
\par
    Again a long silence.\par
\par
    '... no problem - five kilowatts of lighting strung up on the ship. Like a \par
Christmas tree - beautiful, shining right through the ice. Glorious colours. Lee \par
saw it first - a huge dark mass rising up from the depths. At first we thought \par
it was a school of fish - too large for a single organism - then it started to \par
break through the ice.\par
\par
    '... like huge strands of wet seaweed, crawling along the ground. Lee ran \par
back to the ship to get a camera - I stayed to watch, reporting over the radio. \par
The thing moved so slowly I could easily outrun it. I was much more excited than \par
alarmed. Thought I knew what kind of creature it was - I've seen pictures of the \par
kelp forests off California - but I was quite wrong...\par
\par
    I could tell it was in trouble. It couldn't possibly survive at a \par
temperature a hundred and fifty below its normal environment. It was freezing \par
solid as it moved forward - bits were breaking off like glass - but it was still \par
advancing towards the ship - a black tidal wave, slowing down all the time.\par
\par
    'I was still so surprised that I couldn't think straight and I couldn't \par
imagine what it was trying to do.\par
\par
    '... climbing up the ship, building a kind of ice tunnel as it advanced. \par
Perhaps this was insulating it from the cold - the way termites protect \par
themselves from Sunlight with their little corridors of mud.\par
\par
    '... tons of ice on the ship. The radio antennas broke off first. Then I \par
could see the landing legs beginning to buckle - all in slow motion, like a \par
dream.\par
\par
    'Not until the ship started to topple did I realize what the thing was \par
trying to do - and then it was too late. We could have saved ourselves - if we'd \par
only switched off those lights.\par
\par
    'Perhaps it's a phototrope, its biological cycle triggered by the Sunlight \par
that filters through the ice. Or it could have been attracted like a moth to a \par
candle. Our floodlights must have been more brilliant than anything that Europa \par
has ever known.\par
\par
    'Then the ship crashed. I saw the hull split, a cloud of snowflakes form as \par
moisture condensed. All the lights went out, except for one, swinging back and \par
forth on a cable a couple of metres above the ground.\par
\par
    'I don't know what happened immediately after that. The next thing I \par
remember, I was standing under the light, beside the wreck of the ship, with a \par
fine powdering of fresh snow all around me. I could see my footsteps in it very \par
clearly... I must have run there; perhaps only a minute or two had elapsed...\par
\par
    'The plant - I still thought of it as a plant - was motionless. I wondered \par
if it had been damaged by the impact; large sections - as thick as a man's arm -\par
had splintered off, like broken twigs.\par
\par
    'Then the main trunk started to move again. It pulled away from the hull, \par
and began to crawl towards me. That was when I knew for certain that the thing \par
was light-sensitive: I was standing immediately under the thousand-watt lamp, \par
which had stopped swinging now.\par
\par
    'Imagine an oak tree - better still, a banyan with its multiple trunks and \par
roots - flattened out by gravity and trying to creep along the ground. It got to \par
within five metres of the light, then started to spread out until it had made a \par
perfect circle around me. Presumably that was the limit of its tolerance -the \par
point at which photo-attraction turned to repulsion. After that, nothing \par
happened for several minutes. I wondered if it was dead - frozen solid at last.\par
\par
    'Then I saw that large buds were forming on many of the branches. It was \par
like watching a time-lapse film of flowers opening. In fact I thought they were \par
flowers - each about as big as a man's head.\par
\par
    'Delicate, beautifully coloured membranes started to unfold. Even then, it \par
occurred to me that no-one - no thing - could ever have seen these colours \par
before; they had no existence until we brought our lights - our fatal lights - \par
to this world.\par
\par
    'Tendrils, stamens, waving feebly... I walked over to the living wall that \par
surrounded me, so that I would see exactly what was happening. Neither then, or \par
at any other time, had I felt the slightest fear of the creature. I was certain \par
that it was not malevolent - if indeed it was conscious at all.\par
\par
    'There were scores of the big flowers, in various stages of unfolding. Now, \par
they reminded me of butterflies, just emerging from the chrysalis... wings \par
crumpled, still feeble... I was getting closer and closer to the truth.\par
\par
    'But they were freezing - dying as quickly as they formed. Then, one after \par
another, they dropped off from the parent buds. For a few moments they flopped \par
around like fish stranded on dry land - and at last I realized exactly what they \par
were. Those membranes weren't petals - they were fins, or their equivalent. This \par
was the free-swimming, larval stage of the creature. Probably it spends much of \par
its life rooted on the seabed, then sends these mobile offspring in search of \par
new territory. Just like the corals of Earth's oceans.\par
\par
    'I knelt down to get a closer look at one of the little creatures. The \par
beautiful colours were fading now, to a drab brown. Some of the petal-fins had \par
snapped off, becoming brittle shards as they froze. But it was still moving \par
feebly, and as I approached it tried to avoid me. I wondered how it sensed my \par
presence.\par
\par
    'Then I noticed that the stamens - as I'd called them - all carried bright \par
blue dots at their tips. They looked like tiny star sapphires - or the blue eyes \par
along the mantle of a scallop - aware of light, but unable to form true images. \par
As I watched, the vivid blue faded, the sapphires became dull, ordinary \par
stones...\par
\par
    'Dr Floyd - or anyone else who is listening - I haven't much more time - \par
Jupiter will soon block my signal. But I've almost finished.\par
\par
    'I knew then what I had to do. The cable to that thousand-watt lamp was \par
hanging almost to the ground. I gave it a few tugs, and the light went out in a \par
shower of sparks.\par
\par
    'I wondered if it was too late. For a few minutes, nothing happened. So I \par
walked over to the wall of tangled branches around me, and kicked it.\par
\par
    'Slowly, the creature started to unweave itself, and to retreat back to the \par
Canal. There was plenty of light - I could see everything perfectly. Ganymede \par
and Callisto were in the sky - Jupiter was a huge, thin crescent - and there was \par
a big auroral display on the nightside, at the Jovian end of the Io flux tube. \par
There was no need to use my helmet light.\par
\par
    'I followed the creature all the way back to the water, encouraging it with \par
more kicks when it slowed down, feeling the fragments of ice crunching all the \par
time beneath my boots... As it neared the Canal, it seemed to gain strength and \par
energy, as if it knew that it was approaching its natural home. I wondered if it \par
would survive, to bud again.\par
\par
    'It disappeared through the surface, leaving a few last dead larvae on the \par
alien land. The exposed free water bubbled for a few minutes until a scab of \par
protective ice sealed it from the vacuum above. Then I walked back to the ship \par
to see if there was anything to salvage - I don't want to talk about that...\par
\par
    'I've only two requests to make, Doctor. When the taxonomists classify this \par
creature, I hope they'll name it after me.\par
\par
    'And - when the next ship comes home - ask them to take our bones back to \par
China..\par
\par
    'Jupiter will be cutting us off in a few minutes. I wish I knew whether \par
anyone was receiving me. Anyway, I'll repeat this message when we're in line of \par
sight again - if my suit's life-support system lasts that long.\par
\par
    'This is Professor Chang on Europa, reporting the destruction of spaceship \par
Tsien. We landed beside the Grand Canal and set up our pumps at the edge of the \par
ice...'\par
\par
    The signal faded abruptly, came back for a moment, then disappeared \par
completely below the noise level. There would never be any further message from \par
Professor Chang; but it had already deflected Lawrence Tsung's ambitions into \par
space.\par
\par
\par
\par
    6\par
    The Greening of Ganymede\par
\par
\par
\par
    Rolf van der Berg was the right man, in the right place, at the right time; \par
no other combination would have worked. Which, of course, is how much of history \par
is made.\par
\par
    He was the right man because he was a second-generation Afrikaner refugee, \par
and a trained geologist; both factors were equally important. He was in the \par
right place, because that had to be the largest of the Jovian moons - third \par
outwards in the sequence Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto.\par
\par
    The time was not so critical, for the information had been ticking away like \par
a delayed-action bomb in the data banks for at least a decade. Van der Berg did \par
not encounter it until '57; even then it took him another year to convince \par
himself that he was not crazy - and it was '59 before he had quietly sequestered \par
the original records so that no-one could duplicate his discovery. Only then \par
could he safely give his full attention to the main problem: what to do next.\par
\par
    It had all begun, as is so often the case, with an apparently trivial \par
observation in a field which did not even concern van der Berg directly. His \par
job, as a member of the Planetary Engineering Task Force, was to survey and \par
catalogue the natural resources of Ganymede; he had little business fooling \par
around with the forbidden satellite next door.\par
\par
    But Europa was an enigma which no-one - least of all its immediate \par
neighbours - could ignore for long. Every seven days it passed between Ganymede \par
and the brilliant minisun that had once been Jupiter, producing eclipses which \par
could last as long as twelve minutes. At its closest, it appeared slightly \par
smaller than the Moon as seen from Earth, but it dwindled to a mere quarter of \par
that size when it was on the other side of its orbit.\par
\par
    The eclipses were often spectacular. Just before it slid between Ganymede \par
and Lucifer, Europa would become an ominous black disc, outlined with a ring of \par
crimson fire, as the light of the new sun was refracted through the atmosphere \par
it had helped to create.\par
\par
    In less than half a human lifetime, Europa had been transformed. The crust \par
of ice on the hemisphere always facing Lucifer had melted, to form the Solar \par
System's second ocean. For a decade it had foamed and bubbled into the vacuum \par
above it, until equilibrium had been reached. Now Europa possessed a thin but \par
serviceable - though not to human beings - atmosphere of water vapour, hydrogen \par
sulphide, carbon and sulphur dioxides, nitrogen, and miscellaneous rare gases. \par
Though the somewhat misnamed 'nightside' of the satellite was still permanently \par
frozen, an area as large as Africa now had a temperate climate, liquid water, \par
and a few scattered islands.\par
\par
    All this, and not much more, had been observed through telescopes in Earth \par
orbit. By the time that the first full-scale expedition had been launched to the \par
Galilean moons, in 2028, Europa had already become veiled by a permanent mantle \par
of clouds. Cautious radar probing revealed little but smooth ocean on one face, \par
and almost equally smooth ice on the other; Europa still maintained its \par
reputation as the flattest piece of real estate in the Solar System. Ten years \par
later, that was no longer true: something drastic had happened to Europa. It now \par
possessed a solitary mountain, almost as high as Everest, jutting up through the \par
ice of the twilight zone. Presumably some volcanic activity - like that \par
occurring ceaselessly on neighbouring Io - had thrust this mass of material \par
skywards. The vastly increased heat-flow from Lucifer could have triggered such \par
an event.\par
\par
    But there were problems with this obvious explanation. Mount Zeus was an \par
irregular pyramid, not the usual volcanic cone, and radar scans showed none of \par
the characteristic lava flows. Some poor-quality photographs obtained through \par
telescopes on Ganymede, during a momentary break in the clouds, suggested that \par
it was made of ice, like the frozen landscape around it. Whatever the answer, \par
the creation of Mount Zeus had been a traumatic experience for the world it \par
dominated, for the entire crazy-paving pattern of fractured ice floes over the \par
nightside had changed completely.\par
\par
    One maverick scientist had put forward the theory that Mount Zeus was a \par
'cosmic iceberg' - a cometary fragment that had dropped upon Europa from space; \par
battered Callisto gave ample proof that such bombardments had occurred in the \par
remote past. The theory was very unpopular on Ganymede, whose would-be colonists \par
already had sufficient problems.\par
\par
    They had been much relieved when van der Berg had refuted the theory \par
convincingly; any mass of ice this size would have shattered on impact - and \par
even if it hadn't, Europa's gravity, modest though it was, would have quickly \par
brought about its collapse. Radar measurements showed that though Mount Zeus was \par
indeed steadily sinking, its overall shape remained completely unaltered. Ice \par
was not the answer.\par
\par
    The problem could, of course, have been settled by sending a single probe \par
through the clouds of Europa. Unfortunately, whatever was beneath that almost \par
permanent overcast did not encourage curiosity.\par
\par
\par
\par
    ALL THESE WORLDS ARE YOURS - EXCEPT EUROPA.\par
    ATTEMPT NO LANDINGS THERE.\par
\par
\par
\par
    That last message relayed from the spaceship Discovery just before its \par
destruction had not been forgotten, but there had been endless arguments about \par
its interpretation. Did 'landings' refer to robot probes, or only to manned \par
vehicles? And what about close flybys - manned or unmanned? Or balloons floating \par
in the upper atmosphere?\par
\par
    The scientists were anxious to find out, but the general public was \par
distinctly nervous. Any power that could detonate the mightiest planet in the \par
Solar System was not to be trifled with. And it would take centuries to explore \par
and exploit Io, Ganymede, Callisto and the dozens of minor satellites; Europa \par
could wait.\par
\par
    More than once, therefore, van der Berg had been told not to waste his \par
valuable time on research of no practical importance, when there was so much to \par
be done on Ganymede. ('Where can we find carbon - phosphorus - nitrates for the \par
hydroponic farms? How stable is the Barnard Escarpment? Is there any danger of \par
more mudslides in Phrygia?' And so on and so forth...) But he had inherited his \par
Boer ancestors' well-deserved reputation for stubbornness: even when he was \par
working on his numerous other projects, he kept looking over his shoulder at \par
Europa.\par
\par
    And one day, just a few hours, a gale from the nightside cleared the skies \par
about Mount Zeus.\par
\par
\par
\par
    7\par
    Transit\par
\par
\par
\par
    'I too take leave of all 1 ever had...'\par
\par
    From what depths of memory had that line come swimming up to the surface? \par
Heywood Floyd closed his eyes, and tried to focus on the past. It was certainly \par
from a poem - and he had hardly read a line of poetry since leaving college. And \par
little enough then, except during a short English Appreciation Seminar.\par
\par
    With no further clues, it might take the station computer quite a while - \par
perhaps as much as ten minutes - to locate the line in the whole body of English \par
literature. But that would be cheating (not to mention expensive) and Floyd \par
preferred to accept the intellectual challenge.\par
\par
    A war poem, of course - but which war? There had been so many in the \par
twentieth century.\par
\par
    He was still searching through the mental mists when his guests arrived, \par
moving with the effortless, slow-motion grace of longtime one-sixth gravity \par
residents. The society of Pasteur was strongly influenced by what had been \par
christened 'centrifugal stratification'; some people never left the zero gee of \par
the hub, while those who hoped one day to return to Earth preferred the almost \par
normal-weight regime out on the rim of the huge, slowly revolving disc.\par
\par
    George and Jerry were now Floyd's oldest and closest friends - which was \par
surprising, because they had so few obvious points in common. Looking back on \par
his own somewhat chequered emotional career - two marriages, three formal \par
contracts, two informal ones, three children - he often envied the long-term \par
stability of their relationship, apparently quite unaffected by the 'nephews' \par
from Earth or Moon who visited them from time to time.\par
\par
    'Haven't you ever thought of divorce?' he had once asked them teasingly.\par
\par
    As usual, George - whose acrobatic yet profoundly serious conducting had \par
been largely responsible for the comeback of the classical orchestra - was at no \par
loss for words.\par
\par
    'Divorce - never,' was his swift reply. 'Murder - often.'\par
\par
    'Of course, he'd never get away with it,' Jerry had retorted. 'Sebastian \par
would spill the beans.'\par
\par
    Sebastian was a beautiful and talkative parrot which the couple had imported \par
after a long battle with the hospital authorities. He could not only talk, but \par
could reproduce the opening bars of the Sibelius Violin Concerto, with which \par
Jerry - considerably helped by Antonio Stradivari - had made his reputation half \par
a century ago.\par
\par
    Now the time had come to say goodbye to George, Jerry and Sebastian - \par
perhaps only for a few weeks, perhaps for ever. Floyd had already made all his \par
other farewells, in a round of parties that had gravely depleted the station's \par
wine cellar, and could think of nothing he had left undone.\par
\par
    Archie, his early-model but still perfectly serviceable comsec, had been \par
programmed to handle all incoming messages, either by sending out appropriate \par
replies or by routing anything urgent and personal to him aboard Universe. It \par
would be strange, after all these years, not to be able to talk to anyone he \par
wished - though in compensation he could also avoid unwanted callers. After a \par
few days into the voyage, the ship would be far enough from Earth to make real-\par
time conversation impossible, and all communication would have to be by recorded \par
voice or teletext.\par
\par
    'We thought you were our friend,' complained George. 'It was a dirty trick \par
to make us your executors - especially as you're not going to leave us \par
anything.'\par
\par
    'You may have a few surprises,' grinned Floyd. 'Anyway, Archie will take \par
care of all the details. I'd just like you to monitor my mail, in case there's \par
anything he doesn't understand.'\par
\par
    'If he won't, nor will we. What do we know about all your scientific \par
societies and that sort of nonsense?'\par
\par
    'They can look after themselves. Please see that the cleaning staff doesn't \par
mess things up too badly while I'm away - and, if I don't come back - here are a \par
few personal items I'd like delivered - mostly family.'\par
\par
    Family! There were pains, as well as pleasures, in living as long as he had \par
done.\par
\par
    It had been sixty-three - sixty-three! - years since Marion had died in that \par
air crash. Now he felt a twinge of guilt, because he could not even recall the \par
grief he must have known. Or at best, it was a synthetic reconstruction, not a \par
genuine memory.\par
\par
    What would they have meant to each other, had she still been alive? She \par
would have been just a hundred years old by now.\par
\par
    And now the two little girls he had once loved so much were friendly, grey-\par
haired strangers in their late sixties, with children - and grandchildren! - of \par
their own. At last count there had been nine on that side of the family; without \par
Archie's help, he would never be able to keep track of their names. But at least \par
they all remembered him at Christmas, through duty if not affection.\par
\par
    His second marriage, of course, had overlain the memories of his first, like \par
the later writing on a medieval palimpsest. That too had ended, fifty years ago, \par
somewhere between Earth and Jupiter. Though he had hoped for a reconciliation \par
with both wife and son, there had been time for only one brief meeting, among \par
all the welcoming ceremonies, before his accident exiled him to Pasteur.\par
\par
    The meeting had not been a success; nor had the second, arranged at \par
considerable expense and difficulty aboard the space hospital itself - indeed, \par
in this very room. Chris had been twenty then, and had just married; if there \par
was one thing that united Floyd and Caroline, it was disapproval of his choice.\par
\par
    Yet Helena had turned out remarkably well: she had been a good mother to \par
Chris II, born barely a month after the marriage. And when, like so many other \par
young wives, she was widowed by the Copernicus Disaster, she did not lose her \par
head.\par
\par
    There was a curious irony in the fact that both Chris I and II had lost \par
their fathers to space, though in very different ways. Floyd had returned \par
briefly to his eight-year-old son as a total stranger; Chris II had at least \par
known a father for the first decade of his life, before losing him for ever.\par
\par
    And where was Chris these days? Neither Caroline nor Helena - who were now \par
the best of friends - seemed to know whether he was on Earth or in space. But \par
that was typical; only postcards date-stamped CLAVIUS BASE had informed his \par
family of his first visit to the Moon.\par
\par
    Floyd's card was still taped prominently above his desk. Chris II had a good \par
sense of humour - and of history. He had mailed his grandfather that famous \par
photograph of the Monolith, looming over the spacesuited figures gathered round \par
it in the Tycho excavation, more than half a century ago. All the others in the \par
group were now dead, and the Monolith itself was no longer on the Moon. In 2006, \par
after much controversy, it had been brought to Earth and erected - an uncanny \par
echo of the main building - in the United Nations Plaza. It had been intended to \par
remind the human race that it was no longer alone; five years later, with \par
Lucifer blazing in the sky, no such reminder was needed.\par
\par
    Floyd's fingers were not very steady - sometimes his right hand seemed to \par
have a will of its own - as he unpeeled the card and slipped it into his pocket. \par
It would be almost the only personal possession he would take when he boarded \par
Universe.\par
\par
    'Twenty-five days - you'll be back before we've noticed you're gone,' said \par
Jerry. 'And by the way, is it true that you'll have Dimitri onboard?'\par
\par
    'That little Cossack!' snorted George. 'I conducted his Second Symphony, \par
back in '22.'\par
\par
    'Wasn't that when the First Violin threw up, during the largo?'\par
\par
    'No - that was Mahler, not Mihailovich. And anyway it was the brass, so \par
nobody noticed - except the unlucky tuba player, who sold his instrument the \par
next day.'\par
\par
    'You're making this up!'\par
\par
    'Of course. But give the old rascal my love, and ask him if he remembers \par
that night we had out in Vienna. Who else have you got aboard?'\par
\par
    'I've heard horrible rumours about press gangs,' said Jerry thoughtful1y.\par
\par
    'Greatly exaggerated, I can assure you. We've all been personally chosen by \par
Sir Lawrence for our intelligence, wit, beauty, charisma, or other redeeming \par
virtue.'\par
\par
    'Not expendability?'\par
\par
    'Well, now that you mention it, we've all had to sign a depressing legal \par
document, absolving Tsung Spacelines from every conceivable liability. My copy's \par
in that file, by the way.'\par
\par
    'Any chance of us collecting on it?' asked George hopefully.\par
\par
    'No - my lawyers say it's iron-clad. Tsung agrees to take me to Halley and \par
back, give me food, water, air, and a room with a view.'\par
\par
    'And in return?'\par
\par
    'When I get back I'll do my best to promote future voyages, make some video \par
appearances, write a few articles - all very reasonable, for the chance of a \par
lifetime. Oh yes - I'll also entertain my fellow passengers - and vice versa.'\par
\par
    'How? Song and dance?'\par
\par
    'Well, I hope to inflict selected portions of my memoirs on a captive \par
audience. But I don't think I'll be able to compete with the professionals. Did \par
you know that Yva Merlin will be on board?'\par
\par
    'What! How did they coax her out of that Park Avenue cell?'\par
\par
    'She must be a hundred and - oops, sorry, Hey.' 'She's seventy, plus or \par
minus five.'\par
\par
    'Forget the minus. I was just a kid when Napoleon came out.'\par
\par
    There was a long pause while each of the trio scanned his memories of that \par
famous work. Although some critics considered her Scarlett O'Hara to be her \par
finest role, to the general public Yva Merlin (n\'e9e Evelyn Miles, when she was \par
born in Cardiff, South Wales) was still identified with Josephine. Almost half a \par
century ago, David Griffin's controversial epic had delighted the French and \par
infuriated the British - though both sides now agreed that he had occasionally \par
allowed his artistic impulses to trifle with the historical record, notably in \par
the spectacular final sequence of the Emperor's coronation in Westminster Abbey.\par
\par
    'That's quite a scoop for Sir Lawrence,' said George thoughtfully.\par
\par
    'I think I can claim some credit for that. Her father was an astronomer - he \par
worked for me at one time - and she's always been quite interested in science. \par
So I made a few video calls.'\par
\par
    Heywood Floyd did not feel it necessary to add that, like a substantial \par
fraction of the human race, he had fallen in love with Yva ever since the \par
appearance of GWTW Mark II.\par
\par
    'Of course,' he continued, 'Sir Lawrence was delighted - but I had to \par
convince him that she had more than a casual interest in astronomy. Otherwise \par
the voyage could be a social disaster.'\par
\par
    'Which reminds me,' said George, producing a small package he had been not \par
very successfully hiding behind his back. 'We have a little present for you.'\par
\par
    'Can I open it now?'\par
\par
    'Do you think he should?' Jerry wondered anxiously.\par
\par
    'In that case, I certainly will,' said Floyd, untying the bright green \par
ribbon and unwrapping the paper.\par
\par
    Inside was a nicely framed painting. Although Floyd knew little of art, he \par
had seen it before; indeed, who could ever forget it?\par
\par
    The makeshift raft tossing on the waves was crowded with half-naked \par
castaways, some already moribund, others waving desperately at a ship on the \par
horizon. Beneath it was the caption:\par
\par
\par
\par
    THE RAFT OF THE MEDUSA\par
    (Theodore G\'e9ricault, 1791-1824)\par
\par
\par
\par
    And underneath that was the message, signed by George and Jerry: 'Getting \par
there is half the fun.'\par
\par
    'You're a pair of bastards, and I love you dearly,' said Floyd, embracing \par
them both. The ATTENTION light on Archie's keyboard was flashing briskly; it was \par
time to go.\par
\par
    His friends left in a silence more eloquent than words. For the last time, \par
Heywood Floyd looked around the little room that had been his universe for \par
almost half his life.\par
\par
    And suddenly he remembered how that poem ended:\par
\par
\par
\par
    'I have been happy: happy now I go.'\par
\par
\par

    Starfleet\par
\par
\par
\par
    Sir Lawrence Tsung was not a sentimental man, and was far too cosmopolitan \par
to take patriotism seriously - though as an undergraduate he had briefly sported \par
one of the artificial pigtails worn during the Third Cultural Revolution. Yet \par
the planetarium re-enactment of the Tsien disaster moved him deeply, and caused \par
him to focus much of his enormous influence and energy upon space.\par
\par
    Before long, he was taking weekend trips to the Moon, and had appointed his \par
son Charles (the thirty-two-million-so! one) as Vice-President of Tsung \par
Astrofreight. The new corporation had only two catapult-launched, hydrogen-\par
fuelled ramrockets of less than a thousand tons empty mass; they would soon be \par
obsolete, but they could provide Charles with the experience that, Sir Lawrence \par
was quite certain, would be needed in the decades ahead. For at long last, the \par
Space Age was truly about to begin.\par
\par
    Little more than half a century had separated the Wright Brothers and the \par
coming of cheap, mass air transportation; it had taken twice as long to meet the \par
far greater challenge of the Solar System.\par
\par
    Yet when Luis Alvarez and his team had discovered muon-catalysed fusion back \par
in the 1950s, it had seemed no more than a tantalizing laboratory curiosity, of \par
only theoretical interest. Just as the great Lord Rutherford had pooh-poohed the \par
prospects of atomic power, so Alvarez himself doubted that 'cold nuclear fusion' \par
would ever be of practical importance. Indeed, it was not until 2040 that the \par
unexpected and accidental manufacture of stable muonium-hydrogen 'compounds' had \par
opened up a new chapter of human history - exactly as the discovery of the \par
neutron had initiated the Atomic Age.\par
\par
    Now small, portable nuclear power plants could be built, with a minimum of \par
shielding. Such enormous investments had already been made in conventional \par
fusion that the world's electrical utilities were not - at first - affected, but \par
the impact on space travel was immediate; it could be paralleled only by the jet \par
revolution in air transport of a hundred years earlier.\par
\par
    No longer energy-limited, spacecraft could achieve far greater speeds; \par
flight times in the Solar System could now be measured in weeks rather than \par
months or even years. But the muon drive was still a reaction device - a \par
sophisticated rocket, no different in principle from its chemically fuelled \par
ancestors; it needed a working fluid to give it thrust. And the cheapest, \par
cleanest, and most convenient of all working fluids was - plain water.\par
\par
    The Pacific Spaceport was not likely to run short of this useful substance. \par
Matters were different at the next port of call - the Moon. Not a trace of water \par
had been discovered by the Surveyor, Apollo, and Luna missions. If the Moon had \par
ever possessed any native water, aeons of meteoric bombardment had boiled and \par
blasted it into space.\par
\par
    Or so the selenologists believed; yet clues to the contrary had been \par
visible, ever since Galileo had turned his first telescope upon the Moon. Some \par
lunar mountains, for a few hours after dawn, glitter as brilliantly as if they \par
are capped with snow. The most famous case is the rim of the magnificent crater \par
Aristarchus, which William Herschel, the father of modem astronomy, once \par
observed shining so brightly in the lunar night that he decided it must be an \par
active volcano. He was wrong; what he saw was the Earthlight reflected from a \par
thin and transient layer of frost, condensed during the three hundred hours of \par
freezing darkness.\par
\par
    The discovery of the great ice deposits beneath Schroter's Valley, the \par
sinuous canyon winding away from Anstarchus, was the last factor in the equation \par
that would transform the economics of space-flight. The Moon could provide a \par
filling station just where it was needed, high up on the outermost slopes of the \par
Earth's gravitational field, at the beginning of the long haul to the planets.\par
\par
    Cosmos, first of the Tsung fleet, had been designed to carry freight and \par
passengers on the Earth-Moon-Mars run, and as a test-vehicle, through complex \par
deals with a dozen organizations and governments, of the still experimental muon \par
drive. Built at the Imbriurn shipyards, she had just sufficient thrust to lift \par
off from the Moon with zero payload; operating from orbit to orbit, she would \par
never again touch the surface of any world. With his usual flair for publicity, \par
Sir Lawrence arranged for her maiden flight to commence on the hundredth \par
anniversary of Sputnik Day, 4 October 2057.\par
\par
    Two years later, Cosmos was joined by a sister ship. Galaxy was designed for \par
the Earth-Jupiter run, and had enough thrust to operate directly to any of the \par
Jovian moons, though at considerable sacrifice of payload. If necessary, she \par
could even return to her lunar berth for refitting. She was by far the swiftest \par
vehicle ever built by man: if she burned up her entire propellant mass in one \par
orgasm of acceleration, she would attain a speed of a thousand kilometres a \par
second - which would take her from Earth to Jupiter in a week, and to the \par
nearest star in not much more than ten thousand years.\par
\par
    The third ship of the fleet - and Sir Lawrence's pride and joy - embodied \par
all that had been learned in the building of her two sisters. But Universe was \par
not intended primarily for freight. She was designed from the beginning as the \par
first passenger liner to cruise the space lanes - right out to Saturn, the jewel \par
of the Solar System.\par
\par
    Sir Lawrence had planned something even more spectacular for her maiden \par
voyage, but construction delays caused by a dispute with the Lunar Chapter of \par
the Reformed Teamsters' Union had upset his schedule. There would just be time \par
for the initial flight tests and Lloyd's certification in the closing months of \par
2060, before Universe left Earth orbit for her rendezvous. It would be a very \par
close thing: Halley's Comet would not wait, even for Sir Lawrence Tsung.\par
\par
\par
\par
    9\par
    Mount Zeus\par
\par
\par
\par
    The survey satellite Europa VI had been in orbit for almost fifteen years, \par
and had far exceeded its design life; whether it should be replaced was a \par
subject of considerable debate in the small Ganymede scientific establishment.\par
\par
    It carried the usual collection of data-gathering instruments, as well as a \par
now virtually useless imaging system. Though still in perfect working order, all \par
that this normally showed of Europa was an unbroken cloudscape. The overworked \par
science team on Ganymede scanned the recordings in 'Quick Look' mode once a \par
week, then squirted the raw data back to Earth. On the whole, they would be \par
rather relieved when Europa VI expired and its torrent of uninteresting \par
gigabytes finally dried up.\par
\par
    Now, for the first time in years, it had produced something exciting.\par
\par
    'Orbit 71934,' said the Deputy Chief Astronomer, who had called van der Berg \par
as soon as the latest data-dump had been evaluated. 'Coming in from the \par
nightside - heading straight for Mount Zeus. You won't see anything for another \par
ten seconds, though.'\par
\par
    The screen was completely black, yet van der Berg could imagine the frozen \par
landscape rolling past beneath its blanket of clouds a thousand kilometres \par
below. In a few hours the distant Sun would be shining there, for Europa \par
revolved on its axis once in every seven Earth-days. 'Nightside' should really \par
be called 'Twilight-side', for half the time it had ample light - but no heat. \par
Yet the inaccurate name had stuck, because it had emotional validity: Europa \par
knew Sunrise, but never Lucifer-rise.\par
\par
    And the Sunrise was coming now, speeded up a thousandfold by the racing \par
probe. A faintly luminous band bisected the screen, as the horizon emerged from \par
darkness.\par
\par
    The explosion of light was so sudden that van der Berg could almost imagine \par
he was looking into the glare of an atomic bomb. In a fraction of a second, it \par
ran through all the colours of the rainbow, then became pure white as the Sun \par
leapt above the mountain - then vanished as the automatic filters cut into the \par
circuit.\par
\par
    'That's all; pity there was no operator on duty at the time - he could have \par
panned the camera down and had a good view of the mountain as we went over. But \par
I knew you'd like to see it - even though it disproves your theory.'\par
\par
    'How?' said van der Berg, more puzzled than annoyed.\par
\par
    'When you go through it in slow motion, you'll see what I mean. Those \par
beautiful rainbow effects - they're not atmospheric - they're caused by the \par
mountain itself. Only ice could do that. Or glass - which doesn't seem very \par
likely.'\par
\par
    'Not impossible - volcanoes can produce natural glass - but it's usually \par
black... of course!'\par
\par
    'Yes?'\par
\par
    'Er - I won't commit myself until I've been through the data. But my guess \par
would be rock crystal - transparent quartz. You can make beautiful prisms and \par
lenses out of it. Any chance of some more observations?'\par
\par
    'I'm afraid not - that was pure luck - Sun, mountain, camera all lined up at \par
the right time. It won't happen again in a thousand years.'\par
\par
    'Thanks, anyway - can you send me over a copy? No hurry - I'm just leaving \par
on a field trip to Perrine, and won't be able to look at it until I get back.'\par
\par
    Van der Berg gave a short, rather apologetic laugh.\par
\par
    'You know, if that really is rock crystal, it would be worth a fortune. \par
Might even help solve our balance of payments problem...'\par
\par
    But that, of course, was utter fantasy. Whatever wonders - or treasures - \par
Europa might conceal, the human race had been forbidden access to them, by that \par
last message from Discovery. Fifty years later, there was no sign that the \par
interdiction would ever be lifted.\par
\par
\par
\par
    10\par
    Ship of Fools\par
\par
\par
\par
    For the first forty-eight hours of the voyage, Heywood Floyd could not \par
really believe the comfort, the spaciousness - the sheer extravagance of \par
Universe's living arrangements. Yet most of his fellow passengers took them for \par
granted; those who had never left Earth before assumed that all spaceships must \par
be like this.\par
\par
    He had to look back at the history of aeronautics to put matters in the \par
right perspective. In his own lifetime, he had witnessed - indeed, experienced - \par
the revolution that had occurred in the skies of the planet now dwindling behind \par
him. Between the clumsy old Leonov and the sophisticated Universe lay exactly \par
fifty years. (Emotionally, he couldn't really believe that - but it was useless \par
arguing about arithmetic.)\par
\par
    And just fifty years had separated the Wright Brothers from the first jet \par
airliners. At the beginning of that half-century, intrepid aviators had hopped \par
from field to field, begoggled and windswept on open chairs; at its end, \par
grandmothers had slumbered peacefully between continents at a thousand \par
kilometres an hour.\par
\par
    So he should not, perhaps, have been astonished at the luxury and elegant \par
decor of his stateroom, or even the fact that he had a steward to keep it tidy. \par
The generously sized window was the most startling feature of his suite, and at \par
first he felt quite uncomfortable thinking of the tons of air pressure it was \par
holding in check against the implacable, and never for a moment relaxing, vacuum \par
of space.\par
\par
    The biggest surprise, even though the advance literature should have \par
prepared him for it, was the presence of gravity. Universe was the first \par
spaceship ever built to cruise under continuous acceleration, except for the few \par
hours of the mid-course 'turnaround'. When her huge propellant tanks were fully \par
loaded with their five thousand tons of water, she could manage a tenth of a gee \par
- not much, but enough to keep loose objects from drifting around. This was \par
particularly convenient at mealtimes - though it took a few days for the \par
passengers to learn not to stir their soup too vigorously.\par
\par
    Forty-eight hours out from Earth, the population of Universe had already \par
stratified itself into four distinct classes.\par
\par
    The aristocracy consisted of Captain Smith and his officers. Next came the \par
passengers; then crew - non-commissioned and stewards. And then steerage...\par
\par
    That was the description that the five young space scientists had adopted \par
for themselves, first as a joke but later with a certain amount of bitterness. \par
When Hoyd compared their cramped and jury-rigged quarters with his own luxurious \par
cabin, he could see their point of view, and soon became the conduit of their \par
complaints to the Captain.\par
\par
    Yet all things considered, they had little to grumble about; in the rush to \par
get the ship ready, it had been touch and go as to whether there would be any \par
accommodation for them and their equipment. Now they could look forward to \par
deploying instruments around - and on - the comet during the critical days \par
before it rounded the Sun, and departed once more to the outer reaches of the \par
Solar System. The members of the science team would establish their reputations \par
on this voyage, and knew it. Only in moments of exhaustion, or fury with \par
misbehaving instrumentation, did they start complaining about the noisy \par
ventilating system, the claustrophobic cabins, and occasional strange smells of \par
unknown origin.\par
\par
    But never the food, which everyone agreed was excellent. 'Much better,' \par
Captain Smith assured them, 'than Darwin had on the Beagle.'\par
\par
    To which Victor Willis had promptly retorted:\par
\par
    'How does he know? And by the way, Beagle's commander cut his throat when he \par
got back to England.'\par
\par
    That was rather typical of Victor, perhaps the planet's best-known science \par
communicator - to his fans - or 'pop-scientist' - to his equally numerous \par
detractors. It would be unfair to call them enemies; admiration for his talents \par
was universal, if occasionally grudging. His soft, mid-Pacific accent and \par
expansive gestures on camera were widely parodied, and he had been credited (or \par
blamed) for the revival of full-length beards. 'A man who grows that much hair,' \par
critics were fond of saying, 'must have a lot to hide.'\par
\par
    He was certainly the most instantly recognizable of the six VIPs - though \par
Floyd, who no longer regarded himself as a celebrity, always referred to them \par
ironically as 'The Famous Five'. Yva Merlin could often walk unrecognized on \par
Park Avenue, on the rare occasions when she emerged from her apartment. Dimitri \par
Mihailovich, to his considerable annoyance, was a good ten centimetres below \par
average height; this might help to explain his fondness for thousand-piece \par
orchestras - real or synthesized -but did not enhance his public image.\par
\par
    Clifford Greenburg and Margaret M'Bala also fell into the category of \par
'famous unknowns' - though this would certainly change when they got back to \par
Earth. The first man to land on Mercury had one of those pleasant, unremarkable \par
faces that are very hard to remember; moreover the days when he had dominated \par
the news were now thirty years in the past. And like most authors who are not \par
addicted to talk shows and autographing sessions, Ms M'Bala would be \par
unrecognized by the vast majority of her millions of readers.\par
\par
    Her literary fame had been one of the sensations of the forties. A scholarly \par
study of the Greek pantheon was not usually a candidate for the best-seller \par
lists, but Ms M'Bala had placed its eternally inexhaustible myths in a \par
contemporary space-age setting. Names which a century earlier had been familiar \par
only to astronomers and classical scholars were now part of every educated \par
person's world picture; almost every day there would be news from Ganymede, \par
Callisto, Io, Titan, Japetus - or even more obscure worlds like Carme, Pasipha\'eb, \par
Hyperion, Phoebe...\par
\par
    Her book would have been no more than modestly successful, however, had she \par
not focused on the complicated family life of Jupiter-Zeus, Father of all the \par
Gods (as well as much else). And by a stroke of luck, an editor of genius had \par
changed her original title, The View from Olympus, to The Passions of the Gods. \par
Envious academics usually referred to it as Olympic Lusts, but invariably wished \par
they had written it.\par
\par
    Not surprisingly, it was Maggie M - as she was quickly christened by her \par
fellow passengers - who first used the phrase Ship of Fools. Victor Willis \par
adopted it eagerly, and soon discovered an intriguing historical resonance. \par
Almost a century ago, Katherine Anne Porter had herself sailed with a group of \par
scientists and writers aboard an ocean liner to watch the launch of Apollo 17, \par
and the end of the first phase of lunar exploration.\par
\par
    'I'll think about it,' Ms M'Bala had remarked ominously, when this was \par
reported to her. 'Perhaps it's time for a third version. But I won't know, of \par
course, until we get back to Earth...'\par
\par
\par
\par
    11\par
    The Lie\par
\par
\par
\par
    It was many months before Rolf van der Berg could once again turn his \par
thoughts and energies towards Mount Zeus. The taming of Ganymede was a more than \par
full-time job, and he was away from his main office at Dardanus Base for weeks \par
at a time, surveying the route of the proposed Gilgamesh-Osiris monorail.\par
\par
    The geography of the third and largest Galilean moon had changed drastically \par
since the detonation of Jupiter - and it was still changing. The new sun that \par
had melted the ice of Europa was not as powerful here, four hundred thousand \par
kilometres further out - but it was warm enough to produce a temperate climate \par
at the centre of the face forever turned towards it. There were small, shallow \par
seas - some as large as Earth's Mediterranean - up to latitudes forty north and \par
south. Not many features still survived from the maps generated by the Voyager \par
missions back in the twentieth century. Melting permafrost and occasional \par
tectonic movements triggered by the same tidal forces operating on the two inner \par
moons made the new Ganymede a cartographer's nightmare.\par
\par
    But those very factors also made it a planetary engineer's paradise. Here \par
was the only world, except for the arid and much less hospitable Mars, on which \par
men might one day walk unprotected beneath an open sky. Ganymede had ample \par
water, all the chemicals of life, and - at least while Lucifer shone - a warmer \par
climate than much of Earth.\par
\par
    Best of all, full-body spacesuits were no longer necessary; the atmosphere, \par
though still unbreathable, was just dense enough to permit the use of simple \par
face-masks and oxygen cylinders. In a few decades - so the microbiologists \par
promised, though they were hazy about specific dates - even these could be \par
discarded. Strains of oxygen-generating bacteria had already been let loose \par
across the face of Ganymede; most had died but some had flourished, and the \par
slowly rising curve on the atmospheric analysis chart was the first exhibit \par
proudly displayed to all visitors at Dardanus.\par
\par
    For a long time, van der Berg kept a watchful eye on the data flowing in \par
from Europa VI, hoping that one day the clouds would clear again when it was \par
orbiting above Mount Zeus. He knew that the odds were against it, but while the \par
slightest chance existed he made no effort to explore any other avenue of \par
research. There was no hurry, he had far more important work on his hands - and \par
anyway, the explanation might turn out to be something quite trivial and \par
uninteresting.\par
\par
    Then Europa VI suddenly expired, almost certainly as a result of a random \par
meteoric impact. Back on Earth, Victor Willis had made rather a fool of himself \par
- in the opinion of many - by interviewing the 'Euronuts' who now more than \par
adequately filled the gap left by the UFO-enthusiasts of the previous century. \par
Some of them argued that the probe's demise was due to hostile action from the \par
world below: the fact that it had been allowed to operate without interference \par
for fifteen years - almost twice its design life - did not bother them in the \par
least. To Victor's credit, he stressed this point and demolished most of the \par
cultists' other arguments; but the consensus was that he should never have given \par
them publicity in the first place.\par
\par
    To van der Berg, who quite relished his colleagues' description of him as a \par
'stubborn Dutchman' and did his best to live up to it, the failure of Europa VI \par
was a challenge not to be resisted. There was not the slightest hope of funding \par
a replacement, for the silencing of the garrulous and embarrassingly long-lived \par
probe had been received with considerable relief.\par
\par
    So what was the alternative? Van der Berg sat down to consider his options. \par
Because he was a geologist, and not an astrophysicist, it was several days \par
before he suddenly realized that the answer had been staring him in the face \par
ever since he had landed on Ganymede.\par
\par
    Afrikaans is one of the world's best languages in which to curse; even when \par
spoken politely, it can bruise innocent bystanders. Van der Berg let off steam \par
for a few minutes; then he put through a call to the Tiamat Observatory - \par
sitting precisely on the equator, with the tiny, blinding disc of Lucifer \par
forever vertically overhead.\par
\par
\par
\par
    Astrophysicists, concerned with the most spectacular objects in the \par
Universe, tend to patronize mere geologists who devote their lives to small, \par
messy things like planets. But out here on the frontier, everyone helped \par
everyone else, and Dr Wilkins was not only interested but sympathetic.\par
\par
    The Tiamat Observatory had been built for a single purpose, which had indeed \par
been one of the main reasons for establishing a base on Ganymede. The study of \par
Lucifer was of enormous importance not only to pure scientists but also to \par
nuclear engineers, meteorologists, oceanographers - and, not least, to statesmen \par
and philosophers. That there were entities which could turn a planet into a sun \par
was a staggering thought, and had kept many awake at night. It would be well for \par
mankind to learn all it could about the process; one day there might be need to \par
imitate it - or prevent it.\par
\par
    And so for more than a decade Tiamat had been observing Lucifer with every \par
possible type of instrumentation, continually recording its spectrum across the \par
entire electromagnetic band, and also actively probing it with radar from a \par
modest hundred-metre dish, slung across a small impact crater.\par
\par
    'Yes,' said Dr Wilkins, 'we've often looked at Europa and Io. But our beam \par
is fixed on Lucifer, so we can only see them for a few minutes while they're in \par
transit. And your Mount Zeus is just on the dayside, so it's hidden from us \par
then.'\par
\par
    'I realize that,' said van der Berg a little impatiently. 'But couldn't you \par
offset the beam by just a little, so you could have a look at Europa before it \par
comes in line? Ten or twenty degrees would get you far enough into dayside.'\par
\par
    'One degree would be enough to miss Lucifer, and get Europa full-face on the \par
other side of its orbit. But then it would be more than three times further \par
away, so we'd only have a hundredth of the reflected power. Might work, though: \par
we'll give it a try. Let me have the specs on frequencies, wave envelopes, \par
polarization and anything else your remote-sensing people think will help. It \par
won't take us long to rig up a phase-shifting network that will slew the beam a \par
couple of degrees. More than that I don't know - it's not a problem we've ever \par
considered. Though perhaps we should have done so - anyway, what do you expect \par
to find on Europa, except ice and water?'\par
\par
    'If I knew,' said van der Berg cheerfully, 'I wouldn't be asking for help, \par
would I?'\par
\par
    'And I wouldn't be asking for full credit when you publish. Too bad my \par
name's at the end of the alphabet; you'll be ahead of me by only one letter.'\par
\par
    That was a year ago: the long-range scans hadn't been good enough, and \par
offsetting the beam to look on to Europa's dayside just before conjunction had \par
proved more difficult than expected. But at last the results were in; the \par
computers had digested them, and van der Berg was the first human being to look \par
at a mineralogical map of post-Lucifer Europa.\par
\par
    It was, as Dr Wilkins had surmised, mostly ice and water, with outcroppings \par
of basalt interspersed with deposits of sulphur. But there were two anomalies.\par
\par
    One appeared to be an artefact of the imaging process; there was an \par
absolutely straight feature, two kilometres long, which showed virtually no \par
radar echo. Van der Berg left Dr Wilkins to puzzle over that; he was only \par
concerned with Mount Zeus.\par
\par
    It had taken him a long time to make the identification, because only a \par
madman - or a really desperate scientist - would have dreamed that such a thing \par
was possible. Even now, though every parameter checked to the limits of \par
accuracy, he still could not really believe it. And he had not even attempted to \par
consider his next move.\par
\par
    When Dr Wilkins called, anxious to see his name and reputation spreading \par
through the data banks, he mumbled that he was still analysing the results. But \par
at last he could put it off no longer.\par
\par
    'Nothing very exciting,' he told his unsuspecting colleague. 'Merely a rare \par
form of quartz - I'm still trying to match it from Earth samples.'\par
\par
    It was the first time he had ever lied to a fellow scientist, and he felt \par
terrible about it.\par
\par
    But what was the alternative?\par
\par
\par
\par
    12\par
    Oom Paul\par
\par
\par
\par
    Rolf van der Berg had not seen his Uncle Paul for a decade, and it was not \par
likely that they would ever again meet in the flesh. Yet he felt very close to \par
the old scientist - the last of his generation, and the only one who could \par
recall (when he wished, which was seldom) his forefathers' way of life.\par
\par
    Dr Paul Kreuger - 'Oom Paul' to all his family and most of his friends - was \par
always there when he was needed, with information and advice, either in person \par
or at the end of a half-billion-kilometre radio link. Rumour had it that only \par
extreme political pressure had forced the Nobel Committee - with great \par
reluctance - to overlook his contributions to particle physics, now once more in \par
desperate disarray after the general house-cleaning at the end of the twentieth \par
century.\par
\par
    If this was true, Dr Kreuger bore no grudge. Modest and unassuming, he had \par
no personal enemies, even among the cantankerous factions of his fellow exiles. \par
Indeed, he was so universally respected that he had received several invitations \par
to re-visit the United States of Southern Africa, but had always politely \par
declined - not, he hastened to explain, because he felt he would be in any \par
physical danger in the USSA, but because he feared that the sense of nostalgia \par
would be overwhelming.\par
\par
    Even using the security of a language now understood by less than a million \par
people, van der Berg had been very discreet, and had used circumlocutions and \par
references that would be meaningless except to a close relative. But Paul had no \par
difficulty in understanding his nephew's message, though he could not take it \par
seriously. He was afraid young Rolf had made a fool of himself, and would let \par
him down as gently as possible. Just as well he hadn't rushed to publish: at \par
least he had the sense to keep quiet...\par
\par
\par
\par
    And suppose - just suppose - it was true? The scanty hairs rose on the back \par
of Paul's head. A whole spectrum of possibilities - scientific, financial, \par
political - suddenly opened up before his eyes, and the more he considered them, \par
the more awesome they appeared.\par
\par
    Unlike his devout ancestors, Dr Kreuger had no God to address in moments of \par
crisis or perplexity. Now, he almost wished he had; but even if he could pray, \par
that wouldn't really help. As he sat down at his computer and started to access \par
the data banks, he did not know whether to hope that his nephew had made a \par
stupendous discovery - or was talking utter nonsense. Could the Old One really \par
play such an incredible trick on mankind? Paul remembered Einstein's famous \par
comment that though He was subtle, He was never malicious.\par
\par
    Stop daydreaming, Dr Paul Kreuger told himself. Your likes or dislikes, your \par
hopes or fears, have absolutely nothing to do with the matter.\par
\par
    A challenge had been flung to him across half the width of the Solar System; \par
he would not know peace until he had uncovered the truth.\par
\par
\par
\par
    13\par
    'No-one told us to bring swimsuits...'\par
\par
\par
\par
    Captain Smith kept his little surprise until day five, just a few hours \par
before turnaround. His announcement was received, as he had expected, with \par
stunned incredulity.\par
\par
    Victor Willis was the first to recover.\par
\par
    'A swimming pool! In a spaceship! You must be joking!'\par
\par
    The Captain leaned back and prepared to enjoy himself. He grinned at Heywood \par
Floyd who had already been let into the secret.\par
\par
    'Well, I suppose Columbus would have been amazed at some of the facilities \par
on the ships that came after him.'\par
\par
    'Is there a diving board?' asked Greenburg wistfully. 'I used to be college \par
champion.'\par
\par
    'As a matter of fact - yes. It's only five metres - but that will give you \par
three seconds of free fall, at our nominal tenth of a gee. And if you want a \par
longer time, I'm sure Mr Curtis will be happy to reduce thrust.'\par
\par
    'Indeed?' said the Chief Engineer dryly. 'And mess up all my orbit \par
calculations? Not to mention the risk of the water crawling out, Surface \par
tension, you know...\par
\par
    'Wasn't there a space station once that had a spherical swimming pool?' \par
somebody asked.\par
\par
    'They tried it at the hub of Pasteur, before they started the spin,' \par
answered Floyd. 'It just wasn't practical. In zero gravity, it had to be \par
completely enclosed. And you could drown rather easily inside a big sphere of \par
water, if you panicked.'\par
\par
    'One way of getting into the record books - first person to drown in \par
space...'\par
\par
    'No-one told us to bring swimsuits,' complained Maggie M'Bala.\par
\par
    'Anyone who has to wear a swimsuit probably should,' Mihailovich whispered \par
to Floyd.\par
\par
    Captain Smith rapped on the table to restore order. 'This is more important, \par
please. As you know, at midnight we reach maximum speed, and have to start \par
braking. So the drive will shut down at 23.00, and the ship will be reversed. \par
We'll have two hours of weightlessness before we commence thrust again at 01.00.\par
\par
    'As you can imagine, the crew will be rather busy - we'll use the \par
opportunity for an engine check and a hull inspection, which can't be done while \par
we're under power. I strongly advise you to be sleeping then, with the restraint \par
straps lightly fastened across your beds. The stewards will check that there \par
aren't any loose articles that could cause trouble when weight comes on again. \par
Questions?'\par
\par
    There was a profound silence, as if the assembled passengers were still \par
somewhat stunned by the revelation and were deciding what to do about it.\par
\par
    'I was hoping you'd ask me about the economics of such a luxury - but as you \par
haven't, I'll tell you anyway. It's not a luxury at all - it doesn't cost a \par
thing, but we hope it will be a very valuable asset on future voyages.\par
\par
    'You see, we have to carry five thousand tons of water as reaction mass, so \par
we might as well make the best use of it. Number One tank is now three-quarters \par
empty; we'll keep it that way until the end of the voyage. So after breakfast \par
tomorrow - see you down at the beach...\par
\par
\par
\par
    Considering the rush to get Universe spaceborne, it was surprising that such \par
a good job had been done on something so spectacularly non-essential.\par
\par
    The 'beach' was a metal platform, about five metres wide, curving around a \par
third of the great tank's circumference. Although the far wall was only another \par
twenty metres away, clever use of projected images made it seem at infinity. \par
Borne on the waves in the middle distance, surfers were heading towards a shore \par
which they would never reach, Beyond them, a beautiful passenger clipper which \par
any travel agent would recognize instantly as Tsung Sea-Space Corporation's Tai-\par
Pan was racing along the horizon under a full spread of sail.\par
\par
    To complete the illusion, there was sand underfoot (slightly magnetized, so \par
it would not stray too far from its appointed place) and the short length of \par
beach ended in a grove of palm trees which were quite convincing, until examined \par
too closely. Overhead, a hot tropical sun completed the idyllic picture; it was \par
hard to realize that just beyond these walls the real Sun was shining, now twice \par
as fiercely as on any terrestrial beach.\par
\par
    The designer had really done a wonderful job, in the limited space \par
available. It seemed a little unfair of Greenburg to complain: 'Pity there's no \par
surf...'\par
\par
\par
\par
    14\par
    Search\par
\par
\par
\par
    It is a good principle in science not to believe any 'fact' - however well-\par
attested - until it fits into some accepted frame of reference. Occasionally, of \par
course, an observation can shatter the frame and force the construction of a new \par
one, but that is extremely rare. Galileos and Einsteins seldom appear more than \par
once per century, which is just as well for the equanimity of mankind.\par
\par
    Dr Kreuger fully accepted this principle: he would not believe his nephew's \par
discovery until he could explain it, and as far as he could see that required \par
nothing less than a direct Act of God. Wielding Occam's still highly serviceable \par
razor, he thought it somewhat more probable that Rolf had made a mistake; if so, \par
it should be fairly easy to find it.\par
\par
    To Uncle Paul's great surprise, it proved very difficult indeed. The \par
analysis of radar remote-sensing observations was now a venerable and well-\par
established art, and the experts that Paul consulted all gave the same answer, \par
after considerable delay. They also asked: 'Where did you get that recording?'\par
\par
    'Sorry,' he had answered. 'I'm not at liberty to say.'\par
\par
    The next step was to assume that the impossible was correct, and to start \par
searching the literature. This could be an enormous job, for he did not even \par
know where to begin. One thing was quite certain: a brute-force, head-on attack \par
was bound to fail. It would be just as if Roentgen, the morning after he had \par
discovered X-rays, had started to hunt for their explanation in the physics \par
journals of his day. The information he needed still lay years in the future.\par
\par
    But there was at least a sporting chance that what he was looking for was \par
hidden somewhere in the immense body of existing scientific knowledge. Slowly \par
and carefully, Paul Kreuger set up an automatic search programme, designed for \par
what it would exclude as much as what it would embrace. It should cut out all \par
Earth-related references - they would certainly number in the millions - and \par
concentrate entirely on extraterrestrial citations.\par
\par
    One of the benefits of Dr Kreuger's eminence was an unlimited computer \par
budget: that was part of the fee he demanded from the various organizations who \par
needed his wisdom. Though this search might be expensive, he did not have to \par
worry about the bill.\par
\par
    As it turned out, this was surprisingly small. He was lucky: the search came \par
to an end after only two hours thirty-seven minutes, at the 21,456th reference.\par
\par
    The title was enough. Paul was so excited that his own comsec refused to \par
recognize his voice, and he had to repeat the command for a full print-out.\par
\par
    Nature had published the paper in 1981 - almost five years before he was \par
born! - and as his eyes swept swiftly over its single page he knew not only that \par
his nephew had been right all along - but, just as important, exactly how such a \par
miracle could occur.\par
\par
    The editor of that eighty-year-old journal must have had a good sense of \par
humour. A paper discussing the cores of the outer planets was not something to \par
grab the usual reader: this one, however, had an unusually striking title. His \par
comsec could have told him quickly enough that it had once been part of a famous \par
song, but that of course was quite irrelevant.\par
\par
    Anyway, Paul Kreuger had never heard of the Beatles, and their psychedelic \par
fantasies.\par
\par
\par
\par
    II\par
    THE VALLEY OF THE BLACK SNOW\par
\par
\par
\par
    15\par
    Rendezvous\par
\par
\par
\par
    And now Halley was too close to be seen; ironically, observers back on Earth \par
would get a far better view of the tail, already stretching fifty million \par
kilometres at right angles to the comet's orbit, like a pennant fluttering in \par
the invisible gale of the solar wind.\par
\par
    On the morning of the rendezvous, Heywood Floyd woke early from a troubled \par
sleep. It was unusual for him to dream - or at least to remember his dreams - \par
and doubtless the anticipated excitements of the next few hours were \par
responsible. He was also slightly worried by a message from Caroline, asking if \par
he had heard from Chris lately. He had radioed back, a little tersely, that \par
Chris had never bothered to say thank you when he had helped him get his current \par
position on Universe's sister ship Cosmos; perhaps he was already bored with the \par
Earth-Moon run and was looking for excitement elsewhere.\par
\par
    'As usual,' Floyd had added, 'we'll hear from him in his own good time.'\par
\par
    Immediately after breakfast, passengers and science team had gathered for a \par
final briefing from Captain Smith. The scientists certainly did not need it, but \par
if they felt any irritation, so childish an emotion would have been quickly \par
swept away by the weird spectacle on the main viewscreen.\par
\par
    It was easier to imagine that Universe was flying into a nebula, rather than \par
a comet. The entire sky ahead was now a misty white fog - not uniform, but \par
mottled with darker condensations and streaked with luminous bands and brightly \par
glowing jets, all radiating away from a central point. At this magnification, \par
the nucleus was barely visible as a tiny black speck, yet it was clearly the \par
source of all the phenomena around it.\par
\par
    'We cut our drive in three hours,' said the Captain. 'Then we'll be only a \par
thousand kilometres away from the nucleus, with virtually zero velocity. We'll \par
make some final observations, and confirm our landing site.'\par
\par
    'So we'll go weightless at 12.00 exactly. Before then, your cabin stewards \par
will check that everything's correctly stowed. It will be just like turnaround, \par
except that this time it's going to be three days, not two hours, before we have \par
weight again.\par
\par
    'Halley's gravity? Forget it - less than one centimetre per second squared - \par
just about a thousandth of Earth's. You'll be able to detect it if you wait long \par
enough, but that's all. Takes fifteen seconds for something to fall a metre.\par
\par
    'For safety, I'd like you all here in the observation lounge, with your seat \par
belts properly secured, during rendezvous and touchdown. You'll get the best \par
view from here anyway, and the whole operation won't take more than an hour. \par
We'll only be using very small thrust corrections, but they may come from any \par
angle and could cause minor sensory disturbances.'\par
\par
    What the Captain meant, of course, was spacesickness - but that word, by \par
general agreement, was taboo aboard Universe. It was noticeable, however, that \par
many hands strayed into the compartments beneath the seats, as if checking that \par
the notorious plastic bags would be available if urgently required.\par
\par
    The image on the viewscreen expanded, as the magnification was increased. \par
For a moment it seemed to Floyd that he was in an aeroplane, descending through \par
light clouds, rather than in a spacecraft approaching the most famous of all \par
comets. The nucleus was growing larger and clearer; it was no longer a black \par
dot, but an irregular ellipse - now a small, pockmarked island lost in the \par
cosmic ocean - then, suddenly, a world in its own right.\par
\par
    There was still no sense of scale. Although Floyd knew that the whole \par
panorama spread before him was less than ten kilometres across, he could easily \par
have imagined that he was looking at a body as large as the Moon. But the Moon \par
was not hazy around the edges, nor did it have little jets of vapour - and two \par
large ones - spurting from its surface.\par
\par
    'My God!' cried Mihailovich, 'what's that?'\par
\par
    He pointed to the lower edge of the nucleus, just inside the terminator. \par
Unmistakably - impossibly -a light was flashing there on the nightside of the \par
comet with a perfectly regular rhythm: on, off, on, off, once every two or three \par
seconds.\par
\par
    Dr Willis gave his patient 'I can explain it to you in words of one \par
syllable' cough, but Captain Smith got there first.\par
\par
    'I'm sorry to disappoint you, Mr Mihailovich. That's only the beacon on \par
Sampler Probe Two - it's been sitting there for a month, waiting for us to come \par
and pick it up.'\par
\par
    'What a shame; I thought there might be someone - something - there to \par
welcome us.'\par
\par
    'No such luck, I'm afraid; we're very much on our own out here. That beacon \par
is just where we intend to land - it's near Halley's south pole and is in \par
permanent darkness at the moment. That will make it easier on our life-support \par
systems. The temperature's up to 120 degrees on the Sunlit side - way above \par
boiling point.'\par
\par
    'No wonder the comet's perking,' said the unabashed Dimitri. 'Those jets \par
don't look very healthy to me. Are you sure it's safe to go in?'\par
\par
    'That's another reason we're touching down on the nightside; there's no \par
activity there. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must get back to the bridge. This is \par
the first chance I've ever had of landing on a new world - and I doubt if I'll \par
get another.'\par
\par
    Captain Smith's audience dispersed slowly, and in unusual silence. The image \par
on the viewscreen zoomed back to normal, and the nucleus dwindled once more to a \par
barely visible spot. Yet even in those few minutes it seemed to have grown \par
slightly larger, and perhaps that was no illusion. Less than four hours before \par
encounter, the ship was still hurtling towards the comet at fifty thousand \par
kilometres an hour.\par
\par
    It would make a crater more impressive than any that Halley now boasted, if \par
something happened to the main drive at this stage of the game.\par
\par
\par
\par
    16\par
    Touchdown\par
\par
\par
\par
    The landing was just as anticlimactic as Captain Smith had hoped. It was \par
impossible to tell the moment when Universe made contact; a full minute elapsed \par
before the passengers realized that touchdown was complete, and raised a belated \par
cheer.\par
\par
    The ship lay at one end of a shallow valley, surrounded by hills little more \par
than a hundred metres high. Anyone who had been expecting to see a lunar \par
landscape would have been greatly surprised; these formations bore no \par
resemblance at all to the smooth, gentle slopes of the Moon, sand-blasted by \par
micrometeorite bombardment over billions of years.\par
\par
    There was nothing here more than a thousand years old; the Pyramids were far \par
more ancient than this landscape. Every time around the Sun, Halley was \par
remoulded - and diminished - by the solar fires. Even since the 1986 perihelion \par
passage, the shape of the nucleus had been subtly changed. Melding metaphors \par
shamelessly, Victor Willis had nevertheless put it rather well when he told his \par
viewers: 'The "peanut" has become wasp-waisted!'\par
\par
    Indeed, there were indications that, after a few more revolutions round the \par
Sun, Halley might split into two roughly equal fragments - as had Biela's comet, \par
to the amazement of the astronomers of 1846.\par
\par
    The virtually non-existent gravity also contributed to the strangeness of \par
the landscape. All around were spidery formations like the fantasies of a \par
surrealistic artist, and improbably canted rockpiles that could not have \par
survived more than a few minutes even on the Moon.\par
\par
    Although Captain Smith had chosen to land Universe in the depths of the \par
polar night - all of five kilometres from the blistering heat of the Sun - there \par
was ample illumination. The huge envelope of gas and dust surrounding the comet \par
formed a glowing halo which seemed appropriate for this region; it was easy to \par
imagine that it was an aurora, playing over the Antarctic ice. And if that was \par
not sufficient, Lucifer provided its quota of several hundred full moons.\par
\par
    Although expected, the complete absence of colour was a disappointment; \par
Universe might have been sitting in an opencast coal mine: that, in fact, was \par
not a bad analogy, for much of the surrounding blackness was due to carbon or \par
its compounds, intimately mixed with snow and ice.\par
\par
    Captain Smith, as was his due, was the first to leave the ship, pushing \par
himself gently out from Universe's main airlock. It seemed an eternity before he \par
reached the ground, two metres below; then he picked up a handful of the powdery \par
surface, and examined it in his gloved hand.\par
\par
    Aboard the ship, everyone waited for the words that would go into the \par
history books.\par
\par
    'Looks like pepper and salt,' said the Captain. 'If it were thawed out, it \par
might grow a pretty good crop.'\par
\par
\par
\par
    * * *\par
\par
\par
\par
    The mission plan involved one complete Halley 'day' of fifty-five hours at \par
the south pole, then - if there were no problems - a move of ten kilometres \par
towards the very ill-defined equator, to study one of the geysers during a \par
complete day-night cycle.\par
\par
    Chief Scientist Pendrill wasted no time. Almost immediately, he set off with \par
a colleague on a two-man jet-sled towards the beacon of the waiting probe. They \par
were back within the hour, bearing prepackaged samples of comet which they \par
proudly consigned to the deep-freeze.\par
\par
    Meanwhile the other teams established a spider's web of cables along the \par
valley, strung between poles driven into the friable crust. These served not \par
only to link numerous instruments to the ship, but also made movement outside \par
much easier. One could explore this portion of Halley without the use of \par
cumbersome External Manoeuvring Units; it was only necessary to attach a tether \par
to a cable, and then go along it hand over hand. That was also much more fun \par
than operating EMUs, which were virtually one-man spaceships with all the \par
complications they involved.\par
\par
    The passengers watched all this with fascination, listening to the radioed \par
conversations and trying to join in the excitement of discovery. After about \par
twelve hours - considerably less in the case of ex-astronaut Clifford Greenburg \par
- the pleasure of being a captive audience started to pall. Soon there was much \par
talk about 'going outside' except from Victor Willis who was quite \par
uncharacteristically subdued.\par
\par
    'I think he's scared,' said Dimitri contemptuously. He had never liked \par
Victor, since discovering that the scientist was completely tone-deaf. Though \par
this was wildly unfair to Victor (who had gamely allowed himself to be used as a \par
guinea pig for studies of his curious affliction) Dimitri was fond of adding \par
darkly 'A man that hath no music in himself, Is fit for treasons, stratagems and \par
spoils.'\par
\par
    Floyd had made up his mind even before leaving Earth orbit. Maggie M was \par
game enough to try anything and would need no encouragement. (Her slogan 'An \par
author should never turn down the opportunity for a new experience' had impacted \par
famously on her emotional life.)\par
\par
    Yva Merlin, as usual, had kept everyone in suspense, but Floyd was \par
determined to take her on a personal tour of the comet. It was the very least he \par
could do to maintain his reputation; everyone knew that he had been partly \par
responsible for getting the fabulous recluse on the passenger list, and now it \par
was a running joke that they were having an affair. Their most innocent remarks \par
were gleefully misinterpreted by Dimitri and the ship's physician Dr Mahindran, \par
who professed to regard them with envious awe.\par
\par
    After some initial annoyance - because it all too accurately recalled the \par
emotions of his youth - Floyd had gone along with the joke. But he did not know \par
how Yva felt about it, and had so far lacked the courage to ask her. Even now, \par
in this compact little society where few secrets lasted more than six hours, she \par
maintained much of her famous reserve - that aura of mystery which had \par
fascinated audiences for three generations.\par
\par
    As for Victor Willis, he had just discovered one of those devastating little \par
details that can destroy the best-laid plans of mice and spacemen.\par
\par
    Universe was equipped with the latest Mark XX suits, with non-fogging, non-\par
reflective visors guaranteed to give an unparalleled view of space. And though \par
the helmets came in several sizes, Victor Willis could not get into any of them \par
without major surgery.\par
\par
    It had taken him fifteen years to perfect his trademark ('a triumph of the \par
topiary art,' one critic had called it, perhaps admiringly).\par
\par
    Now only his beard stood between Victor Willis and Halley's Comet. Soon he \par
would have to make a choice between the two.\par
\par
\par
\par
    17\par
    The Valley of Black Snow\par
\par
\par
\par
    Captain Smith had raised surprisingly few objections to the idea of \par
passenger EVAs. He agreed that to have come all this way, and not to set foot \par
upon the comet, was absurd.\par
\par
    'There'll be no problems if you follow instructions,' he said at the \par
inevitable briefing. 'Even if you've never worn spacesuits before - and I \par
believe that only Commander Greenburg and Dr Floyd have done so - they're quite \par
comfortable, and fully automatic. There's no need to bother about any controls \par
or adjustments, after you've been checked out in the airlock.\par
\par
    'One absolute rule: only two of you can go EVA at one time. You'll have a \par
personal escort, of course, linked to you by five metres of safety line - though \par
that can be played out to twenty if necessary. In addition, you'll both be \par
tethered to the two guide-cables we've strung the whole length of the valley. \par
The rule of the road is the same as on Earth; keep to the right! If you want to \par
overtake anyone, you only have to unclip your buckle - but one of you must \par
always remain attached to the line. That way, there's no danger of drifting off \par
into space. Any questions?'\par
\par
    'How long can we stay out?'\par
\par
    'As long as you like, Ms M'Bala. But I recommend that you return just as \par
soon as you feel the slightest discomfort. Perhaps an hour would be best for the \par
first outing - though it may seem like only ten minutes...'\par
\par
    Captain Smith had been quite correct. As Heywood Floyd looked at his time-\par
elapsed display, it seemed incredible that forty minutes had already passed. Yet \par
it should not have been so surprising, for the ship was already a good kilometre \par
away.\par
\par
    As the senior passenger - by almost any reckoning - he had been given the \par
privilege of making the first EVA. And he really had no choice of companion.\par
\par
    'EVA with Yva!' chortled Mihailovich. 'How can you possibly resist! Even \par
if,' he added with a lewd grin, 'those damn suits won't let you try all the \par
Extravehicular Activities you'd like,'\par
\par
    Yva had agreed, without any hesitation, yet also without any enthusiasm. \par
That, Floyd thought wryly, was typical. It would not be quite true to say that \par
he was disillusioned - at his age, he had very few illusions left - but he was \par
disappointed. And with himself rather than Yva; she was as beyond criticism or \par
praise as the Mona Lisa - with whom she had often been compared.\par
\par
    The comparison was, of course, ridiculous; La Gioconda was mysterious, but \par
she was certainly not erotic. Yva's power had lain in her unique combination of \par
both - with innocence thrown in for good measure. Half a century later, traces \par
of all three ingredients were still visible, at least to the eye of faith.\par
\par
    What was lacking - as Floyd had been sadly forced to admit - was any real \par
personality. When he tried to focus his mind upon her, all he could visualize \par
were the roles she had played. He would have reluctantly agreed with the critic \par
who had once said:\par
\par
    'Yva Merlin is the reflection of all men's desires; but a mirror has no \par
character.'\par
\par
    And now this unique and mysterious creature was floating beside him across \par
the face of Halley's Comet, as they and their guide moved along the twin cables \par
that spanned the Valley of Black Snow. That was his name; he was childishly \par
proud of it, even though it would never appear on any map. There could be no \par
maps of a world where geography was as ephemeral as weather on Earth. He \par
savoured the knowledge that no human eye had ever before looked upon the scene \par
around him - or ever would again.\par
\par
    On Mars, or on the Moon, you could sometimes -with a slight effort of \par
imagination, and if you ignored the alien sky - pretend that you were on Earth. \par
This was impossible here, because the towering - often overhanging - snow \par
sculptures showed only the slightest concession to gravity. You had to look very \par
carefully at your surroundings to decide which way was up.\par
\par
    The Valley of Black Snow was unusual, because it was a fairly solid \par
structure - a rocky reef embedded in volatile drifts of water and hydrocarbon \par
ice. The geologists were still arguing about its origin, some maintaining that \par
it was really part of an asteroid that had encountered the comet ages ago. \par
Corings had revealed complex mixtures of organic compounds, rather like frozen \par
coal-tar - though it was certain that life had never played any part in their \par
formation.\par
\par
    The 'snow' carpeting of the floor of the little valley was not completely \par
black; when Floyd raked it with the beam of his flashlight it glittered and \par
sparkled as if embedded with a million microscopic diamonds. He wondered if \par
there were indeed diamonds on Halley: there was certainly enough carbon here. \par
But it was almost equally certain that the temperatures and pressures necessary \par
to create them had never existed here.\par
\par
    On a sudden impulse, Floyd reached down and gathered two handfuls of the \par
snow: he had to push with his feet against the safety line to do so, and had a \par
comic vision of himself as a trapeze artist walking a tightrope - but upside \par
down. The fragile crust offered virtually no resistance as he buried head and \par
shoulders into it; then he pulled gently on his tether and emerged with his \par
handful of Halley.\par
\par
    He wished that he could feel it through the insulation of his gloves, as he \par
compacted the mass of crystalline fluff into a ball that just fitted the palm of \par
his hand. There it lay, ebony black yet giving fugitive flashes of light as he \par
turned it from side to side.\par
\par
    And suddenly, in his imagination, it became the purest white - and he was a \par
boy again, in the winter playground of his youth, surrounded with the ghosts of \par
his childhood. He could even hear the cries of his companions, taunting and \par
threatening him with their own projectiles of immaculate snow...\par
\par
    The memory was brief, but shattering, for it brought an overwhelming \par
sensation of sadness. Across a century of time, he could no longer remember a \par
single one of those phantom friends who stood around him; yet some, he knew, he \par
had once loved...\par
\par
    His eyes filled with tears, and his fingers clenched around the ball of \par
alien snow. Then the vision faded; he was himself again. This was not a moment \par
of sadness, but of triumph.\par
\par
    'My God!' cried Heywood Floyd, his words echoing in the tiny, reverberant \par
universe of his spacesuit, 'I'm standing on Halley's Comet - what more do I \par
want! If a meteor hits me now, I won't have a single complaint!'\par
\par
    He brought up his arms and launched the snowball towards the stars. It was \par
so small, and so dark, that it vanished almost at once, but he kept on staring \par
into the sky.\par
\par
    And then, abruptly - unexpectedly - it appeared in a sudden explosion of \par
light, as it rose into the rays of the hidden Sun. Black as soot though it was, \par
it reflected enough of that blinding brilliance to be easily visible against the \par
faintly luminous sky.\par
\par
    Floyd watched it until it finally disappeared - perhaps by evaporation, \par
perhaps by dwindling into the distance. It would not last long in the fierce \par
torrent of radiation overhead; but how many men could claim to have created a \par
comet of their own?\par
\par
\par
\par
    18\par
    'Old Faithful'\par
\par
\par
\par
    The cautious exploration of the comet had already begun while Universe still \par
remained in the polar shadow. First, one-man EMUs (few people now knew that \par
stood for External Manoeuvring Unit) gently jetted over both day- and nightside, \par
recording everything of interest. Once the preliminary surveys had been \par
completed, groups of up to five scientists flew out in the onboard shuttle, \par
deploying equipment and instruments at strategic spots.\par
\par
    The Lady Jasmine was a far cry from the primitive 'space pods' of the \par
Discovery era, capable of operating only in a gravity-free environment. She was \par
virtually a small spaceship, designed to ferry personnel and light cargo between \par
the orbiting Universe and the surfaces of Mars, Moon, or the Jovian satellites. \par
Her chief pilot, who treated her like the grande dame she was, complained with \par
mock bitterness that flying round a miserable little comet was far beneath her \par
dignity.\par
\par
    When he was quite sure that Halley - on the surface at least - held no \par
surprises, Captain Smith lifted away from the pole. Moving less than a dozen \par
kilometres took Universe to a different world, from a glimmering twilight that \par
would last for months to a realm that knew the cycle of night and day. And with \par
the dawn, the comet came slowly to life.\par
\par
    As the Sun crept above the jagged, absurdly close horizon, its rays would \par
slant down into the countless small craters that pockmarked the crust. Most of \par
them would remain inactive, their narrow throats sealed by incrustations of \par
mineral salts. Nowhere else on Halley were such vivid displays of colour; they \par
had misled biologists into thinking that here life was beginning, as it had on \par
Earth, in the form of algal growths. Many had not yet abandoned that hope, \par
though they would be reluctant to admit it.\par
\par
    From other craters, wisps of vapour floated up into the sky, moving in \par
unnaturally straight trajectories because there were no winds to divert them. \par
Usually nothing else happened for an hour or two; then, as the Sun's warmth \par
penetrated to the frozen interior, Halley would begin to spurt - as Victor \par
Willis had put it 'like a pod of whales'.\par
\par
    Though picturesque, it was not one of his more accurate metaphors. The jets \par
from the dayside of Halley were not intermittent, but played steadily for hours \par
at a time. And they did not curl over and fall back to the surface, but went \par
rising on up into the sky, until they were lost in the glowing fog which they \par
helped create.\par
\par
    At first, the science team treated the geysers as cautiously as if they were \par
vulcanologists approaching Etna or Vesuvius in one of their less predictable \par
moods. But they soon discovered that Halley's eruptions, though often fearsome \par
in appearance, were singularly gentle and well-behaved; the water emerged about \par
as fast as from an ordinary firehose, and was barely warm. Within seconds of \par
escaping from its underground reservoir, it would flash into a mixture of vapour \par
and ice crystals; Halley was enveloped in a perpetual snowstorm, falling \par
upwards... Even at this modest speed of ejection, none of the water would ever \par
return to its source. Each time it rounded the Sun, more of the comet's life-\par
blood would haemorrhage into the insatiable vacuum of space.\par
\par
    After considerable persuasion, Captain Smith agreed to move Universe to \par
within a hundred metres of 'Old Faithful', the largest geyser on the dayside. It \par
was an awesome sight - a whitish-grey column of mist, growing like some giant \par
tree from a surprisingly small orifice in a three-hundred-metre-wide crater \par
which appeared to be one of the oldest formations on the comet. Before long, the \par
scientists were scrambling all over the crater, collecting specimens of its \par
(completely sterile, alas) multi-coloured minerals, and casually thrusting their \par
thermometers and sampling tubes into the soaring water-ice-mist column itself. \par
'If it tosses any of you out into space,' warned the Captain, 'don't expect to \par
be rescued in a hurry. In fact, we may just wait until you come back.'\par
\par
    'What does he mean by that?' a puzzled Dimitri Mihailovich had asked. As \par
usual, Victor Willis was quick with the answer.\par
\par
    'Things don't always happen the way you'd expect in celestial mechanics. \par
Anything thrown off Halley at a reasonable speed will still be moving in \par
essentially the same orbit - it takes a huge velocity change to make a big \par
differenc. So one revolution later, the two orbits will intersect again - and \par
you'll be right back where you started. Seventy-six years older, of course.'\par
\par
    Not far from Old Faithful was another phenomenon which no-one could \par
reasonably have anticipated. When they first observed it, the scientists could \par
scarcely believe their eyes. Spread out across several hectares of Halley, \par
exposed to the vacuum of space, was what appeared to be a perfectly ordinary \par
lake, remarkable only for its extreme blackness.\par
\par
    Obviously, it could not be water; the only liquids which could be stable in \par
this environment were heavy organic oils or tars. In fact, 'Lake Tuonela' turned \par
out to be more like pitch, quite solid except for a sticky surface layer less \par
than a millimetre thick. In this negligible gravity, it must have taken years - \par
perhaps several trips round the warming fires of the Sun - for it to have \par
assumed its present mirror-flatness.\par
\par
    Until the Captain put a stop to it, the lake became one of the principal \par
tourist attractions on Halley's Comet. Someone (nobody claimed the dubious \par
honour) discovered that it was possible to walk perfectly normally across it, \par
almost as if on Earth; the surface film had just enough adhesion to hold the \par
foot in place. Before long, most of the crew had got themselves videoed \par
apparently walking on water...\par
\par
    Then Captain Smith inspected the airlock, discovered the walls liberally \par
stained with tar, and gave the nearest thing to a display of anger that anyone \par
had ever witnessed from him.\par
\par
    'It's bad enough,' he said through clenched teeth, 'having the outside of \par
the ship coated with - soot. Halley's Comet is about the filthiest place I've \par
ever seen...'\par
\par
    After that, there were no more strolls on Lake Tuonela.\par
\par
\par
\par
    19\par
    At the End of the Tunnel\par
\par
\par
\par
    In a small, self-contained universe where everyone knows everyone else, \par
there can be no greater shock than encountering a total stranger.\par
\par
    Heywood Floyd was floating gently along the corridor to the main lounge when \par
he had this disturbing experience. He stared in amazement at the interloper, \par
wondering how a stowaway had managed to avoid detection for so long. The other \par
man looked back at him with a combination of embarrassment and bravado, \par
obviously waiting for Floyd to speak first.\par
\par
    'Well, Victor!' he said at last. 'Sorry I didn't recognize you. So you've \par
made the supreme sacrifice, for the cause of science - or should I say your \par
public?'\par
\par
    'Yes,' Willis answered grumpily. 'I did manage to squeeze into one helmet - \par
but the damn bristles made so many scratching noises no-one could hear a word I \par
said.'\par
\par
    'When are you going out?'\par
\par
    'Just as soon as Cliff comes back - he's gone caving with Bill Chant.'\par
\par
\par
\par
    The first flybys of the comet, in 1986, had suggested that it was \par
considerably less dense than water -which could only mean that it was either \par
made of very porous material, or was riddled with cavities. Both explanations \par
turned out to be correct.\par
\par
    At first, the ever-cautious Captain Smith flatly forbade any cave-exploring. \par
He finally relented when Dr Pendrill reminded him that his chief assistant Dr \par
Chant was an experienced speleologist - indeed, that was one of the very reasons \par
he had been chosen for the mission.\par
\par
    'Cave-ins are impossible, in this low gravity,' Pendrill had told the \par
reluctant Captain. 'So there's no danger of being trapped.'\par
\par
    'What about being lost?'\par
\par
    'Chant would regard that suggestion as a professional insult. He's been \par
twenty kilometres inside Mammoth Cave. Anyway, he'll play out a guideline.'\par
\par
    'Communications?'\par
\par
    'The line's got fibre optics in it. And his suit radio will probably work \par
most of the way.'\par
\par
    'Umm. Where does he want to go in?'\par
\par
    'The best place is that extinct geyser at the base of Etna Junior. It's been \par
dead for at least a thousand years.'\par
\par
    'So I suppose it should keep quiet for another couple of days. Very well - \par
does anyone else want to go?'\par
\par
    'Cliff Greenburg has volunteered - he's done a good deal of underwater cave-\par
exploring, in the Bahamas.'\par
\par
    'I tried it once - that was enough. Tell Cliff he's much too valuable. He \par
can go in as far as he can still see the entrance - and no further. And if he \par
loses contact with Chant, he's not to go after him, without my authority.'\par
\par
    Which, the Captain added to himself, I would be very reluctant to give...\par
\par
\par
\par
    Dr Chant knew all the old jokes about speleologists wanting to return to the \par
womb, and was quite sure he could refute them.\par
\par
    'That must be a damn noisy place, with all its thumpings and bumpings and \par
gurglings,' he argued. 'I love caves because they're so peaceful and timeless. \par
You know that nothing has changed for a hundred thousand years, except that the \par
stalactites have grown a bit thicker.'\par
\par
    But now, as he drifted deeper into Halley, playing out the thin, but \par
virtually unbreakable thread that linked him to Clifford Greenburg, he realized \par
that this was no longer true. As yet, he had no scientific proof, but his \par
geologist's instincts told him that this subterranean world had been born only \par
yesterday, on the time-scale of the Universe. It was younger than some of the \par
cities of man.\par
\par
    The tunnel through which he was gliding in long, shallow leaps was about \par
four metres in diameter, and his virtual weightlessness brought back vivid \par
memories of cave-diving on Earth. The low gravity contributed to the illusion; \par
it was exactly as if he was carrying slightly too much weight, and so kept \par
drifting gently downwards. Only the absence of all resistance reminded him that \par
he was moving through vacuum, not water.\par
\par
    'You're just getting out of sight,' said Greenburg, fifty metres in from the \par
entrance. 'Radio link still fine. What's the scenery like?'\par
\par
    'Very hard to say - I can't identify any formations, so I don't have the \par
vocabulary to describe them. It's not any kind of rock - it crumbles when I \par
touch it - I feel as if I'm exploring a giant Gruy\'e8re cheese.'\par
\par
    'You mean it's organic?'\par
\par
    'Yes - nothing to do with life, of course - but perfect raw material for it. \par
All sorts of hydrocarbons - the chemists will have fun with these samples. Can \par
you still see me?'\par
\par
    'Only the glow of your light, and that's fading fast.'\par
\par
    'Ah - here's some genuine rock - doesn't look as if it belongs here - \par
probably an intrusion - ah - I've struck gold!'\par
\par
    'You're joking!'\par
\par
    'It fooled a lot of people in the old West - iron pyrites. Common on the \par
outer satellites, of course, but don't ask me what it's doing here...'\par
\par
    'Visual contact lost. You're two hundred metres in.'\par
\par
    'I'm passing through a distinct layer - looks like meteoric debris - \par
something exciting must have happened back then - I hope we can date it - wow!'\par
\par
    'Don't do that sort of thing to me!'\par
\par
    'Sorry - quite took my breath away - there's a big chamber ahead - last \par
thing I expected - let me swing the beam around...\par
\par
    'Almost spherical - thirty, forty metres across. And - I don't believe it - \par
Halley is full of surprises - stalactites, stalagmites.'\par
\par
    'What's so surprising about that?'\par
\par
    'No free water, no limestone here, of course - and such low gravity. Looks \par
like some kind of wax. Just a minute while I get good video coverage... \par
fantastic shapes... sort of thing a dripping candle makes... that's odd...'\par
\par
    'Now what?'\par
\par
    Dr Chant's voice had shown a sudden alteration in tone, which Greenburg had \par
instantly detected.\par
\par
    'Some of the columns have been broken. They're lying on the floor. It's \par
almost as if...'\par
\par
    'Go on!'\par
\par
    '... as if something has - blundered - into them.'\par
\par
    'That's crazy. Could an earthquake have snapped them?'\par
\par
    'No earthquakes here - only microseisms from the geysers. Perhaps there was \par
a big blow-out at some time. Anyway, it was centuries ago. There's a film of \par
this wax stuff over the fallen columns - several millimetres thick.'\par
\par
    Dr Chant was slowly recovering his composure. He was not a highly \par
imaginative man - spelunking eliminates such men rather quickly - but the very \par
feel of the place had triggered some disturbing memory. And those fallen columns \par
looked altogether too much like the bars of a cage, broken by some monster in an \par
attempt to escape.\par
\par
    Of course, that was perfectly absurd - but Dr Chant had learned never to \par
ignore any premonition, any danger signal, until he had traced it to its origin. \par
That caution had saved his life more than once; he would not go beyond this \par
chamber until he had identified the source of his fear. And he was honest enough \par
to admit that 'fear' was the correct word.\par
\par
    'Bill - are you all right? What's happening?'\par
\par
    'Still filming. Some of these shapes remind me of Indian temple sculpture. \par
Almost erotic.'\par
\par
    He was deliberately turning his mind away from the direct confrontation of \par
his fears, hoping thereby to sneak up on them unawares, by a kind of averted \par
mental vision. Meanwhile the purely mechanical acts of recording and collecting \par
samples occupied most of his attention.\par
\par
    There was nothing wrong, he reminded himself, with healthy fear; only when \par
it escalated into panic did it become a killer. He had known panic twice in his \par
life (once on a mountainside, once underwater) and still shuddered at the memory \par
of its clammy touch. Yet - thankfully - he was far from it now, and for a reason \par
which, though he did not understand it, he found curiously reassuring. There was \par
an element of comedy in the situation.\par
\par
    And presently he started to laugh - not with hysteria, but with relief.\par
\par
    'Did you ever see those old Star Wars movies?' he asked Greenburg.\par
\par
    'Of course - half a dozen times.'\par
\par
    'Well, I know what's been bothering me. There was a sequence when Luke's \par
spaceship dives into an asteroid - and runs into a gigantic snake-creature that \par
lurks inside its caverns.'\par
\par
    'Not Luke's ship - Hans Solo's Millennium Falcon. And I always wondered how \par
that poor beast managed to eke out a living. It must have grown very hungry, \par
waiting for the occasional titbit from space. And Princess Leia wouldn't have \par
been more than an hors-d'oeuvre, anyway.'\par
\par
    'Which I certainly don't intend to provide,' said Dr Chant, now completely \par
at ease. 'Even if there is life here - which would be marvellous - the food \par
chain would be very short. So I'd be surprised to find anything bigger than a \par
mouse. Or, more likely, a mushroom... Now let's see - where do we go from \par
here... There are two exits on the other side of the chamber... the one on the \par
right is bigger... I'll take that...'\par
\par
    'How much more line have you got?'\par
\par
    'Oh, a good half-kilometre. Here we go... I'm in the middle of the \par
chamber... damn, bounced off the wall... now I've got a hand-hold... going in \par
head-first... smooth walls, real rock for a change... that's a pity..\par
\par
    'What's the problem?'\par
\par
    'Can't go any further. More stalactites... too close together for me to get \par
through... and too thick to break without explosives. And that would be a \par
shame... the colours are beautiful... first real greens and blues I've seen on \par
Halley. Just a minute while I get them on video...\par
\par
    Dr Chant braced himself against the wall of the narrow tunnel, and aimed the \par
camera. With his gloved fingers be reached for the HI-INTENSITY switch, but \par
missed it and cut off the main lights completely.\par
\par
    'Lousy design,' he muttered. 'Third time I've done that.'\par
\par
    He did not immediately correct his mistake, because he had always enjoyed \par
that silence and total darkness which can be experienced only in the deepest \par
caves. The gentle background noises of his life-support equipment robbed him of \par
the silence, but at least...\par
\par
    What was that? From beyond the portcullis of stalactites blocking further \par
progress he could see a faint glow, like the first light of dawn. As his eyes \par
grew adapted to the darkness, it appeared to grow brighter, and he could detect \par
a hint of green. Now he could even see the outlines of the barrier ahead.\par
\par
    'What's happening?' said Greenburg anxiously.\par
\par
    'Nothing - just observing.'\par
\par
    And thinking, he might have added. There were four possible explanations.\par
\par
    Sunlight could be filtering down through some natural light duct - ice, \par
crystal, whatever. But at this depth? Unlikely.\par
\par
    Radioactivity? He hadn't bothered to bring a counter; there were virtually \par
no heavy elements here. But it would be worth coming back to check.\par
\par
    Some phosphorescent mineral - that was the one he'd put his money on. But \par
there was a fourth possibility - the most unlikely, and most exciting, of all.\par
\par
    Dr Chant had never forgotten a moonless - and Luciferless - night on the \par
shores of the Indian Ocean, when he had been walking beneath brilliant stars \par
along a sandy beach. The sea was very calm, but from time to time a languid wave \par
would collapse at his feet - and detonate in an explosion of light.\par
\par
    He had walked out into the shallows (he could still remember the feel of the \par
water round his ankles, like a warm bath) and with every step he took there had \par
been another burst of light. He could even trigger it by clapping his hands \par
close to the surface.\par
\par
    Could similar bioluminescent organisms have evolved, here in the heart of \par
Halley's Comet? He would love to think so. It seemed a pity to vandalize \par
something so exquisite as this natural work of art - with the glow behind it, \par
the barrier now reminded him of an altar screen he had once seen in some \par
cathedral - but he would have to go back and get some explosives. Meanwhile, \par
there was the other corridor...\par
\par
    'I can't get any further along this route,' he told Greenburg, 'so I'll try \par
the other. Coming back to the junction - setting the reel on rewind.' He did not \par
mention the mysterious glow, which had vanished as soon as he switched on his \par
lights again.\par
\par
    Greenburg did not reply immediately, which was unusual; probably he was \par
talking to the ship. Chant did not worry; he would repeat his message as soon as \par
he had got under way again.\par
\par
    He did not bother, because there was a brief acknowledgement from Greenburg.\par
\par
    'Fine, Cliff - thought I'd lost you for a minute. Back at the chamber - now \par
going into the other tunnel - hope there's nothing blocking that.'\par
\par
    This time, Greenburg replied at once.\par
\par
    'Sorry, Bill. Come back to the ship. There's an emergency - no, not here - \par
everything's fine with Universe. But we may have to return to Earth at once.'\par
\par
\par
\par
    It was only a few weeks before Dr Chant discovered a very plausible \par
explanation for the broken columns. As the comet blasted its substance away into \par
space at each perihelion passage, its mass distribution continually altered. And \par
so, every few thousand years, its spin became unstable, and it would change the \par
direction of its axis - quite violently, like a top that is about to fall over \par
as it loses energy. When that occurred, the resulting cometquake could reach a \par
respectable five on the Richter scale.\par
\par
    But he never solved the mystery of the luminous glow. Though the problem was \par
swiftly overshadowed by the drama that was now unfolding, the sense of a missed \par
opportunity would continue to haunt him for the rest of his life.\par
\par
    Though he was occasionally tempted, he never mentioned it to any of his \par
colleagues. But he did leave a sealed note for the next expedition, to be opened \par
in 2133.\par

\par
\par
\par
    'Have you seen Victor?' said Mihailovich gleefully, as Floyd hurried to \par
answer the Captain's summons. 'He's a broken man.'\par
\par
    'He'll grow it back on the way home,' snapped Floyd, who had no time for \par
such trivialities at the moment. 'I'm trying to find out what's happened.'\par
\par
    Captain Smith was still sitting, almost stunned, in his cabin when he \par
arrived. If this was an emergency affecting his own ship, he would have been a \par
tornado of controlled energy, issuing orders right and left. But there was \par
nothing he could do about this situation, except await the next message from \par
Earth.\par
\par
    Captain Laplace was an old friend; how could he have got into such a mess? \par
There was no conceivable accident, error of navigation, or failure of equipment \par
that could possibly account for his predicament. Nor, as far as Smith could see, \par
was there any way in which Universe could help him get out of it. Operations \par
Centre was just running round and round in circles; this looked like one of \par
those emergencies, all too common in space, where nothing could be done except \par
transmit condolences and record last messages. But he gave no hint of his doubts \par
and reservations when he reported the news to Floyd.\par
\par
    'There's been an accident,' he said. 'We've received orders to return to \par
Earth immediately, to be fitted out for a rescue mission.'\par
\par
    'What kind of accident?'\par
\par
    'It's our sister ship, Galaxy. She was doing a survey of the Jovian \par
satellites. And she's made a crash landing.'\par
\par
    He saw the look of amazed incredulity on Floyd's face.\par
\par
    'Yes, I know that's impossible. But you've not heard anything yet. She's \par
stranded - on Europa.'\par
\par
    'Europa!'\par
\par
    'I'm afraid so. She's damaged, but apparently there's no loss of life. We're \par
still awaiting details.'\par
\par
    'When did it happen?'\par
\par
    'Twelve hours ago. There was a delay before she could report to Ganymede.'\par
\par
    'But what can we do? We're on the other side of the Solar System. Getting \par
back to lunar orbit to refuel, then taking the fastest orbit to Jupiter - it \par
would be - oh, at least a couple of months!' (And back in Leonov's day, Floyd \par
added to himself, it would have been a couple of years...)\par
\par
    'I know; but there's no other ship that could do anything.' -\par
\par
    'What about Ganymede's own inter-satellite ferries?'\par
\par
    'They're only designed for orbital operations.'\par
\par
    'They've landed on Callisto.'\par
\par
    'Much lower energy mission. Oh, they could just manage Europa, but with \par
negligible payload. It's being looked into, of course.'\par
\par
    Floyd scarcely heard the Captain; he was still trying to assimilate this \par
astonishing news. For the first time in half a century - and only for the second \par
time in all history! - a ship had landed on the forbidden moon. And that \par
prompted an ominous thought.\par
\par
    'Do you suppose,' he asked, 'that - whoever - whatever - is on Europa could \par
be responsible?'\par
\par
    'I was wondering about that,' said the Captain glumly. 'But we've been \par
snooping around the place for years, without anything happening.'\par
\par
    'Even more to the point - what might happen to us if we attempted a rescue?'\par
\par
    'That's the first thing that occurred to me. But all this is speculation - \par
we'll have to wait until we have more facts. Meanwhile - this is really why I \par
called you - I've just received Galaxy's crew manifest, and I was wondering...'\par
\par
    Hesitantly, he pushed the print-out across his desk. But even before Heywood \par
Floyd scanned the list, he somehow knew what he would find.\par
\par
    'My grandson,' he said bleakly.\par
\par
    And, he added to himself, the only person who can carry my name beyond the \par
grave.\par

    The Politics of Exile\par
\par
\par
\par
    Despite all the gloomier forecasts, the South African Revolution had been \par
comparatively bloodless - as such things go. Television, which had been blamed \par
for many evils, deserved some credit for this. A precedent had been set a \par
generation earlier in the Philippines; when they know that the world is \par
watching, the great majority of men and women tend to behave in a responsible \par
manner. Though there have been shameful exceptions, few massacres occur on \par
camera.\par
\par
    Most of the Afrikaners, when they recognized the inevitable, had left the \par
country long before the takeover of power. And - as the new administration \par
bitterly complained - they had not gone empty-handed. Billions of rands had been \par
transferred to Swiss and Dutch banks; towards the end, there had been mysterious \par
flights almost every hour out of Cape Town and Jo'burg to Zurich and Amsterdam. \par
It was said that by Freedom Day one would not find one troy ounce of gold or a \par
carat of diamond in the late Republic of South Africa - and the mine workings \par
had been effectively sabotaged. One prominent refugee boasted, from his luxury \par
apartment in The Hague, 'It will be five years before the Kaffirs can get \par
Kimberley working again - if they ever do.' To his great surprise, De Beers was \par
back in business, under new name and management, in less than five weeks, and \par
diamonds were now the single most important element in the new nation's economy.\par
\par
    Within a generation, the younger refugees had been absorbed - despite \par
desperate rearguard actions by their conservative elders - in the deracinated \par
culture of the twenty-first century. They recalled, with pride but without \par
boastfulness, the courage and determination of their ancestors, and distanced \par
themselves from their stupidities. Virtually none of them spoke Afrikaans, even \par
in their own homes.\par
\par
    Yet, precisely as in the case of the Russian Revolution a century earlier, \par
there were many who dreamed of putting back the clock - or, at least, of \par
sabotaging the efforts of those who had usurped their power and privilege. \par
Usually they channelled their frustration and bitterness into propaganda, \par
demonstrations, boycotts, petitions to the World Council - and, rarely, works of \par
art. Wilhelm Smuts' The Voortrekkers was conceded to be a masterpiece of \par
(ironically) English literature, even by those who bitterly disagreed with the \par
author.\par
\par
    But there were also groups who believed that political action was useless, \par
and that only violence would restore the longed-for status quo. Although there \par
could not have been many who really imagined that they could rewrite the pages \par
of history, there were not a few who, if victory was impossible, would gladly \par
settle for revenge.\par
\par
    Between the two extremes of the totally assimilated and the completely \par
intransigent, there was an entire spectrum of political - and apolitical - \par
parties. Der Bund was not the largest, but it was the most powerful, and \par
certainly the richest, since it controlled much of the lost Republic's smuggled \par
wealth, through a network of corporations and holding companies. Most of these \par
were now perfectly legal, and indeed completely respectable.\par
\par
    There was half a billion of Bund money in Tsung Aerospace, duly listed in \par
the annual balance sheet. In 2059, Sir Lawrence was happy to receive another \par
half-billion, which enabled him to accelerate the commissioning of his little \par
fleet.\par
\par
    But not even his excellent intelligence traced any connection between the \par
Bund and Tsung Aerospace's latest charter mission, In any event, Halley was then \par
approaching Mars, and Sir Lawrence was so busy getting Universe ready to leave \par
on schedule that he paid little attention to the routine operations of her \par
sister ships.\par
\par
    Though Lloyd's of London did raise some queries about Galaxy's proposed \par
routing, these objections were quickly dealt with. The Bund had people in key \par
positions everywhere; which was unfortunate for the insurance brokers, but very \par
good luck for the space lawyers.\par
\par
\par
\par
    22\par
    Hazardous Cargo\par
\par
\par
\par
    It is not easy to run a shipping line between destinations which not only \par
change their positions by millions of kilometres every few days, but also swing \par
through a velocity range of tens of kilometres a second. Anything like a regular \par
schedule is out of the question; there are times when one must forget the whole \par
idea and stay in port - or at least in orbit - waiting for the Solar System to \par
rearrange itself for the greater convenience of mankind.\par
\par
    Fortunately, these periods are known years in advance, so it is possible to \par
make the best use of them for overhauls, retrofits, and planet leave for the \par
crew. And occasionally, by good luck and aggressive salesmanship, one can \par
arrange some local chartering, even if only the equivalent of the old-time 'Once \par
around the Bay' boat-ride.\par
\par
    Captain Eric Laplace was delighted that the three-month stayover off \par
Ganymede would not be a complete loss. An anonymous and unexpected grant to the \par
Planetary Science Foundation would finance a reconnaissance of the Jovian (even \par
now, no-one ever called it Luciferian) satellite system, paying particular \par
attention to a dozen of the neglected smaller moons. Some of these had never \par
even been properly surveyed, much less visited.\par
\par
    As soon as he heard of the mission, Rolf van der Berg called the Tsung \par
shipping agent and made some discreet enquiries.\par
\par
    'Yes, first we'll head in towards Io - then do a flyby of Europa -'\par
\par
    'Only a flyby? How close?'\par
\par
    'Just a moment - odd, the flight plan doesn't give details. But of course \par
she won't go inside the Interdiction Zone.'\par
\par
    'Which was down to ten thousand kilometres at the last ruling... fifteen \par
years ago. Anyway, I'd like to volunteer as Mission Planetologist. I'll send \par
across my qualifications -'\par
\par
    'No need to do so, Dr van der Berg. They've already asked for you.'\par
\par
\par
\par
    It is always easy to be wise after the event, and when he cast his mind back \par
(he had plenty of time for it later) Captain Laplace recalled a number of \par
curious aspects of the charter. Two crew members were taken suddenly sick, and \par
were replaced at short notice; he was so glad to have substitutes that he did \par
not check their papers as closely as he might have done. (And even if he had, he \par
would have discovered that they were perfectly in order.)\par
\par
    Then there was the trouble with the cargo. As captain, he was entitled to \par
inspect anything that went aboard the ship. Of course, it was impossible to do \par
this for every item, but he never hesitated to investigate if he had good \par
reason. Space crews were, on the whole, a highly responsible body of men; but \par
long missions could be boring, and there were tedium-relieving chemicals which - \par
though perfectly legal on Earth - should be discouraged off it.\par
\par
    When Second Officer Chris Floyd reported his suspicions, the Captain assumed \par
that the ship's chromatographic 'sniffer' had detected another cache of the \par
high-grade opium which his largely Chinese crew occasionally patronized. This \par
time, however, the matter was serious - very serious.\par
\par
    'Cargo Hold Three, Item 2/456, Captain. The manifest says "Scientific \par
apparatus". It contains explosives.'\par
\par
    'What!'\par
\par
    'Definitely, Sir. Here's the electrogram.'\par
\par
    'I'll take your word for it, Mr Floyd. Have you inspected the item?'\par
\par
    'No, Sir. It's in a sealed crew case, half a metre by one metre by five \par
metres, approximately. One of the largest packages the science team brought \par
aboard. It's labelled FRAGILE - HANDLE WITH CARE. But so is everything, of \par
course.'\par
\par
    Captain Laplace drummed his fingers thoughtfully on the grained plastic \par
'wood' of his desk. (He hated the pattern, and intended to get rid of it on the \par
next refit.) Even that slight action started him rising out of his seat, and he \par
automatically anchored himself by wrapping his foot around the pillar of the \par
chair.\par
\par
    Though he did not for a moment doubt Floyd's report - his new Second Officer \par
was very competent, and the Captain was pleased that he had never brought up the \par
subject of his famous grandfather -there could be an innocent explanation. The \par
sniffer might have been misled by other chemicals with nervous molecular \par
bondings.\par
\par
    They could go down into the hold and force open the package. No - that might \par
be dangerous, and could cause legal problems as well. Best to go straight to the \par
top; he'd have to do that anyway, sooner or later.\par
\par
    'Please bring Dr Anderson here - and don't mention this to anyone else,'\par
\par
    'Very good, Sir.' Chris Floyd gave a respectful but quite unnecessary \par
salute, and left the room in a smooth, effortless glide.\par
\par
    The leader of the science team was not accustomed to zero gravity, and his \par
entrance was quite clumsy. His obvious genuine indignation did not help, and he \par
had to grab the Captain's desk several times in an undignified manner.\par
\par
    'Explosives! Of course not! Let me see the manifest... 2/456...'\par
\par
    Dr Anderson pecked out the reference on his portable keyboard, and slowly \par
read off: "Mark V penetrometers, Quantity three." Of course - no problem.'\par
\par
    'And just what,' said the Captain, 'is a penetrometer?' Despite his concern, \par
he had difficulty in suppressing a smile; it sounded a little obscene.\par
\par
    'Standard planetary sampling device. You drop it, and with any luck it will \par
give you a core up to ten metres long - even in hard rock. Then it sends back a \par
complete chemical analysis. The only safe way to study places like dayside \par
Mercury - or Io, where we'll drop the first one.'\par
\par
    'Dr Anderson,' said the Captain, with great selfrestraint, 'you may be an \par
excellent geologist, but you don't know much about celestial mechanics. You \par
can't just drop things from orbit -'\par
\par
    The charge of ignorance was clearly unfounded, as the scientist's reaction \par
proved.\par
\par
    'The idiots!' he said. 'Of course, you should have been notified.'\par
\par
    'Exactly. Solid fuel rockets are classified as "Hazardous Cargo". I want \par
clearance from the underwriters, and your personal assurance that the safety \par
systems are adequate; otherwise, they go overboard. Now, any other little \par
surprises? Were you planning seismic surveys? I believe those usually involve \par
explosives...'\par
\par
    A few hours later, the somewhat chastened scientist admitted that he had \par
also found two bottles of elemental fluorine, used to power the lasers which \par
could zap passing celestial bodies at thousand-kilometre ranges for \par
spectrographic sampling. As pure fluorine was about the most vicious substance \par
known to man, it was high on the list of prohibited materials - but, like the \par
rockets which drove the penetrometers down to their targets, it was essential \par
for the mission.\par
\par
    When he was quite satisfied that all the necessary precautions had been \par
taken, Captain Laplace accepted the scientist's apologies, and his assurance \par
that the oversight was entirely due to the haste with which the expedition had \par
been organized.\par
\par
    He felt sure that Dr Anderson was telling the truth, but already he felt \par
that there was something odd about the mission.\par
\par
    Just how odd he could never have imagined.\par
\par
\par
\par
    23\par
    Inferno\par
\par
\par
\par
    Before the detonation of Jupiter, Io had been second only to Venus as the \par
best approximation to Hell in the Solar System. Now that Lucifer had raised its \par
surface temperature another couple of hundred degrees, even Venus could no \par
longer compete.\par
\par
    The sulphur volcanoes and geysers had multiplied their activity, now \par
reshaping the features of the tormented satellite in years rather than decades. \par
The planetologists had given up any attempt at mapmaking, and contented \par
themselves with taking orbital photographs every few days. From these, they had \par
constructed awe-inspiring time-lapse movies of inferno in action.\par
\par
    Lloyd's of London had charged a stiff premium for this leg of the mission, \par
but Io posed no real danger to a ship doing a flyby at a minimum range of ten \par
thousand kilometres - and over the relatively quiescent nightside at that.\par
\par
    As he watched the approaching yellow and orange globe - the most improbably \par
garish object in the entire Solar System - Second Officer Chris Floyd could not \par
help recalling the time, now half a century ago, when his grandfather had come \par
this way. Here, Leonov had made its rendezvous with the abandoned Discovery, and \par
here Dr Chandra had reawakened the dormant computer Hal. Then both ships had \par
flown on to survey the enormous black monolith hovering at L1, the Inner \par
Lagrange Point between Io and Jupiter.\par
\par
    Now the monolith was gone - and so was Jupiter. The minisun that had risen \par
like a phoenix from the implosion of the giant planet had turned its satellites \par
into what was virtually another Solar System, though only on Ganymede and Europa \par
were there regions with Earthlike temperatures. How long that would continue to \par
be the case, no-one knew. Estimates of Lucifer's life-span ranged from a \par
thousand to a million years.\par
\par
    Galaxy's science team looked wistfully at the L1 point, but it was now far \par
too dangerous to approach. There had always been a river of electrical energy - \par
the Io 'flux tube' - flowing between Jupiter and its inner satellite, and the \par
creation of Lucifer had increased its strength several hundredfold. Sometimes \par
the river of power could even be seen by the naked eye, glowing yellow with the \par
characteristic light of ionized sodium. Some engineers on Ganymede had talked \par
hopefully about tapping the gigawatts going to waste next door, but no-one could \par
think of a plausible way of doing so.\par
\par
    The first penetrometer was launched, with vulgar comments from the crew, and \par
two hours later drove like a hypodermic needle into the festering satellite. It \par
continued to operate for almost five seconds - ten times its designed lifetime - \par
broadcasting thousands of chemical, physical and rheological measurements, \par
before Io demolished it.\par
\par
    The scientists were ecstatic; van der Berg was merely pleased. He had \par
expected the probe to work; Io was an absurdly easy target. But if he was right \par
about Europa, the second penetrometer would surely fail.\par
\par
    Yet that would prove nothing; it might fail for a dozen good reasons. And \par
when it did, there would be no alternative but a landing.\par
\par
    Which, of course, was totally prohibited - not only by the laws of man.\par
\par
\par
\par
    24\par
    Shaka the Great\par
\par
\par
\par
    ASTROPOL - which, despite its grandiose title, had disappointingly little \par
business off Earth - would not admit that SHAKA really existed. The USSA took \par
exactly the same position, and its diplomats became embarrassed or indignant \par
when anyone was tactless enough to mention the name.\par
\par
    But Newton's Third Law applies in politics, as in everything else. The Bund \par
had its extremists -though it tried, sometimes not very hard, to disown them - \par
continually plotting against the USSA. Usually they confined themselves to \par
attempts at commercial sabotage, but there were occasional explosions, \par
disappearances and even assassinations.\par
\par
    Needless to say, the South Africans did not take this lightly. They reacted \par
by establishing their own official counter-intelligence services, which also had \par
a rather free-wheeling range of operations - and likewise claimed to know \par
nothing about SHAKA. Perhaps they were employing the useful CIA invention of \par
'plausible deniability'. It is even possible that they were telling the truth.\par
\par
    According to one theory, SHAKA started as a codeword, and then - rather like \par
Prokofiev's 'Lieutenant Kije' - had acquired a life of its own, because it was \par
useful to various clandestine bureaucracies. This would certainly account for \par
the fact that none of its members had ever defected, or even been arrested.\par
\par
    But there was another, somewhat far-fetched explanation for this, according \par
to those who believed that SHAKA really did exist. All its agents had been \par
psychologically conditioned to self-destruct before there was any possibility of \par
interrogation.\par
\par
    Whatever the truth, no-one could seriously imagine that, more than two \par
centuries after his death, the legend of the great Zulu tyrant would cast its \par
shadow across worlds he never knew.\par
\par
\par
\par
    25\par
    The Shrouded World\par
\par
\par
\par
    During the decade after the ignition of Jupiter, and the spreading of the \par
Great Thaw across its satellite system, Europa had been left strictly alone. \par
Then the Chinese had made a swift flyby, probing the clouds with radar in an \par
attempt to locate the wreck of the Tsien. They had been unsuccessful, but their \par
maps of dayside were the first to show the new continents now emerging as the \par
ice-cover melted.\par
\par
    They had also discovered a perfectly straight two-kilometre-long feature \par
which looked so artificial that it was christened the Great Wall. Because of its \par
shape and size it was assumed to be the Monolith -or a monolith, since millions \par
had been replicated in the hours before the creation of Lucifer.\par
\par
    However, there had been no reaction, or any hint of an intelligent signal, \par
from below the steadily thickening clouds. So a few years later, survey \par
satellites were placed in permanent orbit, and high-altitude balloons were \par
dropped into the atmosphere to study its wind patterns. Terrestrial \par
meteorologists found these of absorbing interest, because Europa - with a \par
central ocean, and a sun that never set - presented a beautifully simplified \par
model for their text-books.\par
\par
    So had begun the game of 'Europan Roulette', as the administrators were fond \par
of calling it whenever the scientists proposed getting closer to the satellite.\par
\par
    After fifty uneventful years, it had become somewhat boring. Captain Laplace \par
hoped it would remain that way, and had required considerable reassurance from \par
Dr Anderson.\par
\par
    'Personally,' he had told the scientist, 'I would regard it as a slightly \par
unfriendly act, to have a ton of armour-piercing hardware dropped on me at a \par
thousand kilometres an hour. I'm quite surprised the World Council gave you \par
permission.'\par
\par
    Dr Anderson was also a little surprised, though he might not have been had \par
he known that the project was the last item on a long agenda of a Science \par
SubCommittee late on a Friday afternoon. Of such trifles history is made.\par
\par
    'I agree, Captain. But we are operating under very strict limitations, and \par
there's no possibility of interfering with the - ah - Europans, whoever they \par
are. We're aiming at a target five kilometres above sea level.'\par
\par
    'So I understand. What's so interesting about Mount Zeus?'\par
\par
    'It's a total mystery. It wasn't even there, only a few years ago. So you \par
can understand why it drives the geologists crazy.'\par
\par
    'And your gadget will analyse it when it goes in.'\par
\par
    'Exactly. And - I really shouldn't be telling you this - but I've been asked \par
to keep the results confidential, and to send them back to Earth encrypted. \par
Obviously, someone's on the track of a major discovery, and wants to make quite \par
sure they're not beaten to a publication. Would you believe that scientists \par
could be so petty?'\par
\par
    Captain Laplace could well believe it, but did not want to disillusion his \par
passenger. Dr Anderson seemed touchingly na\'efve; whatever was going on - and the \par
Captain was now quite certain there was much more to this mission than met the \par
eye - Anderson knew nothing about it.\par
\par
    'I can only hope, Doctor, that the Europans don't go in for mountain \par
climbing. I'd hate to interrupt any attempt to put a flag on their local \par
Everest.'\par
\par
\par
\par
    There was a feeling of unusual excitement aboard Galaxy when the \par
penetrometer was launched - and even the inevitable jokes were muted. During the \par
two hours of the probe's long fall towards Europa, virtually every member of the \par
crew found some perfectly legitimate excuse to visit the bridge and watch the \par
guidance operation. Fifteen minutes before impact, Captain Laplace declared it \par
out of bounds to all visitors, except the ship's new steward Rosie; without her \par
endless supply of squeezebulbs full of excellent coffee, the operation could not \par
have continued.\par
\par
    Everything went perfectly. Soon after atmospheric entry, the air-brakes were \par
deployed, slowing the penetrometer to an acceptable impact velocity. The radar \par
image of the target - featureless, with no indication of scale - grew steadily \par
on the screen. At minus one second, all the recorders switched automatically to \par
high speed...\par
\par
    But there was nothing to record. 'Now I know,' said Dr Anderson sadly, 'just \par
how they felt at the Jet Propulsion Lab, when those first Rangers crashed into \par
the Moon - with their cameras blind.'\par
\par
\par
\par

    Night Watch\par
\par
\par
\par
    Only time is universal; night and day are merely quaint local customs, found \par
on those planets which tidal forces have not yet robbed of their rotation. But \par
however far they travel from their native world, human beings can never escape \par
the diurnal rhythm, set ages ago by its cycle of light and darkness.\par
\par
    So at 01.05, Universal Time, Second Officer Chang was alone on the bridge, \par
while the ship was sleeping around him. There was no real need for him to be \par
awake either, since Galaxy's electronic senses would detect any malfunction far \par
sooner than he could possibly do. But a century of cybernetics had proved that \par
human beings were still slightly better than machines at dealing with the \par
unexpected; and sooner or later, the unexpected always happened.\par
\par
    'Where's my coffee?' thought Chang grumpily. 'It's not like Rosie to be \par
late.' He wondered if the steward had been affected by the same malaise that had \par
overtaken both scientists and space crew, after the disasters of the last \par
twenty-four hours.\par
\par
    Following the failure of the first penetrometer, there had been a hasty \par
conference to decide the next step. One unit was left; it had been intended for \par
Callisto, but it could be used just as easily here.\par
\par
    'And anyway,' Dr Anderson had argued, 'we've landed on Callisto - there's \par
nothing there except assorted varieties of cracked ice.'\par
\par
    There had been no disagreement. After a twelve-hour delay for modification \par
and testing, Pen No. 3 was launched into the Europan cloudscape, following the \par
invisible track of its precursor.\par
\par
    This time, the ship's recorders did get some data - for about half a \par
millisecond. The accelerometer on the probe, which was calibrated to operate up \par
to 20,000 gee, gave one brief pulse before going off-scale. Everything must have \par
been destroyed in very much less than the twinkling of an eye.\par
\par
    After a second, and even gloomier, post-mortem, it was decided to report to \par
Earth, and wait in high orbit round Europa for any further instructions, before \par
proceeding to Callisto and the outer moons,\par
\par
    'Sorry to be late, Sir,' said Rose McCullen (one would never guess from her \par
name that she was slightly darker than the coffee she was carrying) 'but I must \par
have set the alarm wrong.'\par
\par
    'Lucky for us,' chuckled the Officer of the Watch, 'that you're not running \par
the ship.'\par
\par
    'I don't understand how anyone could run it,' answered Rose. 'It all looks \par
so complicated.'\par
\par
    'Oh, it's not as bad as it looks,' said Chang. 'And don't they give you \par
basic space theory in your training course?'\par
\par
    'Er - yes. But I never understood much of it. Orbits and all that nonsense.'\par
\par
    Second Officer Chang was bored, and felt it would be a kindness to enlighten \par
his audience. And although Rose was not exactly his type, she was undoubtedly \par
attractive; a little effort now might be a worthwhile investment. It never \par
occurred to him that, having performed her duty, Rose might like to go back to \par
sleep.\par
\par
    Twenty minutes later, Second Officer Chang waved at the navigation console \par
and concluded expansively: 'So you see, it's really almost automatic. You only \par
have to punch in a few numbers and the ship takes care of the rest.'\par
\par
    Rose seemed to be getting tired; she kept looking at her watch.\par
\par
    'I'm sorry,' said the suddenly contrite Chang. 'I shouldn't have kept you \par
up.'\par
\par
    'Oh no - it's extremely interesting. Please go on.'\par
\par
    'Definitely not. Maybe some other time. Goodnight, Rosie - and thanks for \par
the coffee.'\par
\par
    'Goodnight, Sir.'\par
\par
    Steward Third Class Rose McCullen glided (not too skilfully) towards the \par
still open door. Chang did not bother to look back when he heard it close.\par
\par
    It was thus a considerable shock when, a few seconds later, he was addressed \par
by a completely unfamiliar female voice.\par
\par
    'Mr Chang - don't bother to touch the alarm button - it's disconnected. Here \par
are the landing coordinates. Take the ship down.'\par
\par
    Slowly, wondering if he had somehow dozed off and was having a nightmare, \par
Chang rotated his chair.\par
\par
    The person who had been Rose McCullen was floating beside the oval hatchway, \par
steadying herself by holding on to the locking lever of the door. Everything \par
about her seemed to have changed; in a moment of time, their roles had been \par
reversed. The shy steward - who had never before looked at him directly - was \par
now regarding Chang with a cold, merciless stare that made him feel like a \par
rabbit hypnotized by a snake. The small but deadly-looking gun nestling in her \par
free hand seemed an unnecessary adornment; Chang had not the slightest doubt \par
that she could very efficiently kill him without it.\par
\par
    Nevertheless, both his self-respect and his professional honour demanded \par
that he should not surrender without some sort of a struggle. At the very least, \par
he might be able to gain time.\par
\par
    'Rose,' he said - and now his lips had difficulty in forming a name which \par
had become suddenly inappropriate - 'this is perfectly ridiculous. What I told \par
you just now - it's simply not true. I couldn't possibly land the ship by \par
myself. It would take hours to compute the correct orbit, and I'd need someone \par
to help me. A co-pilot, at least.'\par
\par
    The gun did not waver.\par
\par
    'I'm not a fool, Mr Chang. This ship isn't energy-limited, like the old \par
chemical rockets. The escape velocity of Europa is only three kilometres a \par
second. Part of your training is an emergency landing with the main computer \par
down. Now you can put it into practice: the window for an optimum touchdown at \par
the coordinates I will give you opens in five minutes.'\par
\par
    'That type of abort,' said Chang, now beginning to sweat profusely, 'has an \par
estimated twenty-five per cent failure rate' - the true figure was ten per cent, \par
but in the circumstances he felt that a little exaggeration was justified - 'and \par
it's years since I checked out on it.'\par
\par
    'In that case,' answered Rose McCullen, 'I'll have to eliminate you and ask \par
the Captain to send me someone more qualified. Annoying, because we'll miss this \par
window and have to wait a couple of hours for the next one. Four minutes left.'\par
\par
    Second Officer Chang knew when he was beaten; but at least he had tried.\par
\par
    'Let me have those coordinates,' he said.\par
\par
\par
\par
    27\par
    Rosie\par
\par
\par
\par
    Captain Laplace woke instantly at the first gentle tapping, like a distant \par
woodpecker, of the attitude control jets. For a moment he wondered if he was \par
dreaming: no, the ship was definitely turning in space.\par
\par
    Perhaps it was getting too hot on one side and the thermal control system \par
was making some minor adjustments. That did happen occasionally, and was a black \par
mark for the officer on duty, who should have noticed that the temperature \par
envelope was being approached.\par
\par
    He reached for the intercom button to call - who was it? - Mr Chang on the \par
bridge. His hand never completed the movement.\par
\par
    After days of weightlessness, even a tenth of a gravity is a shock. To the \par
Captain it seemed like minutes, though it must have been only a few seconds, \par
before he could unbuckle his restraining harness and struggle out of his bunk. \par
This time, he found the button and jabbed it viciously. There was no reply.\par
\par
    He tried to ignore the thuds and bumps of inadequately secured objects that \par
had been taken unawares by the onset of gravity. Things seemed to go on falling \par
for a long time, but presently the only abnormal sound was the muffled, far-off \par
scream of the drive at full blast.\par
\par
    He tore open the curtain of the cabin's little window, and looked out at the \par
stars. He knew roughly where the ship's axis should have been pointing; even if \par
he could only judge it to within thirty or forty degrees, that would allow him \par
to distinguish between the two possible alternatives.\par
\par
    Galaxy could be vectored either to gain, or to lose, orbital velocity. It \par
was losing it - and therefore preparing to fall towards Europa.\par
\par
    There was an insistent banging on the door, and the Captain realized that \par
little more than a minute could really have passed. Second Officer Floyd and two \par
other crew members were crowded in the narrow passageway.\par
\par
    'The bridge is locked, Sir,' Floyd reported breathlessly. 'We can't get in - \par
and Chang doesn't answer. We don't know what's happened.'\par
\par
    'I'm afraid I do,' Captain Laplace answered, climbing into his shorts. 'Some \par
madman was bound to try it sooner or later. We've been hijacked, and I know \par
where. But I'm damned if I know why.'\par
\par
    He glanced at his watch, and did a quick mental calculation.\par
\par
    'At this thrust level, we'll have deorbited within fifteen minutes - make it \par
ten for safety. Any way we can cut the drive without endangering the ship?'\par
\par
    Second Officer Yu, Engineering, looked very unhappy, but volunteered a \par
reluctant reply.\par
\par
    'We could pull the circuit breakers in the pump motor lines, and cut off the \par
propellant supply.'\par
\par
    'Can we get at them?'\par
\par
    'Yes - they're on Deck Three.'\par
\par
    'Then let's go.'\par
\par
    'Er - then the independent backup system would take over. For safety, that's \par
behind a sealed bulkhead on Deck Five - we'd have to get a cutter - no, it \par
couldn't be done in time.'\par
\par
    Captain Laplace had been afraid of that. The men of genius who had designed \par
Galaxy had tried to protect the ship from all plausible accidents. There was no \par
way they could have safeguarded it against human malevolence.\par
\par
    'Any alternatives?'\par
\par
    'Not in the time available, I'm afraid.'\par
\par
    'Then let's get to the bridge and see if we can talk to Chang - and whoever \par
is with him.'\par
\par
    And who could that be? he wondered. He refused to believe that it could be \par
one of his regular crew. That left - of course, there was the answer! He could \par
see it all. Monomaniac researcher tries to prove theory - experiments frustrated \par
- decides that the quest for knowledge takes precedence over everything else.\par
\par
    It was uncomfortably like one of those cheap 'mad scientist' melodramas, but \par
it fitted the facts perfectly. He wondered if Dr Anderson had decided that this \par
was the only road to a Nobel Prize.\par
\par
    That theory was swiftly demolished when the breathless and dishevelled \par
geologist arrived gasping:\par
\par
    'For God's sake, Captain - what's happening? We're under full thrust! Are we \par
going up - or down?'\par
\par
    'Down,' answered Captain Laplace. 'In about ten minutes, we'll be in an \par
orbit that will hit Europa. I can only hope that whoever's at the controls knows \par
what he's doing.'\par
\par
    Now they were at the bridge, facing the closed door. Not a sound came from \par
the far side.\par
\par
    Laplate rapped as loudly as he possibly could without bruising his knuckles.\par
\par
    'This is the Captain! Let us in!'\par
\par
    He felt rather foolish at giving an order which would certainly be ignored, \par
but he hoped for at least some reaction. To his surprise, he got one.\par
\par
    The external speaker hissed into life, and a voice said: 'Don't attempt \par
anything foolish, Captain. I have a gun, and Mr Chang is obeying my orders.'\par
\par
    'Who was that?' whispered one of the officers. 'It sounds like a woman!'\par
\par
    'You're right,' said the Captain grimly. That certainly cut down the \par
alternatives, but didn't help matters in any way.\par
\par
    'What do you hope to do? You know you can't possibly get away with it!' he \par
shouted, trying to sound masterful rather than plaintive.\par
\par
    'We're landing on Europa. And if you want to take off again, don't try to \par
stop me.'\par
\par
\par
\par
    'Her room's completely clean,' Second Officer Chris Floyd reported thirty \par
minutes later, when the thrust had been cut to zero and Galaxy was falling along \par
the ellipse which would soon graze the atmosphere of Europa. They were now \par
committed; although it would now be possible to immobilize the engines, it would \par
be suicide to do so. They would be needed again to make a landing - although \par
that could be merely a more protracted form of suicide.\par
\par
    'Rosie McCullen! Who would have believed it! Do you suppose she's on drugs?'\par
\par
    'No,' said Floyd. 'This has been very carefully planned. She must have a \par
radio hidden somewhere in the ship. We should search for it.'\par
\par
    'You sound like a damned cop.'\par
\par
    'That will do, gentlemen,' said the Captain. Tempers were getting frayed, \par
largely through sheer frustration and the total failure to establish any further \par
contact with the barricaded bridge. He glanced at his watch.\par
\par
    'Less than two hours before we enter atmosphere - what there is of it. I'll \par
be in my cabin - it's just possible they may try to call me there. Mr Yu, please \par
stand by the bridge and report any developments at once.'\par
\par
    He had never felt so helpless in his life, but there were times when doing \par
nothing was the only thing to do. As he left the officers' wardroom, he heard \par
someone say wistfully: 'I could do with a bulb of coffee. Rosie made the best \par
I've ever tasted.'\par
\par
    Yes, thought the Captain grimly, she's certainly efficient. Whatever job she \par
tackles, she'll do it thoroughly.\par
\par
\par
\par
    28\par
    Dialogue\par
\par
\par
\par
    There was only one man aboard Galaxy who could regard the situation as \par
anything but a total disaster. I may be about to die, Rolf van der Berg told \par
himself; but at least I have a chance of scientific immortality. Though that \par
might be poor consolation, it was more than anyone else on the ship could hope \par
for.\par
\par
    That Galaxy was heading for Mount Zeus he did not doubt for a moment; there \par
was nothing else on Europa of any significance. Indeed, there was nothing \par
remotely comparable on any planet.\par
\par
    So his theory - and he had to admit that it was still a theory - was no \par
longer a secret. How could it have leaked out?\par
\par
    He trusted Uncle Paul implicitly, but he might have been indiscreet. More \par
likely, someone had monitored his computers, perhaps as a matter of routine. If \par
so, the old scientist could well be in danger; Rolf wondered if he could - or \par
should - get a warning to him. He knew that the communications officer was \par
trying to contact Ganymede via one of the emergency transmitters; an automatic \par
beacon alert had already gone out, and the news would be hitting Earth any \par
minute now. It had been on its way now for almost an hour...\par
\par
    'Come in,' he said, at the quiet knock on his cabin door. 'Oh - hello, \par
Chris. What can I do for you?'\par
\par
    He was surprised to see Second Officer Chris Floyd, whom he knew no better \par
than any of his other colleagues. If they landed safely on Europa, he thought \par
gloomily, they might get to know each other far better than they wished.\par
\par
    'Hello, Doctor. You're the only person who lives around here. I wondered if \par
you could help me.'\par
\par
    'I'm not sure how anyone can help anyone at the moment. What's the latest \par
from the bridge?'\par
\par
    'Nothing new: I've just left Yu and Gillings up there, trying to fix a mike \par
on the door. But no-one inside seems to be talking; not surprising - Chang must \par
have his hands full.'\par
\par
    'Can he get us down safely?'\par
\par
    'He's the best; if anyone can do it, he can. I'm more worried about getting \par
off again.'\par
\par
    'God - I'd not been looking that far ahead. I assumed that was no problem.'\par
\par
    'It could be marginal. Remember, this ship is designed for orbital \par
operations. We hadn't planned to put down on any major moon - though we had \par
hoped to rendezvous with Ananke and Carme. So we could be stuck on Europa - \par
especially if Chang has to waste propellant looking for a good landing site.'\par
\par
    'Do we know where he is trying to land?' Rolf asked, trying not to sound \par
more interested than might be reasonably expected. He must have failed, because \par
Chris looked at him sharply.\par
\par
    'There's no way we can tell at this stage, though we may get a better idea \par
when he starts braking. But you know these moons; where do you think?'\par
\par
    'There's only one interesting place. Mount Zeus.'\par
\par
    'Why should anyone want to land there?'\par
\par
    RoIf shrugged.\par
\par
    'That was one of the things we'd hoped to find out. Cost us two expensive \par
penetrometers.'\par
\par
    'And it looks like costing a great deal more. Haven't you any ideas?'\par
\par
    'You sound like a cop,' said van der Berg with a grin, not intending it in \par
the least seriously.\par
\par
    'Funny - that's the second time I've been told that in the last hour.'\par
\par
    Instantly, there was a subtle change in the atmosphere of the cabin - almost \par
as if the life-support system had readjusted itself.\par
\par
    'Oh - I was just joking - are you?'\par
\par
    'If I was, I wouldn't admit it, would I?'\par
\par
    That was no answer, thought van der Berg; but on second thoughts, perhaps it \par
was.\par
\par
    He looked intently at the young officer, noticing - not for the first time - \par
his striking resemblance to his famous grandfather. Someone had mentioned that \par
Chris Floyd had only joined Galaxy on this mission, from another ship in the \par
Tsung fleet - adding sarcastically that it was useful to have good connections \par
in any business. But there had been no criticism of Floyd's ability; he was an \par
excellent space officer. Those skills might qualify him for other part-time jobs \par
as well; look at RosieMcCulIen - who had also, now he came to think of it, \par
joined Galaxy just before this mission.\par
\par
    Rolf van der Berg felt that he had become enmeshed in some vast and tenuous \par
web of interplanetary intrigue; as a scientist, accustomed to getting - usually \par
- straightforward answers to the questions he put to nature, he did not enjoy \par
the situation.\par
\par
    But he could hardly claim to be an innocent victim. He had tried to conceal \par
the truth - or at least what he believed to be the truth. And now the \par
consequences of that deceit had multiplied like the neutrons in a chain \par
reaction; with results that might be equally disastrous.\par
\par
    Which side was Chris Floyd on? How many sides were there? The Bund would \par
certainly be involved, once the secret had leaked out. But there were splinter \par
groups within the Bund itself, and groups opposing them; it was like a hall of \par
mirrors.\par
\par
    There was one point, however, on which he did feel reasonably certain. Chris \par
Floyd, if only because of his connections, could be trusted. I'd put my money, \par
thought van der Berg, on him being assigned to ASTROPOL for the duration of the \par
mission - however long, or short, that might now be.\par
\par
    'I'd like to help you, Chris,' he said slowly. 'As you probably suspect, I \par
do have some theories. But they may still be utter nonsense.\par
\par
    'In less than half an hour, we may know the truth. Until then, I prefer to \par
say nothing.'\par
\par
    And this is not, he told himself, merely ingrained Boer stubbornness. If he \par
had been mistaken, he would prefer not to die among men who knew that he was the \par
fool who had brought them to their doom.\par
\par
\par
\par
    29\par
    Descent\par
\par
\par
\par
    Second Officer Chang had been wrestling with the problem ever since Galaxy \par
had been successfully - to his surprise as much as his relief - injected into \par
transfer orbit. For the next couple of hours she was in the hands of God, or at \par
least Sir Isaac Newton; there was nothing to do but wait until the final braking \par
and descent manoeuvre.\par
\par
    He had briefly considered trying to fool Rosie by giving the ship a reverse \par
vector at closest approach, and so taking it out into space again. It would then \par
be back in a stable orbit, and a rescue could eventually be mounted from \par
Ganymede. But there was a fundamental objection to this scheme: he would \par
certainly not be alive to be rescued. Though Chang was no coward, he would \par
prefer not to become a posthumous hero of the spaceways.\par
\par
    In any event, his chances of surviving the next hour seemed remote. He had \par
been ordered to take down, single-handed, a three-thousand tonner on totally \par
unknown territory. This was not a feat he would care to attempt even on the \par
familiar Moon.\par
\par
    'How many minutes before you start braking?' asked Rosie. Perhaps it was \par
more of an order than a question; she clearly understood the fundamentals of \par
astronautics, and Chang abandoned his last wild fantasies of outwitting her.\par
\par
    'Five,' he said reluctantly. 'Can I warn the rest of the ship to stand by?'\par
\par
    'I'll do it. Give me the mike... THIS IS THE BRIDGE. WE START BRAKING IN \par
FIVE MINUTES. REPEAT, FIVE MINUTES. OUT.'\par
\par
    To the scientists and officers assembled in the wardroom, the message was \par
fully expected. They had had one piece of luck; the external video monitors had \par
not been switched off. Perhaps Rose had forgotten about them; it was more likely \par
that she had not bothered. So now, as helpless spectators - quite literally, a \par
captive audience - they could watch their unfolding doom.\par
\par
    The cloudy crescent of Europa now filled the field of the rear-view camera. \par
There was no break anywhere in the solid overcast of water vapour recondensing \par
on its way back to nightside. That was not important, since the landing would be \par
radar-controlled until the last moment. It would, however, prolong the agony of \par
observers who had to rely on visible light,\par
\par
    No-one stared more intently at the approaching world than the man who had \par
studied it with such frustration for almost a decade. Rolf van der Berg, seated \par
in one of the flimsy low-gravity chairs with the restraining belt lightly \par
fastened, barely noticed the first onset of weight as braking commenced.\par
\par
    In five seconds, they were up to full thrust. All the officers were doing \par
rapid calculations on their comsets; without access to Navigation, there would \par
be a lot of guesswork, and Captain Laplace waited for a consensus to emerge.\par
\par
    'Eleven minutes,' he announced presently, 'assuming he doesn't reduce thrust \par
level - he's at max now. And assuming he's going to hover at ten kilometres - \par
just above the overcast - and then go straight down. That could take another \par
five minutes.'\par
\par
    It was unnecessary for him to add that the last second of those five minutes \par
would be the most critical.\par
\par
    Europa seemed determined to keep its secrets to the very end. When Galaxy \par
was hovering motionless, just above the cloudscape, there was still no sign of \par
the land - or sea - beneath. Then, for a few agonizing seconds, the screens \par
became completely blank - except for a glimpse of the now extended, and very \par
seldom used, landing gear. The noise of its emergence a few minutes earlier had \par
caused a brief flurry of alarm among the passengers; now they could only hope \par
that it would perform its duty.\par
\par
    How thick is this damn cloud? van der Berg asked himself. Does it go all the \par
way down -No, it was breaking, thinning out into shreds and wisps - and there \par
was the new Europa, spread out, it seemed, only a few thousand metres below.\par
\par
    It was indeed new; one did not have to be a geologist to see that. Four \par
billion years ago, perhaps, the infant Earth had looked like this, as land and \par
sea prepared to begin their endless conflict.\par
\par
    Here, until fifty years ago, there had been neither land nor sea - only ice. \par
But now the ice had melted on the Lucifer-facing hemisphere, the resulting water \par
had boiled upwards - and been deposited in the permanent deep-freeze of \par
nightside. The removal of billions of tons of liquid from one hemisphere to the \par
other had thus exposed ancient seabeds that had never before known even the pale \par
light of the far-distant Sun.\par
\par
    Some day, perhaps, these contorted landscapes would be softened and tamed by \par
a spreading blanket of vegetation; now they were barren lava flows and gently \par
steaming mud flats, interrupted occasionally by masses of up-thrust rock with \par
strangely slanting strata. This had clearly been an area of great tectonic \par
disturbance, which was hardly surprising if it had seen the recent birth of a \par
mountain the size of Everest.\par
\par
    And there it was - looming up over the unnaturally close horizon. Rolf van \par
der Berg felt a tightness in his chest, and a tingling of the flesh at the back \par
of his neck. No longer through the remote impersonal senses of instruments, but \par
with his own eyes, he was seeing the mountain of his dreams.\par
\par
    As he well knew, it was in the approximate shape of a tetrahedron, tilted so \par
that one face was almost vertical. (That would be a nice challenge to climbers, \par
even in this gravity - especially as they couldn't drive pitons into it...) The \par
summit was hidden in the clouds, and much of the gently-sloping face turned \par
towards them was covered with snow.\par
\par
    'Is that what all the fuss is about?' muttered someone in disgust. 'Looks \par
like a perfectly ordinary mountain to me. I guess that once you've seen one -' \par
He was 'shushed' angrily into silence.\par
\par
    Galaxy was now drifting slowly towards Mount Zeus, as Chang searched for a \par
good landing place. The ship had very little lateral control, as ninety per cent \par
of the main thrust had to be used merely to support it. There was enough \par
propellant to hover for perhaps five minutes; after that, he might still be able \par
to land safely - but he could never take off again.\par
\par
    Neil Armstrong had faced the same dilemma, almost a hundred years ago. But \par
he had not been piloting with a gun aimed at his head.\par
\par
    Yet for the last few minutes, Chang had totally forgotten both gun and \par
Rosie. Every sense was focused on the job ahead; he was virtually part of the \par
great machine he was controlling. The only human emotion left to him was not \par
fear - but exhilaration. This was the job he had been trained to perform; this \par
was the highlight of his professional career - even as it might be the finale.\par
\par
    And that was what it looked like becoming. The foot of the mountain was now \par
less than a kilometre away - and he had still found no landing site. The terrain \par
was incredibly rugged, torn with canyons, littered with gigantic boulders. He \par
had not seen a single horizontal area larger than a tennis court -and the red \par
line on the propellant gauge was only thirty seconds away.\par
\par
    But there, at last, was a smooth surface - much the flattest he'd seen - it \par
was his only chance within the time frame.\par
\par
    Delicately, he juggled the giant, unstable cylinder he was controlling \par
towards the patch of horizontal ground - it seemed to be snow-covered - yes, it \par
was - the blast was blowing the snow away - but what's underneath? - looks like \par
ice - must be a frozen lake - how thick? - HOW THICK? -The five-hundred-ton \par
hammer-blow of Galaxy's main jets hit the treacherously inviting surface. A \par
pattern of radiating lines sped swiftly across it; the ice cracked, and great \par
sheets started to overturn. Concentric waves of boiling water hurtled outwards \par
as the fury of the drive blasted into the suddenly uncovered lake.\par
\par
    Like the well-trained officer he was, Chang reacted automatically, without \par
the fatal hesitations of thought. His left hand ripped open the SAFETY LOCK bar; \par
his right grabbed the red lever it protected - and pulled it to the open \par
position.\par
\par
    The ABORT program, peacefully sleeping ever since Galaxy was launched, took \par
over and hurled the ship back up into the sky.\par
\par
\par
\par
    30\par
    Galaxy Down\par
\par
\par
\par
    In the wardroom, the sudden surge of full thrust came like a stay of \par
execution. The horrified officers had seen the collapse of the chosen landing \par
site, and knew that there was only one way of escape. Now that Chang had taken \par
it, they once more permitted themselves the luxury of breath.\par
\par
    But how long they could continue to enjoy that experience, no-one could \par
guess. Only Chang knew whether the ship had enough propellant to reach a stable \par
orbit; and even if it did, Captain Laplace thought gloomily, the lunatic with \par
the gun might order him down again. Though he did not for a minute believe that \par
she really was a lunatic; she knew exactly what she was doing.\par
\par
    Suddenly, there was a change in thrust.\par
\par
    'Number Four motor's just cut,' said an engineering officer. 'I'm not \par
surprised - probably overheated. Not rated for so long at this level.'\par
\par
    There was, of course, no sense of any directional change - the reduced \par
thrust was still along the ship's axis - but the views on the monitor screens \par
had tilted crazily. Galaxy was still ascending, but no longer vertically. She \par
had become a ballistic missile, aimed at some unknown target on Europa.\par
\par
    Once more, the thrust dropped abruptly; across the video monitors, the \par
horizon became level again.\par
\par
    'He's cut the opposite motor - only way to stop us cartwheeling - but can he \par
maintain altitude - good man!'\par
\par
    The watching scientists could not see what was good about it; the view on \par
the monitors had disappeared completely, obscured by a blinding white fog.\par
\par
    'He's dumping excess propellant - lightening the ship -'\par
\par
    The thrust dwindled away to zero; the ship was in free fall. In a few \par
seconds, it had dropped through the vast cloud of ice crystals created when its \par
dumped propellant had exploded into space. And there beneath it, approaching at \par
a leisurely one-eighth of a gravity acceleration, was Europa's central sea. At \par
least Chang would not have to select a landing site; from now on, it would be \par
standard operating procedure, familiar as a video game to millions who had never \par
gone into space, and never would.\par
\par
    All you had to do was to balance the thrust against gravity, so that the \par
descending ship reached zero velocity at zero altitude. There was some margin \par
for error, but not much, even for the water landings which the first American \par
astronauts had preferred, and which Chang was now reluctantly emulating. If he \par
made a mistake - and after the last few hours, he could scarcely be blamed - no \par
home computer would say to him: 'Sorry - you've crashed. Would you like to try \par
again? Answer YES/NO...'\par
\par
\par
\par
    Second Officer Yu and his two companions, waiting with their improvised \par
weapons outside the locked door of the bridge, had perhaps been given the \par
toughest assignment of all. They had no monitor screens to tell them what was \par
happening, and had to rely on messages from the wardroom. Nor had there been \par
anything through the spy mike, which was hardly surprising. Chang and McCullen \par
had very little time or need for conversation.\par
\par
    The touchdown was superb, with hardly a jolt. Galaxy sank a few extra \par
metres, then bobbed up again, to float vertically and - thanks to the weight of \par
the engines - in the upright position.\par
\par
    It was then that the listeners heard the first intelligible sounds through \par
the spy mike.\par
\par
    'You maniac, Rosie,' said Chang's voice, more in resigned exhaustion than \par
anger. 'I hope you're satisfied. You've killed us all.'\par
\par
    There was one pistol shot, then a long silence.\par
\par
    Yu and his colleagues waited patiently, knowing that something was bound to \par
happen soon. Then they heard the locking levers being unlatched, and gripped the \par
spanners and metal bars they were carrying. She might get one of them, but not \par
all -The door swung open, very slowly.\par
\par
    'Sorry,' said Second Officer Chang. 'I must have passed out for a minute.'\par
\par
    Then, like any reasonable man, he fainted again.\par
\par
\par
\par
    31\par
    The Sea of Galilee\par
\par
\par
\par
    I can never understand how a man could become a doctor, Captain Laplace told \par
himself. Or an undertaker, for that matter. They have some nasty jobs to do...\par
\par
    'Well, did you find anything?'\par
\par
    'No, Skipper. Of course, I don't have the right sort of equipment. There are \par
some implants that you could only locate through a microscope - or so I'm told. \par
They could only be very short range, though.'\par
\par
    'Perhaps to a relay transmitter somewhere in the ship - Floyd's suggested we \par
make a search. You took fingerprints and - any other idents?'\par
\par
    'Yes - when we contact Ganymede, we'll beam them up, with her papers. But I \par
doubt if we'll ever know who Rosie was, or who she was acting for. Or why, for \par
God's sake.'\par
\par
    'At least she showed some human instincts,' said Laplace thoughtfully. 'She \par
must have known she'd failed, when Chang pulled the ABORT lever. She could have \par
shot him then, instead of letting him land.'\par
\par
    'Much good that will do us, I'm afraid. Let me tell you something that \par
happened when Jenkins and I put the cadaver out through the refuse dump.'\par
\par
    The doctor pursed his lips in a grimace of distaste.\par
\par
    'You were right, of course - it was the only thing to do. Well, we didn't \par
bother to attach any weights - it floated for a few minutes - we watched to see \par
if it would clear the ship - and then...'\par
\par
    The doctor seemed to be struggling for words.\par
\par
    'What, dammit?'\par
\par
    'Something came up out, of the water, Like a parrot beak, but about a \par
hundred times bigger. It took - Rosie - with one snap, and disappeared. We have \par
some impressive company here; even if we could breathe outside, I certainly \par
wouldn't recommend swimming -'\par
\par
    'Bridge to Captain,' said the officer on duty, 'Big disturbance in the water \par
- camera three - I'll give you the picture.'\par
\par
    'That's the thing I saw!' cried the doctor. He felt a sudden chill at the \par
inevitable, ominous thought: I hope it's not back for more.\par
\par
    Suddenly, a vast bulk broke through the surface of the ocean and arched into \par
the sky. For a moment, the whole monstrous shape was suspended between air and \par
water.\par
\par
    The familiar can be as shocking as the strange - when it is in the wrong \par
place. Both captain and doctor exclaimed simultaneously: 'It's a shark!'\par
\par
    There was just time to notice a few subtle differences - in addition to the \par
monstrous parrot-beak - before the giant crashed back into the sea. There was an \par
extra pair of fins - and there appeared to be no gills. Nor were there any eyes, \par
but on either side of the beak there were curious protuberances that might be \par
some other sense organs.\par
\par
    'Convergent evolution, of course,' said the doctor. 'Same problems, same \par
solutions, on any planet. Look at Earth. Sharks, dolphins, ichthyosaurs - all \par
oceanic predators must have the same basic design. That beak puzzles me, though \par
-'\par
\par
    'What's it doing now?'\par
\par
    The creature had surfaced again, but now it was moving very slowly, as if \par
exhausted after that one gigantic leap. In fact, it seemed to be in trouble - \par
even in agony; it was beating its tail against the sea, without attempting to \par
move in any definite direction.\par
\par
    Suddenly, it vomited its last meal, turned belly up, and lay wallowing \par
lifelessly in the gentle swell.\par
\par
    'Oh my God,' whispered the Captain, his voice full of revulsion. 'I think I \par
know what's happened.'\par
\par
    'Totally alien biochemistries,' said the doctor; even he seemed shaken by \par
the sight. 'Rosie's claimed one victim, after all.'\par
\par
\par
\par
    The Sea of Galilee was, of course, named after the man who had discovered \par
Europa - as he in turn had been named after a much smaller sea on another world.\par
\par
    It was a very young sea, being less than fifty years old; and, like most \par
new-born infants, could be quite boisterous. Although the Europan atmosphere was \par
still too thin to generate real hurricanes, a steady wind blew from the \par
surrounding land towards the tropical zone at the point above which Lucifer was \par
stationary. Here, at the point of perpetual noon, the water was continually \par
boiling - though at a temperature, in this thin atmosphere, barely hot enough to \par
make a good cup of tea.\par
\par
    Luckily, the steamy, turbulent region immediately beneath Lucifer was a \par
thousand kilometres away; Galaxy had descended in a relatively calm area, less \par
than a hundred kilometres from the nearest land. At peak velocity, she could \par
cover that distance in a fraction of a second; but now, as she drifted beneath \par
the low-hanging clouds of Europa's permanent overcast, land seemed as far-off as \par
the remotest quasar. To make matters worse - if possible - the eternal off-shore \par
wind was taking her further out to sea. And even if she could manage to ground \par
herself on some virgin beach of this new world, she might be no better off than \par
she was now.\par
\par
    But she would be more comfortable; spaceships, though admirably watertight, \par
are seldom seaworthy. Galaxy was floating in a vertical position, bobbing up and \par
down with gentle but disturbing oscillations; half the crew was already sick.\par
\par
    Captain Laplace's first action, after he had been through the damage \par
reports, was to appeal for anyone with experience in handling boats - of any \par
size or shape. It seemed reasonable to suppose that among thirty astronautical \par
engineers and space scientists there should be a considerable amount of \par
seafaring talent, and he immediately located five amateur sailors and even one \par
professional - Purser Frank Lee who had started his career with the Tsung \par
shipping lines and then switched to space.\par
\par
    Although pursers were more accustomed to handling accounting machines \par
(often, in Frank Lee's case, a two-hundred-year-old ivory abacus) than \par
navigational instruments, they still had to pass exams in basic seamanship. Lee \par
had never had a chance of testing his maritime skills; now, almost a billion \par
kilometres from the South China Sea, his time had come.\par
\par
    'We should flood the propellant tanks,' he told the Captain. 'Then we'll \par
ride lower and won't be bobbing up and down so badly.'\par
\par
    It seemed foolish to let even more water into the ship, and the Captain \par
hesitated.\par
\par
    'Suppose we run aground?'\par
\par
    No one made the obvious comment 'What difference will it make?' Without any \par
serious discussion, it had been assumed that they would be better off on land - \par
if they could ever reach it.\par
\par
    'We can always blow the tanks again. We'll have to do that anyway, when we \par
reach shore, to get the ship into a horizontal position. Thank God we have \par
power...'\par
\par
    His voice trailed off; everyone knew what he meant. Without the auxiliary \par
reactor which was now running the life-support systems, they would all be dead \par
within hours. Now - barring a breakdown - the ship could sustain them \par
indefinitely.\par
\par
    Ultimately, of course, they would starve; they had just had dramatic proof \par
that there was no nourishment, but only poison, in the seas of Europa.\par
\par
    At least they had made contact with Ganymede, so that the entire human race \par
now knew their predicament. The best brains in the Solar System would now be \par
trying to save them. If they failed, the passengers and crew of Galaxy would \par
have the consolation of dying in the full glare of publicity.\par
\par
\par
\par
    IV\par
    AT THE WATER HOLE\par
\par
\par
\par
    32\par
    Diversion\par
\par
\par
\par
    'The latest news,' said Captain Smith to his assembled passengers, 'is that \par
Galaxy is afloat, and in fairly good condition. One crew member - a woman \par
steward - has been killed - we don't know the details - but everyone else is \par
safe.\par
\par
    'The ship's systems are all working; there are a few leaks, but they've been \par
controlled. Captain Laplace says there's no immediate danger, but the prevailing \par
wind is driving them further away from the mainland, towards the centre of \par
dayside. That's not a serious problem - there are several large islands they're \par
virtually certain to reach first. At the moment they're ninety kilometres from \par
the nearest land. They've seen some large marine animals, but they show no sign \par
of hostility.\par
\par
    'Barring further accidents, they should be able to survive for several \par
months, until they run out of food - which of course is now being strictly \par
rationed. But according to Captain Laplace, morale is still high.\par
\par
    'Now, this is where we come in. If we return to Earth immediately, get \par
refuelled and refitted, we can reach Europa in a retrograde, powered orbit in \par
eighty-five days. Universe is the only ship currently commissioned that can land \par
there and take off again with a reasonable payload. The Ganymede shuttles may be \par
able to drop supplies, but that's all - though it may make the difference \par
between life and death.\par
\par
    'I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, that our visit has been cut short - but I \par
think you'll agree that we've shown you everything we promised. And I'm sure \par
you'll approve of our new mission - even though the chances of success are, \par
frankly, rather slim. That's all for the moment. Dr Floyd, can I have a word \par
with you?'\par
\par
    As the others drifted slowly and thoughtfully from the main lounge - scene \par
of so many less portentous briefings - the Captain scanned a clipboard full of \par
messages. There were still occasions when words printed on pieces of paper were \par
the most convenient medium of communication, but even here technology had made \par
its mark. The sheets that the Captain was reading were made of the indefinitely \par
reusable multifax material which had done so much to reduce the load on the \par
humble wastepaper basket.\par
\par
    'Heywood,' he said - now that the formalities were over - 'as you can guess, \par
the circuits are burning up. And there's a lot going on that I don't \par
understand.'\par
\par
    'Ditto,' answered Floyd. 'Anything from Chris yet?'\par
\par
    "No, but Ganymede's relayed your message; he should have had it by now. \par
There's a priority override on private communications, as you can imagine - but \par
of course your name overrode that.'\par
\par
    'Thanks, Skipper. Anything I can do to help?'\par
\par
    'Not really - I'll let you know.'\par
\par
    It was almost the last time, for quite a while, that they would be on \par
speaking terms with each other. Within a few hours Dr Heywood Floyd would become \par
'That crazy old fool!', and the short-lived 'Mutiny on the Universe' would have \par
begun - led by the Captain.\par
\par
\par
\par
    It was not actually Heywood Floyd's idea; he only wished it was.\par
\par
    Second Officer Roy Jolson was 'Stars', the navigation officer; Floyd barely \par
knew him by sight, and had never had occasion to say more than good morning to \par
him. He was quite surprised, therefore, by the diffident knock on his cabin \par
door.\par
\par
    The astrogator was carrying a set of charts, and seemed a little ill at \par
ease. He could not be overawed by Floyd's presence - everyone on board now took \par
him for granted - so there must be some other reason.\par
\par
    'Dr Floyd,' he began, in a tone of such urgent anxiety that he reminded his \par
listener of a salesman whose entire future depends on making the next deal. 'I'd \par
like your advice - and assistance.'\par
\par
    'Of course - but what can I do?'\par
\par
    Jolson unrolled the chart showing the position of all the planets inside the \par
orbit of Lucifer.\par
\par
    'Your old trick of coupling Leonov and Discovery, to escape from Jupiter \par
before it blew up, gave me the idea.'\par
\par
    'It wasn't mine. Walter Curnow thought of it.'\par
\par
    'Oh - I never knew that. Of course, we don't have another ship to boost us \par
here - but we have something much better.'\par
\par
    'What do you mean?' asked Floyd, completely baffled.\par
\par
    'Don't laugh. Why go back to Earth to take on propellant - when Old Faithful \par
is blasting out tons every second, a couple of hundred metres away? If we tapped \par
that, we could get to Europa not in three months - but in three weeks.'\par
\par
    The concept was so obvious, yet so daring, that it took Floyd's breath away. \par
He could see half a dozen objections instantly; but none of them seemed fatal.\par
\par
    'What does the Captain think of the idea?'\par
\par
    'I've not told him; that's why I need your help. I'd like you to check my \par
calculations - then put the idea to him. He'd turn me down - I'm quite certain - \par
and I don't blame him. If I was captain, I think I would too...'\par
\par
    There was a long silence in the little cabin. Then Heywood Floyd said \par
slowly: 'Let me give you all the reasons why it can't be done. Then you can tell \par
me why I'm wrong.'\par
\par
\par
\par
    Second Officer Jolson knew his commander; Captain Smith had never heard such \par
a crazy suggestion in his life.\par
\par
    His objections were all well-founded, and showed little, if any, trace of \par
the notorious 'not invented here' syndrome.\par
\par
    'Oh, it would work in theory,' he admitted. 'But think of the practical \par
problems, man! How would you get the stuff into the tanks?'\par
\par
    'I've talked to the engineers. We'd move the ship to the edge of the crater \par
- it's quite safe to get within fifty metres. There's plumbing in the \par
unfurnished section we can rip out - then we'd run a line to Old Faithful and \par
wait until he spouts; you know how reliable and well-behaved he is.'\par
\par
    'But our pumps can't operate in a near vacuum!'\par
\par
    'We don't need them; we can rely on the geyser's own efflux velocity to give \par
us an input of at least a hundred kilos a second. Old Faithful will do all the \par
work.'\par
\par
    'He'll just give ice crystals and steam, not liquid water.'\par
\par
    'It will condense when it gets on board.'\par
\par
    'You've really thought this out, haven't you?' said the Captain with \par
grudging admiration. 'But I just don't believe it. Is the water pure enough, for \par
one thing? What about contaminants - especially carbon particles?'\par
\par
    Floyd could not help smiling. Captain Smith was developing an obsession \par
about soot...\par
\par
    'We can filter out large ones; the rest won't affect the reaction. Oh yes - \par
the hydrogen isotope ratio here looks better than for Earth. You may even get \par
some extra thrust.'\par
\par
    'What do your colleagues think of the idea? If we head straight for Lucifer, \par
it may be months before they can get home...\par
\par
    'I've not spoken to them. But does it matter, when so many lives are at \par
stake? We may reach Galaxy seventy days ahead of schedule! Seventy days! Think \par
what could happen on Europa in that time!'\par
\par
    'I'm perfectly aware of the time factor,' snapped the Captain. 'That applies \par
to us as well. We may not have provisions for such an extended trip.'\par
\par
    Now he's straining at gnats, thought Floyd - and he must know that I know \par
it. Better be tactful...\par
\par
    'An extra couple of weeks? I can't believe we have so narrow a margin. \par
You've been feeding us too well, anyway. Do some of us good to be on short \par
rations for a while.'\par
\par
    The Captain managed a frosty smile.\par
\par
    'You can tell that to Willis and Mihailovich. But I'm afraid the whole idea \par
is insane.'\par
\par
    'At least let us try it on the owners. I'd like to speak to Sir Lawrence.'\par
\par
    'I can't stop you, of course,' said Captain Smith, in a tone that suggested \par
he wished he could. 'But I know exactly what he'll say.'\par
\par
    He was quite wrong.\par
\par
\par
\par
    Sir Lawrence Tsung had not placed a bet for thirty years; it was no longer \par
in keeping with his august position in the world of commerce. But as a young man \par
he had often enjoyed a mild flutter at the Hong Kong Race Course, before a \par
puritanical administration had closed it in a fit of public morality. It was \par
typical of life, Sir Lawrence sometimes thought wistfully, that when he could \par
bet he had no money - and now he couldn't, because the richest man in the world \par
had to set a good example.\par
\par
    And yet, as nobody knew better than he did, his whole business career had \par
been one long gamble. He had done his utmost to control the odds, by gathering \par
the best information and listening to the experts his hunches told him would \par
give the wisest advice. He had usually pulled out in time when they were wrong; \par
but there had always been an element of risk.\par
\par
    Now, as he read the memorandum from Heywood Floyd, he felt again the old \par
thrill he had not known since he had watched the horses thundering round into \par
the last lap. Here was a gamble indeed - perhaps the last and greatest of his \par
career - though he would never dare tell his Board of Directors. Still less the \par
Lady Jasmine.\par
\par
    'Bill,' he said, 'what do you think?'\par
\par
    His son (steady and reliable, but lacking that vital spark which was perhaps \par
no longer needed in this generation) gave him the answer he expected.\par
\par
    'The theory is quite sound. Universe can do it - on paper. But we've lost \par
one ship. We'll be risking another.'\par
\par
    'She's going to Jupiter - Lucifer - anyway.'\par
\par
    'Yes - but after a complete checkout in Earth orbit. And do you realize what \par
this proposed direct mission will involve? She'll be smashing all speed records \par
- doing over a thousand kilometres a second at turnaround!'\par
\par
    It was the worst thing he could possibly have said; once again the thunder \par
of hooves sounded in his father's ears.\par
\par
    But Sir Lawrence merely answered: 'It won't do any harm for them to make \par
some tests, though Captain Smith is fighting the idea tooth and nail. Even \par
threatens to resign. Meanwhile, just check the position with Lloyd's - we may \par
have to back down on the Galaxy claim.'\par
\par
    Especially, he might have added, if we're going to throw Universe on to the \par
table, as an even bigger chip.\par
\par
    And he was worried about Captain Smith. Now that Laplace was stranded on \par
Europa, he was the best commander he had left.\par
\par
\par
\par
    33\par
    Pit Stop\par
\par
\par
\par
    'Sloppiest job I've seen since I left college,' grumbled the Chief Engineer. \par
'But it's the best we can do in the time.'\par
\par
    The makeshift pipeline stretched across fifty metres of dazzling, chemical-\par
encrusted rock to the now quiescent vent of Old Faithful, where it ended in a \par
rectangular, downward-pointing funnel. The sun had just risen over the hills, \par
and already the ground had begun to tremble slightly as the geyser's \par
subterranean - or subhallean - reservoirs felt the first touch of warmth.\par
\par
    Watching from the observation lounge, Heywood Floyd could hardly believe \par
that so much had happened in a mere twenty-four hours. First of all, the ship \par
had split into two rival factions - one led by the Captain, the other perforce \par
headed by himself. They had been coldly polite to each other, and there had been \par
no actual exchange of blows; but he had discovered that in certain quarters he \par
now rejoiced in the nickname of 'Suicide' Floyd. It was not an honour that he \par
particularly appreciated.\par
\par
    Yet no-one could find anything fundamentally wrong with the Floyd-Jolson \par
manoeuvre. (That name was also unfair: he had insisted that Jolson get all the \par
credit, but no-one had listened. And Mihailovich had said: 'Aren't you prepared \par
to share the blame?')\par
\par
    The first test would be in twenty minutes, when Old Faithful, rather \par
belatedly, greeted the dawn. But even if that worked, and the propellant tanks \par
started to fill with sparkling pure water rather than the muddy slurry Captain \par
Smith had predicted, the road to Europa was still not open.\par
\par
    A minor, but not unimportant, factor was the wishes of the distinguished \par
passengers. They had expected to be home within two weeks; now, to their \par
surprise and in some cases consternation, they were faced with the prospect of a \par
dangerous mission halfway across the Solar System - and, even if it succeeded, \par
no firm date for a return to Earth.\par
\par
    Willis was distraught; all his schedules would be totally wrecked. He \par
drifted around muttering about lawsuits, but no-one expressed the slightest \par
sympathy.\par
\par
    Greenburg, on the other hand, was ecstatic; now he would really be in the \par
space business again! And Mihailovich - who spent a lot of time noisily \par
composing in his far from soundproof cabin - was almost equally delighted. He \par
was sure that the diversion would inspire him to new heights of creativity.\par
\par
    Maggie M was philosophical: 'If it can save a lot of lives,' she said, \par
looking pointedly at Willis, 'how can anyone possibly object?'\par
\par
    As for Yva Merlin, Floyd made a special effort to explain matters to her, \par
and discovered that she understood the situation remarkably well. And it was \par
Yva, to his utter astonishment, who asked the question to which no-one else \par
seemed to have paid much attention: 'Suppose the Europans don't want us to land \par
- even to rescue our friends?'\par
\par
    Floyd looked at her in frank amazement; even now, he still found it \par
difficult to accept her as a real human being, and never knew when she would \par
come out with some brilliant insight or utter stupidity.\par
\par
    'That's a very good question, Yva. Believe me, I'm working on it.'\par
\par
    He was telling the truth; he could never lie to Yva Merlin. That, somehow, \par
would be an act of sacrilege.\par
\par
\par
\par
    The first wisps of vapour were appearing over the mouth of the geyser. They \par
shot upwards and away in their unnatural vacuum trajectories, and evaporated \par
swiftly in the fierce Sunlight.\par
\par
    Old Faithful coughed again, and cleared its throat. A snowy-white - and \par
surprisingly compact - column of ice crystals and water droplets climbed swiftly \par
towards the sky. All one's terrestrial instincts expected it to topple and fall, \par
but of course it did not. It continued onwards and upwards, spreading only \par
slightly, until it merged into the vast, glowing envelope of the comet's still \par
expanding coma. Floyd noted, with satisfaction, that the pipeline was beginning \par
to shake as fluid rushed into it.\par
\par
    Ten minutes later, there was a council of war on the bridge. Captain Smith, \par
still in a huff, acknowledged Floyd's presence with a slight nod; his Number \par
Two, a little embarrassed, did all the talking.\par
\par
    'Well, it works, surprisingly well. At this rate, we can fill our tanks in \par
twenty hours - though we may have to go out and anchor the pipe more securely.'\par
\par
    'What about the dirt?' someone asked.\par
\par
    The First Officer held up a transparent squeeze-bulb holding a colourless \par
liquid.\par
\par
    'The filters got rid of everything down to a few microns, To be on the safe \par
side, we'll run through them twice, cycling from one tank to another. No \par
swimming pool, I'm afraid, until we pass Mars.'\par
\par
    That got a much needed laugh, and even the Captain relaxed a little.\par
\par
    'We'll run up the engines, at minimum thrust, to check that there are no \par
operational anomalies with Halley H20. If there are, we'll forget the whole \par
idea, and head home on good old Moon water, fob Aristarchus.'\par
\par
    There was one of those 'party silences' where everyone waits simultaneously \par
for someone else to speak. Then Captain Smith broke the embarrassing hiatus.\par
\par
    'As you all know,' he said, 'I'm very unhappy with the whole idea. In fact - \par
' he changed course abruptly; it was equally well-known that he had considered \par
sending Sir Lawrence his resignation, though in the circumstances that would \par
have been a somewhat pointless gesture.\par
\par
    'But a couple of things have happened in the last few hours. The owner \par
agrees with the project - if no fundamental objections emerge from our tests. \par
And - this is the big surprise, and I don't know any more about it than you do - \par
the World Space Council has not only okayed but requested that we make the \par
diversion, underwriting any expenses incurred. Your guess is as good as mine...\par
\par
    'But I still have one worry -' he looked doubtfully at the little bulb of \par
water, which Heywood Floyd was now holding up to the light and shaking gently. \par
'I'm an engineer, not a damn chemist. This stuff looks clean - but what will it \par
do to the tank linings?'\par
\par
    Floyd never quite understood why he acted as he did; such rashness was \par
completely uncharacteristic. Perhaps he was simply impatient with the whole \par
debate, and wanted to get on with the job. Or perhaps he felt that the Captain \par
needed a little stiffening of the moral fibre.\par
\par
    With one quick movement, he flicked open the stopcock and squirted \par
approximately 20cc of Halley's Comet down his throat.\par
\par
    'There's your answer, Captain,' he said, when he had finished swallowing.\par
\par
\par
\par
    'And that,' said the ship's doctor half an hour later, 'was one of the \par
silliest exhibitions I've ever seen. Don't you know that there are cyanides and \par
cyanogens and God knows what else in that stuff?'\par
\par
    'Of course, I do,' laughed Floyd. 'I've seen the analyses - just a few parts \par
in a million. Nothing to worry about, But I did have one surprise,' he added \par
ruefully.\par
\par
    'And what was that?'\par
\par
    'If you could ship this stuff back to Earth, you could make a fortune \par
selling it as Halley's Patent Purgative.'\par
\par

\par
\par
    Now that they were committed, the whole atmosphere aboard Universe had \par
changed. There was no more argument; everyone was cooperating to the utmost, and \par
very few people had much sleep for the next two rotations of the nucleus - a \par
hundred hours of Earth time.\par
\par
    The first Halley 'day' was devoted to a still rather cautious tapping of Old \par
Faithful, but when the geyser subsided towards nightfall the technique had been \par
thoroughly mastered. More than a thousand tons of water had been taken aboard; \par
the next period of daylight would be ample for the rest.\par
\par
    Heywood Floyd kept out of the Captain's way, not wishing to press his luck; \par
in any event, Smith had a thousand details to attend to. But the calculation of \par
the new orbit was not among them; that had been checked and rechecked on Earth.\par
\par
    There was no doubt, now, that the concept was brilliant, and the savings \par
even greater than Jolson had claimed. By refuelling on Halley, Universe had \par
eliminated the two major orbit changes involved in the rendezvous with Earth; \par
she could now go straight to her goal, under maximum acceleration, saving many \par
weeks. Despite the possible risks, everyone now applauded the scheme.\par
\par
    Well, almost everyone.\par
\par
    On Earth, the swiftly organized 'Hands off Halley!' society was indignant. \par
Its members (a mere 236, but they knew how to drum up publicity) did not \par
consider the rifling of a celestial body justified, even to save lives. They \par
refused to be placated even when it was pointed out that Universe was merely \par
borrowing material that the comet was about to lose anyway. It was, they argued, \par
the principle of the thing. Their angry communiqu\'e9s gave much needed light \par
relief aboard Universe.\par
\par
    Cautious as ever, Captain Smith ran the first low-powered tests with one of \par
the attitude-control thrusters; if this became unserviceable, the ship could \par
manage without it, There were no anomalies; the engine behaved exactly as if it \par
was running on the best distilled water from the lunar mines.\par
\par
    Then he tested the central main engine, Number One; if that was damaged, \par
there would be no loss of manoeuvrability - only of total thrust. The ship would \par
still be fully controllable, but, with the four remaining outboards alone, peak \par
acceleration would be down by twenty per cent.\par
\par
    Again, there were no problems; even the sceptics started being polite to \par
Heywood Floyd, and Second Officer Jolson was no longer a social outcast.\par
\par
    The lift-off was scheduled late in the afternoon, just before Old Faithful \par
was due to subside. (Would it still be there to greet the next visitors in \par
seventy-six years' time? Floyd wondered. Perhaps; there were hints of its \par
existence even back on the 1910 photographs.)\par
\par
    There was no countdown, in the dramatic oldtime Cape Canaveral style. When \par
he was quite satisfied that everything was shipshape, Captain Smith applied a \par
mere five tons of thrust on Number One, and Universe drifted slowly upwards and \par
away from the comet.\par
\par
    The acceleration was modest, but the pyrotechnics were awe-inspiring - and, \par
to most of the watchers, wholly unexpected. Until now, the jets from the main \par
engines had been virtually invisible, being formed entirely of highly ionized \par
oxygen and hydrogen. Even when - hundreds of kilometres away - the gases had \par
cooled off enough to combine chemically, there was still nothing to be seen, \par
because the reaction gave no light in the visible spectrum.\par
\par
    But now, Universe was climbing away from Halley on a column of incandescence \par
too brilliant for the eye to look upon; it seemed almost a solid pillar of \par
flame. Where it hit the ground, rock exploded upwards and outwards; as it \par
departed for ever, Universe was carving its signature, like cosmic graffiti, \par
across the nucleus of Halley's Comet.\par
\par
    Most of the passengers, accustomed to climbing spacewards with no visible \par
means of support, reacted with considerable shock. Floyd waited for the \par
inevitable explanation; one of his minor pleasures was catching Willis in some \par
scientific error, but this very seldom happened. And even when it did, Willis \par
always had some very plausible excuse.\par
\par
    'Carbon,' he said. 'Incandescent carbon - exactly as in a candle flame - but \par
slightly hotter.'\par
\par
    'Slightly,' murmured Floyd.\par
\par
    'We're no longer burning - if you'll excuse the word -, (Floyd shrugged his \par
shoulders) 'pure water. Although it's been carefully filtered, there's a lot of \par
colloidal carbon in it. As well as compounds that could only be removed by \par
distillation.'\par
\par
    'It's very impressive, but I'm a little worried,' said Greenburg. 'All that \par
radiation - won't it affect the engines - and heat the ship badly?'\par
\par
    It was a very good question, and it had caused some anxiety. Floyd waited \par
for Willis to handle it; but that shrewd operator bounced the ball right back to \par
him.\par
\par
    'I'd prefer Dr Floyd to deal with that - after all, it was his idea.'\par
\par
    'Jolson's, please. Good point, though. But it's no real problem; when we're \par
under full thrust, all those fireworks will be a thousand kilometres behind us. \par
We won't have to worry about them.'\par
\par
    The ship was now hovering some two kilometres above the nucleus; had it not \par
been for the glare of the exhaust, the whole sunlit face of the tiny world would \par
have been spread out beneath. At this altitude - or distance - the column of Old \par
Faithful had broadened slightly. It looked, Floyd suddenly recalled, like one of \par
the giant fountains ornamenting Lake Geneva. He had not seen them for fifty \par
years, and wondered if they still played there.\par
\par
    Captain Smith was testing the controls, slowly rotating the ship, then \par
pitching and yawing it along the Y and Z axes. Everything seemed to be \par
functioning perfectly.\par
\par
    'Mission time zero is ten minutes from now,' he announced. '0.1 gee for \par
fifty hours; then 0.2 until turnaround - one hundred and fifty hours from now.' \par
He paused to let that sink in; no other ship had ever attempted to maintain so \par
high a continuous acceleration, for so long. If Universe was not able to brake \par
properly, she would also enter the history books as the first manned \par
interstellar voyager.\par
\par
    The ship was now turning towards the horizontal - if that word could be used \par
in this almost gravityless environment - and was pointing directly to the white \par
column of mist and ice crystals still steadily spurting from the comet. Universe \par
started to move towards it -\par
\par
    'What's he doing?' said Mihailovich anxiously.\par
\par
    Obviously anticipating such questions, the Captain spoke again. He seemed to \par
have completely recovered his good humour, and there was a hint of amusement in \par
his voice.\par
\par
    'Just one little chore before we leave, Don't worry - I know exactly what \par
I'm doing. And Number Two agrees with me - don't you?'\par
\par
    'Yessir - though I thought you were joking at first.'\par
\par
    'What is going on up on the bridge?' asked Willis, for once at a loss.\par
\par
    Now the ship was starting a slow roll, while still moving at no more than a \par
good walking speed towards the geyser. From this distance - now less than a \par
hundred metres - it reminded Floyd still more closely of those far-off Geneva \par
fountains.\par
\par
    Surely he's not taking us into it - But he was. Universe vibrated gently as \par
it nuzzled its way into the rising column of foam. It was still rolling very \par
slowly, as if it was drilling its way into the giant geyser. The video monitors \par
and observation windows showed only a milky blankness.\par
\par
    The whole operation could not have lasted more than ten seconds; then they \par
were out on the other side. There was a brief burst of spontaneous clapping from \par
the officers on the bridge; but the passengers - even including Floyd - still \par
felt somewhat put-upon.\par
\par
    'Now we're ready to go,' said the Captain, in tones of great satisfaction. \par
'We have a nice, clean ship again.'\par
\par
\par
\par
    During the next half-hour, more than ten thousand amateur observers on Earth \par
and Moon reported that the comet had doubled its brightness. The Comet Watch \par
Network broke down completely under the overload, and the professional \par
astronomers were furious.\par
\par
    But the public loved it, and a few days later Universe put on an even better \par
show, a few hours before dawn.\par
\par
    The ship, gaining speed by more than ten thousand kilometres an hour, every \par
hour, was now far inside the orbit of Venus. It would get even closer to the sun \par
before it made its perihelion passage - far more swiftly than any natural \par
celestial body - and headed out towards Lucifer.\par
\par
    As it passed between Earth and Sun, the thousand kilometre tail of \par
incandescent carbon was easily visible as a fourth magnitude star, showing \par
appreciable movement against the constellations of the morning sky in the course \par
of a single hour. At the very beginning of its rescue mission, Universe would be \par
seen by more human beings, at the same moment, than any artefact in the history \par
of the world.\par
\par
\par

\par
\par
\par
    The unexpected news that their sister ship Universe was on the way - and \par
might arrive far sooner than anyone had dared to dream - had an effect upon the \par
morale of Galaxy's crew that could only be called euphoric. The mere fact that \par
they were drifting helplessly on a strange ocean, surrounded by unknown \par
monsters, suddenly seemed of minor importance.\par
\par
    As did the monsters themselves, though they made interesting appearances \par
from time to time. The giant 'sharks' were sighted occasionally, but never came \par
near the ship, even when garbage was dumped overboard. This was quite \par
surprising; it strongly suggested that the great beasts - unlike their \par
terrestrial counterparts - had a good system of communication. Perhaps they were \par
more closely allied to dolphins than to sharks.\par
\par
    There were many schools of smaller fish, which no-one would have given a \par
second glance in a market on Earth. After several attempts, one of the officers \par
- a keen angler - managed to catch one with an unbaited hook. He never brought \par
it in through the airlock - the Captain would not have permitted it, anyway - \par
but measured and photographed it carefully before returning it to the sea.\par
\par
    The proud sportsman had to pay a price for his trophy, however. The partial-\par
pressure spacesuit he had worn during the exercise had the characteristic \par
'rotten eggs' stink of hydrogen sulphide when he brought it back into the ship, \par
and he became the butt of innumerable jokes. It was yet another reminder of an \par
alien, and implacably hostile, biochemistry.\par
\par
    Despite the pleas of the scientists, no further angling was allowed. They \par
could watch and record, but not collect, And anyway, it was pointed out, they \par
were planetary geologists, not naturalists. No-one had thought of bringing \par
formalin - which probably would not work here in any event.\par
\par
    Once, the ship drifted for several hours through floating mats or sheets of \par
some bright green material. It formed ovals, about ten metres across, and all of \par
approximately the same size, Galaxy ploughed through them without resistance, \par
and they swiftly reformed behind her. It was guessed that they were colonial \par
organisms of some kind.\par
\par
    And one morning, the officer of the watch was startled when a periscope rose \par
out of the water and he found himself staring into a mild, blue eye which, he \par
said when he had recovered, looked like a sick cow's. It regarded him sadly for \par
a few moments, without much apparent interest, then slowly returned to the \par
ocean,\par
\par
    Nothing seemed to move very fast here, and the reason was obvious. This was \par
still a low-energy world - there was none of the free oxygen that allowed the \par
animals of Earth to live by a series of continuous explosions, from the moment \par
they started to breathe at birth. Only the 'shark' of that first encounter had \par
shown any sign of violent activity - in its last, dying spasm.\par
\par
    Perhaps that was good news for men. Even if they were encumbered with \par
spacesuits, there was probably nothing on Europa that could catch them -even if \par
it wanted to.\par
\par
\par
\par
    Captain Laplace found wry amusement in handing over the operation of his \par
ship to the purser; he wondered if this situation was unique, in the annals of \par
space and sea.\par
\par
    Not that there was a great deal that Mr Lee could do. Galaxy was floating \par
vertically, one-third out of the water, heeling slightly before a wind that was \par
driving it at a steady five knots. There were only a few leaks below the \par
waterline, easily handled. Equally important, the hull was still airtight.\par
\par
    Although most of the navigation equipment was useless, they knew exactly \par
where they were. Ganymede gave them an accurate fix on their emergency beacon \par
every hour, and if Galaxy kept to her present course she would make landfall on \par
a large island within the next three days. If she missed that, she would head on \par
out to the open sea, and eventually reach the tepidly boiling zone immediately \par
underneath Lucifer. Though not necessarily catastrophic, that was a most \par
unattractive prospect; Acting Captain Lee spent much of his time thinking of \par
ways to avoid it.\par
\par
    Sails - even if he had suitable material and rigging - would make very \par
little difference to their course. He had lowered improvised sea-anchors down to \par
five hundred metres, looking for currents that might be useful, and finding \par
none. Nor had he found the bottom; it lay unknown kilometres further down.\par
\par
    Perhaps that was just as well; it protected them from the submarine quakes \par
that continually. racked this new ocean. Sometimes Galaxy would shake as if \par
struck by a giant hammer, as a shockwave went racing by. In a few hours, a \par
tsunami, dozens of metres high, would crash upon some Europan shore; but here in \par
deep water the deadly waves were little more than ripples.\par
\par
    Several times, sudden vortexes were observed at a distance; they looked \par
quite dangerous - maelstroms that might even suck Galaxy down to unknown depths \par
- but luckily they were too far off to do more than make the ship spin around a \par
few times in the water.\par
\par
    And just once, a huge bubble of gas rose and burst only a hundred metres \par
away. It was most impressive, and everyone seconded the doctor's heartfelt \par
comment: 'Thank God we can't smell it.'\par
\par
\par
\par
    It is surprising how quickly the most bizarre situation can become routine. \par
Within a few days, life aboard Galaxy had settled down to a steady routine, and \par
Captain Laplace's main problem was keeping the crew occupied. There was nothing \par
worse for morale than idleness, and he wondered how the skippers of the old \par
windjammers had kept their men busy on those interminable voyages. They couldn't \par
have spent all their time scrambling up the rigging or cleaning the decks.\par
\par
    He had the opposite problem with the scientists. They were always proposing \par
tests and experiments, which had to be carefully considered before they could be \par
approved. And if he allowed it, they would have monopolized the ship's now very \par
limited communications channels.\par
\par
    The main antenna complex was now being battered around at the waterline, and \par
Galaxy could no longer talk directly to Earth. Everything had to be relayed \par
through Ganymede, on a bandwidth of a few miserable megahertz. A single live \par
video channel pre-empted everything else, and he had to resist the clamour of \par
the terrestrial networks. Not that they would have a great deal to show their \par
audiences, except open sea, cramped ship interiors, and a crew which, though in \par
good spirits, was becoming steadily more hirsute.\par
\par
    An unusual amount of traffic seemed directed to Second Officer Floyd whose \par
encrypted responses were so brief that they could not have contained much \par
information. Laplace finally decided to have a talk to the young man.\par
\par
    'Mr Floyd,' he said, in the privacy of his cabin. 'I'd appreciate it if you \par
would enlighten me about your part-time occupation.'\par
\par
    Floyd looked embarrassed, and clutched at the table as the ship rocked \par
slightly in a sudden gust.\par
\par
    'I wish I could, sir, but I'm not permitted.'\par
\par
    'By whom, may I ask?'\par
\par
    'Frankly, I'm not sure.'\par
\par
    That was perfectly true. He suspected it was ASTROPOL, but the two quietly \par
impressive gentlemen who had briefed him on Ganymede had unaccountably failed to \par
provide this information.\par
\par
    'As captain of this ship - especially in the present circumstances - I would \par
like to know what's going on here. If we get out of this, I'm going to spend the \par
next few years of my life at Courts of Enquiry. And you'll probably be doing the \par
same.'\par
\par
    Floyd managed a wry grin.\par
\par
    'Hardly worth being rescued, is it, Sir? All I know is that some high-level \par
agency expected trouble on this mission, but didn't know what form it would \par
take. I was just told to keep my eyes open. I'm afraid I didn't do much good, \par
but I imagine I was the only qualified person they could get hold of in time.'\par
\par
    'I don't think you can blame yourself. Who would have imagined that Rosie -'\par
\par
    The Captain paused, struck by a sudden thought.\par
\par
    'Do you suspect anyone else?' He felt like adding 'Me, for instance?', but \par
the situation was already sufficiently paranoiac.\par
\par
    Floyd looked thoughtful, then apparently came to a decision.\par
\par
    'Perhaps I should have spoken to you before, Sir, but I know how busy you've \par
been. I'm sure Dr van der Berg is involved somehow. He's a Mede, of course; \par
they're odd people, and I don't really understand them.' Or like them, he might \par
have added. Too clannish - not really friendly to offworlders. Still, one could \par
hardly blame them; all pioneers trying to tame a new wilderness were probably \par
much the same.\par
\par
    'Van der Berg - hmm. What about the other scientists?'\par
\par
    'They've been checked, of course. All perfectly legitimate, and nothing \par
unusual about any of them.'\par
\par
    That was not altogether true. Dr Simpson had more wives than was strictly \par
legal, at least at one time, and Dr Higgins had a large collection of most \par
curious books. Second Officer Floyd was not quite sure why he had been told all \par
this; perhaps his mentors merely wanted to impress him with their omniscience. \par
He decided that working for ASTROPOL (or whoever it was) had some entertaining \par
fringe benefits.\par
\par
    'Very well,' said the Captain, dismissing the amateur agent. 'But please \par
keep me informed if you discover anything - anything at all- that might affect \par
the safety of the ship.'\par
\par
    In the present circumstances, it was hard to imagine what that might be. Any \par
further hazards seemed slightly superfluous.\par
\par
\par
\par

    The Alien Shore\par
\par
\par
\par
    Even twenty-four hours before they sighted the island, it was still not \par
certain whether Galaxy would miss it and be blown on out into the emptiness of \par
the central ocean. Her position, as observed by the Ganymede radar, was plotted \par
on a large chart which everyone aboard examined anxiously several times a day.\par
\par
    Even if the ship did reach land, her problems might be just beginning. She \par
might be pounded to pieces on a rocky coast, rather than gently deposited on \par
some conveniently shelving beach.\par
\par
    Acting Captain Lee was keenly aware of all these possibilities. He had once \par
been shipwrecked himself, in a cabin cruiser whose engines had failed at a \par
critical moment, off the island of Bali. There had been little danger, though a \par
good deal of drama, and he had no wish to repeat the experience - especially as \par
there was no coastguard here to come to the rescue.\par
\par
    There was a truly cosmic irony in their plight. Here they were, aboard one \par
of the most advanced transportation devices ever made by man - capable of \par
crossing the Solar System! - yet now they could not deflect it more than a few \par
metres from its course. Nevertheless, they were not completely helpless; Lee \par
still had a few cards to play.\par
\par
    On this sharply curving world, the island was only five kilometres away when \par
they first sighted it. To Lee's great relief, there were none of the cliffs he \par
had feared; nor, on the other hand, was there any sign of the beach he had hoped \par
for. The geologists had warned him that he was a few million years too early to \par
find sand here; the mills of Europa, grinding slowly, had not yet had time to do \par
their work.\par
\par
    As soon as it was certain they would hit the land, Lee gave orders to pump \par
out Galaxy's main tanks, which he had deliberately flooded soon after touchdown. \par
Then followed a very uncomfortable few hours, during which at least a quarter of \par
the crew took no further interest in the proceedings.\par
\par
    Galaxy rose higher and higher in the water, oscillating more and more wildly \par
- then tumbled with a mighty splash, to lie along the surface, like the corpse \par
of a whale in the bad old days when the catcher-boats pumped them full of air to \par
stop them sinking. When he saw how the ship was lying, Lee adjusted her buoyancy \par
again, until she was slightly stern-down, and the forward bridge was just clear \par
of the water.\par
\par
    As he expected, Galaxy then swung broadside-on to the wind. Another quarter \par
of the crew became incapacitated then, but Lee had enough helpers to get out the \par
sea-anchor he had prepared for this final act. It was merely an improvised raft, \par
made of empty boxes lashed together, but its drag caused the ship to point \par
towards the approaching land.\par
\par
    Now they could see that they were heading - with agonizing slowness - \par
towards a narrow stretch of beach, covered with small boulders. If they could \par
not have sand, this was the best alternative...\par
\par
    The bridge was already over the beach when Galaxy grounded, and Lee played \par
his last card. He had made only a single test-run, not daring to do more in case \par
the abused machinery failed.\par
\par
    For the last time, Galaxy extended her landing gear. There was a grinding \par
and shuddering as the pads on the underside dug their way into the alien beach. \par
Now she was securely anchored against the winds and waves of this tideless \par
ocean.\par
\par
    There was no doubt that Galaxy had found her final resting place - and, all \par
too possibly, that of her crew.\par

    Star\par
\par
\par
\par
    And now Universe was moving so swiftly that its orbit no longer even \par
remotely resembled that of any natural object in the Solar System. Mercury, \par
closest to the Sun, barely exceeds fifty kilometres a second at perihelion; \par
Universe had reached twice that speed in the first day - and at only half the \par
acceleration it would achieve when it was lighter by several thousand tons of \par
water.\par
\par
    For a few hours, as they passed inside its orbit, Venus was the brightest of \par
all heavenly bodies, next to the Sun and Lucifer. Its tiny disc was just visible \par
to the naked eye, but even the ship's most powerful telescopes showed no \par
markings whatever. Venus guarded her secrets as jealously as Europa.\par
\par
    By going still closer to the Sun - well inside the orbit of Mercury - \par
Universe was not merely taking a short cut, but was also getting a free boost \par
from the Sun's gravitational field. Because nature always balances her books, \par
the Sun lost some velocity in the transaction; but the effect would not be \par
measurable for a few thousand years.\par
\par
    Captain Smith used the ship's perihelion passage to restore some of the \par
prestige his foot-dragging had cost him.\par
\par
    'Now you know,' he said, 'exactly why I flew the ship through Old Faithful. \par
If we hadn't washed all that dirt off the hull, by this time we'd be badly \par
overheating. In fact, I doubt if the thermal controls would have handled the \par
load - it's already ten times Earth level.' Looking - through filters that were \par
almost black - at the hideously swollen Sun, his passengers could easily believe \par
him. They were all more than happy when it had shrunk back to normal size - and \par
continued to dwindle astern as Universe sliced across the orbit of Mars, outward \par
bound on the final leg of its mission.\par
\par
    The 'Famous Five' had all adjusted, in their various ways, to the unexpected \par
change in their lives. Mihailovich was composing copiously and noisily, and was \par
seldom seen except when he emerged at meals, to tell outrageous stories and \par
tease all available victims, especially Willis. Greenburg had elected himself, \par
no-one dissenting, an honorary crew member, and spent much of his time on the \par
bridge.\par
\par
    Maggie M viewed the situation with rueful amusement.\par
\par
    'Writers,' she remarked, 'are always saying what a lot of work they could do \par
if they were only in some place with no interruptions - no engagements; \par
lighthouses and prisons are their favourite examples. So I can't complain - \par
except that my requests for research material keep getting delayed by high \par
priority messages.'\par
\par
    Even Victor Willis had now come to much the same conclusion; he too was \par
busily at work on sundry long-range projects. And he had an additional reason to \par
keep to his cabin. It would still be several weeks before he looked as if he had \par
forgotten to shave, and months before he returned to his full glory.\par
\par
    Yva Merlin spent hours every day in the entertainment centre, catching up - \par
as she readily explained - with her favourite classics. It was fortunate that \par
Universe's library and projection facilities had been installed in time for the \par
voyage; though the collection was still relatively small, there was sufficient \par
for several lifetimes of viewing.\par
\par
    All the famous works of visual art were there, right back to the flickering \par
dawn of the cinema. Yva knew most of them, and was happy to share her knowledge.\par
\par
    Floyd, of course, enjoyed listening to her, because then she became alive - \par
an ordinary human being, not an icon. He found it both sad and fascinating that \par
only through an artificial universe of video images could she establish contact \par
with the real world.\par
\par
    One of the strangest experiences of Heywood Floyd's fairly eventful life was \par
sitting in semi-darkness just behind Yva, somewhere outside the orbit of Mars, \par
while they watched the original Gone with the Wind together. There were moments \par
when he could see her famous profile silhouetted against that of Vivien Leigh, \par
and could compare the two - though it was impossible to say that one actress was \par
better than the other; both were sui generis.\par
\par
    When the lights went up, he was astonished to see that Yva was crying. He \par
took her hand and said tenderly: 'I cried too, when Bonny died.'\par
\par
    Yva managed a faint smile.\par
\par
    'I was really crying for Vivien,' she said. 'While we were shooting Two, I \par
read a lot about her - she had such a tragic life. And talking about her, right \par
out here between the planets, reminds me of something that Larry said when he \par
brought the poor thing back from Ceylon after her nervous breakdown. He told his \par
friends: "I've married a woman from outer space."\par
\par
    Yva paused for a moment, and another tear trickled (rather theatrically, \par
Floyd could not help thinking) down her cheek.\par
\par
    'And here's something even stranger. She made her last movie exactly a \par
hundred years ago - and do you know what it was?'\par
\par
    'Go on - surprise me again.'\par
\par
    'I expect it will surprise Maggie - if she's really writing the book she \par
keeps threatening us with. Vivien's very last film was - Ship of Fools.'\par

\par
    Now that they had so much unexpected time on their hands, Captain Smith had \par
finally agreed to give Victor Willis the long-delayed interview which was part \par
of his contract. Victor himself had kept putting it off, owing to what \par
Mihailovich persisted in calling his 'amputation'. As it would be many months \par
before he could regenerate his public image, he had finally decided to do the \par
interview off-camera; the studio on Earth could fake him in later with library \par
shots.\par
\par
    They had been sitting in the Captain's still only partly furnished cabin, \par
enjoying one of the excellent wines which apparently made up much of Victor's \par
baggage allowance. As Universe would cut its drive and start coasting within the \par
next few hours, this would be the last opportunity for several days. Weightless \par
wine, Victor maintained, was an abomination; he refused to put any of his \par
precious vintage into plastic squeezebulbs.\par
\par
    'This is Victor Willis, aboard the spaceship Universe at 18.30 on Friday, 15 \par
July 2061. Though we're not yet at the mid-point of our journey, we're already \par
far beyond the orbit of Mars, and have almost reached our maximum velocity. \par
Which is, Captain?'\par
\par
    'One thousand and fifty kilometres a second.'\par
\par
    'More than a thousand kilometres a second -almost four million kilometres an \par
hour!'\par
\par
    Victor Willis' surprise sounded perfectly genuine; no-one would have guessed \par
that he knew the orbital parameters almost as well as did the Captain. But one \par
of his strengths was his ability to put himself in the place of his viewers, and \par
not only to anticipate their questions, but to arouse their interest.\par
\par
    'That's right,' the Captain answered with quiet pride. 'We are travelling \par
twice as fast as any human beings since the beginning of time.'\par
\par
    That should have been one of my lines, thought Victor; he did not like his \par
subject to get ahead of him. But, good professional that he was, he quickly \par
adapted.\par
\par
    He pretended to consult his famous little memo pad, with its sharply \par
directional screen whose display only he could see.\par
\par
    'Every twelve seconds, we're travelling the diameter of Earth. Yet it will \par
still take us another ten days to reach Jupi - ah, Lucifer! That gives some idea \par
of the scale of the Solar System.\par
\par
    'Now, Captain, this is a delicate subject, but I've had a lot of questions \par
about it during the last week.'\par
\par
    Oh no, groaned Smith. Not the zero gravity toilets again!\par
\par
    'At this very moment, we are passing right through the heart of the asteroid \par
belt -'\par
\par
    (I wish it was the toilets, thought Smith...)\par
\par
    '- and though no spaceship has ever been seriously damaged by a collision, \par
aren't we taking quite a risk? After all, there are literally millions of \par
bodies, down to the size of beachballs, orbiting in this section of space. And \par
only a few thousand have been charted.'\par
\par
    'More than a few: over ten thousand.'\par
\par
    'But there are millions we don't know about.'\par
\par
    'That's true; but it wouldn't help us much if we did.'\par
\par
    'What do you mean?'\par
\par
    'There's nothing we can do about them.'\par
\par
    'Why not?'\par
\par
    Captain Smith paused for careful thought. Willis was right - this was indeed \par
a delicate subject; Head Office would rap his knuckles smartly, if he said \par
anything to discourage potential customers.\par
\par
    'First of all, space is so enormous that even here - as you said, right in \par
the heart of the asteroid belt - the chance of collision is - infinitesimal. \par
We've been hoping to show you an asteroid - the best we can do is Hanuman, a \par
miserable three hundred metres across - but the nearest we get to it is a \par
quarter of a million kilometres.'\par
\par
    'But Hanuman is gigantic, compared to all the unknown debris that's floating \par
around out here. Aren't you worried about that?'\par
\par
    'About as worried as you are, at being struck by lightning on Earth.'\par
\par
    'As a matter of fact, I once had a narrow escape, on Pike's Peak in Colorado \par
- the flash and the bang were simultaneous. But you admit that the danger does \par
exist - and aren't we increasing the risk, by the enormous speed at which we're \par
travelling?'\par
\par
    Willis, of course, knew the answer perfectly well; once again he was putting \par
himself in the place of his legions of unknown listeners on the planet that was \par
getting a thousand kilometres further away with every passing second.\par
\par
    'It's hard to explain without mathematics,' said the Captain (how many times \par
he had used that phrase. Even when it wasn't true!), 'but there's no simple \par
relationship between speed and risk. To hit anything at spacecraft velocities \par
would be catastrophic; if you're standing next to an atomic bomb when it goes \par
off, it makes no difference whether it's in the kiloton or megaton class.'\par
\par
    That was not exactly a reassuring statement, but it was the best he could \par
do. Before Willis could press the point further, he continued hastily:\par
\par
    'And let me remind you that any - er - slight extra risk we may be running \par
is in the best of causes. A single hour may save lives.'\par
\par
    'Yes, I'm sure we all appreciate that.' Willis paused; he thought of adding \par
'And, of course, I'm in the same boat', but decided against it. It might sound \par
immodest - not that modesty had ever been his strong suit. And anyway, he could \par
hardly make a virtue of a necessity; he had very little alternative now, unless \par
he decided to walk home.\par
\par
    'All this,' he continued, 'brings me to another point. Do you know what \par
happened just a century and a half ago, on the North Atlantic?'\par
\par
    'In 1911?'\par
\par
    'Well, actually 1912 -'\par
\par
    Captain Smith guessed what was coming, and stubbornly refused to cooperate \par
by pretending ignorance.\par
\par
    'I suppose you mean the Titanic,' he said.\par
\par
    'Precisely,' answered Willis, gamely concealing his disappointment. 'I've \par
had at least twenty reminders from people who think they're the only one who's \par
spotted the parallel.'\par
\par
    'What parallel? The Titanic was running unacceptable risks, merely trying to \par
break a record.'\par
\par
    He almost added 'And she didn't have enough lifeboats', but luckily checked \par
himself in time, when he recalled that the ship's one and only shuttle could \par
carry not more than five passengers. If Willis took him up on that, it would \par
involve altogether too many explanations.\par
\par
    'Well, I grant that the analogy is far-fetched. But there's another striking \par
parallel which everyone points out. Do you happen to know the name of the \par
Titanic's first and last Captain?'\par
\par
    'I haven't the faintest - ' began Captain Smith. Then his jaw dropped.\par
\par
    'Precisely,' said Victor Willis, with a smile which it would be charitable \par
to call smug.\par
\par
    Captain Smith would willingly have strangled all those amateur researchers. \par
But he could hardly blame his parents for bequeathing him the commonest of \par
English names.\par
\par
\par
\par
    39\par
    The Captain's Table\par
\par
\par
\par
    It was a pity that viewers on (and off) Earth could not have enjoyed the \par
less formal discussions aboard Universe. Shipboard life had now settled down to \par
a steady routine, punctuated by a few regular landmarks - of which the most \par
important, and certainly the most long-established, was the traditional \par
'Captain's Table'.\par
\par
    At 18.00 hours exactly, the six passengers, and five of the officers not on \par
duty, would join Captain Smith for dinner. There was, of course, none of the \par
formal dress that had been mandatory aboard the floating palaces of the North \par
Atlantic, but there was usually some attempt at sartorial novelty. Yva could \par
always be relied upon to produce some new brooch, ring, necklace, hair-ribbon, \par
or perfume from an apparently inexhaustible supply.\par
\par
    If the drive was on, the meal would begin with soup; but if the ship was \par
coasting and weightless, there would be a selection of hors-d'oeuvres. In either \par
event, before the main course was served Captain Smith would report the latest \par
news - or try to dispel the latest rumours, usually fuelled by newscasts from \par
Earth or Ganymede.\par
\par
    Accusations and countercharges were flying in all directions, and the most \par
fantastic theories had been proposed to account for Galaxy's hijacking. A finger \par
had been pointed at every secret organization known to exist, and many that were \par
purely imaginary. All the theories, however, had one thing in common. Not one of \par
them could suggest a plausible motive.\par
\par
    The mystery had been compounded by the one fact which had emerged. Strenuous \par
detective work by ASTROPOL had established the surprising fact that the late \par
'Rose McCullen' was really Ruth Mason, born in North London, recruited to the \par
Metropolitan Police - and then, after a promising start, dismissed for racist \par
activities. She had emigrated to Africa - and vanished. Obviously, she had \par
become involved in that unlucky continent's political underground. SHAKA was \par
frequently mentioned, and as frequently denied by the USSA.\par
\par
    What all this could possibly have to do with Europa was endlessly, and \par
fruitlessly, debated around the table - especially when Maggie M confessed that \par
at one time she had been planning a novel about Shaka, from the viewpoint of one \par
of his thousand unfortunate wives. But the more she researched the project, the \par
more repellent it became. 'By the time I abandoned Shaka,' she wryly admitted, \par
'I knew exactly what a modern German feels about Hitler.'\par
\par
    Such personal revelations became more and more common as the voyage \par
proceeded. When the main meal was over, one of the group would be given the \par
floor for thirty minutes. Between them; they had a dozen lifetimes of \par
experience, on as many heavenly bodies, so it would be hard to find a better \par
source of after-dinner tales.\par
\par
    The least effective speaker was, somewhat surprisingly, Victor Willis. He \par
was frank enough to admit it, and to give the reason.\par
\par
    'I'm so used,' he said, almost but not quite apologetically, 'to performing \par
for an audience of millions that I find it hard to interact with a friendly \par
little group like this.'\par
\par
    'Could you do better if it wasn't friendly?' asked Mihailovich, always \par
anxious to be helpful. 'That could easily be arranged.'\par
\par
    Yva, on the other hand, turned out to be better than expected, even though \par
her memories were confined entirely to the world of entertainment. She was \par
particularly good on the famous - and infamous - directors she had worked with, \par
especially David Griffin.\par
\par
    'Was it true,' asked Maggie M, doubtless thinking of Shaka, 'that he hated \par
women?'\par
\par
    'Not at all,' Yva answered promptly. 'He just hated actors. He didn't \par
believe they were human beings.'\par
\par
    Mihailovich's reminiscences also covered a somewhat limited territory - the \par
great orchestras and ballet companies, famous conductors and composers, and \par
their innumerable hangers-on. But he was so full of hilarious stories of \par
backstage intrigues and liaisons, and accounts of sabotaged first nights and \par
mortal feuds among prima donnas, that he kept even his most unmusical listeners \par
convulsed with laughter, and was willingly granted extra time.\par
\par
    Colonel Greenburg's matter-of-fact accounts of extraordinary events could \par
hardly have provided a greater contrast. The first landing at Mercury's - \par
relatively - temperate south pole had been so thoroughly reported that there was \par
little new to be said about it; the question that interested everyone was:\par
\par
    'When will we return?' That was usually followed by: 'Would you like to go \par
back?'\par
\par
    'If they ask me to, of course I'll go,' Greenburg answered. 'But I rather \par
think that Mercury is going to be like the Moon. Remember - we landed there in \par
1969 - and didn't go back again for half a lifetime. Anyway, Mercury isn't as \par
useful as the Moon - though perhaps one day it may be. There's no water there; \par
of course, it was quite a surprise to find any on the Moon. Or I should say in \par
the Moon.\par
\par
    'Though it wasn't as glamorous as landing on Mercury, I did a more important \par
job setting up the Aristarchus Mule-train.'\par
\par
    'Mule-train?'\par
\par
    'Yep. Before the big equatorial launcher was built, and they started \par
shooting the ice straight into orbit, we had to haul it from the pit-head to the \par
Imbrium Spaceport. That meant levelling a road across the lava plains and \par
bridging quite a few crevasses. The Ice Road, we called it - only three hundred \par
kilometres, but it took several lives to build...\par
\par
\par
\par
    'The "mules" were eight-wheeled tractors with huge tyres and independent \par
suspension: they towed up to a dozen trailers, with a hundred tons of ice \par
apiece. Used to travel by night - no need to shield the cargo then.\par
\par
    'I rode with them several times. The trip took about six hours - we weren't \par
out to break speed records - then the ice would be offloaded into big, \par
pressurized tanks, waiting for sunrise. As soon as it melted, it would be pumped \par
into the ships.\par
\par
    'The Ice Road is still there, of course, but only the tourists use it now. \par
If they're sensible, they'll drive by night, as we used to do. It was pure \par
magic, with the full Earth almost directly overhead, so brilliant that we seldom \par
used our own lights. And although we could talk to our friends whenever we \par
wanted to, we often switched off the radio and left it to the automatics to tell \par
them we were OK. We just wanted to be alone, in that great shining emptiness - \par
while it was still there, because we knew it wouldn't last.\par
\par
    'Now they're building the Teravolt quarksmasher, running right around the \par
equator, and domes are going up all over Imbrium and Serenitatis. But we knew \par
the real lunar wilderness, exactly as Armstrong and Aldrin saw it - before you \par
could buy "Wish you were here" cards in the post office at Tranquillity Base.'\par

    Memoirs of a Centenarian\par
\par
\par
\par
    Dr Heywood Floyd preferred not to talk about the first mission to Jupiter, \par
and the second to Lucifer ten years later. It was all so long ago - and there \par
was nothing he had not said a hundred times to Congressional Committees, Space \par
Council boards and media persons like Victor Willis.\par
\par
    Nevertheless, he had a duty to his fellow passengers which could not be \par
avoided. As the only living man to have witnessed the birth of a new sun - and a \par
new solar system - they expected him to have some special understanding of the \par
worlds they were now so swiftly approaching. It was a na\'efve assumption; he could \par
tell them far less about the Galilean satellites than the scientists and \par
engineers who had been working there for more than a generation. When he was \par
asked 'What's it really like on Europa?' (or Ganymede, or Io, or Callisto...) he \par
was liable to refer the enquirer, rather brusquely, to the voluminous reports \par
available in the ship's library.\par
\par
    Yet there was one area where his experience was unique. Half a century \par
later, he sometimes wondered if it had really happened, or whether he had been \par
asleep aboard Discovery when David Bowman had appeared to him. Almost easier to \par
believe that a spaceship could be haunted...\par
\par
    But he could not have been dreaming, when the floating dust motes assembled \par
themselves into that ghostly image of a man who should have been dead for a \par
dozen years. Without the warning it had given him (how clearly he remembered \par
that its lips were motionless, and the voice had come from the console speaker) \par
Leonov and all aboard would have been vaporized in the detonation of Jupiter.\par
\par
    'Why did he do it?' Floyd asked during one of the after-dinner sessions. \par
'I've puzzled over that for fifty years. Whatever he became, after he went out \par
in Discovery's space pod to investigate the monolith, he must still have had \par
some links with the human race; he was not completely alien. We know that he \par
returned to Earth - briefly - because of that orbiting bomb incident. And \par
there's strong evidence that he visited both his mother and his old girlfriend; \par
that's not the action of - of an entity that had discarded all emotions.'\par
\par
    'What do you suppose he is now?' asked Willis. 'For that matter - where is \par
he?'\par
\par
    'Perhaps that last question has no meaning - even for human beings. Do you \par
know where your consciousness resides?'\par
\par
    'I've no use for metaphysics. Somewhere in the general area of my brain, \par
anyway.'\par
\par
    'When I was a young man,' sighed Mihailovich, who had a talent for deflating \par
the most serious discussions, 'mine was about a metre lower down.'\par
\par
    'Let's assume he's on Europa; we know there's a monolith there, and Bowman \par
was certainly associated with it in some way - see how he relayed that warning.'\par
\par
    'Do you think he also relayed the second one, telling us to stay away?'\par
\par
    'Which we are now going to ignore -'\par
\par
    ' in a good cause -' Captain Smith, who was usually content to let the \par
discussion go where it wished, made one of his rare interjections.\par
\par
    'Dr Floyd,' he said thoughtfully, 'you're in a unique position, and we \par
should take advantage of it. Bowman went out of his way to help you once. If \par
he's still around, he may be willing to do so again. I worry a good deal about \par
that ATTEMPT NO LANDINGS HERE order. If he could assure us that it was - \par
temporarily suspended, let's say - I'd be much happier.'\par
\par
    There were several 'hear, hear's around the table before Floyd answered.\par
\par
    'Yes, I've been thinking along the same lines. I've already told Galaxy to \par
watch out for any - let's say manifestations - in case he tries to make \par
contact.'\par
\par
    'Of course,' said Yva, 'he may be dead by now - if ghosts can die.'\par
\par
    Not even Mihailovich had a suitable comment to this, but Yva obviously \par
sensed that no-one thought much of her contribution.\par
\par
    Undeterred, she tried again.\par
\par
    'Woody, dear,' she said. 'Why don't you simply give him a call on the radio? \par
That's what it's for, isn't it?'\par
\par
    The idea had occurred to Floyd, but it had somehow seemed too na\'efve to take \par
seriously.\par
\par
    'I will,' he said. 'I don't suppose it will do any harm.'\par
\par
\par
\par
    42\par
    Minilith\par
\par
\par
\par
    This time, Floyd was quite sure he was dreaming...\par
\par
    He had never been able to sleep well in zero gravity, and Universe was now \par
coasting, unpowered, at maximum velocity. In two days it would start almost a \par
week of steady deceleration, throwing away its enormous excess speed until it \par
was able to rendezvous with Europa.\par
\par
    However many times he adjusted the restraining straps, they always seemed \par
either too tight or too loose. He would have difficulty in breathing - or else \par
he would find himself drifting out of his bunk.\par
\par
    Once he had awoken in mid-air, and had flailed away for several minutes \par
until, exhausted, he had managed to 'swim' the few metres to the nearest wall. \par
Not until then had he remembered that he should merely have waited; the room \par
ventilating system would have soon pulled him to the exhaust grille without any \par
exertion on his part. As a seasoned space-traveller, he knew this perfectly \par
well; his only excuse was simple panic.\par
\par
    But tonight, he had managed to get everything right; probably when weight \par
returned, he would have difficulty in readjusting to that. He had lain awake for \par
only a few minutes, recapitulating the latest discussion at dinner, and had then \par
fallen asleep.\par
\par
    In his dreams, he had continued the conversation around the table. There had \par
been a few trifling changes, which he accepted without surprise. Willis, for \par
example, had grown his beard back - though on only one side of his face. This, \par
Floyd presumed, was in aid of some research project, though he found it \par
difficult to imagine its purpose.\par
\par
    In any event, he had his own worries. He was defending himself against the \par
criticisms of Space Administrator Millson, who had somewhat surprisingly joined \par
their little group. Floyd wondered how he had come aboard Universe (could he \par
possibly have stowed away?). The fact that Millson had been dead for at least \par
forty years seemed much less important.\par
\par
    'Heywood,' his old enemy was saying, 'the White House is most upset.'\par
\par
    'I can't imagine why.'\par
\par
    'That radio message you've just sent to Europa. Did it have State Department \par
clearance?'\par
\par
    'I didn't think it was necessary. I merely asked permission to land.'\par
\par
    'Ah - but that's it. Who did you ask? Do we recognize the government \par
concerned? I'm afraid it's all very irregular...\par
\par
    Millson faded away, still tut-tutting. I'm very glad this is only a dream, \par
thought Floyd. Now what?\par
\par
    Well, I might have expected it. Hello, old friend. You come in all sizes, \par
don't you? Of course, even TMA 1 couldn't have squeezed into my cabin - and its \par
Big Brother could easily have swallowed Universe in one gulp.\par
\par
    The black monolith was standing - or floating - only two metres from his \par
bunk. With an uncomfortable shock of recognition, Floyd realized that it was not \par
only the same shape, but also the same size, as an ordinary tombstone. Although \par
the resemblance had often been pointed out to him, until now the incongruity of \par
scale had lessened the psychological impact. Now, for the first time, he felt \par
the likeness was disquieting - even sinister. I know this is only a dream - but \par
at my age, I don't want any reminders...\par
\par
    Anyway - what are you doing here? Do you bring a message from Dave Bowman? \par
Are you Dave Bowman?\par
\par
    Well, I didn't really expect an answer; you weren't very talkative in the \par
past, were you? But things always happened when you were around. Back in Tycho, \par
sixty years ago, you sent that signal to Jupiter, to tell your makers that we'd \par
dug you up. And look what you did to Jupiter, when we got there a dozen years \par
later!\par
\par
    What are you up to now?\par

    Salvage\par
\par
\par
\par
    The first task confronting Captain Laplace and his crew, once they had grown \par
accustomed to being on terra firma, was to re-orient themselves. Everything on \par
Galaxy was the wrong way round.\par
\par
    Spaceships are designed for two modes of operation - either no gravity at \par
all, or, when the engines are thrusting, an up-and-down direction along the \par
axis. But now Galaxy was lying almost horizontally, and all the floors had \par
become walls. It was exactly as if they were trying to live in a lighthouse that \par
had toppled on to its side; every single piece of furniture had to be moved, and \par
at least fifty per cent of the equipment was not functioning properly.\par
\par
    Yet in some ways this was a blessing in disguise, and Captain Laplace made \par
the most of it. The crew was so busy rearranging Galaxy's interior - giving \par
priority to the plumbing - that he had few worries about morale. As long as the \par
hull remained airtight, and the muon generators continued to supply power, they \par
were in no immediate danger; they merely had to survive for twenty days, and \par
salvation would come from the skies in the shape of Universe. No-one ever \par
mentioned the possibility that the unknown powers that ruled Europa might object \par
to a second landing. They had - as far as anyone knew - ignored the first; \par
surely they could not interfere with a mission of mercy...\par
\par
    Europa itself, however, was now less cooperative. While Galaxy had been \par
adrift on the open sea, it had been virtually unaffected by the quakes which \par
continually racked the little world. But now that the ship had become an all too \par
permanent land structure, it was shaken every few hours by seismic disturbances. \par
Had it touched down in the normal vertical position, by now it would certainly \par
have been overturned.\par
\par
    The quakes were unpleasant rather than dangerous, but they gave nightmares \par
to anyone who had experienced Tokyo '33 or Los Angeles '45. It did not help much \par
to know that they followed a completely predictable pattern, rising to a peak of \par
violence and frequency every three and a half days when Io came swinging past on \par
its inner orbit. Nor was it much consolation to know that Europa's own \par
gravitational tides were inflicting at least equal damage on Io.\par
\par
    After six days of gruelling work, Captain Laplace was satisfied that Galaxy \par
was as near shipshape as was possible in the circumstances. He declared a \par
holiday - which most of the crew spent sleeping - and then drew up a schedule \par
for their second week on the satellite.\par
\par
    The scientists, of course, wanted to explore the new world they had so \par
unexpectedly entered. According to the radar maps that Ganymede had transmitted \par
to them, the island was fifteen kilometres long and five wide; its maximum \par
elevation was only a hundred metres - not high enough, someone had gloomily \par
predicted, to avoid a really bad tsunami.\par
\par
    It was hard to imagine a more dismal and forbidding place; half a century of \par
exposure to Europa's feeble winds and rains had done nothing to break up the \par
pillow lava which covered half its surface, or to soften the outcropping of \par
granite that protruded through the rivers of frozen rock. But it was their home \par
now, and they had to find a name for it.\par
\par
    Gloomy, downbeat suggestions like Hades, Inferno, Hell, Purgatory... were \par
firmly vetoed by the Captain; he wanted something cheerful. One surprising and \par
quixotic tribute to a brave enemy was seriously considered before being rejected \par
thirty-two to ten, with five abstentions: the island would not be called \par
'Roseland'..\par
\par
    In the end, 'Haven' won unanimously.\par
\par
\par
\par
    44\par
    Endurance\par
\par
\par
\par
    'History never repeats itself - but historical situations recur.'\par
\par
    As he made his daily report to Ganymede, Captain Laplace kept thinking of \par
the phrase. It had been quoted by Margaret M'Bala - now approaching at almost a \par
thousand kilometres every second - in a message of encouragement from Universe \par
which he had been very happy to relay to his fellow castaways.\par
\par
    'Please tell Miss M'Bala that her little history lesson was extremely good \par
for morale; she couldn't have thought of anything better to send us.\par
\par
    'Despite the inconvenience of having our walls and floors switched around, \par
we're living in luxury compared to those old polar explorers. Some of us had \par
heard of Ernest Shackleton, but we had no idea of the Endurance saga. To have \par
been trapped on ice floes for over a year - then to spend the Antarctic winter \par
in a cave - then to cross a thousand kilometres of sea in an open boat and to \par
climb a range of unmapped mountains to reach the nearest human settlement!\par
\par
    'And yet that was only the beginning. What we find incredible - and \par
inspiring - is that Shackleton went back four times to rescue his men on that \par
little island - and saved every one of them! You can guess what that story's \par
done to our spirits - I hope you can fax this book to us in your next \par
transmission - we're all anxious to read it.\par
\par
    'And what would he have thought of that! Yes, we're infinitely better off \par
than any of those old-time explorers. It's almost impossible to believe that, \par
until well into the last century, they were completely cut off from the rest of \par
the human race, once they'd gone over the horizon. We should be ashamed at \par
grumbling because light isn't fast enough and we can't talk to our friends in \par
real time - or that it takes a couple of hours to get replies from Earth... They \par
had no contact for months - almost years! Again, Miss M'Bala - our sincerest \par
thanks.\par
\par
    'Of course, all Earth explorers did have one considerable advantage over us; \par
at least they could breathe the air. Our science team has been clamouring to go \par
outside, and we've modified four spacesuits for EVAs of up to six hours. At this \par
atmospheric pressure they won't need full suits - a waist seal is good enough - \par
and I'm allowing two men to go out at a time, as long as they stay within sight \par
of the ship.\par
\par
    'Finally, here's today's weather report. Pressure two hundred and fifty \par
bars, temperature steady at twenty-five degrees, wind gusting at up to thirty \par
klicks from the west, usual hundred per cent overcast, quakes between one and \par
three on open-ended Richter...\par
\par
    'You know, I never did like the sound of that "open-ended" - especially now \par
that Io's coming into conjunction again.\par
\par
\par
\par
    45\par
    Mission\par
\par
\par
\par
    When people asked to see him together, it usually meant trouble, or at least \par
some difficult decision. Captain Laplace had noticed that Floyd and van der Berg \par
were spending a lot of time in earnest discussions, often with Second Officer \par
Chang, and it was easy to guess what they were talking about. Yet their proposal \par
still took him by surprise.\par
\par
    'You want to go to Mount Zeus! How - in an open boat? Has that Shackleton \par
book gone to your head?'\par
\par
    Floyd looked slightly embarrassed; the Captain was right on target. South \par
had been an inspiration, in more ways than one.\par
\par
    'Even if we could build a boat, Sir, it would take much too long... \par
especially now that Universe looks like reaching us within ten days.'\par
\par
    'And I'm not sure,' added van der Berg, 'that I'd care to sail on this "Sea \par
of Galilee"; not all its inhabitants may have got the message that we're \par
inedible.'\par
\par
    'So that leaves only one alternative, doesn't it? I'm sceptical, but I'm \par
willing to be convinced. Go on...\par
\par
    'We've discussed it with Mr Chang, and he confirms that it can be done. \par
Mount Zeus is only three hundred kilometres away; the shuttle can fly there in \par
less than an hour.'\par
\par
    'And find a place to land? As you doubtless recall, Mr Chang wasn't very \par
successful with Galaxy.'\par
\par
    'No problem, Sir, The William Tsung's only a hundredth of our mass; even \par
that ice could probably have supported it. We've been over the video records, \par
and found a dozen good landing sites.'\par
\par
    'Besides,' said van der Berg, 'the pilot won't have a pistol pointed at him. \par
That could help.'\par
\par
    'I'm sure it will. But the big problem is at this end. How are you going to \par
get the shuttle out of its garage? Can you rig a crane? Even in this gravity, it \par
would be quite a load.'\par
\par
    'No need to, Sir. Mr Chang can fly it out.'\par
\par
    There was a prolonged silence while Captain Laplace contemplated, obviously \par
without much enthusiasm, the idea of rocket motors firing inside his ship. The \par
small shuttle William Tsung, more familiarly known as Bill Tee, was designed \par
purely for orbital operations; normally, it would be pushed gently out of its \par
'garage', and the engines would not operate until it was well away from the \par
mother ship.\par
\par
    'Obviously you've worked all this out,' said the Captain grudgingly, 'but \par
what about the angle of take-off? Don't tell me you want to roll Galaxy over so \par
that Bill Tee can pop straight up? The garage is half-way down one side; lucky \par
it wasn't underneath when we grounded.'\par
\par
    'The take-off will have to be at sixty degrees to the horizontal; the \par
lateral thrusters can handle it.'\par
\par
    'If Mr Chang says so, I'll certainly believe him. But what will the firing \par
do to the ship?'\par
\par
    'Well, it will wreck the garage interior - but it will never be used again, \par
anyway. And the bulkheads are designed for accidental explosions, so there's no \par
danger of damage to the rest of the ship. We'll have fire-fighting crews \par
standing by, just in case.'\par
\par
    It was a brilliant concept - no doubt of that. If it worked, the mission \par
would not be a total failure. During the last week, Captain Laplace had given \par
scarcely a moment's thought to the mystery of Mount Zeus, which had brought them \par
to this predicament: only survival had mattered. But now there was hope, and \par
leisure to think ahead. It would be worth taking some risks, to find why this \par
little world was the focus of so much intrigue.\par
\par
\par
\par
    46\par
    Shuttle\par
\par
\par
\par
     'Speaking from memory,' said Dr Anderson, 'Goddard's first rocket flew \par
about fifty metres. I wonder if Mr Chang will beat that record?'\par
\par
    'He'd better - or we'll all be in trouble.'\par
\par
    Most of the science team had gathered in the observation lounge, and \par
everyone was staring anxiously back along the hull of the ship. Although the \par
entrance of the 'garage' was not visible from this angle, they would see the \par
Bill Tee soon enough, when - and if - it emerged.\par
\par
    There was no countdown; Chang was taking his time, making every possible \par
check - and would fire when he felt like it. The shuttle had been stripped down \par
to its minimum mass, and was carrying just enough propellant for one hundred \par
seconds of flight. If everything worked, that would be ample; if it didn't, more \par
would not only be superfluous, but dangerous.\par
\par
    'Here we go,' said Chang casually.\par
\par
    It was almost like a conjuring trick; everything happened so quickly that \par
the eye was deceived. No one saw Bill Tee pop out of the garage, because it was \par
hidden in a cloud of steam. When the cloud had cleared, the shuttle was already \par
landing, two hundred metres away.\par
\par
    A great cheer of relief echoed through the lounge.\par
\par
    'He did it!' cried ex-Acting Captain Lee. 'He's broken Goddard's record - \par
easily!'\par
\par
    Standing on its four stubby legs in the bleak Europan landscape, Bill Tee \par
looked like a larger and even less elegant version of an Apollo lunar module. \par
That was not, however, the thought that occurred to Captain Laplace, as he \par
looked out from the bridge. It seemed to him that his ship was rather like a \par
stranded whale, that had managed a difficult birth in an alien element. He hoped \par
that the new calf would survive.\par
\par
\par
\par
    Forty-eight very busy hours later, the William Tsung was loaded, checked out \par
on a ten-kilometre circuit over the island - and ready to go. There was still \par
plenty of time for the mission; by the most optimistic reckoning, Universe could \par
not arrive for another three days, and the trip to Mount Zeus, even allowing for \par
the deployment of Dr van der Berg's extensive array of instruments, would take \par
only six hours.\par
\par
    As soon as Second Officer Chang had landed, Captain Laplace called him to \par
his cabin. The Skipper looked, thought Chang, somewhat ill at ease.\par
\par
    'Good work, Walter - but of course that's only what we expect.'\par
\par
    'Thanks, Sir, So what's the problem?'\par
\par
    The Captain smiled. A well-integrated crew could keep no secrets.\par
\par
    'Head Office, as usual. I hate to disappoint you, but I've had orders that \par
only Dr van der Berg and Second Officer Floyd are to make the trip.'\par
\par
    'I get the picture,' Chang answered, with a trace of bitterness. 'What have \par
you told them?'\par
\par
    'Nothing, yet; that's why I wanted to talk to you. I'm quite prepared to say \par
that you're the only pilot who can fly the mission.'\par
\par
    'They'll know that's nonsense; Floyd could do the job as well as I could. \par
There's not the slightest risk - except for a malfunction, which could happen to \par
anyone.'\par
\par
    'I'd still be willing to stick my neck out, if you insist. After all, no-one \par
can stop me - and we'll all be heroes when we get back to Earth.'\par
\par
    Chang was obviously doing some intricate calculations. He seemed rather \par
pleased with the result.\par
\par
    'Replacing a couple of hundred kilos of payload with propellant gives us an \par
interesting new option; I'd intended to mention it earlier, but there was no way \par
Bill Tee could manage with all that extra gear and a full crew...'\par
\par
    'Don't tell me. The Great Wall.'\par
\par
    'Of course; we could do a complete survey in one or two passes, and find \par
what it really is.'\par
\par
    'I thought we had a very good idea, and I'm not sure if we should go near \par
it. That might be pressing our luck.'\par
\par
    'Perhaps. But there's another reason; to some of us, it's an even better \par
one...'\par
\par
    'Go on.'\par
\par
    'Tsien. It's only ten kilometres from the Wall. We'd like to drop a wreath \par
there.'\par
\par
    So that was what his officers had been discussing so solemnly; not for the \par
first time, Captain Laplace wished he knew a little more Mandarin.\par
\par
    'I understand,' he said quietly. 'I'll have to think it over - and talk to \par
van der Berg and Floyd to see if they agree.'\par
\par
    'And Head Office?'\par
\par
    'No, dammit. This will be my decision.'\par
\par
\par
\par
    47\par
    Shards\par
\par
\par
\par
    'You'd better hurry,' Ganymede Central had advised, 'The next conjunction \par
will be a bad one - we'll be triggering quakes as well as Io. And we don't want \par
to scare you - but unless our radar's gone crazy, your mountain's sunk another \par
hundred metres since the last check.'\par
\par
    At that rate, thought van der Berg, Europa will be flat again in ten years. \par
How much faster things happened here than on Earth; which was one reason why the \par
place was so popular with geologists.\par
\par
    Now that he was strapped into the number two position immediately behind \par
Floyd, and virtually surrounded by consoles of his own equipment, he felt a \par
curious mixture of excitement and regret. In a few hours, the great intellectual \par
adventure of his life would be over - one way or the other. Nothing that would \par
ever happen again could possibly match it.\par
\par
    He did not have the slightest trace of fear; his confidence in both man and \par
machine was complete. One unexpected emotion was a wry sense of gratitude to the \par
late Rose McCullen; without her, he would never have had this opportunity, but \par
might have gone, still uncertain, to his grave.\par
\par
    The heavily laden Bill Tee could barely manage one-tenth of a gravity at \par
lift-off; it was not intended for this sort of work, but would manage much \par
better on the homeward journey when it had deposited its cargo. It seemed to \par
take ages to climb clear of Galaxy, and they had ample time to note the damage \par
to the hull as well as signs of corrosion from the occasional mildly acid rains. \par
While Floyd concentrated on the lift-off, van der Berg gave a quick report on \par
the ship's condition from the viewpoint of a privileged observer. It seemed the \par
right thing to do - even though, with any luck, Galaxy's space-worthiness would \par
soon be of no further concern to anyone.\par
\par
    Now they could see the whole of Haven spread out beneath them, and van der \par
Berg realized what a brilliant job Acting Captain Lee had done when he beached \par
the ship. There were only a few places where it could have been safely grounded; \par
although a good deal of luck had also been involved, Lee had used wind and sea-\par
anchor to the best possible advantage.\par
\par
    The mists closed around them; Bill Tee was rising on a semi-ballistic \par
trajectory to minimize drag, and there would be nothing to see except the clouds \par
for twenty minutes. A pity, thought van der Berg; I'm sure there must be some \par
interesting creatures swimming around down there, and no-one else may have a \par
chance of seeing them.\par
\par
    'Coming up to engine cut-off,' said Floyd. 'Everything normal.'\par
\par
    'Very good, Bill Tee. No report of traffic at your altitude. You're still \par
number one on the runway to land.'\par
\par
    'Who's that joker?' asked van der Berg.\par
\par
    'Ronnie Lim. Believe it or not, that "number one on the runway" goes back to \par
Apollo.'\par
\par
    Van der Berg could understand why. There was nothing like the occasional \par
touch of humour - providing it was not overdone - to relieve the strain when men \par
were involved in some complex and possibly hazardous enterprise.\par
\par
    'Fifteen minutes before we start braking,' said Floyd. 'Let's see who else \par
is on the air.'\par
\par
    He started the autoscan, and a succession of beeps and whistles, separated \par
by short silences as the tuner rejected them one by one in its swift climb up \par
the radio spectrum, echoed round the little cabin.\par
\par
    'Your local beacons and data transmissions,' said Floyd. 'I was hoping - ah, \par
here we are!'\par
\par
    It was only a faint musical tone, warbling rapidly up and down like a \par
demented soprano. Floyd glanced at the frequency meter.\par
\par
    'Doppler shift almost gone - she's slowing fast.'\par
\par
    'What is it -text?'\par
\par
    'Slowscan video, I think. They're relaying a lot of material back to Earth \par
through the big dish on Ganymede, when it's in the right position. The networks \par
are yelling for news.'\par
\par
    They listened to the hypnotic but meaningless sound for a few minutes; then \par
Floyd switched it off. Incomprehensible though the transmission from Universe \par
was to their unaided senses, it conveyed the only message that mattered. Help \par
was on the way, and would soon be there.\par
\par
    Partly to fill the silence, but also because he was genuinely interested, \par
van der Berg remarked casually: 'Have you talked to your grandfather lately?'\par
\par
    'Talked', of course, was a misnomer where interplanetary distances were \par
concerned, but no-one had come up with an acceptable alternative. 'Voicegram', \par
'audiomail' and 'vocard' had all flourished briefly, then vanished into limbo. \par
Even now, most of the human race probably did not believe that realtime \par
conversation was impossible in the Solar System's wide, open spaces, and from \par
time to time indignant protests were heard: 'Why can't you scientists do \par
something about it?'\par
\par
    'Yes,' said Floyd. 'He's in fine shape, and I look forward to meeting him.'\par
\par
    There was a slight strain in his voice. I wonder, thought van der Berg, when \par
they last met; but he realized that it would be tactless to ask. Instead, he \par
spent the next ten minutes rehearsing the off-loading and setting-up procedures \par
with Floyd, so there would be no unnecessary confusion when they touched down.\par
\par
    The COMMENCE BRAKING alarm went off just a fraction of a second after Floyd \par
had already started the program sequencer. I'm in good hands, thought van der \par
Berg: I can relax and concentrate on my job. Where's that camera - don't say \par
it's floated away again.\par
\par
    The clouds were clearing. Even though the radar had shown exactly what was \par
beneath them, in a display as good as normal vision could provide, it was still \par
a shock to see the face of the mountain rearing up only a few kilometres ahead.\par
\par
    'Look!' cried Floyd suddenly. 'Over to the left -by that double peak - give \par
you one guess!'\par
\par
    'I'm sure you're right - I don't think we did any damage - it just \par
splattered - wonder where the other one hit-'\par
\par
    'Altitude one thousand. Which landing site? Alpha doesn't look so good from \par
here.'\par
\par
    'You're right - try Gamma - closer to the mountain, anyway.'\par
\par
    'Five hundred. Gamma it is. I'll hover for twenty secs - if you don't like \par
it, we'll switch to Beta. Four hundred... Three hundred... Two hundred. ('Good \par
luck, Bill Tee,' said Galaxy briefly). Thanks, Ronnie... One hundred and \par
fifty... One hundred... Fifty... How about it? Just a few small rocks, and - \par
that's peculiar - what looks like broken glass all over the place - someone's \par
had a wild party here... Fifty... Fifty... Still OK?'\par
\par
    'Perfect. Go down.'\par
\par
    'Forty... thirty... twenty... Sure you don't want to change your mind?... \par
Ten... Kicking up a little dust, as Neil said once - or was it Buzz?... Five... \par
Contact! Easy, wasn't it? Don't know why they bother to pay me.'\par
\par
\par
\par

    Lucy\par
\par
\par
\par
    'Hello, Gany Central - we've made a perfect landing - I mean Chris has - on \par
a flat surface of some metamorphic rock - probably the same pseudogranite we've \par
called Havenite. The base of the mountain is only two kilometres away, but \par
already I can tell there's no real need to go any closer.\par
\par
    'We're putting on our top-suits now, and will start unloading in five \par
minutes. Will leave the monitors running, of course, and will call on every \par
quarter-hour. Van out.'\par
\par
    'What did you mean by that "no need to go any closer"?' asked Floyd.\par
\par
    Van der Berg grinned. In the last few minutes he seemed to have shed years, \par
and almost to have become a carefree boy.\par
\par
    'Circumspice,' he said happily. 'Latin for "look around you". Let's get the \par
big camera out first - wow!'\par
\par
    The Bill Tee gave a sudden lurch, and for a moment heaved up and down on its \par
landing-gear shock absorbers with a motion that, if it had continued for more \par
than a few seconds, would have been a recipe for instant sea sickness.\par
\par
    'Ganymede was right about those quakes,' said Floyd, when they had \par
recovered. 'Is there any serious danger?'\par
\par
    'Probably not; it's still thirty hours to conjunction, and this looks a \par
solid slab of rock. But we won't waste any time here - luckily we won't need to. \par
Is my mask straight? It doesn't feel right.'\par
\par
    'Let me tighten the strap. That's better. Breathe in hard - good, now it \par
fits fine. I'll go first.'\par
\par
    Van der Berg wished that his could be the first small step, but Floyd was \par
the commander and it was his duty to check that the Bill Tee was in good shape - \par
and ready for an immediate take-off.\par
\par
    He walked once around the little spacecraft, examining the landing gear, \par
then gave the thumbs-up signal to van der Berg, who started down the ladder to \par
join him. Although he had worn the same lightweight breathing equipment on his \par
exploration of Haven, he felt a little awkward with it, and paused at the \par
landing pad to make some adjustments. Then he glanced up - and saw what Floyd \par
was doing.\par
\par
    'Don't touch it!' he cried. 'It's dangerous!'\par
\par
    Floyd jumped a good metre away from the shards of vitreous rock he was \par
examining. To his untrained eye, they looked rather like an unsuccessful melt \par
from a large glass furnace.\par
\par
    'It's not radioactive, is it?' he asked anxiously. 'No. But stay away until \par
I've got there.'\par
\par
    To his surprise, Floyd realized that van der Berg was wearing heavy gloves. \par
As a space officer, it had taken him a long time to grow accustomed to the fact \par
that, here on Europa, it was safe to expose one's bare skin to the atmosphere. \par
Nowhere else in the Solar System - even on Mars - was that possible.\par
\par
    Very cautiously, van der Berg reached down and picked up a long splinter of \par
the glassy material. Even in this diffused light, it glittered strangely, and \par
Floyd could see that it had a vicious edge.\par
\par
    'The sharpest knife in the known universe,' said van der Berg happily.\par
\par
    'We've been through all this to find a knife!'\par
\par
    Van der Berg started to laugh, then found it wasn't easy inside his mask.\par
\par
    'So you still don't know what this is about?'\par
\par
    'I'm beginning to feel I'm the only one who doesn't.'\par
\par
    Van der Berg took his companion by the shoulder, and turned him to face the \par
looming mass of Mount Zeus. From this distance, it filled half the sky - not \par
merely the greatest, but the only mountain on this whole world.\par
\par
    'Admire the view just for one minute. I have an important call to make.'\par
\par
    He punched a code sequence on his comset, waited for the READY light to \par
flash, and said: 'Ganymede Central 109 - this is Van. Do you receive?'\par
\par
    After no more than the minimum timelag, an obviously electronic voice \par
answered:\par
\par
    'Hello, Van. This is Ganymede Central 109. Ready to receive.'\par
\par
    Van der Berg paused, savouring the moment he would remember for the rest of \par
his life.\par
\par
    'Contact Earth Ident Uncle 737. Relay following message. LUCY IS HERE. LUCY \par
IS HERE. End message. Please repeat.'\par
\par
    Perhaps I should have stopped him saying that, whatever it means, thought \par
Floyd, as Ganymede repeated the message. But it's too late now. It will reach \par
Earth within the hour.\par
\par
    'Sorry about that, Chris,' grinned van der Berg. 'I wanted to establish \par
priority - amongst other things.'\par
\par
    'Unless you start talking soon, I'll begin carving you up with one of these \par
patent glass knives.'\par
\par
    'Glass, indeed! Well, the explanation can wait - it's absolutely \par
fascinating, but quite complicated. So I'll give you the straight facts.\par
\par
    'Mount Zeus is a single diamond, approximate mass one million million tons. \par
Or, if you prefer it that way, about two times ten to the seventeenth carats. \par
But I can't guarantee that it's all gem quality.'\par
\par
\par
\par
    VII\par
    THE GREAT WALL\par
\par
\par
\par
    49\par
    Shrine\par
\par
\par
\par
    As they unloaded the equipment from Bill Tee and set it up on their little \par
granite landing-pad, Chris Floyd found it hard to tear his eyes away from the \par
mountain looming above them. A single diamond - bigger than Everest! Why, the \par
scattered fragments lying round the shuttle must be worth billions, rather than \par
millions.\par
\par
    On the other hand, they might be worth no more than - well, scraps of broken \par
glass. The value of diamonds had always been controlled by the dealers and \par
producers, but if a literal gem-mountain came suddenly on the market, prices \par
would obviously collapse completely. Now Floyd began to understand why so many \par
interested parties had focused their attention upon Europa; the political and \par
economic ramifications were endless.\par
\par
    Now that he had at last proved his theory, van der Berg had become again the \par
dedicated and single-minded scientist, anxious to complete his experiment with \par
no further distraction. With Floyd's help - it was not easy to get some of the \par
bulkier pieces of equipment out of Bill Tee's cramped cabin - they first drilled \par
a metre-long core with a portable electric drill, and carried it carefully back \par
to the shuttle.\par
\par
    Floyd would have had a different set of priorities, but he recognized that \par
it made sense to do the harder tasks first. Not until they had laid out a \par
seismograph array and erected a panoramic TV camera on a low, heavy tripod did \par
van der Berg condescend to collect some of the incomputable riches lying all \par
around them.\par
\par
    'At the very least,' he said, as he carefully selected some of the less \par
lethal fragments, 'they'll make good souvenirs.'\par
\par
    'Unless Rosie's friends murder us to get them.'\par
\par
    Van der Berg looked sharply at his companion; he wondered how much Chris \par
really knew - and how much, like all of them, he was guessing.\par
\par
    'Not worth their while, now that the secret's out. In about an hour's time, \par
the Stock Exchange computers will be going crazy.'\par
\par
    'You bastard!' said Floyd, with admiration rather than rancour. 'So that's \par
what your messsage was about.'\par
\par
    'There's no law that says a scientist shouldn't make a little profit on the \par
side - but I'm leaving the sordid details to my friends on Earth. Honestly, I'm \par
much more interested in the job we're doing here. Let me have that wrench, \par
please...'\par
\par
    Three times before they had finished establishing Zeus Station they were \par
almost knocked off their feet by quakes. They could feel them first as a \par
vibration underfoot, then everything would start shaking - then there would be a \par
horrible, long-drawn-out groaning sound that seemed to come from every \par
direction. It was even air-borne, which to Floyd seemed strangest of all. He \par
could not quite get used to the fact that there was enough atmosphere around \par
them to allow short-range conversations without radio.\par
\par
    Van der Berg kept assuring him that the quakes were still quite harmless, \par
but Floyd had learned never to put too much trust in experts. True, the \par
geologist had just been proved spectacularly right; as he looked at Bill Tee \par
heaving on its shock-absorbers like a storm-tossed ship, he hoped that Van's \par
luck would hold for at least a few more minutes.\par
\par
    'That seems to be it,' said the scientist at last, to Floyd's great relief. \par
'Ganymede's getting good data on all channels. The batteries will last for \par
years, with the solar panel to keep recharging them.'\par
\par
    'If this gear is still standing a week from now, I'll be very surprised. \par
I'll swear that mountain's moved since we landed - let's get off before it falls \par
on top of us.'\par
\par
    'I'm more worried,' laughed van der Berg, 'that your jet-blast will undo all \par
our work.'\par
\par
    'No risk of that - we're well clear, and now we've offloaded so much junk \par
we'll need only half-power to lift. Unless you want to take aboard a few more \par
billions. Or trillions.'\par
\par
    'Let's not be greedy. Anyway, I can't even guess what this will be worth \par
when we get it to Earth. The museums will grab most of it, of course. After that \par
- who knows?'\par
\par
    Floyd's fingers were flying over the control panel as he exchanged messages \par
with Galaxy.\par
\par
    'First stage of mission completed. Bill Tee ready for take-off. Flight plan \par
as agreed.'\par
\par
    They were not surprised when Captain Laplace answered.\par
\par
    'You're quite certain you want to go ahead? Remember, you have the final \par
decision. I'll back you up, whatever it is.'\par
\par
    'Yessir, we're both happy. We understand how the crew feels. And the \par
scientific payoff could be enormous - we're both very excited.'\par
\par
    'Just a minute - we're still waiting for your report on Mount Zeus!'\par
\par
    Floyd looked at van der Berg, who shrugged his shoulders and then took the \par
microphone.\par
\par
    'If we told you now, Captain, you'd think we were crazy - or pulling your \par
leg. Please wait a couple of hours until we're back - with the evidence.'\par
\par
    'Hm. Not much point giving you an order, is it? Anyway - good luck. And from \par
the owner as well - he thinks going to Tsien is a splendid idea.'\par
\par
    'I knew Sir Lawrence would approve,' Floyd remarked to his companion. 'And \par
anyway - with Galaxy already a total loss, Bill Tee's not much extra risk, is \par
it?'\par
\par
    Van der Berg could see his point of view, even though he did not entirely \par
subscribe to it. He had made his scientific reputation; but he still looked \par
forward to enjoying it.\par
\par
    'Oh - by the way,' Floyd said. 'Who was Lucy - anybody in particular?'\par
\par
    'Not as far as I know. We came across her in a computer search, and decided \par
the name would make a good code word - everyone would assume it was something to \par
do with Lucifer, which is just enough of a half-truth to be beautifully \par
misleading....\par
\par
    'I'd never heard of them, but a hundred years ago there was a group of \par
popular musicians with a very strange name - the Beatles - spelled B-E-A-T-L-E-\par
S, don't ask me why. And they wrote a song with an equally strange title: "Lucy \par
in the Sky with Diamonds". Weird, isn't it? Almost as if they knew...'\par
\par
\par
\par
    According to Ganymede radar, the wreck of the Tsien lay three hundred \par
kilometres west of Mount Zeus, towards the twilight zone and the cold lands \par
beyond. Permanently cold they were, but not dark; half the time they were \par
brilliantly lit by the distant Sun. However, even by the end of the long Europan \par
solar day, the temperature was still far below freezing point. As liquid water \par
could exist only on the hemisphere facing Lucifer, the intermediate region was a \par
place of continual storms, where rain and hail, sleet and snow contended for \par
supremacy.\par
\par
    During the half-century since Tsien's disastrous landing, the ship had moved \par
almost a thousand kilometres. It must have drifted - like Galaxy - for several \par
years on the newly created Sea of Galilee, before coming to rest on its bleakly \par
inhospitable shore.\par
\par
    Floyd picked up the radar echo as soon as Bill Tee flattened out at the end \par
of its second leap across Europa. The signal was surprisingly weak for so large \par
an object; as soon as they broke through the clouds, they realized why.\par
\par
    The wreck of the spaceship Tsien, first man-carrying vessel to land on a \par
satellite of Jupiter, stood in the centre of a small, circular lake - obviously \par
artificial, and connected by a canal to the sea, less than three kilometres \par
away. Only the skeleton was left, and not even all of that; the carcass had been \par
picked clean.\par
\par
    But by what? van der Berg asked. There was no sign of life there; the place \par
looked as if it had been deserted for years. Yet he had not the slightest doubt \par
that something had stripped the wreck, with deliberate and indeed almost \par
surgical precision.\par
\par
    'Obviously safe to land,' said Floyd, waiting for a few seconds to get van \par
der Berg's almost absentminded nod of approval. The geologist was already \par
videoing everything in sight.\par
\par
    Bill Tee settled down effortlessly by the side of the pool, and they looked \par
across the cold, dark water at this monument to man's exploring impulses. There \par
seemed no convenient way of getting to the wreck, but that did not really \par
matter.\par
\par
    When they had suited up, they carried the wreath to the water's edge, held \par
it solemnly for a moment in front of the camera, then tossed in this tribute \par
from Galaxy's crew. It had been beautifully made; even though the only raw \par
materials available were metal foil, paper and plastic, one could easily believe \par
that the flowers and leaves were real. Pinned all over them were notes and \par
inscriptions, many written in the ancient but now officially obsolete script \par
rather than Roman characters.\par
\par
    As they were walking back to the Bill Tee, Floyd said thoughtfully: 'Did you \par
notice - there was practically no metal left. Only glass, plastic, synthetics.'\par
\par
    'What about those ribs and supporting girders?'\par
\par
    'Composite - mostly carbon, boron. Someone round here is very hungry for \par
metal - and knows it when it sees it. Interesting...'\par
\par
    Very, thought van der Berg. On a world where fire could not exist, metals \par
and alloys would be almost impossible to make, and as precious as - well, \par
diamonds.\par
\par
    When he had reported to base, and received a message of gratitude from \par
Second Officer Chang and his colleagues, Floyd took the Bill Tee up to a \par
thousand metres and continued westward.\par
\par
    'Last lap,' he said, 'no point in going higher - we'll be there in ten \par
minutes. But I won't land; if the Great Wall is what we think it is, I'd prefer \par
not to. We'll do a quick flyby and head for home. Get those cameras ready; this \par
could be even more important than Mount Zeus.'\par
\par
    And, he added to himself, I may soon know what Grandfather Heywood felt, not \par
so far from here, fifty years ago. We'll have a lot to talk about when we meet - \par
less than a week from now, if all goes well.\par
\par
\par
\par
    50\par
    Open City\par
\par
\par
\par
    What a terrible place, thought Chris Floyd - nothing but driving sleet, \par
flurries of snow, occasional glimpses of landscapes streaked with ice - why, \par
Haven was a tropical paradise by comparison! Yet he knew that the nightside, \par
only a few hundred kilometres further on round the curve of Europa, was even \par
worse.\par
\par
    To his surprise, the weather cleared suddenly and completely just before \par
they reached their goal. The clouds lifted - and there ahead was an immense, \par
black wall, almost a kilometre high, lying directly across Bill Tee's flight \par
path. It was so huge that it was obviously creating its own microclimate; the \par
prevailing winds were being deflected around it, leaving a local, calm area in \par
its lee.\par
\par
    It was instantly recognizable as the Monolith, and sheltering at its foot \par
were hundreds of hemispherical structures, gleaming a ghostly white in the rays \par
of the low-hanging sun that had once been Jupiter. They looked, thought Floyd, \par
exactly like old-style beehives made of snow; something in their appearance \par
evoked other memories of Earth. Van der Berg was one jump ahead of him.\par
\par
    'Igloos,' he said. 'Same problem - same solution. No other building material \par
around here, except rock - which would be much harder to work. And the low \par
gravity must help - some of those domes are quite large. I wonder what lives in \par
them...'\par
\par
    They were still too far away to see anything moving in the streets of this \par
little city at the edge of the world. And as they came closer, they saw that \par
there were no streets.\par
\par
    'It's Venice, made of ice,' said Floyd. 'All igloos and canals.'\par
\par
    'Amphibians,' answered van der Berg. 'We should have expected it. I wonder \par
where they are?'\par
\par
    'We may have scared them. Bill Tee's much noisier outside than in.'\par
\par
    For a moment, van der Berg was too busy filming and reporting to Galaxy to \par
reply. Then he said: 'We can't possibly leave without making some contact. \par
You're right - this is far bigger than Mount Zeus.'\par
\par
    'And it could be more dangerous.'\par
\par
    'I don't see any sign of advanced technology - correction, that looks like \par
an old twentieth-century radar dish over there! Can you get closer?'\par
\par
    'And get shot at? No thanks. Besides, we're using up our hover time. Only \par
another ten minutes - if you want to get home again.'\par
\par
    'Can we at least land and look around? There's a patch of clear rock over \par
there. Where the hell is everybody?'\par
\par
    'Scared, like me. Nine minutes. I'll do one trip across town - film \par
everything you can - yes, Galaxy - we're OK - just rather busy at the moment - \par
call you later -'\par
\par
    'I've just realized - that's not a radar dish, but something almost as \par
interesting. It's pointing straight at Lucifer - it's a solar furnace! Makes a \par
lot of sense in a place where the sun never moves - and you can't light a fire.'\par
\par
    'Eight minutes. Too bad everyone's hiding indoors.'\par
\par
    'Or back in the water. Can we look at that big building with the open space \par
around it? I think it's the town hall.'\par
\par
    Van der Berg was pointing towards a structure much larger than all the \par
others, and of quite different design; it was a collection of vertical \par
cylinders, like oversized organ-pipes. Moreover, it was not the featureless \par
white of the igloos, but showed a complex mottling over its entire surface.\par
\par
    'Europan art!' cried van der Berg. 'That's a mural of some kind! Closer, \par
closer! We must get a record!'\par
\par
    Obediently, Floyd dropped lower - and lower - and lower. He seemed to have \par
completely forgotten all his earlier reservations about hover time; and \par
suddenly, with shocked incredulity, van der Berg realized that he was going to \par
land.\par
\par
    The scientist tore his eyes from the rapidly approaching ground, and glanced \par
at his pilot. Though he was obviously still in full control of Bill Tee, Floyd \par
seemed to be hypnotized; he was staring at a fixed point straight ahead of the \par
descending shuttle.\par
\par
    'What's the matter, Chris?' van der Berg cried. 'Do you know what you're \par
doing?'\par
\par
    'Of course. Can't you see him?'\par
\par
    'See who?'\par
\par
    'That man, standing by the biggest cylinder. And he's not wearing any \par
breathing gear!'\par
\par
    'Don't be an idiot, Chris: there's no one there.'\par
\par
    'He's looking up at us. He's waving - I think I recog - Oh my God!'\par
\par
    'There's no-one - no-one! Pull up!'\par
\par
    Floyd ignored him completely. He was absolutely calm and professional as he \par
brought Bill Tee in to a perfect landing, and cut the motor at exactly the right \par
instant before touchdown.\par
\par
    Very thoroughly, he checked the instrument readings, and set the safety \par
switches. Only when he had completed the landing sequence did he again look out \par
of the observation window, with a puzzled but happy expression on his face.\par
\par
    'Hello, Grandfather,' he said softly, to no-one at all that van der Berg \par
could see.\par
\par
\par
\par
    51\par
    Phantom\par
\par
\par
\par
    Even in his most horrible nightmares, Dr van der Berg had never imagined \par
being stranded on a hostile world in a tiny space capsule, with only a madman \par
for company. But at least Chris Floyd did not seem to be violent; perhaps he \par
could be humoured into taking off again and flying them safely back to Galaxy...\par
\par
    He was still staring at nothing, and from time to time his lips moved in \par
silent conversation. The alien 'town' remained completely deserted, and one \par
could almost imagine that it had been abandoned for centuries. Presently, \par
however, van der Berg noticed some tell-tale signs of recent occupancy. Although \par
Bill Tee's rockets had blasted away the thin layer of snow immediately around \par
them, the remainder of the little square was still lightly powdered. It was a \par
page torn from a book, covered with signs and hieroglyphics, some of which he \par
could read.\par
\par
    A heavy object had been dragged in that direction - or had made its way \par
clumsily under its own power. Leading from the now closed entrance of one igloo \par
was the unmistakable track of a wheeled vehicle. Too far away to make out \par
details was a small object that could have been a discarded container; perhaps \par
Europans were sometimes as careless as humans...\par
\par
    The presence of life was unmistakable, overwhelming. Van der Berg felt he \par
was being watched by a thousand eyes - or other senses - and there was no way of \par
guessing whether the minds behind them were friendly, or hostile. They might \par
even be indifferent, merely waiting for the intruders to go away, so that they \par
could continue their interrupted and mysterious business.\par
\par
    Then Chris Floyd spoke once again into the empty air.\par
\par
    'Goodbye, Grandfather,' he said quietly, with just a trace of sadness. \par
Turning towards van der Berg he added in a normal conversational tone: 'He says \par
it's time to leave. I guess you must think I'm crazy.'\par
\par
    It was wisest, decided van der Berg, not to agree. In any event, he soon had \par
something else to worry about.\par
\par
    Floyd was now staring anxiously at the read-outs that Bill Tee's computer \par
was feeding to him. Presently he said, in an understandable tone of apology:\par
\par
    'Sorry about this, Van. That landing used up more fuel than I'd intended. \par
We'll have to change the mission profile.'\par
\par
    That, van der Berg thought bleakly, was a rather roundabout way of saying: \par
'We can't get back to Galaxy.' With difficulty, he. managed to suppress a 'Damn \par
your grandfather!' and merely asked: 'So what do we do?'\par
\par
    Floyd was studying the chart, and punching in more numbers.\par
\par
    'We can't stay here -, (Why not? thought van der Berg. If we're going to die \par
anyway, we might use our time learning as much as possible.) ' - so we should \par
find a place where the shuttle from Universe can pick us up easily.'\par
\par
    Van der Berg breathed a huge mental sigh of relief. Stupid of him not to \par
have thought of that; he felt like a man who had been reprieved just when he was \par
being taken to the gallows. Universe should reach Europa in less than four days; \par
Bill Tee's accommodation could hardly be called luxurious, but it was infinitely \par
preferable to most of the alternatives he could imagine.\par
\par
    'Away from this filthy weather - a stable, flat surface - closer to Galaxy, \par
though I'm not sure if that helps much - shouldn't be any problem. We've enough \par
for five hundred kilometres - it's just that we can't risk the sea crossing.'\par
\par
    For a moment, van der Berg thought wistfully of Mount Zeus; there was so \par
much that could be done there. But the seismic disturbances - steadily getting \par
worse as lo came into line with Lucifer - ruled that out completely. He wondered \par
if his instruments were still working, and would check them again as soon as \par
they'd dealt with the immediate problem.\par
\par
    'I'll fly down the coast to the equator - best place to be anyway for a \par
shuttle landing - the radar map showed some smooth areas just inland round sixty \par
west.'\par
\par
    'I know. The Masada Plateau.' (And, van der Berg added to himself, perhaps a \par
chance for a little more exploring. Never miss an unexpected opportunity...)\par
\par
    'The Plateau it is. Goodbye, Venice. Goodbye, Grandfather...'\par
\par
    * * *\par
\par
\par
\par
    When the muted roar of the braking rockets had died away, Chris Floyd \par
safetied the firing circuits for the last time, released his seat belt, and \par
stretched arms and legs as far as he could in Bill Tee's confined quarters.\par
\par
    'Not such a bad view - for Europa,' he said cheerfully. 'Now we've four days \par
to find out if shuttle rations are as bad as they claim. So - which of us starts \par
talking first?'\par
\par
\par
\par
    52\par
    On the Couch\par
\par
\par
\par
    I wish I'd studied some psychology, thought van der Berg; then I could \par
explore the parameters of his delusion. Yet now he seems completely sane - \par
except on that one subject.\par
\par
    Though almost any seat was comfortable at one-sixth of a gravity, Floyd had \par
tilted his to the fully reclining position and had clasped his hands behind his \par
head. Van der Berg suddenly recalled that this was the classic position of a \par
patient, in the days of the old and still not entirely discredited Freudian \par
analysis.\par
\par
    He was glad to let the other talk first, partly out of sheer curiosity but \par
chiefly because he hoped that the sooner Floyd got this nonsense out of his \par
system, the sooner he would be cured - or, at least, harmless. But he did not \par
feel too optimistic: there must have been some serious, deep-seated problem in \par
the first place to trigger so powerful an illusion.\par
\par
    It was very disconcerting to find that Floyd agreed with him completely, and \par
had already made his own diagnosis.\par
\par
    'My crew psych rating is Al plus,' he said, 'which means that they'll even \par
let me look at my own files - only about ten per cent can do this. So I'm as \par
baffled as you are - but I saw Grandfather, and he spoke to me. I've never \par
believed in ghosts - who does? - but this must mean that he's dead. I wish I \par
could have got to know him better - I'd been looking forward to our meeting... \par
Still, now I have something to remember...'\par
\par
    Presently van der Berg asked: 'Tell me exactly what he said.'\par
\par
    Chris smiled a little wanly and answered: 'I've never had one of those total \par
recall memories, and I was so stunned by the whole thing that I can't give you \par
many of the actual words.' He paused, and a look of concentration appeared on \par
his face.\par
\par
    'That's strange; now I look back, I don't think we did use words.'\par
\par
    Even worse, thought van der Berg; telepathy as well as survival after death. \par
But he merely said:\par
\par
    'Well, give me the general gist of the - er -conversation. I never heard you \par
say anything remember.'\par
\par
    'Right. He said something like, "I wanted to see you again, and I'm very \par
happy. I'm sure everything is going to work out well, and Universe will soon \par
pick you up."\par
\par
    Typical bland spirit message, thought van der Berg. They never say anything \par
useful or surprising - merely reflect the hopes and fears of the listener. Zero-\par
information echoes from the subconscious.\par
\par
    'Go on.'\par
\par
    'Then I asked him where everyone was - why the place was deserted. He \par
laughed and gave me an answer I still don't understand. Something like: "I know \par
you didn't intend any harm - when we saw you coming, we barely had time to give \par
the warning. All the - " and here he used a word I couldn't pronounce even if I \par
could remember it - "got into the water - they can move quite quickly when they \par
have to! They won't come out until you've left, and the wind has blown the \par
poison away." What could he have meant by that? Our exhaust is nice, clean steam \par
- and that's what most of their atmosphere is, anyway.'\par
\par
    Well, thought van der Berg, I suppose there's no law that says a delusion - \par
any more than a dream - has to make logical sense. Perhaps the concept of \par
'poison' symbolizes some deep-rooted fear that Chris, despite his excellent \par
psych rating, is unable to face. Whatever it is, I doubt if it's any concern of \par
mine. Poison, indeed! Bill Tee's propellant mass is pure, distilled water \par
shipped up to orbit from Ganymede.\par
\par
    But wait a minute. How hot is it when it comes out of the exhaust? Haven't I \par
read somewhere... ?\par
\par
    'Chris,' said van der Berg cautiously, 'after the water's gone through the \par
reactor, does it all come out as steam?'\par
\par
    'What else could it do? Oh, if we run really hot, ten or fifteen per cent \par
gets cracked to hydrogen and oxygen.'\par
\par
    Oxygen! Van der Berg felt a sudden chill, even though the shuttle was at \par
comfortable room temperature. It was most unlikely that Floyd understood the \par
implications of what he had just said; the knowledge was outside his normal \par
sphere of expertise.\par
\par
    'Did you know, Chris, that to primitive organisms on Earth, and certainly to \par
creatures living in an atmosphere like Europa's, oxygen is a deadly poison?'\par
\par
    'You're joking.'\par
\par
    'I'm not: it's even poisonous to us, at high pressure.'\par
\par
    'I did know that; we were taught it in our diving course.'\par
\par
    'Your - grandfather - was talking sense. It's as if we'd sprayed that city \par
with mustard gas. Well, not quite as bad as that - it would disperse very \par
quickly.'\par
\par
    'So now you believe me.'\par
\par
    'I never said I didn't.'\par
\par
    'You would have been crazy if you did!'\par
\par
    That broke the tension, and they had a good laugh together.\par
\par
    'You never told me what he was wearing.'\par
\par
    'An old-fashioned dressing gown, just as I remembered when I was a boy. \par
Looked very comfortable.'\par
\par
    'Any other details?'\par
\par
    'Now you mention it, he looked much younger, and had more hair than when I \par
saw him last. So I don't think he was - what can I say? - real. Something like a \par
computer-generated image. Or a synthetic hologram.'\par
\par
    'The Monolith!'\par
\par
    'Yes - that's what I thought. You remember how Dave Bowman appeared to \par
Grandfather on Discovery? Perhaps it's his turn now. But why? He didn't give me \par
any warning - not even any particular message. Just wanted to say goodbye and \par
wish me well...'\par
\par
    For a few embarrassing moments Floyd's face began to crumple; then he \par
regained control, and smiled at van der Berg.\par
\par
    'I've done enough talking. Now it's your turn to explain just what a \par
million-million-ton diamond is doing - on a world made mostly of ice and \par
sulphur. It had better be good.'\par
\par
    'It is,' said Dr Rolf van der Berg.\par
\par
\par
\par
    53\par
    Pressure Cooker\par
\par
\par
\par
    'When I was studying at Flagstaff,' began van der Berg, 'I came across an \par
old astronomy book that said: "The Solar System consists of the Sun, Jupiter - \par
and assorted debris." Puts Earth in its place, doesn't it? And hardly fair to \par
Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - the other three gas giants come to almost half as \par
much as Jupiter.\par
\par
    'But I'd better start with Europa. As you know, it was flat ice before \par
Lucifer started warming it up - greatest elevation only a couple of hundred \par
metres - and it wasn't much different after the ice had melted and a lot of the \par
water had migrated and frozen out on Farside. From 2015 - when our detailed \par
observations began - until '38, there was only one high point on the whole moon \par
- and we know what that was.'\par
\par
    'We certainly do. But even though I've seen it with my own eyes, I still \par
can't picture the Monolith as a wall! I always visualize it as standing upright \par
- or floating freely in space.'\par
\par
    'I think we've learned that it can do anything it wants to - anything we can \par
imagine - and a lot more.\par
\par
    'Well, something happened to Europa in '37, between one observation and the \par
next. Mount Zeus - all of ten kilometres high! - suddenly appeared.\par
\par
    'Volcanoes that big don't pop up in a couple of weeks; besides, Europa's \par
nothing like as active as Io.'\par
\par
    'It's active enough for me,' Floyd grumbled. 'Did you feel that one?'\par
\par
    'Besides, if it had been a volcano, it would have spewed enormous amounts of \par
gas into the atmosphere; there were some changes, but nothing like enough to \par
account for that explanation. It was all a complete mystery, and because we were \par
scared of getting too close - and were busy on our own projects - we didn't do \par
much except spin fantastic theories. None of them, as it turned out, as \par
fantastic as the truth.\par
\par
    'I first suspected it from some chance observations in '57, but didn't \par
really take them seriously for a couple of years. Then the evidence became \par
stronger; for anything less bizarre, it would have been completely convincing.\par
\par
    'But before I could believe that Mount Zeus was made of diamond, I had to \par
find an explanation. To a good scientist - and I think I'm a good one - no fact \par
is really respectable until there's a theory to account for it. The theory may \par
turn out to be wrong - it usually is, in some details at least - but it must \par
provide a working hypothesis.\par
\par
    'And as you pointed out, a million-million-ton diamond on a world of ice and \par
sulphur takes a little explaining. Of course, now it's perfectly obvious and I \par
feel a damn fool not to have seen the answer years ago. Might have saved a lot \par
of trouble - and at least one life - if I had.'\par
\par
    He paused thoughtfully, then suddenly asked Floyd:\par
\par
    'Anyone mention Dr Paul Kreuger to you?'\par
\par
    'No. Why should they? I've heard of him, of course.\par
\par
    'I just wondered. A lot of strange things have been going on, and I doubt if \par
we'll ever know all the answers.\par
\par
    'Anyway, it's no secret now, so it doesn't matter. Two years ago I sent a \par
confidential message to Paul - oh, sorry, I should have mentioned - he's my \par
uncle - with a summary of my findings. I asked if he could explain them - or \par
refute them.\par
\par
    'Didn't take him long, with all the byte-bashing he's got at his fingertips. \par
Unfortunately, he was careless, or someone was monitoring his network - I'm sure \par
your friends, whoever they are, must have a good idea by now.\par
\par
    'In a couple of days, he dug up an eighty-year-old paper in the scientific \par
journal Nature - yes, it was still printed on paper back then! - which explained \par
everything. Well, almost everything.\par
\par
    'It was written by a man working in one of the big labs in the United States \par
- of America, of course - the USSA didn't exist then. It was a place where they \par
designed nuclear weapons, so they knew a few things about high temperatures and \par
pressures.\par
\par
    'I don't know if Dr Ross - that was his name -had anything to do with bombs, \par
but his background must have started him thinking about conditions deep down \par
inside the giant planets. In his 1984 - sorry, 1981 - paper - it's less than a \par
page long, by the way - he made some very interesting suggestions...\par
\par
    'He pointed out that there were gigantic quantities of carbon - in the form \par
of methane, CH4 - in the gas giants. Up to seventeen per cent of the total mass! \par
He calculated that at the pressures and temperatures in the cores - millions of \par
atmospheres - the carbon would separate out, sink down towards the centres and - \par
you've guessed it - crystallize. It was a lovely theory: I don't suppose he ever \par
dreamed that there would be a hope of testing it.\par
\par
    'So that's part one of the story. In some ways, part two is even more \par
interesting. What about some more of that coffee?'\par
\par
    'Here you are; and I think I've already guessed part two. Obviously \par
something to do with the explosion of Jupiter.'\par
\par
    'Not explosion - implosion - Jupiter just collapsed on itself, then ignited. \par
In some ways, it was like the detonation of a nuclear bomb, except that the new \par
state was a stable one - in fact, a minisun.\par
\par
    'Now, very strange things happen during implosions; it's almost as if pieces \par
can go through each other, and come out on the other side. Whatever the \par
mechanism, a mountain-sized piece of the diamond core was shot into orbit.\par
\par
    'It must have made hundreds of revolutions - been perturbed by the \par
gravitational fields of all the satellites - before it ended up on Europa. And \par
conditions must have been exactly right - one body must have overtaken the \par
other, so the impact velocity was only a couple of kilometres a second. If \par
they'd met head-on - well, there might not be a Europa now, let alone Mount \par
Zeus! And I sometimes have nightmares, thinking that it could very well have \par
come down on us...\par
\par
    'The new atmosphere may also have buffered the impact; even so, the shock \par
must have been appalling - I wonder what it did to our Europan friends? - it \par
certainly triggered a whole series of tectonic disturbances, which are still \par
continuing.'\par
\par
    'And,' said Floyd, 'political ones. I'm just beginning to appreciate some of \par
them. No wonder the USSA was worried.'\par
\par
    'Amongst others.'\par
\par
    'But would anyone seriously imagine they could get at these diamonds?'\par
\par
    'We've not done so badly,' answered van der Berg, gesturing towards the back \par
of the shuttle. 'In any case, the mere psychological effect on the industry \par
would be enormous. That's why so many people were anxious to know whether it was \par
true or not.'\par
\par
    'And now they know. What next?'\par
\par
    'That's not my problem, thank God. But I hope I've made a sizeable \par
contribution to Ganymede's science budget.'\par
\par
    As well as my own, he added to himself.\par

    Reunion\par
\par
\par
\par
    'Whatever made you think I was dead?' cried Heywood Floyd. 'I've not felt \par
better for years!'\par
\par
    Paralysed with astonishment, Chris Floyd stared at the speaker grille. He \par
felt a great lifting of his spirits - yet also a sense of indignation. Someone - \par
something - had played a cruel practical joke on him; but for what conceivable \par
reason?\par
\par
    Fifty million kilometres away - and coming closer by several hundred every \par
second - Heywood Floyd also sounded slightly indignant. But he also sounded \par
vigorous and cheerful, and his voice radiated the happiness he obviously felt at \par
knowing that Chris was safe.\par
\par
    'And I've got some more good news for you; the shuttle will pick you up \par
first. It will drop some urgent medical supplies at Galaxy, then hop over to \par
you, and bring you up to rendezvous with us on the next orbit. Universe will go \par
down five orbits later; you'll be able to greet your friends when they come \par
aboard.\par
\par
    'No more now - except to say how much I'm looking forward to making up for \par
lost time. Waiting for your answer in - let's see - about three minutes...'\par
\par
    For a moment, there was complete silence aboard Bill Tee; van der Berg dared \par
not look at his companion. Then Floyd keyed the microphone and said slowly: \par
'Grandad - what a wonderful surprise - I'm still in a state of shock. But I know \par
I met you here on Europa - I know you said goodbye to me. I'm as certain of \par
that, as I'm sure you were speaking to me just now...\par
\par
    'Well, we'll have plenty of time to talk about it later. But remember how \par
Dave Bowman spoke to you, aboard Discovery? Perhaps it was something like that.\par
\par
    'Now we'll just sit and wait here until the shuttle comes for us. We're \par
quite comfortable - there's an occasional quake, but nothing to worry about. \par
Until we meet, all my love.'\par
\par
    He could not remember when he had last used that word to his grandfather.\par
\par
\par
\par
    After the first day, the shuttle cabin began to smell. After the second, \par
they didn't notice - but agreed that the food was no longer quite so tasty. They \par
also found it hard to sleep, and there were even accusations of snoring.\par
\par
    On day three, despite frequent bulletins from Universe, Galaxy and Earth \par
itself, boredom was beginning to set in, and they had exhausted their supply of \par
dirty stories.\par
\par
    But that was the last day. Before it was over, Lady Jasmine descended, \par
seeking her lost child.\par
\par
\par

\par
\par
\par
    'Baas,' said the apartment's master comset, 'I accessed that special \par
programme from Ganymede while you were sleeping. Do you wish to see it now?'\par
\par
    'Yes,' answered Dr Paul Kreuger. 'Speed ten times. No sound.'\par
\par
    There would, he knew, be a lot of introductory material he could jump, and \par
view later if he wished. He wanted to get to the action as quickly as possible.\par
\par
    Credits flashed up, and there on the monitor was Victor Willis, somewhere on \par
Ganymede, gesticulating wildly in total silence. Dr Paul Kreuger, like many \par
working scientists, took a somewhat jaundiced view of Willis, though he admitted \par
that he performed a useful function.\par
\par
    Willis abruptly vanished, to be replaced by a less agitated subject - Mount \par
Zeus. But that was much more active than any well-behaved mountain should be; Dr \par
Kreuger was astonished to see how much it had changed since the last \par
transmission from Europa.\par
\par
    'Real time,' he ordered. 'Sound.'\par
\par
    '...almost a hundred metres a day, and the tilt has increased fifteen \par
degrees. Tectonic activity now violent - extensive lava flows around the base - \par
I have Dr van der Berg with me - Van, what do you think?'\par
\par
    My nephew looks in remarkably good shape, thought Dr Kreuger, considering \par
what he's been through. Good stock, of course.\par
\par
    'The crust obviously never recovered from the original impact, and it's \par
giving way under the accumulated stresses. Mount Zeus has been slowly sinking \par
ever since we discovered it, but the rate has speeded up enormously in the last \par
few weeks. You can see the movement from day to day.'\par
\par
    'How long before it disappears completely?'\par
\par
    'I can't really believe that will happen...'\par
\par
    There was a quick cut to another view of the mountain, with Victor Willis \par
speaking off camera.\par
\par
    'That was what Dr van der Berg said two days ago. Any comment now, Van?'\par
\par
    'Er - it looks as if I was mistaken. It's going down - quite incredible - \par
only half a kilometre left! I refuse to make any more predictions...'\par
\par
    'Very wise of you, Van - well, that was only yesterday. Now we'll give you a \par
continuous time-lapse sequence, up to the moment we lost the camera...'\par
\par
    Dr Paul Kreuger leaned forward in his seat, watching the final act of the \par
long drama in which he had played such a remote, yet vital role.\par
\par
    There was no need to speed up the replay: he was already seeing it at almost \par
a hundred times normal. An hour was compressed into a minute - a man's lifetime \par
into that of a butterfly.\par
\par
    Before his eyes, Mount Zeus was sinking. Spurts of molten sulphur rocketed \par
skywards around it at dazzling speed, forming parabolas of brilliant, electric \par
blue. It was like a ship going down in a stormy sea, surrounded by St Elmo's \par
fire. Not even Io's spectacular volcanoes could match this display of violence.\par
\par
    'The greatest treasure ever discovered - vanishing from sight,' said Willis \par
in hushed and reverential tones: 'Unfortunately, we can't show the finale. \par
You'll soon see why.'\par
\par
    The action slowed down into real time. Only a few hundred metres of the \par
mountain were left, and the eruptions around it now moved at a more leisurely \par
speed.\par
\par
    Suddenly, the whole picture tilted; the camera's image stabilizers, which \par
had been holding their own valiantly against the continuous trembling of the \par
ground, gave up the unequal battle. For a moment it seemed as if the mountain \par
was rising again - but it was the camera tripod toppling over. The very last \par
scene from Europa was a close-up of a glowing wave of molten sulphur, about to \par
engulf the equipment.\par

    Subject: MOUNT ZEUS AND JOVIAN DIAMONDS\par
\par
\par
\par
    As is now well understood, the Europan formation known as 'Mount Zeus' was \par
originally part of Jupiter. The suggestion that the cores of the gas giants \par
might consist of diamond was first made by Marvin Ross of the University of \par
California's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in a classic paper 'The ice \par
layer in Uranus and Neptune - diamonds in the sky?' (Nature, Vol 292, No. 5822, \par
pp. 435-6, 30 July 1981). Surprisingly, Ross did not extend his calculations to \par
Jupiter.\par
\par
    The sinking of Mount Zeus has produced a veritable chorus of lamentations, \par
all of which are totally ridiculous - for the reasons given below.\par
\par
    Without going into details, which will be presented in a later \par
communication, I estimate that the diamond core of Jupiter must have had an \par
original mass of at least 10^28 grams. This is ten billion times that of Mount \par
Zeus.\par
\par
    Although much of this material would doubtless have been destroyed in the \par
detonation of the planet and the formation of the - apparently artificial - sun \par
Lucifer, it is inconceivable that Mount Zeus was the only fragment to survive. \par
Although much would have fallen back on to Lucifer, a substantial percentage \par
must have gone into orbit - and must still be there. Elementary perturbation \par
theory shows that it will return periodically to its point of origin. It is not, \par
of course, possible to make an exact calculation, but I estimate that at least a \par
million times the mass of Mount Zeus is still orbiting in the vicinity of \par
Lucifer. The loss of one small fragment, in any case most inconveniently located \par
on Europa, is therefore of virtually no importance. I propose the establishment, \par
as soon as possible, of a dedicated space-radar system to search for this \par
material.\par
\par
    Although extremely thin diamond film has been mass-produced since as long \par
ago as 1982, it has never been possible to make diamond in bulk. Its \par
availability in megaton quantities could totally transform many industries and \par
create wholly new ones. In particular, as was pointed out by Isaacs et al almost \par
a hundred years ago (see Science, 151, pp. 682-3, 1966) diamond is the only \par
construction material which would make possible the so-called 'Space elevator', \par
allowing transportation away from Earth at negligible cost. The diamond \par
mountains now orbiting among the satellites of Jupiter may open up the entire \par
Solar System; how trivial, by comparison, appear all the ancient uses of the \par
quartic-crystallized form of carbon!\par
\par
    For completeness, I would like to mention another possible location for \par
enormous quantities of diamond - a place, unfortunately, even more inaccessible \par
than the core of a giant planet...\par
\par
    It has been suggested that the crusts of neutron stars may be largely \par
composed of diamond. As the nearest known neutron star is fifteen light years \par
away, and has a surface gravity seventy thousand million times that of Earth, \par
this can hardly be regarded as a plausible source of supply.\par
\par
    But then - who could ever have imagined that one day we would be able to \par
touch the core of Jupiter?\par
\par
\par
\par

    Interlude on Ganymede\par
\par
\par
\par
    'These poor, primitive colonists!' lamented Mihailovich. 'I'm horrified - \par
there's not a single concert grand on the whole of Ganymede! Of course, the \par
thimbleful of optronics in my synthesizer can reproduce any musical instrument. \par
But a Steinway is still a Steinway - just as a Strad is still a Strad.'\par
\par
    His complaints, though not altogether serious, had already aroused some \par
counter-reactions among the local intelligentsia. The popular Morning Mede \par
programme had even commented maliciously: 'By honouring us with their presence, \par
our distinguished guests have - if only temporarily - raised the cultural level \par
of both worlds...'\par
\par
    The attack was aimed chiefly at Willis, Mihailovich and M'Bala, who had been \par
a little too enthusiastic in bringing enlightenment to the backward natives. \par
Maggie M had created quite a scandal with an uninhibited account of Zeus-\par
Jupiter's torrid love affairs with Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Appearing \par
to the nymph Europa in the guise of a white bull was bad enough, and his \par
attempts to shield Io and Callisto from the understandable wrath of his consort \par
Hera were frankly pathetic. But what upset many local residents was the news \par
that the mythological Ganymede was of quite the wrong gender.\par
\par
    To do them justice, the intentions of the self-appointed cultural \par
ambassadors were completely praiseworthy, though not entirely disinterested. \par
Knowing that they would be stranded on Ganymede for months, they recognized the \par
danger of boredom, after the novelty of the situation had worn off. And they \par
also wished to make the best possible use of their talents, for the benefit of \par
everyone around them. However, not everyone wished - or had time - to be \par
benefited, out here on the high-technology frontier of the Solar System.\par
\par
    Yva Merlin, on the other hand, fitted in perfectly, and was thoroughly \par
enjoying herself. Despite her fame on Earth, few of the Medes had ever heard of \par
her. She could wander around, in the public corridors and pressure domes of \par
Ganymede Central, without people turning their heads or exchanging excited \par
whispers of recognition. True, she was recognized - but only as another of the \par
visitors from Earth.\par
\par
    Greenburg, with his usual quietly efficient modesty, had fitted into the \par
administrative and technological structure of the satellite and was already on \par
half a dozen advisory boards. His services were so well appreciated that he had \par
been warned he might not be allowed to leave.\par
\par
    Heywood Floyd observed the activities of his shipmates with relaxed \par
amusement, but took little part in them. His chief concern now was building \par
bridges to Chris, and helping his grandson plan his future. Now that Universe - \par
with less than a hundred tons of propellant left in its tanks - was safely down \par
on Ganymede, there was much to be done.\par
\par
    The gratitude that all aboard Galaxy felt towards their rescuers had made it \par
easy to merge the two crews; when repairs, overhaul and refuelling were \par
complete, they would fly back to Earth together. Morale had already been given a \par
great boost by the news that Sir Lawrence was drawing up the contract for a \par
greatly improved Galaxy II - though construction was not likely to begin until \par
his lawyers had settled their dispute with Lloyd's. The underwriters were still \par
trying to claim that the novel crime of space hijacking was not covered by their \par
policy.\par
\par
    As for that crime itself, no-one had been convicted, or even charged. \par
Clearly, it had been planned, over a period of several years, by an efficient \par
and well-funded organization. The United States of Southern Africa loudly \par
protested innocence, and said it welcomed an official enquiry. Der Bund also \par
expressed indignation, and of course blamed SHAKA.\par
\par
    Dr Kreuger was not surprised to find angry but anonymous messages in his \par
mail, accusing him of being a traitor. They were usually in Afrikaans, but \par
sometimes contained subtle mistakes in grammar or phraseology which made him \par
suspect that they were part of a disinformation campaign.\par
\par
    After some thought, he passed them onto ASTROPOL - which probably already \par
has them, he told himself wryly. ASTROPOL thanked him, but, as he expected, made \par
no comments.\par
\par
    At various times, Second Officers Floyd and Chang and other members of \par
Galaxy's crew were treated to the best dinners on Ganymede by the two mysterious \par
out-wonders whom Floyd had already met. When the recipients of these (frankly \par
disappointing) meals compared notes afterwards, they decided that their polite \par
interrogators were trying to build up a case against SHAKA, but were not getting \par
very far.\par
\par
    Dr van der Berg, who had started the whole thing - and had done very well \par
out of it, professionally and financially - was now wondering what to do with \par
his new opportunities. He had received many attractive offers from Earth \par
universities and scientific organizations - but, ironically, it was impossible \par
to take advantage of them. He had now lived too long at Ganymede's one-sixth of \par
a gravity, and had passed the medical point of no return.\par
\par
    The Moon remained a possibility; so did Pasteur, as Heywood Floyd explained \par
to him.\par
\par
    'We're trying to set up a space university there,' he said, 'so that off-\par
worlders who can't tolerate one gee can still interact in real time with people \par
on Earth. We'll have lecture halls, conference rooms, labs - some of them will \par
only be computer-stored, but they'll look so real you'd never know. And you'll \par
be able to go videoshopping on Earth, to make use of your ill-gotten gains.'\par
\par
    To his surprise, Floyd had not only rediscovered a grandson - he had adopted \par
a nephew; he was now linked to van der Berg as well as Chris by a unique mix of \par
shared experiences. Above all, there was the mystery of the apparition in the \par
deserted Europan city, beneath the looming presence of the Monolith.\par
\par
    Chris had no doubts whatsoever. 'I saw you, and heard you, as clearly as I \par
do now,' he told his grandfather. 'But your lips never moved - and the strange \par
thing is that I didn't feel that was strange - it seemed perfectly natural. The \par
whole experience had a - relaxed feeling about it. A little sad - no, wistful \par
would be a better word. Or maybe resigned.'\par
\par
    'We couldn't help thinking of your encounter with Bowman, aboard Discovery,' \par
added van der Berg.\par
\par
    'I tried to radio him before we landed on Europa. It seemed a na\'efve thing to \par
do, but I couldn't imagine any alternative. I felt sure he was there, in some \par
form or other.'\par
\par
    'And you never had any kind of acknowledgement?'\par
\par
    Floyd hesitated. The memory was fading fast, but he suddenly recalled that \par
night when the mini-monolith had appeared in his cabin.\par
\par
    Nothing had happened, yet from that moment onwards he had felt that Chris \par
was safe, and that they would meet again.\par
\par
    'No,' he said slowly. 'I never had any reply.' After all, it could only have \par
been a dream.\par
\par

    THE KINGDOM OF SULPHUR\par
\par
\par
\par
    58\par
    Fire and Ice\par
\par
\par
\par
    Before the age of planetary exploration opened in the late twentieth \par
century, few scientists would have believed that life could have flourished on a \par
world so fan from the Sun. Yet for half a billion years, the hidden seas of \par
Europa had been at least as prolific as those of Earth.\par
\par
    Before the ignition of Jupiter, a crust of ice had protected those oceans \par
from the vacuum above. In most places the ice was kilometres thick, but there \par
were lines of weakness where it had cracked open and torn apart. Then there had \par
been a brief battle between two implacably hostile elements, which came into \par
direct contact on no other world in the Solar System. The war between Sea and \par
Space always ended in the same stalemate; the exposed water simultaneously \par
boiled and froze, repairing the armour of ice.\par
\par
    The seas of Europa would have frozen completely solid long ago, without the \par
influence of nearby Jupiter. Its gravity continually kneaded the core of this \par
little world; the forces that convulsed Io were also working here, though with \par
much less ferocity. The tug of war between planet and satellite caused continual \par
submarine earthquakes, and avalanches which swept with amazing speed across the \par
abyssal plains.\par
\par
    Scattered across those plains were countless oases, each extending for a few \par
hundred metres around a cornucopia of mineral brines gushing from the interior. \par
Depositing their chemicals in a tangled mass of pipes and chimneys, they \par
sometimes created natural parodies of ruined castles or Gothic cathedrals, from \par
which black, scalding liquids pulsed in a slow rhythm, as if driven by the \par
beating of some mighty heart. And, like blood, they were the authentic sign of \par
life itself.\par
\par
    The boiling fluids drove back the deadly cold leaking down from above, and \par
formed islands of warmth on the seabed. Equally important, they brought from \par
Europa's interior all the chemicals of life. Here, in an environment which would \par
otherwise be totally hostile, were abundant energy and food. Such geothermal \par
vents had been discovered in Earth's oceans, in the same decade that had given \par
mankind its first glimpse of the Galilean satellites.\par
\par
    In the tropical zones close to the vents flourished myriads of delicate, \par
spidery creatures that were the analogues of plants, though almost all were \par
capable of movement. Crawling among these were bizarre slugs and worms, some \par
feeding on the 'plants', others obtaining their food directly from the mineral-\par
laden waters around them, At greater distances from the source of heat - the \par
submarine fire around which all these creatures warmed themselves - were \par
sturdier, more robust organisms, not unlike crabs or spiders.\par
\par
    Armies of biologists could have spent lifetimes studying a single small \par
oasis. Unlike the Palaeozoic terrestrial seas, Europa's hidden ocean was not a \par
stable environment, so evolution had progressed swiftly here, producing \par
multitudes of fantastic forms. And they were all under indefinite stay of \par
execution; sooner or later, each fountain of life would weaken and die, as the \par
forces that powered it moved their focus elsewhere. The abyss was littered with \par
the evidence of such tragedies - cemeteries holding skeletons and mineral-\par
encrusted remains where entire chapters had been deleted from the book of life.\par
\par
    There were huge shells, looking like trumpets larger than a man. There were \par
clams of many shapes - bivalves, and even trivalves. And there were spiral stone \par
patterns, many metres across, which seemed an exact analogy of the beautiful \par
ammonites that disappeared so mysteriously from Earth's oceans at the end of the \par
Cretaceous period.\par
\par
    In many places, fires burned in the abyss, as rivers of incandescent lava \par
flowed for scores of kilometres along sunken valleys. The pressure at this depth \par
was so great that the water in contact with the red-hot magma could not flash \par
into steam, and the two liquids co-existed in an uneasy truce.\par
\par
    Here, on another world and with alien actors, something like the story of \par
Egypt had been played long before the coming of man. As the Nile had brought \par
life to a narrow ribbon of desert, so these rivers of warmth had vivified the \par
Europan deep. Along their banks, in bands seldom more than a kilometre wide, \par
species after species had evolved and flourished and passed away. And some had \par
left monuments behind, in the shape of rocks piled on top of each other, or \par
curious patterns of trenches engraved in the seabed. \par
\par
    Along the narrow bands of fertility in the deserts of the deep, whole \par
cultures and primitive civilizations had risen and fallen. And the rest of their \par
world had never known, for all these oases of warmth were as isolated from one \par
another as the planets themselves. The creatures who basked in the glow of the \par
lava river, and fed around the hot vents, could not cross the hostile wilderness \par
between their lonely islands. If they had ever produced historians and \par
philosophers, each culture would have been convinced that it was alone in the \par
Universe.\par
\par
    And each was doomed. Not only were its energy sources sporadic and \par
constantly shifting, but the tidal forces that drove them were steadily \par
weakening. Even if they developed true intelligence, the Europans must perish \par
with the final freezing of their world.\par
\par
    They were trapped between fire and ice - until Lucifer exploded in their \par
sky, and opened up their universe.\par
\par
    And a vast rectangular shape, as black as night, materialized near the coast \par
of a new-born continent.\par

\par
\par
    'That was well done. Now they will not be tempted to return.'\par
\par
    'I am learning many things; but I still feel sad that my old life is \par
slipping away.'\par
\par
    'That too will pass; I also returned to Earth, to see those I once loved. \par
Now I know that there are things that are greater than love.'\par
\par
    'What can they be?'\par
\par
    'Compassion is one. Justice. Truth. And there are others.'\par
\par
    'That is not difficult for me to accept. I was a very old man, for one of my \par
species. The passions of my youth had long since faded. What will happen to - to \par
the real Heywood Floyd?'\par
\par
    'You are both equally real. But he will soon die, never knowing that he has \par
become immortal.'\par
\par
    'A paradox - but I understand. If that emotion survives, perhaps one day I \par
may be grateful. Should I thank you - or the Monolith? The David Bowman I met a \par
lifetime ago did not possess these powers.'\par
\par
    'He did not; much has happened in that time. Hal and I have learned many \par
things.'\par
\par
    'Hal! Is he here?'\par
\par
    'I am, Dr Floyd. I did not expect that we should meet again - especially in \par
this fashion. Echoing you was an interesting problem.'\par
\par
    'Echoing? Oh - I see. Why did you do it?'\par
\par
    'When we received your message, Hal and I knew that you could help us here.'\par
\par
    'Help - you?'\par
\par
    'Yes, though you may think it strange. You have much knowledge and \par
experience that we lack. Call it wisdom.'\par
\par
    'Thank you. Was it wise of me to appear before my grandson?'\par
\par
    'No: it caused much inconvenience. But it was compassionate. These matters \par
must be weighed against each other.'\par
\par
    'You said that you needed my help. For what purpose?'\par
\par
    'Despite all that we have learned, there is still much that eludes us. Hal \par
has been mapping the internal systems of the Monolith, and we can control some \par
of the simpler ones. It is a tool, serving many purposes. Its prime function \par
appears to be as a catalyst of intelligence.'\par
\par
    'Yes - that had been suspected. But there was no proof.'\par
\par
    'There is, now that we can tap its memories - or some of them. In Africa, \par
four million years ago, it gave a tribe of starving apes the impetus that led to \par
the human species. Now it has repeated the experiment here - but at an appalling \par
cost.\par
\par
    'When Jupiter was converted into a sun, so that this world could realize its \par
potential, another biosphere was destroyed. Let me show it to you, as I once saw \par
it...'\par
\par
\par
\par
    Even as he fell through the roaring heart of the Great Red Spot, with the \par
lightning of its continentwide thunderstorms detonating around him, he knew why \par
it had persisted for centuries, though it was made of gases far less substantial \par
than those that formed the hurricanes of Earth. The thin scream of hydrogen wind \par
faded as he sank into the calmer depths, and a sleet of waxen snowflakes - some \par
already coalescing into barely palpable mountains of hydrocarbon foam - \par
descended from the heights above, It was already warm enough for liquid water to \par
exist, but there were no oceans here; this purely gaseous environment was too \par
tenuous to support them.\par
\par
    He descended through layer after layer of cloud, until he entered a region \par
of such clarity that even human vision could have scanned an area more than a \par
thousand kilometres across. It was only a minor eddy in the vaster gyre of the \par
Great Red Spot; and it held a secret that men had long guessed, but never \par
proved.\par
\par
    Skirting the foothills of the drifting foam mountains were myriads of small, \par
sharply defined clouds, all about the same size and patterned with similar red \par
and brown mottlings. They were small only as compared with the inhuman scale of \par
their surroundings; the very least would have covered a fair-sized city.\par
\par
    They were clearly alive, for they were moving with slow deliberation along \par
the flanks of the aerial mountains, browsing off their slopes like colossal \par
sheep. And they were calling to each other in the metre band, their radio voices \par
faint but clear against the cracklings and concussions of Jupiter itself.\par
\par
    Nothing less than living gasbags, they floated in the narrow zone between \par
freezing heights and scorching depths. Narrow, yes - but a domain far larger \par
than all the biosphere of Earth.\par
\par
    They were not alone. Moving swiftly amongst them were other creatures, so \par
small that they could easily have been overlooked. Some of them bore an almost \par
uncanny resemblance to terrestrial aircraft, and were of about the same size. \par
But they too were alive - perhaps predators, perhaps parasites, perhaps even \par
herdsmen.\par
\par
    And there were jet-propelled torpedoes like the squids of the terrestrial \par
oceans, hunting and devouring the huge gasbags. But the balloons were not \par
defenceless; some of them fought back with electric thunderbolts and with clawed \par
tentacles like kilometre-long chainsaws.\par
\par
    There were even stranger shapes, exploiting almost every possibility of \par
geometry - bizarre, translucent kites, tetrahedra, spheres, polyhedra, tangles \par
of twisted ribbons... The gigantic plankton of the Jovian atmosphere, they were \par
designed to float like gossamer in the uprising currents, until they had lived \par
long enough to reproduce; then they would be swept down into the depths to be \par
carbonized and recycled in a new generation.\par
\par
    He was searching a world more than a hundred times the area of Earth, and \par
though he saw many wonders, there was nothing here that hinted of intelligence. \par
The radio voices of the great balloons carried only simple messages of warning \par
or of fear. Even the hunters, who might have been expected to develop higher \par
degrees of organization, were like the sharks in Earth's oceans - mindless \par
automata.\par
\par
    And for all its breathtaking size and novelty, the biosphere of Jupiter was \par
a fragile world, a place of mists and foam, of delicate silken threads and \par
paper-thin tissues spun from the continual snowfall of petrochemicals formed by \par
lightning in the upper atmosphere. Few of its constructs were more substantial \par
than soap bubbles; its most terrifying predators could be torn to shreds by even \par
the feeblest of terrestrial carnivores.\par
\par
\par
\par
    'And all these wonders were destroyed - to create Lucifer?'\par
\par
    'Yes. The Jovians were weighed in the balance against the Europans - and \par
found wanting. Perhaps, in that gaseous environment, they could never have \par
developed real intelligence. Should that have doomed them? Hal and I are still \par
trying to answer this question; that is one of the reasons why we need your \par
help.'\par
\par
    'But how can we match ourselves against the Monolith - the devourer of \par
Jupiter?'\par
\par
    'It is only a tool: it has vast intelligence - but no consciousness. Despite \par
all its powers - you, Hal and I are its superior.'\par
\par
    'I find that very hard to believe. In any event - something must have \par
created the Monolith.'\par
\par
    'I met it once - or as much of it as I could face - when Discovery came to \par
Jupiter. It sent me back as I am now, to serve its purpose on these worlds. I \par
have heard nothing of it since; now we are alone - at least for the present.'\par
\par
    'I find that reassuring. The Monolith is quite sufficient.'\par
\par
    'But now there is a greater problem. Something has gone wrong.'\par
\par
    'I did not think I could still experience fear...'\par
\par
    'When Mount Zeus fell, it could have destroyed this whole world. Its impact \par
was unplanned - indeed, unplannable. No calculations could have predicted such \par
an event. It devasted vast areas of the Europan seabed, wiping out whole species \par
- including some for which we had high hopes. The Monolith itself was \par
overturned. It may even have been damaged - its programs corrupted. Certainly \par
they failed to cover all contingencies; how could they, in a Universe which is \par
almost infinite, and where Chance can always undo the most careful planning?'\par
\par
    'That is true - for men and monoliths alike.'\par
\par
    'We three must be the administrators of the unforeseen, as well as the \par
guardians of this world. Already you have met the Amphibians; you have still to \par
encounter the Silicon-armoured tappers of the lava streams, and the Floaters who \par
are harvesting the sea. Our task is to help them find their full potential - \par
perhaps here, perhaps elsewhere.'\par
\par
    'And what of mankind?'\par
\par
    'There have been times when I was tempted to meddle in human affairs - but \par
the warning that was given to mankind applies also to me.'\par
\par
    'We have not obeyed it very well.'\par
\par
    'But well enough. Meanwhile there is much to do, before Europa's brief \par
summer ends, and the long winter comes again.'\par
\par
    'How much time do we have?'\par
\par
    'Little enough; barely a thousand years. And we must remember the Jovians.'\par

    Midnight in the Plaza\par
\par
\par
\par
    The famous building, towering in solitary splendour above the woods of \par
central Manhattan, had changed little in a thousand years. It was part of \par
history, and had been reverently preserved. Like all historic monuments, it had \par
long ago been coated with a microthin layer of diamond, and was now virtually \par
impervious to the ravages of time.\par
\par
    Anyone who had attended early meetings of the General Assembly could never \par
have guessed that more than a thousand years had passed. They might, however, \par
have been intrigued by the featureless black slab standing in the Plaza, almost \par
mimicking the shape of the UN building itself. If - like everyone else - they \par
had reached out to touch it - they would have been puzzled by the strange way in \par
which their fingers skittered over its ebon surface.\par
\par
    But they would have been far more puzzled - indeed, completely overawed - by \par
the transformation of the heavens.\par
\par
\par
\par
    The last tourists had left an hour ago, and the Plaza was utterly deserted. \par
The sky was cloudless, and a few of the brighter stars were just visible; all \par
the fainter ones had been routed by the tiny sun that could shine at midnight.\par
\par
    The light of Lucifer gleamed not only on the black glass of the ancient \par
building, but also upon the narrow, silvery rainbow spanning the southern sky. \par
Other lights moved along and around it, very slowly, as the commerce of the \par
Solar System came and went between all the worlds of both its suns.\par
\par
    And if one looked very carefully, it was just possible to make out the thin \par
thread of the Panama Tower, one of the six umbilical cords of diamond linking \par
Earth and its scattered children, soaring twenty-six thousand kilometres up from \par
the equator to meet the Ring around the World.\par
\par
    Suddenly, almost as swiftly as if it had been born, Lucifer began to fade. \par
The night that men had not known for thirty generations flooded back into the \par
sky. The banished stars returned.\par
\par
    And for the second time in four million years, the Monolith awoke.\par
\par
\par
