\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 NOT ONCE IN A GENERATION DID THE VOICE OF THE CITY
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 change as it was changing now. Day and night, age after
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 age, it had never faltered. To myriads of men it had been
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the first and the last sound they had ever heard It was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 part of the city: when it ceased the city would be dead
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and the desert sands would be settling in the great streets
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of Diaspar.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Even here, half a mile above the ground, the sudden
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hush brought Convar out to the balcony. Far below, the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 moving ways were stil\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 l sweeping between the great buildings,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 but now they were thronged with silent crowds Something
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had drawn the languid people of the city from their homes: in their thousands they were drifting slowly between
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the cliffs of colored metal. And then Convar saw\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  that all
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 those myriads of faces were turned towards the sky
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 For a moment fear crept into his soul--fear lest after all
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 these ages the Invaders had come again to Earth. Then
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he too was staring at the sky, entranced by a wonder he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had never hoped to see aga\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in. He watched for many minutes
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 before he went to fetch his infant son.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The child Alvin was frightened at first. The soaring spires
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the city, the moving specks two thousand feet below--
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 these were part of his world, but the thing in the sky was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 beyond a\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ll his experience. It was larger than any of the city's
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 buildings, and its whiteness was so dazzling that it hurt the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 eye. Though it seemed to be solid, the restless winds were
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 changing its outlines even as he watched.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Once, Alvin knew, the skies of Earth \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had been filled with
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 strange shapes. Out of space the great ships had come,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 bearing unknown treasures, to berth at the Port of Diaspar
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 But that was half a billion years ago; before the beginning
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of history the Port had been buried by the drifting sand

\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 6 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Convar's voice was sad when presently he spoke to his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 son.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Look at it well, Alvin," he said. "It may be the last the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 world will ever know. I have only seen one other in all my
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 life, and once they filled the skies of Earth."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 y watched in silence, and with them all the thousands
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in the streets and towers of Diaspar, until the last cloud
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 slowly faded from sight, sucked dry by the hot, parched air
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the unending deserts.

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and vanished, but still Alvin sat staring into nothingness
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 while his mind slipped back through the ages to meet reality
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ag\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ain.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Jeserac was the Erst to speak: his voice was worried and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a little uncertain.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Those are the oldest records in the world, Alvin--the

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 came. Very few people indeed have ever seen them."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Slowly the b\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 oy turned towards his tutor. There was something
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in his eyes that worried the old man, and once again
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Jeserac regretted his action. He began to talk quickly, as if
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 trying to set his own conscience at ease.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "You know that we never talk about the ancient times,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and I only showed you those records because you were so
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 anxious to see them. Don't let them upset you: as long as
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 we're happy, does it matter how much of the world we
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 occupy? The people you have been wa\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 tching had more space,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 but they were less contented than we."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Was that true? -Alvin wondered. He thought once more
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the desert lapping round the island that was Diaspar, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his mind returned to the world that Earth had been. He saw
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 again the endless lea\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 gues of blue water, greater than the land
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 itself, rolling their waves against golden shores. His ears were
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 still ringing with the boom of breakers stilled these thousand
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 million years. And he remembered the forests and prairies,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and the strange beasts that\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  had once shared the world with
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Man.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 All this was gone. Of the oceans, nothing remained but
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 9
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 )0 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the grey deserts of salt, the winding sheets of Earth. Salt
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and sand, from Pole to Pole, with only the lights of Diaspar
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 burning in \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the wilderness that must one day overwhelm them.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 And these were the least of the things that Man had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 lost, for above the desolation the forgotten stars were shining
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 still.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Jeserac," said Alvin at last, "once I went to the Tower
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of Loranne. No one lives th\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ere any more, and I could look
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 out over the desert. It was dark, and I couldn't see the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ground, but the sky was full of colored lights. I watched them for a long time, but they never moved. So presently
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 I came away. Those were the stars, weren't they?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Jeserac was alarmed. Exactly how Alvin had got to the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Tower of Loranne was a matter for further investigation.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The boy's interests were becoming--dangerous.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Those were the stars," he answered briefly. "What of them?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We used to visit them once, didn't we\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 A long pause. Then, "Yes."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Why did we stop? What were the Invaders?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Jeserac rose to his feet. His answer echoed back through
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 all the teachers the world had ever known.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "That's enough for one day, Alvin. Later, when you are
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 elder, I'll tell you more--b\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ut not now. You already know
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 too much."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin never asked the question again: later, he had no
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 need for the answer was clear. And there was so much in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Diaspar to beguile the mind that for months he could forget that strange yearning he alone seemed to feel.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Diaspar was a world in itself. Here Man had gathered
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 all his treasures, everything that had been saved from the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ruin of the past. All the cities that had ever been had given
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 something to Diaspar: even before the coming of the Invaders
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 its name had been k\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 nown on the worlds that Man had lost.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Into the building of Diaspar had gone all the skill, all
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the artistry of the Golden Ages. When the great days were
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 coming to an end, men of genius had remoulded the city
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and given it the machines that made it immortal.\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  Whatever
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 might be forgotten, Diaspar would live and bear the descendants
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of Man safely down the stream of Time.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 They were, perhaps, as contented as any race the world
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had known, and after their fashion they were happy. They
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 spent their long lives amid beauty that had never been
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 surpassed, for the labour of millions of centuries had been
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 dedicated to the glory of Diaspar.
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 11
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 This was Alvin's world, a world which for ages had been
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sinking into a graci\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ous decadence. Of this Alvin was still
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 unconscious, for the present was so full of wonder that it
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was easy to forget the past. There was so much to do, so
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 much to learn before the long centuries of his youth ebbed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 away.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Music had been the first of the arts\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  to attract him, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for a while he had experimented with many instruments.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 But this most ancient of all arts was now so complex that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it might take a thousand years for him to master all its secrets,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and in the end he abandoned his ambitions. He could list\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 en,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 but he could never create.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 For a long time the thought-converter gave him great delight.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 On its screen he shaped endless patterns of form and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 color, usually copies--deliberate or otherwise--of the ancient
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 masters. More and more frequently he found hims\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 elf creating
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 dream landscapes from the vanished Dawn World, and often
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his thoughts turned wistfully to the records that Jeserac had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 shown him. So the smoldering flame of his discontent burned
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 slowly towards the level of consciousness, though as yet he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 scarcely worried by the vague restlessness he often felt
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 But through the months and the years, that restlessness
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was growing. Once Alvin had been content to share the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 pleasures and interests of Diaspar, but now he knew that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 they were not sufficient. His horizons were expanding, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the knowledge that all his life must be bounded by the walls
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the city was becoming intolerable to him. Yet he knew
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 well enough that there was no alternative, for the wastes
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the desert covered\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  all the world.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He had seen the desert only a few times in his life, but
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he knew no one else who had ever seen it at all. His people's
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 fear of the outer world was something he could not understand:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to him it held no terror, but only mystery. When he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was we\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ary of Diaspar, it called to him as it was calling now.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The moving ways were glittering with life and color as
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the people of the city went about their affairs. They smiled
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 at Alvin as he worked his way to the central highspeed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 section. Sometimes they greet\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ed him by name: once it had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 been flattering to think that he was known to the whole of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Diaspar, but now it gave him little pleasure.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 In minutes the express channel had swept him away from
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the crowded heart of the city, and there were few people
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in sight wh\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 en it came to a smooth halt against a long platform
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of brightly colored marble. The moving ways were so much
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a part of his life that Alvin had never imagined any other
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 12 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 form of transport. An engineer of the ancient world would
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 have gone slowly mad trying to understand how a solid roadway
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 could be Exed at both ends while its centre travelled at
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a hundred miles an hour One day Alvin might be puzzled
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 too, but for the present he accepted his environment as
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 uncritically as all the other citizens of Diaspar,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 This area of the city was almost deserted. Although the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 population of Diaspar had not altered for millenia, it was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the custom for families to move at frequent intervals. One
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 day the tide of life would swee\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 p this way again, but the great
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 towers had been lonely now for a hundred thousand years.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The marble platform ended against a wall pierced with
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 brilliantly lighted tunnels. Alvin selected one without hesitation
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and stepped into it. The peristaltic field sei\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 zed him at
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 once and propelled him forward while he lay back luxuriously,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 watching his surroundings.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It no longer seemed possible that he was in a tunnel far
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 underground. The art that had used all Diaspar for its
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 canvas had been busy here, and above Alvin t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he skies seemed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 open to the winds of heaven. All around were the spires
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the city, gleaming in the sunlight. It was not the city
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 as he knew it, but the Diaspar of a much earlier age. Although
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 most of the great buildings were familiar, there were subtle
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 d\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ifferences that added to the interest of the scene. Alvin
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 wished he could linger, but he had never found any way of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 retarding his progress through the tunnel.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 All too soon he was gently set down in a large elliptical
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 chamber, completely surrounded by windo\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ws. Through these
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he could catch tantalizing glimpses of gardens ablaze with
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 brilliant flowers. There were gardens still in Diaspar, but
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 these had existed only in the mind of the artist who conceived
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 them. Certainly there were no such flowers as these
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in the world today.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin stepped through one of the windows--and the illusion
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was shattered. He was in a circular passageway curving steeply
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 upwards. Beneath his feet the floor began to creep slowly
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 forward, as if eager to lead him to his goal. He walked \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a few
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 paces until his speed was so great that further effort would
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 be wasted.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The corridor still inclined upwards, and in a few hundred
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 feet had curved through a complete right-angle. But only
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 logic knew this: to the senses it was now as if one were
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 being \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hurried along an absolutely level corridor. The fact that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he was in reality travelling up a vertical shaft thousands of
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 13
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 feet deep gave Alvin no sense of insecurity, for a failure of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the polarizing Eeld was unthinkable.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Present\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ly the corridor began to slope "downwards" again
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 until once more it had turned through a right-angle. The
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 movement of the floor slowed imperceptibly until it came
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to rest at the end of a long hall lined with mirrors. Alvin
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was now, he knew, almost at the s\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ummit of the Tower of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Loranne.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He lingered for a while in the hall of mirrors, for it had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a fascination that was unique. There was nothing like it,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 as far as Alvin knew, in the rest of Diaspar. Through some
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 whim of the artist, only a few of the mirrors ref\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 lected the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 scene as it really was--and even those, Alvin was convinced,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were constantly changing their position. The rest certainly
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 reflected something, but it was faintly disconcerting to see
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 oneself walking amid everchanging and quite imaginary surroundings.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin wondered what he would do if he saw
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 anyone else approaching him in the mirror-world, but so far
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the situation had never arisen.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Five minutes later he was in a small, bare room throug\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 h
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 which a warm wind blew continually. It was part of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 tower's ventilating system, and the moving air escaped
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 through a series of wide openings that pierced the wall of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 building. Through them one could get a glimpse of the world
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 beyond Diaspar.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It wa\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 s perhaps too much to say that Diaspar had been
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 deliberately built so that its inhabitants could see nothing
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the outer world. Yet it was strange that from nowhere
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 else in the city, as far as Alvin knew, could one see the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 desert. The outermost towers of \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Diaspar formed a wall around
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the city, turning their backs upon the hostile world beyond,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and Alvin thought again of his people's strange reluctance
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to speak or even to think of anything outside their little
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 universe.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Thousands of feet below, the sunlight \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was taking leave
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the desert. The almost horizontal rays made a pattern of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 light against the eastern wall of the little room, and Alvin's
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 own shadow loomed enormous behind him. He shaded his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 eyes against the glare and peered down at the land upon
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 which n\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 o man had walked for unknown ages.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There was little to see: only the long shadows of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sand-dunes and, far to the west, the low range of broken
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hills beyond which the sun was setting. It was strange to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 think that of all the millions of living men, he alone had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seen this sight.
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 14 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There was no twilight: with the going of the sun, night
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 swept like a wind across the desert, scattering the stars before
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it. High in the south burned \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a strange formation that had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 puzzled Alvin before--a perfect circle of six colored stars,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 with a single white giant at its center. Few other stars had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 such brilliance, for the great suns that had once burned
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 so fiercely in the glory of youth were now gutte\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ring to their
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 doom.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 For a long time Alvin knelt at the opening, watching the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 stars fall towards the west. Here in the glimmering darkness,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 high above the city, his mind seemed to be working with a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 supernormal clarity. There were still tremendous gaps in hi\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 s
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 knowledge, but slowly the problem of Diaspar was beginning
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to reveal itself.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The human race had changed--and he had not. Once, the curiosity and the desire for knowledge which cut him
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 off from the rest of his people had been shared by all the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 world. Far \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 back in time, millions of years ago, something
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 must have happened that had changed mankind completely.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Those unexplained references to the Invaders--did the answer
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 lie there?
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was time he returned. As he rose to leave, Alvin was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 suddenly struck by a thou\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ght that had never occurred to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 him before. The air-vent was almost horizontal, and perhaps
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a dozen feet long. He had always imagined that it ended
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in the sheer wall of the tower, but this was a pure assumption.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There were, he realized now, several other possibilities.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Indeed, it was more than likely that there would be a ledge
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of some kind beneath the opening, if only for reasons of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 safety. It was too late to do any exploring now, but tomorrow
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he would come again\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 . . . .
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He was sorry to have to lie to Jeserac, but if the old man
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 disapproved of his eccentricities it was only kindness to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 conceal the truth. Exactly what he hoped to discover, Alvin
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 could not have said. He knew perfectly well that if by any
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 means he suc\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ceeded in leaving Diaspar, he would soon have
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to return. But the schoolboy excitement of a possible adventure
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was its own justification.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was not difficult to work his way along the tunnel,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 though he could not have done it easily a year before. The
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 thoug\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ht of a sheer five-thousand-foot drop at the end worried
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin not at all, for Man had completely lost his fear of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 heights. And, in fact, the drop was only a matter of a yard
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 on to a wide terrace running right and left athwart the face
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the tower.
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAIN\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ST THE FALL OF NIGHT 15
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin scrambled out into the open, the blood pounding
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in his veins. Before him, no longer framed in a narrow
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 rectangle of stone, lay the whole expanse of the desert. Above,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the face of the tower still soared hundreds of feet into th\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sky. The neighboring buildings stretched away to north and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 south, an avenue of titans. The Tower of Loranne, Alvin
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 noted with interest, was not the only one with air-vents
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 opening towards the desert. For a moment he stood drinking
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in the tremendous landscape: then he began to examine
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the ledge on which he was standing.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was perhaps twenty feet wide, and ended abruptly in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a sheer drop to the ground. Alvin, gazing fearlessly over the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 edge of the precipice, judged that the desert was\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  at least a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mile below. There was no hope in that direction.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Far more interesting was the fact that a flight of steps led
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 down from one end of the terrace, apparently to another
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ledge a few hundred feet below. The steps were cut in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the sheer face of the bu\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ilding, and Alvin wondered if they
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 led all the way to the surface. It was an exciting possibility:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in his enthusiasm, he overlooked the physical implications
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of a five-thousand-foot descent.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 But the stairway was little more than a hundred feet long.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It Cam\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e to a sudden end against a great block of stone that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seemed to have been welded across it. There was no way
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 past: deliberately and thoroughly, the route had been barred.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin approached the obstacle with a sinking heart. He
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had forgotten the sheer imposs\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ibility of climbing a stairway
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a mile high, if indeed he could have completed the descent,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and he felt a baffled annoyance at having come so far only
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to meet with failure.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He reached the stone, and for the first time saw the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 message engraved upon it. The l\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 etters were archaic, but
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he could decipher them easily enough. Three times he read
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the simple inscription: then he sat down on the great stone
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 slabs and gazed at the inaccessible land below.

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 when his visitor announced himself. He recognized Alvin
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 at once and even as the boy was entering had punched out
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his name on the information machine. Three seconds later,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin's personal card was lying in his hand.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 According to Jeserac, the duties of the Keeper of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Records were somewhat obscure, but Alvin had expected to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 find him in the heart of an enormous filin\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 g system. He had

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 as old as Jeserac. Instead, he found a middle-aged man in a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 single room containing perhaps a dozen large machines. Apart
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 from a few papers strewn across the desk, there were no
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 recor\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ds of any kind to be seen.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden's greeting was somewhat absent-minded, for he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was surreptitiously studying Alvin's card.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Alaine of Lyndar?" he said. "No, I've never heard of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 him. But we can soon find who he was."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin watched with interest while he pun\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ched a set
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of keys on one of the machines. Almost immediately there
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 came the glow of a synthesizer field, and a slip of paper
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 materialized.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Alaine seems to have been a predecessor of mine\hich\f39 \emdash \loch\f39 a very
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 long time ago. I thought I knew all the Keepers for the last

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It's so long ago that only his name has been recorded, with
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 no other details at all. Where was that inscription?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "In the Tower of Loranne," said Alvin after a moment's
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hesitation.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Another set of keys was punched, but this time the field
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 did not reappear and no paper materialized.

\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 20 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "What are you doing?" asked Alvin. "Where are all your
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 records?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The Keeper laughed.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "That always puzzles people. It would\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  be impossible to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 keep written records of all the information we need: it's
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 recorded electrically and automatically erased after a certain
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 time, unless there's a special reason for preserving it. If
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alaine left any message for posterity, we'll soon discove\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 r it."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "How?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "There's no one in the world who could tell you that.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 All I know is that this machine is an Associator. If you give
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it a set of facts, it will hunt through the sum total of human
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 knowledge until it correlates them."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Doesn't that take a lot o\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 f time?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Very often. I have sometimes had to wait twenty years
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for an answer. So won't you sit down?" he added, the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 crinkles round his eyes belying his solemn voice.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin had never met anyone quite like the Keeper of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the Records, and he decided that he l\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 iked him. He was tired
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of being reminded that he was a boy, and it was pleasant
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to be treated as a real person.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Once again the synthesizer field flickered and Rorden
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 bent down to read the slip. The message must have been
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a long one, for it took him several minutes to finish it.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Finally he sat down on one of the room's couches, looking
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 at his visitor with eyes which, as Alvin noticed for the first
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 time, were of a most disconcerting shrewdness.

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his curiosity any longer.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden did not reply. Instead, he was the one to ask for
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 information.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Why do you want to leave Diaspar?" he said quietly.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 If Jeserac or his father had asked him that question, Alvin
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 would have found \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 himself floundering in a morass of half-
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 truths or downright lies. But with this man, whom he had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 iret for only a few minutes, there seemed none of the barriers
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Aat had cut him off from those he had known all his life.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I'm not sure," he said, speaking slo\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 wly but readily. "I've

\par \loch\af39\dbch\af31505\hich\f39 \emdash \loch\f39 but I want to go there all the same."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He looked shyly at Rorden, as if expecting encouragement,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 but the Keeper's eyes were far away. When at last he again
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 turned to Alvi\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 n, there was an expression on his face that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the boy could not fully understand, but it held a tinge of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sadness that was somewhat disturbing.
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 21
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 No one could have told that Rorden had come to the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 greatest crisis in his life. For thousands of years he had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 carried out his duties as the interpreter of the machines,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 duties requiring little initiative or enterprise. Somewhat apart
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 from the tumult of the city, rather aloof from his fellows,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden had li\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ved a happy and contented life. And now this
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 boy had come, disturbing the ghosts of an age that had been
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 dead for millions of centuries, and threatening to shatter his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 cherished peace of mind.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 A few words of discouragement would be enough to destroy
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the th\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 reat, but looking into the anxious, unhappy eyes,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden knew that he could never take the easy way. Even
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 without the message from Alaine, his conscience would have
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 forbidden it.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Alvin," he began, "I know there are many things that have been puzzling you.\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  Most of all, I expect, you have

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin nodded, wondering how the other could have read

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It all started when Man was Eghting the Invaders--whoever
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 or whatever they were. Before that, he had been expanding
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 through the stars, but he was driven back to Earth in wars
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of which we have no con\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ception. Perhaps that defeat changed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his character, and made him content to pass the rest of his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 existence on Earth. Or perhaps the Invaders promised to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 leave him in peace if he would remain on his own planet:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 we don't know. All that is certain is that he \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 started to develop
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 an intensely centralized culture, of which Diaspar was the

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "At first there were many of the great cities, but in the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 end Diaspar absorbed them all, for there seems to be some

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Few people ever recognize its presence, but we all have a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 fear of the outer world, and a longing for what is known and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 understood. That fear may be irrational, or it may have some

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The Keeper smiled wryly.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I'm afraid I cannot say the same. But at least I can
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 appreciate your point of view, even if I cannot share it. Once I might have felt doubtful about helping you, but not now

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden laughed.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I don't intend to do so until you're a good deal older.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 But I'll tell you what it was about.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Alaine foresaw that people like you would be born in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 future ages: he realized that they m\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ight attempt to leave
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Diaspar and he set out to help them. I imagine that whatever
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 way you tried to leave the city, you would meet an
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 inscription directing you to the Keeper of the Records.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Knowing that the Keeper would then question his machines,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alaine left a message, buried safely among the thousands and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 millions of records that exist. It could only be found if the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Associator was deliberately looking for it. That message directs
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 any Keeper to assist the enquirer, even if he disapproves of his que\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 st. Alaine believed that the human race was becoming
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 decadent, and he wanted to help anyone who might regenerate
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it. Do you follow all this?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin nodded gravely and Rorden continued.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I hope he was wrong. I don't believe that humanity is
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 decadent--it's s\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 imply altered. You, of course, will agree with

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to be different from everyone else! We are happy: if we have lost anything, we're not aware of it.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Alaine wrote a good deal in his message, but the i\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mportant
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 part is this. There are three ways out of Diaspar. He does
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 not say where they lead, nor does he give any clues as to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 how they can be found, though there are some very obscure
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 references I'll have to think about. But even if what he says
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 is true, y\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ou are far too young to leave the city. Tomorrow

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 leave me now--I have a good deal to think about."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden felt a little embarrassed by the boy's gratitude.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 When Alvin had gone, he sat for a while \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 wondering if, after
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 all, he had acted rightly.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There was no doubt that the boy was an atavism--a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 throwback to the great ages. Every few generations there
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 still appeared minds that were the equal of any the ancient

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 vanced to be checked by any individual genius, however
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 brilliant. After a few centuries of restlessness, the variants
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 accepted their fate and ceased to struggle against it. When
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin understood his position, would he too realize that his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 only hope of happiness lay in conforming with the world?
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden wondered\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  if, after all, it might not have been kinder
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in the long run to discourage him. But it was too late now:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alaine had seen to that.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The ancient Keeper of the Records must have been a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 remarkable man, perhaps an atavism himself. How many
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 times down the ages h\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ad other Keepers read that message
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of his and acted upon it for better or worse? Surely, if there
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had been any earlier cases, some record would have been
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 made.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden thought intently for a moment: then, slowly at
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 first, but soon with mounting conEdence, h\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e began to put
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 question after question to the machines, until every Associator
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in the room was running at full capacity. By means now
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 beyond the understanding of man, billions upon billions of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 facts were racing through the scrutinizers. There was nothing
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 o do but to wait. . . .
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 IN AFTER YEARS, ALVIN WAS OFTEN TO MARVEL AT HIS GOOD
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 fortune. Had the Keeper of the Records been unfriendly, his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 quest could never have begun. But Rorden, in spite of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 years between them, shared something of his own curiosity.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 I\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 n Rorden's case, there was only the desire to uncover lost
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 knowledge: he would never have used it, for he shared with
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the rest of Diaspar that dread of the outer world which
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin found so strange. Close though their friendship became,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that barrier was always to lie between them.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin's life was now divided into two quite distinct portions.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He continued his studies with Jeserac, acquiring the immense
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and intricate knowledge of people, places and customs without
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 which no one could play a\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ny part in the life of the city.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Jeserac was a conscientious but a leisurely tutor, and with so
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 many centuries before him he felt no urgency in completing
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his task. He was, in fact, rather pleased that Alvin should
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 have made friends with Rorden. The Keeper\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  of the Records
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was regarded with some awe by the rest of Diaspar, for he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 alone had direct access to all the knowledge of the past.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 How enormous and yet how incomplete that knowledge
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was, Alvin was slowly learning. In spite of the self-cancelling

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 circuits which obliterated all information as soon as it was

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 at the smallest estimate. Whether there was any limit to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the capacity of the machines Rorden did not know: tha\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 t
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 knowledge was lost with the secret of their operation.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The Associators were a source of endless wonder to Alvin,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 who would spend hours setting up questions of their keyboards.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was amusing to discover that people whose names
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 began with "S" had a tenden\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 cy to live in the eastern part
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the city--though the machines hastened to add that the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 fact had no statistical signiEcance. Alvin quickly accumulated
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a vast array of similar useless facts which he employed to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 impress his friends. At the same time, under Rorden's
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 guidance, he was learning all that was known of the Dawn
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Ages, for Rorden had insisted that it would need years of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 preparation before he could begin his quest. Alvin had recognized
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the truth of this, th\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ough he sometimes rebelled against
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it. But after a single attempt, he abandoned any hope of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 acquiring knowledge prematurely.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He had been alone one day when Rorden was paying
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 one of his rare visits to the administrative centre of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 city. The temptation ha\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 d been too strong, and he had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ordered the Associators to hunt for Alaine's message.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 When Rorden returned, he found a very scared boy trying
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to discover why all the machines were paralyzed. To Alvin's
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 immense relief, Rorden had only laughed and punched a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 se\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ries of combinations that had cleared the jam. Then he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 turned to the culprit and tried to address him severely.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Let that be a lesson to you, Alvin! I expected something

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sheet of paper covered with writing. He ran through it

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 been deliberately concealed. I set the Associators to \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 investigate
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 all the major engineering operations carried out in the city
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 since the records began. This is a report on the construction
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the central park--and AJaine has added a note to it himself. As soon as it encountered his name, of course, the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 machin\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e knew it had finished the search and called for me."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden glanced at the paper as if rereading part of it
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 again. Then he continued:--
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We've always taken it for granted that all the moving
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ways should converge on the Park: it seems natural for them
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to d\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 o so. But this report states that the Park was built after
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the founding of the city--many millions of years later, in tact. Therefore the moving ways once led to something the"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "An airport, perhaps?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "No: flying was never allowed over any city, except in ^\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ery ancient times, before the moving ways were built. Even

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 " 'When the desert buried the Port of Diaspar, the emergency
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 system which had been built against that day was able
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to carry the remaini\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ng transport. It was finally closed down
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 by Yarlan Zey, builder of the Park, having remained almost
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 unused since the Migration.' "
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin looked rather puzzled.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "It doesn't tell me a great deal," he complained.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden smiled. "You've been letting the Associators do
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 too much thinking for you," he admonished gently. "Like
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 all of Alaine's statements, it's deliberately obscure lest the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 wrong people should learn from it. But I think it tells us
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 quite enough. Doesn't t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he name "Yarlan Zey" mean anything
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to you?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I think I understand," said Alvin slowly. "You're talking
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 about the Monument?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Yes: it's in the exact centre of the Park. If you extended

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the moving ways, they would all meet there\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 . Perhaps, once
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 upon a time, they did."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin was already on his feet.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Let's go and have a look," he exclaimed.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden shook his head.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "You've seen the Tomb of Yarlen Zey a score of times
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and noticed nothing unusual about it. Before we rush off,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 don't you\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  think it would be a good idea to question the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 machines again?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin was forced to agree, and while they were waiting
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 began to read the report that the Associator had already produced.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Rorden," he said at-last, "what did Alaine mean when
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he spoke about t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he Migration?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "It's a term often used in the very earliest records," answered
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden. "It refers to the time when the other cities
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were decaying and all the human race was moving towards
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Diaspar."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Then this 'emergency system,' whatever it is, leads to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 them?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Almost certainly."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin meditated for a while.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "So you think that even if we do find the system, it will
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 only lead to a lot of ruined cities?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I doubt if it will even do that," replied Rorden. "When
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 they were abandoned, the machines were closed d\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 own and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the desert will have covered them by now."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin refused to be discouraged.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "But Alaine must have known that!" he protested. Rorden
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 shrugged his shoulders.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We're only guessing," he said, "and the Associator hasn't
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 any information at the moment. It\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  may take several hours,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 but with such a restricted subject we should have all the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 recorded facts before the end of the day. We'll follow your
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 advice after all."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The screens of the city were down and the sun was shining
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 fiercely, though its rays would have\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  felt strangely weak to a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 man of the Dawn Ages. Alvin had made this journey a hundred
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 times before, yet now it seemed almost a new adventure.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 When they came to the end of the moving way, he bent
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 down and examined the surface that had carried them through
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he city. For the first time in his life, he began to realize
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 something of its wonder. Here it was motionless, yet a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hundred yards away it was rushing directly towards him faster
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 than a man could run.
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 30 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden was watching him, but he misunderstood the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 boy's curiosity.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "When the park was built," he said, "I suppose they had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to remove the last section of the way. I doubt if you'll learn
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 anything from it."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I wasn't thinking of that," said Alvin. "I was won\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 dering
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 how the moving ways work."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden looked astonished, for the thought had never occurred
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to him. Ever since men had lived in cities, they had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 accepted without thinking the multitudinous services that lay
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 beneath their feet. And when the cities had be\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 come completely
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 automatic, they had ceased even to notice that they
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were there.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Don't worry about that," he said. "I can show you a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 thousand greater puzzles. Tell me how my Recorders get
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 their information, for example."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 So, without a second thought, Rorde\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 n dismissed the moving
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ways--one of the greatest triumphs of human engineering.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The long ages of research that had gone to the making of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 anisotropic matter meant nothing to him. Had he been told
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that a substance could have the properties of a solid in one
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 dimension and of a liquid in the other two, he would not
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 even have registered surprise.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The Park was almost three miles across, and since every
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 pathway was a curve of some kind all distances were considerably
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 exaggerated. When he had been younger Alvin had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 spent a great deal of time among the trees and plants of this
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 largest of the city's open spaces. He had explored the whole
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of it at one time or another, but in later years much of its
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 charm had vanished. Now he understood why: he had seen
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the ancient reco\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 rds and knew that the Park was only a pale
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 shadow of a beauty that had vanished from the world.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 They met many people as they walked through the avenues
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of ageless trees and over the dwarf, perennial grass that never
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 needed trimming. After a while they grew\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  tired of acknowledging
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 greetings, for everyone knew Afvin and almost everyone
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 knew the Keeper of the Records. So they left the paths
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and wandered through quiet byways almost overshadowed by
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 trees. Sometimes the trunks crowded so closely round them
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that th\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e great towers of the city were hidden from sight.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and for a little while Alvin could imagine he was in the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ancient world of which he had so often dreamed.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The Tomb of Yarlan Zey was the only building in the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Park. An avenue of the eternal trees led up the \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 low hill
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 on which it stood, its rose-pink columns gleaming in the sun\page AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 31
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 light. The roof was open to the sky, and the single chamber
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was paved with great slabs of apparently natural stone. But
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for geological ages human feet had cr\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ossed and recrossed that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 floor and left no trace upon its inconceivably stubborn material.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin and Rorden walked slowly into the chamber, until
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 they came face to face with the statue of Yarlan Zey.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The creator of the great park sat with slightly downcast
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 eyes, as if examining the plans spread across his knees. His
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 face wore that curiously elusive expression that had baffled
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the world for so many generations. Some had dismissed it as
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 no more than a whim of the artist's, but to others it seemed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that Yarlan Zey was smiling at some secret jest. Now Alvin
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 knew that they had been correct.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden was standing motionless before the statue, as if
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seeing it for the first time in his life. Presently he walked
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 back a few yards and began to examine the grea\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 t flagstones.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "What are you doing?" asked Alvin.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Employing a little logic and a great deal of intuition,"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 replied Rorden. He refused to say any more, and Alvin
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 resumed his examination of the statue. He was still doing
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 this when a faint sound behind him at\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 tracted his attention.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden, his face wreathed in smiles, was slowly sinking into
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the floor. He began to laugh at the boy's expression.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I think I know how to reverse this," he said as he disappeared.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "If I don't come up immediately, you'll have to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 pull \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 me out with a gravity polarizer. But I don't think it will
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 be necessary."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The last words were muffled, and, rushing to the edge
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the rectangular pit, Alvin saw that his friend was already
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 many feet below the surface. Even as he watched, the shaft
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 deepene\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 d swiftly until Rorden had dwindled to a speck no longer recognizable as a human being. Then, to Alvin's relief,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the far-off rectangle of light began to expand and the pit
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 shortened until Rorden was standing beside him once more.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 For a moment there was a p\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 rofound silence. Then Rorden
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 smiled and began to speak.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Logic," he said, "can do wonders if it has something to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 work upon. This building is so simple that it couldn't conceal
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 anything, and the only possible secret exit must be through
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the floor. I argued that it would be marked in some way,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 so I searched until I found a slab that differed from all the rest."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin bent down and examined the floor.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "But it's just the same as all the others!" he protested.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden put his hands on the boy'\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 s shoulders and turned
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 32 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 him round until he was looking towards the statue. For a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 moment Alvin stared at it intently. Then he slowly nodded
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his head.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I see," he whispered. "So that is the secret of Yarian
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Zey!"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The eyes of the \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 statue were fixed upon the floor at his feet. There was no mistake. Alvin moved to the next slab,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and found that Yarian Zey was no longer looking towards
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 him.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Not one person in a thousand would ever notice that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 unless they were looking for it," said Rorde\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 n, "and even, then, it would mean nothing to them. At first I felt rather
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 foolish myself, standing on that slab and going through
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 different combinations of control thoughts. Luckily the circuits
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 must be fairly tolerant, and the code-thought turned out
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to b\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e "Alaine of Lyndar." I tried "Yarian Zey" at first, but
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it wouldn't work, as I might have guessed. Too many people
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 would have operated the machine by accident if that trigger
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 thought had been used."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "It sounds very simple," admitted Alvin, "but I don't th\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ink I would have found it in a thousand years. Is that how the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Associators work?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden laughed.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Perhaps," he said. "I sometimes reach the answer before
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 they do, but they always reach it." He paused for a moment.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 We'll have to leave the shaft open: no one is likely to fall down it."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 As they sank smoothly into the earth, the rectangle of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sky dwindled until it seemed very small and far away. The
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 shaft was lit by a phosphorescence that was part of the walls,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and seeme\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 d to be at least a thousand feet deep. The walls
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were perfectly smooth and gave no indication of the machinery
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that had lowered them.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The doorway at the bottom of the shaft opened automatically
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 as they stepped towards it. A few paces took them
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 through the \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 short corridor--and then they were standing,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 overawed by its immensity, in a great circular cavern whose
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 walls came together in a graceful, sweeping curve three hundred
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 feet above their heads. The column against which they
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were standing seemed too slender \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to support the hundreds
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of feet of rock above it. Then Alvin noticed that it did not
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seem an integral part of the chamber at all, but was clearly of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 much later construction. Rorden had come to the same conclusion.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "This column," he said, "was built simply\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  to house the
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 35
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 shaft down which we came. We were right about the moving
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ways--they all lead into this place."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin had noticed, without realizing what they were, the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 great tunnels that pierced the circumference of the chamber
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He could see that they sloped gently upwards, and now he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 recognized the familiar grey surface of the moving ways
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Here, far beneath the heart of the city, converged the wonderful
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 transport system that carried all the traffic of Diaspar.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 But these were only the severed stumps of the great roadways:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the strange material that gave them life was now frozen into
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 immobility.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin began to walk towards the nearest of the tunnels. He had gone only a few paces when he realized that something
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 happening to the ground beneath his feet. It was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 becoming transparent. A few more yards, and he seemed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to be standing in mid-air without any visible support. He Stopped and stared down into the void beneath.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Rorden!" he called. "Come and look at this!"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Th\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e other joined him, and together they gazed at the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 marvel beneath their feet. Faintly visible, at an indefinite
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 depth, lay an enormous map--a great network of lines converging
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 towards a spot beneath the central shaft. At first it
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seemed a confused maze, bu\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 t after a while Alvin was able
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to grasp its main outlines. As usual, he had scarcely begun
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his own analysis before Rorden finished his.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "The whole of this floor must have been transparent once,"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 said the Keeper of the Records. "When this chamber was sealed\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  and the shaft built, the engineers must have done
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 something to make the center opaque. Do you understand
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 what it is, Alvin?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I think so," replied the boy. "It's a map of the transport
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 system, and those little circles must be the other cities of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Earth. I \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 can just see names beside them, but they're too faint
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to read."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "There must have been some form of internal illumination
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 once," said Rorden absently. He was looking towards the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 walls of the chamber.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I thought so!" he exclaimed. "Do you see how all these
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 radiating lines lead towards the small tunnels?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin had noticed that besides the great arches of the moving
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ways there were innumerable smaller tunnels leading out
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the chamber--tunnels that sloped downwards instead of up.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden continued without wai\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ting for a reply.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "It was a magnificent system. People would come down
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 34 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the moving ways, select the place they wished to visit, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 then follow the appropriate line on the map."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "And what happens then?" said Alvin.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 As usual, Ro\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 rden refused to speculate.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I haven't enough information," he answered. "I wish
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 we could read the names of those citiesi" he complained,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 changing the subject abruptly.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin had wandered away and was circumnavigating the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 central pillar. Presently his voice\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  came to Rorden, slightly
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 muffled and overlaid with echoes from the walls of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 chamber.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "What is it?" called Rorden, not wishing to move as he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had nearly deciphered one of the dimly visible groups of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 characters. But Alvin's voice was insistent, so he wen\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 t to join
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 him.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Far beneath was the other half of the great map, its faint
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 web-work radiating towards the points of the compass. But
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 this time not all of it was too dim to be clearly seen, for one
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the lines, and one only, was brilliantly illuminated. It
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seemed to have no connection with the rest of the system, and pointed like a gleaming arrow to one of the downward-
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sloping tunnels. Near its end the line transfixed a circle of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 golden light, and against that circle was the single word
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 LYS." That was all.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 For a long time Alvin and Rorden stood gazing down at that silent symbol. To Rorden it was no more than another
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 question for his machines, but to Alvin its promise was boundless.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He tried to imagine this great chamber as it had been
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in the ancient days, wh\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 en air transport had come to an end
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 but the cities of Earth still had commerce one with the other.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He thought of the countless millions of years that had passed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 with the traffic steadily dwindling and the lights on the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 great map dying one by one, until at \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 last only this single
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 line remained. He wondered how long it had gleamed there
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 among its darkened companions, waiting to guide the steps
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that never came, until at last Yarlan Zey had sealed the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 moving ways and closed Diaspar against the world.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 That had bee\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 n hundreds of millions of years ago. Even
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 then, Lys must have lost touch with Diaspar. It seemed impossible
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that it could have survived: perhaps, after all, the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 map meant nothing now.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden broke into his reverie at last. He seemed a little
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 nervous and il\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 l at ease.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "It's time we went back," he said. "I don't think we
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 should go any further now."
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 3?
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin recognized the undertones in his friend's voice, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 did not argue with him. He was eager to go forward, but
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 realized that it mi\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ght not be wise without further preparation
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Reluctantly he turned again toward the central pillar As he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 walked to the opening of the shaft, the floor beneath him
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 gradually clouded into opacity, and the gleaming enigma tar
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 below slowly faded from siglit.
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 4

\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 NOW THAT THE WAY LAY OPEN AT LAST BEFORE HIM, ALVIN
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 felt a strange reluctance to leave the familiar world of Dia-
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 spar. He began to discover that he himself was not immune
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 from the fears he had so often derided in others.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Once or twice Ro\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 rden had tried to dissuade him, but the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 attempt had been half-hearted. It would have seemed strange
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to a man of the Dawn Ages that neither Alvin nor Rorden
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 saw any danger in what they were doing. For millions of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 years the world had held nothing that could \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 threaten man,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and even Alvin could not imagine types of human beings
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 greatly different from those he knew in Dispar. That he might
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 be detained against his will was a thought wholly inconceivable
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to him. At the worst, he could only fail to discover anything.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Three days later, they stood once more in the deserted
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 chamber of the moving ways. Beneath their feet the arrow
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of light still pointed to Lys--and now they were ready to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 follow it.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 As they stepped into the tunnel, they felt the familiar tug
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the peris\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 taltic field and in a moment were being swept
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 effortlessly into the depths. The journey lasted scarcely a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 minute: when it ended they were standing at one end of a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 long, narrow chamber in the form of a half-cylinder. At the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 far end, two dimly lit tunnels stretched away towards infinity.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Men of almost every civilization that had existed since the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Dawn would have found their surroundings completely familiar:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 yet to Alvin and Rorden they were a glimpse of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 another world. The purp\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ose of the long, streamlined machine
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that lay aimed like a projectile at the far tunnel was obvious,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 but that made it none the less novel. Its upper portion was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 transparent, and looking through the walls Alvin could see
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 rows of luxuriously appointed seats.\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  There was no sign of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 any entrance, and the whole machine was floating about a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 foot above a single metal rod that stretched away into the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 distance, disappearing in one of the tunnels. A few yards
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 away another rod led to the second tunnel, but no machine
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 fl\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 oated above it. Alvin knew, as surely as if he had been told,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that somewhere beneath unknown, far-off Lys, that second
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 machine was waiting in another such chamber as this.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 39
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 40 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Well," said Rorden, rather lamely, "Are you ready?\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin nodded.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I wish you'd come," he said--and at once regretted it
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 when he saw the disquiet on the other's face. Rorden was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the closest friend he had ever possessed, but he could never
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 break through the barriers that surrounded all his race.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "111 be ba\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ck within six hours," Alvin promised, speaking
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 with difficulty for there was a mysterious tightness in his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 throat. "Don't bother to wait for me. If I get back early I'll
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 call you--there must be some communicators around here."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was all very casual and matter-of-fact, Alvin told himself.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Yet he could not help jumping when the walls of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 machine faded and the beautifully designed interior lay open
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 before his eyes.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden was speaking, rather quickly and jerkily.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "You'll have n\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 o difficulty in controlling the machine," he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 said. "Did you see how it obeyed that thought of mine?
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 I should get inside quickly in case the time delay is fixed."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin stepped aboard, placing his belongings on the nearest
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seat. He turned to face Rorden, wh\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 o was standing in the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 barely visible frame of the doorway. For a moment there was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a strained silence while each waited for the other to speak.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The decision was made for them. There was a faint flicker
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of translucence, and the walls of the machine had close\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 d
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 again. Even as Rorden began to wave farewell, the long cylinder
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 started to ease itself forward. Before it had entered the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 tunnel, it was already moving faster than a man could run.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Slowly Rorden made his way back to the chamber of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 moving ways with it\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 s great central pillar. Sunlight was streaming
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 down the open shaft as he rose to the surface. When he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 emerged again into the Tomb of Yarlan Zey, he was disconcerted,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 though not surprised, to find a group of curious onlookers
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 gathered around him.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "There's n\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 o need to be alarmed," he said gravely. "Someone
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 has to do this every few thousand years, though it hardly
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seems necessary. The foundations of the city are perfectly
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 stable--they haven't shifted a micron since the Park was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 built."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He walked briskly away, and as he left the tomb a quick
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 backward glance showed him that the spectators were already

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sure that they would think no more about the incident.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin settled back amon\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 g the upholstery and let his eyes
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 wander round the interior of the machine. For the first time
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 41
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he noticed the indicator board that formed part of the forward
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 wall. It carried the simple message:--
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 lys
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 35 MINUTES
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Even as he wat\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ched, the number changed to "34." That at
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 least was useful information, though as he had no idea of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the machine's speed it told him nothing about the length
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the journey. The walls of the tunnel were one continual
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 blur of grey, and the only sensation of \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 movement was a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 very slight vibration he would never have noticed had he not
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 been expecting it.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Diaspar must be many miles away by now, and above him
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 would be the desert with its shifting sand dunes. Perhaps at
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 this very moment he was racing beneath the bro\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ken hills he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had watched as a child from the Tower of Loranne.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 His thoughts came back to Lys, as they had done continually
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for the past few days. He wondered if it still existed,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and once again assured himself that not otherwise would the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 machine be carryi\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ng him there. What sort of city would it
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 be? Somehow the strongest effort of his imagination could
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 only picture another and smaller version of Diaspar.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Suddenly there was a distinct change in the vibration of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the machine. It was slowing down--there was no question
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of that. The time must have passed more quickly than he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had thought: somewhat surprised, Alvin glanced at the indicator.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 LYS
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 23 MINUTES
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Feeling very puzzled, and a little worried, he pressed his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 face\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  against the side of the machine. His speed was still blurring the walls of the tunnel into a featureless grey, yet
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 now from time to time he could catch a glimpse of markings
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that disappeared almost as quickly as they came. And at
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 each appearance, they see\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 med to remain in his field of vision
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for a little longer.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Then, without any warning, the walls of the tunnel were
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 snatched away on either side. The machine was passing, still
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 at a very great speed, through an enormous empty space, far
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 larger even than the \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 chamber of the moving ways.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Peering in wonder through the transparent walls, Alvin
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 could glimpse beneath him an intricate network of guiding
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 42 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 rods, rods that crossed and crisscrossed to disappear into a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 maze of tunnels on eithe\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 r side. Overhead, a long row of artificial
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 suns flooded the chamber with light, and silhouetted
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 against the glare he could just make out the frameworks of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 great carrying machines. The light was so brilliant that it
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 pained the eyes, and Alvin knew that this\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  place had not been |
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 intended for man. What it was intended for became clear a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 moment later, when his vehicle flashed past row after row ,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of cylinders, lying motionless above their guide-rails. They |
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 weie larger than the machine in which he was travelling, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin realised that they must be freight transporters. Around
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 them were grouped incomprehensible machines, all silent
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and stilled. |
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Almost as quickly as it had appeared, the vast and lonely I
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ch\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 amber vanished behind him. Its passing left a feeling of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 awe in Alvin's mind: for the first time he really understood
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the meaning of that great, darkened map below Diaspar. The
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 world was more full of wonder than he had ever dreamed.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin glanced again at \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the indicator. It had not changed:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he had taken less than a minute to flash through the great
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 cavern. The machine was accelerating again, although there
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was still no sense of motion. But on either side the tunnel
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 walls were flowing past at a speed he could\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  not even guess.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It seemed an age before that indefinable change of vibration
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 occurred again. Now the indicator was reading:--
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 lys
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 I MINUTE
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and that minute was the longest Alvin had ever known. More
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and more slowly moved the machine: this was no mere slack\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ening
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of its speed. It was coming to rest at last.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Smoothly and silently the long cylinder slid out of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 tunnel into a cavern that might have been the twin of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 one beneath Diaspar. For a moment Alvin was too excited to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 see anything clearly. His though\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ts were jumbled and he could
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 not even control the door, which opened and closed several
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 times before he pulled himself together. As he jumped out
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the machine, he caught a last glimpse of the indicator. Its
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 wording had changed and there was something about its
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 message that was very reassuring:--
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 diaspar
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 35 MINUTES
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 IT HAD BEEN AS SIMPLE AS THAT. NO ONE COULD HAVE
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 guessed that he had made a journey as fateful as any in the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 history of Man.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 As he began to search\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  for a way out of the chamber, Alvin
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 found the first sign that he was in a civilization very different
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 from the one he had left. The way to the surface clearly
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 lay through a low, wide tunnel at one end of the cavern--
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and leading up through the tunnel was \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a flight of steps. Such
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a thing was almost unknown in Diaspar. The machines disliked
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 stairways, and the architects of the city had built ramps
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 or sloping corridors wherever there was a change of level.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Was it possible that there were no machines in Lys? Th\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 idea was so fantastic that Alvin dismissed it at once.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The stairway was very short, and ended against doors that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 opened at his approach. As they closed silently behind him,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin found himself in a large cubical room which appeared
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to have no other exit.\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  He stood for a moment, a little puzzled,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and then began to examine the opposite wall. As he did so,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the doors through which he had entered opened once more.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Feeling somewhat annoyed, Alvin left the room again--to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 find himself looking along a vaulted corri\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 dor rising slowly to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 an archway that framed a semicircle of sky. He realized that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he must have risen many hundreds of feet, but there had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 been no sensation of movement. Then he hurried forward
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 up the slope to the sunlit opening.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He was standing at the brow of a low hill, and for an instant
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it seemed as if he were once again in the central park
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of Diaspar. Yet if this were indeed a park, it was too enormous
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for his mind to grasp. The city he had expected to see
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was nowhere visible.\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  As far as the eye could reach there was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 nothing but forest and grass-covered plains.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 45
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 46 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Then Alvin lifted his eyes to the horizon, and there above
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the trees, sweeping from right to left in a great arc that encircled
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the world\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 , was a line of stone which would have
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 dwarfed the mightiest giants of Diaspar. It was so far away
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that its details were blurred by sheer distance, but there was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 something about its outlines that Alvin found puzzling. Then
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his eyes became at last accustome\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 d to the scale of that colossal
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 landscape, and he knew that those far-off walls had not
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 been built by Man.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Time had not conquered everything: Earth still possessed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mountains of which she could be proud.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 For a long time Alvin stood at the mouth of the tunne\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 l,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 growing slowly accustomed to the strange world in which he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had found himself. Search as he might, nowhere could he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 see any trace of human life. Yet the road that led down the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hillside seemed well-kept: he could do no more than accept
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 its guidance.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 At th\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e foot of the hill, the road disappeared between great
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 trees that almost hid the sun. As Alvin walked into their
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 shadow, a strange medley of scents and sounds greeted him.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The rustle of the wind among the leaves he had known before,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 but underlying that were a thousand vague noises that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 conveyed nothing to his mind. Unknown odors assailed him,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 smells that had been lost even to the memory of his race.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The warmth, the profusion of scent and color, and the unseen
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 presences of a million li\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ving things, smote him with almost
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 physical violence.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He came upon the lake without any warning. The trees
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to the right suddenly ended, and before him was a great expanse
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of water, dotted with tiny islands. Never in his life
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had Alvin seen such quantities \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the precious liquid: he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 walked to the edge of the lake and let the warm water trickle
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 through his fingers.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The great silver fish that suddenly forced its way through
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the underwater reeds was the first non-human creature he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had ever seen. As it hung in n\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 othingness, its fins a faint blur
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of motion, Alvin wondered why its shape was so startlingly
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 familiar. Then he remembered the records that Jeserac had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 shown him as a child, and knew where he had seen those
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 graceful lines before. Logic told him that the res\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 emblance
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 could only be accidental--but logic was wrong.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 All through the ages, artists had been inspired by the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 urgent beauty of the great ships driving from world to world
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Once there had been craftsmen who had worked, not with
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 crumbling metal or decaying s\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 tone, but with the most im\page AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 47
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 perishable of all materials--flesh and blood and bone. Though
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 they and all their race had been utterly forgotten, one of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 their dreams had survived the ruins of cities and the wreck
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of continents.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 At last Alvin broke the lake's enchantment and continued
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 along the winding road. The forest closed around him once
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 more, but only for a little while. Presently the road ended,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in a great clearing perhaps half a mile wide and twice as long.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Now Alvin unders\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 tood why he had seen no trace of man
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 before.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The clearing was full of low, two-storied buildings, colored
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in soft shades that rested the eye even in the full glare of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the sun. They were of clean, straightforward design, but several
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were built in a complex \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 architectural style involving the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 use of fluted columns and gracefully fretted stone. In these
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 buildings, which seemed of great age, the immeasurably ancient
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 device of the pointed arch was used.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 As he walked slowly towards the village, Alvin was still
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 stru\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ggling to grasp his new surroundings. Nothing was familiar:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 even the air had changed. And the tall, golden-haired
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 people coming and going among the buildings were very different
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 from the languid citizens of Diaspar.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin had almost reached the village whe\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 n he saw a group
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of men coming purposefully towards him. He felt a sudden,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 heady excitement and the blood pounded in his veins. For
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 an instant there flashed through his mind the memory of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 all Man's fateful meetings with other races. Then he. came
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to a halt\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 , a few feet away from the others.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 They seemed surprised to see him, yet not as surprised as
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he had expected. Very quickly he understood why. The leader
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the party extended his hand in the ancient gesture of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 friendship.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We thought it best to meet you here," he said. "Our
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 home is very different from Diaspar, and the walk from the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 terminus gives visitors a chance to become--acclimatized."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin accepted the outstretchd hand, but for a moment
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was too astonished to reply.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Y\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ou knew I was coming?" he gasped at length.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We always know when the carriers start to move. But we did not expect anyone so young. How did you discover
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the way?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I think we'd better restrain our curiosity, Gerane. Seranis
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 is waiting."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The name "Seranis" \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was preceded by a word unfamiliar
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 48 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to Alvin. It somehow conveyed an impression of affection,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 tempered with respect.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Gerane agreed with the speaker and the party began to move into the village. As they walked, Alvin studied the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 faces around him. They appeared kindly and intelligent:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 there were none of the signs of boredom, mental strife, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 faded brilliance he might have found in a similar group in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his own city. To his broadening mind, it seemed that they
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 possessed all that his \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 own people had lost. When they smiled,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 which was often, they revealed lines of ivory teeth--the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 pearls that Man had lost and won and lost again in the long
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 story of evolution.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The people of the village watched with frank curiosity as
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin followed his gui\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 des. He was amazed to see not a few
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 children, who stared at him in grave surprise. No other single
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 fact brought home to him so vividly his remoteness from
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the world he knew. Diaspar had paid, and paid in full, the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 price of immortality.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The party halted before the largest building Alvin had yet
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seen. It stood in the center of the village and from a flagpole
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 on its small circular tower a green pennant floated along the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 breeze.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 All but Cerane dropped behind as he entered the building.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Insid\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e it was quiet and cool: sunlight filtering through the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 translucent walls lit up everything with a soft, restful glow.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The floor was smooth and resilient, inlaid with fine mosaics.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 On the walls, an artist of great ability and power had depicted
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a set of fo\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 rest scenes. Mingled with these paintings
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were other murals which conveyed nothing to Alvin's mind,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 yet were attractive and pleasant to look upon. Let into the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 wall was something he had hardly expected to see--a visi-
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 phone receiver, beautifully made, its \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 idle screen filled with
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a maze of shifting colors.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 They walked together up a short circular stairway that led
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 them out on the flat roof of the building. From this point,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the entire village was visible and Alvin could see that it consisted
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of about a hundre\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 d buildings. In the distance the trees
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 opened out into wide meadows: he could see animals in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 some of the fields but his knowledge of biology was too slight
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for him to guess at their nature.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 In the shadow of the tower, two people were sitting together
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 at a \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 desk, watching him intently. As they rose to greet
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 him, Alvin saw that one was a stately, very handsome woman
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 whose golden hair was shot through with wisps of grey. This,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he knew, must be Seranis. Looking into her eyes, he could
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 49
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sense that wisdom and depth of experience he felt when he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was with- Rorden and, more rarely, with Jeserac.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The other was a boy a little older than himself in appearance,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and Alvin needed no second glance to tell that Seranis
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mu\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 st be his mother. The clear-cut features were the same,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 though the eyes held only friendliness and not that almost
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 frightening wisdom. The hair, too, was different--black instead
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of gold--but no-one could have mistaken the relationship
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 between them.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Feelin\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 g a little overawed, Alvin turned to his guide for sup- port--but Gerane had already vanished. Then Seranis smiled,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and his nervousness left him.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Welcome to Lys," she said. "I am Seranis, and this is my
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 son Theon, who will one day take my place. You are t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 youngest who has ever come to us from Diaspar: tell me
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 how you found the way."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Haltingly at Erst, and then with increasing confidence,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin began his story. Theon followed his words eagerly, for
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Diaspar must have been as strange to him as Lys had been
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to Alvin. But Seranis, Alvin could see, knew all that he was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 telling her, and once or twice she asked questions which
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 showed that in some things at least her knowledge went
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 beyond his own. When he had finished there was silence for
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a while. Then Seranis lo\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 oked at him and said quietly:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Why did you come to Lys?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I wanted to explore the world," he replied. "Everyone
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 told me that there was only desert beyond the city, but I
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 wanted to make sure for myself."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The eyes of Seranis were full of sympathy and even sadness
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 when she spoke again:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "And was that the only reason?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin hesitated. When he answered, it was not the explorer
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 who spoke, but the boy not long removed from childhood.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "No," he said slowly, "it wa\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sn't the only reason, though
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 I did not know until now. I was lonely."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Lonely? In Diaspar?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Yes," said Alvin. "I am the only child to be born there
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for seven thousand years."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Those wonderful eyes were still upon him and, looking
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 into their depths, Alvin h\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ad the sudden conviction that Se- ranis could read his mind. Even as the thought came, he saw
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 an expression of amused surprise pass across her face--and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 knew that his guess had been correct. Once both men and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 machines had possessed this power, and the unch\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 anging ma\page 50 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 chines could still read their master's orders. But in Diaspar,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Man himself had lost the gift he had given to his slaves.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rather quickly, Seranis broke into his thoughts.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "If you are looking for life," she said, "your \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 search has
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ended. Apart from Diaspar, there is only desert beyond our
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mountains."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was strange that Alvin, who had questioned accepted
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 beliefs so often before, did not doubt the words of Seranis.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 His only reaction was one of sadness that all his teaching
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had been so nearly true.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Tell me something about Lys," he asked. "Why have
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 you been cut off from Diaspar for so long, when you know
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 all about us?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Seranis smiled at his question.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "It's not easy to answer that in a few words, but I'll do
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 my best.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Because you have lived in Diaspar all your life, you have
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 come to think of Man as a city-dweller. That isn't true, Al-
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 vin. Since the machines gave us freedom, there has always
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 been a rivalry between two different types of civilization. In
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the Dawn Ages t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 here were thousands of cities, but a large
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 part of mankind lived in communities like this village of ours.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We have no records of the founding of Lys, but we know
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that our remote ancestors disliked city life intensely and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 would have nothing to do with it. \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 In spite of swift and universal transport, they kept themselves largely apart from the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 rest of the world and developed an independent culture which
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was one of the highest the race had ever known.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Through the ages, as we advanced along our different
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 roads,\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  the gulf between Lys and the cities widened. It was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 bridged only in times of great crisis: we know that when the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Moon was falling, its destruction was planned and carried out
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 by the scientists of Lys. So too was the defense of Earth
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 against the Invaders, \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 whom we held at the Battle of Shalmirane.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "That great ordeal exhausted mankind: one by one the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 cities died and the desert rolled over them. As the population
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 fell, humanity began the migration which was to make Dia-
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 spar the last and greatest of all citie\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 s.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Most of these changes passed us by, but we had our own
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 battle to fight--the battle against the desert. The natural
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 barrier of the mountains was not enough, and many thousands
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of years passed before we had made our land secure.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Far beneath Lys are machines which will give us water as

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 long as the world remains, for the old oceans are still there,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 miles down in the Earth's crust.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "That, very briefly, is our history. You will see that even
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in the Dawn A\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ges we had little to do with the cities, though
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 their people often came into our land. We never hindered
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 them, for many of our greatest men came from Outside, but
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 when the cities were dying we did not wish to be involved
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in their downfall. With the ending \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of air transport, there
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was only one way into Lys--the carrier svstem from Diaspar.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Four hundred million years ago that was closed by mutual
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 agreement. But we have remembered Diaspar, and I do not
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 know why you have forgotten Lys."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Seranis smiled, a little \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 wryly.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Diaspar has surprised us. We expected it to go the way
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of all other cities, but instead it has achieved a stable culture
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that may last as long as Earth. It is not a culture we admire,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 yet we are glad that those who wished to escape have been
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 able t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 o do so. More than you might think have made the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 journey, and they have almost all been outstanding men."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin wondered how Seranis could be so sure of her facts,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and he did not approve of her attitude towards Diaspar. He
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had hardly "escaped"--yet, after \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 all, the word was not altogether
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 inaccurate.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Somewhere a great bell vibrated with a throbbing boom
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that ebbed and died in the still air. Six times it struck, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 as the last note faded into silence Alvin realized that the sun
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was low on the horizon and the eastern sky already held a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hint of night.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I must return to Diaspar," he said. "Rorden is expecting
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 me."

\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 SERANIS LOOKED AT HIM THOUGHTFULLY FOR A MOMENT.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Then she rose to her feet and walked towards the s\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 tairway.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Please wait a little while," she said. "I have some business
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to settle and Theon, I know, has many questions to ask you "
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Then she was gone, and for the next few minutes Theon's
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 barrage of questions drove any other thoughts from his mind.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Theon h\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ad heard of Diaspar, and had seen records of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 cities as they were at the height of their glory, but he could
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 not imagine how their inhabitants had passed their lives.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin was amused at many of his questions--until he realized
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that his own ignorance of\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  Lys was even greater.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Seranis was gone for many minutes, but her expression
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 revealed nothing when she returned.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We have been talking about you," she said--not explaining
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 who "we" might be: "If you return to Diaspar, the whole

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 secret could not be kept."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 A feeling of slight panic began to creep over Alvin. Seranis
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 must have known his thoughts for her next words were more
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 reassuring.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We don't wish to keep you here against your wishes, but
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 if you return to Diaspar we will have to erase all memories
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of Lys from your mind." She hesitated for a moment. "This
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 has never arisen before: all your predecessors came here to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 stay."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin was thinking deeply.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Why should it matter," he said, "if Diaspar\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  does learn
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 about you again? Surely it would be a good thing for both
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 our peoples?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Seranis looked displeased.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We don't think so," she said. "If the gates were opened,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 our land would be flooded with sensation seekers and the 55

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 idly curious. As things are now, only the best of your people
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 have ever reached us."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin felt himself becoming steadily more annoyed, but he realized that Seranis' attitude was quite unconscious.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "That isn't true," he said flatly. "Very few of us woul\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 d
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ever leave Diaspar. If you let me return, it would make no
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 difference to Lys."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "The decision is not in my hands," replied Seranis, "but
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 I will put it to the Council when it meets in three days from
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 now. Until then, you can remain as my guest and Theon
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 wi\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ll show you our country."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I would like to do that," said Alvin, "but Rorden will be
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 waiting for me. He knows where I am, and if I don't come
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 back at once anything may happen."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Seranis smiled slightly.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We have given that a good deal of thought." she admitted.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "There are men working on the problem now--we
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 will see if they have been successful."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin was annoyed at having overlooked something so obvious.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He knew that the engineers of the past had built f\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 or
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 eternity--his journey to Lys had been proof of that. Yet it
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 gave him a shock when the chromatic mist on the visiphone
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 screen drifted aside to show the familiar outlines of Rorden's room.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The Keeper of the Records looked up from his desk. His
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 eyes lit wh\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 en he saw Alvin.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I never expected you to be early," he said--though there
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was relief behind the jesting words. "Shall I come to meet
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 you?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 While Alvin hesitated, Seranis stepped forward and Ror-
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 den saw her for the Erst time. His eyes widened and he leane\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 d
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 forward as if to obtain a better view. The movement was as
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 useless as it was automatic: Man had not lost it even though
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he had used the visiphone for a thousand million years.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Seranis laid her hands on Alvin's shoulders and began to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 speak. When she had B\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 nished Rorden was silent for a while.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I'll do my best," he said at length. "As I understand it, the choice lies between sending Alvin back to us under some
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 form of hypnosis--or returning him with no restrictions at
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 all. But I think I can promise that even\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  if it learns of your
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 existence, Diaspar will continue to ignore you."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We don't overlook that possibility," Seranis replied with
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 just a trace of pique. Rorden detected it instantly.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "And what of myself?" he asked with a smile. "I know as
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 much as Alvin now."
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 57
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Alvin is a boy," replied. Seranis quickly, "but you hold
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 an office as ancient as Diaspai. This is not the first time Lys
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 has spoken to the Keeper of the Records, and he has never
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 betrayed our secret yet."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden made no comment: he merely said: "How long do
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 you wish to keep Alvin?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "At the most, five days. The Council meets three days
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 from now."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Very well: for the next five days, then, Alvin is extremely
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 busy on some historical research with me. This won't\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  be the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 first time it's happened--but we'll have to be out if Jeserac
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 calls."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin laughed.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Poor Jeserac! I seem to spend half my life hiding things
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 from him."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "You've been much less successful than you think," replied
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden, somewhat disconcertingly. "\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 However, I don't expect
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 any trouble. But don't be longer than the five days'"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 When the picture had faded, Rorden sat for a while staring
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 at the darkened screen. He had always suspected that the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 world communication network might still be in existence,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 but t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he keys to its operation had been lost and the billions
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of circuits could never be traced by man. It was strange to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 reflect that even now visiphones might be called vainly in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the lost cities. Perhaps the time would come when his own
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 receiver would do the s\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ame, and there would be no Keeper
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the Records to answer the unknown caller. . . .
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He began to feel afraid. The immensity of what had happened
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was slowly dawning upon him. Until now, Rorden had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 given little thought to the consequences of his actions. His
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 own historical interests, and his affection for Alvin, had been
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sufficient motive for what he had done. Though he had humored
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and encouraged Alvin, he had never believed that anything
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 like this could possibly happen.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Despite the centuries between them, th\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e boy's will had always
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 been more powerful than his own. It was too late to do
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 anything about it now: Rorden felt that events were sweeping
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 him along towards a climax utterly beyond his control.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "B ALL THIS REALLY NECESSARY," SAID ALVIN, "IF WE ARE
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 only go\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ing to be away for two or three days? After all, we
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 have a synthesizer with us."
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 58 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Probably not," answered Theon, throwing the last food-
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 containers into the little ground-car. "It may seem an odd
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 custom, but we've never synthe\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sized some of our Enest foods
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 --we like to watch them grow. Also, we may meet other
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 parties and it's polite to exchange food with them. Nearly
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 every district has some special product, and Airlee is famous
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for its peaches. That's why I've put so many aboard\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 --not
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 because I think that even you can eat them all."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin threw his half-eaten peach at Theon, who dodged
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 quickly aside. There came a flicker of iridescence and a faint
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 whirring of invisible wings as Krif descended upon the fruit
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and began to sip its ju\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ices.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin was still not quite used to Krif. It was hard for him
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to realize that the great insect, though it would come when
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 called and would--sometimes--obey simple orders, was almost
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 wholly mindless. Life, to Alvin, had always been synonymous
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 with intelligence--sometimes intelligence far higher
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 than man's.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 When Krif was resting, his six gauzy wings lay folded along
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his body, which glittered through them like a jewelled scepter.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He was at once the highest and the most beautiful form of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 insect li\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 fe the world had ever known--the latest and perhaps
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the last of all the creatures Man had chosen for his companionship.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Lys was full of such surprises, as Alvin was continually
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 learning. Its inconspicuous but efficient transport system had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 been equally un\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 expected. The ground-car apparently worked
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 on the same principle as the machine that had brought him
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 from Diaspar, for it floated in the air a few inches above the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 turf. Although there was no sign of any guide-rail, Theon
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 told him that the cars could only \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 run on predetermined
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 tracks. All the centres of population were thus linked together,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 but the remoter parts of the country could only be
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 reached on foot. This state of affairs seemed altogether extraordinary
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to Alvin, but Theon appeared to think it was an
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 excellent idea.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Apparently Theon had been planning this expedition for
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a considerable time. Natural history was his chief passion--
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Krif was only the most spectacular of his many pets--and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he hoped to find new types of insect life in the uninhabited
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 southern parts of Lys.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The project had filled Alvin with enthusiasm when he heard
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of it. He looked forward to seeing more of this wonderful
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 country, and although Theon's interests lay in a different
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 FR1;AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 59
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 field of knowledge from\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  his own, he felt a kinship for his new
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 companion which not even Rorden had ever awakened.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Theon intended to travel south as far as the machine could
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 go--little more than an hour's journey from Airlee--and the rest of the way they would have to go on foot.\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  Not realizing
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the full implications of this, Alvin had no objections.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 To Alvin, the journey across Lys had a dream-like unreality.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Silent as a ghost, the machine slid across rolling plains and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 wound its way through forests, never deviating from its invisi\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ble
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 tracks. It travelled perhaps a dozen times as fast as a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 man could comfortably walk. No one in Lys was ever in a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 greater hurry than that.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Many times they passed through villages, some larger than
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Airlee but most built along very similar lines. Alvin was\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  interested
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to notice subtle but significant differences in clothing
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and even physical appearance as they moved from one community
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to the next. The civilization of Lys was composed of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hundreds of distinct cultures, each contributing some special
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 talent tow\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ards the whole.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Once or twice Theon stopped to speak to friends, but the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 pauses were brief and it was still morning when the little
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 machine came to rest among the foothills of a heavily wooded
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mountain. It was not a very large mountain, but Alvin thought
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 i\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 t the most tremendous thing he had ever seen.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "This is where we start to walk," said Theon cheerfully,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 throwing equipment out of the car. "We can't ride any
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 further."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 As he fumbled with the straps that were to convert him
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 into a beast of burden, Alvin looked doubtfully at the great
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mass of rock before them.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "It's a long way round, isn't it?" he queried.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We aren't going round," replied Theon. "I want to get
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to the top before nightfall."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin said nothing. He had been rathe\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 r afraid of this.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 FROM HERE, SAID THEON, RAISING HIS VOICE TO MAKE IT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 heard above the thunder of the waterfall, "you can see the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 whole of Lys."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin could well believe him. To the north lay mile upon
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mile of forest, broken here and there by clearings and \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 fields
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and the wandering threads of a hundred rivers. Hidden somewhere
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in that vast panorama was the village of Airlee. Alvin
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 60 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 fancied that he could catch a glimpse of the great lake, but
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 decided that his eyes had tricked him. \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Still further north,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 trees and clearings alike were lost in a mottled carpet of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 green, rucked here and there by lines of hills. And beyond
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that, at the very edge of vision, the mountains that hemmed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Lys from the desert lay like a bank of distant clouds.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Ea\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 st and west the view was little different, but to the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 south the mountains seemed only a few miles away. Alvin
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 could see them very clearly, and he realized that they were
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 far higher than the little peak on which he was standing.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 But more wonderful even than these was the waterfall.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 From the sheer face of the mountain a mighty ribbon of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 water leaped far out over the valley, curving down through
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 space towards the rocks a thousand feet below. There it was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 lost in a shimmering mist of\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  spray, while up from the depths
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 rose a ceaseless, drumming thunder that reverberated in hollow
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 echoes from the mountain walls. And quivering in the air
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 above the base of the fall was the last rainbow left on Earth.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 For long minutes the two boys lay on the\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  edge of the cliff,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 gazing at this last Niagara and the unknown land beyond.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was very different from the country they had left, for in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 some indefinable way it seemed deserted and empty. Man
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had not lived here for many, many years.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Theon answered his fri\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 end's unspoken question.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Once the whole of Lys was inhabited," he said, "but that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was a very long time ago. Only the animals live here now."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Indeed, there was nowhere any sign of human life\hich\f39 \emdash \loch\f39 none
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the clearings or well-disciplined rivers that spoke of Ma\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 n's
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 presence. Only in one spot was there any indication that he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had ever lived here, for many miles away a solitary white ruin
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 jutted above the forest roof like a broken fang. Elsewhere,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the jungle had returned to its own.

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 THE CRATER DWELLER
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 IT WAS NIG\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 HT WHEN ALVIN AWOKE, THE UTTER NIGHT OF
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mountain country, terrifying in its intensity. Something had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 disturbed him, some whisper of sound that had crept into
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his mind above the dull thunder of the falls. He sat up in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the darkness, straining his eyes across the hidden land, while
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 with indrawn breath he listened to the drumming roar of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the falls and the faint but unending rustle of life in the trees
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 around him.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Nothing was visible. The starlight was too dim to reveal
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  miles of country that lay hundreds of feet below: only
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a jagged line of darker night eclipsing the stars told of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mountains on the southern horizon. In the darkness beside
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 him Alvin heard his friend roll over and sit up.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "What is it?" came a whispered \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 voice.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I thought I heard a noise."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "What sort of noise?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I don't know. Perhaps I was only dreaming."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There was silence while two pairs of eyes peered out into
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the mystery of night. Then, suddenly, Theon caught his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 friend's arm.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Look!" he whispered.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Far \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to the south glowed a solitary point of light, too low
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in the heavens to be a star. It was a brilliant white, tinged
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 with violet, and as the boys watched it began to climb the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 spectrum of intensity, until the eye could no longer bear to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 look upon it. Then \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it exploded\hich\f39 \emdash \loch\f39 and it seemed as if lightning
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had struck below the rim of the world. For an instant the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mountains, and the great land -they guarded, were etched
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 with Ere against the darkness of the night. Ages later came
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the echo of a mighty explosion, and in \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the forest below a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 63
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 64 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sudden wind stirred among the trees. It died away swiftly,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and one by one the routed stars crept back into the sky.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 For the Erst time in his life, Alvin knew that fear of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 unknown that had been the curse of ancient man. It was a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 feeling so strange that for a while he could not even give it a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 name. In the moment of recognition it vanished and he became
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 himself again.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "What is it?" he whispered.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There was a pause so long that \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he repeated the question.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I'm trying to remember," said Theon, and was silent for
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a while. A little later he spoke again.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "That must be Shalmirane," he said simply.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Shalmirane! Does it still exist?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I'd almost forgotten," replied Theon, "but it's coming
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 back now. Mother once told me that the fortress lies in those
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mountains. Of course, it's been in ruins for ages, but someone
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 is still supposed to live there."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Shalmirane! To these children of two races, so widely differing
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in culture and history, this was\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  indeed a name of magic.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 In all the long story of Earth there had been no greater epic
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 than the defense of Shalmirane against an invader who had conquered all the Universe.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Presently Theon's voice came again out of the darkness.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "The people of the south co\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 uld tell us more. We will ask
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 them on our way back."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin scarcely heard him: he was deep in his own thoughts,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 remembering stories that Rorden had told him long ago.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The Battle of Shalmirane lay at the dawn of recorded history:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it marked the end of the le\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 gendary ages of Man's conquests,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and the beginning of his long decline. In Shalmirane,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 if anywhere on Earth, lay the answers to the problems that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had tormented him for so many years. But the southern
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mountains were very far away.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Theon must have shared something of his mother's powers,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for he said quietly:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "If we started at dawn, we could reach the fortress by
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 nightfall. I've never been there, but I think I could End the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 way."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin thought it over. He was tired, his feet were sore\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 , and the muscles of his thighs were aching with the unaccustomed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 effort. It was very tempting to leave it until another
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 time. Yet there might be no other time, and there was even. the possibility that the actinic explosion had been a signal
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for help.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Bene\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ath the dim light of the failing stars, Alvin wrestled
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 65
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 with his thoughts and presently made his decision. Nothing
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had changed: the mountains resumed their watch over the sleeping land. But a turning-point in history had come a\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 nd
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 gone, and the human race was moving towards a strange
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 new future.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The sun had just lifted above the eastern wall of Lys when
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 they reached the outskirts of the forest. Here, nature had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 returned to her own. Even Theon seemed lost among the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 gigantic trees \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that blocked the sunlight and cast pools of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 shadow on the jungle floor. Fortunately the river from the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 fall flowed south in a line too straight to be altogether natural,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and by keeping to its edge they could avoid the denser
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 undergrowth. A good deal of The\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 on's time was spent in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 controlling Krif, who disappeared occasionally into the jungle
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 or went skimming wildly across the water. Even Alvin, to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 whom everything was still so new, could feel that the forest
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had a fascination not possessed by the smaller, more cultivated
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 woods of northern Lys. Few trees were alike: most of.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 them were in various stages of devolution and some had reverted
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 through the ages almost to their original, natural forms.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Many were obviou\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sly not of Earth at all--perhaps not even
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the Solar System. Watching like sentinels over the lesser
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 trees were giant sequoias, three or four hundred feet high.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 They had once been called the oldest things on Earth: they
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were still a little older than Man.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The river was widening now: ever and again it opened into small lakes, upon which tiny islands lay at anchor. There
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were insects here, brilliantly colored creatures swinging aimlessly
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to and fro over the surface of the water. Once, despite
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Theon's shouts\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 , Krif darted away to join his distant cousins.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He disappeared instantly in a cloud of glittering wings, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the sound of angry buzzing floated towards them. A moment
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 later the cloud erupted and Krif came back across the water,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 almost too quickly for the e\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ye to follow. Thereafter he kept
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 very close to Theon and did not stray again.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Towards evening they caught occasional glimpses of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mountains ahead. The river that had been so faithful a guide
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was flowing sluggishly now, as if it too were nearing the end \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 its journey. But it was clear that they could not reach the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mountains by nightfall: well before sunset the forest had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 become so dark that further progress was impossible. The
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 great trees lay in pools of shadow, and a cold wind was sweeping
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 through the l\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 eaves. Alvin and Theon settled down for
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the night beside a giant redwood whose topmost branches
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were still ablaze with sunlight.
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 66 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 When at last the hidden sun went down, the light still
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 lingered on the dancing waters. The two boys lay in the gathering
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 gloom, watching the river and thinking of all that they
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had seen. As Alvin fell asleep, he found himself wondering
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 who last had come this way, and how long since.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The sun was high when they \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 left the forest and stood at
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 last before the mountain walls of Lys. Ahead of them the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ground rose steeply to the sky in waves of barren rock. Here
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the river came to an end as spectacular as its beginning, for
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the ground opened in its path and it sank roari\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ng from sight.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 For a moment Theon stood looking at the whirlpool and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the broken land beyond. Then he pointed to a gap in the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hills.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Shalmirane lies in that direction," he said confidently.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin looked at him in surprise.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "You told me you'd never been her\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e beforel"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I haven't."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Then how do you know the way?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Theon looked puzzled.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I don't know--I've never thought about it before. It must
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 be a kind of instinct, for wherever we go in Lys we always
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 know our way about."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin found this very difficult to beli\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 eve, and followed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Theon with considerable skepticism. They were soon through
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the gap in the hills, and ahead of them now was a curious
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 plateau with gently sloping sides. After a moment's hesitation.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Theon started to climb. Alvin followed, full of doubts,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and as he climbed he began to compose a little speech. If
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the journey proved in vain, Theon would know exactly what
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he thought of his unerring instinct.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 As they approached the summit, the nature of the ground
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 altered abruptly. The lower slopes had consiste\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 d of porous,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 volcanic stone, piled here and there in great mounds of slag.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Now the surface turned suddenly to hard sheets of glass,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 smooth and treacherous, as if the rock had once run in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 molten rivers down the mountain. The rim of the plateau
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was almost at\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  their feet. Theon reached it first, and a few
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seconds later Alvin overtook him and stood speechless at his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 side. For they stood on the edge, not of the plateau they
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had expected, but of a giant bowl half a mile deep and three
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 miles in diameter. Ahead of t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hem the ground plunged steeply
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 downwards, slowly levelling out at the bottom of valley and

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 black as the rock of a world that had never known a sun
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Nor was that all, for lying beneath their feet and ringing
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the entire crater was a seamless band o\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 f metal, some hundred
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 feet wide, tarnished by immeasurable age but still showing
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 no slightest trace of corrosion.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 As their eyes grew accustomed to the unearthly scene, Al-
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 vin and Theon realized that the blackness of the bowl wis
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 not as absolute as they had thought. Here and there, so fugitive
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that they could only see them indirectly, tiny explosions
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of light were flickering in the ebon walls. They came at random,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 vanishing as soon as they were born, like the reflections
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of stars o\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 n a broken sea.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "It's wonderful!" gasped Alvin. "But what is it?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "It looks like a reflector of some kind."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I can't imagine that black stuff reflecting anything."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "It's only black to our eyes, remember. We don't know
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 what radiations they used."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "But surel\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 y there's more than this! Where is the fortress?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Theon pointed to the level floor of the crater, where lay
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 what Alvin had taken to be a pile of jumbled stones. As he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 looked again, he could make out an almost obliterated plan
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 behind the grouping of the gre\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 at blocks. Yes, there lay the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ruins of once mighty buildings, overthrown by time.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 For the first few hundred yards the walls were too smooth
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and steep for the boys to stand upright, but after a little
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 while they reached the gentler slopes and could walk wit\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hout
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 difficulty. Near the bottom of the crater the smooth ebony
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of its surface ended in a thin layer of soil, which the winds
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of Lys must have brought here through the ages.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 A quarter of a mile away, titanic blocks of stone were piled
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 one upon the other, l\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ike the discarded toys of an infant giant.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Here, a section of a massive wall was still recognizable: there,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 two carven obelisks marked what had once been a mighty
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 entrance. Everywhere grew mosses and creeping plants, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 tiny stunted trees. Even the wind was hushed.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 So Alvin and Theon came to the ruins of Shalmirane,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Against those walls, if legend spoke the truth, forces that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 could shatter a world to dust had flamed and thundered
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and been utterly defeated. Once these peace\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ful skies had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 blazed with fires torn from the hearts of suns, and the

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the fury of their masters.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 No one had ever captured Shalmirane. But now the

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the generations of blindly burrowing worms.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Overawed by its majesty, the two boys walked in silence
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 towards the colossal wreck. They passed into the shado\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 w of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a broken wall, and entered a canyon where the mountains
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of stone had split asunder.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Before them lay a great amphitheater, crossed and crisscrossed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 with long mounds of rubble that must mark the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 graves of buried machines. Once the whole of this tremendo\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 us
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 space had been vaulted, but the root had long since
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 collapsed. Yet life must still exist somewhere among the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 desolation, and Alvin realized that even this ruin might
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 lie no more than superficial. The greater part of the fortress
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 would be far underground\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 , beyond the reach of Time.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We'll have to turn back by noon," said Theon, "so we
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mustn't stay too long. It would be quicker if we separated.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 I'll take the eastern half and you can'explore this side. Shout
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 if you find anything interesting--but don't get too far
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 away."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 So they separated, and Alvin began to climb over the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 rubble, skirting the larger mounds of stone. Near the center
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the arena he came suddenly upon a small circular clearing,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 thirty or forty f\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 eet in diameter. It had been covered with
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 weeds, but they were now blackened and charred by tremendous
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 heat, so that they crumbled to ashes at his approach.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 At the centre of the clearing stood a tripod supporting a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 polished metal bowl, not unlike a model o\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 f Shalmirane itself.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was capable of movement in altitude and azimuth, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a spiral of some transparent substance was supported at its
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 centre. Beneath the reflector was welded a black box from
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 which a thin cable wandered away across the ground.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was cl\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ear to Alvin that this machine must be the source
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the light, and he began to trace the cable. It was not
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 too easy to follow the slender wire, which had a habit of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 diving into crevasses and reappearing at unexpected places.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Finally he lost it altogether \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and shouted to Theon to come
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and help him.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He was crawling under an overhanging rock when a shadow
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 suddenly blotted out the light. Thinking it was his friend,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin emerged from the cave and turned to speak. But the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 words died abruptly on his lips.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Hanging\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  in the air before him was a great dark eye
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 surrounded by a satellite system of smaller eyes. Th.it, at
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 least, was Alvin's first impression: then he realized that he
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 69
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was looking at a complex machine--and it was looking at
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 him.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin broke the painful silence All his life he had given
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 orders to machines, and although he had never seen anything
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 quite like this creature, he decided that it was probably
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 intelligent.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Reverse," he ordered experimentally.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Nothing happened.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Go. Come.\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  Rise. Fall. Advance."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 None of the conventional control thoughts produced any
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 effect. The machine remained contemptuously inactive
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin took a step forward, and the eyes retreated in some
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 haste. Unfortunately, their angle of vision seemel somewhat
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 limited\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 , for the machine came to a sudden halt agauut Theon, who for the last minute had been an interested
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 spectator. With a perfectly human ejaculation, the wh )le
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 apparatus shot twenty feet into the air, revealing a set of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 tentacles and jointed limbs clusterin\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 g round a stubby cylin

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Come down--we won't hurt you!" called Theon, rubbing
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a bruise on his chest.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Something spoke: not the passionless, crystal-clear voice
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of a machine, but the quavering speech of a very old and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 very tired man.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Who are you\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ? What are you doing in Shalmirane?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "My name is Theon, and this is my friend, Alvin of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Loronei. We're exploring Southern Lys."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There was a brief pause. When the machine spoke again
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 its voice held an unmistakable note of petulance and annoyance.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Why can't you leave me in peace? You know how often
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 I've asked to be left alonel"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Theon, usually good-natured, bristled visibly.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We're from Airlee, and we don't know anything about
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Shalmirane."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Besides," Alvin added reproachfully, "we saw your light
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  thought you might be signalling for help."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was strange to hear so human a sigh from the coldly
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 impersonal machine.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "A million times I must have signalled now, and all I
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 have ever done is to draw the inquisitive from Lys But I see
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 you meant no harm. Fol\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 low me."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The machine floated slowly away over the broken stones,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 coming to rest before a dark opening in the ruined wall
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the amphitheater. In the shadow of the cave something
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 70 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 moved, and a human figure stepped into the sunli\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ght. He
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was the first physically old man Alvin had ever seen. His

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hair coveied all the lower part of his face. A cloak of woven
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 glass was thrown carelessly over his shoulders, and on either
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 side of\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  him floated two more of the strange, many-eyed

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 echoed his voice for a moment until something
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 switched them off.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "So you are from the North, and your people have already

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was painful to watch, he hobbled through the doorway and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 disappeared, the three machines floating silently after him.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin and Theon looked at each other in surprise- they did

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Then it vanished again.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin shrugged his sh\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 oulders.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We appear to be invited. I think our host's a little

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 From the opening in the wall a wide spiral stairway led
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 downwards for a score of feet. It ended in a small circular

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 field flickered over the table and their host waved silently
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 towards it. They thanked him formal\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ly and began to sample
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the food and drink that had suddenly appeared. Alvin realized
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that he had grown a little tired of the unvarying output from Theon's portable synthesizer and the change was very welcome.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 They ate in silence for a while, stealing a gl\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ance now and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 then at the old man. He seemed sunk in his own thoughts
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and appeared to have forgotten them completely--but as
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 soon as they had finished he looked up and began to question
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 them. When Alvin explained that he was a native not of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Lys but of Diasp\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ar, the old fellow showed no particular
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 surprise. Theon did his best to deal with the queries: for
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 one who disliked visitors, their host seemed very anxious
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to have news of the outer world. Alvin quickly decided that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his earlier attitude must have been a pose.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Presently he fell silent again. The two boys waited with
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 what patience .they could: he had told them nothing of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 himself or what he was doing in Shalmirane. The light-
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 signal that had drawn them there was still as\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  great a mystery
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 as ever, yet they did not care to ask outright for an
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 explanation. So they sat in an uncomfortable silence, their
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 eyes wandering round that amazing room, finding something
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 new and unexpected at every moment. At last Alvin broke
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 into the ol\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 d man's reverie.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We must leave soon," he remarked.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was not a statement so much as a hint. The wrinkled
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 face turned towards him but the eyes were still very far
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 away. Then the tired, infinitely ancient voice began to speak.
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 75
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was so quiet and low that at first they could scarcely hear:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 after a while the old man must have noticed their difficulty,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for of a sudden the three machines began once more to echo
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his words.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Much that he told them they could never understand.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Sometim\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 es he used words which were unknown to them:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 at other times he spoke as if repeating sentences or whole
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 speeches that others must have written long ago. But the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 main outlines of the story were clear, and they took Alvin's
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 thoughts back to the ages of which\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  he had dreamed since his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 childhood.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The tale began, like so many others, amid the chaos of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the Transition Centuries, when the Invaders had gone but
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the world was still recovering from its wounds. At that time
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 there appeared in Lys the man who later became known as
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the Master. He was accompanied by three strange machines
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 --the very ones that were watching them now--which acted
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 as his servants and also possessed definite intelligences of their
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 own. His origin was\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  a secret he never disclosed, and eventually
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it was assumed that he had come from space, somehow
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 penetrating the blockade of the Invaders. Far away among
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the stars there might still be islands of humanity which the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 tide of war had not yet engulfed.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The Mas\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ter and his machines possessed powers which
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the world had lost, and around him he gathered a group
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of men to whom he taught much wisdom. His personality
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 must have been a very striking one, and Alvin could understand
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 dimly the magnetism that had drawn so ma\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ny to him.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 From the dying cities, men had come to Lys in their
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 thousands, seeking rest and peace of mind after the years
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of confusion. Here among the forests and mountains, listening
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to the Master's words, they found that peace at last.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 At the close of his\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  long life the Master had asked his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 friends to carry him out into the open so that he could
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 watch the stars. He had waited, his strength waning, until
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the culmination of the Seven Suns. As he died the resolution
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 with which he had kept his secret so long se\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 emed to weaken,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and he babbled many things of which countless books were
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to be written in future ages. Again and again he spoke of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the "Great Ones" who had now left the world but who
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 would surely one day return, and he charged his followers
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to remain to greet them when they came. Those were his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 last rational words. He was never again conscious of his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 surroundings, but just before the end he uttered one phrase
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that revealed part at least of his secret and had come down
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 76 AGAINST THE FALL OF \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the ages to haunt the minds of all who heard it: "It is
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 lovely to watch the colored shadows on the planets of eternal
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 light" Then he died.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 So arose the religion of the Great Ones, for a religion it now became. At the Master's death many of his follow\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ers
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 broke away, but others remained faithful to his teachings,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 which they slowly elaborated through the ages. At first they
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 believed that the Great Ones, whoever they were, would
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 soon return to Earth, but that hope faded with the passing
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 centuries. Yet the\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  brotherhood continued, gathering new
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 members from the lands around, and slowly its strength and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 power increased until it dominated the whole of Southern
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Lys.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was very hard for Alvin to follow the old man's narrative.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The words were used so strangely th\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 at he could not
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 tell what was truth and what legend--if, indeed, the story- held any truth at all. He had only a confused picture of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 generations of fanatical men, waiting for some great event
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 which they did not understand to take place at some unknown
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 futu\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 re date.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The Great Ones never returned. Slowly the power of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 movement failed, and the people of Lys drove it into the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mountains until it took refuge in Shalmirane. Even then
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the watchers did not lose their faith, but swore that however
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 long the wait they would be ready when the Great Ones
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 came. Long ago men had learned one way of defying Time,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and the knowledge had survived when so much else had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 been lost. Leaving only a few of their number to watch over
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Shalmirane, the rest went into th\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e dreamless sleep of suspended
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 animation.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Their numbers slowly falling as sleepers were awakened
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to replace those who died, the watchers kept faith with tlie
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Master. From his dying words it seemed certain that the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Great Ones lived on the planets of the Sev\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 en Suns, and in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 later years attempts were made to send signals into space.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Long ago the signalling had become no more than a meaningless
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ritual, and now the story was nearing its end. In a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 very little while only the three machines would be left in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Shalmira\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ne, watching over the bones of the men who had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 come here so long ago in a cause that they alone could
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 understand.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The thin voice died away, and -Alvin's thoughts returned
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to the world he knew. More than ever before the extent of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his ignorance overwhelmed h\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 im. A tiny fragment of the
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 77
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 past had been illuminated for a little while, but now the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 darkness had closed over it again.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The world's history was a mass of such disconnected
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 threads, and none could say which were important and w\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hich
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were trivial. This fantastic tale of the Master and the Great
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Ones might be no more than another of the countless legends
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that had somehow survived from the civilizations of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Dawn. Yet the three machines were unlike any that Alvin
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had ever seen. He could not dismiss the whole story, as he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had been tempted to do, as a fable built of self-delusion
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 upon a foundation of madness.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "These machines," he said abruptly, "surely they've been
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 questioned? If they came to Earth with the Master, t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hey
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 must still know his secrets."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The old man smiled wearily.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "They know," he said, "but they will never speak. The
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Master saw to that before he handed over the control. We
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 have tried times without number, but it is useless."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin understood. He thought o\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 f the Associator in Diaspar,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and the seals that Alaine had set upon its knowledge. Even
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 those seals, he now believed, could be broken in time, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the Master Associator must be infinitely more complex than
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 these little robot slaves. He wondered if Rorden, \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 so skilled
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in unravelling the secrets of the past, would be able to wrest
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the machines' hidden knowledge from them. But Rorden
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was far away and would never leave Diaspar.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Quite suddenly the plan came fully fledged into his mind.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Only a very young person co\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 uld ever have thought of it, and it taxed even Alvin's self-confidence to the utmost. Yet
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 once the decision had been made, he moved with determination
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and much cunning to his goal.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He pointed towards the three machines.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Are they identical?" he asked. "I m\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ean, can each one
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 do everything, or are they specialized in any way?
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The old man looked a little puzzled.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I've never thought about it," he said. "When I need
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 anything, I ask whichever is most convenient. I don't think
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 there is any difference between them."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "There can't be a great deal of work for them to do
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 now," Alvin continued innocently. Theon looked a little
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 startled, but Alvin carefully avoided his friend's eye. The
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 old man answered guilelessly.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "No," he replied sa\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 dly, "Shalmirane is very different now."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin paused in sympathy: then, very quickly, he began to talk. At first the old man did not seem to grasp his
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 78 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 proposal- later, when comprehension came, Alvin gave him
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 no time to interr\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 upt. He spoke of the great storehouses of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 knowledge in Diaspar, and the skill with which the Keeper
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the Records could use them. Although the Master's machines
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had withstood all other enquirers, they might yield
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 their secrets to Rorden's probing. It woul\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 d be a tragedy if
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the chance were missed, for it would never come again.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Flushed with the heat of his own oratory, Alvin ended
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his appeal:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Lend me one of the machines--you do not need them
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 all. Order it to obey my controls and I will take it to Dias-
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 par.\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  I promise to return it whether the experiment succeeds
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 or not."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Even Theon looked shocked and an expression of horror
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 came across the old man's face.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I couldn't do that!" he gasped.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "But why not? Think what we might learnI"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The other shook his head 6rmly.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "It would be against the Master's wishes."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin was disappointed--disappointed and annoyed. But
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he was young, and his opponent was old and tired. He began
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 again to go through the argument, shifting his attack and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 pressing h\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ome each advantage. And now for the first time
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Theon saw an Alvin he had never suspected before--a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 personality, indeed, that was surprising Alvin himself. The
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 men of the Dawn Ages had never let obstacles bar their way
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for long, and the will-power and deter\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mination that had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 been their heritage had not yet passed from Earth. Even

\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 THE EVENING WAS FAR ADVANCED WHEN THE GROUND-CAR
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 slid silently through the last screen of trees and came to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 rest in the great glade of Airlee. The argument, whic\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 h had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 lasted most of the journey, had now died away and peace
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had been restored. They had never quite come to blows,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 perhaps because the odds were so unequal. Theon had only
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Krif to support him, but Alvin could call upon the argus-
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 eyed, many-tentacled mac\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hine he still regarded so lovingly.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Theon had not minced his words. He had called his friend
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a bully and had told Alvin that he should be thoroughly
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ashamed of himself. But Alvin had only laughed and continued
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to play with his new toy. He did not know how the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 transfer had been effected, but he alone could control the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 robot now, could speak with its voice and see through its
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 eyes. It would obey no one else in all the world.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Seranis was waiting for them in a surpr\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ising room which
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seemed to have no ceiling, though Alvin knew that there
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was a floor above it. She seemed to be worried and more uncertain
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 than he had ever seen her before, and he remembered
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the choice that might soon lie before him. Until now he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had almos\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 t forgotten it. He had believed that, somehow,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the Council would resolve the difficulty. Now he realized
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that its decision might not be to his liking.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The voice of Seranis was troubled when she began to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 speak, and from her occasional pauses Alvin could tel\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 l that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 she was repeating words already rehearsed.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Alvin," she began, "there are many things I did not tell
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 you before, but which you must learn now if you are to

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the depths of every human mind, turned your people against
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the world and made them lose themselves in their own
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 dreams. Here in Lys that fear has never been so great,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 although we bo\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 re the burden of the attack. We had a better
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 reason for our actions, and what we did, we did with open
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 eyes.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Long ago, Alvin, men sought immortality and at last
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 achieved it. They forgot that a world which had banished
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 death must also banish birth. The power to extend his life
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 inde6nitely brought contentment to the individual but stagnation
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to the race. You once told me that you were the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 only child to be born in Diaspar for seven thousand years--

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 follows the false dream. That is why our ways parted--and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 why they must never meet again."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Although the words had been more than half expected,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the blow seemed non\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e the less for its anticipation. Yet Alvin refused to admit the failure of all his plans--half-formed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 though they were--and only part of his brain was listening
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to Seranis now. He understood and noted all her words, but
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the conscious portion of his mind wa\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 s retracing the road to

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in his way.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Seranis was clearly unhappy. Her voice was almost pleading
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 as it spoke, and Alvin knew that she was talking not only
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to him but to her own son. Theon was wat\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ching his mother
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 with a concern which held at last more than a trace of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 accusation.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We have no desire to keep you here in Lys against your

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 great as any that ever separated Earth from its ancient
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 colonies. Think of this one fact, Alvin. You and Theon are

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 dead for centuries when you are stiJJ a boy."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The room was very quiet, so quiet that Alvin could hear
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the strange, plaintive cries of unknown beasts in the Selds
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 beyond the village. Presently he said, almost in a whisper:

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I have put your case to the Council, as I promised\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 , but

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "And Rorden? He would still know the truth, even if I

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 In that dark moment, it seemed to Alvin that the whole wor\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ld had turned against him. Though there was much truth
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in the words of Seranis, he would not recognize it he saw
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 only the wreck of his still dimly-conceived plans, the end
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the search for knowledge that had now become the most
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 important thing in his life.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Seranis must have read his thoughts.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I'll leave you for a while," she said. "But remember--
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 whatever your choice, there can be no turning back."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Theon followed her to the door but Alvin called after
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 him. He looked enquiringly at his mother, who hesitate\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 d
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for a moment and then nodded her head. The door closed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 silently behind her and Alvin knew that it would not open
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 again without her consent.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin waited until his racing thoughts were once more
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 under control.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Theon," he began, "you'll help me, won't you?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The other nodded but did not speak.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Then tell me this--how could your people stop me if
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 I tried to run away?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "That would be easy. If you tried to escape, my mother
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 would take control of your mind. Later, wh\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 en you became
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 one of us, you would not wish to leave."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I see. Can you tell if she is watching my mind now?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Theon looked worried, but his protest answered the question.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I shouldn't tell you that!"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "But you will, won't you?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The two bOys looked silently \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 at each other for many
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seconds. Then Theon smiled.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "You can't bully me, you know. Whatever you're planning
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 --and / can't read your mind--as soon as you tried to put

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I know that," said Alvin, "but is she looking into my
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mind at this moment?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The other hesitated.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "No, she isn't," he said at last. "I think's she's delib-

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 you."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 That was all he needed to know. For the first time Alvin
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 dared to turn his mind upon the only plan that offered any
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hope. He was far too stubborn to accept either of the alternatives
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Seranis had offered him, and even if there had been nothing at stake he would have bitterly resisted any attempt
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to override his will.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 In a little while Seranis would return. He could do noth'ing
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 until they were in the open again, and even then Seranis
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 wou\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ld be able to control his actions if he attempted to run
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 away. And apart from that, he was sure that many of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 villagers could intercept him long before he reached safety.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Very carefully, checking every detail, he traced out the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 only road that could lead\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  him back to Diaspar on the terms
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he wished.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Theon warned him when Seranis was near, and he quickly
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 turned his thoughts into harmless channels. It had never
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 been easy for her to understand his mind, and now it seemed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to Seranis as if she were far out in sp\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ace, looking down upon
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a world veiled with impenetrable clouds. Sometimes there
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 would be a rift in the covering, and for an instant she could
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 catch a glimpse of what lay beneath. She wondered what
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin was trying to hide from her. For a moment she dipped
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 into her son's mind, but Theon knew nothing of the other's
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 plans. She thought again of the precautions she had taken:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 as a man may flex his muscles before some great exertion,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 she ran through the compulsion patterns she might have to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 use. But there was no \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 trace of her preoccupation as she
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 smiled at Alvin from the doorway.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Well," she asked, "have you made up your mind?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin's reply seemed frank enough.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Yes," he said. "I will return to Diaspar."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I'm sorry, and I know that Theon will miss you. But
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 perhaps ifs best: this is not your world and you must think
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of your own people."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 With a gesture of supreme confidence, she stood aside
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to let Alvin pass through the door.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "The men who can obliterate your memory of Lys are
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 waiting for you: we expected this \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 decision."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin was glad to see that Seranis was leading him in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the direction he wished to go. She did not look back to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 see if he was following: her every movement told him:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Try and run away if you like--my mind is more powerful
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 than yours." And he knew \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that it was perfectly true.
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 85
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 They were clear of the houses when he stopped and turned
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to his friend.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Good-bye, Theon," he said, holding out his hands.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Thank you for all you've done. One day I'll be back."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Seranis had stopped \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and was watching him intently. He
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 smiled at her even while he measured the twenty feet of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ground between them.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I know that you're doing this against your will," he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 said, "and I don't blame you for it. I don't like what I'm
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 doing, either." (That was not tr\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ue, he thought. Already he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was beginning to enjoy himself.) He glanced quickly around:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 no one was approaching and Seranis had not moved. She
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was still watching him, probably trying to probe into his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mind. He talked quickly to prevent even the outlines of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his plan from shaping among his thoughts.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I do not believe you are right," he said, so unconscious
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of his intellectual arrogance that Seranis could not resist
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a smile. "It's wrong for Lys and Diaspar to remain apart
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 forever: one day they may need each oth\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 er desperately. So

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He waited no longer, and it was just as well. Seranis
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 never moved, but instantiv he felt his body slipping from
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his control. The power that had brus\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hed aside his own
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 will was even greater than he had expected, and he realized
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that many hidden minds must be aiding Seranis. Helplessly
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he began to walk back towards the center of the village,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and for an awful moment he thought his plans had failed.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Then t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 here came a flash of steel and crystal, and the metal
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 arms closed swiftly around him. His body fought against
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 them, as he had known it must do, but his struggles were
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 useless. The ground fell away beneath him and he caught
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a glimpse of Theon, frozen by sur\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 prise with a foolish smile
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 upon his face.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The robot was carrying him a dozen feet above the ground,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 much faster than a man could run. It took Seranis only a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 moment to understand his ruse, and his struggles died away
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 as she relaxed her control. But she was \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 not defeated yet,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and presently there happe-.ied that which Alvin had feared
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and done his best to counteract.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There were now two separate entities fighting inside his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mind, and one of them was pleading with the robot, begging
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 i\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 t to set him down again. The real Alvin waited, breathlessly,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 resisting only a little against forces he knew he could not
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hope to fight. He had gambled: there was no way of telling
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 86 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 beforehand if the machine could understand or\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ders as complex
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 as those he had given it. Under no circumstances, he had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 told the robot, must it obey any further commands of his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 until he was safely inside Diaspar. Those were the orders.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 If they were obeyed, Alvin had placed his fate beyond the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 reach of \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 human interferences.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Never hesitating, the machine raced on along the path
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he had so carefully mapped out for it. A part of him was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 still pleading angrily to be released, but he knew now that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he was safe. And presently Seranis understood that too, for
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 forces inside his brain ceased to war with one another.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Once more he was at peace, as ages ago an earlier wanderer
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had been when, lashed to the mast of his ship, he had heard
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the song of the Sirens die away across the wine-dark sea.
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "SO YOU SEE," CONCLUDE\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 D ALVIN, "IT WILL CARRY OUT ANY
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 orders I give, no matter how complicated they are. But as
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 soon as I ask questions about its origin, it simply freezes
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 like that."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The machine was hanging motionless above the Master
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Associator, its crystal lenses glittering \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in the silver light like
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a cluster of jewels. Of all the robots which Rorden had ever
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 met, this was by far the most baffling: he was now almost
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sure that it had been built by no human civilization. With
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 -such eternal servants it was not surprising that the Master's
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 personality had survived the ages.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin's return had raised so many problems that Rorden
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was almost afraid to think of them. He himself had not
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 found it easy to accept the existence of Lys wit\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 h all its
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 implications, and he wondered how Diaspar would react to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the new knowledge. Probably the city's immense inertia
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 would cushion the shock: it might well be years before all
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of its inhabitants fully appreciated the fact that they were
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 no longer alon\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e on Earth.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 But if Alvin had his way, things would move much more
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 quickly than that. There were times when Rorden regretted
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the failure of Seranis' plans\hich\f39 \emdash \loch\f39 everything would have been
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 so much simpler. The problem was immense, and for the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 second occasion in hi\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 s life Rorden could not decide what
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 course of action was correct. He wondered how many more
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 times Alvin would present him with such dilemmas, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 smiled a little wryly at the thought. For it would make no
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 difference either way: Alvin would do exactly as he\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  pleased.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 As yet, not more than a dozen people outside Alvin's own
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 family knew the truth. His parents, with whom he now had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 so little in common and often did not see for weeks, still
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 89
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 90 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seemed to think that he had merely been \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to some outlying
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 part of the city. Jeserac had been the only person to react
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 strongly: once the initial shock had worn off he had engaged
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in a violent quarrel with Rorden and the two were no longer
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 on speaking terms. Alvin, who had seen this coming for some
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 time, could guess the details but to his disappointment neither
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the protagonists would talk about the matter.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Later, there would be time enough to see that Diaspar
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 realized the truth: for the m\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 oment Alvin was too interested
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in the robot to worry about much else. He felt, and his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 belief was now shared by Rorden, that the tale he had heard
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in Shalmirane was only a fragment of some far greater story.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 At first Rorden had been skeptical, and he still\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  believed the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Great Ones" to be no more than another of the world's
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 countless religious myths. Only the robot knew the truth,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and it had defied a million centuries of questioning as it was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 defying them now.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "The trouble is," said Rorden, "that there are n\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 o longer
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 any engineers left in the world."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin looked puzzled: although contact with the Keeper
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the Records had greatly enlarged his vocabulary, there
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were thousands of archaic words he did not understand.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "An engineer," explained Rorden, "was a man w\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ho designed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and built machines. It's impossible for us to imagine
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 an age without robots--but every machine in the world had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to be invented at one time or other, and until the Master
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Robots were built they needed men to look after them. Once
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the machines co\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 uld care for themselves, human engineers
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were no longer required. I think that's a fairly accurate account,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 though of course it's mostly guesswork. Every machine
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 we possess existed at the beginning of our history, and many
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had disappeared long before it st\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 arted."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Such as flyers and spaceships," interjected Alvin.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Yes," agreed Rorden, "as well as the great communicators
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that could reach the stars. All these things vanished when
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 they were no longer needed."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin shook his head.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I still believe," he said, "that the disappearance of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 spaceships can't be explained as easily as that. But to get
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 back to the machine--do you think that the Master Robots
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 could help us? I've never seen one, of course, and don't
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 know much about them."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Help us? In what way?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I'm not quite sure," said Alvin vaguely. "Perhaps they
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 91
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 could force it to obey all my orders. They repair robots, don't
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 they? I suppose that would be a kind of repair . . ."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 His voice faded away as if h\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e had failed even to convince
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 himself.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden smiled: the idea was too ingenuous for him to put
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 much faith in it. However, this piece of historical research
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was the first of all Alvin's schemes for which he himself could
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 share much enthusiasm, and he could\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  think of no better plan
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 at the moment.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He walked towards the Associator, above which the robot
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was still floating as if in studied indifference. As he began,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 almost automatically, to set up his questions on the great
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 keyboard, he was suddenly struck by a \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 thought so incongruous
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that he burst out laughing.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin looked at his friend in surprise as Rorden turned
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 towards him.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Alvin," he said between chuckles, "I'm afraid we still
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 have a lot to learn about machines." He laid his hand on
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the robot's smooth metal body. "They don't share many
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 human feelings, you know. It wasn't really necessary for us
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to do all our plotting in whispers."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 THIS WORLD, ALVIN KNEW, HAD NOT BEEN MADE FOR MAN.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Under the glare of the trichromatic lights--so dazzlin\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 g that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 they pained the eyes--the long, broad corridors seemed to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 stretch to infinity. Down these great passageways all the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 robots of Diaspar must come at the end of their patient
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 lives, yet not once in a million years had they echoed to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the sound of human \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 feet.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It had not been difficult to locate the maps of the underground
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 city, the city of machines without whfirfi Diaspar
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 could not exist. A few hundred yards ahead the corridor
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 would open into a circular chamber more than a mile across,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 its roof supported \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 by great columns that must also bear the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 unimaginable weight of Power Center. Here, if the maps
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 spoke the truth, the Master Robots, greatest of all machines,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 kept watch over Diaspar.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The chamber was there, and it was even vaster than
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin had imagined--bu\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 t where were the machines? He
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 paused in wonder at the tremendous but meaningless panorama
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 beneath him. The corridor ended high in the wall of
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 92 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the chamber--surely the largest cavity ever built by man--
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and on either side long r\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 amps swept down to the distant
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 floor. Covering the whole of that brilliantly lit expanse were
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hundreds of great white structures, so unexpected that for
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a moment Alvin thought he must be looking down upon a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 subterranean city. The impression was startlingly vivid and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 i. was one he never wholly lost. Nowhere at all was the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sifht he had expected--the familiar gleam of metal which
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 since the beginning of time man had learned to associate
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 with his servants
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Here wa'\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  the end of an evolution almost as long as Man's.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Its beginning was lost in the mists of the Dawn Ages, when
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 humanity had first learned the use of power and sent its
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 nn'-y engines clanking about the world. Steam, water, wind
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 --all hac" been harnessed for a\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  little while and then abandoned.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 For centuries the energy of matter had run the world until
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it too had been superseded, and with each change the old
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 machines were forgotten and the new ones took their place.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Very slowly, over millions of years, the ideal \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the perfect
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 machine was approached--that ideal which had once been
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a dream, then a distant prospect, and at last reality:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 No machine may contain any moving parts.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Here was the ultimate expression of that ideal. Its achievement
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had taken Man perhaps a th\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ousand million years, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in the hour of his triumph he had turned his back upon the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 machine forever.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The robot they were seeking was not as large as many
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of its companions, but Alvin and Rorden felt dwarfed when
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 they stood beneath it. The five tiers with \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 their sweeping
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 horizontal lines gave the impression of some crouching beast,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and looking from it to his own robot Alvin thought it
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 strange that the same word should be used for both.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Almost three feet from the ground a wide transparent
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 panel ran the whole length of the structure. Alvin pressed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his forehead against the smooth, curiously warm material
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and peered into the machine. At first he saw nothing: then,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 by shielding his eyes, he could distinguish thousands of faint
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 points of light h\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 anging in nothingness. They were ranged
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 cne beyond the other in a three-dimensional lattice, as strange and as meaningless to him as the stars must have
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 been to ancient man.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden had joined him and together they stared into the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 brooding monster. Though t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hey watched for many minutes,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the colored lights never moved from their places and their
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 93
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 brilliance never changed. Presently Alvin broke away from
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the machine and turned to his friend.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "What are they?" he asked in perplexity.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "If we could look into our own minds," said Rorden,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "they would mean as little to us. The robots seem motionless
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 because we cannot see their thoughts."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 For the first time Alvin looked at the long avenue of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 titans with some trace of understanding. All his l\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ife he had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 accepted without question the miracle of the Synthesizers,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the machines which age after age produced in an unending
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 stream all that the city needed. Thousands of times he had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 watched that act of creation, never thinking that somewhere
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 must exist\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  the prototype of that which he had seen come
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 into the world.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 As a human mind may dwell for a little while upon a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 single thought, so these greater brains could grasp and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hold forever the most intricate ideas. The patterns of all
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 created things were frozen in these eternal minds, needing
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 only the touch of a human will to make them reality.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The world had gone very far since, hour upon hour, the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 first cavemen had patiently chipped their arrowlieads and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 knives from the stubborn stone.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Our problem now," said Rorden, "is to get into touch
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 with the creature. It can never have any direct knowledge
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of man, for there's no way in which we can affect its consciousness.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 If my information's correct, there must be an
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 interpreting machine somewhe\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 re. That was a type of robot
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that could convert human instructions into commands that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the Master Robots could understand. They were pure intelligence
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 with little memory--just as this is a tremendous
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 memory with relatively little intelligence."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin consid\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ered for a moment. Then he pointed to his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 own robot.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Why not use it?" he suggested. "Robots have very literal
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 minds. It won't refuse to pass on our instructions, for I doubt
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 if the Master ever thought of this situation."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden laughed.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I don't suppose h\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e did, but as there's a machine specially
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 built for the job I think it would be best to use it."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The Interpreter was a very small affair, a horseshoe shaped
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 construction built round a vision screen which lit up as
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 they approached. Of all the machines in th\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 is great cavern,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it was the only one which had shown any cognizance of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 man, and its greeting seemed a little contemptuous. For on
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the screen appeared the words:
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 FR1;94\tab AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 PLEASE THINK CLEARLY
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Ignoring the implied insult, Alvin began his st-orv. Though
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he had communicated with robots by speech or thought on
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 countless occasions, he felt now that he was addressing something
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 more than a machine. Lifeless though this creature
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was, it possessed an in\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 telligence that might be greater than
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his own. It was a strange thought, but it did not depress
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 him undulv--for of what use was intelligence alone?
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 His words died away and the silence of that overpowering
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 place crowded back upon them. For a moment the scre\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 en
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was filled with swirling mist: then the haze cleared and the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 machine replied:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 KEPAIR IMPOSSIBLE
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ROBOT UNKNOWN TYPE
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin turned to his friend with a gesture of disappointment,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 but even as he did so the lettering changed and a second
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 message appeared:

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Simultaneously a red light began to flash above a horizontal
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 panel Alvin had not noticed before, and was certain
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he must have seen had it been there earlier. Puzzled, he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 bent towards it, but a shout from Rorden mad\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e him look
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 round in surprise. The other was pointing towards the great
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Master Robot, where Alvin had left his own machine a few
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 minutes before.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It had not moved, but it had multiplied. Hanging in the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 air beside it was a duplicate so exact that Alvin could not
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 tell which was the original and which the copy.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I was watching when it happened," said Rorden excitedly.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "It suddenly seemed to extend, as if millions of replicas had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 come into existence on eithe\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 r side of it. Then all the images
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 except these two disappeared. The one on the right is the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 original."

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 what must have happened. His robot could not be forced
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to disobey the orders given it so long ag\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 o, but a duplicate
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 could be made with all its knowledge yet with the unbreakable
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 memory-block removed. Beautiful though the solution
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was, the mind would be unwise to dwell too long upon
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the powers that made it possible.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The robots moved as one when Alvin c\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 alled them towards
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 him. Speaking his commands, as he often did for Rorden's
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 benefit, he asked again the question he had put so many
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 times in different forms.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Can you tell me how your first master reached Shalmirane?"
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden wished his mind could intercep\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 t the soundless
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 replies, of which he had never been able to catch even a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 fragment. But this time there was little need, for the glad
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 smile that spread across Alvin's face was sufficient answer.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The boy looked at him triumphantly.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Number One is just the same," he said, "but Two is
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 willing to talk."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I think we should wait until we're home again before
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 we begin to ask questions," said Rorden, practical as ever.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We'll need the Associators and Recorders when we start."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Impatient thou\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 gh he was, Alvin had to admit the wisdom
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the advice. As he turned to go, Rorden smiled at his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 eagerness and said quietly:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Haven't you forgotten something?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The red light on the Interpreter was still flashing, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 its message still glowed on the screen.

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin walked to the machine and examined the panel
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 above which the light was blinking. Set in it was a window
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of some almost invisible substance, supporting a stylus which
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 passed vertically through it\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 . The point of tlie stylus rested
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 on a sheet of white material which already bore several
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 signatures and dates. The last of them was almost fifty
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 thousand years ago, and Alvin recognized the name as that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of a recent President of the Council. Above it only \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 two
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 other names were visible, neither of which meant anything
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to him or to Rorden. Nor was this very surprising, for they
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had been written twenty-three and fifty-seven million years
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 before.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin could see no purpose for this ritual, but he knew
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that he co\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 uld never fathom the workings of the minds that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had built this place. With a slight feeling of unreality he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 grasped the stylus and began to write his name. The instrument
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seemed completely free to move in the horizontal
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 plane, for in that direction the window offered no more
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 resistance than the wall of a sap-bubble. Yet his full strength
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was incapable of moving it vertically: he knew, because he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 tried.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Carefully he wrote the date and released the stylus. It
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 moved slowly b\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ack across the sheet to its original position
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 --and the panel with its winking light was gone.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 As Alvin walked awav, he wondered why his predecessors
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had come here and what they had sought from the machine.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 No doubt, thousands or millions of years in the f\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 uture, other
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 men would look into that panel and ask themselves: "Who
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was Alvin of Loronei?" Or would they? Perhaps they would
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 exclaim instead: "Look! Here's Alvin's signature!"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The thought was not untypical of him in his present
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mood, but he knew better th\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 an to share it with his friend.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 At the entrance to the corridor they looked back across
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the cave, and the illusion was stronger than ever. Lying
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 beneath them was a dead city of strange white buildings,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a city bleached by the fierce light not meant for huma\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 n
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 eyes. Dead it might be, for it had never lived, but Alvin
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 knew that when Diaspar had passed away these machines
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 would still be here, never turning their minds from the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 thoughts greater men than he had given them long ago.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 They spoke little on the way bac\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 k through the streets

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and wan after the glare of the machine city. Each in his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 own way was thinking of the knowledge that would soon
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 be his, and neither had any regard for the beauty of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 great towers drifting past, or the curious glances of their
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 fellow citizens.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was strange, thought Alvin, how everything that had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 happened to him led up to this moment. He knew well
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 enough that men\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  were makers of their own destinies, yet
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 since he had met Rorden events seemed to have moved
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 automatically towards a predetermined goal. Alaine's message--Lys--Shalmirane--at
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 every stage he might have turned
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 aside with unseeing eyes, but something had led \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 him on
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was pleasant to pretend that Fate had favoured him, but
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his rational mind knew better. Any man might have found
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the path his footsteps had traced, and countless times in the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 past ages others must have gone almost as far. He was simply
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the first t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 o be lucky.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The first to be luclcy. The words echoed mockingly in his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ears as they stepped through the door of Rorden's chamber.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Quietly waiting for them, with hands folded patiently across
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his lap, was a man wearing a curious garb unlike any that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin ha\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 d ever seen before. He glanced enquiringly at Rorden,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and was instantly shocked by the pallor of his friend's face.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Then he knew who the visitor was.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He rose as they entered and made a stiff, formal bow.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Without a word he handed a small cylinder to Rorden,\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  who
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 took it woodenly and broke the seal. The almost unheard-of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 rarity of a written message made the silent exchange doubly
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 impressive. When he had finished Rorden returned the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 cylinder with another slight bow at which, in spite of his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 anxiety, Alvin could not resist a smile.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden appeared to have recovered himself quickly, for
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 when he spoke his voice was perfectly normal.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "It seems that the Council would like a word with us,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin. I'm afraid we've kept it waiting."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin had guessed \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 as much. The crisis had come sooner
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 --much sooner--than he had expected. He was not, he told
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 himself, afraid of the Council, but the interruption was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 maddening. His eyes strayed involuntarily to the robots.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "You'll have to leave them behind," said Rorden f\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 irmly.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Their eyes met and clashed. Then Alvin glanced at the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Messenger.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Very well," he said quietly.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The party was very silent on its way to the Council
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Chamber. Alvin was marshalling the arguments he had never
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 100 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 properly thou\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ght out, believing they would not be needed for
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 many years. He was far more annoyed than alarmed, and he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 felt angry at himself for being so unprepared.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 They waited only a few minutes in the anteroom, but it
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was long enough for, Alvin to wonder why, if he w\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 as unafraid, his legs felt so curiously weak. Then the great doors contracted,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and they walked towards the twenty men gathered
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 round their famous table.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 This, Alvin knew, was the first Council Meeting in his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 lifetime, and he felt a little flattered as he n\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 oticed that there
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were no empty seats. He had never known that Jeserac was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a Council member. At his startled gaze the old man shifted
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 uneasily in his chair and gave him a furtive smile as if to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 say: "This is nothing to do with me." Most of the other
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 faces Alvin had expected, and only two were quite unknown
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to him.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The President began to address them in a friendly voice, and looking at the familiar faces before him, Alvin could
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 see no great cause for Rorden's alarm. His confidence began
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to return: Rord\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 en, he decided, was something of a coward.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 In that he did his friend less than justice, for although courage
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had never been one of Rorden's most conspicuous qualities,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his worry concerned his ancient office almost as much as
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 himself. Never in history had a\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  Keeper of the Records been
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 relieved of his position: Rorden was very anxious not to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 create a precedent.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 In the few minutes since he had entered the Council
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Chamber, Alvin's plans had undergone a remarkable change.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The speech he had so carefully rehearsed \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was forgotten: the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Ene phrases he had been practising were reluctantly discarded.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 To his support now had come his most treacherous ally--
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that sense of the ridiculous which had always made it impossible
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for him to take very seriously even the most solemn
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 o\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ccasions. The Council might meet once in a thousand years:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it might control the destinies of Diaspar--but those who sat
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 upon it were only tired old men. Alvin knew Jeserac, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he did not believe that the others would be very different.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He felt a disconcer\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ting pity for them, and suddenly remembered
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the words Seranis had spoken to him in Lys: "Ages
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ago we sacrificed our immortality, but Diaspar still follows
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the false dream." That in truth these men had done, and he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 did not believe it had brought them happiness.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 So when at.the President's invitation Alvin began to describe
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his journey to Lys, he was to all appearances no more
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 than a boy who had by chance stumbled on a discovery
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 101
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he though\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 t of little importance. There was no hint of any
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 plan or deeper purpose: only natural curiosity had led him
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 out of Diaspar. It might have happened to anyone, yet he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 contrived to give the impression that he expected a little
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 praise for his cleverness. Of Sh\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 almirane and the robots, he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 said nothing at all.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was quite a good performance, though Alvin was the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 only person who could fully appreciate it. The Council as a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 whole seemed favourably impressed, but Jeserac wore an
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 expression in which relief struggled w\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ith incredulity. At
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden, Alvin dared not look.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 When he had quite finished, there was a brief silence while
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the Council considered his statement. Then the President
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 spoke again:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We fully appreciate," he said, choosing his words with
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 obvious care, "that \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 you had the best of motives in what you
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 did. However, you have created a somewhat difficult situation
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for us. Are you quite sure that your discovery was accidental,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and that no one, shall we say, Influenced you in any way?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 His eyes wandered thoughtfully t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 owards Rorden.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 For the last time, Alvin yielded to the mischievous prompt-
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ings of his mind.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I wouldn't say that," he replied, after an appearance of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 considerable thought. There was a sudden quickening of interest
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 among the Council Members, and Rorden stirred uneasily
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 by his side. Alvin gave his audience a smile that lacked
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 nothing of candor, and added quickly in a guileless voice:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I'm sure I owe a great deal to my tutor."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 At this unexpected and singularly misleadi\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ng compliment,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 all eyes were turned upon Jeserac, who became a deep red,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 started to speak, and then thought better of it. There was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 an awkward silence until the President stepped into the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 breach.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Thank you," he said hastily. "You will remain here while
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 we\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  consider your statement."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There was an audible sigh of relief from Rorden--and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that was the last sound Alvin heard for some time. A blanket
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of silence had descended upon him, and although he could
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 see the Council arguing heatedly, not a word of its delibe\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 rations
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 reached him. It was amusing at first, but the spectacle
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 soon became tedious and he was glad when the silence lifted
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 again.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We have come to the conclusion," said the President,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "that there has been an unfortunate mishap for which no
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 one can be held\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  responsible--although we consider that the
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 102 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Keeper of the Records should have informed us sooner of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 what was happening. However, it is perhaps as well that this
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 dangerous discovery has been made, for we can now take
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 suitable steps to prevent its recurrence. We will deal ourselves
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 with the transport system you have located, and you" --turning to Rorden for the first time--"will ensure that all
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 references to Lys are removed from the Records."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There was a murmur of appla\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 use and expressions of satisfaction
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 spread across the faces of the Councillors. 'A difficult
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 situation had been speedily dealt with, they had avoided the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 unpleasant necessity of reprimanding Rorden, and now they
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 could go their ways again feeling that they,\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  the chief citizens
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of Diaspar, had done their duty. With reasonably good
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 fortune it might be centuries before the need arose again.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Even Rorden, disappointed though he was for Alvin's sake
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 as well a? his own, felt relieved at the outcome. Things might
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hav\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e been very much worse--
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 A voice he had never heard before cut into his reverie and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 froze the Councillors in their seats, the complacent smiles
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 slowly ebbing from their faces.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "And precisely why are you going to close the way to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Lys?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was some time befo\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 re Rorden's mind, unwilling to recognize
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 disaster, would admit that it was Alvin who spoke.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The success of his subterfuge had given Alvin only a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 moment's satisfaction. Throughout the President's address his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 anger- had been steadily rising as he realized th\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 at, despite all
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his cleverness, his plans were to be thwarted. The feelings
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he had known in Lys when Seranis had presented her ultimatum
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 came back with redoubled strength. He had won that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 contest, and the taste of power was still sweet.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 This time he had no\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  robot to help him, and he did not
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 know what the outcome would be. But he no longer had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 any fear of these foolish old men who thought themselves
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the rulers of Diaspar. He had seen the real rulers of the city,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and had spoken to them in the grav\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e silence of their brilliant, buried world. So in his anger and arrogance, Alvin threw
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 away his disguise and the Councillors looked in vain for the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 artless boy who had addressed them a little while ago.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Why are you going to close the way to Lys?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There wa\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 s a long silence in the Council Room, but the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 lips of Jeserac twisted into a slow, secret smile. Tins Alvin
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was new to him, but it was less alien than the one who had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 spoken before.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The President chose at first to ignore the challenge. Per\page AGAINST THE FALL\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  OF NIGHT 103
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 haps he could not bring himself to believe that it was more
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 than an innocent question, however violently it had been
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 expressed.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "That is a matter of high policy which we cannot discuss
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 here," he said pompously, "but Diaspar cannot risk contam\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ination
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 with other cultures." He gave Alvin a benevolent but
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 slightly worried smile.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "It's rather strange," said Alvin coldly, "that in Lys I was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 told exactly the same thing about Diaspar." He was glad to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 see the start of annoyance, but gave his audience n\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 o time to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 reply.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Lys," he continued, "is much larger than Diaspar and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 its culture is certainly not inferior. It's always known about
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 us but has chosen not to reveal itself--as you put it, to avoid
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 contamination. Isn't it obvious that we are both wrong?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 H\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e looked expectantly along the lines of faces, but nowhere
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was there any understanding of his words. Suddenly his anger
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 agayist these leaden-eyed old men rose to a crescendo. The
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 blood was throbbing in his cheeks, and though his voice was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 steadier now it held a note of icy contempt which even the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 most pacific of the Councillors could no longer overlook.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Our ancestors," began Alvin, "built an empire which
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 reached to the stars. Men came and went at will among
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 all those worlds--and now their \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 descendants are afraid to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 stir beyond the walls of their city. ShaJi I tell you why?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He paused: there was no movement at all in the great, bare
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 room.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "It is because we are afraid--afraid of something that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 happened at the beginning of history. I was told t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he truth
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in Lys, though I had guessed it long ago. Must we always
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hide like cowards in Diaspar, pretending that nothing else
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 exists--because half a billion years ago the Invaders drove
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 us back to Earth?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He had put his finger on their secret fear, the fear\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  that he had never shared and whose power he could therefore
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 never understand. Let them do what they pleased: he had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 spoken the truth.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 His anger drained away and he was himself again, as yet
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 only a little alarmed at what he had done. He turned to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the Presi\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 dent in a last gesture of independence.

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the head gave him his release. The great doors expanded

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The President waited until the inevitable lull. Then he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 turned to Jeserac.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "It seems to me," he said, "that we should hear your
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 views Erst."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Jeserac examined the remark for possible traps. Then he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 replied:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I think-that Diaspar is now losing its most outstanding
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 brain."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "What do you mean?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Isn't it obvious? By now young Alvin will be halfway
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to the Tomb of Yarlan Zey. No, we shouldn't interfer\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e. I shall
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 be very sorry to lose him, though he never cared very much
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for me." He sighed a little. "For that matter, he never cared
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a great deal for anyone save Alvin of Loronei."
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 NOT UNTIL AN HOUR LATER WAS RORDEN ABLE TO ESCAPE
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 from the Council Chamber.\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  The delay was maddening, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 when he reached his rooms he knew it was too late. He
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 paused at the entrance, wondering if Alvin had left any
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 message, and realizing for the Erst time how empty the years
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ahead would be.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The message was there, but its contents\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  were totally unexpected.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Even when Rorden had read it several times, he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was still completely baffled:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Meet me at once in the Tower of Loranne."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Only once before had he been to the Tower of Loranne, when Alvin had dragged him there to watch the sunset. Th\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 at
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was years ago: the experience had been unforgettable but
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the shadow of night sweeping across the desert had terrified
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 him so much that he had fled, pursued by Alvin's entreaties.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He had sworn that he would never go there again. . . .
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Yet here he was, in that bleak chamber pierced with the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 horizontal ventilating shafts. There was no sign of Alvin,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 but when he called, the boy's voice answered at once.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I'm on the parapet--come through the centre shaft."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden hesitated: there were many \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 things he would much
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 rather do. But a moment later he was standing beside Alvin
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 with his back to the city and the desert stretching endlessly
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 before him.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 They looked at each other in silence for a little while. Then
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin said, rather contritely:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I hope I\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  didn't get you into trouble."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden was touched, and many truths he was about to utter died abruptly on his lips. Instead he replied:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "The Council was too busy arguing with itself to bother
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 107
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 108 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 about me." He chuckled. "Jese\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 rac was putting up quite a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 spirited defense when I left. I'm afraid I misjudged him."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I'm sorry about Jeserac."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Perhaps it was an unkind trick to play on the old man,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 but I think he's rather enjoying himself. After all, there was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 some truth in your remar\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 k. He was the first man to show
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 you the ancient world, and he has rather a guilty conscience."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 For the first time, Alvin smiled.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "It's strange," he said, "but until I lost my temper I never really understood what I wanted to do. Whether they like
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it or not\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 , I'm going to break down the wall between Diaspar
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and Lys. But that can wait: it's no longer so important now."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden felt a little alarmed.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "What do you mean?" he asked anxiously. For the first
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 time he noticed that only one of the robots was with them
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 on the parapet. "Where's the second machine?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Slowly, Alvin raised his arm and pointed out across the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 desert, towards the broken hills and the long line of sand-
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 dunes, criss-crossed like frozen waves. Far away, Rorden could
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 see the unmistakable gleam of s\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 unlight upon metal.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We've been waiting for you," said Alvin quietly. "As
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 soon as I left the Council, I went straight to the robots.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Whatever happened, I was going to make sure that no
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 one took them away before I'd leamt all they could teach
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 me. It didn't \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 take long, for they're not very intelligent and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 knew less than I'd hoped. But I have found the secret of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Master." He paused for a moment, then pointed again at
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the almost invisible robot. "Watch!"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The glistening speck soared away from the desert and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ca\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 me to rest perhaps a thousand feet above the ground. At
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 first, not knowing what to expect, Rorden could see no
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 other change. Then, scarcely believing his eyes, he saw that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a cloud of dust was slowly rising from the desert.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Nothing is more terrible than mov\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ement where no movement
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 should ever be again, but Rorden was beyond surprise
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 cr fear when the great sand dunes began to slide apart.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Beneath the desert something was stirring like a giant awaking from its sleep, and presently there came to Rorden's ears
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 th\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e rumble of falling earth and the shriek of rock split asunder
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 by irresistible force. Then, suddenly, a great geyser of sand
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 erupted hundreds of feet into the air and the ground was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hidden from sight.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Slowly the dust began to settle back into the fagged
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 wound torn across the face of the desert. But Rorden and
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 109
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvi'n stiH kept their eyes fixed steadfastly upon the open
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sky, which a little while ago had held only the waiting robot
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 What Alvin was thinking, Rorden could scarcely\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  imagine
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 At last he knew what the boy had meant when he had said
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that nothing else was very important now. The great city
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 behind them and the greater desert before, the timidity of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the Council and the pride of Lys\hich\f39 \emdash \loch\f39 all these seemed trivial
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 matters now.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 covering of earth and rock could blur but could not
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 conceal the proud lines of the ship still ascending from the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 riven desert. As Rorden watched, it slowly turned towards
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 them until it had foreshortened to a circle. Then, very
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 leisurely, the circle started\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  to expand.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin began to speak, rather quickly, as if the time were
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 short.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I still do not know who the Master was, or why he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 came to Earth. The robot gives me the impression that he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 landed secretly and hid his ship where it could be easily
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 found if he e\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ver needed it again. In all the world there could
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 have been no better hiding place than the Port of Diaspar,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 which now lies beneath those sands and which even in his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 age must have been utterly deserted. He may have lived for
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a while in Diaspar before he we\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 nt to Shalmirane: the road
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 must still have been open in those days. But he never needed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the ship again, and all these ages it has been waiting out
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 there beneath the sands."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The ship was now very close, as the controlling robot
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 guided it t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 owards the parapet. Rorden could see that it
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was about a hundred feet long and sharply pointed at both
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ends. There appeared to be no windows or other openings,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 though the thick layer of earth made it impossible to be
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 certain.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Suddenly they were spattered w\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ith dirt as a section of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the hull opened outwards, and Rorden caught a glimpse of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a small, bare room with a second door at its far end. The ship
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was now hanging only a foot away from the parapet, which
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it had approached very cautiously like a sensitive, li\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ving thing.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden had backed away from it as if he were afraid, which
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 indeed was very near the truth. To him the ship symbolized
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 all the terror and mystery of the Universe, and evoked as
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 could no other object the racial fears which for so long had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 paralyz\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ed the will of the human race. Looking at his friend,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin knew very well the thoughts that were passing through
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his brain. For almost the first time he realized that there were
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 FR1;110 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 forces in men's minds over which they had \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 no control, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that the Council was deserving of pity rather than contempt.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 IN UTTER SILENCE, THE SHIP DREW AWAY FROM THE TOWER.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was strange, Rorden thought, that for the second time
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in his life he had said good-bye to Alvin. The little, closed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 world o\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 f Diaspar knew only one farewell, and that was for
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 eternity.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The ship was now only a dark stain against the sky, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of a sudden Rorden lost it altogether. He never saw its
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 going, but presently there echoed down from the heavens
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the most awe-inspiring of all the sounds that Man had ever
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 made--the long-drawn thunder of air falling, mile after mile,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 into a tunnel drilled suddenly across the sky.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Even when the last echoes had died away into the desert,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden never moved. He was thin\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 king of the boy who had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 gone--wondering, as he had so often done, if he would ever
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 understand that aloof and baffling mind. Alvin would never
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 grow up: to him the whole universe was a plaything, a puzzle
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to be unravelled for his own amusement In his play he\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 now found the ultimate, deadly toy which might wreck what
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was left of human civilization--but whatever the outcome, to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 him it would still be a game.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The sun was now low en the horizon, and a chill wind
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was blowing from the desert But still Rorden wait\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ed, conquering
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his fears, and presently for the first time in his life
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he saw the stars.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 EVEN IN DIASPAR, ALVIN HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH LUXURY AS
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that which lay before him when the inner door of the airlock
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 slid aside. At first he did not understand its implic\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ations:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 then he began to wonder, rather uneasily, how long this tiny
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 world might be upon its journeying between the stars. There
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were no controls of any kind, but the large, oval screen which
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 completely covered the tar wall would have shown that this
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was n\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 o ordinary room. Ranged in a half circle before it were
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 three low couches: the rest of the cabin was occupied by two
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 tables, a number of most inviting chairs, and many curious
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 devices which for the moment Alvin could not identify.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 When he had made himself comfortable in front of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 screen, he looked around for the robots. To his surprise, they
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT III
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had disappeared: then he located them, neatly stowed away
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in recesses high up beneath the curved ceiling Thei\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 r action
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had been so completely natural that Alvin knew at once the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 purpose for which they had been intended He remembered
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the Master Robots: these were the Interpreters, without which
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 no untrained human mind could control a machine as complex
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 as a spacesh\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ip. They had brought the Master to Earth and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 then, as his servants, followed him into Lys. Now they were
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ready, as if the intervening aeons had never been, to carry
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 out their old duties once again.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin threw them an experimental command, and the great
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sc\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 reen shivered into life. Before him was the Tower of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Loranne, curiously foreshortened and apparently lying on its
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 side. Further trials gave him views of the sky, of the city,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and of great expanses of desert. The definition was brilliantly,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 almost unnatural\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ly, clear, although there seemed to be no
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 actual magnification. Alvin wondered if the ship itself moved
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 as the picture changed, but could think of no way of discovering
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 this. He experimented for a little while until he could
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 obtain any view he wished: then\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  he was ready to start.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Take me to Lys"--the command was a simple one, but
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 how could the ship obey it when he himself had no idea
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the direction? Alvin had never thought of this, and when
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it did occur to him the machine was already moving across
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the desert at a tremendous speed. He shrugged his shoulders,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 thankfully accepting what he could not understand.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was difficult to judge the scale of the picture racing
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 up the screen, but many miles must be passing every minute
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Not far from the city the c\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 olor of the ground had changed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 abruptly to a dull grey, and Alvin knew that he was now
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 passing over the bed of one of the lost oceans. Once Diaspar
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 must have been very near the sea, though there had never
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 been any hint of this even in the most ancient reco\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 rds. Old
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 though the city was, the oceans must have passed away long
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 before its building.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Hundreds of miles later, the ground rose sharply and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the desert returned. Once Alvin halted his ship above a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 curious pattern of intersecting lines, showing faintly thr\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ough
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the blanket of sand. For a moment it puzzled him: then he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 realized that he was looking down on the ruins of some
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 forgotten city. He did not stay for long: it was heartbreaking
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to think that billions of men had left no other trace of their
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 existence sa\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ve these furrows in the sand.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The smooth curve of the horizon was breaking up at last,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 crinkling into mountains that were beneath him almost as
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 112 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 soon as they were glimpsed. The machine was slowing now,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 slowing and falling to e\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 arth in a great arc a hundred miles
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in length. And then below him was Lys, its forests and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 endless rivers forming a scene of such incomparable beauty
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that for a while he would go no farther. To the east, the land
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was shadowed and the great lakes floated upon it like pools
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of darker night. But towards the sunset, the waters danced
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and sparkled with light, throwing back towards him such
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 colors as he had never imagined.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was not difficult to locate Airlee--which was\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  fortunate, for the robots could guide him no farther. Alvin had expected
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 this, and felt glad to have discovered some limits to their powers. After a little experimenting, he brought his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ship to rest on the hillside which had given him his first
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 glimpse of\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  Lys. It was quite easy to control the machine:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he had only to indicate his genera] desires and the robots
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 attended to the details. They would, he imagined, probably
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ignore any dangerous or impossible orders, but he did not
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 intend to try the experiment.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Al\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 vin was fairly certain that no one could have seen
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his arrival. He thought this rather important, for he had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 no desire to engage in mental combat with Seranis again.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 His plans were still somewhat vague, but he was running no
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 risks until he had re-establish\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ed friendly relations.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The discovery that the original robot would no longer
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 obey him was a considerable shock. When he ordered it from
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 its little compartment it refused to move but lay motionless,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 watching him dispassionately with its multiple eyes. To Al\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 vin's
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 relief, the replica obeyed him instantly, but no amount of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 cajoling could make the prototype carry out even the simplest
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 action. Alvin worried for some time before the explanation
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the mutiny occurred to him. For all their wonderful skills,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the rob\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ots were not very intelligent, and the events of the past
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hour must have been too much for the unfortunate machine.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 One by one it had seen all the Master's orders defied--
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 those orders which it had obeyed with such singleness of purpose
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for so many millions of years.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was too late for regrets now, but Alvin was sorry he had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 made only a single duplicate. For the borrowed robot had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 become insane.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin met no one on the road to Airlee. It was strange
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to sit in the spaceship while his fiel\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 d of vision moved effortlessly
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 along the familiar path, and the whispering of the forest
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sounded in his ears. As yet he was unable to identify himself
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 113
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 fully with the robot, and the strain of controlling it was still
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 considera\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ble.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was nearly dark when he reached Airlee, and the little
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 houses were floating in pools of light. Alvin kept to the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 shadows and had almost reached Seranis' home before he was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 discovered. Suddenly there was an angry, high-pitched buzzing
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and his view w\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 as blocked by a flurry of wings. He recoiled
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 involuntarily before the onslaught: then he realized what
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had happened. Krif did not approve of anything that flew
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 without wings, and only Theon's presence had prevented him
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 from attacking the robot on earlier o\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ccasions. Not wishing
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to hurt the beautiful but stupid creature, Alvin brought the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 robot to a halt and endured as best he could the blows that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seemed to be raining upon him. Though he was sitting in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 comfort a mile away, he could not avoid flinching and was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 glad when Theon came out to investigate.
\par \page 
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AT HIS MASTER'S APPROACH KRIF DEPARTED, STILL BUZZING
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 balefully. In the silence that followed Theon stood looking
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 at the robot for a while. Then he smiled
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I'm glad you've come back. Or are you still in Diaspar?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Not for the first time Alvin felt a twinge of envy as he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 realized how much quicker Theon's mind was than his own
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "No," he said, wondering as he did so how clearly the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 robot echoed his voice. "I'm in\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  Airlee, not very far away.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 But I'm staying here for the present."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Theon laughed heartily.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I think that's just as well," he said. "Mother's forgiven
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 you, but the Centra] Council hasn't. There's a conference
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 going on indoors now: I have to keep out of the \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 way"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "What are they talking about?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I'm not supposed to know, but they asked me all sorts
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of questions about you. I had to tell them what happened
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in Shalmirane."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "That doesn't matter very much," replied Alvin "A good
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 many other things have happened since\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  then. I'd like to have
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a talk with this Central Council of yours."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Oh, the whole Council isn't here, naturally. But three of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 its members have been making enquiries ever since you left '
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin smiled. He could well believe it: wherever he went
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 now he seem\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ed to be leaving a trail of consternation behind
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 him.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The comfort and security of the spaceship gave him a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 confidence he had seldom known before, and he felt complete
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 master of the situation as he followed Theon into the house
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The door of the conference ro\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 om was locked and it was some
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 time before Theon could attract attention. Then the walls
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 slid reluctantly apart, and Alvin moved his robot swiftly
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 forward into the chamber.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 117
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 118 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The room was the familiar one in which he had had his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 last interview with Seranis Overhead the stars were twinkling
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 as if there were no ceiling or upper floor, and once again
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin wondered how the illusion was achieved. The three
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 councillors froze in thei\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 r seats as he floated towards them,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 but only the slightest flicker of surprise crossed Seranis' face.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Good evening," he said politely, as if this vicarious entry
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were the most natural thing in the world. "I've decided to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 come baci;."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Their surprise exceed\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ed his expectations. One of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 councillors, a young man with greying hair, was the first to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 recover.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "How did you get here?" he gasped.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin thought it wise to evade the question: the way in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 which it was asked made him suspicious and he wondered
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 if the u\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 nderground transport system had been put out of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 action.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Why, just as I did last time," he lied.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Two of the councillors looked fixedly at the third, who
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 spread his hands in a gesture of baffled resignation. Then the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 young man who had addressed him before s\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 poke again.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Didn't you have any--difficulty?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "None at all," said Alvin, determined to increase their
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 confusion. He saw that he had succeeded.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I've come back," he continued, "under my own free will,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 but in view of our previous disagreement I'm remaining out
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of sight for the moment. If I appear personally, will you
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 promise not to try and restrict my movements again?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 No one said anything for a while and Alvin wondered
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 what thoughts were being exchanged\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 . Then Seranis spoke for
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 them all.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I imagine that there is little purpose in doing so. Diaspar
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 must know all about us by now."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin flushed slightly at the reproach in her voice.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Yes, Diaspar knows," he replied. "And Diaspar will have
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 nothing to do with\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  you. It wishes to avoid contamination
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 with an inferior culture."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was most satisfying to watch the councillors' reactions,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and even Seranis colored slightly at his words. If he could
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 make Lys and Diaspar sufficiently annoyed with each other,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin reali\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 zed that his problem would be more than half
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 solved. He was learning, still unconsciously, the lost art of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 politics.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "But I don't want to stay out here all night," he continued.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Have I your promise?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Seranis smiled, and a faint smile played about her lips.
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 119
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Yes," she said, "we won't attempt to control you again.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Though I don't think we were very successful before."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin waited until the robot had returned. Very carefully
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he gave the machine its instructions and made it repea\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 t them
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 back. Then he left the ship and the airlock closed silently
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 behind him.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There was a faint whisper of air but no other sound. For
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a moment a dark shadow blotted out the stars: then the ship
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was gone. Not until it had vanished did Alvin realize his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 miscalculation. He had forgotten that the robot's senses were
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 very different from his own, and the night was far darker than
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he had expected. More than once he lost the path completely,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and several times he barely avoided colliding with
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 trees. It was black\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 est of all in the forest, and once something
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 quite large came towards him through the undergrowth
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There was the faintest crackling of twigs, and two emerald
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 eyes were looking steadfastly at him from the level of his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 waist. He called softly, and an incredib\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 le long tongue rasped
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 across his hand. A moment later a powerful body rubbed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 affectionately against him and departed without a sound. He
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had no idea what it could be.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Presently the lights of the village were shining through the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 trees ahead, but he no longe\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 r needed their guidance for the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 path beneath his feet had now become a river of dim blue
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 fire. The moss upon which he was walking was luminous and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his footprints left dark patches which slowly disappeared
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 behind him. It was a beautiful and entrancing sight\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 , and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 when Alvin stooped to pluck some of the strange moss it
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 glowed for minutes in his cupped hands before its radiance
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 died.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Theon was waiting for him outside the house, and for the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 second time he was introduced to the three councillors. He
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 noticed with some annoyance their barely concealed surprise:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 not appreciating the unfair advantages it gave him, he never
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 cared to be reminded of his youth.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 They said little while he refreshed himself, and Alvin
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 wondered what mental notes were being compar\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ed. He kept
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his mind as empty as he could until he had finished: then
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he began to talk as he had never talked before.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 His theme was Diaspar. He painted the city as he had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 last seen it, dreaming on the breast of the desert, its towers
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 glowing like captive r\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ainbows against the sky. From the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 treasure-house of memory he recalled the songs that the poets
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of old had written in praise of Diaspar, and he spoke of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 countless men who had burnt away their lives to increase its
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 beauty. No one now, he told them, coul\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 d ever exhaust a

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hundredth of the city's treasures, however long they lived.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 For a while he described some of the wonders which the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mm of Diaspar had wrought: he tried to mak& them catch
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ,1 glimpse ;it least of the loveliness\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  which such artists as
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Shcrvane and Ferildcr Had created for men's eternal admiration.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 And he spoke also of Loronci, whose name he bore,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and wondered a little wistfully if it were indeed true that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his music was the last sound Earth had ever broadcast to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 th\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e stars.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 They heard him to the end without interruption or questioning.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 When he had finished it was very late and Alvin felt
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 more tired than he could ever remember. The strain and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 excitement of the long day had told on him at last, and quite
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 suddenly he fell asleep.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin was still tired when they left the village not long
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 after dawn. Early though it was, they were not the first upon
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the road. By the lake they overtook the three councillors, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 both parties exchanged slightly self-conscious g\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 reetings. Alvin
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 knew perfectly well where the Committee of Investigation
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was going, and thought it would be appreciated if he saved
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it some trouble. He stopped when they reached the foot of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the hill and turned towards his companions.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I'm afraid I misled y\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ou last night," he said cheerfully.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I didn't come to Lys by the old route, so your attempt to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 close it wasn't really necessary."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The councillors' faces were a study in relief and increased
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 perplexity.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Then how did you get here?" The leader of the Committ\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ee
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 spoke, and Alvin could tell that he at least had begun
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to guess the truth. He wondered if he had intercepted the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 command his mind had just sent winging across the mountains.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 But he said nothing, and merely pointed in silence to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the northern sky.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Too swi\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ft for the eye to follow, a needle of silver light
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 arced across the mountains, leaving a mile-long trail of incandescence.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Twenty thousand feet above Lys, it stopped.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There was no deceleration, no slow braking of its colossal
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 speed. It came to a halt insta\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ntly, so that the eye that had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 been following it moved on across a quarter of the heavens
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 before the brain could arrest its motion. Down from the skies
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 crashed a mighty peal of thunder, the sound of air battered
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and smashed by the violence of the ship's passage. A little
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 later the ship itself, gleaming splendidly in the sunlight, came
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to rest upon the hillside a hundred yards away.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was difficult to say who was the most surprised, but
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin was the first to reco\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ver. As they walked--very nearly
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 121
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 running--towards the spaceship, he wondered if it normally
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 travelled in this abrupt fashion. The thought was disconcerting,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 although there had been no sensation of movement on
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his first voyage\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 . Considerably more puzzling, however, was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the fact that the day before this resplendent creature hnd
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 been hidden beneath a thick layer of iron-hard rock. Not
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 until Alvin had reached the ship. and burnt his fingers by
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 incautiously resting them on the hull,\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  did he understand
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 what had happened. Near the stern there were still traces of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 earth, but it had been fused into lava. All the rest had been
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 swept away, leaving uncovered the stubborn metal which
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 neither time nor any natural force could ever touch.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 With T\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 heon by his side, Alvin stood in the open door
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and looked back at the three silent councillors. He wondered
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 what they were thinking, but their expressions gave no hint
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of their thoughts.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I have a debt to pay in Shalmirane," he said. "Please tell
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Seranis w\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e'll be back by noon."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The councillors watched until the ship, now moving quite
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 slowly--for it had only a little way to go--had disappeared
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 into the south. Then the young man who led the group
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 shrugged his shoulders philosophically.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "You've always opposed us for wanting change," he said,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "and so far you've won. But I don't think the future lies with
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 either of our parties now. Lys and Din spar have both come
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to the end of an era, and we must make the best of it."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There was silence for \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a little while. Then one of his companions
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 spoke in a very thoughtful voice.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I know nothing of archeology, but surely that machine
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was too large to be an ordinary flyer. Do you think it could
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 possibly have been--"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "A spaceship? If so, this is a crisis!"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 T\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he third man had also been thinking deeply.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "The disappearance of both flyers and spaceships is one of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the greatest mysteries of the Interregnum. That machine may
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 be either: for the moment we had better assume the worst.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 If it is in fact a spaceship, we mu\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 st at all costs prevent that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 boy from leaving Earth. There is the danger that he may
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 attract the Invaders again. That would be the end."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 A gloomy silence settled over the company until the leader
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 spoke again.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "That machine came from Diaspar," he said slowl\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 y. "Someone
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 there must know the truth. I think we had better get
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in touch with our cousins--if they'll condescend to speak
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to us."

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Sooner than he had any right to expect, the seed that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvm had planted was beginning to So\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 wer.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 THE MOUNTAINS WERE STILL SWIMMING IN SHADOW WHEN

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the fortress looked very small: it seemed impossible that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the fate of Earth had once depended on that tiny ebon disc.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 When Alvin brought the ship to rest among the ruins,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the desolation crowded upon him, chilling his soul. There
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was no sign of the old man or his machines, and they had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 some difficulty in finding the entrance to the tunnel. At the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 top of the stairway Alvin \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 shouted to give warning of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 arrival: there was no reply and they moved quietly forward,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in case he was asleep.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Sleeping he was, his hands folded peacefully upon his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 breast. His eyes were open, staring sightlesdy up at the massive
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 roof, as if they could \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 see through to the stars beyond.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There was a slight smile upon his lips: Death had not come
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to him as an enemy.

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 tentacles re\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ached out to restrain him. so he came no nearer.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There was nothing he could do: as he stood in that silent
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 room he felt an icy wind sweep through his heart. It was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the first time he had looked upon the marble face of Death,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and he knew that something of hi\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 s childhood had passed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 forever.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 So this was the end of that strange brotherhood, perhaps

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 knowledge that else would have been lost forever. Now their

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 They left him sleeping in his tomb among the mountains,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 where no man would disturb him until the end of Time.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Guarding his body were the machines which had served him
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in life and which, A1vin knew, would never leave him now.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Locked to his mind, they would wait here for the commands
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that could never come, until \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the mountains themselves had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 crumbled away.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The little four-legged animal which had once served man

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 boys ever to have heard of it.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 They walked in silence back to the waiting ship, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 presently the f\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ortress was once more a dark lake among the

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 rose until the whole of Lys lay spread beneath them, a great
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 green island in an orange sea. Never before had A1vin been
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 so high: when finally they cam\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e to rest the whole crescent
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the Earth was visible below. Lys was very small now; only

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a many-\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 colored jewel. And thus for the first time Theon
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 saw the city of Diaspar.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 They sat for a long time watching the Earth turn beneath
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 them. Of all Man's ancient powers, this surely was the one
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he could least afford to lose. Alvin wished he could show
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the world as he saw it now to the rulers of Lys and Diaspar.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Theon," he said at last, "do you think that what I'm
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 doing is right?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The question surprised Theon, who as yet knew nothing
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the sudden doubts that sometimes overwhelmed his friend.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Nor was it\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  easy to answer dispassionately: like Rorden, though
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 with less cause, Theon felt that his own character was becoming
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 submerged. He was being sucked helplessly into the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 vortex which Alvin left behind him on his way through life.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I believe you are right," T\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 heon answered slowly. "Our
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 two people have been separated for long enough." That, he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 thought, was true, though he knew that his own feelings
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 must bias his reply. But Alvin was still worried.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "There's one problem I haven't thought about until now,"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he conti\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 nued in a troubled voice, "and that's the difference
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in our life-spans." He said no more, but each knew what the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 other was thinking.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I've been worrying about that a good deal," Theon admitted,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "but I think the problem will solve itself when our
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 people get\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  to know each other again. We can't both be right
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 --our lives may be too short and yours are certainly too long.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 In time there will be a compromise."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin wondered. That way, it was true, lay the only hope, but the ages of transition would be hard indeed.\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  He remembered
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 again those bitter words of Seranis: "We shall
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 both be dead when you are still a boy." Very well: he would
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 accept the conditions. Even in Diaspar all friendships lay
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 under the same shadow: whether it was a hundred or a million
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 years away made little difference at the end. The welfare
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the race demanded the mingling of the two cultures: in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 such a cause individual happiness was unimportant. For a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 moment Alvin saw humanity as something more than the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 living background of his own l\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ife, and he accepted without
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 flinching the unhappiness his choice must one day bring.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 They never spoke of it again.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Beneath them the world continued on its endless turning.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Sensing his friend's mood, Theon said nothing, and presently
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin broke the silenc\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e again.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "When I first left Diaspar," he said, "I did not know what
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 I hoped to find. Lys would have satisfied me once--but now
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 127
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 even-thing on Earth seems so small and unimportant Each
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 discovery I've made has raised bigger ques\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 tions and now I'll
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 never be content until I know who the Master was and why
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he came to Earth. If I ever learn that, then I suppose I'll
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 start to worry about the Great Ones and the Invaders--and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 so it will go on."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Theon had never seen Alvin in so thoughtful\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  a mood and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 did not wish to interrupt his soliloquy. He had learnt a great
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 deal about his friend in the last few minutes.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "The robot told me," Alvin continued, "that this machine
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 can reach the Seven Suns in less than half a day Do you
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 think I should go?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Do you think I could stop you?" Theon replied quietly
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin smiled.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "That's no answer," he said, "even if it's true. We don't
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 know what's out there in space. The Invaders may have left
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the Universe, but there may be other intelligences unfriendly
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to man."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Why should there be?" Theon asked. "That's one of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 questions our philosophers have been debating for ages A
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 trulv intelligent race is not likely to be unfriendly "
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "But the Invaders--?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Theon pointed to the unending deserts below.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Once we had an Empir\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e. What have we now that they
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 would covet?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin was a little surprised at this novel point of view.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Do all your people think like this?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Only a minority. The average person doesn't worry about
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it, but would probably say that if the Invaders really want\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to destroy Earth they'd have done it ages ago. Only a few
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 people, like Mother, are still afraid of them."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Things are very different in Diaspar," Alvin said. "My
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 people are great cowards. But it's unfortunate about your
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Mother--do you think she would st\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 op you coming with me?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "She most certainly would," Theon replied with emphasis
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 That Alvin had taken his own assent for granted he scarcely
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 noticed.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin thought for a moment.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "By now she'll have heard about thre ship and will know
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 what I intend to do. We\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  mustn't return to Airlee."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "No: that wouldn't be safe. But I have a better plan."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 THE LITTLE VILLAGE IN WHICH THEY LANDED WAS ONLY A
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 dozen miles from Airlee, but Alvin was surprised to see how
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 128 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 greatly it differed in architecture and setting. The houses
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were several stones in height and had been built along the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 curve of a lake, looking out across the water. A large number
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of brightly colored vessels were floating at anchor along the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 shore, they f\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ascinated Alvin who had never heard of such
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 things and wondered what they were for.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He waited in the ship while Theon went to see his friends.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was amusing to watch the consternation and amazement
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the people crowding round, unaware of the fact that he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was observing them from inside the machine. Theon was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 gone only a few minutes and had some difficulty in reaching
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the air-lock through the inquisitive crowds. He breathed a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sigh of relief as the door closed behind him.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Mother will get the message in two \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 or three minutes. I've
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 not said where we're going, but she'll guess quickly enough.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 And I've got some news that will interest you."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "What is it?'-'
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "The Central Council is going to hold talks with Diaspar."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 What!"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "It's perfectly true, though the announcem\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ent hasn't been
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 made yet. That sort of thing can't be kept secret."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin could appreciate this: he never understood how
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 anything was ever kept secret in Lys.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "What are they discussing?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Probably ways in which they can stop us leaving. That's
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 why I came b\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ack in a hurry."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin smiled a little ruefully.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "So you think that fear may have succeeded where logic
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and persuasion failed?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Quite likely, though you made a real impression on the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 councillors last night. They were talking for a long time after
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 you went to sleep."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Whatever the cause of this move, Alvin felt very pleased.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Diaspar and Lys had both been slow to react, but events
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were now moving swiftly to their climax. That the climax
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 might have unpleasant consequences for him Alvin did not
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 greatly \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mind.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 They were very high when he gave the robot its final
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 instructions. The ship had come almost to rest and the Earth
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was perhaps a thousand miles below, nearly filling the sky.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It looked very uninviting: Alvin wondered how many ships
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in the past had hov\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ered here for a little while and then continued
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 on their way.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There was an appreciable pause, as if the robot was checking
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 controls and circuits that had not been used for geological
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ages. Then came a very faint sound, the first that Alvin had
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  FALL OF NIGHT 129
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ever heard from the machine. It was a tiny humming, which
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 soared swiftly octave by octave until it was lost at the edge
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of hearing. There was no sense of change or motion, but
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 suddenly he noticed that the stars were drifting across the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 s\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 creen. The Earth reappeared, and rolled past--then appeared
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 again, in a slightly different position. The ship was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "hunting," swinging in space like a compass needle seeking
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the north. For minutes the skies turned and twisted around
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 them, until at last the ship came to rest, a giant projectile
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 aimed at the stars.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Centered in the screen the great ring of the Seven Suns
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 lay in its rainbow-hued beaut\}'. A little of Earth was still
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 visible as a dark crescent edged with the gold and crimso\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 n of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the sunset. Something was happening now, Alvin knew,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 beyond all his experience. He waited, gripping his seat, while
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the seconds drifted by and the Seven Suns glittered on the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 screen.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There was no sound, only a sudden wrench that seemed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to blur the vis\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ion--but Earth had vanished as if a giant hand
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had whipped it away. They were alone in space, alone with
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the stars and a strangely shrunken sun. Earth was gone as
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 though it had never been.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Again came that wrench, and with it now the faintest
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 murmur of soun\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 d, as if for the first time the generators were
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 exerting some appreciable fraction of their power. Yet for
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a moment it seemed that nothing had happened: then Alvin
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 realized that the sun itself was gone and that the stars were
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 creeping slowly past the. ship\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 . He looked back for an instant
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and saw--nothing. All the heavens behind had vanished
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 utterly, obliterated by a hemisphere of night. Even as he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 watched, he could see the stars plunge into it, to disappear
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 like sparks falling upon water. The ship was travel\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ling far
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 faster than light, and Alvin knew that the familiar space of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Earth and Sun held him no more.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 When that sudden, vertiginous wrench came for the third
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 time, his heart almost stopped beating. The strange blurring
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of vision was unmistakable now: for a moment, his surroundings
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seemed distorted out of recognition. The meaning of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that distortion came to him in a flash of insight he could not
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 explain. It was real, and no delusion of his eves. Somehow
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he was catching, as\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  he passed through the thin film of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Present, a glimpse of the changes that were occurring in the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Space around him.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 At the same instant the murmur of the generators rose to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a roar that shook the ship--a sound doublv impressive for it
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was the first cry o\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 f protest that Alvin had ever heard from
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 130 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a machine. Then it was all over, and the sudden silence
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seemed to ring in his ears. The great generators had done
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ireir work. they would not be needed again until the end
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the voyage\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 . The stars ahead flared blue-white and vanished
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 into the ultra-violet. Yet by some magic of Science or Nature
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the Seven Suns were still visible, though now their positions
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and colcrs were subtly changed. The ship was hurtling toward' them along a tunnel o\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 f darkness, beyond the boundaries
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of space and time, at a velocity too enormous for the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mind to contemplate.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was hard to believe that they had now been flung out
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the Solar System at a speed which unless it were checked would soon take them through th\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e heart of the Galaxy and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 into the greater emptiness beyond. Neither Alvin nor Theon
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 truld conceive the real immensity of their journey: the great
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Sagas of exploration had completely changed Man's outlook
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 towards the Universe and even now, millions of cent\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 uries
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 later, the ancient traditions had not wholly died. There had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 once been a ship, legend whispered, that had circumnavigated The Cosmos between the rising and the setting of the sun.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The billions of miles between the stars meant nothing before ?uch speeds. To Alvin this voyage was very little greater, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 perhaps less dangerous, than his first journey to Lys.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was Theon who voiced both their thoughts as the Seven
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Sun' slowly brighten\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ed ahead.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Alvin," he remarked, "that formation can't possibly be |
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 natural."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The other nodded.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I've thought that for years, but it still seems fantastic."

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 by hour the Seven Suns drifted apart until they had filled
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that strange tunnel of night in w\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hich the ship was riding.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Then, one by one, the six outer stars vanished at the brink
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of darkness and at last only the Centra] Sun was left Though
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it could no longer be fully in their space, it still shone with
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the pearly light that marked it out from all \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 other stars
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Minute by minute its brilliance increased, until presently it
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was no longer a point but a tiny disc. And now the disc was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 beginning to expand before them--
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There was the briefest of warnings: for a moment a deep,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 bell-like note vibrated through the room. Alvin clenched the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 arms of his chair, though it was a futile enough gesture.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Once again the great generators exploded into life, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 with an abruptness that was almost blinding, the stars reappeared.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The ship had d\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ropped back into space, back into the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Universe of suns and planets, the natural world where nothing
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 could move more swiftly than light.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 They were already within the system of the Seven Suns,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for the great ring of colored globes now dominated the sky.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 And w\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hat a sky it was! All the stars they had known, all the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 familiar constellations, had gone. The Milky Way was no longer a faint band of mist far to one side of the heavens:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 they were now at the centre of creation, and its great circle
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 divided the Universe i\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 n twain.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The ship was still moving very swiftly towards the Central
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Sun, and the six remaining stars of the system were colored
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 beacons ranged around the sky. Not far from the nearest of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 them were the tiny sparks of circling planets, worlds that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 must have \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 been of enormous size to be visible over such a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 distance. It was a sight grander than anything Nature had

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 This superb symmetry was a deliberate challenge to the star\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 s
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 scattered aimlessly around it.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The cause of the Central Sun's nacreous light was now
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 clearly visible. The great star, surely one of the most brilliant
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in the whole Universe, was shrouded in an envelope of gas
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 which softened its radiation and gave it its characteristic
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 color. The surrounding nebula could be seen only indirectly,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and it was twisted into strange shapes that eluded the eye.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 But it was there, and the longer one stared the more extensive
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it seemed to\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  be.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin wondered where the robot was taking them. Was it
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 following some ancient memory, or were there guiding signals
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in the space around them? He had left their destination
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 entirely to the machine, and presently he noticed the pale
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 spark of light towar\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ds which they were travelling. It was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 almost lost in the glare of the Central Sun, and around it
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were the yet fainter gleams of other worlds. Their enormous
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 journey was coming to its end.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The planet was now only a few million miles away, a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 beautiful sphere\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  of multicolored light. There could be no
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 darkness anywhere upon its surface, for as it turned beneath
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the Central Sun, the other stars would march one by one
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 across its skies. Alvin now saw very clearly the meaning of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the Master's dying words: "It is love\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ly to watch the colored
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 shadows on the planets of eternal light."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Now they were so close that they could see continents and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 oceans and a faint haze of atmosphere. Yet there was something
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 puzzling about its markings, and presently they realized
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that the div\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 isions between land and water were curiously
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 regular. This planet's continents were not as Nature had left
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 them--but how small a task the shaping of a world must
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 have been to those who built its suns!
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Those aren't oceans at alll" Theon exclaimed suddenly.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Look--you can see markings in them!"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Not until the planet was nearer could Alvin see clearly
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 what his friend meant. Then he noticed faint bands and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 lines along the continental borders, well inside what he had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 taken to be the limits of the sea. The sight \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 filled him with a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sudden doubt, for he knew too well the meaning of those
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 lines. He had see them once before in the desert beyond
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Diaspar, and they told him that his journey had been in vain.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "This planet is as dry as Eearth," he said dully. "It's water
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ha\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 s all gone--those markings are the salt-beds where the seas
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 have evaporated."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "They would never have let that happen," replied Theon.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I think that, after all, we are too late."
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 135
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 His disappointment was so bitter that Alvin did\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  not trust
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 himself to speak again but stared silently at the great world
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ahead. With impressive slowness the planet turned beneath
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the ship, and its surface rose majestically to meet them. Now
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 they could see buildings--minute white crustations everywhere
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 s\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ave on the ocean beds themselves.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Once this world had been the centre of the Universe. Now
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it was still, the air was empty and on the ground were none
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the scurrying dots that spoke of life. Yet the ship was still
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sliding purposefully over the frozen sea\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  of stone--a sea which
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 here and there had gathered itself into great waves that challenged
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the sky.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Presently the ship came to rest, as if the robot had at last
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 traced its memories to their source. Below them was a column
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of snow-white stone springing from the center of an immense
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 marble amphitheater. Alvin waited for a little while- then,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 as the machine remained motionless, he directed it to land
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 at the foot or the pillar.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Even until now, Alvin had half hoped to find life \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 on this
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 planet. That hope vanished instantly as he left the airlock.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Never before in his life, even in the desolation of Shalmirane,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had he been in utter silence. On Earth there was always the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 murmur of voices, the stir of living creatures, or the sighing
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the wind. Here were none of these, nor ever would be
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 again.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Why the machine had brought them to this place there
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was no way of telling, but Alvin knew that the choice made
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 little difference. The great column of white stone was perhaps
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 twenty times the h\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 eight of a man, and was set in a circle of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 metal slightly raised above the level of the plain. It was featureless
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and of its purpose there was no hint. They might
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 guess, but they would never know, that it had once marked
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the zero point of all astronomical \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 measurements.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 So this, thought Alvin sadly, was the end of all his searching.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He knew that it would be useless to visit the other worlds
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the Seven Suns. Even if there was still intelligence in the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Universe, where could he seek it now? He had seen the st\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ars
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 scattered like dust across the heavens, and he knew that what
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was left of Time was not enough to explore them all.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Suddenly a feeling of loneliness and oppression such as he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had never before experienced seemed to overwhelm him. He
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 could understand now the fear of Diaspar for the great spaces
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the Universe, the tenor that had made his people gather
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in the little microcosm of their city. It was hard to believe
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that, after all, they had been right.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He turned to Theon for support, but\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  Theon was standing,

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "What's the matter?" Alvin asked in alarm.

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the ages since he had wandered from sun to sun, slowly
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 evolving and increasing his powers. Once he had dreamed of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 finding again those who had attended his birth, and though
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the drea\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 m had faded now, it had never wholly died.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 On countless worlds he had found the wreckage that life
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had left behind, but intelligence he had discovered only
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 once\hich\f39 \emdash \loch\f39 and from the Black Sun he had fled in terror. Yet the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Universe was very large, and the search h\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ad scarcely begun.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Far away though it was in space and time, the great burst of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 power from the heart of the Galaxy beckoned to Vanamonde
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 across the light-years. It was utterly unlike the radiation of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the stars, and it had appeared in his field of consciousness as
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 suddenly as a meteor trail across a cloudless sky. He moved
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 towards it, to the latest moment of its existence, sloughing
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 from him in the way he knew the dead, unchanging pattern
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the past.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 H\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e knew this place, for he had been here before. It had

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 metal shape lying upon the plain he could not understand,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for it was as strange to him as almost all the things of the

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to him now Carefully, with the delicate nervousness of a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 wild beast half poised for flight, he reached out towards the

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 under a cloud, his presence was so obviously essential
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that no one had suggested excluding him\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 . The six visitors

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 but decided that they would not have broken the solemn
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 assurance without which this meeting would have been impossible.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden did not \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 think that much progress had been made:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for that matter, he did not see how it could be. Alvin had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 gone into space, and nothing could alter that. The Council,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 which had not yet fully accepted Lys, still seemed incapable
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of realizing what had happened. But \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it was clearly frightened,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and so were most of the visitors. Rorden himself was not as
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 terriSed as he had expected: his fears were still there, but he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had faced them at last. Something of Alvin's own reckless- ness--or was it courage?--had changed his outl\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ook and given
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 him new horizons.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The President's question caught him unawares but he recovered
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 himself quickly.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I think," he said, "it's sheer chance that this situation
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 never arose before. There was nothing we could have done
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to stop it, for events were a\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 lways ahead of us." Everyone knew
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that by 'events' he meant Alvin, but there were no comments.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "It's futile to bicker about the past: Diaspar and Lys have
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 both made mistakes. When Alvin returns, you may prevent
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 him leaving Earth again--if you can. I don't \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 think you will
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 succeed, for he may have leamt a great deal by then. But if
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 what you fear has happened, there's nothing any of us can do

\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 140 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 about it. Earth is helpless--as she has been for millions of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 centuries."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden paused and glanced along the table. His words had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 pleased no one, nor had he expected them to do so.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Yet I don't see why we should be so alarmed. Earth is in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 no greater danger now than she has always been. Why should
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 two boys in a single small ship\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  bring the wrath of the Invaders
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 down upon us again? If we'll be honest with ourselves, we
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 must admit that the Invaders could have destroyed our world
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ages ago."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There was a shocked silence. This was heresy--but Rorden
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was interested to notice that two of \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the visitors seemed to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 approve.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The President interrupted, frowning heavily.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Is there not a legend that the Invaders spared Earth itself
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 only on condition that Man never went into space again? And
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 have we not now broken those conditions?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Once I too beli\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 eved that," said Rorden. "We accept many
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 things without question, and this is one of them. But my
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 machines know nothing of legend, only of truth--and there
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 is no historical record of such an agreement. I am convinced
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that anything so important would have b\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 een permanently
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 recorded, as many lesser matters have been."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin, he thought, would have been proud of him now.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was strange that he should be defending the boy's ideas,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 when If Alvin himself had been present he might well have
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 been attacking them. One\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  at least of his dreams had come
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 true: the relationship between Lys and Diaspar was still unstable,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 but it was a beginning. Where, he wondered, was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin now?
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ALVIN HAD SEEN OK HEARD NOTHING, BUT HE DID NOT STOP
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to argue. Only when the air-lock had closed behind them
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 did he turn to his friend.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "What was it?" he asked a little breathlessly.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I don't know: it was something terrific. I think it's still
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 watching us."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Shall we leave?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "No: I was frightened at first, b\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ut I don't think it will
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 harm us. It seems simply--interested."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin was about to reply when he was suddenly overwhelmed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 by a sensation unlike any he had ever known before.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 A warm, tingling glow seemed to spread through his body:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it lasted only a few seco\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 nds, but when it was gone he was no
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 longer Alvin of Loronei. Something was sharing his brain,
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 141
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 overlapping it as one circle may partly cover another He
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was conscious, also, of Theon's mind close at hand, equally
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 entangled in w\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hatever creature had descended upon them.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The sensation was strange rather than unpleasant, and it gave
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin his Erst glimpse of true telepathy--the power which in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his race had so degenerated that it could now be used only
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to control machines.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin had r\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ebelled at once when Seranis had tried to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 dominate his mind, but he did not struggle against this intrusion.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It would have been useless, and he knew that this
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 intelligence, whatever it might be, was not unfriendly. He
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 relaxed completely, accepting without resistance the fact that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 an infinitely greater intelligence than his own was exploring
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his mind. But in that belief, be was not wholly right.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 One of these minds, Vanamonde saw at once, was more
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sympathetic and accessib\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 le than the other. He could tell that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 both were filled with wonder at his presence, and that surprised
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 him greatly. It was hard to believe that they could
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 have forgotten: forgetfulness, like mortality, was beyond the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 comprehension of Vanamonde.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Communicati\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 on was very difficult: many of the thought-
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 images in their minds were so strange that he could hardly
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 recognize them. He was puzzled and a little frightened by
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the recurrent fear-pattern of the Invaders; it reminded him
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of his own emotions when the Black \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Sun first came into his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 field of knowledge.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 But they knew nothing of the Black Sun, and now their
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 own questions were beginning to form in his mind
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "What are you?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He gave the only reply he could.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I am Vanamonde."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There came a pause (how long the pattern o\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 f their thoughts
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 took to form!) and then the question was repeated. They had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 not understood: that was strange, for surely their kind had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 given him his name for it to be among the memories of his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 birth. Those memories were very few, and they began
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 strangely\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  at a single point in time, but they were crystal-clear,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Again their tiny thoughts struggled up into his consciousness.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Who were the Great Ones--arc you one of them yourself?"
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He did not know: they could scarcely believe him, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 their disappointment came sharp and clear across the abyss
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 separating their minds from his. But they were patient and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he was glad to help them, for their quest was the same as his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and they gave him the first companionship he had ever known,
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 142\tab AGAINST TH\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 E FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 As long as he lived, Alvin did not believe he would ever
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 again undergo so strange an experience as this soundless
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 conversation. It was hard to believe that he could be little
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 more than a spectator, for he did not care to admit, even to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hims\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 elf, that Theon's mind was so much more powerful than
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his own. He could only wait and wonder, half dazed by the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 torrent of thought just beyond the limits of his understanding.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Presently Theon, rather pale and strained, broke off the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 contact and turned to \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his friend.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Alvin," he .said, his voice very tired, "there's something
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 strange here. I don't understand it at all."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The news did a little to restore Alvin's self-esteem, and

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 not unsympathetic \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 laugh.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I can't discover what this--Vanamonde--is," he continued.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "It's a creature of tremendous knowledge, but it
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seems to have very little intelligence. Of course," he added,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "it's mind may be of such a different order that we can't
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 understand it--\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 yet somehow I don't believe that is the right
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 explanation."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Well, what have you learned?" asked Alvin with some
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 impatience. "Does it know anything about this place?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Theon's mind still seemed very far away.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "This city was built by many. races, including o\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ur own," he said absently. "It can give me facts like that, but it doesn't
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seem to understand their meaning. I believe it's conscious
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the Past, without being able to interpret it. Everything
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that's ever happened seems jumbled together in its mind."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He p\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 aused thoughtfully for a moment: then his face
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 lightened.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "There's only one thing to do: somehow or other, we
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 must get Vanamonde to Earth so that our philosophers can
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Study him."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Would that be safe?" asked Alvin.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Yes," answered Theon, thinking how unchar\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 acteristic
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his friend's remark was. "Vanamonde is friendly. More than
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that, in fact--he seems almost affectionate."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 And quite suddenly the thought that all the while had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 been hovering at the edge of Alvin's consciousness came
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 clearly into view. He remember\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ed Krif and all the small animals
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that were constantly escaping ("It won't happen again,

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to Shalmirane.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Theon had found a new pet.

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 thought of concealment now. Alvin wondered if ever in human
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 history any ship had brought such a cargo to Earth--if
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 indeed Vanamonde was located in the physical space of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 machine. There had been no sign of him on the voyage:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Theon believed, and his knowledge was more direct, that only
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Vanambnde's sphere of attention could be said to have any
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 location in space.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 As they left the ship the doors closed softly behind them
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and a \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sudden wind tugged at their clothes. Then the machine
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was only a silver dot falling into the sky, returning to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the world where it belonged until Alvin should need it again.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Seranis was waiting for them as Theon had known and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin had half expected. She lo\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 oked at the boys in silence for a while, then said quietly to Alvin:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "You're making life rather complicated for us, aren't you?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There was no rancor in the words, only a half-humorous
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 resignation and even a dawning approval.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin sensed her meaning at onc\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Then Vanamonde's arrived?"

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin looked at her in amazement. Then he understood:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 it was not hard to imagine what the impact of Vanamonde

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 unlimited. But he's childish, and I mean that quite literally."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Of course!" cried Theon. "I should have guessed!"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin looked puzzled and Seranis took pity on him.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I mean that although Vanamonde has a colossal, perhaps
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 an infinite mind, he's immature and undeveloped. His actual
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 intelligence is less than that of a hu\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 man being"--she smiled
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a little wryly--"though his thought processes are much faster and he learns very quickly. He also has some powers we dp
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 not yet understand. The whole of the past seems open to his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mind, in a way that's difficult to "describe. He must\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  have used
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that ability to follow your path back to Earth."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin stood in silence, for once somewhat overcome. He
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 realized how right Theon had been to bring Vanamonde to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Lys. And he knew how lucky he had been ever to outwit
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Seranis: that was not something\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  he would do twice in a lifetime.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Do you mean," he asked, "that Vanamonde has only just
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 been born?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "By his standards, yes. His actual age is very great, though
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 apparently less than Man's. The extraordinary thing is that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he insists that we created him, a\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 nd there's no doubt that his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 origin is bound up with all the great mysteries of the past."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "What's happening to Vanamonde now?" asked Theon
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in a slightly possessive voice.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "The historians of Grevam are questioning him. They are
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 trying to map out the main o\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 utlines of the past, but the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 work will take years. Vanamonde can describe the past in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 perfect detail, but as he doesn't understand what he sees it's
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 very difficult to work with him."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin wondered how Seranis knew all this: then he realized
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that probably every waking mind in Lys was watching the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 progress of the great research.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Rorden should be here," he said, coming to a sudden
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 decision. "I'm going to Diaspar to fetch him."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "And Jeserac," he added, in a determined afterthought.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden had ne\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ver seen a whirlwind, but if one had hit
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 him the experience would have felt perfectly familiar. There
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were times when his sense of reality ceased to function, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the feeling that everything was a dream became almost overwhelming.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 This was such a moment no\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 w.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He closed his eyes and tried to recall the familiar room in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Diaspar which had once been both a part of his personality
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and a barrier against the outer world. What would he have
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 thought, he wondered, could he have looked into the future
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 when he had 6rst \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 met Alvin and seen the outcome of that
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 147
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 encounter? But of one thing he was sure and a little proud
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he would not have turned aside.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The boat was moving slowly across the lake with a gentle
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 rocking motion that Rorden found rathe\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 r pleasant. Why the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 village of Grevam had been built on an island he could not
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 imagine: it seemed a most inconvenient arrangement. It was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 true that the colored houses, which seemed to float at anchor
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 upon the tiny waves, made a scene of almost unreal beaut\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 y
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 That was all very well, thought Rorden, but one couldn't
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 spend the whole of one's life staring at scenery. Then he remembered
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that this was precisely what many of these eccentric
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 people did.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Eccentric or not, they had minds he could respect. To
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 him the thoughts of Vanamonde were as meaningless as a
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 thousand voices shouting together in some vast, echoing cave.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Yet the men of Lys could disentangle them, could record
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 them to be analyzed at leisure. Already the structure of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 past, which had once s\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 eemed lost forever, was becoming
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 faintly visible. And it was so strange and unexpected that it
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 appeared to bear no resemblance at all to the history that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden had always believed.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 In a few months he would present his first report to Diaspar.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Though its c\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ontents were still uncertain, he knew that it
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 would end forever the sterile isolation of his race. The barriers
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 between Lys and Diaspar would vanish when their origin was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 understood, and the mingling of the two great cultures would
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 invigorate mankind for a\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ges to come. Yet even this now
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seemed no more than a minor by-product of the great research
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that was just beginning. If what Vanamonde had hinted was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 indeed true, Man's horizons must soon embrace not merely
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the Earth, but must enfold the stars and reach ou\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 t to the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Galaxies beyond. But of these further vistas it was still too
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 early to be sure.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Calitrax, chief historian of Lys, met them at the little
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 jetty. He was a tall, slightly stooping man and Rorden wondered
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 how, without the help of the Masters Associato\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 rs, he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had ever managed to learn so much in his short life. It did
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 not occur to him that the very absence of such machines was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the reason for the wonderful memories he had met in Crevam.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 They walked together beside one of the innumerable canals
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that made life in the village so hazardous to strangers. Calitrax
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seemed a little preoccupied, and Rorden knew that part of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 his mind was still with Vanamonde.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Have you settled your date-fixing procedure yet?" asked
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden presently, feeling somewhat negle\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 cted.
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 148 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Calitrax remembered his duties as host and broke contact
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 with obvious reluctance.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Yes," he said. "It had to be the astronomical method. We
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 think it's accurate to ten thousand years even back to the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Dawn Ages. It could \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 be even better, but that's good enough
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to mark out the main epochs."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "What about the Invaders? Has Bensor located them?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "No: he made one attempt but it's hopeless to look for
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 any isolated period. What we're doing now is to go back to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the beginning of hist\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ory and then take cross-sections at regular
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 intervals. We'll link them together by guesswork until we
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 can fill in the details. If only Vanamonde could interpret
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 what he sees! As it is we have to work through masses of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 irrelevant material."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I wonder what h\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e thinks about the whole affair: it must
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 all be rather puzzling to him."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Yes, I suppose it must. But he's very docile and friendly,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and I think he's happy, if one can use that word. So Theon
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 believes, and they seem to have a curious sort of affinity. Ah,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 here's Bensor with the latest ten million years of history. I'll leave you in his hands."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 THE COUNCIL CHAMBER HAD ALTERED LITTLE SINCE ALVIN'S
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 last visit, for the seldom-used projection equipment was so
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 inconspicuous that one could easily have overlooked i\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 t. There
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were two empty chairs along the great table: one, he knew,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was Jeserac's. But though he was in Lys, Jeserac would be
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 watching this meeting, as would almost all the world.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 If Rorden recalled their last appearance in this room, he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 did not care to me\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ntion it. But the councillors certainly remembered,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 as Alvin could tell by the ambiguous glances he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 received. He wondered what they would be thinking when
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 they had heard Rorden's story. Already, in a few months, the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Present had changed out of all recogniti\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 on--and now they
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were going to lose the Past.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden began to speak. The great ways of Diaspar would
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 be empty of traffic: the city would be hushed as Alvin had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 known it only once before in his life. It was waiting, waiting
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for the veil of the past to be li\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 fted again after--if Calitrax
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was right--more than fifteen hundred million years.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Very briefly, Rordan ran through the accepted history of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the race--the history that both Diaspar and Lys had always
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 believed beyond question. He spoke of the unknown peoples
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the Dawn Civilizations, who had left behind them nothing
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 149
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 but a handful of great names and the fading legends of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Empire. Even at the beginning, so the story went, Man had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 desired the stars and at lart attained them. For\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  millions of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 years he had expanded across the Galaxy, gathering system
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 after system beneath his sway. Then, out of the darkness
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 beyond the rim of the Universe, the Invaders had struck and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 wrenched from him all that he had won.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The retreat to the Solar System had been bitter and must
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 have lasted many ages. Earth itself was barely saved by the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 fabulous battles that raged round Shalmirane. When all was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 over, Man was left with only his memories and the world on
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 which he had been bor\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 n.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Rorden paused: he looked round the great room and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 smiled slightly as his eyes met Alvin's.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "So much for the tales we have believed since our records
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 began. I must tell you now that they are false--false in every
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 detail--so false that even now we have no\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 t fully reconciled them with the truth."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He waited for the full meaning of his words to strike
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 home. Then, speaking slowly and carefully, but after the Erst
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 few minutes never consulting his notes, he gave the city the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 knowledge that had been won from the m\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ind of Vanamonde.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was not even true that Man had reached the stars. The
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 whole of his little empire was bounded by the orbit of Perse-
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 phone, for interstellar space proved a barrier beyond his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 power to cross. His entire civilization was huddled round the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sun, and was still very young when--the stars reached him.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The impact must have been shattering. Despite his failures,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Man had never doubted that one day he would conquer the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 deeps of space. He believed too that if the Universe held his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 equals, it did not\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  hold his peers. Now he knew that both
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 beliefs were wrong, and that out among the stars were minds
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 far greater than his own. For many centuries, first in the ships
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of other races and later in machines built with borrowed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 knowledge, Man had \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 explored the Galaxy. Everywhere he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 found cultures he could understand but could not match, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 here and there he encountered minds which would soon have
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 passed altogether beyond his comprehension.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The shock was tremendous, but it proved the making of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the r\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ace. Sadder and infinitely wiser, Man had returned to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the Solar System to brood upon the knowledge he had gained.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He would accept the challenge and slowly he evolved a plan
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 which gave hope for the future.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Once the physical sciences had been Man's greatest \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 interest.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Now he turned even more fiercely to genetics and the
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 150 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 study of the mind. Whatever the cost, he would drive himself
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to the limits of his evolution.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The great experiment had consumed the entire energies
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the race for\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  millions of years. All that striving, all that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 sacri5ce and toil, became only a handful of words in Rorden's
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 narrative. It had brought Man his greatest victories. He had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 banished disease: he could live forever if he wished, and in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 mastering telepathy he h\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ad bent the most subtle of all powers

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 These things he did. From this age, perhaps the most
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 spacious in off history, came the legends of the Empire. It
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had been an Empire of many races, but this had been forgotten
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 in the drama, too tremendous for tragedy, in which it had come to its end.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The Empire had lasted for at least a billion years. It must
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 have known many crises, perhaps even wars, but all these
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were lost in the sweep of great races moving together towards
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ma\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 turity.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We can be proud," continued Rorden, "of the part our
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ancestors played in this story. Even when they had reached
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 their cultural plateau, they lost none of their initiative. We
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 deal now with conjecture rather than proven fact, but it
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seems certain t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hat the experiments which were at once the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Empire's downfall and its crowning glory were inspired and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 directed by Man.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "The philosophy underlying these experiments appears to
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 have been this. Contact with other species had shown Man
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 how profoundly a race's \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 world-picture depended upon its
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 physical body and the sense organs with which it was equipped.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was argued that a true picture of the Universe could be
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 attained, if at all, only by a mind which was free from such
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 physical limitations--a pure mentality, i\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 n fact. This idea was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 common among most very ancient religions and was believed
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 by many to be the goal of evolution.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "Largely as a result of the experience gained in his own
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 regeneration, Man suggested that the creation of such beings
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 should be attempted. \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was the greatest challenge ever thrown
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 out to intelligence in the Universe, and after centuries of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 debate it was accepted. All the races of the Galaxy joined
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 together in its fulfilment.

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was either insane or, as seems more likely from other sources,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was implacably\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  hostile to matter. For centuries it ravaged the

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 marvel, the great experiment was resumed and a search made
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 for the flaw that had caused the catastrophe. There were
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 now, of course, many who opposed\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  the work and predicted

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 seems likely that they knew it to be inevitable. Millions of

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "until more important problems have been settled. In any
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 case, I can picture Ala\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ine's mind rather well: once we must
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 have had a good deal in common."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 They walked in silence for a few hundred yards, following
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the edge of the great excavation. The Tomb of Yarlan Zey
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was now poised on the brink of a chasm, at the bottom of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 which scores o\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 f robots were working furiously.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "By the way," said Alvin abruptly, "did you know that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Jeserac is staying in Lys? Jeserac, of all people! He likes it
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 there and won't come back. Of course, that will leave a vacancy
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 on the Council."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "So it will," replied Rorden, as if he had never given the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 matter any thought. A short time ago he could have imagined
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 very few things more unlikely than a seat on the Council;
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 now it was probably only a matter of time. There would, he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 reflected, be a good\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  many other resignations in the near
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 future. Several of the older councillors had found themselves
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 unable to face the new problems pouring upon them.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 They were now moving up the slope to the Tomb, through
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the long avenue of eternal trees. At its end, the a\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 venue was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 blocked by Alvin's ship, looking strangely out of place in
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 these familiar surroundings.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "There," said Rorden suddenly, "is the greatest mystery of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 all. Who was the Master? Where did he get this ship and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the three robots?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I've been thinking abou\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 t that," answered Theon. "We
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 know that he came from the Seven Suns, and there might
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 have been a fairly high culture there when civilization on
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Earth was at its lowest. The ship itself is obviously the work
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of the Empire.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I believe that the Master was esca\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ping from his own
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 people. Perhaps he had ideas with which they didn't agree:
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he was a philosopher, and a rather remarkable one. He found
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 our ancestors friendly but superstitious and tried to educate
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 them, but they misunderstood and distorted his teachings.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The Great Ones were no more than the men of the Empire
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 --only it wasn't Earth they had left, but the Universe itself.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The Master's disciples didn't understand or didn't believe
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 this, and all their mythology and ritual was founded on that
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 158 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 false premise. One day I intend to go into the Master's history
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 and find why he tried to conceal his past. I think it will
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 be a very interesting story."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "We've a good deal to thank him for," said Rorden as
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 they entered the shi\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 p. "Without him we would never have
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 learned the truth about the past."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I'm not so sure," said Alvin. "Sooner or later Vanamonde
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 would have discovered us. And I believe there may be other
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ships hidden on Earth: one day I mean to find them."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The city was no\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 w too distant to be recognized as the work
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of man, and the curve of the planet was becoming visible. In
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 a little while they could see the line of twilight, thousands
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of miles away on its never-ending march across the desert.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Above and around were the stars\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 , still brilliant for all the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 glory they had lost.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 For a long time Rorden stared at the desolate panorama
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he had never seen before. He felt a sudden contemptuous
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 anger for the men of the past who had let Earth's beauty
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 die through their own neglect. If one\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  of Alvin's dreams came
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 true, and the great transmutation plants still existed, it
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 would not be many centuries before the oceans rolled again.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There was so much to do in the years ahead. Rorden knew
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that he stood between two ages: around him he could feel
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the pulse of mankind beginning to quicken again. There
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were great problems to be faced, and Diaspar would face
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 them. The recharting of the past would take centuries, but
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 when it was finished Man would have recovered all that he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had lost. And always now in the background would be the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 great enigma of Vanamonde--
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 If Calitrax was right, Vanamonde had already evolved
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 more swiftly than his creators had expected, and the philosophers
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 of Lys had great hopes of future co-operation which t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 hey
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 would confide to no one. They had become very attached
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 to the childlike supermind, and perhaps they believed that
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 they could foreshorten the eons which his natural evolution
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 would require. But Rorden knew that the ultimate destiny of
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Vanamonde was some\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 thing in which Man would play no
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 part. He had dreamed, and he believed the dream was true,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 that at the end of the Universe Vanamonde and the Mad
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Mind must meet each other among the corpses of the stars.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin broke into his reverie and Rorden turned from t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 screen.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I wanted you to see this," said Alvin quietly. "It may be
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 many centuries before you have another chance."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "You're not leaving Earth?"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "No: even if there are other civilizations in this Galaxy, I
\par \page \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT 159
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 doubt if they'd be\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  worth the trouble of finding. And there
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 is so much to do here--"
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin looked down at the great deserts, but his eyes saw
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 instead the waters that would be sweeping over them a thousand
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 years from now. Man had rediscovered his world, and
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he would make it b\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 eautiful while he remained upon it. And
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 after that--
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 "I am going to send this ship out of the Galaxy, to follow
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the Empire wherever it has gone. The search may take ages,
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 but the robot will never tire. One day our cousins will receive
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 my message, and they'll know that we are waiting for them
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 here on Earth. They will return, and I hope that by then
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 we'll be worthy of them, however great they have become."
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Alvin fell silent, staring into the future he had shaped but
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 which he might never s\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ee. While Man was rebuilding his
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 world, this ship would be crossing the darkness between the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 galaxies, and in thousands of years to come it would return.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Perhaps he would be there to meet it, but if not, he was
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 well content.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 They were now above the Pole, a\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 nd the planet beneath
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 them was an almost perfect hemisphere. Looking down upon
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 the belt of twilight, Alvin realized that he was seeing at one
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 instant both sunrise and sunset on opposite sides of the
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 world. The symbolism was so perfect and so striking that \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 he
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 was to remember this moment all his life.
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 IN THIS UNIVERSE THE NIGHT WAS FALLING: THE SHADOWS
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 were lengthening towards an east that would not know another
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 dawn. But elsewhere the stars were still young and the light of morning lingered; and along the pa\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 th he once had
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 followed, Man would one day go again.
