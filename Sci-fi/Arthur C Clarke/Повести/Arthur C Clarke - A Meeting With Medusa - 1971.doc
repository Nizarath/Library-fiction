\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The Queen Elizabeth was over three miles above the Grand Canyon, dawdling along at a comfortable hundred and eighty, when Howard Falcon spotted the camera platform closing in from the right. He had been expecting it 
\hich\f39 \emdash \loch\f39 nothing else was cleared to fly at thi\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 s\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  altitude \hich\f39 \emdash \loch\f39 
 but he was not too happy to have company. Although he welcomed any signs of public interest, he also wanted as much empty sky as he could get. After all, he was the first man in history to navigate a ship three-tenths of a mile long.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 So far, t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
his first test flight had gone perfectly; ironically enough, the only problem had been the century-old aircraft carrier Chairman Mao, borrowed from the San Diego Naval Museum for support operations. Only one of Mao\hich\f39 \rquote \loch\f39

s top speed was barely thirty knots. Luckily, wind speed at sea level had been less than half this, so it had not been too difficult to maintain still air on the flight deck. Though there had been a few anxious moments during 
\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 g\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
usts, when the mooring lines had been dropped, the dirigible had risen smoothly, straight up into the sky, as if on an invisible elevator. If all went well, Queen Elizabeth IV would not meet Chairman Mao again for another week.

l, all test instruments gave normal readings. Commander Falcon decided to go upstairs and watch the rendezvous. He handed over to his second officer, and walked out into the transparent tubeway that led through the heart of the ship. There, as always, he 
\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 w\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 as overwhelmed by the spectacle of the largest single space ever enclosed by man.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The ten spherical gas cells, each more than a hundred feet across, were ranged one behind the other like a line of gigantic soap bubbles. The tough plastic was so clear that\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
 he could see through the whole length of the array, and make out details of the elevator mechanism, more than a third of a mile from his vantage point. All around him, like a three-dimensional maze, was the structural framework of the ship the great long
\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 i\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 tudinal girders running from nose to tail, the fifteen hoops that were the circular ribs of this sky-borne colossus, and whose varying sizes defined its graceful, streamlined profile.

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 At this low speed, there was little sound, merely the soft rush of wind\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
 over the envelope and an occasional creak of metal as the pattern of stresses changed. The shadowless light from the rows of lamps far overhead gave the whole scene a curiously submarine quality, and to Falcon this was caused by the spectacle of the tran
\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 s\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
lucent gasbags. He had once encountered a squadron of large but harmless jellyfish, pulsing their mindless way above a shallow tropical reef, and the plastic bubbles that gave Queen Elizabeth her lift often reminded him of these especially when changing p
\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 r\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 essures made them crinkle and scatter new patterns of reflected light.

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He walked down the axis of the ship until he came to the forward elevator, between gas cells one and two. Riding up to the Observation Deck, be noticed that it was uncomfortably hot, a\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The Queen obtained almost a quarter of her buoyancy from the unlimited amounts of waste heat produced by her fusion power plant. On this lightly loaded flight, indeed only six of the ten gas cell
\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
s contained helium, the remaining four were full of air. Yet she still carried two hundred tons of water as ballast. However, running the cells at high temperatures did produce problems in refrigerating the access ways, it was obvious that a little more w

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
A refreshing blast of cooler air hit him in the face when he stepped out onto the Observation Deck and into the dazzling sunlight streaming through the plexiglass roof. Half a dozen workmen, with an equal number of superchi
\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
mp assistants, were busily laying the partly completed dance floor, while others were installing electric wiring and fixing furniture. It was a scene of controlled chaos, and Falcon found it hard to believe that everything would be ready for the maiden vo

\par

ady completed Skylounge. This was his favourite place in the whole ship, and he knew that once she was operating he would never again have it all to himself. He would allow himself just five minutes of private enjoyment.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He called the bridge, checked that\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
 everything was still in order, and relaxed into one of the comfortable swivel chairs. Below, in a curve that delighted the eye, was the unbroken silver sweep of the ship\hich\f39 \rquote \loch\f39

 largest vehicle ever built. And when he had tired of that, all the way out the horizon, was the fantastic wilderness carved by the Colorado River in half a billion years of time.

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Apart from the camera platform (it had now fallen back and was filming irom amidships), he had the sky to himself. It was blue and empty, clear down to the horizon. In his grandfather\hich\f39 \rquote \loch\f39

 the gas cells as it did so. They were still collapsing slowly, in great falling veils of plastic. He was not worried about the loss of lift, the ballast could easily take care of that, as long as eight cells remained intact. Far more serious was the poss

He had almost completed his descent when, with a sound of rending metal, the vessel pitched nose down, and the lights went out. But he could still see quite well, for a shaft of sunlight streamed through the open hatch and the huge tear in th

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 A glance at the display board told him that all the ballast had gone. However, the rate of descent h\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ad been reduced to a few yards a second, they still had a fighting chance.

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Without a word, Falcon eased himself into the pilot\hich\f39 \rquote \loch\f39 s seat and took over such control as still remained. The instrument board showed him every thing he wished to know, speech was
\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Far away, above the sound of straining metal and escaping gas, came the familiar whistle of the jets as Falcon opened up the lateral thrusters. The ship staggered, and began to slew to port. The shri

The fall from Jupiter V to Jupiter itself takes only three and a half hours. Few men could have slept on so awesome a journey. Sleep was a weakness that Howard Falcon hated, and the little he still required brought dreams that time had not yet been able t

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The dreams he feared most always began with his first return to conciousness. There had been little physical pain, in fact, there had been no sensation of any kind. He was in darkness and silenc

The countdown was three seconds late not at all bad, considering the unknowns involved. From beyond the walls of the capsule came a ghostly sighing, which rose steadily to a high-pitched, screaming roar. The noise was quite different from that of a re

There was a sudden jolt as the incandescent renmants of the heat shield was jettisoned. It had done its work and would not be needed again, Jupiter could have it now. He released all but two of the restraining buckles, and waited br

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He did not see the first drogue parachute pop out, but he could feel the slight jerk, and the rate of fall diminished imnediately. Kon-Tiki had lost all its horizontal speed\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
 and was going straight down at almost a thousand mi1es an hour. Everything depended on what happened in the next sixty seconds.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There went the second drogue. He looked up through the overhead window and saw, to his immense relief, that clouds of glitteri\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
ng foil were billowing out behind the falling ship. Like a great flower unfurling, the thousands of cubic yards of the balloon spread out across the sky, scooping p the thin gas until it was fully inflated. Kon-Tiki\hich\f39 \rquote \loch\f39 
s rate of fall dropped to a few miles a\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 n\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  hour and remained constant. Now there was plenty of time, it would take him days to fall all the way down to the surface of Jupiter.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 But he would get there eventually, even if he did nothing about it. The balloon overhead was merely acting as an efficien\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 With its characteristic and rather disconcerting crack the fusion reactor started up, pouring torrents of heat into the envelope overhead. Within five min\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
utes, the rate of fall had become zero; within six, the ship had started to level. According to the radar altimeter, it had levelled out at about two hundred and sixty-seven miles above the surface, or whatever passed for surface on Jupiter.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Only one kind\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Though a whole new world was lying around him, it was more than an hour befo\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 re Falcon could examine the view. First he had to check all the capsule\hich\f39 \rquote \loch\f39 
s systems and test its response to the controls. He had to learn how much extra heat was necessary to produce a desired rate of ascent, and how much gas he must vent in order to desce\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 n\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
d. Above all, there was the question of stability. He must adjust the length of the cables attaching his capsule to the huge, pear-shaped balloon, to damp out vibrations and get the smoothest possible ride. Thus far, he was lucky; at this level, the wind 
\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 w\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
as steady, and the Doppler reading on the invisible surface gave him a ground speed of two hundred and seventeen and a half miles an hour. For Jupiter, that was modest, winds of up to a thousand had been observed.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
But mere speed was, of course, unimportant, the real danger was turbulence. If he ran into that, only skill and experience and swift reaction could save him, and these were not matters that could yet be programmed into a computer.
\par

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 His first impression was unexpected, and even a little disappointing. As far as t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 That layer of clouds apparently about three miles away was really more than thirty-seven miles below. And the horizon, whose distance he would have \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
guessed at about one hundred and twenty-five, was actually eighteen hundred miles from the ship.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The crystalline clarity of the hydrogen-helium atmosphere and the enormous curvature of the planet had fooled him completely. It was even harder to judge dist\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was a simple matter, and he should have been prepared for it. Yet somehow, it disturbed him profoundly. He did not feel that Jupiter was huge, but that he had shrunk to \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
a tenth of his normal size. Perhaps, with time, he would grow accustomed to the inhuman scale of this world, yet as he stared toward that unbelievably distant horizon, he felt as if a wind colder than the atmosphere around him was blowing through his soul
.\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  Despite all his arguments, this might never be a place for man. He could well be both the first and the last to descend through the clouds of Jupiter.

 It was cold up there, on the fringes of space but both pressure and temperature increased rapidly with depth. At the level where Kon-Tiki was drifting now, it was fifty below zero, and the pressure was five atmospheres. Sixty-five miles farther down, it

infrasonic throbbing. Then, suddenly, in mid-vibration, it stopped so abruptly that the mind could not accept the silence, but memory continued to manufacture a ghostly echo in the deepest caverns of the brain.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was the most extraordinary sound that F\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
alcon had ever heard, even among the multitudinous noises of Earth. He could think of no natural phenomenon that could have caused it, nor was it like the cry of any animal, not even one of the great whales....

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It came again, following exactly the same pa\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39

\par 
\par 
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 And this time there was a real echo, very faint and far away. Perhaps it was from one of the man\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Mission Control reacted quickly and asked him to drop another probe at once. With two microphones operating, it would be possible to find the aproximate location of the sources. Oddly enough, none of Kon-Tiki\hich\f39

Yes, that seemed plausible, and probably the physicists would be able to me up with an explanation. What would a blind alien make, Falcon wondered, of the sounds he might hear when standing beside a stormy sea, a geyser, or a volcano, or a waterfall? He

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 About an hour before sunrise the voices of the deep died away, and Falcon began to busy himself with preparation for the dawn of his second day. Kon-Tiki was now only three miles above the nearest cloud layer, t

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Ten minutes later he could see what Mission Control had already observed from its superior vantage point. There was a change in colour near the horizon, and the cloud layer had become ragged and lumpy, as if something 
\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 had torn it open. He turned up his little nuclear furnace and gave Kon-Tiki another three miles of altitude, so that he could get a better view.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The sky below was clearing rapidly, completely, as if something was dissolving the solid overcast. An abyss wa\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39

A new world lay spread beneath him, Jupiter had stripped away one of its many veils. The second layer of clouds, unattainably far below, was much darker in colour than the first. It was almost salmon pink, and curiously mottled with little islands of bric
\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 k\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
 red. They were all oval-shaped, with their long axes pointing east-west, in the direction of the prevailing wind. There were hundreds of them, all about the same size, and they reminded Falcon of puffy little cumulus clouds in the terrestrial sky.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He red\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 uced buoyancy, and Kon-Tiki began to drop down the face of the dissolving cliff. It was then that he noticed the snow.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 White flakes were forming in the air and drifting slowly downward. Yet it was much too warm for snow and, in any event, there was scarce\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
ly a trace of water at this altitude. Moreover, there was no glitter or sparkle about these flakes as they went cascading down into the depths. When, presently, a few landed on an instrument boom outside the main vieWing port, he saw that they were a dull
,\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 About sixty miles ahead, a disturbance was taking place in the cloud layer. The little red ovals were being jostled around, and were beginning to form a spiral the familiar cyclonic pattern so common in the meteorology of 
\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Earth. The vortex was emerging with astonishing speed, if that was a storm ahead, Falcon told himself, he was in big trouble.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 And then his concern changed to wonder and to fear. What was developing in his line of flight was not a storm at all. Something e\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
normous, something scores of miles across was rising through the clouds.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The reassuring thought that it, too, might be a cloud, a thunderhead boiling up from the lower levels of the atmosphere lasted only a few seconds. No, this was solid. It shouldered i\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 An iceberg floating on hydrogen? That was impossible, of course; but perhaps it was not too remote an analogy. As soon as he focused the telescope upon the enigma, Falcon s\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was a disconcerting sight, then Falcon again reminded himself that nothing really solid could possibly hover in t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It did not warn him, however, of the violent cross wind that abruptly grabbed Kon-Tiki and swept it almost at right angles to its previous track. Falcon needed all hi\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
s skill and the maximum use of what little control he had over his ungainly vehicle to prevent it from being capsised. Within minutes he was racing northward at over three hundred miles an hour. Then, as suddenly as it had started, the turbulence ceased,

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The snow storm dissolved, and he saw what Jupiter had been preparing for him. 
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Kon-Tiki had entered the funnel of a gigantic \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Though the vessel was being dragged downward so slowly that it was in no immediate danger, Falcon increased the flow of heat into the envelope until Kon-Tiki hovered at a constant altitude. Not until then
\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  did he abandon the fantastic spectacle outside and consider again the problem of the radar.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The nearest echo was now only about twenty-five miles away. All of them, he quickly realised, were distributed along the wall of the vortex, and were moving with \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
it, apparently caught in the whirlpool like Kofl-Tiki itself.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He aimed the telescope along the radar bearing and found himself looking at a curious mottled cloud that almost filled the field of view. It was not easy to see, being only a little darker than
\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  the whirling wall of mist that formed its background. Not until he had been staring for several minutes did Falcon realise that he had met it once before.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The first time it had been crawling across the drifting mountains of foam, and he had mistaken it f\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
or a giant, many-trunked tree. Now at last he could appreciate its real size and complexity and could give it a better name to fix its image in his mind. It did not resemble a tree at all, but a jellyfish, a medusa, such as might be met trailing its tenta

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 This medusa was more than a mile across and its scores of dangling entacles were hundreds of feet long. They swayed slowly back and forth in perfect unison, taking more than a minute for each co

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The other echoes were more distant medusae. Falcon focused the teleope on half a dozen and could see no variations in shape or size. They all seemed to be of the same s\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
pecies, and he wondered just why they were drifting lazily around in this six-hundred-mile orbit. Perhaps they were dining upon the aerial plankton sucked in by the whirlpool, as Kon-Tiki self had been.

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 I see what you mean,\hich\f39 \rquote \loch\f39  Brenner answered, a little reluctantly. \hich\f39 \lquote \loch\f39 Let\hich\f39 \rquote \loch\f39 s stay where we a\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 re for the present.

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Which category was the medusa? That was a question he could hardly try to have answered in the short time that was left to him. Yet just before noon, without the slightest warning, the answer came...
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Like a \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
squadron of antique jet fighters, five mantas came sweeping through the wall of mist that formed the funnel of the vortex. They were flying in a V formation directly toward the pallid grey cloud of the medusa, and there was no doubt, in Falcon\hich\f39 
\rquote \loch\f39 s mind, tha\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 t\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  they were on the attack. He had been quite wrong to assume that they were harmless vegetarians.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Yet everything happened at such a leisurely pace that it was like watching a slow-motion film. The mantas undulated along at perhaps thirty miles an hour, it \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
seemed ages before they reached the medusa, which continued to paddle imperturbably along at an even slower speed. Huge though they were, the mantas looked tiny beside the monster they were approaching. When they flapped down on its back, they appeared ab
\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 o\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ut as large as birds landing on a whale.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Could the medusa defend itself, Falcon wondered. He did not see how the attacking mantas could be in danger as long as they avoided those huge clumsy tentacles. And perhaps their host was not even aware of them, th
\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ey could be insignificant parasites, tolerated as are fleas upon a dog.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 But now it was obvious that the medusa was in distress. With agonising slowness, it began to tip over like a capsising ship. After ten minutes it had tilted forty-five degrees, it was\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
 also rapidly losing altitude. It was impossible not to feel a sense of pity for the beleaguered monster, and to Falcon the sight brought bitter memories. In a grotesque way, the fall of the medusa was almost a parody of the dying Queen\hich\f39 \rquote 
\loch\f39 s last moments.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Ye\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Then he noticed that the medusa\hich\f39 \rquote \loch\f39 s tactics seemed to be having some effect. The mantas had been disturbed by its slow roll and were flapping heavily away from its back, like gorg
\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 ed vultures interrupted at mealtime. But they did not move very far, continuing to hover a few yards from the still-capsising monster.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There was a sudden, blinding flash of light synchronised with a crash of static over the radio. One of the mantas, slowl\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 In unison, the remaining mantas dived steeply away from the medusa, gai\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 There was a long silence while everyone on the radio circuit absorbed the implications of this. For the first\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 It was growing darker, but Falcon scarcely noticed as he strained his eyes toward that living cloud in the field of the telescope. The wind that was steadily sweeping Kon-Tiki around the funnel of th
\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 e great whirlpool had now brought him within twelve miles of the creature. If he got much closer than six, he would take evasive action. Though he felt certain that the medusa\hich\f39 \rquote \loch\f39

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Now it was quite dark in the capsule. That was strange, because sunset was still hours away. Automatically, he glanced at the horizontally scanning radar, as he had done every few\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
 minutes. Apart from the medusa the was studying, there was no other object within about sixty miles of him.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Suddenly, with startling power, he heard the sound that had come booming out of the Jovian night, the throbbing beat that grew more and more rapid\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
, then stopped in mid-crescendo. The whole capsule vibrated with it like a pea in a kettledrum.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Falcon realised two things almost simultaneously during the sudden, aching silence. This time the sound was not coming from thousands of miles away, over a rad\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 
io circuit. It was in the very atmosphere around him.
\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The second thought was even more disturbing. He had quite forgotten, it was inexcusable, but there had been other apparently more important things on his mind, that most of the sky above him was comple

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He had known this, of course, it had been a minor defect of the design, tolerated because it did not\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 He heard Brenner yelling: \hich\f39 \lquote \loch\f39 Remember the Prime directive! Don\hich\f39 \rquote \loch\f39 t alarm it!\hich\f39 \rquote \loch\f39  \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39

Falcon had a momentary glimpse of great tentacles whipping upward and away. He had just time to note that they were studded with large bladders or sacs, presumably to give them buoyancy, and that they ended in a multitude of
\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39  thin feelers like the roots of a plant. He half expected a bolt of lightning but nothing happened.

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Then, to his great relief, he saw that the medusa was levelling off, not quite a mile above him. Perhaps it had decided to approach this stran\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39

And then Falcon saw something that made him even more unhappy. The medusa was still hovering about a mile above him, but one of its tentacles was becoming incredibly elongated, and was stretching down toward Kon Tiki, thinning out at the same time. As a b

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 The thin tip of the tentacle came slithering around the edge of the balloon some sixty yards away. It was about the size of an elephant\hich\f39 \rquote \loch\f39 s trunk, a\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39

\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 This seemed about as good a time as any. He gave a swift scan of the entire control board, started the final four-second ignition count, broke the safety seal, and pressed the JETTISON switch.

A roaring column of hot hydrohelium was pouring out of the reactor nozzles, swiftly building up thrust, but toward Jupiter, not away from it. He could not pull out yet, for vector control was too sluggish. Unless he could gain complete

\par 
\par \hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39 Falcon was confident that the ramjet would steadily give him velocity and altitude until he had reached near-orbital speed at the fringes of the atmosphere. Then, with a brie\hich\af39\dbch\af31505\loch\f39
