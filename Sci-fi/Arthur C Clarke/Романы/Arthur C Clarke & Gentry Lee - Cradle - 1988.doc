THE emerald water smashes against the dark volcanic cliffs.  Fine white spray \par
hovers over the harsh rock creating a misty veil that glimmers in the fading \par
light.  In the distance, two yellow suns set simultaneously, separated by about \par
forty degrees as they disappear together below the horizon.  Across the blue-\par
black sky, on the opposite side of the isthmus that slopes gently downward from \par
the volcanic cliffs to another ocean, a pair of full moons rise as the two suns \par
vanish.  Their twin moonlight, although much weaker than the shine of the \par
disappearing suns, is still strong enough to create dancing moon shadows on the \par
ocean beneath the rocky overhang.\par
\tab As the dual moons rise on the eastern side of the isthmus, light begins to \par
glow on the horizon beside them, about twenty degrees to the south.  At first \par
the glow looks like the light of a distant city, but with each passing moment it \par
brightens until it spreads across the sky.  At length an awesome third moon, its \par
first chord coming over the horizon when the twin moons are maybe ten degrees \par
into their arc, begins to rise.  Calm descends on both oceans for a few seconds, \par
as if the world beneath the giant orb has paused to give homage to the \par
spectacular sight.  This great yellow moon, its face clearly scarred by craters, \par
appears to be surveying its dominion as it slowly rises in the sky and bathes \par
the emerald oceans in a mysterious reflected light.  It is a hundred times the \par
size of the smaller twin moons and its wide swath through the sky is greater in \par
size than that cut minutes before by the pair of setting suns\par
\tab Below the cliffs, in the shadow of the newest moon, a long sinuous object \par
arcs its way out of the water, rising nearly twenty feet above the surface.  The \par
slender apparition twists itself toward the cliffs and thrusts itself forward as \par
the piercing sound of a trumpet, a solo blast, reverberates against the rocks \par
and carries across the isthmus.  A moment later another sound is heard, a muted \par
echo or possibly a reply from the other sea.  The creature swims gracefully into \par
the moonlight, its long, lithe neck a cobalt blue above a gray body mostly \par
submerged in the ocean.  Now the bluenecked serpent extends itself upward again \par
and leans toward the land, its face revealed in the expanding moonlight.  The \par
facial features are convoluted and complex, with rows of orifices of unknown \par
purpose.  At the peak of its extension, the creature contorts its face and a \par
medley of sounds is heard; the trumpet blast is now accompanied by an oboe and \par
an organ.  After a short pause a muted response, quieter but with the same rich \par
complexity of sound, comes back across the isthmus.\par
\tab The serpent swims north along the shore.  Behind it in the moonlight half \par
a dozen other swirling necks rise from the ocean.  These creatures are a little \par
smaller, the hues of their cobalt necks not quite so vivid.  This ensemble turns \par
as one, on cue, and blasts six trumpet calls to the east.  Again a pause \par
precedes the expected response, the sound of several smaller trumpets from \par
across the land.  Immediately the six new creatures and their distant friends \par
begin a complex, interleaved musical pattern, slowly building in intensity until \par
the overture reaches an inevitable crescendo and then abruptly abates.\par
\tab After a few moments more the oceans on both sides of the isthmus become \par
alive with teeming serpents of all sizes.  Hundreds, even thousands, of \par
serpents, covering the water for as far as the eye can see, begin languorously \par
extending their necks, twisting as if looking around, and joining in the \par
singing.  The serpents of the eastern sea are slightly smaller than their \par
western cousins.  The necks of the eastern serpents are pale blue instead of \par
cobalt.  These pale blue serpents are also joined by a nursery of tiny \par
creatures, the palest of blue markings on their necks, whose singing is high-\par
pitched and a trifle erratic and sounds like piccolos interspersed with crystal \par
bells.\par
\tab The waters of the emerald oceans begin to surge forward in tidal frenzy, \par
now rapidly moving up the rocky cliffs on the western side and quickly \par
submerging great chunks of land on the sloping side that runs to the eastern \par
ocean.  The concerted pull of all the moons produces a tide that will eventually \par
cover the isthmus completely, uniting the two oceans.  As the waters draw ever \par
closer together, the music from the thousand singing serpents swells to \par
magnificence, flooding the entire area with a sound of mesmerizing beauty.  It \par
is also a plaintive sound of longing and anticipation, the universal cry of \par
long-suppressed desire on the verge of being satisfied.\par
\tab The great longnecked serpents of Canthor conclude their annual mating \par
symphony as the two oceans become one and the inhabitants of each ocean seek out \par
their lifelong mates in the united waters.  There are five nights out of each \par
Canthorean year when the tidal forces act together to submerge the isthmus and \par
permit the sexual mixing of the serpents.  Five nights of love play and \par
frolicking, of renewal and promise, before the requisite return to the separate \par
oceans and a year of waiting for the great tide to come again.\par
\tab For the little ones, the new serpents placed into gestation by the last \par
annual gathering and hatched by their mothers in the eastern ocean, the great \par
tide is a time of excitement and sadness.  They must now separate from their \par
playmates, leave their infancy behind.  Half must depart from their mothers as \par
well and go to swim among the cobalt blue adults that they have never met.  This \par
half, having lived their lives among their mothers' friends exclusively, will \par
swim above and across the isthmus on the fifth night alongside their fathers.  \par
Once into the western ocean, their pale blue necks will begin to deepen in color \par
as they begin the transition through puberty into adulthood.  And next year, \par
their tiny voices will have matured just enough that each of them may detect \par
some arousing and positive response to his call during the mating symphony\par
\par
\tab Thousands of years pass on the planet Canthor.  The forces of change \par
conspire against the beautiful bluenecked serpents.  First a major ice age comes \par
to the world, locking up more of the planet's water in perennial polar caps and \par
lowering the seas.  The number of days that the great tide submerges the isthmus \par
is reduced to four, then three, and finally only two.  The elaborate mating \par
ritual of the serpents, worked out over hundreds of generations, works best for \par
a five-night courtship.  For the several hundred years that only two nights are \par
available for mating, the number of serpent offspring produced each year drops \par
precipitously.  The total number of Canthorean serpents becomes dangerously \par
small.\par
\tab At length the radiative output of the dual suns increases slightly again \par
and Canthor emerges from its ice age.  The sea level rises and the number of \par
days for mating returns eventually to five.  The serpent symphony, which had \par
added a saddened counterpoint during the trying years of reduced mating nights, \par
again becomes charged with joy.  For several generations the number of serpents \par
increases.  But then the lovely creatures encounter another foe.\par
\tab Evolving elsewhere on Canthor for almost a million years has been another \par
intelligent species, a fierce, squat creature with an insatiable appetite for \par
control.  The ice age stimulated the rapid evolution of these trolls by \par
enforcing a strict survival of the fittest that naturally selected those \par
individuals with the most resources (intelligence and power primarily) and, in a \par
sense, purified the troll gene pool.\par
\tab The troll species that emerges from the thousands of years of ice \par
domination on Canthor is sharper and more capable of dealing with the rest of \par
its environment.  It has become a tool maker and has learned how to use the \par
riches of the planet for its benefit.  No other living creatures on Canthor can \par
match the cleverness of the trolls or threaten their existence.  So the trolls \par
proliferate around the planet, dominating it completely with their \par
rapaciousness.\par
\tab The bluenecked serpents have had no natural enemies on Canthor for \par
hundreds of millennia.  Therefore they have not retained the aggression and \par
territoriality necessary to survive when threatened.  Their diet has always \par
consisted primarily of plants and animals that fill the Canthorean oceans.  The \par
seas provide a virtual cornucopia of food, so it does not make much of an \par
impression upon the serpents when the trolls begin to farm the oceans for their \par
own food.  To the trolls, however, whose greed for territory knows no bounds, \par
the serpents represent at least a rival for the plenty of the oceans and \par
possibly, because of their size and intelligence, even a survival threat.\par
\par
\tab It is again the time of the great tide and the male longnecked serpents \par
have completed their ocean migration on time, swarming as usual just opposite \par
the great volcanic cliffs.  There are only a few hundred male serpents now, down \par
markedly from the halcyon years when they were so numerous they stretched as far \par
as the eye could see.  The giant full moon rises as it has for thousands of \par
years, following the twin smaller moons into the sky, and the overture announces \par
the coming mating symphony.  But as the tide rolls in to submerge the isthmus, \par
the serpents sense that something is wrong.  A growing cacophony creeps into the \par
mystical mating song.  Anxiety spreads by sound across both sides of the land \par
separating the serpents.  When the tide finally surges over the top of the \par
volcanic rocks, the point in the original mating symphony for the magnificent \par
final crescendo, the sound of the serpents' pleading wail fills the Canthorean \par
night.\par
\tab The trolls have erected a huge barrier down the spine of the isthmus.  \par
Carefully calculated to be just tall enough to preclude passage to the largest \par
of the serpents, this oppressive barrier allows the lovely bluenecked creatures, \par
if they strain, to sense one another at close range but not to touch.  The \par
nights of the great tide are extremely painful to watch.  From both sides the \par
serpents hurl themselves repeatedly and ineffectually at the wall, trying \par
desperately to make contact with their mates.  But it is all in vain.  The \par
barrier holds.  The serpents are unable to mate.  Both sexes return eventually \par
to their respective oceans, deeply saddened and profoundly aware of the \par
implications of the barrier for their future.\par
\tab Some of the serpents batter themselves nearly senseless as they try to \par
break down the wall.  These wounded ones on both sides of the isthmus remain \par
behind to recover while the rest of the species, resuming the annual migration \par
as if the normal mating had indeed taken place, slowly and sadly swim away, each \par
sex heading for a separate reach of Canthor.\par
\tab It is two nights after the great tide has stopped submerging the land \par
between the oceans.  Two older male serpents, their necks still bruised from the \par
repeated bootless hammerings against the hated barrier, are swimming slowly \par
together in the moonlight.  A strange light in the sky comes swiftly upon them \par
from above.  It hovers over the serpents, seeming to spotlight them as they \par
crane their necks to see what is happening.\par
\tab In a moment the graceful necks keel forward and slap down upon the moonlit \par
ocean.  From out of the light above them comes an object, a basket of some kind, \par
that descends to the water.  The two serpents are scooped up, lifted silently \par
out of the sea into the air, reeled in by some unknown fisherman in the sky \par
above them.  The same scene repeats a dozen times, first in the western ocean \par
with the wounded serpents whose necks are cobalt blue, then in the eastern ocean \par
with their pale blue counterparts.  It is as if a great roundup is taking place, \par
removing all the exhausted serpents who had been unable to take their place with \par
the rest of the species in the annual migration.\par
\tab Far above Canthor a gigantic cylindrical spaceship awaits the return of \par
its robot minions.  Twenty miles on a side, this traveling planet opens itself \par
to a fleet of returning vehicles the size of large airplanes that bring back the \par
quarry from Canthor.  The cylinder rotates slowly as Canthor and its giant moon \par
shine in the background.  A solo laggard vehicle returns a door opens to receive \par
it in the back of the larger craft, and for a while there is no more activity.  \par
At length the cylinder tips over on its side and fires several small rockets.  \par
It is out of sight in seconds, departing Canthor for other worlds.\par
\par
\tab The snow falls steadily on the huge man trudging silently through the \par
forest.  Clad in skins, carrying a heavy load on his back and a large spear in \par
one hand, he turns his hairy, unkempt face toward the others behind him, his \par
family, and grunts at them to hurry.  There are five altogether, an infant \par
carried by the woman and two teenage children.  The teenagers are wearing skins \par
like their parents and have large bundles slung across their backs.  The teenage \par
boy is also carrying a spear.  At close distance all of them look very weary, \par
almost exhausted.\par
\tab They break free from the forest for a moment and enter a meadow that \par
surrounds a frozen pond.  The snow continues to fall, adding to the three inches \par
that already cover the ground.  The father motions to his family to stop and \par
approaches the pond gingerly.  As the others huddle together against the cold, \par
the man takes a crude tool from his bundle and, after brushing the snow off the \par
surface of the pond in a small area, begins to cut the ice.  Almost an hour \par
passes.  Finally he succeeds, utters a grunt of happiness, and bends down to \par
drink the water.  He pulls out a skin, fills it, and brings the water to his \par
wife and children.\par
\tab The teenage daughter smiles at her father, a smile of love and admiration, \par
as he offers her the water.  Her face is tired, etched with the lines of sun and \par
wind and cold.  She reaches up to take the skin.  Suddenly her face contorts \par
with fear, she screams, and her father turns just in time to protect himself \par
from a snarling wolf, midair in an attack.  He strikes the wolf full force with \par
his powerful arm, knocking it away from its target, and then stumbles toward his \par
spear on the ground beside the pond.  He grabs the spear and turns around \par
quickly, prepared to defend his family.\par
\tab Three wolves have attacked them.  His son has deftly impaled one of the \par
wolves through the midriff with his spear, but now a second wolf has pinioned \par
the boy, defenseless in the snow, before he has been able to withdraw his weapon \par
and strike again.  In a frenzy, the father jumps forward and thrusts his spear \par
into the wolf attacking his son.  But it is too late.  The hungry wolf had \par
already found the boy's throat, severing the jugular vein with one quick snap of \par
his powerful jaws.\par
\tab Whirling around, the caveman moves against the last of the wolves.  His \par
wife lies bleeding in the snow and his infant child is unprotected, screaming in \par
its wrappings some twenty feet from the mother.  The last wolf, wary of the huge \par
man, feints an attack against the father and then leaps for the baby.  Before \par
the man can respond, the wolf has grabbed the baby by its clothes and headed off \par
for the forest.\par
\tab The young girl was spared physical injury in the attack but was devastated \par
by the near instant death of her brother and the disappearance of her tiny \par
sister.  She holds her dead brother's hand and sobs uncontrollably.  The father \par
stuffs virgin snow in the wife's wounds and then lifts her upon his back along \par
with the heavy bundles.  He grunts a couple of times to his daughter and she \par
finally, reluctantly, picks herself up and starts gathering what remains of the \par
family's things into another bundle.\par
\tab As night falls the three surviving members of the family are approaching \par
some caves at the edge of the forest.  The father is near exhaustion from the \par
weight of his wife and the family's meager belongings.  He sits down to rest for \par
a moment.  His daughter stumbles down beside him, placing her head in his lap.  \par
She cries silently and her father tenderly wipes away her tears.  A bright light \par
suddenly shines down on them from above and an instant later all three are \par
unconscious.\par
\tab A tethered metallic basket about fifteen feet long and five feet wide \par
descends in the eerie snowy light and comes to rest softly on the ground beside \par
the three humans.  The sides of the basket drop and metal belts extend \par
themselves outward, wrapping around each of the people.  They are pulled into \par
the basket, the sides of the basket are closed, and the strange object then \par
ascends into the snowy night.  Seconds later the spotlight disappears and life \par
returns to normal in the prehistoric forest.\par
\tab Above the Earth the giant cylinder sits quietly, waiting for its \par
messengers to return.  The planet below is nearly cloudless and the great blue \par
stretches of ocean tremble like jewels in the reflected sunlight.  Near the \par
evening terminator, the low sun angles show a vast expanse of ice extending down \par
from the North Pole, covering almost all of a large continent.  To the west, \par
across a great ocean and an all white northern island, the midday sun shines on \par
another large continent.  It is also mostly covered by ice.  Here the ice \par
extends southward across two thirds of the land mass and only disappears \par
completely as the continent begins to taper and the southern sea is reached.\par
\tab The hunting shuttles sent out from the great cylinder return to their base \par
and unload their prey.  The father, injured mother, and teenage daughter are \par
inside the small shuttle craft along with fifty to sixty other humans, obviously \par
selected from disparate points around the world.  None of the humans is moving.  \par
After the shuttle safely docks with the mother ship, all the prehistoric humans \par
are moved in a large van to a receiving station.  Here they are admitted and \par
catalogued, and then taken inside a vast module that re-creates the environment \par
of Earth.\par
\tab Far above the Earth, the last of the drone scouts returns to the giant \par
cylinder.  There is a momentary pause, as if some unknown checklist were being \par
verified, and then the cylindrical space vehicle disappears.\par

THURSDAY\par

\par
THEY were there on the beach at sunrise.  Sometime during the night seven whales \par
had run aground at Deer Key, five miles east of Key West.  The powerful \par
leviathans of the deep, ten to fifteen feet long, looked helpless as they lay \par
floundering on the sand.  Another half dozen members of this misguided pod of \par
false killer whales were swimming in circles in the shallow lagoon just off the \par
beach, obviously lost and confused.\par
\tab By seven o'clock on the clear March morning, whale experts from Key West \par
had arrived and were already beginning to coordinate what would later become a \par
concerted effort by local fishermen and boating enthusiasts to push the beached \par
animals back into the lagoon.  Once the whales were off the beach, the next task \par
would be to coax the entire pod into the Gulf of Mexico.  There was little or no \par
chance that the animals would survive unless they could be returned to open \par
water.\par
\tab Carol Dawson was the first reporter to arrive.  She parked her sporty new \par
Korean station wagon on the shoulder of the road, just off the beach, and jumped \par
out to analyze the situation.  The beach and lagoon at Deer Key formed a cove \par
that was shaped like a half moon.  An imaginary cord connecting the two points \par
of land at the ends of the cove would extend almost half a mile across the \par
water.  Outside the cord was the Gulf of Mexico.  The seven whales had \par
penetrated the cove in the center and were beached at the point farthest from \par
the open sea.  They were about thirty feet apart and maybe twenty-five feet up \par
on the sand.  The rest of the whales were trapped in the shallows no more than a \par
hundred feet offshore.\par
\tab Carol walked around to the back of her station wagon.  Before pulling out \par
a large photographic case, she stopped to adjust the strings on her pants.  (She \par
had dressed quickly this morning when awakened in her Key West hotel room by the \par
call from Miami.  Her exercise sweat suit was hardly her usual working attire.  \par
The sweats hid the assets of a shapely, finely tuned body that looked more like \par
twenty than thirty.)  Inside the case was a collection of cameras, both still \par
and video.  She selected three of the cameras, popped a couple of M & Ms from an \par
old package into her mouth, and approached the beach.  As she walked across the \par
sand toward the people and the beached whales, Carol stopped occasionally to \par
photograph the scene.\par
\tab Carol first approached a man wearing a uniform from the South Florida \par
Marine Research Center.  He was facing the ocean and talking to two Naval \par
officers from the Marine Patrol section of the U.S.  Naval Air Station in Key \par
West.  A dozen or so local volunteers were in close orbit around the speakers, \par
keeping their distance but listening intently to the discussion.  Carol walked \par
up to the man from the research center and took him by the arm.\par
\tab "Good morning, Jeff," she said.\par
\tab He turned to look at her.  After a moment a vague smile of recognition \par
crossed his face.\par
\tab "Carol Dawson, Miami Herald," she said quickly.  "We met one night at MOI.  \par
I was with Dale Michaels."\par
\tab "Sure, I remember you," he said.  "How could I forget a gorgeous face like \par
yours?"  After a moment he continued, "But what are you doing here?  As far as I \par
know, nobody in the world knew these whales were here until an hour ago.  And \par
Miami is over a hundred miles away."\par
\tab Carol laughed, her eyes politely acknowledging and thanking Jeff for the \par
compliment.  She still didn't like it but had grudgingly grown to accept the \par
fact that people, men especially, remembered her for her looks.\par
\tab "I was already in Key West on another story, Dale called me this morning \par
as soon as he heard about the whales.  Can I interrupt you for just a minute and \par
get some expert comments?  For the record, of course."\par
\tab As she was speaking, Carol reached down and picked up a video camera, one \par
of the newest models, a 1993 SONY about the size of a small notebook, and began \par
interviewing Dr. Jeff Marsden, "the leading authority on whales in the Florida \par
Keys."  The interview was standard stuff, of course, and Carol could have \par
herself supplied all the answers.  But Ms.  Dawson was a good reporter and knew \par
the value of an expert in situations like this.\par
\tab Dr. Marsden explained that marine biologists still did not understand the \par
reasons for whale beachings, although their increased frequency in the late \par
eighties and early nineties had provided ample opportunities for research.  \par
According to him, most experts blamed the beachings on infestations of parasites \par
in the individual whales leading each of the unfortunate pods.  The prevailing \par
theory suggests that these parasites confuse the intricate navigation systems \par
telling the whales where to go.  In other words, the lead whale somehow thinks \par
his migration path is onto the beach and across the land; the others follow \par
because of the rigorous hierarchy in the pod.\par
\tab "I've heard some people say, Dr. Marsden, that the increase in whale \par
beachings is due to us and our pollution.  Would you care to comment on the \par
accusation that our wastes as well as our acoustic and electronic pollution have \par
undermined the sensitive biosystems that the whales use to navigate?"\par
\tab Carol used the zoom on her tiny video camera to record the furrowing of \par
Jeff Marsden's brow.  He was clearly not expecting such a leading question from \par
her this early in the morning.\par
\tab After thinking for a moment, he answered.  "There have been several \par
attempts to explain why there are so many more beachings now than were recorded \par
in the past.  Most researchers come to the inescapable conclusion that something \par
in the whales' environment has changed in the last half-century.  It is not too \par
farfetched to imagine that we may well have been responsible for the changes."\par
\tab Carol knew she had the right quotes for a perfect short piece for \par
television.  She then quickly and professionally wrapped up the interview, \par
thanked Dr. Marsden, and walked over to the onlookers.  In a minute she had \par
plenty of volunteers to take her out into the lagoon so that she could take some \par
close-up photographs of the confused whales.  Within five minutes not only had \par
Carol finished several discs of still photographs, but she also had rigged up \par
her video camera with a stabilizing tripod on one of the little boats and done a \par
video clip of herself explaining the beachings.\par
\tab Before leaving the beach at Deer Key, Carol Dawson opened up the back of \par
her station wagon.  It served her well as a portable photo laboratory.  She \par
first rewound and checked the video tape that she had taken, listening \par
particularly to hear if the splashing of the whales could be heard behind her \par
while she was in the boat.  Then she popped the discs from the still cameras \par
into readers to see if she liked all the photographs.  They were good.  She \par
smiled to herself, closed the back of the station wagon, and drove back to Key \par
West.\par
\par
\par

\par
CAROL finished the redundant transfer of the videotape through the modem to Joey \par
Hernandez in Miami and then called another number.  She was sitting in one of \par
the private cubicles inside the large new communications room at the Key West \par
Marriott.  The screen in front of Carol indicated that the connection for her \par
new number had been made, but there was not yet any picture.  She heard a \par
woman's voice say, "Good morning, Dr. Michaels' office."\par
\tab "Good morning, Bernice, it's Carol.  I'm on video."\par
\tab The monitor cleared up in a second and a pleasant middle-aged woman \par
appeared.  "Oh, hi, Carol.  I'll tell Dale you're on the line."\par
\tab Carol smiled as she watched Bernice swivel her chair and roll over to a \par
panel of buttons on her left.  Bernice was almost surrounded by her desk.  In \par
front of her were a couple of keyboards connected to two large screens, a \par
variety of disc drives, and what looked like a phone embedded in another \par
monitor.  Apparently there had been no room for the communications panel right \par
next to the phone, so Bernice had to roll three to four feet in her chair to \par
signal to Dr. Dale Michaels that he had a call, that it was on video, that it \par
was Carol, and that it was coming from Key West.  Dr. Dale, as he was known by \par
everyone except Carol, liked to have plenty of information before he answered \par
the phone.\par
\tab Both to Bernice's left and right were perpendicular extensions to the \par
desk, upon which were arrayed stacks of floppy discs of different sizes (the \par
stacks were labeled "read" or "file" or "outgoing correspondence"), interleaved \par
with groups of magazines and manila folders containing hard copy printout from \par
the computers.  Bernice pushed a button on the panel but nothing happened.  She \par
looked apologetically at Carol on the screen above the phone.\par
\tab "I'm sorry, Carol."  Bernice was a little flustered.  "Maybe I didn't do \par
it right.  Dr. Dale had a new system installed this week again and I'm not \par
certain .  .  ."\par
\tab One of the two large monitors flashed a message.  "Oh good," Bernice \par
continued, now smiling, "I did it right.  He'll be with you in a minute.  He has \par
someone in there with him and will finish quickly so he can see you and speak \par
with you.  I hope you don't mind if I put you on hold."\par
\tab Carol nodded and Bernice's image faded away from the screen.  On the \par
monitor Carol now watched the beginning of a short tutorial documentary on \par
oyster farming.  The piece was beautifully filmed underwater using the most \par
advanced photographic equipment.  The narration featured the mellifluous voice \par
of Dr. Dale and the video pointed out the connection between the inventions at \par
MOI (the Miami Oceanographic Institute, of which Dr. Dale Michaels was the \par
founder and chief executive officer) and the rapid rise of sea farming of all \par
kinds.  But Carol had to laugh.  Playing quietly behind the narration, and \par
increasing in volume during periods of narrative silence, was Pachelbel's \par
"Canon."  It was Dale's favorite piece of mood music (he was so predictable \emdash  \par
Carol always knew what was coming next when Dale put Pachelbel on the CD player \par
in his apartment), but it seemed strange to her to listen to the lilting strings \par
as the cameras moved in for close-ups of growing oysters.\par
\tab The oyster story was abruptly discontinued in medias res and the screen \par
dissolved to the interior of a large executive office.  Dale Michaels was \par
sitting on a couch, across the room from his modem desk, looking at one of three \par
video monitors that could be seen in the room.  "Good morning again, Carol," he \par
said enthusiastically.  "So how did it go?  And where are you?  I didn't know \par
that they had videos in the Marriott rooms yet."\par
\tab Dr. Michaels was tall and slim.  Blond, his hair was slightly curly and \par
receding just a trace at the temples.  He flashed a ready smile that was too \par
quick, almost practiced, but his green eyes were warm and open.\par
\tab "I'm down in the comm room here at the hotel," Carol answered.  "I just \par
sent the whale beaching story off to the Herald on disc.  Jesus, Dale, I felt so \par
sorry for those poor animals.  How can they be so smart and still get their \par
directions so fouled up?"\par
\tab "We don't know, Carol," Dale replied.  "But remember that our definition \par
of intelligence and the whales' definition are almost certainly completely \par
different.  Besides, it's not that surprising that they trust their internal \par
navigation system even when it leads them to disaster.  Can you imagine a \par
situation in which you would essentially disregard information that your eyes \par
were giving you?  It's the same thing.  We're talking here about a malfunction \par
in their primary sensor."\par
\tab Carol was quiet for a moment.  "I guess I can see what you're saying," she \par
said finally, "but it hurt to see them so helpless.  Oh, well, anyway, I got the \par
story on video too.  Incidentally, the new integrated video technology is \par
superb.  The Marriott here just installed a new higher data rate modem for video \par
and I was able to transfer the entire eight-minute piece to Joey Hernandez at \par
Channel 44 in only two minutes.  He loved it.  He does the noon news, you know.  \par
Catch it if you can and tell me what you think."\par
\tab Carol paused just a beat.  "And by the way, Dale, thanks again for the \par
tip."\par
\tab "Just glad to help."  Dale was beaming.  He loved it when he could help \par
Carol with her career.  He had been pursuing her single-mindedly, in his left \par
brain scientific way, for almost a year and a half.  But he had been unable to \par
convince her that a permanent relationship would be mutually beneficial.  Or at \par
least he thought that was the problem.\par
\tab "I think this whale thing could be a great cover," Carol was saying.  "You \par
know I was worried about attracting too much attention with your telescope.  And \par
the treasure hunter bit just doesn't fit if someone down here recognizes me.  \par
But I think I can use a whale follow-up story as the pretense.  What do you \par
think?"\par
\tab "Sounds reasonable to me," Dale answered.  "Incidentally, there have been \par
a couple of other whale irregularities reported as well this morning \emdash  a partial \par
pod beaching up at Sanibel and a supposed attack on a fishing boat north of \par
Marathon.  The owner was Vietnamese and highly excitable.  Of course it's almost \par
unheard of that false killers attack anything related to humans.  But maybe you \par
can use the whole thing somehow."\par
\tab Carol saw that he was already up from the couch and walking around his \par
office.  Dr. Dale Michaels had so much energy it was almost impossible for him \par
to sit still or relax.  He was just a few months away from his fortieth birthday \par
but he still had the zest and enthusiasm of a teenager.\par
\tab "Just try not to let anyone from the Navy know that you have the \par
telescope," he continued.  "They called again this morning and asked for a third \par
set of equipment.  I told them the third telescope was loaned out and being used \par
for research.  Whatever it is that they're looking for must be very important."  \par
He turned and looked at the camera.  "And very secret.  This guy Lieutenant Todd \par
reminded me again this morning, as soon as I made a normal scientific inquiry, \par
that it was Navy business and he couldn't tell me anything about it."\par
\tab Carol made some notes on a small spiral pad.  "You know, Dale," she began \par
again, "I thought this story had tremendous potential as soon as you mentioned \par
it to me yesterday.  Everything indicates that something unusual and secret is \par
going on with the Navy.  I myself was amused by the amateur way that Todd \par
stonewalled me on the phone yesterday and then demanded to know who had given me \par
his name.  I told him that a source in the Pentagon had suggested that there was \par
some high-priority activity at the Naval Air Station in Key West and that he, \par
Todd, was associated with it.  He seemed to buy it.  And I'm convinced that the \par
bozo Navy public affairs guy here knows nothing at all about anything that might \par
be happening."\par
\tab Carol yawned and quickly put her hand over her mouth.  "Well, it's too \par
late to go back to bed.  I guess I'll exercise and then go find that boat we \par
talked about.  I feel as if I'm looking for a needle in a haystack, but your \par
guess could be right.  Anyway, I'll start with the map you gave me.  And if they \par
really have lost a cruise missile somewhere down here and are trying to cover it \par
up, it would certainly be a great scoop for me.  Talk to you later."\par
\tab Dale waved good-bye and hung up.  Carol left the communications area and \par
walked out to the end of the hotel.  She had an oceanfront room on the first \par
floor.  The Herald wouldn't pay for that kind of luxury, but she had decided to \par
splurge anyway this time and pamper herself.  As she was changing into her skin-\par
tight workout swimsuit, she mused to herself about her conversation with Dale.  \par
Nobody would ever know, she thought, that Dale and I are lovers.  Or at least \par
sex partners It's all so businesslike.  As if we're teammates or something.  No \par
darlings or dears.  She paused for a moment and then completed her thought.  Did \par
I make it that way?  she wondered.\par
\tab It was almost nine o'clock and the resort was in the process of waking up \par
when Carol walked out of her room and onto the hotel grounds.  On the beach, the \par
staff had just arrived and were setting out the chaises and umbrellas on the \par
sand for the early risers.  Carol walked over to the young man in charge (a \par
typical Charlie Terrific, Carol thought sarcastically as she watched him strut \par
along in front of his concession shack) and informed him that she was going for \par
a long exercise swim.  Twice at hotels previously she had forgotten to tell the \par
guardians of the beach that she was going to swim a half mile away from the \par
shore.  Both times she had been "rescued," much to her dismay, and had created \par
an untoward scene.\par
\tab As Carol worked into the rhythm of her freestyle stroke, she began to feel \par
the release of tension, the loosening of the knots that bound her most of the \par
time.  Although she told most other people that she exercised regularly to stay \par
fit, the real reason Carol spent at least forty-five minutes each morning \par
running, swimming, or walking briskly was that she needed the exercise to deal \par
with her fast-paced life.  Only after hard exercise could she really feel calm \par
and at peace with her world.\par
\tab It was normal for Carol to let her mind drift idly from subject to subject \par
while she was swimming long distances.  This morning she remembered swimming \par
long ago in the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean near Laguna Beach in \par
California.  Carol had been eight years old at the time and had gone to a \par
birthday party given by a friend, Jessica was her name, whom Carol had met at \par
soccer camp during the summer.  Jessica was rich.  Her house had cost more than \par
a million dollars and Jessica had more toys and dolls than Carol could possibly \par
imagine.\par
\tab Hmm, Carol was thinking as she recalled Jessica's party and the clowns and \par
the ponies.  That was when I still believed in fairy tales.  That was before the \par
separation and divorce  .  .  .\par
\par
\tab Her watch alarm sounded, breaking her reverie, and Carol turned around in \par
the water and headed back to shore.  As she did so, she saw something strange \par
out of the corner of her eye.  No more than twenty yards from her a great whale \par
broke the water, sending chills down her spine and adrenaline rushing into her \par
system.  The whale disappeared underwater and, despite the fact that Carol \par
treaded water for a couple of minutes and scanned the horizon, she never saw him \par
again.\par
\tab At length Carol began swimming back toward shore.  Her heart rate had \par
started to return to normal after the bizarre encounter and now she was thinking \par
about her lifelong fascination with whales.  She remembered having a toy whale \par
from Sea World, in San Diego, when she was seven.  What was his name?  Shammy.  \par
Shamu.  Something like that.  Then Carol remembered an earlier experience, one \par
she had not thought about for twenty-five years.\par
\tab Carol was five or six and sitting in her room, ready for bed as requested, \par
and her father came into the room carrying a picture book.  They sat together on \par
the bed and leaned against the wallpaper with yellow flowers while he read to \par
her.  She loved it when he put his arm around her and turned the pages in her \par
lap.  She felt protected and comfortable.  He read to her a story about a whale \par
that seemed human and a man named Captain Ahab.  The pictures were frightening, \par
one in particular showed a boat being tossed about by a giant whale with a \par
harpoon stuck in his back.\par
\tab When her father tucked her in that night he seemed to linger in the room, \par
showering her with tender hugs and kisses.  She saw tears in his eyes and asked \par
him if anything was wrong.  Her father just shook his head and told her that he \par
loved her so much, sometimes it made him cry.\par
\tab Carol was so deep in this vivid memory that she wasn't paying attention to \par
where she was swimming.  She had drifted west with the current and could now \par
barely see the hotel.  It took her a few minutes to orient herself and head back \par
in the right direction.\par

LIEUTENANT Richard Todd waited impatiently while the data processing assistant \par
made the last corrections on the master sheets.  "Come on, come on.  The meeting \par
is supposed to start in five minutes.  And we have a couple more changes to \par
make."\par
\tab The poor girl was clearly hassled by the Navy officer hanging over her \par
shoulder while she worked at the design monitor.  She corrected a couple of \par
spelling errors on one sheet and pushed the return key.  On the screen in front \par
of her appeared a computer line-drawn map of South Florida and the Keys.  With a \par
light pen she tried to follow Lieutenant Todd's instructions and highlight the \par
specific areas described by him.\par
\tab "There," he said finally, "that's good.  That finishes the group.  Now hit \par
the hard copy repro button.  What's the initial key?  17BROK01?  Good.  On the \par
Top Secret data base?  All right.  Today's password?"\par
\tab "Matisse, Lieutenant," she answered, standing up to walk around the \par
machine and pick up a single collated hard copy of his presentation.  Todd had a \par
blank look on his face.  "He was a French painter," the girl said sarcastically, \par
"M-A-T-I-S-S-E, in case you're wondering."\par
\tab Todd signed out for his copy of the material and then scribbled the \par
spelling of Matisse on a sheet of scratch paper.  He awkwardly thanked the girl \par
in a minimal way and left the room, heading out of the building and across the \par
street.\par
\tab The conference center for the U.S.  Naval Air Station in Key West was next \par
door.  It was a brand-new building of modem design, one of the few edifices on \par
the base to break the architectural monotone that could best be described as \par
"white stucco, World War II."  Lieutenant Todd worked in one of the nondescript \par
white buildings as head of Special Projects for the site.  Todd and his group \par
were essentially troubleshooters for the command, crackerjack systems engineers \par
who were moved from project to project depending upon where they were needed.  \par
Todd himself was twenty-eight, an Annapolis graduate in aerospace engineering, a \par
gung-ho Navy bachelor who had grown up in Littleton, a suburb of Denver in \par
Colorado.  Todd was ambitious and in a hurry.  He felt as if he were out of the \par
mainstream down here in Key West and longed for a chance to move to somewhere he \par
could really prove his mettle, a weapons design center, for example, or even the \par
Pentagon.\par
\tab The sign on the door in the conference center read TOP SECRET \emdash  BROKEN \par
ARROW.  Lieutenant Todd checked his watch.  One minute remained before 0930, the \par
time for the meeting.  He entered an alphanumeric code into the door lock and \par
walked into the back of a midsized conference room with three large screens in \par
the front.  His group of five younger officers and a couple of members of the \par
senior staff had already arrived.  They were standing around the coffee and \par
donuts that were on a table at the left.  Commander Vernon Winters was sitting \par
alone at the center of a long table that ran across the room and virtually \par
bisected it.  He was facing the screens with his back to the entrance.\par
\tab "All right, all right," Winters said, first looking around the room and \par
then at the digital time printout in the upper left corner of the front wall, \par
"let's get started.  Are you ready Lieutenant Todd?"  The other officers sat \par
down at the table.  At the last minute another senior staff officer entered the \par
room and took a seat in one of the chairs at the back.\par
\tab Todd walked around the table to the front of the room, to a podium with a \par
built-in keyboard underneath a small monitor, and eyed Commander Winters.  "Yes, \par
sir," he answered.  He activated the computer system in the podium.  Todd \par
indicated that he wanted access to the Top Secret Data Base.  He then entered a \par
complicated keyed input that was the first pan of a password system.  The \par
interactive monitor in the podium next requested the password of the day.  \par
Todd's first attempt was unsuccessful, for he hadn't remembered the correct \par
spelling.  He began to search his pockets for the piece of scrap paper.\par
\tab The only other keyboard in the room was in the center of the long table \par
where Winters was sitting.  While Lieutenant Todd fumbled around at the podium, \par
the commander smiled, entered the password, and then added some code of his own.  \par
The center screen came alive in vivid color and showed a stylized woman in a \par
yellow dress, sitting at a piano, while two young boys played checkers behind \par
her.  A sense of red flooded forth from the picture.  It was a reproduction of \par
one of Matisse's paintings from his late years in Nice and was magnificently \par
projected at the front of the room.  Lieutenant Todd looked startled.  A couple \par
of the senior officers laughed.\par
\tab Winters smiled engagingly.  "There are some fairly amazing things that can \par
be done with the resolution power of a 4K-by-4K image and a nearly infinite data \par
base." There was an awkward silence and then Winters continued.  "I guess it's \par
hopeless to keep trying to expand the education of you young officers on this \par
base.  Go on.  Continue.  I've put you already into the Top Secret Data Base and \par
any new input will override the picture."\par
\tab Todd composed himself.  This man Winters is certainly a queer duck, he \par
thought.  The admiral who was the commanding officer of the Key West base had \par
assigned the commander last night to lead this important Panther missile \par
investigation.  Winters had an impressive background in missiles and in systems \par
engineering, but whoever heard of starting such a critical meeting by calling a \par
painting up on the screen?  Todd now entered 17BROK01 and, after counting the \par
people, the number nine.  In a few seconds a machine in the back corner of the \par
room had copies of the presentation collated and stapled for the use of the \par
participants.  Todd called his first image (entitled "Introduction and \par
Background") to the center screen with another touch of the keyboard.\par
\tab "Yesterday morning," he began, "a demonstration test for the new Panther \par
missile was conducted over the North Atlantic.  The missile was fired at 0700 \par
from an airplane at eighty thousand feet off the coast of Labrador.  It was \par
aimed at a target near the Bahamas, one of our old aircraft carriers.  After \par
flying a normal ballistic trajectory into the region where the ship was located, \par
the Panther was supposed to activate its terminal guidance that uses the \par
Advanced Pattern Recognition System or APRS.  The missile should then have found \par
the aircraft carrier and, using the reaction control jets as its primary control \par
authority, made whatever vernier corrections were necessary to impact the old \par
carrier on the main deck."\par
\tab Todd pushed a key on the podium and a line drawing map of the American \par
east coast, including the area from Labrador through Cuba, appeared on the left \par
screen.  "The missile was a final test version," he continued, "in the exact \par
configuration of the production flight vehicle, except for the command test set \par
and the warhead.  This was to be the longest test flight yet conducted and was \par
designed to demonstrate thoroughly the new 4.2 version of the software that was \par
recently installed in the APRS.  So of course the missile was not armed."\par
\tab The lieutenant picked up a light pen from the podium and marked on the \par
small monitor in front of him.  His markings were immediately translated to the \par
larger screen behind him so that everyone could easily follow his discussion.  \par
"On the screen you all can see the predicted versus actual overflight path of \par
the bird yesterday.  Here, roughly ten miles east of Cape Canaveral on what \par
appeared to be a nominal flight, the sequencer turned on the cameras.  After a \par
couple of hundred calibration images, sort of a self-test of the APRS, the \par
terminal guidance algorithms were activated as scheduled.  As far as we can tell \par
from the realtime telemetry, nothing strange had occurred until this time."\par
\tab The right screen now showed a detailed map of south Florida and the Keys \par
that included the target in the Bahamas.  The maps on the two flanking screens \par
remained in view during the rest of his presentation but Lieutenant Todd \par
constantly changed the word charts in the middle to keep up with the discussion.  \par
"The a priori location of the target, which was where the cameras should first \par
have looked for the aircraft carrier, was here at Eleuthera, in the Bahamas.  \par
The search algorithm should have fanned out in a circle from there and, if it \par
had operated properly, found the target in about fifteen seconds.  This (Todd \par
pointed toward a dotted line on the more detailed map) should have been the \par
impact trajectory.\par
\tab "However," Todd continued dramatically, "based on the telemetry data that \par
we have analyzed to date, it appears that the missile veered sharply westward, \par
toward the coast of Florida, soon after the terminal guidance system was \par
activated.  We have only been able to reconstruct its path up to this point, \par
where it was about three miles west of Miami Beach at an altitude of ten \par
thousand feet.  After that the telemetry becomes intermittent and erratic.  But \par
we do know that all the terminal guidance engines were on at the time we lost \par
complete data.  Projecting the total control authority for the missile, the area \par
highlighted here, covering the Everglades, the Keys, and even as far south as \par
Cuba, represents where the bird might have landed."\par
\tab Lieutenant Todd paused for a second and Commander Winters, who had been \par
writing down major points in a small notebook during the presentation, \par
immediately jumped in and started taking charge of the meeting.  "A couple of \par
questions, Lieutenant, before we proceed," Winters began in a businesslike \par
manner with an obvious overtone of authority.  "First, why was the missile not \par
destroyed soon after it veered off course?"\par
\tab "We're not exactly certain, Commander.  The command test set and the small \par
ordnance had been installed, of course, specifically for that purpose.  The \par
change in the motion of the vehicle was so sudden and so unexpected that we \par
reacted a little slowly at the beginning.  By the time we sent the command, it's \par
possible that we were out of range.  All we know is that we never saw an \par
explosion of any kind.  We can only assume \emdash  "\par
\tab "We'll come back to this operational error later," Winters interrupted him \par
again.  Todd blanched at the word "error" and fidgeted behind the podium.  \par
"Where would the impact point have been according to the guidance constants \par
active at the time of the last complete telemetry packet?  And how long is it \par
going to take us to extract additional information from the intermittent data?"\par
\tab Lieutenant Todd noted to himself that the commander was sharp.  Winters \par
had obviously been associated with anomaly investigations before.  Todd then \par
explained that if the active guidance constants had not changed again, the \par
continued firing of the terminal engines would have brought the missile to an \par
impact point about twenty miles south of Key West.  "However," Todd added, "the \par
constants were allowed, by the software, to change every five seconds.  And they \par
had changed in two of the last five internal data updates.  So it's unlikely \par
they stayed the same as they were when our complete telemetry terminated.  \par
Unfortunately, although all the constants \emdash  even the future predicted ones that \par
are being calculated by the APRS-are stored in the onboard computer, because of \par
bandwidth limitations we only transmit the active constants with the realtime \par
telemetry.  We are now going through the dropout data manually to see if we can \par
find out anything more about the constants."\par
\tab One of the other staff officers asked a question about the probability of \par
the missile actually having reached Cuba.  Lieutenant Todd answered "very low" \par
and then activated an electronic overlay that placed a dotted and blinking \par
trajectory on the right screen inset map.  The blinking dots followed a path \par
that started just off Coral Gables, south of the city of Miami, and then \par
continued across a portion of south Florida into the Gulf of Mexico, across the \par
Keys, and finally into the ocean again.  "It is along this line that we intend \par
to concentrate our search.  Unless the bird suddenly changed its mind its \par
general heading would have been consistent with a perceived target located \par
anywhere along this path.  And since we have no reports of any land impact near \par
a populated area, we assume that the missile landed in the Everglades or the \par
ocean."\par
\tab Lieutenant Todd had consulted briefly with Winters the previous evening on \par
the agenda for the meeting.  It had been scheduled to last only an hour, but the \par
number of questions caused it to stretch to an hour and a half.  Todd was \par
thorough and precise in his presentation but was obviously dismayed by Winters' \par
continued probing into the possibility of human error.  The lieutenant freely \par
admitted that they had blown the procedure to destroy the missile when it went \par
awry, but defended his men by citing the unusual circumstances and the nearly \par
perfect previous record enjoyed by the Panther missile.  He also explained that \par
they were going to equip their search vessels with the best possible \par
instrumentation ("including the new ocean telescope developed by the Miami \par
Oceanographic Institute") and begin searching the outlined areas in earnest the \par
next day.\par
\tab Winters asked many questions about the possible cause of the missile's \par
strange behavior.  Todd told him that he and his staff were convinced that it \par
was a software problem, that some new or updated algorithm in the 4.2 version of \par
the software had somehow scrambled both the initialization sequence and the \par
optically stored target parameters.  Winters accepted their opinion eventually, \par
but not until he ordered them to prepare a "top down" failure modes analysis \par
that would list every possible hardware, software, or operational error (Todd \par
winced when Winters mentioned operations again) that could lead to the kind of \par
problem observed.\par
\tab Toward the end of the meeting Winters reiterated the secrecy of the \par
activity and pointed out that the Broken Arrow project was to remain completely \par
unknown to the press.  "Commander," Todd broke in while Winters was explaining \par
the press policy.  The lieutenant had begun the meeting with confidence but was \par
feeling increasingly unsettled.  "Sir, I had a call late yesterday afternoon \par
from a reporter, a Carolyn or Kathy Dawson I think, from the Miami Herald.  She \par
told me that she had heard of some special activity down here and that I was \par
supposedly connected with it.  She claimed her source was someone in the \par
Pentagon."\par
\tab Winters shook his head.  "Shit, Lieutenant, why didn't you say something \par
before this?  Can't you imagine what will happen if the word gets out that one \par
of our missiles wandered over Miami?"  He paused.  "What did you tell her?"\par
\tab "I didn't tell her anything.  But I think she is still suspicious.  She \par
called the public affairs office after she talked to me."\par
\tab Winters gave an order that the existence of the Broken Arrow investigation \par
was to be kept classified and that any and all inquiries about it were to be \par
referred to him.  He then called for the next status meeting at 1500 on the \par
following day, Friday, by which time (he told Lieutenant Todd) the commander \par
expected to see the results of the analysis of the intermittent telemetry, a \par
more complete logic breakdown of the failure modes, and a list of recent open \par
items with the 4.2 software.\par
\tab Lieutenant Richard Todd left the meeting aware that this assignment was \par
going to have a significant impact on his career.  It was clear to the \par
lieutenant that his personal competence was already being questioned by this \par
Commander Winters.  Todd intended to respond to the challenge in a positive way.  \par
First he called a small postmortem meeting of the junior officers in his group.  \par
He told them (they were all young ensigns, just out of the university after \par
completing a Navy ROTC program) that their collective ass was on the line.  Then \par
he defined a series of action items that would keep all of them up working for \par
most of the night.  It was imperative to Todd that he be properly prepared for \par
the next meeting.\par
\par
\par

\par
\tab KEY West was proud of its new marina.  Completed in 1992 just after the \par
explosion in cruises had brought an influx of new visitors to the old city, the \par
marina was thoroughly modem.  Scattered around the jetties on high towers were \par
automatic cameras that constantly surveyed the marina.  These cameras and the \par
rest of the electronic surveillance systems were just one facet of an elaborate \par
security setup that protected the slips when the boat owners were absent.  \par
Another of the new features of the Hemmingway Marina (it was naturally named \par
after the most famous resident of Key West) was a centralized navigation control \par
center.  Here, using a virtually automatic traffic control system, a single \par
controller was able to pass instructions to all the vessels in the harbor and \par
provide for efficient handling of the burgeoning water traffic.\par
\tab The marina was built on Key West Bight, on what had been a decaying part \par
of the waterfront.  It had slips for almost four hundred boats and its \par
completion changed the nature of the city's commerce.  Young professionals \par
wanting to be near their boats at the marina quickly purchased and upgraded all \par
the wonderful nineteenth-century houses that lined Caroline and Eaton streets on \par
what was known as the Pelican Path.  Smart shops, toney restaurants, even little \par
theaters crowded into the area around the marina to create an atmosphere of \par
bustle and excitement.  There was even a new Japanese hotel, the Miyako Gardens, \par
which was famous for its magnificent collection of tropical birds that played in \par
the waterfalls and ferns of its atrium.\par
\tab Just before noon Carol Dawson walked into the marina headquarters and \par
approached the circular information desk in the middle of the large room.  She \par
was wearing a sharp silk blouse, light purple in color, and a pair of long white \par
cotton slacks that covered the tops of her white tennis shoes.  Two petite ruby \par
and gold bracelets were wrapped around her right wrist, and a huge amethyst set \par
in a gold basket at the end of a neck chain dangled perfectly at the vertex of \par
the "V" in her open blouse.  She looked stunning, like a well-heeled tourist \par
about to rent a boat for the afternoon.\par
\tab The young girl behind the information desk was in her early twenties.  She \par
was blonde, fairly attractive in the clean-cut American style originally \par
typified by Cheryl Tiegs.  She watched Carol with just a tinge of competitive \par
jealously as the journalist moved purposefully across the room.  "Can I help \par
you?" she said with feigned cheer as Carol reached the desk.\par
\tab "I would like to charter a boat for the rest of the day."  Carol began.  \par
"I want to go out to do a little diving and a little swimming and maybe see some \par
of the interesting ship-wrecks around here."  She planned to say nothing about \par
the whales until she had picked the boat.\par
\tab "Well, you've come to the right place," the girl responded.  She turned to \par
the computer on her left and prepared to use the keyboard.  "My name is Julianne \par
and one of my jobs here is to help tourists find the boats that are just right \par
for their recreational needs."  Carol noted that Julianne sounded as if she had \par
memorized the little speech.  "Did you have any particular price in mind?  \par
Although most of the boats here at Hemingway are private vessels, we still do \par
have all sorts of boats for charter and most of them meet your requirements.  \par
Assuming of course that they're still available."\par
\tab Carol shook her head and in a few minutes she was handed a computer \par
listing that included nine boats.  "Here are the boats that are possible," the \par
girl said.  "As I told you, there's quite a range in price."\par
\tab Carol's eyes scanned down the list.  The biggest and most expensive boat \par
was the Ambrosia, a fifty-four-footer that chartered for eight hundred dollars a \par
day, or five hundred for a half day.  The list included a couple of intermediate \par
entries as well as two small boats, twenty-six-footers, that rented for half the \par
price of the Ambrosia.  "I'd like to talk to the captain of the Ambrosia first," \par
Carol said, after a moment's hesitation.  "Where do I go?"\par
\tab "Do you know Captain Homer?"  Julianne replied, a strange smile starting \par
to form at the corner of her mouth.  "Homer Ashford," she said again slowly, as \par
if the name should be recognized.  Carol's mind began going through a memory \par
search routine.  The name was familiar.  Where had she heard it?  A long time \par
ago, in a news program .  .  .\par
\tab Carol had not quite retrieved the memory when the girl continued.  "I'll \par
let them know that you're coming." Below the desk counter on the right was a \par
huge bank of relay switches, several hundred in all, apparently connected to a \par
speaker system.  Julianne flipped one of the switches and turned to Carol.  "It \par
should only be a minute," she said.\par
\tab "Vat is it, Julianne?" a booming feminine voice inquired within about \par
twenty seconds.  The voice was foreign, German Judging from the way the first \par
word was pronounced.  And the voice was also impatient.\par
\tab "There's a woman here, Greta, a Miss Carol Dawson from Miami, and she \par
wants to come down to talk to Captain Homer about chartering the yacht for the \par
afternoon."\par
\tab After a moment's silence, Greta was heard again, "Ya, okay, send her \par
down." Julianne motioned for Carol to walk halfway around the circular desk to \par
where a familiar keyboard was sitting in a small well on the counter.  Carol had \par
been through this process many times since the UIS (Universal Identification \par
System) was first introduced in 1991.  Using the keyboard, she entered her name \par
and her social security number.  Carol wondered which verification question it \par
would be this time.  Her birthplace?  Her mother's maiden name?  Her father's \par
birth date?  It was always random, selected from the twenty personal facts that \par
were immutable and belonged to each individual.  To impersonate someone now \par
really took an effort.\par
\tab "Miss Carol Dawson, 1418 Oakwood Gardens, Apt. 17, Miami Beach."  Carol \par
nodded her head.  Blonde Julianne obviously enjoyed her role of checking out the \par
prospective clients.  "What was your birth date?"  Carol was asked.\par
\tab "December 27, 1963," Carol responded.  Julianne's face registered that \par
Carol had given the correct answer.  But Carol could see something else in her \par
face, something competitive and even supercilious, almost a "Ha-ha-de-ha-ha, I'm \par
lots younger than you are and now I know it."  Usually Carol didn't pay \par
attention to such trivia.  But for some reason, this morning she was \par
uncomfortable about the fact that she was now thirty.  She started to indicate \par
her annoyance to smug little Julianne but thought better of it and held her \par
tongue.\par
\tab Julianne gave her instructions.  "Walk out that door over there, at the \par
far right, and walk straight until you come to Jetty Number 4.  Then turn left \par
and insert this card in the gate lock.  Slip "P" as in Peter is where the \par
Ambrosia is berthed.  It's a long walk, way down at the end of the jetty.  But \par
you can't miss the yacht, it's one of the largest and most beautiful boats at \par
Hemingway."\par
\par
\tab Julianne was right.  It was quite a hike to the end of Jetty Number 4.  \par
Carol Dawson probably passed a total of thirty boats of all sizes, on both sides \par
of the jetty, before she reached the Ambrosia.  By the time Carol could discern \par
the bold blue identifying letters on the front of the cabin, she had started to \par
sweat from the heat and humidity of late morning.\par
\tab Captain Homer Ashford walked up the gangplank to meet her when she finally \par
reached the Ambrosia.  He was in his mid to late fifties, an enormous man, well \par
over six feet tall and weighing close to two hundred and fifty pounds.  His hair \par
was still thick, but the original black color had now almost completely \par
surrendered to the gray.\par
\tab Captain Homer's wild eyes had followed Carol's approach with undisguised \par
lubricious delight.  Carol recognized the look and her reaction was one of \par
immediate disgust.  She started to turn around and go back to the marina \par
headquarters.  But she stopped herself, realizing that it was a long walk back \par
and that she was already hot and tired.  Captain Homer, apparently sensing her \par
disapproval by the change in her gait, changed his leer to an avuncular smile.\par
\tab "Miss Dawson, I presume?" the captain said, bowing slightly with fake \par
gallantry.  "Welcome to the Ambrosia.  Captain Homer Ashford and his crew at \par
your service.  "Carol reluctantly smiled.  This buffoon in the outrageous blue \par
Hawaiian shirt at least did not appear to take himself too seriously.  Still \par
slightly wary, she took the proffered Coke from his out-stretched hand and \par
followed him along the smaller side jetty beside the boat.  The two of them then \par
descended onto the yacht.  It was huge.\par
\tab "We understand from Julianne that you are interested in a charter for this \par
afternoon.  We would love to take you out to one of our favorite spots, Dolphin \par
Key." They were standing in front of the wheelhouse and the covered cabin area \par
as they talked.  Captain Homer was clearly already into his sales pitch.  From \par
somewhere nearby Carol could hear the clang of metal.  It sounded like barbells.\par
\tab "Dolphin Key is a marvelous isolated island," Captain Homer continued, \par
"perfect for swimming and even nude sunbathing, if you like that sort of thing.  \par
There's also a sunken wreck from the eighteenth century not more than a couple \par
of miles away if you're interested in doing some diving."  Carol took another \par
drink from her Coke and looked at Homer for an instant.  She quickly averted her \par
eyes.  He was leering again.  His peculiar emphasis on the word "nude" had \par
somehow changed Carol's mental picture of Dolphin Key from a quiet tropical \par
paradise to a gathering place for debauchery and peeping Toms.  Carol recoiled \par
from Captain Homer's light touch as he guided her around the side of the yacht.  \par
This man is a creep, she thought.  I should have followed my first instincts and \par
turned around.\par
\tab The clang of metal grew louder as they walked past the entrance to the \par
cabin and approached the front of the luxurious boat.  Carol's journalistic \par
curiosity was piqued; the sound seemed so out of place.  She hardly paid \par
attention as Captain Homer pointed out all the outstanding features of the \par
yacht.  When they finally had a clear view of the front deck of the Ambrosia, \par
Carol saw that the sound had indeed been barbells.  A blonde woman with her back \par
toward them was working out with weights on the front deck.\par
\tab The woman's body was magnificent, even breathtaking.  As she strained to \par
finish her repetitive presses, she lifted the barbells high over her head \par
Rivulets of sweat cascaded down the muscles that seemed to descend in ripples \par
from her shoulders.  She was wearing a low-cut black leotard, almost backless, \par
whose thin straps did not seem capable of holding up the rest of the outfit.  \par
Captain Homer had stopped talking about the boat.  Carol noticed that he was \par
standing in rapt admiration, apparently transfixed by the sensual beauty of the \par
sweaty woman in the leotard.  This place is weird, Carol thought.  Maybe that's \par
why the girl asked me if I knew these people.\par
\tab The woman put the weights back on the small rack and picked up a towel \par
When she turned around Carol could see that she was in her mid to late thirties, \par
pretty in an athletic sort of way .  Her breasts were large and taut and clearly \par
visible in the scant leotard.  But it was her eyes that were truly remarkable.  \par
They were gray-blue in color and they seemed to look right through you.  Carol \par
thought that the woman's first piercing glance was hostile, almost threatening.\par
\tab "Greta," said Captain Homer, when she looked at him after her first glance \par
at Carol, "this is Miss Carol Dawson.  She may be our charter for this \par
afternoon."\par
\tab Greta did not smile or say anything.  She wiped the sweat off her brow, \par
took a couple of deep breaths, and put the towel behind her neck and over her \par
shoulders.  She squared herself off to face Carol and Captain Homer.  Then with \par
her shoulders back and her hands on her hips, she flexed her chest muscles.  \par
With each flexure her abundant breasts seemed to stretch up toward her neck.  \par
Throughout this routine her incredibly clear eyes evaluated Carol, checking out \par
her body and clothing in minute detail.  Carol squirmed involuntarily.\par
\tab "Well, hello, Greta," she said, her usual aplomb strangely absent in this \par
awkward moment, "nice to meet you."  Jesus, Carol thought, as Greta just looked \par
at Carol's outstretched hand for several seconds, let me out of here.  I must be \par
on a strange planet or having a nightmare.\par
\tab "Greta sometimes likes to have fun with our customers," Captain Homer said \par
to Carol, "but don't let it put you off."  Was he irritated with Greta?  Carol \par
thought she detected some unspoken communication between Greta and Captain \par
Homer, for at length Greta smiled.  But it was an artificial smile.\par
\tab "Velcome to the Ambrosia," Greta said, mimicking Captain Homer's first \par
remarks to Carol.  "Our pleasure avaits you."  Greta lifted her arms over her \par
head, watching Carol again, and began to stretch.  "Come vit us to paradise," \par
Greta said.\par
\tab Carol felt Captain Homer's burly hand on her elbow, turning her around.  \par
She also thought she saw an angry glance from Homer to Greta.  "The Ambrosia is \par
the finest charter vessel in Key West," he said, guiding her back toward the \par
stem and resuming his sales pitch.  "It has every possible convenience and \par
luxury.  Giant screen cable television, compact disc player with quad speakers, \par
automatic chef programmed with over a hundred gourmet dishes, robot massage.  \par
And nobody knows the Keys like Captain Homer.  I've been diving and fishing \par
these waters for fifty years."\par
\tab They had stopped at the entrance to the cabin area in the middle of the \par
yacht.  Through the glass door Carol could see stairs descending to another \par
level.  "Would you like to come down and see the galley and the bedroom?"  \par
Captain Homer said, without a trace of the earlier suggestiveness.  He was a \par
clever chameleon, there was no doubt about that.  Carol revised her earlier \par
judgment of him as a buffoon.  But what was this business with muscle-bound \par
Greta, whoever she is, Carol wondered.  And just what is going on here?  Why are \par
they so strange?\par
\tab "No, thank you, Captain Ashford."  Carol saw her opportunity to exit \par
gracefully.  She handed him what was left of the unfinished Coke.  "I've seen \par
enough.  It's a magnificent yacht but I can tell it's much too expensive for a \par
single woman wanting to spend a relaxing afternoon.  But thanks a lot for your \par
time and the brief tour."\par
\tab She started to walk toward the gangplank to the jetty.  Captain Homer's \par
eyes narrowed, "But we haven't even discussed price, Miss Dawson.  I'm certain \par
that for someone like you we could make a special deal .  .  ."\par
\tab Carol could tell that he was not going to let her go without some \par
additional discussion.  As she started to leave the yacht, Greta came up beside \par
Captain Homer.  "It vould give you sometink to write about for your paper," \par
Greta said with a bizarre smile.  "Sometink unusual."\par
\tab Carol turned, startled.  "So you recognized me?" she said, stating the \par
obvious.  The strange pair grinned back at her.  "Why didn't you say something?"\par
\tab Captain Homer simply shrugged his huge shoulders.  "We thought maybe you \par
were traveling incognito, or were looking for some special fun, or maybe even \par
were working on a story .  .  ."  His voice trailed off Carol smiled and shook \par
her head.  Then she waved good-bye, mounted the gangplank, and turned on the \par
jetty toward the distant marina headquarters.  Who are those people? she asked \par
herself again.  Now I'm certain that I have seen them before.  But where?\par
\par
*     *     *     *     *\par
\par
\tab Twice Carol looked over her shoulder to see if Captain Homer and Greta \par
were still watching her.  The second time, when she was almost a hundred yards \par
away, they were no longer in sight.  She sighed with relief.  The experience had \par
definitely unnerved her.\par
\tab Carol walked on slowly.  She pulled the computer listing that Julianne had \par
given her from a small purple beach bag.  Before she could look at it, she heard \par
a telephone ring on her left and her eyes lifted naturally to follow the sound.  \par
The telephone was ringing on a boat just in front of her.  A husky man in his \par
early thirties was sitting in a folding chair on the same boat.  Wearing only a \par
red baseball cap, a pair of swim trunks, dark sunglasses and some thongs, the \par
man was intently watching a small television propped up on a flimsy tray of some \par
kind.  He held a sandwich in one hand (Carol could see the white mayonnaise \par
oozing out between the slices of bread even from her distance of ten yards or \par
so) and a can of beer in the other.  There was no sign that the man in the red \par
cap even heard the telephone.\par
\tab Carol moved closer, a little curious.  A basketball game was in progress \par
on the television.  On about the sixth ring of the phone, the man gave a small \par
cheer (with his mouth full of sandwich) in the direction of the six-inch picture \par
tube, took a swig from his beer, and abruptly jumped up to answer the call.  The \par
telephone was underneath a canopy in the center of the boat, on a wooden paneled \par
wall behind the steering wheel and next to some built-in counters that appeared \par
to contain the navigation and radio equipment for the boat.  The man fiddled \par
with the steering wheel unconsciously during the brief conversation and never \par
took his eyes off the television.  He hung up, issued another short cheer, and \par
returned to his folding chair.\par
\tab Carol was now standing on the jetty, just inches away from the front of \par
the boat and no more than ten feet away from where the man was sitting.  But he \par
was oblivious to her, totally absorbed in his basketball game.  "All right," he \par
shouted all at once, reacting to something pleasing in the game.  He jumped up.  \par
The sudden movement caused the boat to rock and the jerrybuilt tray underneath \par
the television gave way.  The man reached out quickly and grabbed the TV before \par
it hit the ground, but in so doing he lost his balance and fell forward on his \par
elbows.\par
\tab "Shit," he said to himself, wincing from the pain.  He was lying on the \par
deck, his sunglasses cocked sideways on his head, the game still continuing on \par
the little set in his hands.  Carol could not suppress her laughter.  Now aware \par
that he was not alone for the first time, Nick Williams, the owner and operator \par
of the Florida Queen, turned in the direction of the feminine laugh.\par
\tab "Excuse me," Carol began in a friendly way, "I just happened to be walking \par
by and I saw you fall .  .  ."  She stopped.  Nick was not amused.\par
\tab "What do you want?"  Nick fixed her with a truculent glare.  He stood up, \par
still holding (and watching) the television and now trying as well to put the \par
tray back together.  He didn't have enough hands to do everything at once.\par
\tab "You know," Carol said, still smiling, "I could help you with that, if it \par
wouldn't injure your masculine pride."  Uh oh, Nick thought in a flash, Another \par
pushy, assertive broad.\par
\tab Nick put the television down on the deck of the boat and began to \par
reassemble the tray.  "No thank you," he said.  "I can manage."  Obviously \par
ignoring Carol, he set the TV back on the tray, returned to his folding chair, \par
and picked up his sandwich and beer.\par
\tab Carol was amused by what Nick had clearly intended as a putdown.  She \par
looked around the boat.  Neatness was not one of the strengths of the \par
proprietor.  Little odds and ends, including masks, snorkels, regulators, \par
towels, and even old lunches from fast-food restaurants were scattered all over \par
the front of the boat.  In one of the corners someone had obviously taken apart \par
a piece of electronic equipment, perhaps for repair, and left the entire works a \par
jumbled mess.  Mounted on the top of the blue canopy were two signs, each with a \par
different type of print, one giving the name of the boat and the other saying \par
THANK YOU FOR NOT SMOKING.\par
\tab The boat looked out of character for the sleek modern marina and Carol \par
imagined the other boat owners reacting with disgust each day as they passed the \par
Florida Queen.  On an impulse Carol looked at the computer listing in her hand.  \par
She almost laughed out loud when she saw the boat listing as one of the nine \par
available for hire.\par
\tab "Excuse me," she began, intending to start the discussion about chartering \par
the boat for the afternoon.\par
\tab Nick heaved an exaggerated sigh and turned away from his televised \par
basketball game.  The miffed look on his face was unmistakable.  It said, What?  \par
Are you still here?  I thought we'd finished our conversation.  Now go away and \par
let me enjoy the afternoon on my boat.\par
\tab Mischievous Carol couldn't resist the opportunity to harass the arrogant \par
Mr. Williams (she assumed that the name on the computer listing and the man in \par
front of her were the same, for she couldn't imagine a crew member acting with \par
such apparent confidence and authority on someone else's boat).  "Who's \par
playing?" she said cheerfully, as if she had no idea that Nick was trying to get \par
rid of her.\par
\tab "Harvard and Tennessee," he answered gruffly, amazed that Carol hadn't got \par
the message.\par
\tab "What's the score?" she said quickly, now enjoying the game she had just \par
created.\par
\tab Nick turned around again, his quizzical look acknowledging his \par
exasperation.  "It's 31-29 Harvard," he said sharply, "just before the end of \par
the first half."  Carol didn't move.  She simply smiled and returned his fierce \par
stare without blinking.  "And it's the first round of the NCAA tournament and \par
they're playing in the Southeast Regional.  Any more questions?"\par
\tab "Just one," she said.  "I would like to charter this boat for the \par
afternoon.  Are you Nick Williams?"\par
\tab He was taken by surprise.  "Whaat?"  Nick said.  At that minute Tennessee \par
tied the basketball game again, distracting Nick even further.  He watched the \par
game for a couple of seconds and then tried to collect himself.  "But I have had \par
no calls from Julianne.  Anyone who wants to charter a boat here at Hemingway \par
has to sign in at the desk and .  .  ."\par
\tab "I came down to look at another boat first.  I didn't like it.  So I \par
stopped by here on the way back."  Nick was watching the television again and \par
Carol was losing her patience with him.  At first he had been amusing.  At least \par
I don't have to worry about his pawing me, she thought.  The guy can't even \par
concentrate on me enough to get his boat chartered.  "Look," she added, "do you \par
want a charter for this afternoon or not?\par
\tab The first half of the basketball game ended.  "All right .  .  .  I guess \par
so," Nick said slowly, thinking to himself, only because I need the money.  He \par
gestured to Carol to descend onto the deck of the boat.  "Let me just call \par
Julianne and make sure you're legit.  You never know these days."\par
\tab While Nick confirmed Carol's identification with the marina headquarters, \par
a jaunty young black man in his early twenties came down the jetty and stopped \par
just opposite the Florida Queen.  "Hey, Professor," he said, the moment Nick was \par
off the phone, "am I in the wrong place?"  He motioned to Carol.  "You didn't \par
tell me you were entertaining beauty, style, and class today.  Wooee!  Look at \par
that jewelry.  And that silk blouse.  Should I go now and come back to hear your \par
stories later?"  He winked at Carol.  "He's no good, angel.  All his girlfriends \par
eventually end up with me."\par
\tab "Cut the crap, Jefferson," Nick reacted, "this woman is a potential \par
customer.  And you're late, as usual.  How do you expect me to run a charter \par
dive boat when I don't have any idea when or if my crew is going to show up?"\par
\tab "Professor," the newcomer jumped down on the boat and walked up to Carol, \par
"if I had known that you had something that looked like this down here, I would \par
have been here before dawn.  Hello, there, young lady, my name is Troy \par
Jefferson.  I am the rest of the crew on this lunatic asylum of a boat."\par
\tab Carol had been slightly discombobulated by the arrival of Troy and the \par
quick repartee that followed.  But she adapted swiftly and regained her \par
composure.  She took Troy's out-stretched hand and smiled.  He immediately \par
leaned up and almost brushed his cheek against hers.  "Ooueee," Troy pulled back \par
grinning.  "I just caught a whiff of Oscar de la Renta.  Professor, didn't I \par
tell you this woman had class?  Well, angel," he looked at Carol in mock \par
admiration, "I just can't tell you how much it means to me to finally meet up \par
with someone like you on this tub.  Usually we get old ladies, I mean old \par
ladies, who want to \emdash  "\par
\tab "Enough, Jefferson," Nick interrupted him.  "We have work to do.  It's \par
almost noon already and we're still at least half an hour away from being ready \par
to leave.  We don't even know what Miss Dawson wants to do."\par
\tab "Carol is fine," she said.  She paused for a moment, assessing the two men \par
in front of her.  Might as well, Carol thought, nobody is going to suspect \par
anything if I'm with these two.  "Well, I told the desk that I wanted to go out \par
to do some swimming and diving.  But that's only partially true.  What I really \par
want to do is go out here (she pulled a folded map out of her beach bag and \par
showed them an area of about ten square miles in the Gulf of Mexico to the north \par
of Key West) and look for whales."\par
\tab Nick's brow furrowed.  Troy peered over Carol's shoulder at the map.  \par
"There have been numerous irregularities in the behavior of whales in this area \par
lately, including a major beaching at Deer Key this morning," Carol continued.  \par
"I want to see if I can find any pattern in their actions.  I may need to do \par
some diving so one of you will have to accompany me.  I assume that at least one \par
of you is a licensed diver and that your dive gear is onboard?"\par
\tab The two men regarded her with disbelieving stares.  Carol felt on the \par
defensive.  "Really .  .  .  I'm a reporter." she said as an explanation.  "I \par
work for the Miami Herald.  I just did a story this morning on the Deer Key \par
beaching."\par
\tab Troy turned to Nick.  "Okay, Professor, I guess we have a live charter \par
here.  One who says she wants to look for whales in the Gulf of Mexico.  What do \par
you say?  Should we accept her money?"\par
\tab Nick shrugged his shoulders indifferently and Troy took it as assent.  \par
"All right, angel," Troy said to Carol, "we'll be ready in half an hour.  We're \par
both licensed divers if we're really needed.  Our gear is onboard and we can get \par
more for you.  Why don't you pay Julianne at the desk and get your things \par
together."\par
\tab Troy turned and walked over to the jumbled mess of electronics at the \par
front of the boat.  He picked up one of the boxes with its housing partially \par
removed and began toying with it.  Nick pulled another beer out of the \par
refrigerator and opened the built-in counters, exposing racks of equipment.  \par
Carol did not move.  After about twenty seconds Nick noticed that she was still \par
there.  "Well," he said in a tone of dismissal, "didn't you hear Troy?  We won't \par
be ready for half an hour."  He turned around and walked toward the back of the \par
boat.\par
\tab Troy looked up from his repair work.  He was amused by the friction \par
already developing between Nick and Carol.  "Is he always so pleasant?"  Carol \par
said to Troy, nodding in Nick's direction.  She was still smiling but her tone \par
conveyed some irritation.  "I have a few pieces of equipment that I want to \par
bring onboard.  Can you give me a hand with it?"\par
\par
\tab Thirty minutes later Troy and Carol returned to the Florida Queen.  Troy \par
was grinning and whistling "Zippity-Do-Dah" as he pulled a cart down the jetty \par
and came to a stop in front of the boat.  A partially filled footlocker was \par
resting on the cart.  Troy could hardly wait to see Nick's face when he saw \par
Carol's "few pieces of equipment." Troy was excited by the turn of events.  He \par
knew that this was no casual afternoon charter.  Reporters, even successful ones \par
(and Troy's street intelligence had quickly informed him that Carol was not just \par
an ordinary reporter), did not have everyday access to the kind of equipment \par
that she was carrying.  Already Troy was certain that the whale story was just a \par
cover.  But he wasn't going to say anything just yet; he wanted to wait and see \par
how things developed.\par
\tab Troy liked this confident young woman.  There was not a trace of \par
superiority or prejudice in her manner.  And she had a good sense of humor.  \par
After they had opened the back of her station wagon and she had showed him the \par
footlocker full of equipment, Troy had demonstrated to Carol that he was fairly \par
sophisticated about electronics.  He had recognized immediately the MOI insignia \par
on Dale's ocean telescope and Troy had even guessed the meaning of the MOI-IPL \par
acronym on the back of the large monitor and data storage system.  When he had \par
looked at her for an explanation, Carol had just laughed and said, "So I need \par
some help finding the whales.  What can I say?"\par
\tab Carol and Troy had loaded the gear on the cart and wheeled it through the \par
parking lot.  She had been a little dismayed at first by Troy's recognition of \par
the origin of the equipment and his friendly, probing questions (which she \par
handled adroitly with vague answers \emdash  she was helped by the fact that Troy \par
wanted mostly to know how the electronics worked and she, in truth, didn't have \par
the foggiest idea).  But as they talked, Carol developed a comfortable feeling \par
about Troy.  Her intuitive sense told her that Troy was an ally and could be \par
counted on to be discreet with any important information.\par
\tab Carol had not, however, planned for a security check inside the Hemingway \par
Marina headquarters.  One of the primary selling points of the slips at the new \par
marina had been the almost unparalleled security system offered the boat owners.  \par
Every person who went in or out of the marina had to pass through computerized \par
gates adjacent to the headquarters building.  A full listing of each individual \par
entrance and exit, including the time of passage through the gate, was printed \par
out each night and retained in the security office files as a precaution in case \par
any suspicious or untoward events were reported.\par
\tab Materiel entering and leaving the marina was also routinely scrutinized \par
(and logged) by the security chief to prevent the theft of expensive navigation \par
equipment and other electronics.  Carol was only mildly irked when, after she \par
paid for the charter, Julianne asked her to fill out a sheet describing the \par
contents of the closed footlocker.  But Carol really objected when the summoned \par
security chief, a typical Boston Irish policeman who had retired in the Key West \par
area, Forced her to open the locker to verify the contents.  Carol's objections \par
and Troy's attempts to help her were to no avail.  Rules were rules.\par
\tab Because the cart would not fit through the door into the adjacent security \par
office, the footlocker was opened in the main clearing room of the marina \par
headquarters.  A couple of curious passersby, including one giant, friendly \par
woman about forty named Ellen (Troy knew her from somewhere, probably she was \par
one of the boat owners, Carol thought), came over and watched while Officer \par
O'Rourke carefully compared the contents of the locker with the list that Carol \par
had prepared.\par
\tab Carol was a little rattled as she and Troy pulled the cart down the jetty \par
toward the Florida Queen.  She had hoped to attract as little attention as \par
possible and she was now angry with herself for not anticipating the security \par
check.  Nick, meanwhile, after performing a few routine preparations on the boat \par
and opening another beer, had become engrossed again in the basketball game.  \par
His beloved Harvard was now losing to Tennessee.  He did not even hear Troy's \par
whistling until his crewman and Carol were just a few yards away.\par
\tab "Jesus," Nick turned around, "I thought you had gotten lost  .  .  ."  His \par
voice trailed off as he saw the cart and the foot-locker.  "What the fuck is \par
that?"\par
\tab "It's Miss Dawson's equipment, Professor," Troy answered with a big grin.  \par
He reached into the locker, first picking up a cylinder with a clear glass face, \par
a large flashlight-looking object on a mounting bracket.  It was about two feet \par
long and weighed about twelve pounds.  "Here, for example, is what she tells me \par
is an ocean telescope.  We attach it to the bottom of the boat by this bracket \par
and it takes pictures that are displayed on this here television monitor and \par
also stored on this other device, a recorder of some \emdash  "\par
\tab "Hold it," Nick interrupted Troy imperiously.  Nick walked up the \par
gangplank and stared incredulously into the locker.  He shook his head and \par
looked from Troy to Carol.  "Do I have this right?  We are supposed to set up \par
all this shit just to go out into the Gulf for one afternoon to look for \par
whales?"  He scowled at Troy.  "Where is your head, Jefferson?  This stuff is \par
heavy, it will take time to set it up, and it' s already after noon.\par
\tab "And as for you, sister," Nick continued, turning to Carol, "take your \par
toys and your treasure map elsewhere.  We know what you're up to and we have \par
more important things to do."\par
\tab "Are you through?"  Carol shouted at Nick as he walked back down the \par
gangplank onto the Florida Queen.  He stopped and turned partially around.  \par
"Look, you asshole."  Carol raged, giving vent to the frustration and anger that \par
had been building inside of her, "it is certainly your right to deny me the use \par
of your boat.  But it is not your right to act like God almighty and treat me or \par
anyone else like shit just because I'm a woman and you feel like pushing \par
somebody around."  She stepped toward him.  Nick backed up a step in the face of \par
her continued offensive.\par
\tab "I told you that I want to look for whales and that's what I intend to do.  \par
What you might think I'm doing is really of no significance to me.  As for the \par
important things that you have to do, you haven't moved from that goddamn \par
basketball game in the last hour, except to get more beer.  If you'll just stay \par
out of the way.  Troy and I can set all this gear in place in half an hour.  And \par
besides," Carol slowed down just a bit, starting to feel a little embarrassed \par
about her outburst, "I have already paid for the charter and you know how hard \par
it is to straighten out these computer credit card accounts."\par
\tab "Oooeee, Professor," Troy grinned wickedly and winked at Carol.  "Isn't \par
she something else?"  He stopped and became serious.  "Look, Nick, we need the \par
money, both of us.  And I would be happy to help her.  We can take off some of \par
the excess diving gear if it's necessary to balance the weight."\par
\tab Nick walked back to the folding chair and the television.  He took another \par
drink from his beer and did not turn around to look at Carol and Troy.  "All \par
right," he said, somewhat reluctantly.  "Get started.  But if we're not ready to \par
sail by one o'clock it's no deal."  The basketball players swam in front of his \par
eyes.  Harvard had tied the game again.  But this time he wasn't watching.  He \par
was thinking about Carol's outburst.  I wonder if she's right.  I wonder if I do \par
think that women are inferior.  Or worse.\par

\par
COMMANDER Vernon Winters was trembling when he hung up the phone.  He felt as if \par
he had just seen a ghost.  He threw his apple core in the wastebasket and \par
reached in his pocket for one of his Pall Malls.  Without thinking, he stood up \par
and walked across the room to the large bay window that opened onto the grassy \par
courtyard of the main administration building.  Lunch hour had just finished at \par
the U.S.  Naval Air Station.  The crowds of young men and women heading either \par
toward or away from the cafeteria had died out.  A solitary young ensign was \par
sitting on the grass reading a book, his back against a large tree.\par
\tab Commander Winters lit his nonfilter cigarette and inhaled deeply.  He \par
expelled the smoke with a rush and quickly took another breath.  "Hey, Indiana," \par
the voice had said two minutes before, "this is Randy.  Remember me?" As if he \par
could ever forget that nasal baritone.  And then, without waiting for an answer, \par
the voice had materialized into an earnest face on the video monitor.  Admiral \par
Randolph Hilliard was sitting behind his desk in a large Pentagon office.  \par
"Good," he continued, "now we can see each other."\par
\tab Hilliard had paused for a moment and then leaned forward toward the \par
camera.  "I was glad to hear that Duckett put you in charge of this Panther \par
business.  It could be nasty.  We must find out what happened, quickly and with \par
no publicity.  Both the secretary and I are counting on you."\par
\tab What had he said in response to the admiral?  Commander Winters couldn't \par
remember, but he assumed that it must have been all right.  And he did remember \par
the last few words, when Admiral Hilliard had said that he would call back for \par
an update after the meeting on Friday afternoon.  Winters had not heard that \par
voice for almost eight years but the recognition was instantaneous.  And the \par
memories that flooded forth were just a few milliseconds behind.\par
\tab The commander took another drag from his cigarette and turned away from \par
the window.  He walked slowly across the room.  His eyes slid across but did not \par
see the lovely, soft print of the Renoir painting, "Deux Jeunes Filles au \par
Piano," that was the most prominent object on his office wall.  It was his \par
favorite painting.  His wife and son had given him the special large \par
reproduction for his fortieth birthday; usually several times a week he would \par
stand in front of it and admire the beautiful composition.  But two graceful \par
young girls working on their afternoon piano lessons were not the order for the \par
day.\par
\tab Vernon Winters sat back down at his desk and buried his face in his hands.  \par
Here if comes again, he thought, I can't hold it back now, not after seeing \par
Randy and hearing that voice.  He looked around and then stubbed out the \par
cigarette in the large ashtray on his desk.  For a few moments he played \par
aimlessly with the two small framed photographs on his desk (one was a portrait \par
of a pale twelve-year-old boy together with a plain woman in her early forties; \par
the other was a cast photo from the Key West Players production of Cat on a Hot \par
Tin Roof, dated March 1993, in which Winters was dressed in a summer business \par
suit).  At length the commander put the photographs aside, leaned back in his \par
chair, closed his eyes, and succumbed to the powerful pull of his memory.  A \par
curtain in his mind parted and he was transported to a clear, warm night almost \par
eight years before, in early April of 1986.  The first sound that he heard was \par
the excited nasal voice of Lieutenant Randolph Hilliard.\par
\tab "Psst, Indiana, wake up.  How can you be asleep?  It's Randy.  We've got \par
to talk.  I'm so excited I could shit."  Vernon Winters had only fallen asleep \par
himself about an hour before.  He unconsciously looked at his watch.  Almost two \par
o'clock.  His friend stood next to his bunk, grinning from ear to ear.  "Only \par
three more hours and we attack.  Finally we're going to blast that A-rab lunatic \par
and terrorist supporter to heaven with Allah.  Shit, big buddy, this is our \par
moment.  This is what we worked our whole life for."\par
\tab Winters shook his head and began to come out of a deep sleep.  It took him \par
a moment to remember that he was onboard the USS Nimitz off the coast of Libya.  \par
The first action of his military career was about to occur.  "Look, Randy," \par
Winters had said eventually (on that night almost eight years ago) "shouldn't we \par
be sleeping?  What if the Libyans attack us tomorrow?  We'll have to be alert."\par
\tab "Shit no," said his friend and fellow officer, helping him to sit up and \par
handing him a cigarette, "those geeks will never attack someone who can fight.  \par
They're terrorists.  They only know how to fight unarmed people.  The only one \par
of them that has any guts is that Colonel Gaddafi and he's nutty as a fruitcake.  \par
After we blow him to kingdom come, the battle will be over.  Besides, I have \par
enough adrenaline flowing that I could stay awake for thirty-six hours with no \par
sweat."\par
\tab Winters felt the nicotine coursing through his body.  It reawakened the \par
eager anticipation that he had finally conquered when he had fallen asleep an \par
hour earlier.  Randy was talking a blue streak.  "I can't believe how goddamn \par
lucky we are.  For six years I have been wondering how an officer can stand out, \par
distinguish himself, you know, in peacetime.  Now here we are.  Some loonie \par
plants a bomb in a club in Berlin and we just happen to be on duty in the Med.  \par
Talk about being in the right place at the right time.  Shit.  Think how many \par
other midshipmen from our class would give their right nut to be here instead of \par
us.  Tomorrow we kill that crazy man and we're on our way to captain, maybe even \par
admiral, in five to eight years."\par
\tab Winters reacted negatively to his friend's suggestion that one of the \par
benefits of the strike against Gaddafi would be an acceleration in their \par
personal advancement.  But he said nothing.  He was already deep in his own \par
private thoughts.  He too was excited and he didn't fully understand why.  The \par
excitement was similar to the way he had felt before the state quarterfinals in \par
basketball in high school.  But Lieutenant Winters couldn't help wondering how \par
much the excitement would be leavened by fear if they were preparing to engage \par
in a real battle.\par
\tab For almost a week they had been getting ready for the strike.  It was \par
normal Navy business to go through the preparations for combat and then have \par
them called off, usually about a day ahead of the planned encounter.  But this \par
time it had been different from the beginning.  Hilliard and Winters had quickly \par
recognized that there was a seriousness in the senior officers that had never \par
been there before.  None of the usual horsing around and nonsense had been \par
tolerated in the tedious and boring checks of the planes, the missiles, and the \par
guns.  The Nimitz was preparing for war.  And then yesterday, the normal time \par
for such a drill to be called off, the captain had gathered all the officers \par
together and told them that he had received the order to attack at dawn.  \par
Winters' heart had skipped a beat as the commanding officer had briefed them on \par
the full scope of the American action against Libya\par
\tab Winters' last assignment, just after evening mess, had been to go over the \par
bombing targets with the pilots one more time.  Two separate planes were being \par
sent to bomb the residence where Gaddafi was supposedly sleeping.  One of the \par
two chosen pilots was outwardly ecstatic; he realized that he had been given the \par
prime target of the raid.  The other pilot, Lieutenant Gibson from Oregon, was \par
quiet but thorough in his preparations.  He kept looking at the map with Winters \par
and going over the Libyan gun emplacements.  Gibson also complained that his \par
mouth was dry and drank several glasses of water.\par
\tab "Shit, Indiana, you know what's bothering me?  Those flyboys will be in \par
the battle and we'll be stuck here with no role unless the crazy A-rabs decide \par
to attack.  How can we get into the fight?  Wait.  I just had a thought."  \par
Lieutenant Hilliard was still talking nonstop.  It was after three o'clock and \par
they had already gone over everything associated with the attack at least twice.  \par
Winters was feeling lifeless and enervated from lack of sleep but the \par
astonishing Hilliard continued to exude exuberance.\par
\tab "What a great idea," Randy continued.  talking to himself.  "But we can do \par
it.  You briefed the pilots tonight, didn't you, so you know who's going after \par
what targets?"  Vernon nodded his head.  "Then that's it.  We'll tape a personal \par
'screw you' to the side of the missile that's going to get Gaddafi.  That way \par
part of us will go into battle."\par
\tab Vernon did not have the energy to dissuade Randy from his crazy plan.  As \par
the time for the attack drew closer, Lieutenants Winters and Hilliard went into \par
the hangar on the Nimitz and found the airplane assigned to Lieutenant Gibson \par
(Winters never knew why, but he immediately assumed it would be Gibson who would \par
score a missile on the Gaddafi enclave).  Laughingly, Randy explained to the \par
fresh ensign on watch what he and Vernon were going to try to do.  It took them \par
almost half an hour to locate the right plane and then identify the missile that \par
would be the first to be launched against the Gaddafi household.\par
\tab The two lieutenants argued for almost ten minutes about the message they \par
were going to write on the paper that would be taped on the missile.  Winters \par
wanted something deep, almost philosophical, like "Such is the just end to the \par
tyranny of terrorism.  "Hilliard argued persuasively that Winters' concept was \par
too obscure.  At length a tired Lieutenant Winters assented to the visceral \par
communication written by his friend.  "DIE, MOTHERFUCKER," was the message the \par
two lieutenants inscribed on the side of the missile.\par
\tab Winters returned to his bunk exhausted.  Tired and still a little \par
unsettled by the magnitude of the coming day's events, he pulled out his \par
personal Bible to read a few verses.  There was no comfort in the good book for \par
the Presbyterian from Indiana.  He tried praying, generic prayers at first and \par
then more specific, as had been his custom during critical moments in his life.  \par
He asked for the Lord to guard his wife and son and to be with him in this \par
moment of travail.  And then, quickly and without thinking, Lieutenant Vernon \par
Winters asked God to rain down terror in the form of the missile with the taped \par
message on Colonel Gaddafi and all his family.\par
\tab Eight years later, sitting in his office at the U.S.  Naval Air Station in \par
Key West, Commander Winters would remember that prayer and cringe inside.  Even \par
then, in 1986, just after he finished the prayer, he had felt weird and \par
disoriented, almost as if he had somehow committed a blasphemy and displeased \par
the Lord.  A brief hour of sleep that followed was torturous, full of dreams of \par
hideous gargoyles and vampires.  He watched the planes leave the carrier the \par
next morning at dawn in a dreamlike trance.  His mouth had a bitter metal taste \par
when he mechanically shook Gibson's hand and wished him luck.\par
\tab For all those years Winters had wished that he could have rescinded that \par
prayer.  He was convinced that God had permitted that particular missile carried \par
by Gibson to take the life of Gaddafi's infant daughter just to teach Winters a \par
personal lesson.  On that day, he thought as he sat in his office on a Thursday \par
in March 1994, I committed sacrilege and violated Your trust.  I overstepped my \par
bound and lost my privileged position in Your sanctuary.  I have asked for \par
forgiveness many times since then but it has not been forthcoming.  How much \par
longer must I wait?\par

\par
VERNON Allen Winters was born on June 25, 1950, the day that the North Koreans \par
invaded South Korea.  He was reminded of the significance of his birthdate \par
throughout his life by his father, Martin Winters, a man who was a hardworking, \par
deeply religious corn farmer in Indiana at the time Vernon was born.  When \par
Vernon was three years old and his sister Linda was six, the family moved off \par
the farm and into the town of Columbus, a white, middle-class town of thirty \par
thousand or so in south central Indiana.  Vernon's mother had felt isolated out \par
on the farm.  particularly during the winter, and wanted more company.  The \par
Winters' farm provided a nice cash profit.  Mr. Winters, by now almost forty, \par
put most of the nest egg aside as security for a rainy day and became a banker.\par
\tab Martin Winters was proud to be an American.  Whenever Mr. Winters would \par
tell Vernon about the day of his birth, the story would inevitably center around \par
the news of the start of the Korean War and how it was explained to the nation \par
by President Harry Truman.  "I thought that day," Mr. Winters would say, "that \par
it was surely no coincidence.  The good Lord brought you to us that special day \par
because of his purpose for you.  And I bet he meant for you to be a protector of \par
this wonderful country we have created .  .  ."  Later banker Winters would \par
always see to it that the Army-Navy football game was one of the key events of \par
the year and he would tell his friends, particularly when it became obvious that \par
young Vernon was a good student, that "the boy is still trying to choose which \par
of the academies to attend."  Vernon was never asked.\par
\tab The Winters family lived a simple Midwestern life.  Mr. Winters was \par
moderately successful, eventually becoming the senior vice-president of the \par
largest bank in Columbus.  The family's chief social activity was church.  They \par
were Presbyterians and spent almost all day Sunday at the church.  Mrs. Winters \par
ran the Sunday school.  Mr. Winters was a deacon and voluntarily managed the \par
church finances.  Vernon and Linda helped supervise the smaller children at \par
Sunday school and were responsible for the special Bible displays on the \par
bulletin boards in the kindergarten and primary school rooms.\par
\tab During the week Mrs. Winters sewed and watched soap operas and sometimes \par
played bridge with friends.  She never worked outside the home.  Her husband and \par
her children were her job.  She was an attentive, patient parent who deeply \par
cared for her children and tirelessly chauffeured them to their many activities \par
throughout their years of adolescence.\par
\tab Vernon played all sports in high school, football and basketball because \par
it was expected of him, baseball because he loved it.  He was above average at \par
all sports, not outstanding at anything.  "Activities are important, \par
particularly sports," banker Winters often told him approvingly.  "The academies \par
look at much more than your grades " The only significant decision that Vernon \par
had to make in the first eighteen years of his life was which of the service \par
academies he preferred.  (Mr. Winters, being cautious, was prepared politically \par
to secure a nomination for Vernon to any of the academies.  He strongly urged \par
Vernon to think about applying to all three just in case.) In his junior year at \par
Columbus High School, Vernon took the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and made \par
such a high score that it was obvious he would be able to pick his own favorite.  \par
He chose Annapolis and was not questioned about the reasons.  If he had been, he \par
would have answered that he just liked the idea of himself in a Navy uniform.\par
\tab Vernon's teenage years were remarkably linear, particularly considering \par
that they occurred at a time of great social turmoil in the United States.  The \par
Winters family prayed together for hours after the Kennedy assassination, \par
worried about local boys in the Vietnam War, remarked with concern when three \par
prominent high school seniors refused to cut their hair and were expelled from \par
school, and attended a couple of church-sponsored meetings on the evils of \par
marijuana.  But all these anxieties were outside the daily harmony of the \par
Winters family.  Music by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones did penetrate the \par
controlled Winters culture, of course, and even some of the protest songs sung \par
by Bob Dylan and Joan Baez were played on Vernon's stereo.  But neither Vernon \par
nor his sister Linda paid much serious attention to the lyrics.\par
\tab It was an easy existence.  Vernon's closest friends were all from families \par
like his.  Mothers did not work, fathers were bankers or lawyers or businessmen, \par
almost all were Republicans (but a patriotic Democrat was accepted) and believed \par
fervently in God, country, and the entire litany that ends in apple pie.  Vernon \par
was a "good kid," even an "exceptional kid," who first drew attention to himself \par
by his performances in the annual church pageants at Christmas and Easter.  The \par
pastor of their church was a great believer that reenactment of the birth and \par
crucifixion of Christ, performed by the children of the town, was a powerful way \par
to reconfirm the faith of the local citizenry.  And Reverend Pendleton was \par
correct.  The Columbus Presbyterian Church pageants were one of the highlights \par
of the local year.  When the church congregation and their friends saw their own \par
children acting in the roles of Joseph, Mary, and even Christ, they became \par
involved in the depicted events at an emotional level that was virtually \par
impossible to achieve in any other way.\par
\tab Reverend Pendleton had two casts for each pageant, so that more children \par
could participate, but Vernon was always the star.  When he was eleven years old \par
Vernon first portrayed Christ in the Easter pageant and it was mentioned in the \par
religious column of the Columbus newspaper that his tortured dragging of the \par
cross had "captured all of man's suffering."  He was Joseph at Christmas and \par
Jesus at Easter for four years running, before he became too old and therefore \par
no longer eligible for the pageants.  The last two years, when Vernon was \par
thirteen and fourteen, the role of the Virgin Mary in the  "A" cast was played \par
by the pastor's daughter, Betty Vernon and Betty were together quite often while \par
rehearsing and both families were delighted.  All four parents made no secret of \par
the fact that they would generously approve if, "assuming God wills it," the \par
Vernon-Betty friendship would eventually mature into something more permanent.\par
\tab Vernon loved the attention he received from the pageants.  Although Betty \par
was touched deeply by the religious aspects of their performances (she remained \par
truly devoted to God, without wavering, through everything in her life), \par
Vernon's joy was standing by his proud parents after each performance and \par
soaking up the praise.  In high school he gravitated naturally toward the small \par
drama activity and was the lead in the school play every year.  His mother \par
supported this over his father's mild objections ("After all, dear," she would \par
say, "I don't think anyone is really going to think Vernon's a sissy when he's \par
playing three sports.") and because she also vicariously enjoyed the applause.\par
\tab During the summer of 1968, just before he entered Annapolis, Vernon worked \par
in his uncle's cornfields.  Only a little more than a hundred miles away there \par
were riots at the Democratic Convention in Chicago, but in Columbus Vernon spent \par
his summer evenings with Betty, talking with chums and drinking root beer at the \par
A & W Drive-in.  Mr. and Mrs. Winters played miniature golf or canasta with \par
Vernon and Betty from time to time.  They were delighted and proud to have "good \par
clean kids" who were not hippies or drug victims.  All in all, Vernon's last \par
summer in Indiana was ordered, constrained, and very pleasant.\par
\tab As expected, he was a model student at Annapolis.  He studied hard, obeyed \par
all the rules, learned what his professors taught him, and dreamed of being the \par
commander of an aircraft carrier or a nuclear submarine.  He was not outgoing \par
for the big-city boys seemed way too sophisticated for him and he did not always \par
feel comfortable when they talked about sex so casually.  He was a virgin and he \par
was not ashamed of it.  He just didn't feel the need to broadcast it around the \par
U.S. Naval Academy.  He had a couple of dates a month, nothing special, just \par
when the occasion called for it.  After a blind date early his junior year with \par
Joanna Carr, a cheerleader at the University of Maryland, he took her out \par
several more times.  She was vivacious, lovely, fun, and modem.  She drew out \par
the best in Vernon, made him laugh and even relax.  She was his date for the \par
weekend of the Army-Navy game in Philadelphia.\par
\tab (During his entire time at the Academy, Vernon went home every summer and \par
every Christmas to Indiana.  He always saw Betty Pendleton when he was home.  \par
Betty graduated from high school and entered a nearby state college to study \par
education.  Once or twice a year, on special occasions such as the anniversary \par
of their first kiss or New Year's Eve, Betty and he would celebrate, in a sense, \par
by doing a little something intimate.  Like controlled petting [outside only] or \par
kissing lying down.  Neither of them ever suggested any variation in this well-\par
established routine.)\par
\tab Vernon and Joanna were joined for the weekend by another midshipman, the \par
closest acquaintance that Vernon had at Navy who was still not quite what one \par
would call a friend, Duane Eller, and his date from Columbia, an extremely loud \par
and pushy girl named Edith.  Vernon had never spent much time around a New York \par
City girl and he found Edith absolutely obnoxious.  Edith was violently anti-\par
Nixon and anti-Vietnam and seemed, despite the fact that her date for the \par
weekend was going to be a military officer, anti-military as well.  The original \par
plan for the weekend had been decidedly proper, even backward given that it was \par
1970 and casual intercourse was not unusual on college campuses.  Vernon and \par
Duane were to share one motel room and the two girls were to share another.  \par
Over a pizza dinner the night before the game, Edith frequently insulted Joanna \par
and Vernon both ("Miss Betty Crocker-Go-Team-Go" and "Onward Christian Soldiers, \par
God's on Our Side") and Duane did nothing to intercede.  Seeing that Edith was \par
annoying Joanna, Vernon suggested to Joanna that it might be easier if the two \par
of them shared a room instead of following the original game plan.  She readily \par
agreed.\par
\tab Vernon had made no sexual moves on Joanna on the four or five dates that \par
they had had together.  He had been attentive, had kissed her good night a \par
couple of times, and had held her hand most of the evening on their last date.  \par
Everything had always been extremely proper, but there had never actually been \par
any opportunity for intimacy.  So Joanna really didn't know what to expect.  She \par
liked this handsome Hoosier midshipman and had thought, a couple of times, about \par
the possibility of the involvement developing into something serious.  But \par
Vernon was not yet anyone "super special" for her.\par
\tab Just after they made the room change (which a drunken Edith made more \par
difficult by embarrassing them and herself with lewd comments), Vernon very \par
carefully apologized to Joanna and told her that he would sleep in the car if \par
she were offended.  The room was a typical Holiday Inn room with two double \par
beds.  Joanna laughed.  "I know you didn't plan this," she said.  "If I need \par
protection, I can order you to your bed."  The first night they enjoyed watching \par
television and drinking more beer in the room.  They both felt a little awkward.  \par
At bedtime they shared a couple of almost passionate kisses, laughed together, \par
and then went to separate beds.\par
\tab The next evening, after the postgame dance sponsored by the Naval Academy \par
at a downtown Philadelphia hotel, Joanna and Vernon returned to their room at \par
the Holiday Inn just before midnight.  They had already changed into their jeans \par
and Vernon was brushing his teeth when there was a knock on their door.  Joanna \par
opened the door and Duane Eller was standing there, a gigantic shit-eating grin \par
on his face and his hand clenched around some small object.  "This stuff is \par
fuckin' fantastic," he said, thrusting a joint into Joanna's hand.  "You've just \par
got to try it."  Duane withdrew quickly with a wild smile.\par
\tab Joanna was a bright young woman.  But it did not occur to her that her \par
date had never even seen a joint, much less smoked one.  She herself had smoked \par
marijuana maybe a dozen times over a four-year period, beginning in her junior \par
year in high school.  She liked it, if the situation and the company were right; \par
she avoided it when she couldn't have control of her environment.  But she had \par
enjoyed the weekend with Vernon and she thought this might be a perfect way to \par
loosen him up a little.\par
\tab Under almost any circumstances Vernon would have said no to any offer of \par
marijuana, not just because he was against all drugs, but also because he would \par
have been terrified that somehow he would be discovered and eventually thrown \par
out of Annapolis.  But here was his lovely date, a mainstream American \par
cheerleader from Maryland, and she had just lit a joint and offered it to him.  \par
Joanna quickly saw that he was a grass neophyte.  She showed him how to inhale \par
and hold in the smoke, how not to bogart the joint, and eventually how to use a \par
roach clip (one of her hairpins) to finish it off.  Vernon had expected to feel \par
as if he were drunk.  He was astonished to find that he felt more alert.  Much \par
to his own surprise, he began reciting e.e. cummings poems he had been studying \par
in Lit.  And then he and Joanna began to laugh.  They laughed at everything.  At \par
Edith, football, the Naval Academy, their parents, even Vietnam.  They laughed \par
until they were almost crying.\par
\tab An overpowering hunger attacked Vernon and Joanna.  They put on their \par
jackets and walked out into the cold December air to find something to eat.  Arm \par
in arm they paraded down the suburban parkway, finding a convenience store that \par
was still open about a half mile from their motel.  They bought Cokes and potato \par
chips and Fritos and, much to Vernon's astonishment, a package of Ding Dongs.  \par
Joanna opened the potato chips while they were still in the store.  She put one \par
in Vernon's mouth and they "Mmmed" while the checkout clerk laughed with them.\par
\tab Vernon could not believe the taste of the chips.  He ate the entire bag \par
while they were walking back to their room.  When he was finished, Vernon burst \par
spontaneously into song, singing "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" by the Beatles.  \par
Joanna joined in vigorously on the "Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer came \par
down upon his head .  .  ."  She reached up with the side of her fist and \par
playfully banged on the top of his head. Vernon felt jaunty, liberated, as if he \par
had known Joanna forever.  He put his arm around her and kissed her \par
ostentatiously as they turned into the driveway leading to their motel.\par
\tab They sat on the floor with all their munchies spread out in front of them.  \par
Vernon turned on the radio.  It was tuned to a classical station in the middle \par
of a symphony.  Vernon was mesmerized by the sound.  For the first time in his \par
life, Vernon could actually hear the individual instruments of the orchestra in \par
his head.  He visualized a stage and saw the musicians pulling their bows across \par
the violins.  He was fascinated and excited.  Vernon told Joanna that all his \par
senses were alive.\par
\tab To Joanna Carr, it seemed that Vernon was finally opening up.  When he \par
leaned over to kiss her, she was more than willing.  They kissed sweetly but \par
deeply several times while the symphony was playing.  During a momentary break \par
for some more munchies, Joanna tuned the radio to a rock and roll station.  The \par
music changed the pace in their necking.  Driving, jangling sounds increased the \par
tempo and their kisses became more passionate.  In his ardor Vernon pushed \par
Joanna down on the floor and they kissed over and over again as they lay side by \par
side, still fully clothed.  They became enthralled by the strength of their \par
arousal.\par
\tab The radio now started playing "Light My Fire" by the Doors.  And Vernon \par
Allen Winters of Columbus, Indiana, third-year midshipman at the U S.  Naval \par
Academy, was no longer a virgin by the time the long song was over.  "The time \par
to hesitate is through, no time to wallow in the mire, try now you can only \par
lose, and our love become a funeral pyre .  .  .  Come on baby, light my fire .  \par
.  .  Come on baby, light my fire."  Vernon had never lost control of himself \par
before in his entire life.  But when Joanna stroked the outline of his swollen \par
penis underneath his jeans, it was as if a giant wall of steel and concrete \par
suddenly gave way.  Years later, Vernon would still marvel at the raw passion he \par
showed for two, maybe three minutes.  The combination of Joanna's insistent \par
kisses, the grass, and the driving rhythms of the music pushed him over the \par
edge.  He was an animal.  Still on the floor of the motel room, he pulled \par
vigorously on Joanna's slacks several times, nearly tearing them as he managed \par
to free them from her hips.  Her underpants half followed the slacks.  Vernon \par
grabbed them roughly and pulled them down the rest of the way while he was \par
squirming out of his own jeans.\par
\tab Joanna tried in a quiet voice to slow Vernon down, to suggest that maybe \par
the bed would be better.  Or at least it would be more pleasant if they actually \par
took off their shoes and socks and didn't make love with their pants around \par
their ankles restricting their movement.  But Vernon was gone.  Years of \par
restraint left him no ability to deal with his own surging desire.  He was \par
possessed.  He crawled on top of Joanna, a look of frightening seriousness on \par
his face.  For the first time she was scared and her sudden fear heightened her \par
sexual excitement.  Vernon struggled for a few seconds (the music was now in the \par
frenzied instrumental part of "Light My Fire") to find the right spot and then \par
entered her abruptly and forcefully.  Joanna felt him drive once, twice, and \par
then shudder all over.  He was done in maybe ten seconds.  She intuitively knew \par
that it had been his first time and the pleasure of that knowledge outweighed \par
her bruised feelings about his lack of finesse and gentleness.\par
\tab Vernon said nothing and quickly fell asleep on the floor next to Joanna.  \par
She gamely went to the bed, pulled the bed-spread off, cuddled into Vernon's \par
arms on the floor, and wrapped the spread around them.  She smiled to herself \par
and drifted off to sleep, still a little puzzled by this Hoosier lying next to \par
her.  But she knew that they were now special to each other.\par
\tab How special Joanna would never really know.  When Vernon woke up in the \par
middle of the night, he felt an over-powering sense of guilt.  He could not \par
believe that he had smoked dope and then virtually raped a girl he hardly knew.  \par
He had lost control.  He had been unable to stop what he was doing and had \par
clearly crossed the bounds of propriety.  He winced when he thought about what \par
his parents (or worse, Betty and Reverend Pendleton) would think about him if \par
they could have seen what he had done.  Then the guilt gave way to fear.  Vernon \par
imagined that Joanna was pregnant, that he had to leave Annapolis and marry her \par
(What would he do?  What kind of job would he have if he were not a naval \par
officer?), that he had to explain all this to his parents and to the Pendletons.  \par
Worse still, he next imagined that at any minute the motel would be raided and \par
the police would find the butt of the joint in the roach clip.  He would first \par
be kicked out of the Academy for drug abuse, then find out that he had made a \par
girl pregnant.\par
\tab Vernon Winters was now really scared.  Lying on the floor of a motel room \par
on the outskirts of Philadelphia at three o'clock on a Sunday morning, he began \par
to pray in earnest.  "Dear God," Vernon Winters prayed, asking for something \par
specific for himself for the first time since he asked God to help him on the \par
day that he took the SATs, "let me get out of this without harm and I will \par
become the most perfectly disciplined naval officer that You have ever seen.  I \par
will dedicate my life to defending this country that honors You.  Just please \par
help me."\par
\tab Eventually Vernon managed to fall asleep again.  But his sleep was fitful \par
and disturbed by vivid dreams.  In one dream Vernon was dressed in his \par
midshipman's uniform but was on stage back at the Columbus Presbyterian Church.  \par
It was the Easter pageant and he was again Christ, dragging the cross to \par
Calvary.  The sharp edge of the cross on his shoulder was cutting through his \par
uniform shirt and Vernon was aware of anxiety that he might not pass inspection.  \par
He stumbled and fell, the cross cut deeper through the uniform as he had feared \par
and he could see some blood running down his arm.  "Crucify him," Vernon heard \par
someone shout in the dream.  "Crucify him," a group of people in the audience \par
shouted together as Vernon tried vainly to see through the klieg lights.  He \par
woke up sweating.  For a couple of moments he was disoriented.  Then again his \par
emotions went the cycle from disgust to depression to fear as he played through \par
the events of the night before.\par
\tab Joanna was tender and affectionate after she woke up but Vernon was very \par
distant.  He explained his attitude by saying he was worried about his coming \par
exams.  A couple of times Joanna started to talk about what had happened the \par
night before, but each time he rapidly changed the subject.  Vernon suffered \par
through brunch and the drive back to College Park to Joanna's sorority house.  \par
Joanna tried to kiss him meaningfully when they parted but Vernon did not \par
reciprocate.  He was in a hurry to forget the entire weekend.  Back in the \par
privacy of his own room in Annapolis, he contritely bargained again with God to \par
let him escape unscathed.\par
\tab Midshipman Vernon Winters was true to his word.  He not only never talked \par
to Joanna Carr again (she called and failed to reach him a couple of times, sent \par
two letters that were unanswered, and then gave up), he also gave up dating \par
altogether during his final eighteen months at Annapolis.  He worked very hard \par
on his studies and attended chapel, as he had promised God, twice each week.\par
\tab He graduated with honors and did his initial tour of duty on a large \par
aircraft carrier.  Two years later, in June of 1974, after Betty Pendleton had \par
completed college and obtained her teacher's certificate, Vernon married her in \par
the Columbus Presbyterian Church where they had played Joseph and Mary a dozen \par
years earlier.  They moved to Norfolk, Virginia, and Vernon believed that the \par
pattern of his life was set.  His life would be going out to sea for long \par
stretches and then coming home for short stays with Betty and any children they \par
might have.\par
\tab Vernon regularly thanked God for keeping up His part of the bargain and he \par
dedicated himself to being the finest officer in the U.S.  Navy.  All of his \par
fitness reports praised his dependability and thoroughness.  His commanding \par
officers openly told him that he was admiral material.  Until Libya.  Or more \par
specifically, until he returned home after the Libyan action.  For the entire \par
world changed for Vernon Allen Winters during the few weeks after the American \par
attack against Gaddafi.\par

\par
CAROL and Troy were sitting in deck chairs at the front of the Florida Queen.  \par
They were facing forward in the boat, toward the ocean and the warm afternoon \par
sun.  Carol had removed her purple blouse to reveal the top of a one-piece blue \par
bathing suit, but she was still wearing her white cotton slacks.  Troy was \par
shirtless in a white surfing outfit that came quite a way down his beautiful \par
black legs.  His body was lean and sinewy, clearly fit but not overly muscled.  \par
They were talking casually and animatedly, laughing often in an easy way.  \par
Behind them underneath the canopy, Nick Williams was reading A Fan's Notes by \par
Fred Exley.  Every now and then he would look up at the other two for a few \par
moments and then return to his book.\par
\tab "So why didn't you ever go to college?"  Carol was asking Troy.  "You \par
clearly had the ability.  You would have made a fantastic engineer."\par
\tab Troy stood up, took off his sunglasses, and walked to the railing.  "My \par
brother, Jamie, said the same thing," he said slowly, staring out at the quiet \par
ocean.  "But I was just too wild.  When I finally did graduate from high school, \par
I was hungry to know what the world was like.  So I took off.  I wandered all \par
over the U.S.  and Canada for a couple of years."\par
\tab "Was that when you learned about electronics?"  Carol asked.  She checked \par
her watch to see what time it was.\par
\tab "That was later, much later," said Troy, remembering.  "Those two years of \par
wandering I didn't learn anything except how to survive on my wits.  Plus what \par
it was like to be a black boy in a white man's world."  He looked at Carol.  \par
There was no noticeable reaction.\par
\tab "I must have had a hundred different jobs," he continued, looking back at \par
the ocean, "I was a cook, a copyboy, a bartender, a construction worker.  I even \par
taught swimming lessons in a private club.  I was a bellman in a resort hotel, a \par
greenskeeper for a country club .  .  ."  Troy laughed and turned again to see \par
if Carol was paying attention.  "But I guess you're not interested in all this .  \par
.  ."\par
\tab "Sure I am," Carol said, "it's fascinating to me.  I'm trying to imagine \par
what you looked like in a hotel uniform.  And if Chief Nick is right, we still \par
have another ten minutes to pass until we reach where we're going."  She dropped \par
her voice.  "At least you talk.  The professor is not exactly social."\par
\tab "Being a black bellhop at a southern Mississippi resort hotel was an \par
amazing learning experience," Troy began, a smile spreading across his face.  \par
Troy loved to tell stories about his life.  It always placed him center stage.  \par
"Imagine, angel, I'm eighteen years old and I luck into a job at the grand old \par
Gulfport Inn, right on the beach.  Room and board plus tips.  I'm on top of the \par
world.  At least until the chief bellman, an impossible little man named Fish, \par
takes me out to the barracks where all the bellhops and kitchen staff live and \par
introduces me to everybody as the 'new nigger bellhop.'  From bits of discussion \par
I can tell that the hotel is in some kind of trouble because of possible racial \par
discrimination and hiring me is part of their response.\par
\tab "My room in the barracks was right behind the twelfth green on the golf \par
course.  A small bunk bed, a dresser built into the wall, a desk or table with a \par
portable lamp, a sink to brush my teeth and wash my face \emdash  that's where I lived \par
for six weeks.  Down at the other end of the building was the great community \par
bathroom that everyone left whenever I showed up.\par
\tab "In my high school in Miami virtually the entire student body was Cuban or \par
black or both.  So I knew almost nothing about white people.  From books and \par
television I had this fantasy image of whites as handsome, competent, educated, \par
and rich.  Ha.  My fantasy quickly vanished.  You would not have believed the \par
crew that worked in that hotel.  The head bellman Fish smoked dope every night \par
with his sixteen-year-old son Danny and dreamed of the day he would find a \par
million dollars left in somebody's room.  His only other goal in life was to \par
continue screwing the chef's wife, Marie, in the supply closet every morning \par
until he died.\par
\tab "One of the other bellmen was a poor, lonely soul whose real name was \par
Saint John because his brilliant parents thought that 'Saint' was a given name.  \par
He had only six teeth, wore thick glasses, and had a giant tumor underneath his \par
left eye.  Saint John knew that he was ugly and he worried all the time about \par
losing his job because of his personal appearance.  So Fish exploited him \par
unmercifully by giving him all the shittiest assignments and forcing him to pay \par
kickbacks with a portion of his tips.  The other bellmen also ridiculed Saint \par
John at every opportunity and made him the butt of their practical jokes.\par
\tab "One night I was sitting quietly in my room reading a book when there was \par
a soft knock on the door.  When I answered it, Saint John was standing there.  \par
He looked confused and distracted.  He was holding a small game box in one hand \par
and a six-pack of beer in the other.  I waited a few moments and then asked him \par
what he wanted.  He looked nervously in both directions and then asked me if I \par
knew how to play chess.  When I told him yes and added that I would enjoy a \par
game, Saint John grinned from ear to ear and mumbled something about being glad \par
that he had taken a chance.  I invited him in and we played and talked and drank \par
beer for almost two hours.  He was one of nine children from a poor, rural \par
Mississippi family.  While we were playing, Saint John casually let slip that he \par
had been a little reluctant to ask me to play because Fish and Miller had told \par
him that niggers were too dumb to play chess.\par
\tab Saint John and I became friends, at least sort of, for the few more weeks \par
that I stayed there.  We were united by the deepest of bonds, we were both \par
outsiders in that strange social structure created by the employees of the \par
Gulfport Inn.  It was from Saint John that I learned about the many \par
misconceptions that Southern whites have about blacks."  Troy laughed.  "You \par
know, one night Saint John actually followed me to the bath-room to verify with \par
his own eyes that I was not significantly larger than he was."\par
\tab Troy returned to his deck chair and looked at Carol.  She was smiling.  It \par
was hard not to enjoy Troy's stories.  He told them with such enthusiasm and \par
self-involved charm.  Under the canopy Nick also had put his book aside and was \par
listening to the conversation.\par
\tab "Then there was this giant Farrell, early twenties, who looked like Elvis \par
Presley.  He supplied liquor to the guests at cut rates, operated an escort \par
service on call, and took excess hotel goods to sell at his sister's market.  He \par
rented part of my room to store some of the liquor.  What a character.  After \par
big convention breakfasts Farrell would pour the leftover orange juice in the \par
pitchers into bottles and keep it for resale.  One morning the hotel manager \par
found a case of the juice temporarily sitting in a room off the lobby and \par
demanded to know what was going on.  Farrell grabbed me and took me out front.  \par
He told me that he wanted to make a deal.  If I would acknowledge that I had \par
taken the juice, Farrell would pay me twenty dollars.  He explained that if I \par
confessed, nothing would happen to me, because niggers were expected to steal.  \par
But if he Farrell were caught, he would lose his job .  .  ."\par
\tab Nick came out from under the canopy.  "I hate to break this up," he said, \par
a little sarcastic edge in his voice, "but according to our computer navigator, \par
we are now at the south edge of the region on the map." He handed the map back \par
to Carol.\par
\tab "Thanks, Professor," Troy laughed, "I believe you saved Carol from being \par
talked to death." He walked over to where all the monitoring equipment had been \par
set up on the footlocker next to the canopy.  He turned on the power supply.  \par
"Hey, angel, you want to tell me now how this all works?"\par
\tab Dale Michaels' ocean telescope was programmed to take three virtually \par
simultaneous pictures at each fixed setting.  The first of the pictures was a \par
normal visible image, the second was the same field of view photographed at \par
infrared wavelengths, and the third was a composite sonar image of the same \par
frame.  The sonar subsystem did not produce crisp pictures, only outlines of \par
objects.  However, it probed to greater depths than either the visible or \par
infrared elements of the telescope and could be used even when the water \par
underneath the boat was murky.\par
\tab Affixed to the bottom of almost any boat, the compact telescope could be \par
driven thirty degrees back and forth about the vertical by a small internal \par
motor.  The observation schedule for the telescope was usually defined by a \par
preprogrammed protocol.  The details of this sequence as well as the critical \par
optical parameters for the telescope were all stored in the system \par
microprocessor; however, everything in the software could be changed in realtime \par
by manual input if the operator desired.\par
\tab Data from the telescope was carried to the rest of the electronic \par
equipment on the boat by means of very thin fiber optics.  These cables were \par
bracketed along the edge of the boat.  About ten percent of the pictures \par
reconstructed from this data were then displayed (after some very crude \par
enhancements) on the boat's monitor in realtime.  But all the data taken by the \par
telescope was automatically recorded in the one hundred gigabit memory unit that \par
adjoined the monitor.  Another set of fiber optics connected the same memory \par
unit with the boat's central navigation system and the servomotor actuators \par
controlling the telescopes.  These circuits were pulsed every ten milliseconds \par
so that the orientation of the telescope and the boat's location at the time of \par
each telescope image could be stored together in the permanent file.\par
\tab Next to the monitor on top of the footlocker, but on the other side from \par
the memory unit, was the system control panel.  Dr. Dale Michaels and MOI were \par
famous throughout the world for the cleverness of their inventions; however, \par
these ingenious creations were not so easy to operate.  Dale had tried to give \par
Carol a crash course on the workings of the system the night before she had \par
driven down to Key West from Miami.  It had been almost useless.  Eventually \par
frustrated, Dale had simply programmed into the microprocessor an easy sequence \par
that mosaicked the area under the boat in regular patterns.  He then set the \par
optical gains at normal default values, and instructed Carol not to change \par
anything.  "All you have to do," Dr. Michaels had said as he had carefully \par
loaded the system control panel into the station wagon, "is push this GO button.  \par
Then cover the panel to make certain that nobody inadvertently hits the wrong \par
command."\par
\tab So Carol certainly could not explain to Troy how anything worked.  She \par
walked over beside him on the boat, put her arm on his shoulder, and grinned \par
sheepishly.  "I hate to disappoint you, my inquisitive friend, but I don't know \par
any more about how this thing works than I told you when we were setting up all \par
the equipment.  To operate it, all we have to do is turn on the power supply, \par
which you have already done, and then push this button." She pushed the GO \par
button on the panel.  A picture of the clear ocean about fifty feet underneath \par
the boat appeared immediately on the color monitor.  The picture was amazingly \par
sharp.  The threesome watched in wonder as a hammerhead shark swam through a \par
school of small gray fish, swallowing hundreds of them in his awesome rush.\par
\tab "As I understand it," Carol continued as both men stayed glued in \par
fascination to the monitor, "the telescope system then does the rest, following \par
a planned set of observations stored in its software.  Obviously we see what it \par
sees here on this monitor.  At least we see the visual image.  The simultaneous \par
infrared and sonar pictures are stored on the recorder.  My friend at MOI (she \par
didn't want to alert them even more by using Dale's name) tried to explain how I \par
could change between the visual and infrared and sonar images, but it wasn't \par
simple.  You'd think it would be as easy as pushing an "I" for infrared or an \par
"S" for sonar.  Nope.  You have to input as many as a dozen commands just to \par
change which output signal is fed into the monitor."\par
\tab Troy was impressed.  Not just by the ocean telescope system, but also by \par
the way Carol, a woman admittedly not educated in engineering or electronics, \par
had clearly grasped the essentials of it.  "The infrared part of the telescope \par
must measure thermal radiation," he said slowly, "if I remember my high school \par
physics correctly.  But how would underwater thermal variations tell you \par
anything about whales?"\par
\tab At this point Nick Williams shook his head and turned away from the \par
screen.  He recognized that he was hopelessly out of his intellectual element \par
with all these engineering terms and he was more than a little embarrassed to \par
admit his total ignorance in front of Carol and Troy.  Nick also didn't believe \par
for an instant that Carol had brought all this electronic wizardry on board to \par
find whales that had strayed from their migration route.  He walked over to the \par
small refrigerator and pulled out another beer.  "And what we're going to do for \par
the next two hours, if I understand it correctly, is ride around in the boat \par
while you look for whales on that screen?"\par
\tab Nick's derisive comment carried with it an unmistakable challenge.  It \par
intruded upon the warm and friendly rapport that had been created between Carol \par
and Troy.  She allowed herself to become irritated again by Nick's attitude and \par
fired back her own verbal fusillade.  "That was the plan, Mister Williams, as I \par
told you when we left Key West.  But Troy tells me that you're something of a \par
treasure hunter.  Or at least were some years ago.  And since you seem to have \par
convinced yourself that treasure is really what I'm after, perhaps you'd like to \par
sit here next to me and look at the same pictures to make sure I don't miss any \par
whales.  Or treasure, as the case may be."\par
\tab Nick and Carol glared at each other for a few moments. Then Troy stepped \par
between them.  "Look, Professor .  .  .  and you too, angel .  .  .  I don't \par
pretend to understand why you two insist on pissing each other off.  But it's a \par
pain in the ass for me.  Can't you just cool it for a while?  After all," Troy \par
added, looking first at Nick and then at Carol, "if you two go for a dive, \par
you're partners.  Your lives may depend on one another.  So knock it off."\par
\tab Carol shrugged her shoulders and nodded.  "Okay by me," she said.  But \par
seeing no immediate response from Nick, she couldn't resist another shot.  \par
"Provided that Mr. Williams recognizes his responsibility as a PADI member and \par
stays sober enough to dive."\par
\tab Nick's eyes flashed angrily.  Then he walked over to the deck railing and \par
dramatically poured his new beer into the ocean.  "Don't worry about me, \par
sweetheart," he said, forcing a smile, "I can take care of myself.  You just \par
worry about what you do."\par
\par
\tab The ocean telescope microprocessor contained a special alarm subroutine \par
that sounded a noise like a telephone ring whenever the programmed alarm \par
conditions were triggered.  At Carol's request, Dale Michaels had personally \par
adapted the normal alarming algorithm just before she left for Key West so that \par
it would react to either a large creature moving across the field of view or a \par
stationary "unknown" object of significant size.  After he had finished the \par
logic design for the small change and sent it to his software department for top \par
priority coding and testing, Dale had smiled to himself.  He was amused by his \par
complicity with Carol.  This piece of technological subterfuge would certainly \par
convince Carol's companions, whoever they might be, that she was earnest in her \par
search for whales.  At the same time, the alarm would also sound if what Carol \par
was really seeking, supposedly an errant (and secret) Navy missile currently \par
under development, appeared on the ocean floor underneath the boat.\par
\tab The basic structure for both alarm algorithms was easy to understand.  To \par
identify a moving animal, it was sufficient to overlay two or three images taken \par
less than a second apart (at any wavelength, although there was greater accuracy \par
in the process with the sharper visual images), and then compare the data using \par
the knowledge that most of the scene should be unchanged.  Significant \par
miscompares (connected areas in the overlay that differed from image to image) \par
would suggest the presence of a large moving creature.\par
\tab To identify foreign objects in the field of view, the alarm algorithm took \par
advantage of the tremendous storage capacity of the memory unit in the telescope \par
data processing system.  The near simultaneous infrared and visual images were \par
fed into the memory unit and then crudely analyzed against a data set that \par
contained chains of pattern recognition parameters over both wavelength regions.  \par
These pattern parameters had been developed through years of careful research \par
and had been recently expanded by MOI to include virtually everything normal \par
(plants, animals, reef structures, etc.) that might be seen on the ocean floor \par
around the Florida Keys.  Any large object that didn't correlate in realtime \par
with this existing data base would be flagged and the alarm would sound.\par
\tab The alarms made it unnecessary to sit patiently in front of the screen and \par
study the thousands of frames of data as they were received on the boat.  Even \par
Troy, a confessed "knowledge junkie" whose interest in everything was almost \par
insatiable, grew tired of staring at the monitor after about ten minutes, \par
particularly when the boat entered into deeper water and very little could be \par
seen in the visual images.\par
\tab A couple of solitary sharks triggered alarms and created momentary \par
excitement about twenty minutes after the telescope was activated, but a long \par
period void of any discoveries followed.  As the afternoon waned Nick became \par
more and more impatient.  "I don't know why I allowed myself to be talked into \par
this wild goose chase," he grumbled to nobody in particular.  "We could have \par
been preparing the boat for the weekend charter."\par
\tab Carol ignored Nick's comment and studied the map one more time.  They had \par
traversed from south to north the region she and Dale had defined and were now \par
moving slowly east along the northern periphery.  Dale had constructed the \par
search area based upon his own inferences from the questions asked him by the \par
Navy.  He probably could have pinned down the area of interest with greater \par
certainty with a few more questions of his own, but he hadn't wanted to arouse \par
any suspicions.\par
\tab Carol knew that the search was a little like finding a needle in a \par
haystack, but she had thought it would he worthwhile because of the potential \par
payoff.  If she could somehow find and photograph a secret Navy missile that had \par
crashed near a populated area .  .  .  What a scoop that would be!  But now she \par
too was growing a little impatient and it was hard for her to revive her earlier \par
excitement after the long afternoon in the sun.  They would have to head back to \par
Key West soon to ensure arrival by nightfall.  Oh well, she thought to herself \par
with resignation, at least I gave it a shot.  And as my father used to say, \par
nothing ventured, nothing gained.\par
\tab She was standing all the way at the prow of the boat when suddenly alarms \par
started coming from the memory unit next to the monitor.  One ring, then two, \par
followed by a brief silence.  A third ring then sounded and was rapidly joined \par
by a fourth.  Carol rushed excitedly toward the monitor.  "Stop the boat," she \par
shouted imperiously at Nick.  But she was too late.  By the time she reached the \par
monitor, the alarms had stopped and she could not see anything on the screen\par
\tab "Turn around, turn around," a frustrated Carol hollered immediately, not \par
noticing that Nick was again glaring at her.\par
\tab "Aye, aye, Cap-i-tan," Nick said, jerking on the wheel with such force \par
that Carol lost her balance.  The monitor and other electronic equipment started \par
to slide off their flimsy mountings on the top of the footlocker; they were \par
rescued at the last minute by Troy.  The Florida Queen veered sharply in the \par
water.  Despite the quietness of the ocean, a small wave came over the railing \par
on the low side of the deck, catching Carol from the knees down.  The bottom of \par
her cotton slacks were left clinging to her calves.  Her white tennis shoes and \par
socks were drenched.  Nick made no effort to hide his amusement.\par
\tab Carol was about to joust with him again when the renewed ringing of the \par
alarms diverted her attention.  Regaining her squishy footing as the boat \par
leveled off, she saw in the monitor that they were above a coral reef.  And deep \par
beneath the boat, barely discernible on the screen, were three whales of the \par
same kind that she had seen on the beach that morning at Deer Key.  They were \par
swimming together in what appeared to be an aimless pattern.  But there was \par
more.  The special alarm message code indicated that there was also a foreign \par
object in or near to the same field of view as the desultory whales.  Carol \par
could not contain her excitement.  She clapped her hands.  "Anchor, please," she \par
shouted, and then she laughed.  She saw that Troy had already thrown the anchor \par
overboard.\par
\par
\tab A few minutes later Carol was hurriedly putting on her buoyancy vest in \par
the aft portion of the boat behind the canopy.  Her mask and her flippers had \par
already been adjusted and were beside her on the deck.  Troy was helping her by \par
holding up the air bottle that was built into the back of the bulky vest.  \par
"Don't worry about Nick," Troy said.  "He may be grumpy today for some reason, \par
maybe because Harvard lost the basketball game, but he's a fabulous diver.  And \par
he has the reputation of being the best dive teacher in the Keys."  He grinned.  \par
"After all, he taught me a couple of months ago and we're not even supposed to \par
be able to swim."\par
\tab Carol smiled and shook her head at Troy.  "Don't you ever stop joking?" \par
she said.  She slid her free arm through the second opening and the vest fell \par
into place.  "By the way," she continued softly, "for an expert diver your \par
friend certainly uses antiquated equipment." At this moment she regretted her \par
decision to leave her customized diving vest in the station wagon.  She always \par
used it when she dove with Dale and it had all the latest advances, such as ABC \par
(Automatic Buoyancy Compensation) and a perfect pocket for her underwater \par
camera.  But after all the brouhaha when she came through the marina \par
headquarters with her footlocker of electronic equipment, Carol had decided not \par
to attract further attention by bringing in a state-of-the-art diving vest.\par
\tab "Nick thinks the new vests make it too easy for the diver.  He wants them \par
to have to adjust their buoyancy manually \emdash  so that they are more conscious of \par
how far down they are."  Troy looked Carol over.  "You're pretty light.  This \par
belt may be enough by itself.  Do you normally use any weights?"\par
\tab Carol shook her head and pulled the belt around her waist.  Nick came \par
around the canopy carrying his mask and flippers.  He had already put on his \par
diving vest with air bottle and his weighted belt.  "Those whales of yours are \par
still in the same spot down there," he said.  "I've never seen whales hang \par
around like that.  "He handed her a piece of chewing tobacco.  She rubbed the \par
tobacco on the inside of her mask (to prevent fogging) while Nick walked around \par
behind her.  He looked at her air gauge and checked both her regulator and the \par
secondary mouthpiece that he might have to use to share her air in the event of \par
an emergency.\par
\tab Nick talked to Carol while he was making her final equipment checks.  \par
"This is your charter," he began in what sounded like a friendly tone, "so we \par
can go almost anywhere you want while we are down there.  The dive will not be \par
too difficult, since it's only forty-five feet or so to the floor.  However," \par
Nick moved around in front of Carol and looked directly in her eyes, "I want one \par
thing thoroughly understood.  This is my boat and I am responsible for the \par
safety of the people on it.  Including you, whether you like it or not.  Before \par
we dive, I want to make certain that you will follow my lead under the water."\par
\tab Carol recognized that Nick was trying to be diplomatic.  It even flashed \par
through her mind that he looked sort of cute standing there in front of her in \par
his diving gear.  She decided to be gracious.  "Agreed," she said.  "But one \par
thing before we descend.  Remember that I'm a reporter.  I will have a camera \par
with me and may want you to move from time to time.  So don't get angry if I \par
motion you out of the way."\par
\tab Nick smiled.  "Okay," he said, "I'll try to remember."\par
\tab Carol put on her flippers and mask.  Then she picked up her underwater \par
camera by the strap and threw it over her neck and shoulder.  Troy helped her \par
tighten the strap in the back.  Nick was sitting on the side of the boat at a \par
break in the railing, right next to a crude ladder that Troy had just dropped \par
overboard.  "I've checked the water already," Nick said, "and there's quite a \par
current up here.  Let's go down the anchor rope until we reach the ocean floor.  \par
Then you can pick the direction from there."\par
\tab Nick rolled backward off the boat.  In a moment he surfaced, treading \par
water.  Carol returned his thumbs-up sign (the signal between divers that \par
everything's all right) and sat down herself on the side of the boat.  Troy \par
helped her make one last comfort adjustment to her vest.  "Good luck, angel," \par
Troy said.  "I hope you find what you're looking for.  And be careful."\par
\tab Carol put the regulator in her mouth, took a breath, and then repeated \par
Nick's backward roll maneuver.  The ocean water felt cool against her sunbaked \par
back.  In a few seconds she joined Nick over at the anchor rope and the two of \par
them repeated the thumbs up sign.  Nick led the way down.  He went hand over \par
hand, cautiously, never completely releasing the rope.  Carol followed \par
carefully.  She could feel the strong current that Nick had mentioned.  It \par
pulled at her, trying to take her away from the rope, but she managed to hold \par
on.  Every six to eight feet in the descent, Nick stopped to equalize the \par
pressure in his ears and looked up to see both that Carol was following and that \par
she was all right.  Then he continued his descent.\par
\tab There was nothing much to see until they reached the reef beneath them.  \par
The telescope pictures had been so sharp that they had been misleading.  The \par
reef with its riot of color and its surfeit of plant and animal life had seemed \par
to be right underneath them because of the automatic focusing action of the \par
optical system.  But thirty-five feet is a long way down. Any normal three-story \par
building could have been sitting on the ocean floor underneath the Florida Queen \par
and it would not have touched her hull.\par
\tab When they finally reached the top of the reef where the anchor was \par
implanted, Carol realized she had made a mistake.  She did not recognize her \par
surroundings and therefore did not know which direction to take to find the \par
whales.  She reproached herself briefly for not having spent a few more moments \par
studying the monitor to make sure that she knew where all the landmarks were.  \par
Oh well, Carol then thought, It's too late for that now.  I'll just pick a \par
direction and go.  Besides, I don't have any idea where the alarm object is \par
anyway.\par
\tab Visibility in the water was fair to good, maybe fifty to sixty feet in all \par
directions.  Carol adjusted her buoyancy slightly and then pointed to a gap \par
between two reef structures, both of which were covered with kelp, sea anemones, \par
and the ubiquitous coral.  Nick nodded his head.  Tucking her arms to her side \par
to streamline her movement, Carol kicked up and down with her flippers and swam \par
toward the gap.\par
\tab Behind her, Nick watched Carol swim with appreciation and admiration.  She \par
moved through the water as gracefully as the school of yellow and black \par
angelfish beside her.  Nick had not interrogated Carol very much about her \par
diving experience and had not known exactly what to expect.  He had suspected \par
from her ease and familiarity with the equipment that she was a seasoned diver; \par
but he had not prepared himself for an underwater peer.  Except for Greta, Nick \par
had not encountered a woman before who was as comfortable under the water as he \par
was.\par
\tab Nick absolutely loved the peace and serenity of the rich and vibrant world \par
beneath the ocean surface.  The only sound he ever heard down there was his own \par
breathing.  All around him the coral reefs teemed with life of unimaginable \par
beauty and complexity.  There, underneath him now, was a grouper taking a bath \par
by sitting at the bottom of a natural hole and letting dozens of tiny cleaner \par
fish eat away all the accumulated parasites.  A moment earlier, Nick's downward \par
excursion toward the ocean floor had scared up a manta ray hidden in the sand.  \par
This large ray, called a devilfish by the cognoscenti, had undulated out of its \par
hiding place at the last moment and just missed Nick with its powerful and \par
dangerous tail.\par
\tab Nick Williams felt at home down in this watery world at the bottom of the \par
Gulf of Mexico.  It was his recreation and his refuge.  Whenever he was \par
distressed or disturbed by events on the surface, he knew that he could dive and \par
find relaxation and escape.  Except on this particular dive he was aware of an \par
ineffable emotion, a beginning perhaps, a longing that was barely defined, \par
possibly mixed up with a memory of years ago.  He was following a beautiful \par
mermaid as she swam along the reef and the sight stirred him.  I have acted like \par
a schoolboy, he thought, and a bore.  Or worse.  And why?  Because she is \par
pretty?  No.  Because she is so alive.  So much more alive than I am\par
\par
\tab Carol and Nick made two different excursions, each time starting from the \par
anchor rope, without finding the whales or anything else unusual.  When they \par
returned to the anchor after the second unsuccessful foray, Nick pointed at his \par
watch.  They had been under the water for almost half an hour already.  Carol \par
wagged her head up and down and then held up her index finger, indicating that \par
she would try one more direction.\par
\tab They found the whales right after they crossed over a big upward bulge in \par
the reef that came within fifteen feet of the surface.  Nick saw them first and \par
pointed down.  The three whales were about twenty feet below them and maybe \par
thirty yards ahead.  They were still swimming slowly, more or less together, in \par
the same directionless, near circular pattern that Nick and Carol had watched on \par
the screen.  Carol waved Nick out of the way and pointed at her camera.  She \par
then swam toward the whales, taking pictures as she approached them while \par
carefully monitoring her depth and equalizing the pressure in her ears.\par
\tab Nick swam down beside her.  He was certain the whales had seen the two of \par
them, but for some reason they had made no attempt to flee.  In all his years as \par
a diver, Nick had only once seen a whale in the open ocean accept the nearby \par
presence of a human.  And that had been a calfing mother, in a Pacific Ocean \par
lagoon off of Baja California, whose birth pangs were a more powerful force than \par
her instinctive fear of humans.  Here even when Carol approached to within \par
twenty feet or so the whales continued their indolent drift.  They appeared to \par
be lost, or maybe even drugged.\par
\tab Carol slowed her approach when the whales made no attempt to get away.  \par
She took some more photographs.  Close-up pictures of whales in their natural \par
habitat were still uncommon, so her trip had already been a journalistic \par
success.  But she too was puzzled by their behavior.  Why were they ignoring her \par
presence?  And what were they doing hanging around this particular spot?  She \par
remembered being surprised by the solitary whale during her morning swim and \par
wondered again if somehow all these strange events were related.\par
\tab Nick was off to her right, about twenty yards away.  He was pointing at \par
something on the other side of the whales and gesturing for Carol to come toward \par
him.  She swam away from the great mammals and headed in Nick's direction.  She \par
saw immediately what had attracted his attention.  Below the whales, just above \par
the ocean floor, there was a large dark hole in the bottom of an imposing reef \par
structure.  At first glance it appeared to be the entrance to an underground \par
cave of some kind.  But Carol's sharp eyes noticed that the lip-shaped fissure \par
was extremely smooth and symmetric, almost suggesting to her that it was an \par
engineering construction of some kind.  She laughed at herself as she swam up \par
beside Nick.  The amazing underwater world and the bizarre behavior of these \par
whales were playing tricks with her mind.\par
\tab Nick pointed down at the hole and then at himself, indicating that he was \par
going down to check it out more closely.  When he started to leave, Carol had a \par
sudden impulse to reach for his foot and pull him back.  A moment later, as she \par
watched Nick swim away, a powerful fear of unknown origin swept over her.  She \par
began to tremble as she struggled gamely with this strange emotion.  Goose bumps \par
appeared on her arms and legs and Carol felt an overwhelming desire to get away, \par
to escape before something terrible happened.\par
\tab An instant later she saw one of the whales move toward Nick.  If Carol had \par
been on land she could have yelled, but fifty feet deep in the ocean there was \par
no way to warn someone from afar.  As Nick drew near the opening, unaware of any \par
danger, he was brushed to the side by one of the whales with such force that he \par
bounced against the reef and then caromed off.  He fell down onto a small spot \par
of sand on the ocean floor.  Carol swam toward him quickly while keeping a \par
careful eye on the whales.  Nick had lost his regulator and did not seem to be \par
making any attempt to replace it.  She drew up beside him and flashed the \par
thumbs-up sign.  There was no response.  Nick's eyes were closed.\par
\tab Carol felt a surge of adrenaline as she reached for Nick's regulator and \par
thrust it into his mouth.  She beat against his mask with her fist.  After a few \par
painfully long seconds, Nick opened his eyes.  Carol tried thumbs up again.  \par
Nick shook his head, as if he were clearing out the cobwebs, smiled, and then \par
returned the okay signal.  He started to move but Carol restrained him.  She \par
indicated with gestures for him to sit still while she hurriedly looked him \par
over.  From the force with which Nick had hit the reef, Carol feared the worst.  \par
Even if his diving gear was all right, certainly his skin would have been ripped \par
and torn by the sharp coral and the impact.  But incredibly, there did not \par
appear to be significant damage to either Nick or the equipment.  All she could \par
find were a couple of small scrapes.\par
\tab The three whales remained in the same area where they had been before.  \par
Looking up at them from below, Carol thought that they looked like sentinels \par
guarding a particular piece of ocean territory.  Back and forth they swam, \par
inscribing a total composite arc of maybe two hundred yards.  Whatever it had \par
been that had caused one of the whales to vary its swimming pattern and run into \par
Nick was certainly unclear.  But Carol did not want to risk another encounter.  \par
She motioned for Nick to follow her and they swam about thirty yards away, to a \par
sandy trench between the reefs.\par
\tab Carol planned to return to the surface as soon as it was clear that Nick \par
was not seriously hurt.  But while Carol was thoroughly surveying his body to \par
make certain that she had not overlooked any serious lacerations in her hurried \par
check, Nick discovered two parallel indentations in the sand below him.  He \par
grabbed Carol's arm to show her what he had found.  The indentations were \par
grooved like tank tracks and were about three inches deep.  They appeared to be \par
fresh.  In one direction the tracks ran toward the reef fissure underneath the \par
three whales.  In the other direction the parallel lines extended as far as Nick \par
and Carol could see, running along the sandy trench between the two major reefs \par
in the area.\par
\tab Nick pointed up the trench and then swam away in that direction, following \par
the tracks with fascination.  He did not turn around to see if Carol were \par
following.  Carol quickly backtracked as close to the fissure as she dared (was \par
she imagining again or were the three whales watching her as she crept along the \par
ocean floor?) to take some pictures and to verify that the tracks did indeed \par
emanate from the opening in the reef.  She thought she saw a network of similar \par
indentations converging just in front of the fissure, but she did not tarry \par
long.  She didn't want to be separated from Nick in this spooky place.  When she \par
turned around, he was just barely in sight.  But he had fortunately stopped when \par
he realized that Carol was not behind him.  Nick made an apologetic gesture when \par
she finally caught up with him.\par
\tab At one point the parallel lines disappeared as the sandy trench turned to \par
rock, but Nick and Carol located the continuation of the same tracks some fifty \par
yards farther along.  The trench eventually became so narrow that they were \par
forced to swim six feet or so above it to keep from banging against the rocks \par
and coral on either side.  Soon thereafter the tracks and the trench made a left \par
turn and disappeared under an overhang.  Carol and Nick stopped and floated in \par
the water facing each other.  They carried on a conversation with hand gestures.  \par
At length, they decided that Carol would go down first to see if anything was \par
under the overhang, since she wanted a close-up photograph of the disappearance \par
of the tracks anyway.\par
\tab Carol swam carefully down to the floor of the trench, skillfully avoiding \par
contact with the edges of the reef on both sides.  Where it disappeared under \par
the overhang, the trench was just wide enough for her to put one of her \par
flippered feet down lengthwise.  The overhang was about eighteen inches above \par
the floor, but there was no way she could bend down and look underneath without \par
scraping her face or hands against the reef.  Carol gingerly slid her hand under \par
the overhang in the last direction of the tracks.  Nothing.  She would have to \par
brace herself against the rocks and coral and stick her hand deeper into the \par
area.\par
\tab While Carol was trying to move herself into a better position, she \par
momentarily lost her balance and felt the sting of coral on the back of her left \par
thigh.  Ouch, she thought as she put her right hand back under the overhang, \par
that's one for me.  One physical reminder of an amazing day.  Weird even. \par
Bizarre whales.  Tank tracks on the bottom of the ocean .  .  . what is this?  \par
Carol's hand closed around what felt like a metallic rod about an inch thick.  \par
It was such a surprising touch, she immediately withdrew her hand and a shudder \par
raced down her spine.  Her heart rate accelerated and she tried to breathe \par
slowly to calm herself.  Then she purposefully put her hand back and found the \par
object again.  Or was it another object?  This time she felt something metallic \par
all right, but it seemed to be wider and to have four tines like a fork.  Carol \par
slid her hand along the object and refound the rod portion.\par
\tab From his vantage point above her, Nick could tell that Carol had \par
discovered something.  Now it was his turn to be excited.  He swam down to her \par
as she struggled unsuccessfully to retrieve the object.  They changed positions \par
and Nick reached under the projecting rock.  He first touched something that \par
felt like a smooth sphere about the size of the palm of his hand.  Nick could \par
tell that the bottom of the sphere rested on the sand and that the rod attached \par
to it was elevated by several inches.  Nick steadied himself and jerked on the \par
rod.  It moved a little.  He moved his grip sideways on the rod and heaved \par
again.  Several more pulls and the object was out from under the overhang.\par
\tab For almost a minute Nick and Carol hovered over the gold-metallic object \par
lying beneath them on the sand.  Its surface was smooth to the eye as well as to \par
the touch and altogether it was about eighteen inches long.  Nothing but the \par
polished, reflecting surface could be seen, suggesting that the object was \par
indeed made from some kind of metal.  The long axis of the object was an inch-\par
thick rod that was, at one end, tapered and worked into a kind of a hook.  Four \par
inches back from the hook was the center of a small sphere, symmetrically \par
constructed around the rod, whose radius was a little over two inches.  The \par
larger sphere that Nick had felt when he first put his hand under the overhang \par
had a radius of four inches or so and it was right in the middle of the rod.  \par
This sphere was also perfectly symmetric around the rod axis.  Beyond the two \par
spheres the object was unadorned until the rod broke into four smaller branches, \par
the tines that Carol had felt, at its other end.\par
\tab Carol carefully took photographs of the object as it lay exposed in front \par
of the overhang.  Before she was finished, Nick pointed at his watch.  They had \par
been underwater almost an hour.  Carol checked her air gauge and found that she \par
was almost into the red.  She waved a sign at Nick and he swam down to pick up \par
the object.  It was extremely heavy, weighing an astonishing twenty pounds or so \par
in Nick's estimation.  Then it wasn't caught on anything when I was trying to \par
pull it out, Nick thought, it's just that heavy.\par
\tab The weight of the object only increased Nick's excitement that had begun \par
when he had first seen the gold color.  Although he had never seen anything \par
quite like this hook and fork with spheres, he remembered that the heaviest \par
pieces from the wreck of the Santa Rosa had all been made of gold.  And this \par
piece was far heavier than anything he had ever touched.  Jesus, he thought to \par
himself as he discarded some of the lead weights in his belt to make it easier \par
for him to carry the object up to the boat, if there's even ten pounds of pure \par
gold here, at current market value of a thousand dollars an ounce, that's \par
$160,000, and this may just be the beginning.  Wherever this thing came from, \par
there must be more.  All right, Williams. This may be your lucky day.\par
\tab Carol's thoughts raced at a mile a minute as she swam in tandem with Nick \par
toward the anchor rope.  She was busy trying to integrate everything she had \par
seen in the last hour.  She was already convinced that everything was somehow \par
associated with the errant Navy missile \emdash  the behavior of the whales, the golden \par
fork with the hook, the tank tracks on the bottom of the ocean.  But at first \par
Carol had no clue about what the connections were.\par
\tab During the swim back Carol suddenly remembered reading some years before a \par
story about Russian submarine tracks being found on the ocean floor outside a \par
Swedish naval yard.  In her journalistic mind she began to concoct a wild but \par
plausible scenario to explain everything that she had seen.  Maybe the missile \par
crashed near here and continued to send out data even when it was underwater, \par
she thought to herself.  Its electronic signals somehow confused the whales.  \par
And maybe those same signals were picked up by Russian submarines.  And \par
American.  Her thoughts came to a temporary dead end for a moment.  So there are \par
at least two choices, Carol thought again after swimming a few more strokes and \par
watching Nick approach the anchor rope with the golden object still firmly in \par
his hand.  Either I've found a Russian plot to locate and steal an American \par
missile.  Or the tracks and goldenfork are somehow part of an American effort to \par
find the missile without alerting the public.  It doesn't matter.  Either way \par
it's a big story.  But I must take that golden thing to Dale and MOI to analyze.\par
\tab Both Nick and Carol were dangerously low on air by the time they reached \par
the surface beside the Florida Queen.  They called Troy to give them a hand with \par
their prize from the deep.  Carol and Nick were exhausted when they finally \par
crawled into the boat.  But they were also both on emotional highs, thrilled \par
with the discoveries of the afternoon.  Everyone started talking at once.  Troy \par
had a story to tell too, for he had seen something unusual on the monitor while \par
Nick and Carol were following the tracks in the trench.  Nick pulled some beer \par
and sandwiches out of the refrigerator and Carol tended her coral cuts.  The \par
laughing trio sat down on the deck chairs together as the sun was setting.  They \par
had much to share during the ninety-minute trip back to Key West.\par
\par
\par
8\par
\par
THE camaraderie lasted most of the way back to the marina.  Nick was no longer \par
taciturn.  Excited by what he believed was the initial find of a major sunken \par
treasure, he was positively a chatterbox.  At least twice he retold his version \par
of the whale encounter.  Nick was certain that the collision was accidental, \par
that the whale simply happened to be moving in that direction for some other \par
reason and just paid no attention to the fact that Nick was there.\par
\tab "Impossible," Nick had scoffed when Carol had initially suggested that the \par
whale might have deliberately hit him because he was heading for the fissure in \par
the reef.  "Whoever heard of whales guarding a spot in the ocean.  Besides, if \par
your theory's right, then why didn't the whale really smack me, and finish me \par
off?  You're asking me to accept that the whales were protecting an underground \par
cave?  And then that they were warning me to stay away with that gentle push?"  \par
He laughed good-naturedly.  "Let me ask you something, Miss Dawson," he said, \par
"do you believe in elves and fairies?"\par
\tab "From where I was watching," Carol replied, "it sure looked as if the \par
whole thing was planned.  "She did not pursue the subject further.  In fact, \par
after her initial outbursts, Carol did not talk very much about anything on the \par
trip back to Key West.  She too was excited and she was worried that if she \par
talked too much she might inadvertently give away her thoughts about the \par
possible connection between what they had seen and the lost Navy missile.  So \par
she didn't mention either her eerie fear just before the whale hit Nick or the \par
network of tracks she thought she saw converging just under the base of the \par
fissure.\par
\tab As far as Nick was concerned, the object they had retrieved was definitely \par
part of a treasure.  It didn't bother him that it was hidden under an overhang \par
at the end of some strange tracks.  He shrugged it off by suggesting that maybe \par
somebody had found the sunken treasure several years earlier and then tried to \par
hide a few of the better pieces.  (But why were the tracks fresh?  And what had \par
made them?  Carol wanted to ask these questions but realized it was in her best \par
interest for Nick to remain convinced that he had found treasure.)  Nick was \par
blind to all arguments and even facts that didn't support his treasure theory.  \par
It was emotionally vital to Nick for the gold fork thing to be the first piece \par
of a great discovery.  And like many people, Nick was capable of suspending his \par
normally sharp critical faculties when he had a vested emotional involvement in \par
an issue.\par
\tab When Nick and Carol finally quieted down enough to listen, Troy had a \par
chance to tell his own story.  "After you guys left the area underneath the \par
boat, I guess to follow your trench, I became worried about you and started \par
watching the screen more often.  Now, angel, by this time those three whales had \par
been swimming about in that same dumb pattern for over an hour.  So I wasn't \par
checking them real close."\par
\tab Troy was up out of his deck chair, walking back and forth in front of \par
Carol and Nick.  It was a dark night; low clouds had rolled in from the north to \par
block the moon and obscure most of the stars.  The spotlight from the top of the \par
canopy occasionally caught Troy's chiseled features as he moved in and out of \par
the shadows.  "Because I wanted to find you guys, I lifted the alarm suppression \par
the way you showed me and was regularly serenaded by the ding-dong-ding from the \par
three whales.  Now listen to this.  After a couple of minutes, I heard a fourth \par
alarm.  I looked down at the monitor, expecting to see one of you, and I saw \par
another whale, same species, swimming underneath the other three and in the \par
opposite direction.  Within ten seconds the original whales turned, breaking \par
their long pattern, and followed the new whale off the monitor to the left.  \par
They never returned."\par
\tab Troy wound up the story with a dramatic inflection and Nick laughed out \par
loud, "Jesus, Jefferson, you do have a way of telling a story.  I suppose you're \par
going to tell me now that these whales were stationed there and the new guy came \par
along with different orders.  Or something like that.  Christ, between you and \par
Carol, you'll have me believe that the whales are organized into covens of \par
whatever."  Nick stopped for a moment.  Troy was disappointed that Carol didn't \par
say anything.\par
\tab "Now," Nick continued, dismissing Troy's story and getting to the subject \par
he had been thinking about for almost an hour, "we have an important issue to \par
discuss.  We have brought back something from the ocean that could conceivably \par
be worth a lot of money.  If nobody else can prove conclusively that it is \par
theirs, then it will belong to the finders." Nick looked first at Carol and then \par
at Troy.  "Even though I'm captain and owner of this boat and I carried the \par
thing up from the ocean floor, I'm prepared to offer that we split the proceeds \par
in thirds.  Does that sound fair enough to the two of you?"\par
\tab There was a moderately long silence before Troy answered.  "Sure, Nick, \par
that sounds fine to me."  Nick smiled and reached across to shake Troy's hand.  \par
He then extended his hand to Carol.\par
\tab "Just a minute," she said quietly, looking directly at Nick and not taking \par
his hand.  "Since you've decided to start this conversation, there are several \par
more items that must be discussed.  It's not simply a question of money for this \par
object.  There's also the issue of possession.  Who keeps the golden trident?  \par
Who determines when we've been offered a fair price?  What do we agree to say, \par
or not to say, to others?  And what if other objects are found down there by one \par
or more of us?  Do we all share?  There's an entire agreement that must be \par
worked out before we dock."\par
\tab Nick frowned.  "Now I understand why you've been so quiet these last few \par
minutes.  You've been thinking about your share.  I misjudged you.  I thought \par
you might decide not to create any more trouble \emdash  "\par
\tab "Who said anything about trouble?"  Carol interrupted him abruptly, her \par
voice rising slightly.  "If you must know, I'm not that interested in the damn \par
money.  I will gladly take my one-third if any dollars are forthcoming from the \par
trident there, for I certainly deserve it.  But if any more such treasures are \par
down there and you and Troy can find them without me, then be my guest.  I want \par
something else."\par
\tab Both men were now listening intently.  "First and foremost, I want \par
exclusive rights to this story, and that means absolute secrecy about what we \par
have found, when and where we found it, and anything else associated with it \emdash  \par
at least until we're certain there's nothing more to learn.  Second, I want \par
immediate possession of the object for forty-eight hours, before anyone else \par
knows that it exists.  After that you can have it to take to the authorities for \par
evaluation."\par
\tab Uh oh, Carol thought to herself as she saw the searching looks she had \par
elicited from Nick and Troy.  I overdid it.  They suspect something.  Better \par
back off just a bit.  "Of course," she smiled disarmingly, "I've just given my \par
initial position.  I expect that some negotiations may be necessary."\par
\tab "Wow, angel," Troy said with a laugh, "that was some speech.  For just a \par
minute there, I thought that maybe there was a whole other game going on here \par
and you were the only one playing.  Of course the professor and I will be \par
delighted to discuss an agreement with you, won't we, Nick?"\par
\tab Nick nodded.  But he had also been alerted by the careful organization and \par
unmistakable intensity of Carol's response.  It seemed out of proportion to the \par
journalistic value of their find.  Is she trying to make this some kind of a \par
contest between us? he thought to himself.  Or am I missing something \par
altogether?\par
\par
\tab They had worked out a compromise agreement by the time the Florida Queen \par
reached the dock in Key West.  Nick would take the golden trident (both of the \par
men liked Carol's name for the object) with him on Friday morning.  There was an \par
elderly woman in Key West who was a compendium of treasure knowledge and she \par
would be able to assess its value and to give its probable place and date of \par
origin.  The woman would also be a witness to their find in case the trident \par
were ever misplaced.  On Friday afternoon, the three of them would meet on the \par
boat or in the marina parking lot at four o'clock.  Nick would give the object \par
to Carol and she would keep it over the weekend.  After she returned it to Nick \par
on Monday morning, he would be responsible for its care and eventual sale.  The \par
three of them had joint ownership of the trident, but Carol waived any interest \par
in future discoveries.  Carol wrote the terms of the simple agreement on the \par
back of a restaurant menu from her purse, they all signed it, and she promised \par
to bring copies back the next day.\par
\tab Troy was quiet and subdued while he was loading all Carol's equipment back \par
into the footlocker.  He lifted the locker onto the cart and then pulled the \par
cart along the jetty.  Carol walked beside him.  It was about nine o'clock and \par
very quiet at the marina.  The tall fluorescent lights created a strange \par
reflection on the wooden jetties.  "Well, angel," Troy said as Carol and he \par
approached the marina headquarters, "it's been quite a day.  I've really enjoyed \par
your company."  He stopped and turned to look at her.  Her black hair had dried \par
unevenly and looked a bit disheveled, but her face was beautiful in the \par
reflected light.\par
\tab Troy looked away, out at the water and the boats.  "You know, it's a shame \par
sometimes the way life works.  You meet somebody by chance, you strike up a \par
friendship, and then poof, they're gone.  It's all so .  .  .  so transient."\par
\tab Carol came over beside him and stretched to kiss his cheek.  "And you know \par
I like you, too," she said, lightening up the conversation with a grin and \par
making certain that Troy understood what kind of a friendship they could have.  \par
"But cheer up.  All is not lost.  You'll see me tomorrow for a while and then \par
maybe when I return the golden thing on Monday."\par
\tab She hooked her arm through his as they momentarily walked back down the \par
Jetty, away from the loaded cart.  "And who knows," Carol laughed, "I'm down in \par
the Keys from time to time.  We could have a drink together and you could tell \par
me some more stories.  "They could just barely make out the spotlight above the \par
canopy on the Florida Queen some hundred yards in the distance.  "I see your \par
friend the professor is still at work.  He's not strong on good-byes.  Or any \par
other area of manners as far as I can tell."\par
\tab She turned, switching locked arms, and they walked back to the loaded \par
cart.  They moved through the apparently deserted headquarters without speaking.  \par
When the footlocker had been replaced in the station wagon, Carol gave Troy a \par
hug.  "You're a good man, Troy Jefferson," she said.  "I wish you well."\par
\par
\tab Nick was almost ready to leave by the time Troy returned to the boat.  He \par
was packing a small exercise bag.  "Looks innocent enough, doesn't it, Troy?  \par
Nobody will ever suspect that one of the great treasures of the ocean is in \par
here."  He paused a moment and changed the subject.  "You put her safely in her \par
car?  Good.  She's a strange one, isn't she, all feisty and aggressive but still \par
pretty at the same time.  I wonder what makes her tick."\par
\tab Nick zipped up the bag and walked around to the side of the canopy.  "Just \par
finish up with the diving gear tonight.  Don't worry about the rest of the boat \par
\emdash  we'll fix it up tomorrow.  I'm going to go home and dream of riches."\par
\tab "Speaking of riches, Professor," Troy said with a smile, "how about that \par
hundred-dollar loan I asked you for on Tuesday.  You never answered me and just \par
said we'll see."\par
\tab Nick walked deliberately over to Troy and stood right in front of him.  He \par
spoke very slowly.  "I should have made my Polonius speech to both of us when \par
you asked me for a loan the first time.  But here we are now, borrower and \par
lender, and I don't like it.  I will lend you a hundred dollars but, Mister Troy \par
Jefferson, this is positively the last time.  Please don't ever ask me again.  \par
These loans for your so-called inventions are making it hard for me to work with \par
you."\par
\tab Troy was a little surprised by the unexpected harshness in Nick's tone.  \par
But he was also angered by the connotation of the last sentence.  "Are you \par
suggesting," Troy said softly, suppressing his temper, "that I'm not telling the \par
truth, that the money is not being spent on electronics?  Or are you telling \par
that you don't believe an uneducated black man could possibly invent anything \par
worth having?"\par
\tab Nick faced Troy again.  "Spare me your righteous racial indignation.  This \par
is not a question of prejudice or lies.  It's money, pure and simple.  My \par
lending you money is fucking up our friendship."  Troy started to speak but Nick \par
waved him off.  "Now it's been a long day.  And a fascinating one at that.  I've \par
said all I want to say on the subject of the loan and I consider the issue \par
finished."\par
\tab Nick picked up his bag, said good night, and left the Florida Queen.  Troy \par
went behind the canopy to organize the diving gear.  About ten minutes later, \par
just as he was finishing, he heard someone calling his name.  "Troy .  .  .  \par
Troy, is that you?" an accented voice said.\par
\tab Troy leaned around the canopy and saw Greta standing on the jetty under \par
the fluorescent light.  Even though there was now a slight chill in the air, she \par
was wearing her usual skimpy bikini that showed off her marvelous physique.  \par
Troy broke into a grand smile, "Well, well, if it isn't superkraut!  How the \par
hell are you?  I can see you're still taking care of that wondrous body."\par
\tab Greta managed the beginnings of a smile.  "Homer and Ellen and I are \par
having a small party tonight.  We noticed that you were working late and thought \par
that maybe you'd like to join us when you're done."\par
\tab "Just might do that," Troy said, nodding his head up and down.  "Just \par
might do that."\par
\par
\par

\par
"OH, God, can't we stop now?  Finally?  Please let us.  It's so quiet here, \par
now."  She was speaking to the stars and the sky.  The old man's head slumped \par
forward in the wheelchair as he drew his last breath.  Hannah Jelkes knelt \par
beside him to see if he was indeed gone and then, after kissing him on the crown \par
of the head, she looked up again with a peaceful smile.  The curtain fell and \par
rose again in a few seconds.  The cast assembled quickly on stage.\par
\tab "Okay, that's it for tonight, good job."  The director, a man in his early \par
sixties, gray hair thinning on the top, approached the stage with a bounce.  \par
"Great performance, Henrietta, try to can that one for the opening tomorrow \par
night.  Just the right combination of strength and vulnerability."  Melvin \par
Burton nimbly jumped up on the stage.  "And you, Jessie, if you make Maxine any \par
lustier they'll close us down."  He spun around with a flourish and laughed \par
along with two other people at the front of the theater.\par
\tab "Okay, gang," Melvin turned back to address the cast, "now go home and get \par
lots of rest.  It was better tonight, looked good Oh, Commander, can you and \par
Tiffani stay around for a moment after you change?  I have a couple more \par
pointers for you."\par
\tab He jumped back down from the stage and walked back to the fourth row of \par
the theater where his two associates were sitting.  One was a woman, even older \par
than Melvin but with twinkling green eyes behind her granny glasses.  She was \par
wearing a bright print dress full of spring colors.  The other person was a man, \par
about forty, with a studious face and a warm, open manner.  Melvin fretted as he \par
sat down beside them.  "I worried when we picked Night of the Iquana that it \par
might be too difficult for Key West.  It's not as well known as Streetcar or \par
Glass Menagerie.  And in some ways the characters are just as foreign as those \par
in Suddenly, Last Summer.  But it looks almost okay.  If we can just fix the \par
scenes between Shannon and Charlotte."\par
\tab "Are you sorry now you added the prologue?" the woman asked.  Amanda \par
Winchester was an institution in Key West.  Among other things, she was the \par
doyenne of the theatrical entrepreneurs in the revitalized city.  She owned two \par
of the new theaters near the marina and had been responsible for the formation \par
of at least three different local repertory groups.  She loved plays and theater \par
people.  And Melvin Burton was her favorite director.\par
\tab "No, I'm not, Amanda.  It clearly adds to the play to get some kind of \par
initial feeling for how frustrating it would be to lead a group of Baptist women \par
on a tour of Mexico in the summer.  And without the sex scene between Charlotte \par
and Shannon in that small, stuffy hotel room, I'm not sure their affair is \par
believable to the audience."  He paused a moment, reflecting.  "Huston did the \par
same thing with the movie."\par
\tab "Right now that sex scene doesn't play at all," the other man said.  "In \par
fact it's almost comical.  The hugs they exchange are like the ones my brother \par
gives his daughters."\par
\tab "Patience, Marc," Melvin answered.\par
\tab "Something has to be done or we should take the prologue out altogether," \par
Amanda agreed.  "Marc's right, the scene tonight was almost comical.  Part of \par
the problem is that Charlotte looks like a child in that scene."  She paused a \par
moment before continuing.  "You know, the girl has gorgeous long hair and we \par
have it stacked on top of her head to look prim and proper.  Clearly she \par
wouldn't wear it down all day in the heat of a Mexican summer.  But what if she \par
took it down when she went to Shannon's room?"\par
\tab "That's a great idea, Amanda.  As I have often said, you would have made a \par
fabulous director."  Melvin looked at Marc and they exchanged a warm smile.  \par
Then the director settled back in his seat and started thinking about what he \par
was going to tell his two cast members in a few moments.\par
\tab Melvin Burton was a happy man.  He lived with his room-mate of fifteen \par
years, Marc Adler, in a beach house on Sugarloaf Key, about ten miles east of \par
Key West.  Melvin had directed plays on Broadway for almost a decade and had \par
been associated with the theater in one capacity or another since the mid-\par
fifties.  Always careful with his money, Melvin had managed to save an \par
impressive amount by 1979.  Worried about the impact of inflation on his \par
savings, Melvin had sought advice from an accountant who was a friend of a close \par
associate.  It was almost love at first sight.  Marc was twenty-eight at the \par
time, shy, lonely, unsure of himself in the maelstrom of New York City.  \par
Melvin's savoir faire and theatrical panache opened Marc up to aspects of life \par
that he had never known.\par
\tab As the stock market ratcheted upward in the mid-eighties, Melvin watched \par
his net worth near a million dollars.  But other factors in his life were not so \par
bullish.  The AIDS epidemic hit the theatrical community in New York with a \par
vengeance and both Melvin and Marc lost many of their lifelong friends.  And \par
Melvin's career seemed to have peaked; he was no longer in demand as one of the \par
premier directors.\par
\tab One night on his way home from the theater, Marc was mugged by a group of \par
teenagers.  They beat him up, stole his watch and wallet, and left him bleeding \par
in the street.  As a saddened Melvin ministered to his friend's wounds, he made \par
a major decision.  They would leave New York.  He would sell his stocks and \par
convert his fortune to fixed income investments.  They would buy a home where it \par
was warm and safe, where they could relax and read and swim together.  Maybe \par
they would do some community theater work if it was available, but that was not \par
the most important thing.  What was important was that they share Melvin's \par
remaining years.\par
\tab Melvin ran into Amanda Winchester one day while he and Marc were on \par
vacation in Key West.  They had worked together briefly on a project that had \par
never panned out twenty years before.  Amanda told him that she had just formed \par
a local amateur repettory group to do two Tennessee Williams plays a year.  \par
Would he be interested in directing them?\par
\tab Melvin and Marc moved to Key West and started to build their house on \par
Sugarloaf Key.  Both of them thoroughly enjoyed their work with the Key West \par
Players.  The actors were everyday people, dedicated and earnest.  Some had had \par
a little acting experience.  But for the most part, the secretaries, housewives, \par
and retail clerks, plus officers and enlisted men from the U.S.  Naval Air \par
Station, were all novices with one thing in common.  Each of them viewed his few \par
days on the stage as his moment of glory, and he wanted to make the best of it.\par
\tab Commander Winters came out of the dressing room first.  He was wearing his \par
uniform (he had come right over to rehearsal from the base) and looked a bit \par
stiff and uncertain.  He sat down in one of the theater chairs next to Amanda \par
Winchester.  "I was really glad to see you back again," said Amanda, taking his \par
hand.  "I thought your Goober last fall was just right."\par
\tab Winters thanked her politely.  Amanda changed the subject.  "So how are \par
things out at the base?  I read an article the other day in the Miami Herald \par
about all the modern weapons the Navy has these days, pilotless submarines and \par
vertical takeoff fighters and search and destroy torpedoes.  There seems to be \par
no limit to our ability to build more powerful and dangerous toys for war.  Are \par
you involved with all that?"\par
\tab "Only in a limited way," Commander Winters answered pleasantly.  Then, \par
anticipating the discussion with the director, he leaned forward so that he \par
could see Melvin and Marc as well as Amanda.  "I apologize if I was a little \par
flat tonight," he began.  "We have a couple of big problems out at the base and \par
I may have been a bit distracted, but I'll be ready tomorrow \emdash  "\par
\tab "Oh, no," said Melvin, interrupting him, "that's not what I wanted to talk \par
to you about.  It's your first scene with Tiffani  .  .  .  Ah, here she comes.  \par
Let's go up on the stage."\par
\tab Tiffani Thomas was almost seventeen years old and a junior at Key West \par
High School.  A Navy brat all her life, Tiffani had gone to seven different \par
schools in her eleven years since kindergarten.  Her father was a \par
noncommissioned officer who had been assigned to Key West about three months \par
before.  She had been recommended to Melvin Burton by the high school drama \par
teacher when it became apparent that Denise Wright simply could not play the \par
role of Charlotte Goodall.\par
\tab "She hasn't done anything for me yet except rehearse," the teacher had \par
said of Tiffani, "but she learns her lines quickly and has a quality, an \par
intensity I guess, that sets her apart from the others.  And she's clearly been \par
in plays before.  I don't know if she can get ready in three weeks, but she's my \par
first choice by far."\par
\tab Tiffani probably would not have been called beautiful by her Florida \par
classmates.  Her features were too much out of the ordinary to be be properly \par
appreciated by most high school boys.  Her assets were olive eyes, quiet and \par
brooding, light freckles on a pale complexion, long red eyelashes tinged with \par
brown, and a magnificent head of thick auburn hair.  Her carriage was proper and \par
erect, not slumped like most teenagers, so she probably seemed aloof to her \par
peers.  "Striking," Amanda called her, accurately, when she first saw Tiffani.\par
\tab She was standing on the stage alone in her short-sleeved blouse and jeans \par
as the two men approached.  Her hair was pulled back in a ponytail the way her \par
father liked it.  Tiffani was very nervous.  She was worried about what Mr. \par
Burton was going to say to her.  She had overheard the buyer who was playing \par
Hannah Jelkes say that Melvin might do away with the part of Charlotte \par
altogether if "the new girl can't hack it.  "I have worked so hard for this \par
part, Tiffani thought.  Oh please, please, don't let it be bad news.\par
\tab Tiffani was looking down at her feet when Melvin Burton and Commander \par
Winters joined her on the stage.  "Well, now," Melvin began, "let's get straight \par
to the point.  The first scene with you two in the hotel room is not working.  \par
In fact, it's a disaster.  We must make some changes."\par
\tab Melvin saw that Tiffani was not looking at him.  Gently he put his hand \par
under her chin and lifted it until her eyes met his.  "You must look at me, \par
child, for I'm trying to tell you some very important things." He noticed that \par
her eyes were brimming with water and his years of experience told him \par
immediately what was wrong.  He leaned forward and whispered so that nobody else \par
could hear, "I said we would make some changes, not do away with the scene.  Now \par
get yourself together and listen up."\par
\tab Burton regained his director's voice and turned toward Winters.  "In this \par
scene, Commander, your character Shannon and young Miss Goodall engage in \par
foreplay that leads to intercourse later that night.  In the following scene \par
they are discovered, in flagrante delicto, by the confused Miss Fellowes.  And \par
that establishes the desperate situation causing Shannon to run to Maxine and \par
Fred at the Costa Verde.\par
\tab "But our scene does not work right now because nobody watching it will \par
recognize what you two are doing as foreplay.  Now I can change the movement to \par
make it easier \emdash  putting Shannan already on the bed when he discovers Charlotte \par
behind the door would be one way \emdash  and I can change Charlotte's clothing so that \par
she looks less like a little girl, but there's one thing that I cannot do .  .  \par
." Melvin stopped and looked back and forth from Tiffani to Winters.  They were \par
both staring blankly at him.\par
\tab "Come here, come here, both of you," Melvin said, gesturing impatiently \par
with his right hand.  He dropped his voice again.  He took Tiffani's hand with \par
his left and Commander Winters' with his right.  "You two are lovers for one \par
night in this play.  It is essential that the audience believe this or they will \par
not understand completely why Shannon is at the end of his rope, like the \par
iguana.  Shannon is desperate because he was originally locked out of his church \par
for giving in to the same lust .  .  ."\par
\tab They were both listening but Melvin's director's intuition told him he was \par
still not reaching them.  He had another idea.  He took Tiffani's hand and put \par
it into the commander's, closing his own hand over theirs for emphasis.  "Look \par
at each other for a moment.  That's right."  He turned to Winters.  "She's a \par
beautiful young woman, isn't she, Commander?"\par
\tab Their eyes were in contact.  "And he's a handsome man, isn't he, Tiffani?  \par
I want you to imagine that you have an uncontrollable desire to touch him, to \par
kiss him, to be naked with him."  Tiffani blushed.  Winters fidgeted.  Melvin \par
was fairly certain that he saw a spark, albeit a fleeting one.\par
\tab "Now tomorrow night," he continued, looking at Tiffani and taking his hand \par
off theirs, "I want you to capture that feeling when you're hiding in his room.  \par
I want it to explode out of you when he notices that you are there.  And you, \par
Commander," he looked back at the middle-aged naval officer, "you are torn \par
between an overpowering passion to possess this young girl physically and the \par
almost certain knowledge that it will be the final ruination of both your life \par
and your soul.  You are hopelessly trapped.  Remember, you fear that God has \par
already forsaken you for your past sins.  But, despite that, you finally \par
relinquish yourself to your lust and commit another unpardonable sin."\par
\tab Tiffani and Commander Winters both realized at virtually the same time \par
that their hands were still intertwined.  They looked at each other for a moment \par
and then, embarrassed, awkwardly separated them.  Melvin Burton slipped between \par
his players and put his arms around their shoulders.  "So go on home now and \par
think about what I've said.  And come back tomorrow and really break a leg."\par
\par
\tab Vernon Winters drove the Pontiac into his driveway in suburban Key West \par
just before eleven o'clock.  The house was quiet, the only lights were in the \par
garage and the kitchen.  As regular as the stars, Vernon thought, Hap to bed at \par
ten, Betty to bed at ten-thirty.  In his mind's eye he saw his wife go into his \par
son's bedroom, as she did every night, and fiddle momentarily with his sheets \par
and coverlet.  "Did you say your prayers?"\par
\tab "Yes, ma'am," Hap always answered.\par
\tab Then she would kiss him good night on the forehead, turn out his light as \par
she left the room, and go into her bedroom.  Within ten minutes she would have \par
changed into her pajamas, brushed her teeth, and washed her face.  She would \par
then kneel beside her bed, her elbows on the top of the blanket and her hands \par
clasped right in front of her face.  "Dear God," she would say aloud, and then \par
she would pray until exactly ten-thirty, moving her lips silently with her eyes \par
closed.  Five minutes later she would be asleep.\par
\tab Vernon was aware of a vague disquiet as he walked through the living room \par
toward the three bedrooms on the opposite side of the house from the garage.  \par
There was something stirring in him, something that he could not identify \par
exactly, but he assumed it was associated with either the nervousness of opening \par
night or the sudden return of Randy Hilliard to his life.  He wanted to talk to \par
someone.\par
\tab He stopped at Hap's bedroom first Commander Winters walked in quietly in \par
the dark and sat on the side of his son's bed.  Hap was fast asleep, lying on \par
his side.  A tiny nightlight beside his bed illuminated his profile.  How like \par
your mother you look, Winters thought.  And act.  You two are so close.  I'm \par
almost a trespasser in my own home.  He put his hand gently against Hap's cheek.  \par
The boy did not stir.  How can I make up for all the time I was gone?\par
\tab Winters gently nudged his son awake.  "Hap," he said softly, "it's your \par
dad." Henry Allen Pendleton Winters rubbed his eyes and then sat up quickly in \par
bed.  "Yes, sir," he said, "is anything wrong?  Is Mom all right?"\par
\tab "No," his father answered, and then laughed.  "I mean yes.  Mom's all \par
right.  Nothing's wrong.  I just wanted to talk."\par
\tab Hap looked at the clock beside his bed.  "Ummm, well, okay, Dad.  What do \par
you want to talk about?"\par
\tab Winters was quiet for a moment.  "Hap, did you ever read the copy of the \par
script that I got for you and your mother, the one from my play?"\par
\tab "No, sir.  Not much," Hap replied.  "I'm sorry, but I just couldn't get \par
into it.  I think maybe it's above my head."  He brightened.  "But I'm looking \par
forward to seeing you in it tomorrow night."  There was a long pause.  "Umm, \par
what's it about anyway?"\par
\tab Winters stood up and looked out the open window.  Beyond the screen he \par
could hear the gentle susurration of the crickets.  "It's about a man who loses \par
his place with God because he can't or won't control his actions.  It's about .  \par
.  ." Winters turned his head around quick1y and caught his son eyeing the \par
clock.  A sharp emotional pain raced through him.  He waited until it had abated \par
and then drew a breath.  "Well, we can talk about it some other time, son.  I \par
just realized how late it is."\par
\tab He walked to the door.  "Good night, Hap," he said.\par
\tab "Good night, sir."\par
\tab Vernon Winters walked past his wife's room to the third bedroom at the end \par
of the hall.  He undressed slowly, now even more aware than before of an \par
unfulfilled longing.  He thought for a fleeting second about waking Betty up to \par
talk and maybe .  .  .  But he knew better.  That's not her style, he said to \par
himself, never was.  Even before when we slept together.  And after Libya and \par
the dreams and tears at night who could blame her for wanting her own bedroom.\par
\tab He slipped into his bed in his undershorts.  The soothing melody of the \par
crickets enveloped him.  And besides.  She has her God and I have my despair.  \par
There is nothing left between us except Hap.  We couple as strangers.  both \par
fearing any discovery.\par

Dawson was weary herself.  She was talking to Dale Michaels on the videophone.  \par
Photographs were strewn all over the desk underneath the screen and the video \par
camera.\par
\tab "All right," Carol was saying, "I guess I agree with you.  The only \par

on the couch in the living room of his spacious condominium in Key Biscayne.  In \par
front of him, on the coffee table, was a magnificent jade chess board with green \par
and white squares.  Six carved chess pieces were still on the board, the two \par
opposing queens and four pawns, two from each side.  Dale Michaels paused and \par
looked meaningfully at the camera.  "I know how important this is to you.  I've \par
cancelled my eleven o'clock meeting so I can help you."\par
\tab "Thanks," Carol said automatically.  She felt a trickle of irritation.  \par
Why is it, she thought while Dale talked about one of his new projects at MOI, \par
that men always demand gratitude for every little sacrifice?  If a woman changes \par
her schedule to accommodate a man, it's expected.  But if a man revises his \par
precious schedule it's a big fucking deal.\par

Whew, Carol smiled to herself when she realized that Dale's self-centered focus \par
was bothering her, I must really be beat.  I believe I'm on the verge of being \par

\tab "Aren't you going to make a move?"  Dale replied, pointing at the chess \par
board.\par
\tab "No, I'm not," Carol said, showing just a trace of anger.  "And I may not \par
ever.  Any reasonable player would have accepted the draw that I offered you \par

deal with the idea that one game out of five I can battle you to a tie."\par

one of them she could clearly see four separate tracks converging to a spot just \par
under the fissure.  In another photo the bodies of the three whales were caught \par
in a pose that looked as if they were in the middle of a deep conversation.\par
\tab Carol walked through the spacious lobby in the Marriott Hotel.  The piano \par
bar was almost deserted.  The lithe black pianist was playing an old Karen \par
Carpenter song, "Good-bye to Love.  " A handsome man in his late thirties or \par
early forties was kissing a Rashy young blonde in a nook off to the right.  \par
Carol bridled.  The bimbo must be all of twenty-three, she said to herself, \par
probably his secretary or something equally important.\par
\tab As she wound her way down the long corridor toward her room, Carol thought \par
about her conversation with Dale.  He had told her that the Navy had small robot \par
vehicles, some of them derived from original MOI designs, that could easily have \par
made the tracks.  So it was virtually certain that the Russians had similar \par
vehicles.  He had dismissed the whales' behavior as irrelevant but had thought \par
that her failure to find out if anything else was under the overhang had been a \par
serious mistake.  Of course, Carol had realized when he had said it, I should \par
have spent another minute looking.  Nuts.  I hope I didn't blow it.  In her \par
mind's eye she then had carefully revisited the entire scenario at the overhang \par
to see if there were any clues that something else may have been hidden there.\par
\tab The biggest surprise in the discussion with Dale had come when Carol, in \par
passing, had praised the way the new alarm algorithm had worked.  Dale suddenly \par
had become very interested.  "So the alert code definitely read 101?" he had \par
said.\par
\tab "Yes," she had answered, "that's why I wasn't that astonished when we \par
found the object."\par
\tab "No way," he had said emphatically.  "The trident could not have caused \par
the alert code.  Even if it was at the edge of the field of view of the \par
telescope, and that seems unlikely given how far you followed the trench, it's \par
too small to trigger the foreign object alarm.  And how could it have been seen \par
under the overhang anyway?"  Dale had paused for a few seconds.  "You didn't \par
look at any of the infrared images in realtime, did you?  Well, we can process \par
them tomorrow and see if we can figure out what triggered the alarm."\par
\tab Carol felt strangely defeated as she opened the door to her motel room.  \par
It's just fatigue, she said to herself, not wanting to admit that her \par
conversation with Dale had made her feel inadequate.  She put her briefcase on a \par
chair and walked wearily to the bathroom to wash her face.  Two minutes later \par
she was asleep on the bed in her underclothes.  Her slacks, blouse, shoes, and \par
socks were all stacked together in the corner.\par
\par
\tab She is a little girl again in her dream, wearing the blue-and-yellow \par
striped dress that her parents gave her for her seventh birthday.  Carol is \par
walking around with her father in the Northridge Mall on a busy Saturday \par
morning.  They pass a large candy store.  She lets go of his hand and runs into \par
the store and stares through the glass case at all the chocolates.  Carol points \par
at some milk chocolate turtles when the big man behind the display case asks her \par
what she wants.\par
\tab In the dream Carol cannot reach the counter and doesn't have any money \par
"Where is your mother, little girl?" the candy store man asks.  Carol shakes her \par
head and the man repeats the question.  She stands on her tiptoes and tells the \par
man in a confidential whisper that her mother drinks too much, but that her \par
father always buys her candy.\par
\tab The man smiles, but he still won't give her the chocolates.  "And where is \par
your father, little girl?" the candy store man now asks.  In the case Carol can \par
see the reflection of a kindly, smiling man standing behind her, framed between \par
two piles of chocolates.  She wheels around, expecting to see her father.  But \par
the man behind her is not her father.  This man's face is grotesque, disfigured.  \par
Frightened, she turns back around to the chocolates.  The man in the store is \par
now taking the candy away.  It is closing time.  Carol starts to cry.\par
\tab "Where is your father, little girl?  Where is your father?"  The little \par
girl in the dream is sobbing.  She is surrounded by big people, all of them \par
asking questions.  She puts her hands over her ears.\par
\tab "He's gone," Carol finally shouts.  "He's gone.  He left us and went away \par
and now I'm all alone."\par

CYCLE 447\par
\par
1\par
\par
AGAINST the deep black background of scattered stars the filaments of the Milky \par
Way Galaxy seem like thin wisps of light added by a master artist.  Here, at the \par
far edge of the Outer Shell, near the beginning of what the Colonists call the \par
Gap, there is no suggestion of the teeming activity of the Colony, some twenty-\par
four light millicycles away.  An awesome, unbroken quiet is the background for \par
the breathtaking beauty of a black sky studded with twinkling stars.\par
\tab Suddenly out of the void comes a small interstellar messenger robot.  It \par
seeks and finally finds a dark spherical satellite about three miles in diameter \par
that is easily overlooked in the great panorama of the celestial sky.  Time \par
passes.  A close-up reveals activity on the satellite.  Soft artificial lights \par
now illuminate portions of the surface.  Automated vehicles are working on the \par
periphery of the object, apparently changing its shape.  External structures are \par
dismantled and taken off to a temporary storage area in the distance.  At length \par
the original satellite disappears altogether and what is left are two long \par
parallel rails of metal alloy, built in sections of about two hundred yards \par
apiece from the spare parts of the now vanished satellite.  Each rail is ten \par
yards across and separated from its matched partner by about a hundred yards.\par
\tab Regular sorties to the storage area continue until the useful supplies of \par
material are depleted and the tracks extend for a distance of almost ten miles.  \par
Then activity stops.  The rails from nowhere to nowhere in space stand as mute \par
reminders of some major engineering activity suddenly abandoned.  Or was it?  \par
From just below a prominent binary pair, the two brightest lights in the eastern \par
sky, a speck emerges.  The speck grows until it dominates the eastern quadrant \par
of the sky.  A dozen, no, sixteen great interstellar cargo ships with bright, \par
flashing red lights lead a procession of robot vehicles into the region.  The \par
ghostly rails to nowhere are surrounded by the new arrivals.  The first cargo \par
ship opens and eight small shuttles emerge, each one moving back down the line \par
toward another of the great cargo containers.  The shuttles wait silently \par
outside the huge ships while the entourage completes its arrival.\par
\tab The final vehicle to arrive is a tiny space tug pulling a long, slender \par
object that looks like two folded Japanese fans joined together end to end.  It \par
is encased in a transparent and protective sheath of very thin material.  Eight \par
small, darting vehicles dance like hummingbirds along its entire length, as if \par
they were somehow guiding it, guarding it, and checking out its health all at \par
the same time.\par
\tab The large cargo ships shaped like ancient blimps now open and reveal their \par
contents.  Most of them are carrying rail sections stacked in enormous piles.  \par
The small shuttles unload the sections, leaving them stacked, and set them in \par
groups stretching for miles in both directions from the existing rails.  When \par
the rail sections are almost all unloaded, four of the shuttles approach the \par
side of one of the remaining giant cargo ships and wait for the bay doors to \par
swing open.  From the inside of this cargo ship come eight machines that attack \par
each of the four shuttles in pairs, breaking them carefully into pieces and \par
taking the parts back into the dark of the cargo bay.  A few moments later, an \par
elongated complex of articulating machinery emerges from this great ship.  Once \par
released from the confines of the cargo carrier, it stretches itself into a long \par
bench reaching almost a mile in length.  Every hundred yards or so along the \par
central platform of this bench, a smaller set of coordinated components form \par
into highly organized local groups.\par
\tab This is the automated, multipurpose construction system, one of the \par
technological treasures of the Colonists.  The entire system moves into place at \par
the end of the tracks and its many remote manipulators begin to pull rail \par
sections from the various stacks.  Its sophisticated local hands and fingers \par
deftly put the new sections in place and attach them with atomic welds.  The \par
speed is astonishing.  An entire mile of new track is finished within minutes \par
and the great builder moves to another group of rail section piles.  The \par
completed tracks extend for almost a hundred miles in space.\par
\tab Having finished with one task, the construction system undergoes its next \par
metamorphosis.  Tearing itself into pieces starting from the two ends of the \par
long bench, the monolithic structure disappears and is reorganized into \par
thousands of separate but similar components.  These little antlike contraptions \par
attach themselves in groups to individual rail sections.  They measure carefully \par
all the dimensions and check all the welds between adjacent sections.  Then, as \par
if on cue, the rails on the four ends of the track segments begin to bend and \par
elevate, lifted by the antlike components.  The rails twist upward, upward, \par
bringing the rest of the track with them.  The two long parallel lines are \par
eventually transformed into a giant double hoop, over ten miles in radius, that \par
looks like an amusement park ferris wheel suspended in space.\par
\tab With the completion of the double hoop, the construction system again \par
reconfigures itself.  Some of the new elements of the system pick up the long \par
slender object shaped like end-to-end Japanese fans.  They erect it near the \par
hoop (it is, not surprisingly, almost the exact length as the diameter of the \par
hoops) under the careful surveillance of its hummingbird protectors.  Then the \par
object is hoist into place as a north-south spoke in the double hoop structure.  \par
Some of the hummingbirds produce unseen thin cables and anchor the spoke to the \par
hoop structure at both ends.  The rest of the tiny mechanical speedsters create \par
a web that winds around the center section and connects the great antenna with \par
the east-west axis of the hoops.\par
\tab The antenna, now connected to its supporting structure, opens slowly at \par
both the north and south pole positions on the hoop.  Closer inspection reveals \par
that the hummingbirds are actually pulling the delicate individual folds apart.  \par
The folds spread out until the entire interior of the hoops is covered with a \par
mixture of mesh, ribbing, and amazingly complex local arrays.  The initial \par
deployment is complete.\par
\tab The communication complex next goes through an elaborate self-test while \par
its construction minions stand by in case any problems are encountered.  The \par
tests are successful and the station is declared operational.  Within hours the \par
phalanx of robot emissaries from the inhabited universe picks up all the stray \par
metal lying around and packs it into one of the large cargo ships.  Then, as \par
swiftly as they came, the robot vehicles disappear into the blackness around the \par
station, leaving the imposing hoop structure alone as a reminder of the presence \par
of intelligence in the universe.\par
\tab Around the vast Outer Shell, whose two hundred and fifty-six sections each \par
contain more volume than the Colony, over one thousand similar upgrades have \par
been made during Cycle 446 in an attempt to extend advanced communications \par
capabilities to new locales.  This is the last upgrade of a very difficult group \par
in a region near the Gap.  This group was delayed several times because of an \par
unacceptably high number of manufacturing deficiencies at the nearest major \par
factory over two light millicycles away.  After several attempts to diagnose and \par
repair the problems, eventually the plant had to be closed and virtually rebuilt \par
from scratch.  The total delay to the completion of the project was fourteen \par
millicycles, just about what the Council of Engineers had predicted in their \par
worst-case analysis that accompanied the Cycle 446 Proclamation.\par
\par
*     *     *    *    *\par
\par
\tab As the big moment approaches, all normal activity in the heart of the \par
Colony ceases.  In the last nanocycle, there is no business activity, no \par
entertainment.  The spaceports are even empty.  At precisely 446.9, after two \par
hundred millicycles of debate and discussion by the Council of Leaders, the \par
governmental blueprint for the next era will be delivered and all intelligence \par
in the Colony will be listening.\par
\tab The giant transmitter is activated on schedule and the Cycle 447 \par
Proclamation pours out at an information rate of a hundred trillion bits of \par
information per picocycle.  The actual data rate from the powerful source is \par
much higher, but the information rate is reduced to accommodate requirements for \par
both sophisticated encoding and error checks internal to the data.  With the \par
coding, only Colony receivers equipped with special decryption algorithms can \par
unscramble the message at any level.  And the internal consistency checks on \par
each packet of data in the transmission reduce the probability of receiving an \par
erroneous piece of information, even at an enormous distance, to practically \par
zero.\par
\tab Following the organization and agenda for The Proclamation established in \par
the Era of Genius, between Cycles 371 and 406, the first microcycle of the \par
transmission is a complete summary of the entire plan.  Two hundred nanocycles \par
of this summary are devoted to each of the five divisions governed by the \par
Council of Leaders:  administration, information, communication, transportation, \par
and exploration.  After a planned break of four hundred nanocycles, to allow \par
receiver adjustments along the path of the signal, the transmission of the \par
actual Cycle 447 Proclamation begins.  On and on it goes.  It does not stop \par
until twenty microcycles later.  Four complete microcycles are used for in-depth \par
explanations of the major projects to be undertaken in each of the five \par
disciplines.  Of particular interest to the Committee for the Outer Shell, the \par
group that governs the huge concentric region defining the most distant reach \par
where the Colonists claim jurisdiction, is a plan from the Division of \par
Exploration announcing the repatriation to the Outer Shell of almost a million \par
species from Zoo System #3.\par
\tab (The transmission of The Proclamation, a wealth of information that can be \par
translated into language, pictures, sounds, and other sensory impressions \par
depending on the receiving beings and the sophistication of their decryption \par
equipment, is the beginning of the governmental process for each cycle.  Based \par
upon The Proclamation, regional bodies or administrative agencies with \par
subordinate jurisdictions then adjust their plans for the cycle to be consistent \par
with those announced by the Council of Leaders.  This procedure is defined in \par
detail in the Articles of Colonial Confederation.)\par
\tab The Proclamation is relayed throughout the Colony and the near reaches of \par
the Inner Shell by means of giant communication stations along the developed \par
transportation routes.  These stations, actually information centers that store \par
all Colony messages in their extensive libraries for as long as a hundred \par
cycles, amplify and retransmit the signal to the next station in the pattern \par
some ten light microcycles away.  The edge of the Colony (and hence the \par
beginning of the Inner Shell) was expanded by the Boundary Decree in the Cycle \par
416 Proclamation to include all points up to three light millicycles from the \par
administrative center.  Thus, by the time the Proclamation reaches the mammoth \par
Zoo Complex, a combination of three stars and nineteen planets (four of them \par
artificial) just across the edge of the Colony, the message has been relayed \par
through three hundred stations.\par
\tab The Committee of Zookeepers eagerly awaits the proclamation to find out \par
the response to their recommended expansion of the Zoo Complex.  They are \par
surprised to find their proposal replaced by another repatriation plan.  Once \par
before, in Cycle 429, they had proposed an expansion of the zoo to handle the \par
explosion of successful progeny created by the breakthroughs in adaptive genetic \par
engineering during Cycles 426-428.  At that time also their request had been \par
denied and the Council of Leaders had recommended repatriation to solve the \par
population problem.  During Cycles 430-436 the population of the Zoo Complex was \par
kept approximately constant by these regular transfers of common species back to \par
their original homes\par
\tab But starting with Cycle 437, there was a rapid increase in interest in \par
comparative biology.  It was triggered by the discovery of a fifth class of life \par
form, called Type E by the Council of Biologists, in Section 28 of the Outer \par
Shell.  Subsequent expeditions to the same area showed not only that the \par
dominant life type throughout Sections 28-33 was Type E.  but also that Type A \par
was surprisingly present as well in those sections.  This was the first time \par
that natural evolution in any region had shown a predilection for any kind of \par
life form other than the Type A of the Colonists and its developed hybrids.  The \par
quest to understand these unusual creatures led to the endangered species \par
expeditions in the Outer Shell in Cycles 440 and 441 and the creation, in Cycle \par
442, of several worlds specifically to study the new Type E life forms.\par
\tab Many of these new species flourished in Zoo System #3, causing population \par
and space problems again for the Committee of Zookeepers.  The space shortage \par
was especially severe and it was exacerbated both by the need to segregate all \par
the Type E life forms and by their rapid reproduction.  Therefore, at the \par
beginning of the planning process for this Cycle 447, the Committee of \par
Zookeepers had proposed their small expansion of the Zoo Complex, suggesting not \par
only a fourth zoo system completely dedicated to Type E life forms, but also a \par
vigorous campaign for completing the repatriation of all Colony and Inner Shell \par
species with aggression coefficients below 14.\par
\tab The Committee of Zookeepers are stunned by the scale of the Outer Shell \par
repatriation plan contained in the Cycle 447 Proclamation.  In a lively \par
technical discussion catalyzed by the unexpected proposal, the dangers of \par
returning the Outer Shell life forms to their original planets are vigorously \par
reasserted.  The Committee decides tentatively to take an unusual step-to submit \par
a Proclamation Variance to the Council of Leaders.  In the draft variance the \par
Zookeepers point out that many genetic experiments have been conducted with the \par
new Type E forms, that the evolutionary possibilities for the new species are \par
therefore uncertain, that the monitoring frequencies and test facilities in the \par
Outer Shell are inadequate, and that the aggression coefficients for many of the \par
group are not yet accurately tabulated\par
\tab Before they actually submit the variance, however, the Committee of \par
Zookeepers realizes that someone must have pointed out all these factors in the \par
original debates.  So why was the repatriation policy promulgated?  Was this \par
part of some new overarching design that downgrades the importance of zoological \par
information altogether?  Or is the policy strictly political and possibly \par
connected with the Message from Power #2?\par
\par
\par

\par
IN keeping with the laws of the Colony governing the dissemination and \par
preservation of important historical information, the official commentary of key \par
Council-level organizations accompanies the transmission of the Cycle 447 \par
Proclamation.  Of particular interest to those involved in the Outer Shell \par
repatriation project are the following excerpts from the report of the Council \par
of Engineers:\par
\par
\tab .  .  .  The earliest repatriation to the Inner Shell was done on almost \par
an ad hoc basis, simply transporting the life forms, en masse, to their original \par
region or another of similar environment in a nearby sector.  This was \par
accomplished by conducting a roundup of the tranquilized creatures at their zoo \par
habitats, loading them into huge cargo vessels maintaining internal conditions \par
equivalent to the habitat, and then dispersing them at their new home.  This \par
process worked adequately for small transfers over short distances.  It was also \par
cheap.  However, it had many severe deficiencies that rendered it almost useless \par
for sustained operations.\par
\tab First and foremost, the ontogenetic development of the creatures was \par
completely interrupted by the repatriation procedure.  They were frightened by \par
their removal, disturbed by their necessarily reduced locus of movement during \par
transit, and, once situated in their new locales, bothered by even minute \par
differences from their earlier homes.  Their memories, even if electronically \par
cleansed, retained an intense sense of 1098 that undermined their adjustment.  \par
All these conditions taken together led to a marked phylogenetic increase in \par
aggression coefficient, across the board, that did not significantly damp in \par
some of the species for ten to fifteen generations.  .  .  .\par
\tab .  .  .  From the point of view of spacecraft design, both the size and \par
distance of the proposed transfers precluded using mature specimens long before \par
the biological and developmental problems were thoroughly understood.  When the \par
Cycle 432 Proclamation called for increased repatriation within the Colony and \par
the Inner Shell, there was some panic at the Council of Engineers because it was \par
thought that transportation vehicles on a near planetary scale might be \par
required.  Fortunately, the Committees on Biological Engineering and Advanced \par
Robotics proposed that future transfers be accomplished using suspended zygotes \par
together with new versions of the superintelligent robots serving as zoo \par
monitors.\par
\tab After a few early problems with the zygote technique, It was more or less \par
perfected, at least for the Types A and B life forms 90 prevalent in the Colony.  \par
Repatriation success ratios for the last ten cycles are very high, even for the \par
more difficult types C and D.  However, such success ratios should not be \par
expected in the implementation of the Cycle 447 Proclamation.  Not only are some \par
of the target life forms the newest and least understood in the Zoo Complex, but \par
also they will be repatriated, in many cases, to a distant, poorly documented \par
biological environment where monitoring is as infrequent as every three or four \par
hundred millicycles.  Some of the more advanced Type E forms have amazingly \par
short life spans for lntelligence, as little as five or six millicycles, which \par
means that fifty to a hundred generations may elapse between progress checks.  .  \par
.  .\par
\tab .  .  .  But all in all it is a magnificent challenge for engineering.  \par
Many transfer vehicles will fly well outside the standard transportation \par
infrastructure and therefore must be able to forage raw materials on their own.  \par
Conditions at the target worlds may have changed, so adaptability and the \par
processing of new information will play a critical role in the design.  The \par
electronic components will have more failures due to the long flight times, \par
meaning that extraordinary fault correction systems must be developed and \par
tested.  .  .  .\par
\par
And from the Council of Historians:\par
\par
\tab It is useful to begin our mostly negative comment on the Outer Shell \par
repatriation plan by reminding all Colonists that our Council includes the \par
longest continuously active intelligence pool of any Council In the Directory.  \par
Two of our groups have direct memories of the Era of Genius through many \par
generations of biological refresh.  Thus it is natural that our approach to any \par
proposed project is to assess its merit in terms of its role in the overall \par
evolution and/or strategy of our society.  It is not our desire to dampen the \par
youthful zeal that thrills at the acquisition of new knowledge or the prospect \par
of great adventure; rather, we would like to place a sense of perspective on all \par
Colony endeavors and measure the future impact of any perceived changes in basic \par
policy.  .  .  .\par
\tab .  .  .  The proposed repatriation scheme is still another step in the \par
dangerous folly of unbridled frontierism that began, in our opinion, with the \par
Boundary Decree of Cycle 416.  Instead of discussing the details of the proposed \par
plan without reference to its historical context (there are excellent \par
descriptions of the elements of the plan in the report by the Council of \par
Engineers \emdash  some of the significant short-term risks are listed in the report by \par
the Council of Biologists), we wish to delineate its dangers by including it in \par
our broad indictment of the entire genus of adventures spawned by the Boundary \par
Decree.  .  .  .\par
\tab .  .  .  The justifications advanced for frontierism always sound good on \par
the surface.  Its proponents point out that societal change is produced by new \par
information outside the ordinary sweep of events, that frontierism is \par
essentially aimed at producing this kind of new knowledge, and that the \par
resulting change in perspective that comes from a 'new view of the universe' \par
forces the proper and regular reassessment of our culture.\par
\tab History is usually in general agreement with the advocates of frontierism \par
and that is doubtless why this repatriation proposal and similar other previous \par
exploration activities have been so enthusiastically supported.  However, there \par
are limitations to the benefits redounding from new information, especially when \par
frontier investigations reveal knowledge that is either inimical to the \par
fundamental structure of the society or beyond the comprehension of the most \par
learned groups.  In these cases the diffusion through the society of the new \par
information is unsettling, instead of being enriching and uplifting, and \par
actually undermines the security of the established institutions.\par
\tab A perfect example of what happens when frontierism is embraced without \par
constraint can be seen in the events of the last thirty cycles that led to the \par
receipt of the message from Power #2 in the middle of Cycle 444.  The Boundary \par
Decree initiated the process by establishing, in effect, a new Jurisdictional \par
domain for the Colonists.  The old central Colony had no rigorous boundary.  \par
Significant development extended out to only two light millicycles distance from \par
the administrative center.  The outermost permanently maintained station was at \par
that time a mere ten light millicycles away.  The Decree of Cycle 416 \par
regularized the nearby universe, creating four concentric worlds and expanding \par
the central Colony itself to a radius of three light millicycles.  Three \par
specific Shells were also created, with the Outer Shell defined to be the entire \par
region between twelve and twenty-four light millicycles away from the \par
administrative center.\par
\tab This Outer Shell contained fifty thousand unexplored star systems in a \par
volume a thousand times greater than that of the old central Colony.  During the \par
period between Cycles 425 and 430, almost half of the major initiatives \par
identified in the cyclical proclamations were involved, in one way or another, \par
with the exploration of the Outer Shell.  (It should be pointed out that during \par
those five cycles there was also documented speculation that such a rapid \par
expansion in our knowledge base might have unforeseen ramifications, but the \par
negativists, as they were called, were drowned out by the collective fascination \par
with the exploratory binge.) men, in Cycle 433, our new class of interstellar \par
drones, specifically designed to study and categorize the many worlds of the \par
Outer Shell, encountered a large, quiescent spacecraft of unknown origin.  \par
Careful in situ investigations were unsuccsssful in their attempts to correlate \par
the engineering components of the spaceship with any known technological base \par
for a spacefaring species.\par
\tab Eschewing the caution suggested by many of the Committees, the Council of \par
Leaders had the enigmatic spaceship towed back to one of the developed cities of \par
the Inner Shell.  There it was placed on display and analyzed in detail.  The \par
initial conclusion of the drones was validated.  The spacecraft had not come \par
from anywhere inside the domain of the Colony.  The Council of Engineers \par
concluded that the technological capabillty of this builders was roughly \par
equivalent to that of the Colonists in the early Era of Genius.  But when had it \par
been made?  And where did it come from?  And most importantly, who had made it?\par
\tab By deciding to bring the dead spaceship back to civilization, the Council \par
of Leaders basically guaranteed that the unsettling question of its origin would \par
remain uppermost in the minds of the Colonists.  This unbridled quest for any \par
and all information again worked to destabilize the culture.  The entire society \par
was rife with rumored explanations to the unanswered and disquieting questions \par
raised by the spaceship.  The dominant opinion was that the craft had been a \par
Colonial prototype, never put into production, that had somehow been omitted \par
from the official Encyclopedia of Space Vehicles.  This opinion was consistent \par
with the general tendency of the Colonists to believe they were innately \par
superior to all other life forms.\par
\tab It might have been possible to let the doubts and fears about the unknown \par
spacecraft diminish to nothing, but the Council of Leaders resuscitated the \par
collective anxieties by announcing, in the Cycle 434 Proclamation, that the \par
largest new project of the Colony would be the design and eventual deployment of \par
a new generation of receiver arrays in the Outer Shell.  The purpose of these \par
arrays would be to intercept and decode any coherent radio messages that might \par
be emanating from inside the Gap.  It was a clear indication that the leadership \par
believed the silent spaceship to be of extracolonial origin.\par
\tab In Cycles 435 and 436 wave after wave of disturbing information staggered \par
the Colony.  First there was the premature announcement that many extracolonial \par
messages had been decoded.  This disclosure supported the widespread rumor of \par
multiple Powers in the galaxy, some of them far more evolved than the Colony.  \par
This frightening concept lingered for half a cycle before the Council of \par
Astronomers, responding to these proliferating half-truths, finally announced \par
that all but a handful of the messages could be ascribed to a single power, \par
Power #2, whose center of activity appeared to be about two hundred light \par
millicycles away.  Shortly thereafter their next astonishing announcement \par
unambiguously identified Power #2 transmissions coming from sources as far as \par
one hundred and fifty light millicycles apart, or more than three times the \par
diameter across the entire Colony Jurisdiction!\par
\tab Between Cycle 438 and the receipt of the message, the Council of Leaders \par
ignored advice that the Colony should carefully husband its resources while \par
analyzing the impact of the discovery of the strange spaceship.  Crash programs \par
were instituted in advanced encryption, it is true, primarily to allay concerns \par
that Power #2 might be monitoring all our transmissions.  This action was widely \par
hailed as a step in the right direction.  However, at the same time the \par
exploration of the Outer Shell was intensified, leading to the identification of \par
the new Type E life forms and the subsequent, thinly disguised endangered \par
species roundup.  All suggestions to retrench and slow down the exploration \par
program were ignored.  In Cycle 442, in fact, the Zoo Complex created several \par
artificial planets just for the conduct of genetic capabilities experiments with \par
the Type E species.\par
\tab Then came the Message from Power #2.  So simple, so straightforward, so \par
terrifying.  It was coded in our most advanced encryption algorithm.  It \par
acknowledged our mutual awareness of one another and suggested opening up \par
bilateral communications.  Nothing else.  End of Message.  .  .  .\par
\tab .  .  .  It is not fear of hostility from Power #2 that motivates our \par
objection to continued exploration in the Outer Shell.  On the contrary.  We as \par
historians think the nascent concern about the possible aggressiveness of Power \par
#2 is unfounded.  Study after study has shown that there is a significant \par
positive correlation between high aggression coefficient and inability to evolve \par
into a society with a purview greater than a single solar system.  In fact, the \par
probability that a society as advanced as ours could have retained aggression \par
and territoriality as constituents in its overall psychological makeup is \par
vanishingly small.\par
\tab Nevertheless, such monumental events as the receipt of the message from \par
Power #2 call for reflection and synthesis, not additional exploratory \par
activities.  We should be using our resources to study and understand the entire \par
range of impacts that the message will have on our society, not squandering them \par
on bold repatriation schemes.  It is a question of priorities and once again the \par
advocates of frontierism, exalting new information and technological development \par
over the stability of the society, are blind to the downside risks of their \par
endeavors.  .  .  .\par

FRIDAY\par
1\par
\par
NICK Williams woke up at five o'clock in the morning and could not go back to \par
sleep.  His mind was too active, racing over and over the events of the day \par
before and the possible outcomes of the day ahead.  The same phenomenon had \par
occurred often when he was in high school in Virginia and then a few times \par
later, at Harvard, usually just before big swimming meets.  If he had too much \par
excitement running through his system, his brain would not turn off enough to \par
let him sleep.\par
\tab He lay in bed for almost another hour, alternately trying to coax himself \par
back to sleep and indulging his fantasy that what he had found the day before \par
was just the first item in a vast cache of valuable treasure.  Nick loved to \par
fantasize.  It was always easy for him to see, in his mind's eye, all the scenes \par
in the novels that he loved so much to read.  Now for a moment he imagined \par
headlines in the Miami Herald announcing his discovery of a hoard of sunken gold \par
off the coast of Key West.\par
\tab Around six o'clock Nick gave up trying to sleep and climbed out of bed.  \par
The little exercise bag was next to the dresser.  He pulled the golden trident \par
out to look at it, as he had done four or five times the night before.  What was \par
this thing? he asked himself.  It must have had some practical use for it's too \par
damn ugly to be ornamental.  He shook his head.  Amanda will know.  If anyone \par
can tell me where this thing came from, she can.\par
\tab Nick walked across his bedroom to the sliding glass doors and opened the \par
curtains.  It was almost sunrise.  Beyond the small balcony outside he could see \par
the beach and the ocean.  His condominium was on the third floor and had an \par
unspoiled view of the quiet surf.  Above the water a couple of brown pelicans \par
soared in graceful formation, waiting for a chance to descend into the water and \par
catch some unsuspecting fish swimming too close to the surface.  Nick watched a \par
couple in their seventies walking slowly along the beach.  They were holding \par
hands and talking quietly; a couple of times the woman broke away to pick up a \par
shell or two and put it in a small Ziploc bag.\par
\tab Nick turned away from the door and grabbed the jeans that he had dropped \par
on the floor the night before.  He pulled them on over his undershorts and \par
walked into the living room carrying the bag with the trident.  He put the \par
golden object carefully on the table where he could study it, and then went back \par
into the open kitchen to start the coffee maker and turn on the radio.\par
\tab Except for the books, Nick's living room was decorated just like hundreds \par
of Florida seaside condominiums.  The couch and easy chair were comfortable and \par
bright, cream in color with a couple of light green ferns in the pattern for \par
decoration.  Two small paintings of water birds standing on an empty beach \par
adorned the otherwise empty walls.  Light beige drapes that matched the carpet \par
framed the long sliding glass doors that led to the balcony with the rattan \par
patio furniture.\par
\tab It was the books that gave the apartment some individuality.  Along the \par
wall opposite the couch, between the living room and the bedroom, was the large \par
wood bookcase.  It stretched almost all the way from the sliding glass doors in \par
front of the balcony to the bedroom door.  Although the general appearance of \par
the apartment was one of disarray (newspapers and sports magazines strewn about \par
here and there on the coffee table, clothes and towels on the floor in the \par
bedroom and the bathroom, dirty dishes in the sink, the dishwasher standing open \par
half full of dishes), the bookcase area was clearly well maintained.  Altogether \par
there must have been four or five hundred books on the four shelves of the long \par
bookcase, all paperbacks, virtually all novels, and all carefully filed \par
according to category.\par
\tab In front of each group of books, Scotch-taped to the outside of the \par
bookshelf, was a sheet of paper identifying the category.  Nick had finished A \par
Fan's Notes on the boat on Thursday and had already put it back in its proper \par
place on the shelf (in the category of "American, 20th Century, A-G") right next \par
to a dozen or more books by William Faulkner.  He had then selected for his \par
bedtime reading a nineteenth-century French novel, Madame Bovary, by Gustave \par
Flaubert.  Nick had read the book once before, during his sophomore year at \par
Harvard, and had not thought that much about it.  However, he had been recently \par
surprised to find the book on several lists of the ten finest novels of all \par
time, ranking right up there with such masterpieces as Crime and Punishment by \par
Dostoevsky.  Hmm.  Perhaps I missed something the first time, he had told \par
himself the previous night before deciding to read it again.\par
\tab But Nick had not been able to focus on the magnificently detailed \par
descriptions of life in provincial France a hundred and fifty years earlier.  As \par
he had followed the story of the lovely Emma Bovary, a woman for whom the \par
stultifying sameness of her life was cause enough to have affairs that would \par
eventually scandalize her village, the excitement of Nick's own life, for once, \par
kept intruding.  He was unable to suspend himself in the novel.  His mind kept \par
returning to the possibilities offered by the golden object in the exercise bag.\par
\tab Nick turned the object over and over in his hands while he drank his \par
morning coffee.  Then he had an idea.  He walked back to the second bedroom, \par
just opposite the kitchen and next to the laundry room, and opened the closet \par
door.  Nick used most of this closet as a storage area.  In the corner of the \par
closet were four huge cardboard boxes of junk that he had brought with him when \par
he had bought the condominium seven years earlier.  He had never opened them \par
even once in the intervening time.  But he did remember that in one of those \par
boxes were a bunch of photographs of the objects they had brought up from the \par
Santa Rosa.  Maybe if I look at those pictures, he thought to himself as he \par
struggled to find the right container in the dimly lit closet, I will see \par
something that looks like that thing.\par
\tab He finally located the correct box and dragged it out into the middle of \par
the living room.  At one time its contents might have been well organized, for \par
there were manila folders with filing labels inside.  But almost all of the \par
papers and photos and newspaper clippings had fallen out of their original \par
places and were now scattered around the box in a loose jumble.  Nick reached in \par
and pulled out a clipping from the Miami Herald.  It was yellow from age and had \par
been crammed down into one of the corners.  Five people, including Nick, were \par
featured in a big photograph on the front page.\par
\tab Nick stopped for a moment and looked at the photo and the caption.  Has it \par
really been that long?  he wondered, Almost eight years since we found the Santa \par
Rosa.  The caption identified the five individuals in the photograph as the crew \par
of the Neptune, a dive and salvage boat that had found an old Spanish ship named \par
the Santa Rosa sunk in the Gulf of Mexico about fifteen miles north of the Dry \par
Tortugas.  Gold and silver objects worth more than two million dollars had been \par
retrieved from the vessel and were piled in front of the happy smiling crew.  \par
From left to right they were Greta Erhard, Jake Lewis, Homer Ashford, Ellen \par
Ashford, and Nick Williams.\par
\tab That was before they started eating, Nick thought to himself.  Ellen ate \par
because of Greta, because it gave her an excuse in her own mind for what was \par
happening with Homer.  And Homer ate because he could afford it.  Just like he \par
does everything else.  For some people constraints are the only thing that saves \par
them.  Give them freedom and they go berserk.\par
\tab Nick dug deeper into the box, looking for a set of twenty or so \par
photographs that showed most of the large gold items they had retrieved from the \par
Santa Rosa.  Eventually he started finding some of the pictures, in groups of \par
four or five, in different parts of what was now becoming a hopeless pile at the \par
bottom of the box.  Each time he would find some more photos, he would pull them \par
out, look at them carefully, and then shake his head to acknowledge that the \par
golden trident did not look a thing like any of the objects from the Santa Rosa.\par
\tab At the bottom of the box Nick encountered a yellow manila folder with a \par
rubber band wrapped carefully around it.  Thinking at first that this folder \par
might contain the rest of the pictures from the Santa Rosa, Nick pulled out the \par
folder and opened it hastily.  An 8 x 11 picture of a beautiful woman in her \par
early thirties slid out and fell on the living room floor.  It was followed by \par
handwritten notes, cards, a few letters in envelopes, and then about twenty \par
sheets of bond paper covered with double-spaced typing.  Nick sighed.  How was \par
it possible that he hadn't recognized this folder?\par
\tab The woman in the portrait had long black hair, lightly frosted in the \par
front.  She was wearing a dark red cotton blouse, slightly open at the top to \par
show a triple strand of pearls just under the neck.  In blue ink that contrasted \par
with the red of the blouse, someone with magnificent, clearly artistic hand-\par
writing had written, "Mon Cher \emdash  Je t'aime, Monique," across the lower right \par
portion of the photograph.\par
\tab Nick bent down on his knees to pick up the scattered contents of the \par
folder.  He looked at the portrait carefully, his heart skipping a few beats as \par
he remembered how beautiful she had been.  He started to sort the typed pages \par
together.  At the top of one of the pages was written, in all capital letters, \par
"MONIQUE," and then underneath it, "by Nicholas C. Williams." He started to \par
read.\par
\tab "The wonder of life lies in its unpredictability.  Each of our lives is \par
irrevocably changed by the things we cannot have possibly forecast.  We walk out \par
of the door every morning to go to work or to class or even to the grocery \par
store, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we return without anything having \par
happened that we will remember even a month in the future.  On those days our \par
lives are swept up in the banality of living, in the basic humdrum cadence of \par
everyday existence.  It is the other day, the magic day, for which we live.\par
\tab "On this magic day our character becomes defined, our growth is \par
accelerated, our emotional transitions are made.  Sometimes, maybe once in a \par
lifetime, there will be a string of these magic days, one after another, so full \par
of life and change and challenge that we are completely transformed by the \par
experience and our souls become suffused with a boundless joy.  During that time \par
we are often overcome by the simple and incredible miracle of just being alive.  \par
This is the story of one such magic period.\par
\tab "It was spring break in Fort Lauderdale.  Our swimming season had just \par
finished at Harvard and my uncle, as a present for my twenty-first birthday, \par
offered to let me use his condominium in Florida for a couple of weeks so I \par
could unwind from the twin rigors of studying and swimming practice .  .  ."\par
\tab Nick had not looked at these pages for almost ten years.  As he read the \par
first few paragraphs he remembered, vividly, the ecstasy in which they were \par
written.  It was two nights before the party.  She was at some social function \par
that night, would be too late, would come by first thing in the morning.  I \par
couldn't sleep.  It was the first night in a week I had been away from her.  He \par
stopped for a moment, old emotions twisting around inside him, making him feel \par
dizzy and slightly nauseous.  He read the first paragraph again.  It was also \par
before the pain.  Before the incredible goddamn pain.\par
\tab For almost thirty minutes music had been playing on the radio.  Nick had \par
heard it, he knew it was there, but he could not have identified any of the \par
songs.  It had been background music.  Now, just at the moment when his memories \par
of Monique were the most poignant, the Miami "classic rock and roll station, \par
WMIM, 99.9 on your FM dial," played Cyndi Lauper's haunting 1984 hit "Time After \par
Time."  The music seemed to increase markedly in amplitude.  Nick had to sit \par
down and grab a breath.  Until the song, he had been able to deal with his \par
memories of Monique.  But somehow that song, the one he had played on the \par
cassette player in his car almost every night as he had made the drive from Fort \par
Lauderdale to Palm Beach to see her, carried with it all the youthful love, joy, \par
fear, and anger that had marked the entire affair.  Nick was overwhelmed.  As he \par
sat on the couch and listened to the song, hot tears welled up in his eyes and \par
then ran softly down his cheeks.\par
\tab ".  .  .  Lying in my bed, I hear the clock tick, and think of you .  .  .  \par
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new .  .  .  Flashback, warm nights, \par
almost left behind .  .  .  Suitcase of memories .  .  .  Time after Time."\par

\par
YOU say, go slow, I fall behind.  .  .  .  The second hand unwinds .  .  ."  \par
Brenda leaned over and turned the volume down on the cassette player.  "It's me, \par
Mr. Stubbs, honest.  Brenda Goldfine.  Don't you recognize me?"  She was \par
shouting at an old man in a blue uniform who was sitting on a stool in a small \par
circular tower in the middle of the road.  "And that's Teresa Silver in the \par
back.  She's not feeling too well.  Come on, open the gate and let us through."\par
\tab The security guard climbed down from his stool and slowly walked out in \par
front of Nick's old Pontiac.  He wrote the license number down on a note pad and \par
then came around to Brenda's window.  "All right this time, Brenda, but this is \par
not according to the rules.  All visitors coming into Windsor Cove after ten \par
o'clock at night must be cleared ahead of time."\par
\tab At length the guard raised the gate and Nick moved his car forward again.  \par
"The guy's really a pain in the ass," Brenda said to Nick, smacking her gum as \par
she talked, "Christ, you'd think he owned one of the places or something."  Nick \par
had heard about Windsor Cove.  Or rather had read about it.  Once when he was \par
over at his uncle's home in Potomac, Maryland, there had been a copy of Town and \par
Country magazine on the table and he had read about the "gracious life of \par
Windsor Cove."  Now, as he drove past the estates in the most prestigious \par
section of Palm Beach, he was awed by the personal wealth displayed.\par
\tab "Over there.  That's Teresa's house." Brenda pointed at a colonial house \par
set back about a hundred yards from the road.  Nick drove into the long \par
semicircular driveway and eventually stopped in front of a walkway leading to \par
the front of the house.  It was an imposing place.  Two full floors, six white \par
columns over twenty feet high, an opulent door whose top half was an arched, \par
stained glass window of a white heron in flight against a blue sky filled with \par
fleecy clouds.\par
\tab Brenda looked in the back of the car where her friend was passed out.  \par
"Look, I'd better handle this.  I'll go up and talk to Mrs. Silver and explain \par
what happened and everything.  Otherwise you could be in deep shit.  Sometimes \par
she jumps to conclusions."\par
\tab By the time Brenda reached the front door to ring the bell, it had already \par
opened.  An attractive woman in a red silk blouse and a pair of chic black \par
slacks was waiting.  Nick guessed that she had probably been called by the \par
security guard.  He couldn't tell much about the conversation, but he could see \par
that Teresa's mother was asking questions.  After a couple of minutes, Brenda \par
and the woman came back to the car.  "You didn't tell me she was still passed \par
out," Nick heard a surprisingly husky voice say.  There was also some kind of \par
accent, European perhaps.  "You know, Brenda, this is absolutely the last time \par
she can go anywhere with you.  You just can't control her.  I'm not even sure \par
that you try."  The voice was angry but not strident.\par
\tab Nick opened his door and climbed out of the car.  "This is the guy I was \par
telling you about, Mrs. Silver," Brenda said.  "Without him Teresa might still \par
be lying on the beach."\par
\tab Mrs. Silver extended her hand.  Nick took it, feeling a little awkward.  \par
He didn't know how to shake hands with a woman.  "I understand that I'm in your \par
debt, young man," Mrs. Silver said graciously.  "Brenda tells me that you \par
rescued Teresa from all sorts of horrors."  The light from the street lamps \par
played about her sculptured face.  Her hand was soft, sensual.  Nick smelled \par
just a trace of perfume, something exotic.  Her eyes were fixed on his, \par
unwavering, inquisitive.\par
\tab "Yes, Ma'am," Nick said clumsily.  "I mean, well, she had had too much to \par
drink and I thought the crowd of teenagers she was with were a little bit out of \par
control." He stopped.  She was still watching him, measuring him.  He was \par
becoming agitated and didn't understand why.  "Somebody had to help her and I \par
just happened to be there .  .  ."  He trailed off weakly.\par
\tab Mrs. Silver thanked him again and turned to Brenda.  "Your mother's \par
expecting you, dear.  We'll stay out front until you get home.  Flash your \par
lights to let us know you're there."  Brenda looked happy to be dismissed.  She \par
scampered off into the night in the direction of the nearest house about a \par
hundred yards away.\par
\tab There was a momentary pause as they watched the sixteen-year-old disappear \par
into the night.  Nick found himself stealing furtive looks at Mrs. Silver's \par
profile.  An inchoate awareness of what he was feeling made him more nervous.  \par
Jesus, she's beautiful.  And young.  How could she be the girl's mother?  He was \par
wrestling with a jumble of thoughts as he saw the lights flicker in the \par
distance.\par
\tab "Good," she said, turning to Nick with a smile, "Brenda's home.  Now we \par
can worry about Teresa."  She stopped for a moment and laughed.  "Oh, I almost \par
forgot.  We haven't been formally introduced.  I'm Teresa's mother, Monica \par
Silver."\par
\tab "I'm Nick Williams," he said in response.  Her dark eyes were fixed on him \par
again.  In the reflected light the expression in her eyes seemed to vary.  One \par
moment she was a pixie, then a seductress, then a very proper Palm Beach society \par
woman.  Or was Nick imagining it?  He couldn't return her gaze anymore.  He felt \par
his cheeks flush as he averted his eyes.\par
\tab "I had to carry her from the beach to the parking lot," Nick said \par
abruptly, as he went around to the back door of his car and opened it.  The \par
teenager had been leaning against the door and nearly fell out.  She didn't \par
stir.  He picked Teresa up and threw her over his shoulder.  "So it's no problem \par
for me to carry her for you now.  I'm used to it."\par
\tab They walked quietly down the path toward the house, Monica Silver leading \par
by a few steps.  Nick watched her walk in front of him.  She moved effortlessly, \par
like a dancer, with almost perfect posture.  Her dark hair was wrapped up at the \par
back in a chignon.  It must be very long, he thought to himself with delight, \par
imagining her hair flowing down her beautiful back.\par
\tab It was a warm and humid Palm Beach evening.  Nick was sweating by the time \par
they reached the entrance.  "Could you do me one more favor, Nick?"  Mrs. Silver \par
asked.  "Could you carry her up to her room?  My husband's not here and the help \par
has all gone to bed.  And I doubt seriously if she's going to get herself \par
together well enough to climb the stairs, even with my help, in the near \par
future."\par
\tab Nick followed Mrs. Silver's instructions and carried Teresa through the \par
atrium, into the living room, up the entry steps onto the platform, up the left \par
flight to the second floor, and then into her bedroom.  It was huge.  In her \par
room Teresa had a king-size bed with four posters, a giant television, an entire \par
cabinet of movies for the VCR, and a sound system that would have been a credit \par
to any rock and roll band.  Bruce Springsteen posters and photos were all over \par
the room.  Nick laid Teresa gently on her bed.  She murmured "Thank you," \par
indicating to him that at least she was semiconscious.  Her mother bent over her \par
and gave her a kiss.\par
\tab Nick left the two of them alone and went back down the stairs into the \par
living room.  He could not believe that somebody really could live in a house \par
like this.  Why the living room alone was bigger than the house in Falls Church \par
where he grew up.  He wandered around the room after he came down the stairs.  \par
There were original paintings on the walls, crystal glass chandeliers hanging \par
from the ceiling, and art objects and bric-a-brac both on the tables and in \par
every nook and cranny.  It was all too much for him.  He was overwhelmed.\par
\tab He felt a hand on his shoulder and involuntarily recoiled.  Monica Silver \par
chided him, "Goodness, you're jumpy.  It's only me.  " He turned around to look \par
at her Was he imagining it or had she somehow combed her hair and put on fresh \par
makeup in the few seconds they had been separated?  For the first time he saw \par
her in the full light.  She was the most beautiful woman that he had ever seen.  \par
His breath was taken away and he felt giddy.  Outside he had not been able to \par
see her skin clearly.  Now he found himself staring at her bare arms, following \par
the elegant contours of her neck.  Her skin had the smoothness of ivory.  It \par
called to him to touch it.  Watch yourself, Williams, he heard a voice inside \par
him say, Or you are going to be outrageous.  He tried to calm himself.\par
\tab But it was useless.  He could not take his eyes off her.  She was saying \par
something.  She had asked him a question.  He had not even heard it, so \par
dumbfounded was he by what was happening, by where he was.  She was leading him \par
somewhere in the house.  His imagination was running wild.  She took him into a \par
small room with a table and told him to sit down.\par
\tab "It's the least I can do," she was saying, "to repay you for what you did \par
for Teresa.  I know you must be hungry.  And we still have some great food left \par
over from the party tonight."\par
\tab Nick was in a breakfast nook just off the kitchen.  To his left a door led \par
to the patio and then outside, into the back yard.  The lights around the huge \par
swimming pool were still on.  He could see manicured gardens with roses in \par
bloom, chaise longues, colorful umbrellas, white iron tables with twisted, lacy \par
legs \emdash  he could not believe that it was all real.  He felt transported to \par
another world, a world that existed only in books and movies.\par
\tab Monica Silver laid out some food on the table.  Smoked salmon, onions, \par
capers, cream cheese, two different kinds of bread, plus a dish of some other \par
kind of fish that Nick did not recognize.  "That's marinated herring," she said \par
with a smile, noticing Nick's quizzical expression.  She handed him a wine \par
glass.  He took it and unconsciously looked her straight in the eyes.  He was \par
transfixed.  He felt weak and powerless, as if he were being drawn into her deep \par
brown, bewitching eyes, into her world of richness and luxury and beauty.  His \par
knees were weak, his heart was racing, he could feel his fingers tingling\par
\tab She poured some white wine in his glass and then in her own.  "This is a \par
brilliant Burgundy, Clos des Mouches," she said, touching her glass to his with \par
a light tinkle.  "Let's make a toast."\par
\tab She was radiant.  He was enthralled.  "To happiness," she said.\par
\par
\tab They talked for over three hours.  Nick learned that Monica Silver had \par
grown up in France, that her father had been a small, struggling fur merchant in \par
Paris, and that she had met her husband, Aaron (the biggest of the big Montreal \par
furriers), while helping her father at the shop.  She had been seventeen at the \par
time of the whirlwind courtship.  Mr: Silver had proposed just seven days after \par
they had met and she had accepted immediately even though her husband-to-be was \par
twenty years older.  She moved to Montreal and married him before she was \par
eighteen.  Teresa was born nine months later.\par
\tab Nick told her that he was in his junior year at Harvard, majoring in \par
English and French to get a good liberal arts education and prepare himself for \par
either law school or graduate school.  As soon as she found out that he was in \par
his third year of French, she switched and spoke to him in her native language.  \par
Her name became Monique.  He missed some of what she said, but it didn't matter.  \par
He understood the gist of it.  And her dramatic voice plus the sound of the \par
foreign language only increased the power of the spell already cast by the wine \par
and her beauty.\par
\tab Nick also tried to speak French from time to time.  Whatever self-\par
consciousness he might have ordinarily felt was swept away by the magic of the \par
setting and their growing rapport.  They laughed together easily at his \par
mistakes.  She was gracious and charming when she corrected him, always adding \par
"mais vous parlez fran,cais tres bien" in the early part of the evening.  Later, \par
as their conversation became more personal (Nick talked about his problems with \par
his father; Monique wondered aloud if there was anything a mother could do with \par
a teenage daughter except hope that some basic values had been learned), Monique \par
changed to the more personal "tu" form in talking to him.  This established an \par
additional intimacy between them that deepened in the wee hours of the morning.\par
\tab Monique talked about Paris, about the romance of the streets, the bistros, \par
the museums, the history.  Nick visualized it all and felt transported with her \par
to the city of lights.  She told about her dreams when she was growing up, about \par
walking in the sixteenth arrondissement among the wealthy and promising herself \par
that someday .  .  .  He listened closely, enraptured, an almost beatific smile \par
upon his face.  In the end, Monique had to tell him that it was time to go \par
because she had an early tennis lesson in the morning.  It was after three \par
o'clock.  He apologized as they walked together to the door.  She laughed and \par
said that it had been fun.  At the door she reached up and kissed him on the \par
cheek.  His heart soared out of his body at the touch of her lips.  "Call me \par
sometime," she said with a playful smile, as she closed the door behind him\par
\tab For over thirty hours Nick thought of nothing but Monique.  He talked to \par
her in his mind during the day; she was his lover in dreams at night.  He called \par
her once, twice, three times, each time talking to her answering machine.  The \par
third time he left her his phone number and address and suggested that she try \par
to get in touch with him when her schedule would permit.\par
\tab By noon on the second day after his evening at the Silvers' Palm Beach \par
mansion, he started to calm down, to realize that there was no sense in his \par
continuing to worship the image of a woman he had met for a single evening.  \par
Especially a woman who was married to someone else.  In the late afternoon he \par
went out on the beach to play volleyball with some of the other college students \par
he had met during his first days in Florida.  He had just served an ace when he \par
thought he heard his name being called by a husky, accented voice that was \par
absolutely unmistakable.\par
\tab He thought for a moment he was dreaming.  Standing in the sand not ten \par
yards away was Monique.  She was wearing a bright red and white striped bikini \par
and her long black hair hung down her back to just above her waist.  The \par
volleyball game stopped.  His friends whistled.  He walked over to her his heart \par
pounding in his temples and his breath struggling to find its way out of his \par
constricted chest.  Monique smiled and slid her arm through his.  She explained \par
that she had brought Teresa into Lauderdale for a small high school party and \par
since it was so hot .  .  .\par
\tab They walked along, the beach and talked as the sun set behind the \par
condominiums.  They were oblivious to the young people all around them.  The \par
gentle waves washed their feet with warm water as they walked.  Monique insisted \par
that they eat in Nick's condo, so they stopped for tuna fish, tomatoes, onions, \par
and mayonnaise to put on their sandwiches.  Cold beer, potato chips, and \par
sandwiches on a bare formica table was the dinner.  Lovemaking was the dessert.  \par
Nick almost had an orgasm on their first kiss and his passion made him klutzy \par
and funny in trying to remove her bikini.  Monique slowed him down, smiled \par
softly, neatly folded her bikini and his bathing suit (while he of course was \par
going wild), and then came to join him on the bed.  After two kisses naked on \par
the bed, Nick was seized by a paroxysm of lust.  He rolled roughly on top of \par
Monique and began gyrating with his hips.  At first a bit alarmed, Monique \par
slowed him just a bit and guided him gently into her.\par
\tab Monique's body was nearly perfect.  Nice, full, upright breasts (they had \par
been reconstructed of course after she had nursed Teresa but how could Nick have \par
known or cared?) slim waist, rounded, feminine ass (not one of those boyish \par
asses that really skinny women have), taut muscled legs kept in shape with lots \par
of exercise.  But it was her skin, that magnificent ivory skin, that sent Nick \par
into ecstasy.  It was so soft and easy to the touch.\par
\tab Her mouth seemed to fit his perfectly.  Nick had been with two women \par
before, a high-priced call girl given to him as a Christmas present after the \par
Harvard swimming team had discovered he was still a virgin at the end of his \par
freshman year and Jennifer Barnes from Radcliffe, his sometimes steady date \par
during most of his sophomore year.  Jennifer's teeth always clanged against his \par
when they kissed.  But that had not been the only difficulty in his relationship \par
with Jennifer.  She was a physicist and her approach to sex had been almost \par
clinical.  She measured sizes and durations and frequencies and even quantities \par
of ejaculant.  After three "scheduled performances" with Jenny Nick had decided \par
it wasn't worth it.\par
\tab Nick gasped as he slid into Monique.  Both of them knew it would be over \par
soon.  Ten seconds later Nick finished his climax and started to withdraw.  But \par
Monique held his rear firmly in her hands, keeping him in place, and deftly (how \par
did she do it?) rolled over so that she was on top.  Nick was now out of his \par
element.  In his limited experience, withdrawal was the next step after orgasm.  \par
He didn't know what Monique was doing.  Ever so slowly, her eyes half closed as \par
she hummed a piece of classical music to herself, Monique rocked back and forth \par
on top of him, her vaginal walls holding tightly to his now flaccid penis.  \par
After a couple of minutes she began to grind her pelvis forward as she rocked \par
and, much to Nick's amazement, as her breath shortened he found himself becoming \par
aroused again.  Now her eyes closed altogether and her rhythm became stronger, \par
the thrusts of her forward motion grinding with a little pain into his bones.  \par
Nick was now definitely erect and he started following her motion, lightly \par
gyrating in pattern with her.\par
\tab Monique leaned forward, concentrating but smiling with her eyes closed, \par
preparing for her own orgasm.  She was acutely aware and delighted that Nick was \par
up again.  Timing her own progress perfectly (and in complete control of the \par
situation), she adroitly and softly reached down and began titillating Nick's \par
nipples in rhythm with her forward thrusts.  Nick had never had his breasts \par
touched in lovemaking before and was shocked.  But the raw excitement was \par
overwhelming.  She increased her play, even pinching him when she saw (and felt) \par
his response.  As wave after wave of delightful release coursed through her \par
body, Nick uttered a loud, wailing scream and had his second orgasm in fifteen \par
minutes.  At the end of the climax he was completely given over to pleasure and \par
made animal sounds and shook involuntarily from exhausted satiety.\par
\tab Nick was a little embarrassed by his noisy and uncontrolled response, but \par
Monique's playful and friendly afterplay assured him that everything was all \par
right.  She went to his closet, pulled out one of his three dress shirts, and \par
put it on.  The tails came almost down to her knees (Monique was only five feet \par
five and Nick was a shade less than six two) and she looked positively gamine \par
with her pixie smile, long hair, and man's shirt.  Nick began to declare his \par
love but Monique came forward and put her finger to his lips.  Then she kissed \par
him lovingly, told him that she needed to pick up Teresa, jumped in the shower \par
for what could not have been more than a minute, dressed, kissed him again, and \par
walked out the door.  Nick did not move during this entire time.  After she left \par
he fell asleep contentedly.  He did not dream.\par
\tab For the next eight days Nick was on top of the world.  He saw Monique \par
every day, most of the time at her Palm Beach mansion, but sometimes at his \par
uncle's condominium.  They made love at every opportunity and it was always \par
different.  Monique was full of surprises.  The second time Nick went to her \par
house, for example, he found her in the back, swimming naked in the pool.  She \par
told him that she had given all the servants the day off.  Within minutes they \par
were frolicking and laughing on the grass between the garden and the pool.\par
\tab Their affair was conducted in French.  Monique taught him about food and \par
wine.  They shared their knowledge of French literature.  One passionate night \par
they argued about Andre Gide's La Symphonie Pastorale both before and after \par
lovemaking.  Monique defended the pastor and laughed at Nick's insistence that \par
the blind Gertrude was "an innocent.  " Another evening, when Monique demanded \par
that Nick wear a black Halloween mask and a pair of white leotards throughout \par
their long French dinner, they read Jean Genet's Le Balcon together as a prelude \par
to sex.\par
\tab The days raced by relentlessly, clothed in the magic of love and intimacy.  \par
Once Nick showed up at the mansion and Monique greeted him dressed in an \par
incredible coat, a full-length Alaskan seal fur with indigo fox trim around the \par
collars as well as down the lapels and framing the sleeves from the shoulders to \par
the wrists.  The coat was the softest thing Nick had ever touched, even softer \par
than her tantalizing skin.  His playful paramour had turned the air conditioning \par
up as high as it would go so that she could wear her favorite coat.  She was \par
wearing nothing underneath it.  After lovemaking that evening she dressed Nick's \par
naked body in one of her husband's beaver coats, explaining the presence of half \par
a dozen fur coats in Palm Beach with a simple "it's our business and we like to \par
have some things to show our friends and acquaintances in case they are \par
interested."\par
\par
\tab Nick professed his love with increasing zeal each time they met anew.  \par
Monique responded with her usual "je t'aime," but would not reply to Nick's \par
insistent questions about the future.  She avoided all questions about her \par
relationship with Mr. Silver, except to say that he was a workaholic and that he \par
stayed in Montreal most of the year.  He had bought the place in Palm Beach \par
primarily because Monique did not like the cold and wanted a more active social \par
life than the one they had in Montreal.  Monique usually spent the period from \par
Christmas to Easter in Palm Beach; Teresa, who had just finished her spring \par
break from her exclusive private school and had returned to Canada, came down as \par
often as possible so that she could be with her mother.\par
\tab Monique gave short, terse answers about her present life.  But she waxed \par
rhapsodic about her childhood in Paris.  She never criticized her husband or \par
complained about her married life.  Yet she did tell Nick that her days with him \par
had been the happiest time of her life.  She also talked about some of her \par
friends, but Nick never met any of them.  They were always alone.\par
\tab One day she picked him up in her Cadillac and they headed toward Key Largo \par
so that he could do some diving at the Pennekamp Recreation Area.  As always, \par
she was wearing her wedding ring.  On this particular day Nick had vowed to \par
himself that he would get some answers about the future, and the constant \par
presence of her wedding ring pissed him off.  He asked her to remove it.  She \par
politely refused, then grew angry when he pressed her.  She pulled the car off \par
the highway in the marshland north of the Keys and stopped the engine\par
\tab "It is a fact that I am married," she said resolutely, "and taking the \par
ring off is not going to change anything.  I am in love with you, without doubt, \par
but you have understood my situation from the beginning.  If you cannot deal \par
with it anymore, then perhaps we should just call it quits."\par
\tab Nick was shocked by her response.  The thought of being without her \par
terrified him.  He apologized and professed his love.  He began kissing her \par
passionately and then jumped in the back seat.  He told her that he needed her \par
right then, that moment.  She somewhat reluctantly joined him and they had \par
intercourse on the back seat of her Cadillac.  Monique was quiet and pensive \par
most of the rest of the day.\par
\tab On Friday, exactly a week after they had met, Monique took Nick to a \par
tuxedo shop to have him fitted for a black tie dinner with some friends that she \par
was having on Saturday night in her home.  So finally he was going to be seen \par
with her.  "And," Nick thought, "now she will talk about our future." Nick was \par
supposed to be in Boston on Monday morning and his parents were expecting him \par
Saturday night in Falls Church, but he assured himself that he could drive all \par
day (and all night if necessary, so pumped up was he in his love for Monique) to \par
get to classes on Monday morning.\par
\tab Nick was full of hope and dreams when he showed up at the Silver mansion \par
on Saturday night.  He looked elegant in his summer tux, and the smile with \par
which he greeted Monique at the door could have won a prize.  Even with the \par
doorman standing by, he handed her a dozen red roses, gave her a kiss, and told \par
her that he loved her.  "Of course you do," she said lightly, "doesn't \par
everybody?"  She took him inside and introduced him to the four other people who \par
had also come early as the "young man who saved our Teresa one day in \par
Lauderdale."  Then Monique excused herself.  It was her fashion, Nick later \par
learned, to ask a few select friends to come early to a party, to greet them in \par
casual attire, and then to return an hour or so later, when everyone had \par
arrived, with a grand entrance.  As Monique gracefully walked up the stairs of \par
the mansion, Nick's eyes followed her with an unmistakable look of adoration.\par
\tab "Isn't she magnificent?"  Nick was asked by a relaxed, tanned man of about \par
fifty who offered him a martini.  His name was Clayton.  "Once I was with her \par
all weekend on their yacht, while Aaron was in Montreal.  I thought she had \par
invited me for a little diversion." He laughed.  "But I was wrong.  She just \par
wanted some company and I could talk about France and Europe.  Come with me (he \par
slipped his arm through Nick's) and I'll introduce you to the select group that \par
was invited early today."\par
\tab Nick was treated with extreme courtesy by the other favored guests, but he \par
was wary of their questions about Monique.  He was, after all, a Southern boy, \par
and if there was something to say about their relationship, it was her place to \par
say it.  So he answered politely but modestly and didn't elaborate at all.\par
\tab One of the two women at the bar, who introduced herself as Jane Somebody, \par
said that she was Monica's oldest friend in Palm Beach.  (They all called her \par
Monica.  It was impossible for Nick to call her anything but Monique.  Nick \par
wondered if they could guess what was going on or if Monique had told them.) \par
Jane was in her late thirties, plump and raucous, a heavy drinker and a chain \par
smoker.  She had once been fairly attractive but had lived too hard too soon.  \par
She was one of those people who touch everybody during a conversation.  She made \par
Nick nervous.\par
\tab The other guests began to arrive.  Jane and Clayton (as in Clayton \par
Poindexter III of Newport and Palm Beach.  Clayton, when asked by Nick what he \par
did, answered, "NVMS."  Nick of course had absolutely no idea what that meant.  \par
Clayton laughed.  "NVMS \emdash  No visible means of support \emdash  a term used to cover all \par
bums.") seemed to be acting as hostess and host in Monique's absence.  They \par
introduced him to everybody.  Nick had three or four martinis and told the \par
Teresa story at least seven times during the first hour that he was in the \par
Silver mansion.\par
\tab Nick was becoming fairly spiffed by this time.  He sang to himself as he \par
took another martini off the cocktail tray being proffered by one of the \par
servants.  The alcohol had buoyed his spirits and made him feel somehow \par
temporarily suave and debonair.  Nick was on the patio talking to Monique's \par
"riding partner," a lovely woman in her mid-twenties named Anne, when he heard \par
scattered applause from the living room.  "It's Monica," Anne said.  "Let's go \par
see."\par
\tab The grand stairway in the Silvers' colonial mansion rose to a platform \par
maybe six feet above the living room floor and then split, with two different \par
sets of stairs then continuing up to the second floor.  Monique was standing on \par
the platform, acknowledging the applause.  dressed in a simple navy blue knit \par
dress that seemed form-fitted to her perfect body.  The back was cut way down, \par
almost to the bottom of her spectacular hair (she turned around to please the \par
forty or so guests), and, in the front, two thin pieces of cloth ran from her \par
shoulders to her waist, covering each breast adequately but leaving plenty of \par
cleavage to be admired.  Entranced by the vision of his queen, Nick cheered \par
lustily, a little too loud, "Bravo.  Bravo."  Monique seemed not to hear his \par
cheer.  She had turned and was looking up the stairs.\par
\tab It probably took an entire minute for Nick to comprehend the sight he was \par
seeing.  A man, a distinguished-looking man in his early fifties, wearing a \par
custom-made tan tuxedo and sporting an amazing sapphire ring on his little \par
finger, came down the staircase and put his arms around Monique's waist.  She \par
reached up and kissed him.  He smiled and waved at the crowd as they politely \par
applauded.  They walked down the stairs together to the living room.\par
\tab Who is that?  Nick thought to himself and even through the gin and the \par
vermouth and all the incredible feelings the answer came back, That is her \par
husband, Aaron.  What is he doing here?  Why didn't she tell me?  And then, \par
following very swiftly, How could she do this to me?  I love her and she loves \par
me and there is something very very wrong.  This cannot be happening.\par
\tab Nick tried to breathe but felt as if a large piece of earth-moving \par
machinery were pressed against his chest.  Instinctively he turned away from the \par
sight of Monique and Aaron walking down the stairs arm in arm.  As he did he \par
spilled part of a martini on Anne's shoulder.  His apology was very clumsy.  Now \par
completely discombobulated, he stumbled over to the bar, trying desperately to \par
breathe and to stop the pounding in his chest.  No.  No.  She can't be doing \par
this.  There must be some mistake.  His mind could not read the message that his \par
eyes were transmitting.  He drank another martini swiftly, barely aware of his \par
surroundings or the jumbled feelings torturing his soul.\par
\tab "There he is."  He heard her voice behind him, the voice that had come to \par
signify everything that was valuable and important in life, the voice of love.  \par
But this time he was terrified.  Nick turned and Monique and Aaron were standing \par
right in front of him.\par
\tab "So finally I get to meet this young man I've heard so much about," he \par
said.  Aaron was pleasant, friendly, without a trace of anything but gratitude \par
in his voice.  Aaron Silver was holding out his hand.  Monique was smiling.  \par
God, she's so beautiful.  Even now, when I should hate her.  Nick mechanically \par
shook Aaron's hand and quietly accepted his thanks for "helping Teresa at a \par
difficult time." Nick said nothing.  He turned to look at Monique.  She reached \par
up and kissed him on the cheek.  Oh those lips.  How I long still for those \par
lips.  Why?  Why?  What happens to us now?\par
\tab Nick suddenly realized that there were tears in his eyes.  Ohmygod .  I'm \par
going to cry.  Embarrassed beyond measure, Nick abruptly excused himself and \par
walked out onto the patio.  Now the tears were running down his cheeks.  He was \par
afraid he was going to sit down on the grass and start bawling like a baby \par
Confused, puzzled, he walked around the garden with his head down and tried, \par
without success, to draw a regular breath.\par
\tab He felt a hand on his elbow.  It was Jane, the last person on Earth that \par
Nick wanted to see at this moment.  "She'll be out to see you in a few minutes.  \par
First she and Aaron have to make the rounds, you know how it is at parties when \par
you're the hostess."  Jane lit a cigarette.  Nick was certain he was going to \par
puke.  He turned quickly to ask her to put out the cigarette and he lost his \par
equilibrium.\par
\tab Maybe it was the drink, maybe the adrenaline, maybe it was just too much.  \par
Nick's head was spinning around and around.  He inadvertently leaned against \par
Jane for support.  She misunderstood, and then pulled his head to her shoulder.  \par
"There, there," she said.  "Don't take it so hard.  You and Monique will still \par
be able to have some time together.  Aaron will only be here for a couple of \par
days and then he'll go back to Montreal to work.  Besides," she said with gusto, \par
"if you're anywhere near as good as Monica says you are, I'd be delighted to \par
take care of you when she's with Aaron."\par
\tab Nick pushed her away and staggered back.  He felt as if he had just been \par
hit in the face with a sledgehammer.  The full impact of Jane's comment sunk in \par
slowly and an uncontrollable mixture of anger and hurt surged to the surface.  \par
What?  What?  She knows.  This cloying bitch knows.  Maybe they all know.  What?  \par
Fuck.  Fuck this altogether.  And then, almost immediately, as his mind began to \par
take the measure of the evening's events, How do I get out of here?  Where is \par
the exit?  As he walked around the house to the front (he was not about to go \par
inside again), from deep inside Nick there now came a sound, a sound that welled \par
up to the surface and could not be contained.  This was the wail of pain, the \par
unmitigated and ineluctable cry of the animal in total despair.  Millennia of \par
acculturation have made it rare to hear such cries from human beings.  But this \par
loud and untoward scream, which rose into the Palm Beach night like a siren from \par
a police car, gave Nick his first comfort.  While the partygoers were trying to \par
decide what they had heard, Nick climbed into his 1977 Pontiac and drove away.\par
\tab He drove south toward Fort Lauderdale, his heart still pumping like crazy \par
and his body trembling from adrenaline.  He didn't think about anything \par
coherently.  The pictures in his mind seemed to come at random, without any \par
clear connection between them.  Monique was the focus of all the pictures in the \par
montage.  Monique in her Alaskan seal coat, Monique in her red and white bathing \par
suit, Monique in her dress tonight (Nick winced, for just off-screen left in his \par
mind's eye, he could see Aaron coming down the stairs).  Had it all been \par
meaningless? Was it just a game?  Nick was too young to know about the grays of \par
life.  For him it was a simple question of black or white.  It was either \par
wonderful or it was shit.  Monique either loved him passionately and wanted to \par
give up her luxurious life to marry him, or she was just using him to satisfy \par
her sexual needs and her ego.  So, he concluded, as he arrived at his uncle's \par
condominium in Fort Lauderdale, I was another of her toys.  I was like her furs \par
and horses and yachts and clothes.  I made her feel good.\par
\tab Disgusted with himself, depressed beyond belief, a headache starting to \par
tear his brain apart from the martinis, Nick rapidly packed his clothes.  He \par
didn't bathe or eat.  He took his two suitcases down to the car, left the rented \par
tuxedo with the managers of the complex, and drove out toward Interstate 95.  A \par
couple of miles before he reached the freeway, Nick pulled the car off on the \par
shoulder and allowed himself a few tears.  That was all.  The external hardness \par
that would characterize the next ten years of his life began at that moment.  \par
Never again, he said to himself.  I will never again let some bitch make a fool \par
of me.  No way, Jose`.\par
\tab Ten years later, early on a March morning in his condominium in Key West, \par
Nick Williams would idly play with a metallic golden object sitting on his \par
coffee table and experience again the terrible pain of seeing Monique with her \par
husband at that party.  Wistfully, with some mature chagrin, he would remember \par
also how, when he reached 1-95, he turned left and south toward Miami and the \par
Keys instead of right and north toward Boston.  He couldn't have explained why \par
at the time.  He might have said that Harvard was trivial after Monique or that \par
he wanted to study life and not books.  He didn't understand that his need to \par
start absolutely fresh came from the fact that he could not face himself.\par
\tab He had not played the memory of Monique through from start to finish for \par
five years.  This morning, for the first time, Nick had been able to distance \par
himself from the recalled emotions, ever so slightly, and to see the entire \par
affair with a tiny bit of perspective.  He recognized that his blind youthful \par
passion had set him up for the anguish, but he was still reluctant to find \par
Monique faultless.  At least the memory no longer destroyed him.  He picked up \par
the trident and walked to the window.  Maybe it's all coming together now, he \par
said to himself.  A new treasure.  A final molting of the last adolescent angst.  \par
He thought about Carol Dawson.  She was vexing but her intensity fascinated him.  \par
Always the dreamer, Nick visualized Carol in his arms and imagined the warmth \par
and softness of her kiss.\par
\par
\par
3\par
\par
CAROL watched in fascination as the octopus captured its prey with its long \par
tentacles.  "Imagine what it would be like to have eight arms," Oscar Burcham \par
said.  "Just think of the brain architecture necessary to separate all the \par
inputs, to identify which stimulus was coming from which limb, to coordinate all \par
the tentacles in defense or acquisition of food."\par
\tab Carol laughed and turned to her companion.  They were standing in front of \par
a large.  translucent glass window inside a dimly lit building.  "Oh, Oscar," \par
she said to the old man with the bright eyes, "you never change.  Only you can \par
think of all these living creatures as biological systems with architectures.  \par
Don't you ever wonder about their feelings, their dreams while they are \par
sleeping, their concepts of death?"\par
\tab "Aye, well I do," Oscar replied with a twinkle in his eye.  "But it's \par
virtually impossible for human beings, even with a common language and developed \par
communications skills, to truly describe their feelings.  How could we even know \par
or appreciate, for example, a dolphin's sense of loneliness?  In our maudlin way \par
we ascribe to them human emotions, which is ridiculous."  He paused for a moment \par
to think.  "No," he continued, "it's more fruitful to conduct scientific inquiry \par
at levels where we can understand the answers.  In the long run, I believe that \par
knowing how these creatures function, in the scientific sense, is more likely to \par
lead us to their emotional quotients than conducting psychological experiments \par
whose outcomes cannot be interpreted."\par
\tab Carol reached over and kissed him fondly.  "You take everything I say so \par
seriously, Oscar.  Even when I'm kidding, you always pay attention to my \par
comments."  She stopped and looked away.  "You're the only one who does."\par
\tab Oscar pulled back dramatically and put both his hands on Carol's right \par
shoulder.  "Somewhere here there's a chip .  .  .  I know it for a fact .  .  .  \par
It's almost always here .  .  .  Ah, I found it." He looked at her knowingly.  \par
"It's not becoming, you know.  Here you are, a successful, even celebrated \par
reporter, still suffering from what could only be described as terminal \par
insecurity.  What's this about?  Did you and the boss have a big fight this \par
morning?"\par
\tab "No," Carol replied, as they walked across the room to another part of the \par
aquarium.  "Well, sort of I guess.  You know how he is.  He takes over \par
everything.  I'm working on this big story down in Key West.  Dale comes to the \par
airport to pick me up, takes me out to breakfast, and proceeds to tell me \par
exactly what I should be doing to cover my assignment.  His suggestions are \par
almost all good, and I appreciate his help on the technical issues, but it's the \par
way he talks to me.  As if he thinks I'm stupid or something."\par
\tab Oscar looked at her intently.  "Carol, my dear, he talks to everybody that \par
way, including me.  He doesn't mean anything by it.  He is absolutely convinced \par
of his own superiority and nothing has ever happened in his life to change his \par
mind.  He was a millionaire from his own patents before he graduated from MIT."\par
\tab Carol was impatient and frustrated.  "I know all that, Oscar, believe me, \par
I know.  But you're protecting him again.  Dale and I have been lovers for \par
almost a year.  He tells everybody how proud of me he is, how much he enjoys \par
being stimulated by my mind.  But when we're together, he treats me like a fool.  \par
This morning he even argued with me about what I was having for breakfast.  For \par
Christ's sake, I've been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize but the guy who wants to \par
marry me doesn't think I can order my own breakfast."\par
\tab They were standing in front of a large tank with crystal-clear water.  \par
About half a dozen small whales were swimming in circles around the tank, \par
occasionally going to the surface for air.  "You came and asked my opinion in \par
the beginning, my young friend," he said quietly.  "And I told you that I \par
thought your souls were not compatible.  Do you remember what you said to me?"\par
\tab "Yes," she answered with a rueful smile.  "I asked you what the chief \par
scientist of MOI could possibly know about souls.  I'm sorry, Oscar.  I was \par
sorry at the time.  I was so headstrong.  Dale looked great on paper and I \par
wanted your approval \emdash  "\par
\tab "Forget it," he interrupted her.  "You know how I feel about you.  But \par
never underestimate a scientist.  Some of them," he said abstractedly, "want to \par
know facts and concepts so that ultimately they can understand the overall \par
nature of everything.  Including the putative soul.\par
\tab "Now take these whales," Oscar continued, increasing the tempo and \par
adroitly changing the subject.  "We have been mapping their brains for almost a \par
decade now, isolating various kinds of functions in specific locations, and \par
trying to correlate their brain structure with that of a human being.  We have \par
been reasonably successful.  The language function that governs their singing \par
has been separated and the location of the physical controls for all parts of \par
the body have been identified.  In fact, we have found an area in the whale \par
brain that corresponds to the equivalent function for every major capability in \par
the human brain.  But there's still a problem, a mystery if you will."\par
\tab One of the whales stopped in its normal circuit about the tank.  It seemed \par
to be watching them.  "There's a large section of their brain that we have been \par
unable to allocate to any specific function.  A brilliant scientist years ago, \par
after listening to the whales' songs while they were migrating and correlating \par
those songs with the rest of their behavior, postulated that this large, \par
unmapped portion of their brain was a multidimensional memory array.  His \par
hypothesis was that the whales store entire incidents in that array, including \par
sights, sounds, and even feelings, and that they relive these incidents during \par
migration to alleviate the boredom.  Our tests are starting to confirm his \par
theory."\par
\tab Carol was intrigued.  "You mean, they might put in that array the entire \par
set of sensory impressions from something important, like calving, and then \par
have, in a sense, a full instant replay during a particularly boring part of the \par
migration route?  Wow.  That's fascinating.  My memory irritates me all the \par
time.  It would be great if somehow I could go in there, in a directed sense, \par
and pull out anything I want.  Complete with feelings."  She laughed.  "There \par
have been times in the summers when I couldn't remember exactly how great it \par
felt to ski and I have almost panicked, worrying about whether or not that \par
feeling might be gone the next winter."\par
\tab Oscar waved at the whale and it swam away.  "Be careful," he said.  "Other \par
people have also thought that it would be fantastic if our memories were more \par
complete, like a computer's.  But suppose we did have a perfect, \par
multidimensional memory like that hypothesized for the whale.  And suppose we \par
had the same lack of entry control that is characteristic of human memory as it \par
now exists.  You know, where what we remember and when we remember it are not \par
under our individual control.  Then there would be problems.  We might even be \par
nonfunctional as a species.  A song, a picture, a smell, even the taste of a \par
cake might suddenly force us to confront anew the full emotions associated with \par
the death of a loved one.  We might have to see again a painful fight between \par
our parents.  Or even the trauma of our own birth."\par
\tab Oscar was quiet for a moment.  "No," he said finally, "evolution has \par
served us in good stead.  It couldn't develop an entry control mechanism for our \par
memories.  So to protect us, to keep us from being demolished by mistakes or \par
past events, evolution built a natural fade process into our memories \emdash  "\par
\tab "Carol Dawson.  Carol Dawson.  Report immediately to the audiovisual \par
conference room adjacent to the director's office."\par
\tab The loudspeaker interrupted the quiet in the MOI aquarium.  Carol gave \par
Oscar a hug.  "It's been great, Ozzie, as always," she said, watching him wince \par
as she used her pet name for him.  "But it looks like they've finished \par
developing the pictures.  Incidentally, I think the whole business about the \par
whales' memories is fascinating.  I want to come back and do a feature on it \par
Maybe next week sometime.  Give my love to your daughter and grandson."\par
\tab Carol had become so engrossed in the discussion with Oscar that she had \par
momentarily forgotten why she had flown to Miami early that morning.  Now she \par
felt anew a keen sense of excitement as she drove back to the main MOI \par
administrative building from the aquarium.  Dale had been confident at breakfast \par
that processing the infrared images would reveal something of interest.  "After \par
all," he had said logically, "the foreign object alarm was triggered repeatedly \par
And nothing could be seen in the visual images.  Therefore, either the infrared \par
observations caused the alarm or the algorithm did not work properly.  The \par
second possibility is very unlikely, since I designed the data flow myself and \par
my best programmers tested it after it was coded."\par
\tab Dale was uncharacteristically excited when she walked into the conference \par
room.  Carol started to ask him a question but was silenced by a vigorous \par
negative motion of the head that followed his smile of greeting.  Dale was \par
talking to two of the image-processing technicians.  "Okay, then, we're squared \par
away?  Display the images in this sequence.  I'll call for each one by using the \par
pickle."  The technicians left the room.\par
\tab Dale came over and grabbed Carol.  "You are not going to believe this," he \par
said, "what a bonanza.  What a fucking bonanza!"  He settled down a little.  \par
"But first things first.  I promised myself that I would not spoil it for you.  \par
"He showed her to a seat at the conference table in front of the large screen \par
and then sat down beside her.\par
\tab He pushed the remote-control switch.  Up on the large screen came a still \par
frame of the three whales in the reef area under the boat.  The fissure could \par
clearly be seen to the right and beneath the whales.  Dale looked at Carol.  "I \par
see," she shrugged, "but what's the deal?  I took pictures with my underwater \par
camera that are just as good."\par
\tab Dale turned back to the screen and pushed thc remote several more times.  \par
The successive scenes zoomed in on the hole in the coral reef, eventually \par
isolating and centering on a small glint in the lower left side of the fissure.  \par
Again Dale looked at Carol.  "I have a similar blowup," she said pensively.  \par
"But it's impossible to tell if something is really there or if it's an artifact \par
of the photographic process.  "She stopped herself.  "Although the fact that two \par
distinctly different techniques found the light in essentially the same place \par
suggests that it might not be a processing distortion."  She leaned forward, \par
interested.  "So what's next?"\par
\tab There was no way he could contain himself Dale jumped up and started \par
pacing around the room.  "What's next," he began, "could be your ticket to the \par
Pulitzer dinner in New York.  Now I am going to show you exactly the same \par
sequence of images, only these were taken in the infrared a fraction of a second \par
later.  Watch closely, especially in the center of the fissure."\par
\tab The first processed infrared image covered the same area underneath the \par
boat that the first visual image had shown.  In the infrared picture, however, \par
what was shown were thermal variations in the scene.  In the processing, each \par
pixel (an individual picture element in the image) was given a specific \par
temperature based on the infrared radiation observed from that portion of the \par
frame.  Similar temperatures were then grouped together by the computer \par
processing and assigned the same color.  This process created isothermal \par
regions, or regions of roughly the same temperature, that were visually \par
connected by color.  The result was that in the first picture the whales stood \par
out in red, most of the reef plants were blue, and the normalized water \par
temperature formed a dusky gray background.  It took Carol a moment to adjust to \par
the display.  Dale was smiling triumphantly.  Before Carol had a chance to focus \par
on two small regions, one red and another brown down in the center of the hole \par
in the reef, the zoom process had begun.  In a few seconds an infrared close-up \par
of the fissure clearly demonstrated why Dale was so excited.\par
\tab "I told you there was something under the boat," he said, walking to the \par
screen and pointing at a brown, elongated object.  The object was cylindrical at \par
one end and tapered to a point at the other.  The fissure had been blown up by \par
the zoom process so that it almost completely filled the screen.  Even with all \par
the magnification, the quality of the infrared image was superb.  Inside the \par
opening three or four different colors could be seen; however, only two, the \par
brown and the red, were continuous over a significant number of pixels\par
\tab "Holy shit," said Carol, involuntarily rising from her seat and walking \par
over to join Dale, "that brown thing must be the lost missile.  It was \par
underneath us all the time.  " She picked up the pointer and waved it at the \par
screen.  "But what's this red area?  It looks like the Cheshire cat from Alice \par
in Wonderland."\par
\tab "I'm not absolutely certain," Dale replied, "and it's probably not \par
anything of major significance.  But I do have a crazy idea.  Actually it's \par
based on what you told me about the strange behavior of the whales down there.  \par
It may be the head of another whale, back away from the light, looking out of \par
the cave.  Or whatever the opening is.  Here, look at this.  By zooming out a \par
little we obtain one single picture that shows both of the red isothermal \par
regions.  Look how the red region in the middle of the fissure and the red from \par
your sentinel whales look the same.  Even with additional stretching, the two \par
regions remain comparable in temperature.  Not a proof of any kind, but it \par
certainly supports my proposition."\par
\tab Carol's mind was racing ahead.  She was already planning her next move.  \par
It was essential that she retrieve that missile before anybody knew it was \par
there.  She needed to return to Key West as soon as possible.  She picked up her \par
purse and her briefcase.  "Can someone drive me to the airport, please, Dale?  \par
Right now.  I want to call that Lieutenant Todd again and scare him a bit.  You \par
know, make him a little more cautious and buy some time for us."\par
\tab She paused, thinking of a million things at once.  "But I can't call him \par
from here without making him suspicious .  .  .  And I must make some \par
arrangements for a boat for tomorrow  .  .  .  Oh, incidentally, I assume you \par
have hard copy of those pictures available for me."\par
\tab Dale nodded his head.  "I do," he said.  "But first sit down and relax for \par
a second.  I want to show you something else.  I don't yet know if it's a real \par
phenomenon, but if it is .  .  ."  Carol started to protest but there was \par
something in his manner that told her to acquiesce.  She sat down.  He launched \par
into a discussion of enhancement algorithms, explaining how the information in \par
pictures could be stretched to highlight special features and allow easier \par
interpretation.\par
\tab "Okay, Okay," she said at length.  "The bottom line is what I need.  I \par
know already how clever you and your engineers are."\par
\tab Dale put the first infrared image back on the screen, the one that showed \par
the full view of the three whales underneath the boat.  "This picture does not \par
have much thermal granularity.  Every pixel in the region colored red, for \par
example, does not correspond to exactly the same temperature.  In reality, the \par
spread in temperatures for the same color is roughly five degrees.  Now if we \par
stretch the image, and make the isothermal regions only cover a total spread of \par
two degrees each, we obtain this picture."\par
\tab In the new image there were ten different colors.  It was much harder to \par
see individual features, and spurious data points made the picture extremely \par
difficult to interpret.  A portion of the front of one of the whales was now a \par
different color from the rest of the animal.\par
\tab "The limit of accuracy of the equipment, by the time the raw spectral data \par
is converted to temperatures, is about one degree.  If we show another stretch \par
of the same picture, with the connected isothermal regions now only covering a \par
total range of one degree each, then the picture almost becomes gibberish.  Now \par
there are twenty different colors for the isothermal regions and, because the \par
noise or error in each data point is of the same magnitude as the spread in the \par
isothermal region, it is virtually impossible to see the figures of known \par
objects like the three whales.  I tell you all this up front to make certain you \par
realize that what I am about to show you may be completely wrong.  It is, \par
nevertheless, absolutely fascinating."\par
\tab The next image projected on the screen was a close-up down on the floor of \par
the ocean, just above the trench that Carol had followed when backtracking to \par
find the origin of the tracks.  The familiar parallel lines just barely showed \par
up in the infrared image The fissure was almost off the left side of the image.  \par
On either side of the trench, blue color broken with some occasional green \par
marked the two reefs.  Carol looked at Dale with a puzzled expression on her \par
face.\par
\tab "This close-up has the same five-degree granularity as the big reference \par
image.  There is nothing of note here."  He flashed another picture.  "Nor here, \par
where we have increased the number of colors to ten again.  But look at this."  \par
One more image went up on the screen.  The picture was very difficult to follow, \par
much less interpret.  As many as twenty different colors connected odd regions \par
in what appeared to be random patterns.  About the only thing that was regular \par
in the picture were the background rocks on which the coral and other sea life \par
were living.  And it was those background rocks that had Dale so excited.\par
\tab "This is what I wanted you to see," he said, waving his hand at the rocks \par
on the two sides of the trench.  "The two reef structures do not have the same \par
color.  For some unknown and absolutely inexplicable reason, every background \par
rock area on this reef is coded chartreuse.  On the opposite reef, just across \par
the trench a few feet away, all the background rock is yellow.  A one-degree \par
difference.  Now if some of the yellow pieces were interspersed with the \par
chartreuse, and vice versa, then I would say that the data clearly has no \par
significance and that what we are seeing are noise signatures.  But this pattern \par
is compelling."\par
\tab Carol was lost.  She could see that the rocks on one reef structure were \par
all chartreuse and that the opposite reef was yellow.  But it didn't mean \par
anything to her.  She shook her head.  She needed more explanation.\par
\tab "Don't you understand?"  Dale said with a final dramatic flourish.  "If \par
this data is right, then we have found something else of great importance.  \par
Either there is some source inside one of the reef structures that is making its \par
surface uniformly warmer, or, and I admit this sounds truly incredible, one of \par
the two is not a reef at all and is something else masquerading as a reef."\par

IT was almost always impossible to find a parking place in the middle of the \par
working day near Amanda Winchester's house in Key West.  The Hemingway Marina \par
had revitalized the old part of the city where she lived, but as usual everyone \par
had underestimated the need for parking.  All the repainted and renovated \par
nineteenth-century mansions along Eaton and Caroline streets had signs on the \par
street saying such things as DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT PARKING HERE IF YOU'RE NOT A \par
RESIDENT, but it was no use.  People who worked in the retail shops around the \par
marina parked where it was convenient for them and avoided the heavy parking fee \par
at the marina lot.\par
\tab After searching fruitlessly for a parking place for fifteen minutes, Nick \par
Williams decided to park outside of a convenience store and walk the block or so \par
to Amanda's house.  He was strangely anxious.  Part of his nervousness was due \par
to his excitement, but he was also feeling a little guilty.  Amanda had been the \par
major sponsor of the original Santa Rosa expedition and Nick had spent \par
considerable time with her after they had found the treasure.  Amanda and Nick \par
and Jake Lewis had all three believed that Homer Ashford and his menage a` trois \par
had somehow hidden part of the treasure and then cheated them out of their \par
proper shares.  Nick and Amanda worked together trying to find evidence that \par
Homer had stolen from them, but they were never able to prove anything \par
conclusively.\par
\tab During this period Amanda and Nick had become quite close.  They had seen \par
each other virtually every week and for a while he had thought of her as an aunt \par
or grandmother.  But after a year or so, Nick had stopped going by to visit her.  \par
He hadn't understood it at the time, but the real reason he began to avoid her \par
was that Amanda was too intense for him.  And she was always too personal.  She \par
asked him too many hard questions about what he was doing with his life.\par
\tab On this particular morning he had no real options.  Amanda was widely \par
recognized as the expert on sunken treasure in the Keys.  There were two \par
components in her life, treasure and the theater, and her knowledge of each was \par
encyclopedic.  Nick had not called first because he didn't want to discuss the \par
trident unless she was willing to see him.  So it was with some trepidation that \par
he rang the doorbell on the front porch of her magnificent home.\par
\tab A young woman in her early twenties came to the door and opened it just a \par
bit.  "Yes?" she said, her face wedging into the crack, her expression wary.\par
\tab "My name's Nick Williams," he said.  "I would like to see Mrs. Winchester \par
if possible.  Is she in?"  There was a pause.  "I'm an old \emdash  "\par
\tab "My grandmother is very busy this morning," the girl curtly interrupted \par
him.  "Perhaps you can call and make an appointment." She started to close the \par
door and leave Nick standing on the porch next to his exercise bag.  Then Nick \par
heard another voice, a muffled exchange, and the door swung open.\par
\tab "Well, for goodness sake," Amanda said with her arms outstretched, "I have \par
a young gentleman caller.  Come here, Nikki, and give me a kiss."  Nick was \par
embarrassed.  He walked forward and gave the elderly woman a perfunctory hug.\par
\tab As he withdrew from the embrace, he started to apologize.  "I'm sorry I \par
haven't been by to see you.  I mean to, but somehow my schedule \emdash  "\par
\tab "It's all right, Nikki, I understand."  Amanda interrupted him pleasantly.  \par
Her eyes were so sharp they belied her age.  "Come in and tell me what you've \par
been up to.  I haven't seen you since, goodness, has it been a couple of years \par
already since we shared that cognac after Streetcar?"  She led him into a \par
combination study and living room and sat him down next to her on the couch.  \par
"You know, Nikki, I thought your comments about the actress playing Blanche \par
DuBois were the most observant ones I heard during the entire run.  You were \par
right about her.  She couldn't have played Blanche except as a total mental \par
case.  The woman simply had no concept of a feminine sexual appetite."\par
\tab Nick looked around him.  The room had hardly changed in the eight years \par
since he had last visited it.  The ceiling was very high, maybe fifteen feet.  \par
The walls were lined with bookcases whose full shelves extended all the way to \par
the ceiling.  Opposite the door a huge canvas painting of Amanda and her husband \par
standing outside their home on Cape Cod dominated the room.  A new 1955 Ford was \par
partially visible in the background of the painting.  She was radiantly \par
beautiful in the picture, in her early thirties, dressed in a white evening gown \par
with daring red trim both around the wrists and along the collar of the neck.  \par
Her husband was in a black tux.  He was mostly bald, with short blond hair \par
graying at the temples.  His eyes were warm and kindly.\par
\tab Amanda asked Nick if he wanted tea and he nodded.  The granddaughter \par
Jennifer disappeared into the hallway.  Amanda turned and took Nick's hands in \par
hers.  "I am glad you came, Nikki, I have missed you.  From time to time I hear \par
a snippet here or there about you or your boat, but often second-hand \par
information is altogether wrong.  What have you been doing?  Still reading all \par
the time?  Do you have a girlfriend?"\par
\tab Nick laughed.  Amanda had not changed.  She had never been one for small \par
talk.  "No girlfriend," Nick said, "same problem as always.  The ones that are \par
intelligent turn out to be either arrogant or emotionally inept or both; the \par
ones that are sensitive and affectionate have never read a book.  "For some \par
reason Carol Dawson jumped into Nick's mind and he almost said, without \par
thinking, "except for, maybe," but he stopped himself.  "What I need," he said \par
instead, "is someone like you."\par
\tab "No, Nikki," Amanda replied, suddenly serious.  She folded her hands in \par
her lap and stared momentarily across the room.  "No," she repeated softly, her \par
voice then gathering intensity as she turned back to look at him, "even I am not \par
perfect enough for you.  I remember well all your fantasy visions of gracious \par
young goddesses.  Somehow you had mixed the best parts of all the women in your \par
favorite novels together with your teenage dreams.  It always seemed to me that \par
you had put women up on a pedestal; they had to be queens or princesses.  But in \par
the girls you actually dated, you looked for weaknesses, signs of ordinariness, \par
and indications of common behavior.  It was almost as if you were hoping to find \par
them imperfect, to detect chinks in their armor so that you could justify your \par
lack of interest."\par
\tab Jennifer arrived with the tea.  Nick was uncomfortable.  He had forgotten \par
what it was like to talk to Amanda.  Her emotional probing and her unsolicited \par
observations were both extremely disquieting to him this morning.  Nick had not \par
come to see her to dissect his attitude toward women.  He changed the subject\par
\tab "Speaking of treasure," he said, bending down to pick up his bag, "I found \par
something very interesting yesterday while I was out diving.  I thought maybe \par
you might have seen something like it before."  He pulled the trident out and \par
handed it to Amanda.  She almost dropped it because she was not prepared for its \par
weight.\par
\tab "Goodness," she said, her skinny arm trembling under the strain of holding \par
the golden trident out in front of her.  "What could it possibly be made from?  \par
It's too heavy to be gold!"\par
\tab Nick leaned forward and took the object.  He held it for her as she ran \par
her fingers over its exceptionally smooth exterior.  "I've never seen anything \par
like this, Nikki.  I don't need to get out all the books and the photographs for \par
comparison.  The smoothness of the finish is inconsistent with the processing \par
techniques in Europe during or after the galleon days.  This must be modern.  \par
But I can't tell you anything else.  Where in the world did you find it?"\par
\tab He told her just the outline of the story, careful as always not to give \par
away key bits of information.  It was not just the agreement he had made with \par
Carol and Troy; treasure hunters never really trust anybody.  But he did share \par
with Amanda his idea that perhaps someone had cached this particular piece, as \par
well as some others, for later retrieval.  Nick insisted that this idea of his \par
was a perfectly plausible explanation for the tracks on the ocean floor.\par
\tab "Your scenario seems very unlikely to me," Amanda said, "although I must \par
admit that I am baffled and have no better explanation.  Maybe Miss Dawson has \par
some sources that can shed some light on the origin of this thing.  But there is \par
almost no chance that I am mistaken.  I have personally seen or viewed close-up \par
photographs of every significant piece of treasure recovered from the Keys in \par
the past century.  You could show me a new piece today and I could probably tell \par
you in what European country it was made and in what decade.  If this object \par
comes from a sunken ship, it is a modern ship, almost certainly after World War \par
II.  Beyond that I can't help you."\par
\tab Nick put the trident back in the bag and started to leave.  "Wait just a \par
minute before you go, Nikki," Amanda said as he stood up.  "Come over here for a \par
minute."  She took him by the arm and led him over to a spot just in front of \par
the large painting.  "You would have liked Walter, Nikki.  He was a dreamer \par
also.  He loved to look for treasure.  Every year we would spend a week or two \par
in the Caribbean on a yacht, ostensibly looking for treasure but just generally \par
sharing each other's dreams.  From time to time we would find objects on the \par
bottom of the ocean that we couldn't understand and we would create fanciful \par
conjectures to explain them.  Almost always there was some prosaic explanation \par
that was inferior to our fantasies."\par
\tab Nick was standing beside her with his bag in his right hand.  Amanda \par
turned to him and put her hand softly on his left forearm.  "But it didn't \par
matter.  It didn't even matter that most of the years we came up empty-handed \par
altogether.  For we always found the real treasure, our love for each other.  We \par
always returned home renewed and laughing and thankful that life had allowed us \par
to share another week or ten days in which we had imagined and fantasized and \par
hunted for treasure together."\par
\tab Her eyes were soft and loving.  Her voice was low but full of passion.  "I \par
do not know when or if you will come again, Nikki, but there are some things \par
that I have been wanting to say to you for some time.  If you like, you can \par
dismiss them as the ravings of a sententious old woman, but I may never have a \par
chance to tell you these things again.  You have all the attributes I loved in \par
Walter, intelligence, imagination, sensitivity.  But something is wrong.  You \par
are alone.  By choice.  Your dreams of treasure, your zest for life \emdash  you do not \par
share these things.  It is very sad for me to see this."  She stopped for a \par
second and looked back at the painting.  Then she completed her thought, almost \par
as if she were talking to herself.  "For when you are seventy years old and look \par
back at what your life has meant, you will not focus on your solo activities.  \par
What you will remember are the incidents of touching, those times when your life \par
was enriched by a moment of sharing with a friend or loved one.  It is our \par
mutual awareness of this miracle called life that allows us to accept our \par
mortality."\par
\par
\tab Nick had not been prepared for an emotional encounter with Amanda.  He had \par
thought that he would stop by to see her for a few moments, ask her about the \par
trident, and then depart.  In retrospect he realized that he had treated Amanda \par
very callously over the years.  She had offered genuine friendship and he had \par
spurned it, taking her out of his life altogether when their interaction no \par
longer suited him.  He winced as he recognized how selfish he had been.\par
\tab As he walked slowly down the street, idly looking at the gracious old \par
houses built over a hundred years ago, Nick took a deep breath.  He had \par
experienced too many emotions for one morning.  First Monique, then Amanda.  And \par
it looks as if the trident is not going to solve all my problems.  Funny how \par
things always come in groups.\par
\tab He found himself musing that maybe there had been a lot of truth in what \par
Amanda had said.  He acknowledged that he had been feeling lonely lately.  And \par
he wondered if the vague loneliness was indeed coupled to a creeping awareness \par
of his own mortality, to the passage of that phase of life enshrined by Thomas \par
Wolfe with the phrase, "For we were young, and we knew that we could never die."  \par
Nick was feeling very tired when he came to the end of the sidewalk and turned \par
onto the pavement of the convenience store parking lot.\par
\tab He saw her before she saw him.  She was standing next to the driver's side \par
of her brand-new red Mercedes sports coupe.  She had a small brown paper hag in \par
her arm and was looking in the window of the car next to hers, Nick's 1990 \par
Pontiac Nick felt a quick rush of adrenaline followed by anger and distrust.  \par
She finally saw him just as he started to speak.  "Why, Greta, what a surprise!  \par
I guess we just happened to be in this part of Key West today at exactly the \par
same time."\par
\tab "Ya, Nick, I thought it was your car.  How are you?"  Greta put the paper \par
bag on the hood of her car and approached him in a friendly manner.  She had \par
either missed or was ignoring the sarcasm in his greeting.  She was wearing a \par
sleeveless yellow tank top and a pair of tight blue shorts.  Her blonde hair was \par
pulled back in two short pigtails.\par
\tab "Don't play innocent with me, fraulein," Nick overreacted.  "I know you \par
didn't come here to shop.  " He was nearly shouting.  He used his free arm to \par
accentuate his comments and block Greta's approach.  "This is not one of the \par
stops on your circuit.  You came here to find me.  Now what do you want?"  Nick \par
dropped his arm.  A couple of passersby had stopped to watch the exchange.\par
\tab Greta stared at him for a moment with those crystal-clear eyes.  She was \par
wearing no makeup.  She looked like a little girl except for the wrinkles on her \par
face.  "Are you still so angry, Nick?  After all these years?"  She came up next \par
to him and smiled knowingly into his eyes.  "I remember one night, almost five \par
years ago," she said playfully, "when you were not so angry.  You were glad to \par
see me.  You asked me if I would have you for one night, no questions asked, and \par
I agreed.  You were great."\par
\tab In a momentary flash Nick remembered the rainy night when he had stopped \par
Greta just as she was leaving the pier.  He recalled also how desperately he had \par
needed to touch someone, anyone, on that particular night.  "That was the day \par
after my father's funeral," he said roughly, "and didn't mean shit anyway."  He \par
looked away.  He did not want to return her piercing gaze.\par
\tab "That wasn't the impression I had," Greta continued in the same playful \par
but otherwise emotionless tone.  "I felt you inside me, I tasted your kisses.  \par
You can't tell me \emdash  "\par
\tab "Look," interrupted Nick, clearly irritated.  "What do you want?  I don't \par
want to stand here all morning arguing with you about some stupid night five \par
years ago.  Now I know that you're here for a reason.  What is it?"\par
\tab Greta backed off a step and her face hardened.  "You are a very difficult \par
man, Nick.  It could be such fun doing business together if you weren't such a, \par
how do you say, pain in the ass."  She stopped for a moment.  "I have come from \par
Homer.  He has a proposition for you.  He wants to see what you found yesterday \par
in the ocean and maybe discuss a partnership."\par
\tab Nick laughed triumphantly.  "So I was right all along.  You were sent to \par
find me.  And now that bastard wants to discuss a partnership.  Hah.  Not a \par
fucking chance.  You won't steal from me again.  Tell your employer or lover or \par
whatever he is to cram his proposition up his ass.  Now if you'll excuse me .  .  \par
."\par
\tab He started to walk around Greta and open his car door.  Her strong hand \par
grabbed his forearm.  "You're making a mistake, Nick."  Her eyes bored into his \par
again.  "A big mistake.  You can't afford to do it on your own.  What you found \par
is probably worthless.  If it is, let him spend the money."  Her chameleon eyes \par
shifted one more time.  "And it would be such fun to work together again."\par
\tab Nick climbed into his car and turned on the engine.  "No dice, Greta.  \par
You're wasting your time.  Now I've got to go."  He backed out of the parking \par
place and then drove into the narrow street.  The treasure was front and center \par
in his mind again.  He had been momentarily depressed by what Amanda had told \par
him about the trident, but the fact that Homer wanted to see it gave Nick a \par
feeling of power.  But, he asked himself, how does he know already?  Who talked?  \par
Or could someone have seen us?\par
\par

\par
WHEN Commander Winters returned to his office after a scheduled meeting with the \par
public relations department, his secretary, Dora, was conspicuously reading the \par
Key West newspaper.  "Ahem," she said, deliberately attracting his attention.  \par
"Is the Vernon Winters starring in The Night of the Iguana at the Key West \par
Playhouse tonight anyone I know?  Or are there two of them in this town?"\par
\tab He laughed.  He liked Dora.  She was almost sixty, black, a grandmother \par
more than a dozen times, and one of the few secretaries on the base who actually \par
had some pride in her work.  She treated everybody, including Commander Winters, \par
like one of her children.  "So why didn't you tell me?" she said with feigned \par
outrage.  "After all, what if I had missed it altogether?  I told you last year \par
to make certain that you always told us when you were performing."\par
\tab He took her hand and gave it a little squeeze.  "I had intended to tell \par
you, Dora, but somehow it just slipped my mind.  And you know that my thespian \par
activities are not exactly embraced by the Navy, so I don't ballyhoo them about \par
so much.  But I'll have some tickets for you and your husband in a couple of \par
weeks."  He looked at the stack of message notes on her desk.  "That many, huh?  \par
And I was only gone a little over two hours.  It never rains but it pours."\par
\tab "Two of these are supposedly urgent."  Dora looked at her watch "A Miss \par
Dawson from the Miami Herald will call back in about five minutes and that \par
Lieutenant Todd has been calling all morning.  He insists that he must see you \par
before lunch or he can't be properly prepared for the meeting this afternoon.  \par
Apparently he left a long, message on your Top Secret telemail sometime this \par
morning.  Right now he's furious with me because I wouldn't interrupt your \par
meetings to tell you about his message.  Is it really that important?"\par
\tab Commander Winters shrugged his shoulders and opened the door to his \par
office.  I wonder what Todd wants, he thought.  I guess I should have checked my \par
telemail before running off to the meeting with the chief.  "Did you put all the \par
rest of the messages on the computer?" he asked Dora before he closed the door.  \par
She nodded.  "Okay, I'll talk to Miss Dawson when she calls.  Tell Todd that I \par
will see him in fifteen minutes." He sat down at his desk and turned on his \par
computer.  He activated his telemail subdirectory and saw that he had three new \par
entries already this morning, one in the TOP SECRET queue.  Commander Winters \par
identified himself, entered the top secret code word, and started to read \par
Lieutenant Todd's transmission.\par
\tab The phone rang.  After a few seconds Dora buzzed him and told him that it \par
was Miss Dawson.  Before they started, Commander Winters agreed that the \par
interview could be on the videophone and that it could be taped.  He recognized \par
Carol immediately from her occasional appearances on television.  She explained \par
to him that she was using the communications facility at the Miami International \par
Airport.\par
\tab "Commander Winters," she said, wasting no time, "we have an uncorroborated \par
report that the Navy is engaged in a search for something important, and secret, \par
in the Gulf of Mexico between Key West and the Everglades.  Your press people \par
and a Lieutenant Todd have both denied the report and referred all questions to \par
you.  Our source also told us, and we have subsequently verified both of these \par
facts, that there are today a large number of technology ships sailing in the \par
Gulf and that you have been trying to rent sophisticated ocean telescopes from \par
the Miami Oceanographic Institute.  Do you have any comment?"\par
\tab "Certainly, Miss Dawson." The commander wore his best acting smile.  He \par
had carefully rehearsed the response in his morning meeting with the admiral.  \par
"It's really amazing how rumors fly, particularly when someone suspects the Navy \par
of nefarious deeds.  " He chuckled.  "All the activity is just preparation for \par
some routine maneuvers next week.  A few of the sailors who man the technology \par
ships are a little rusty and wanted some practice this week.  As for the MOI \par
telescopes, we intended to use them in our maneuvers to check their value in \par
assessing underwater threats."  He looked directly at the camera.  "That's it, \par
Miss Dawson.  There's nothing special going on."\par
\tab Carol watched the commander on the monitor at the airport.  She had \par
expected someone with an imposing air of authority.  This man had a softness in \par
his eyes, some kind of sensitivity that was unusual in a career military \par
officer.  Carol had a sudden idea.  She walked up close to her own camera.  \par
"Commander Winters," she said pleasantly, "let me ask you a hypothetical \par
question.  If the Navy were testing a new kind of missile and one test flight \par
went astray, possibly even threatening population centers, wouldn't it be likely \par
that the Navy, claiming national security reasons as its defense, would deny \par
that such a thing had happened?"\par
\tab For a fleeting fraction of a second the expression in the eyes of \par
Commander Winters wavered.  He looked shocked.  Then he regained control.  "It \par
is difficult to answer such a hypothetical question," he intoned formally, "but \par
I can tell you that it is Navy policy to keep the public informed about its \par
activities.  Only when the flow of information to the public could significantly \par
undermine our national security would any kind of censorship take place."\par
\tab The interview wound up quickly.  Carol had accomplished her objective.  \par
Damn, said Commander Winters to himself as Dora announced that Lieutenant Todd \par
was waiting to see him.  I should have expected that question.  But how did she \par
know that?  Did she somehow trick Todd or one of the other officers?  Or did \par
someone in Washington spill the beans?\par
\tab Winters opened the door to his office and Lieutenant Todd nearly stormed \par
into the room.  With him was another tall young lieutenant, thick shouldered \par
with a bushy mustache whom Todd introduced as Lieutenant Ramirez of the Naval \par
Intelligence Division.  "Did you read my telemail message?  What did you think?  \par
My God, it's almost unbelievable what those Russians have done.  I had no idea \par
they could be so clever."  Todd was almost shouting as he paced excitedly around \par
the office.\par
\tab Winters watched Todd jumping around the room.  This young lieutenant, he \par
thought, is in a big hurry to get somewhere.  His impatience is oozing out of \par
every pore.  But what in the world is he saying about the Russians?  And why is \par
this Mexican muscleman here with him?\par
\tab "Sit down.  please," the commander replied, motioning at the two chairs \par
opposite his desk.  He looked sternly at Lieutenant Todd.  "And start by \par
explaining why Lieutenant Ramirez is here.  You know the regulations; we were \par
all briefed on them again last week.  Only officers at the rank of commander or \par
higher can authorize sharing information on a need-to-know basis."\par
\tab Todd immediately defended himself against the reproach.  "Commander \par
Winters, sir," he replied, "I believe that what we have here is a major \par
international incident, far too big to be handled by special projects and \par
systems engineering alone.  I left word on your telemail interrupt at 0830 this \par
morning for you to contact me ASAP, that there was a significant new development \par
in the Broken Arrow project.  When I had not heard from you by 1000, even though \par
I had tried several additional times to reach you by telephone, I became worried \par
that we might be losing valuable time.  I then contacted Ramirez so that he and \par
his men could start their work."\par
\tab Todd stood up from his chair.  "Sir," he began again, the excitement \par
rising in his voice, "maybe I didn't make it clear enough in my telemail \par
message.  We have hard evidence that someone commanded the Panther to go astray, \par
right after the APRS was activated.  We have confirmed from a special manual \par
search of the intermittent telemetry data that the command receipt counters went \par
crazy during a two-second period just before the missile veered off course."\par
\tab "Calm down, Lieutenant Todd, and sit down again.  "Winters was irritated, \par
not just by Todd's nonchalant dismissal of the regulations issue, but also by \par
his undisguised accusation that Winters had been delinquent in responding to his \par
messages.  The commander's day had begun with a meeting with the admiral who ran \par
the air station.  He had wanted a briefing on all this Broken Arrow business.  \par
So Winters had not even been in his office, except for a couple of minutes, \par
until after he came back from the public relations department.\par
\tab When Todd was again seated, Winters continued carefully, "Now spare me the \par
hysteria and your personal conclusions.  I want you to give me the facts, only \par
the facts, slowly and without prejudice.  The accusations you made a few moments \par
ago are very very serious.  In my eyes, if you have jumped to unsubstantiated \par
conclusions too quickly, your fitness as an officer may be in doubt.  So start \par
at the beginning."\par
\tab There was a flash of anger in the lieutenant's eyes and then he opened his \par
notebook.  When he spoke, his voice was a monotone, carefully modulated to be \par
free of all emotion.  "At precisely 0345 this morning," he began, "I was \par
awakened by Ensign Andrews, who had been working most of the night on the \par
telemetry dumps that we recalled both from the Canaveral station and the \par
tracking ship near Bimini.  His assignment had been to go through the scheduled \par
sequence of events onboard the Panther missile and determine, from the scattered \par
telemetry if possible, if any anomalous events had occurred onboard just before \par
the missile went off course.  We thought that this way we might have a chance to \par
isolate the cause of the problem.\par
\tab "Basically Ensign Andrews was a detective As you know, the data system is \par
quite constrained by the limited downlink bandwidth.  So the packets of \par
telemetry data come out in a somewhat artificial way, meaning that many of the \par
data values governing the behavior of the bird at the time it changed direction \par
would not have been sent to the Earth until several minutes later, after the \par
missile had gone awry and the tracking stations had already dropped and regained \par
lock a couple of times.\par
\tab "Ensign Andrews showed me that in the intermittent data there were four \par
discrete measurements taken from the command receipt counter, a simple buffer in \par
the software that increments by one every time a new command message is \par
correctly received by the missile.  At first we did not believe what we were \par
seeing.  We thought perhaps someone had made an error or that the decommutation \par
maps were wrong.  But by 0700 we had both checked the values from the two \par
tracking sites and verified that we were indeed looking at the correct channel.  \par
Commander, in the 1.7 seconds after the APRS was activated, the command receipt \par
counter registered over three hundred new messages.  And then the missile \par
swerved away from its intended target."\par
\tab The commander was writing in a small spiral notebook while Todd was \par
talking.  It took him almost half a minute to finish his notes.  Then he looked \par
up at Todd and Ramirez.  "Am I to believe then," he said, his voice heavy with \par
sarcasm, "that this is the entire data set upon which you wish to base your \par
indictment of the Soviet Union and put our Navy intelligence community on alert?  \par
Or is there something else?"\par
\tab Todd looked confused.  "You think it's more likely," Commander Winters \par
continued, his voice now rising, "that the Russians knew the code for the \par
command test set and transmitted three hundred messages in less than two \par
seconds, exactly at the right time and from somewhere off the Florida coast, \par
than it is that somewhere in the 4.2 software system there is an error that is \par
improperly incrementing the command receipt counter?  My God, Lieutenant, use \par
your head.  Are you seeing bogeymen at night?  This is 1994.  There is virtually \par
no tension on the international scene.  You believe that the Russians are so \par
colossally stupid that they would risk detente to command a Navy cruise missile \par
off course while it is still under test?  Even if they could somehow command the \par
missile to a specific location and then recover it and understand it thoroughly \par
by reverse engineering, why would they take such a horrendous chance for such a \par
comparatively small return?"\par
\tab Todd and Ramirez said nothing during the commander's harangue.  Ramirez \par
was starting to look uncomfortably embarrassed toward the end.  Todd's boyish \par
self-confidence had faded as well and he began to wring his hands and pop his \par
knuckles absentmindedly.  After a long pause Winters continued, firmly but \par
without some of the exasperation of his initial speech.\par
\tab "We assigned some specific work items yesterday, Lieutenant.  They were \par
supposed to be addressed by today.  Look again at the 4.2 software, particularly \par
to see if there were any errors in the interface with the command test set that \par
showed up during module or integration testing.  Maybe there was a bug in the \par
command receipt counter subroutine that did not get corrected in the new \par
release.  And for the meeting this afternoon, I want you to show me a list of \par
possible failure modes that would explain the telemetry data, other than \par
commands being sent from a foreign power.  And then show what you are planning \par
to do to analyze each failure mode and reduce the length of the list."\par
\tab Ramirez stood up to leave.  "Under the circumstances, Commander, I feel \par
that my presence here is a little, uh, improper.  I have briefed a couple of my \par
men already and have kicked off some investigative work to see if there is now \par
or has been recently any Russian military or civilian activity in the area.  I \par
had put a top priority on the effort.  In view of this conversation, I feel I \par
should suspend \emdash  "\par
\tab "Not necessarily," Commander Winters interrupted him.  "It might be very \par
difficult for you to explain at this juncture."  He looked at both of the \par
squirming young lieutenants.  "And it is not my wish to be vindictive and put \par
you both on report, although I think you both acted hastily and outside \par
regulations.  No, Lieutenant, continue with the intelligence gathering, it may \par
eventually be of some importance.  Just don't make a big deal out of it.  I'll \par
accept the responsibility."\par
\tab Ramirez walked toward the door.  He was clearly grateful.  "Thank you, \par
Commander," he said sincerely, "for a minute there I thought maybe I had crapped \par
in my mess kit.  I've learned a very valuable lesson."\par
\tab Winters saluted the intelligence officer and motioned Todd, who was \par
apparently also preparing to leave, back to his seat.  The commander walked over \par
in front of the Renoir painting and appeared to be studying it.  He spoke \par
quietly, without turning to face the junior lieutenant.  "Did you say anything \par
to that reporter Miss Dawson about a missile, or did she mention a missile to \par
you while you were talking to her?"\par
\tab "No, sir, there was nothing like that," Todd asserted.  "She was even \par
vague when I asked her what she had heard."\par
\tab "She either has some inside information or is very very lucky," the \par
commander said abstractedly, almost to himself.  He walked over closer to the \par
painting and imagined that he could hear the piano being played by the younger \par
of the two sisters.  Today he heard a Mozart sonata.  But it was not the right \par
time to listen.  This young man needs a good lesson out of all this, Winters \par
thought as he turned around.\par
\tab "Do you smoke.  Lieutenant?" he asked, offering Todd a cigarette and \par
placing one in his own mouth.  The younger man shook his head.  "I do," said \par
Winters, lighting his Pall Mall, "even though there are a thousand reasons why I \par
shouldn't.  But I almost never smoke around people who don't.  It's a question \par
of consideration."\par
\tab Winters walked over to look out the window and blew the smoke slowly out \par
his mouth.  Todd looked puzzled.  "And right now," Winters continued, "I'm \par
smoking, strangely enough, also out of consideration.  For you.  You see, \par
Lieutenant Todd," he said, wheeling around dramatically, "I'm calmer after I \par
smoke.  That means I can deal better with my anger."\par
\tab He walked directly over in front of the lieutenant.  "Because I'm goddamn \par
mad about this, young man.  Make no mistake about that.  There's a part of me \par
that wants to make an example of you, maybe even court martial you for not \par
following regulations.  You're too cocky, too sure of your own conclusions.  \par
You're dangerous.  If you had slipped and made some of the comments you made in \par
here to that woman reporter, then it would be Katie bar the door.  But" \emdash  \par
Winters walked around behind his desk and stubbed out his cigarette, \emdash  "it has \par
always been my belief that people should not be crucified for a single mistake."\par
\tab The commander sat down and leaned back in his chair.  "Just between us \par
guys, Lieutenant, you're on probation with me.  I don't want to hear any more \par
nonsense about an international incident.  This is a simple case of a \par
malfunctioning test missile.  Do your job thoroughly and carefully.  Don't \par
worry, you'll be noticed if the work is done properly.  The system is not blind \par
to your ambition or your talent.  But if you run off half-cocked one more time \par
on this problem, I will personally see to it that your personnel file is \par
ruined."\par
\tab Todd could tell that he was being dismissed.  He was still angry, now at \par
himself mostly, but he knew better than to let any of it show.  He considered \par
Commander Winters to be a marginally competent old fart, and he hated being \par
lectured by him.  As of now, however, I have no choice but to accept it, he said \par
to himself as he left the commander's office.\par

NICK'S message light was blinking when he walked into his townhouse after the \par
meeting with Amanda and the encounter with Greta.  He put the bag with the \par
trident back in the closet and turned on the answering machine.  Julianne \par
appeared on the small three-inch monitor.  Nick smiled to himself.  She always \par
left all of his messages, no matter how small, in video.\par
\tab "Sorry to tell you this, Nick, but your Tampa charter for tomorrow and \par
Sunday just called up to cancel.  They said they heard a weather forecast \par
calling for thunderstorms.  Anyway, all is not completely lost 'cause you get to \par
keep their deposit."  She paused a couple of seconds.  "By the way, Linda and \par
Cotinne and I are going to Sloppy Joe's tonight to hear Angie Leatherwood.  Why \par
don't you stop by and say hello?  I might even buy you a drink."\par
\tab Shit, said Nick to himself.  I needed the money.  And Troy did too.  He \par
automatically entered Troy's name on the small keyboard near the phone and \par
waited for Troy to pick up the receiver and turn on the video switch.\par
\tab "Why hello, Professor.  What are you doing on such a beautiful day in the \par
tropics?"  Troy was in a good humor as usual.  Nick could not understand how \par
anyone could be in such a perpetually good mood.\par
\tab "I have bad news and bad news, my friend," Nick replied.  "First, Amanda \par
Winchester says our trident is modern and almost certainly not a part of any \par
ancient treasure.  For my part, I'm not completely convinced.  But it doesn't \par
look promising.  Second, and probably more important for the short term, our \par
charter has cancelled.  We have no work for the weekend."\par
\tab "Ouch," Troy said, a frown sweeping over his face.  "That do present some \par
problems."  For a moment it seemed that Troy couldn't figure out what to say.  \par
Then the normal Troy was back, smiling cheerfully, "Hey, Professor, I have an \par
idea.  Since we now both have nothing to do this afternoon, why don't you come \par
over here to the Jefferson sanitarium for some chips and beer?  I want to show \par
you something anyway."  His eyes were twinkling.\par
\tab Under almost any circumstances Nick would have declined Troy's offer and \par
spent the afternoon reading Madame Bovary.  But the morning had already been \par
heavy with emotion and Nick was acutely aware that he needed some levity.  He \par
smiled to himself.  Troy was a very funny man.  An afternoon of booze and mirth \par
sounded appealing.  Besides, Troy had been working for him for four months and \par
they had not yet taken any time to socialize.  Even though they had spent many \par
hours working together on the boat, Nick had never once visited Troy's \par
apartment.  "All right," Nick heard himself respond, "you're on.  I'll bring the \par
food and you get the beer.  I'll see you in twenty to thirty minutes."\par
\tab When Nick stopped his car in front of the small frame duplex in one of Key \par
West's oldest sections, Troy was just arriving himself.  He had apparently \par
walked to a nearby store, for he was carrying a large brown paper bag containing \par
three six-packs of beer.  "This ought to hold us for the afternoon."  He winked \par
as he greeted Nick and led him up the walkway to his front door.  A paper sign \par
was taped to the door.  It said, PROF \emdash  BE BACK IN A JIFF \emdash  TROY.  Troy took the \par
sign down and reached up to a small ledge above the door to find a key.\par
\tab Nick had never wondered what Troy's apartment would be like.  But he \par
certainly would not have imagined the living room that he found when he followed \par
Troy inside.  The room was laid out neatly and furnished in what could only be \par
called early grandmother style.  The motley array of old couches and easy chairs \par
purchased at neighborhood garage sales (none of which was the same color, which \par
was of no importance to Troy \emdash  he thought of furniture in terms of functional \par
units, not as pieces of decoration) were arranged in a rectangle with a long \par
wooden coffee table in the middle.  An assortment of electronics and video \par
magazines were neatly stacked upon the table.  Dominating the room was a state-\par
of-the-art sound system whose four tall speakers were carefully placed in the \par
corners so that all the sound was focused toward the center of the room.  As \par
soon as the two men were inside, Troy went over to the compact disc player on \par
thc top of the stereo equipment rack and turned it on.  A wonderfully rich, \par
black, female voice backed by a piano and a guitar filled the room.\par
\tab "This is Angie's new album," Troy said, handing Nick an open beer.  He had \par
been to the kitchen and the refrigerator while Nick was looking around the room.  \par
"Her agent thinks this one will go gold.  Love Letters just barely missed, but \par
she made more than a quarter of a million off it anyway.  Not counting the money \par
from the concert tour."\par
\tab "I remember your telling me that you knew her." Nick said, taking a long \par
drink from his beer.  He had walked across the room to a box next to the stereo \par
rack where sixty or seventy discs were neatly arranged.  On the front of an open \par
disc jacket on the top of the box was a beautiful young black woman, softly \par
backlit.  She was wearing a long dark cocktail dress.  Memories of Enchanting \par
Nights was the title of the album.  "Is there more to the story of Miss \par
Leatherwood?"  Nick said, looking up at Troy.  "This is one magnificent lady, if \par
you ask me."\par
\tab Troy came over beside him.  He programmed the disc player to cut eight on \par
the album.  "Thought you'd never ask," he grinned expansively.  "This song \par
probably says it the best."  Nick sat down in one of the strange easy chairs and \par
listened to a soft ballad with an easy beat in the background.  The title of the \par
song was "Let Me Take Care of You, Baby."  It told the story of a gifted lover \par
who made the songstress laugh at home or in bed.  They were compatible, they \par
were friends.  But he couldn't talk commitment because he hadn't made it yet.  \par
So in the last stanza the woman singing the song appeals to him to swallow his \par
pride and let her make it easy for him.\par
\tab Nick looked at Troy and rolled his eyes while he shook his head.  \par
"Jefferson," he said, "you're too much.  I never know when you're telling the \par
truth and when you're slinging bullshit with both arms."\par
\tab Troy laughed and stood up from the couch.  "But, Professor," he protested, \par
"that's what makes it more interesting."  He came over and took Nick's empty \par
beer can.  "It's hard for you to believe, isn't it?" he said, still smiling \par
while he looked directly at Nick, "that maybe your funny black first mate has a \par
few dimensions you haven't seen."\par
\tab Troy turned and walked toward the kitchen.  Nick could hear him opening \par
beer cans and putting the chips in a bowl.  "So," Nick hollered, "I'm waiting.  \par
What's the scoop?"\par
\tab "Angie and I have known each other for five years," Troy said from the \par
kitchen.  "When we were first dating she was only nineteen and completely naive \par
about life.  One night we were over here, right after I first moved in, and we \par
were listening to a Whitney Houston album.  Angie started singing."\par
\tab Troy came back in the living room.  He put the bowl of assorted chips on \par
the little wood coffee table and sat down in a chair next to Nick.  "The rest, \par
as they say in Hollywood, is history."  He waved his arms.  "I introduced her to \par
the owner of a local night club.  Within a year she had a recording contract and \par
I had a problem.  She was my woman.  But I couldn't afford to keep up with her."  \par
Troy was uncharacteristically quiet for a few seconds.  "It's really shit when \par
your pride stands in the way of your feelings for the only woman you've ever \par
loved."\par
\tab Nick was surprised to discover that Troy's intimate revelation had touched \par
him.  Nick leaned forward in his chair and dropped his hand lightly on Troy's \par
shoulder in a gesture of understanding.  Troy changed the subject quickly.  "And \par
what about you, Professor?  How many broken hearts are hanging in your closet?  \par
I've seen the way Julianne and Corinne and even Greta look at you.  Why haven't \par
you ever married?"\par
\tab Nick laughed and guzzled his beer.  "Christ, this must be my lucky day.  \par
Do you know, Jefferson, that you're the second person today to ask me about my \par
love life?  And the first one was a seventy-year-old woman."\par
\tab Nick took another drink.  "Speaking of Greta," he continued, "I ran into \par
her this morning \emdash  and it wasn't an accident.  She was waiting for me while I \par
was talking to Amanda.  She knew that we found something yesterday and wanted to \par
talk about a partnership deal.  Do you know anything about this?"\par
\tab "Sure do," Troy answered easily.  "Homer must have had her spying on us.  \par
When I finished up with the boat last night, she was waiting to pump me for \par
information.  She had watched you leave with your exercise bag and either \par
guessed or knew that we had found something.  I didn't tell her anything, \par
although I didn't deny it either.  Remember, Ellen saw Carol and me in the \par
marina office with all that snazzy equipment."\par
\tab "Yeah, I know," said Nick, "and I really didn't expect to keep it entirely \par
under wraps forever.  I just wish we could find more of the treasure, if it \par
exists, before those snoops start to follow our every move."\par
\tab The two men sat in silence, drinking their beer.  "But you've managed to \par
avoid my question," Troy said at length with a mischievous smile.  "The subject \par
was women.  How come a guy like you, handsome, educated, apparently not gay, \par
does not have a steady woman?"\par
\tab Nick thought for a moment.  He studied Troy's friendly, guileless face and \par
decided to take the plunge.  "I'm not sure, Troy," he said seriously, "but I \par
think maybe I push them all away.  I find something wrong with them so I have an \par
excuse."  A new idea crept into Nick's mind.  "Maybe I'm getting even in a way.  \par
You asked about broken hearts?  The biggest one in the closet is my own.  Mine \par
was torn to shreds when I was a kid by a woman who probably doesn't even \par
remember me."\par
\tab Troy rose from his chair and walked over to the disc player to change the \par
music.  "Listen to us," he said lightly, "both struggling with the infinite \par
complexity of the female species.  May they remain forever crazy and mysterious \par
and wonderful.  And by the way, Professor" \emdash  Troy's characteristic grin had \par
returned, \emdash  "I brought this subject up to warn you.  Unless I miss my guess, \par
that reporter lady has her sights set on you.  She likes challenges.  And so far \par
you have given off nothing but negative signals.  To say the least."\par
\tab Nick jumped up from his chair with a spurt of energy.  "I'm going for \par
another beer, my good man.  Until just this moment I had thought that I was \par
talking to someone with insight and understanding.  Now I find that I'm talking \par
instead to some stupid black man who thinks 'asshole' is a term of endearment."  \par
He paused briefly on his way to the kitchen to pick up some potato chips.  "By \par
the way," he shouted at Troy between crunches on his chips, "you said on the \par
phone that you wanted to show me something.  Was that the Angie Leatherwood \par
album or was it something else?"\par
\tab Troy met him in the hall as Nick was returning with the beer.  "No," he \par
said earnestly, "it was something else.  But I wanted to talk to you for a \par
little first to make sure .  .  .  well, I'm not sure why, maybe to give me some \par
confidence that you wouldn't put me down."\par
\tab "What are you talking about?"  Nick said, a little confused.\par
\tab "It's in here," Troy replied, knocking on a closed door off the hall in \par
the opposite direction from the living room.  "It's my baby.  I've been working \par
on it for over two years now, alone most of the time \emdash  although Angie's artistic \par
kid brother Lanny has helped me with some of it \emdash  and now I want you to try it \par
out." He smiled.  "You will be my first alpha tester."\par
\tab "What the hell .  .  .  I'm lost.  What's an alpha tester?"  Nick's brow \par
furrowed as he tried to follow the conversation.  The two quick beers on an \par
empty stomach had already given him a small and unexpected buzz.\par
\tab "My invention," Troy said slowly, letting each word sink in, "is a \par
computer game.  I've been working on it for almost two years.  And you are going \par
to be the first outsider to play it."\par
\tab Nick screwed up his face as if he had just eaten a particularly tart piece \par
of grapefruit.  "Moi?" he exclaimed.  "You want me to play a computer game?  You \par
want me, whose hand-eye coordination is almost nonexistent even when completely \par
sober, to sit down and shoot aliens, or dodge bombs, or roll marbles at a \par
frenzied pace that only neo-adolescents can enjoy?  Jefferson, have you lost \par
your mind?  This is Nick Williams, the guy you call the Professor, the man who \par
sits and reads books for entertainment."\par
\tab "Very, very good," Troy replied, laughing heartily at Nick's outburst.  \par
"You're perfect as an alpha tester.  My game is not one of those arcade games \par
that test your reflexes, although there are a few places in the game where the \par
pace is fairly fast.  My creation is an adventure game.  It's a little like a \par
novel, except that the player defines the outcome of the game.  I'm aiming at a \par
wide audience and I'm including a lot of unusual technological wrinkles.  I \par
would love to see how you respond."\par
\tab Troy took Nick's shrug as grudging assent and opened the door to what \par
should have been the master bedroom in the duplex unit.  Instead, what greeted \par
Nick's eyes was an almost phantasmagoric collection of electronic equipment \par
filling every nook and cranny of a fairly large room.  His first impression was \par
one of total chaos.  But after shaking his head and blinking a couple of times, \par
Nick could make out some order in the jumble of scopes, monitors, cables, \par
computers, and sundry unattached parts.  On one side of the room was a chair \par
about ten feet in front of a giant screen.  Between this chair and the screen \par
was a low table with a keyboard on it.  Troy motioned to Nick to sit down.\par
\tab "My game is called Alien Adventure," Troy said excitedly, "and it will \par
start as soon as I boot the discs and you are ready at the keyboard.  But there \par
are some things that I must tell you first, before you start." He knelt beside \par
Nick and pointed at the keyboard.  "There are three critical keys for you to \par
remember while you are playing the game.  First, the X key stops the clock.  \par
From the moment you start the game, the clock continues to run.  While the clock \par
is running you are consuming vital resources.  There is only this one way to \par
stop the clock and gather your wits without paying a penalty.  Hitting the X key \par
allows you to stop and think.\par
\tab "Even more important than the X is the S key.  The S allows you to \par
checkpoint or, as you would say, save the game.  Right now you can't understand \par
what I'm telling you, because you haven't played complicated computer games \par
before, but believe me, you must learn regularly to save the game.  When you hit \par
the S key, all the parameters of the game you are playing are written into a \par
special data base that has a unique identifier.  Then, at any time in the \par
future, you can call that identifier and the game will restart in exactly the \par
place where you saved it.  This feature can be a life saver.  If you take a \par
risky route in the game and your character ends up dying, it's the save game \par
feature that keeps you from having to start all over again."\par
\tab Nick was amazed.  This was a different Troy than he had ever seen before.  \par
True, he had been a little surprised and considerably impressed by his first \par
mate's ability to fix virtually any piece of electronic gear on the boat, but \par
never in his wildest dreams had he imagined that Troy left the boat and went \par
home to work with similar parts in a much more creative way.  Now this same \par
smiling black man had him sitting in a chair in front of a giant screen and was \par
lecturing him patiently like a child.  Nick could hardly wait to see what would \par
happen next.\par
\tab "Finally," Troy said, asking with his eyes if Nick was still following \par
him, "there's the H or help key.  When you simply have run out of imagination \par
and don't know what to do, you can push H.  The game will then give you some \par
hints on how you might proceed.  But I must warn you of one thing.  The clock \par
continues to run while you are being helped.  And there are some places in the \par
game, during a battle for instance where pushing the H key can be disastrous, \par
because you are essentially defenseless during the time that the game processes \par
your request for help.  H is most useful when you are in a benign spot and \par
trying to figure out your overall strategy."\par
\tab Still squatting beside him, Troy handed Nick a small spiral notebook and \par
motioned for him to open it.  The first page said "Command Dictionary." On each \par
page was a separate entry, legibly written by hand, that explained the game \par
command that would result from hitting the key listed at the top of the page.  \par
"Here are the rest of your commands, fifty in all," Troy said.  "But you don't \par
need to memorize them.  I'll help you.  You'll learn some of them yourself after \par
you play the game for a while.  Most of the important commands are activated by \par
a single stroke on the keyboard, but some of the commands require two entries."\par
\tab Nick flipped through the notebook.  He noted that the key L prompted the \par
command "Look."  But another entry was necessary to identify what instrument was \par
being used to look.  L followed by a 1, for example, meant to look with your \par
eyes.  L8 meant to look with an ultraviolet spectrometer, whatever that was.  \par
Nick was already overwhelmed.  He looked over at his friend, who was busy making \par
final checks on some equipment.\par
\tab Troy came back to the chair and looked down at Nick.  "Now," he said, "I \par
think you're ready Any questions?"\par
\tab "Just one, my lord and guide," Nick replied with mock meekness.  "May I \par
please have another beer before I risk my manhood in some weird world of your \par
creation?"\par
\par
\tab Actually Nick was not yet ready to play the game.  Even after Troy booted \par
three compact discs, there were more preliminary activities before Nick could \par
begin the game itself.  He had to enter his name, race, age, and sex in response \par
to questions that appeared on the giant screen.  Nick looked at Troy with a \par
curious tilt of his head and a weird expression on his face.  "Don't ask \par
questions at this point," Troy told him, "it will all be clear soon enough."\par
\tab The screen next was filled with a beautiful ringed planet that looked like \par
what an artist who favored purple might make out of Saturn.  The perspective was \par
from the pole of the planet; the rings were all displayed like the different \par
sections of a dart target.  Little flecks of light gleamed intermittently from \par
the rings, indicating that the sun or star or whatever was the source for the \par
reflected light was in the vicinity of the viewer.  It was a lovely picture.  A \par
simple credit in block titles, Alien Adventure by Troy Jefferson, was \par
superimposed on the ringed planet for three or four seconds and the sound of \par
soft classical music could be heard in the room.  Nick resisted an urge to \par
chuckle when he heard Troy's voice, clearly serious and selfconscious, coming \par
from one of the speakers.\par
\tab Troy's recorded voice explained the initial conditions for the game.  The \par
adventurer was on a space station in polar orbit around Gunna, the largest \par
planet belonging to another solar system whose central body was the G-type star \par
that we call Tau Ceti, only ten light years or so away from the Earth.  "Tau \par
Ceti has eight primary bodies in its system," Troy's voice said, "including six \par
planets and two moons.\par
\tab "Maps of the system are available at the commissary on the space station," \par
Troy's voice continued, "although some of the regions have been incompletely \par
mapped.  When your adventure begins, you are sleeping in your cabin onboard the \par
station.  An alarm sounds on your personal receiver .  .  ."\par
\tab The voice faded and the sound of an alarm could be heard.  The picture on \par
the giant screen was the inside of a space cabin, almost certainly taken from \par
one of the many successful science fiction movies.  In the upper right hand \par
corner of the screen was a game digital clock that was changing by one unit \par
every four seconds or so.  Nick looked helplessly at Troy.  Troy suggested that \par
he hit the L key.  In a few seconds Nick learned that he could use the direction \par
keys on the board to look at specific items in his cabin.  Each time he hit a \par
direction key, the picture on the screen changed to correspond to a different \par
point of view.  Nick noticed that there was a fuzzy picture on his small \par
television and followed Troy's suggestion to watch until it became clear.\par
\tab When the focus on his cabin television sharpened, Nick could see a young \par
woman wearing a long, full, richly red dress that dropped almost all the way to \par
the floor.  She was standing, somewhat incongruously, in a small, stark room \par
furnished with a single bed, a little desk, and a straight chair.  Some light \par
was entering the room through the solitary window near the ceiling and behind \par
the desk.  Thick vertical bars were imbedded in the window glass.\par
\tab The camera zoomed in on her face.  Nick leaned forward in his chair in \par
Troy's apartment.  "Why .  .  .  why it's Julianne," Nick said in astonishment, \par
just as the woman began to speak.\par
\tab "Captain Nick Williams," she said, much to his surprise, "you and I have \par
never met, but your reputation for valor and justice is unequaled in the \par
Federation.  I am Princess Heather of Othen.  While attending the great ball at \par
the inauguration of the Viceroy of Toom, I was kidnapped by willens and taken to \par
their stronghold on the planet Accutar.  They have told my father, King Merson, \par
that they will not release me unless he cedes to them all the ore-rich asteroids \par
in the Endelva region.\par
\tab "He must not do that, Nick," the princess continued earnestly as the \par
camera zoomed in on her face, "or he will deprive our people of their only \par
source of hanna, the key to our immortality.  My sources tell me that already my \par
father wastes away, brooding over his impossible predicament.  My sister \par
Samantha has fled from Othen with a key division of our best soldiers and a huge \par
store of hanna.  It is not clear whether she intends to try to free me or to \par
revolt against my father's rule in the event that he should decide to give up \par
the Endelva asteroids in exchange for my life.  She has always been completely \par
unpredictable.\par
\tab "Yesterday the willens delivered an ultimatum to my father.  He must make \par
his decision in one month, or they will behead me.  Captain Williams, please \par
help me.  I do not want to die.  If you come and rescue me, I will share with \par
you the Othen throne and the secret of our immortality.  We can live forever as \par
king and queen."\par
\tab The transmission stopped suddenly and the picture was gone.  The screen \par
again showed a picture of the inside of Nick's cabin onboard the space station.  \par
Nick resisted an impulse to applaud and sat without moving.  Somehow Troy had \par
made Julianne into a very believable Princess Heather.  But how did my name get \par
into the script?  he wondered.  He wanted to ask questions but a warning message \par
flashed on the giant screen, indicating that time was passing and the adventurer \par
was not taking any action.  Nick found the X key and the digital clock on the \par
screen stopped.  He turned to Troy.  "So what do I do now?"\par
\tab With Troy's occasional help, Nick equipped himself for a journey, found \par
his way to the spaceport, and climbed in a small shuttle craft.  Despite Troy's \par
hints that his chances for survival in "open space" were small unless he spent \par
more time examining the other facilities on the space station, Nick blasted off \par
anyway.  It was great fun.  He used the commands on the keyboard to control his \par
speed and direction.  What he saw on the screen was perfectly matched with his \par
commands, giving him the illusion that he was actually flying a vehicle through \par
space.  He saw many other vehicles on the monitor as he maneuvered toward his \par
target, a planet named Gunna, but none of them approached his shuttle.  Just \par
outside the Gunna sphere of influence, however, a needle-nosed craft approached \par
him quickly and then, without warning, blasted him with a battery of missiles.  \par
Nick was unable to escape.  The screen filled with fire from the explosion that \par
ripped through his shuttle.  Then the monitor went blank and black except for \par
the simple message "Game Over" in white letters in the middle of the screen.\par
\tab "Time for another beer?  Nick asked, surprised to discover that he was \par
actually disappointed by the death of his character.\par
\tab "Right on, Captain," Troy replied.\par
\tab They walked into the kitchen together.  Troy opened the refrigerator and \par
pulled out two more beers.  He handed one to Nick.  The professor was still \par
absorbed in thinking about the game.  "If I remember correctly, there were four \par
sections marked on that map of the space station," Nick said aloud.  "And I only \par
went in two of them.  Would you mind telling me about the other two sections?"\par
\tab "You missed the cafeteria and the library," Troy said delighted that Nick \par
was still interested.  "The cafeteria is not all that important," he added, \par
laughing, "although I've never known you to go anywhere before without eating \par
first.  But the library \emdash  "\par
\tab "Don't tell me," Nick said, interrupting him.  "Let me figure it out.  In \par
the library I can learn about willens and the Otheners, or whatever they're \par
called, who can live forever and what exactly is a Viceroy of Toom."  He shook \par
his head.  "My, my, Troy.  I must say that I am more than a little impressed.  I \par
have no idea how anyone could create something like this; And I have a feeling \par
that I've just scratched the surface."\par
\tab "I take it you're ready to continue, Professor?"  Troy replied, \par
acknowledging the praise with a huge grin.  "One piece of advice.  While you're \par
in the library, look in the Encyclopedia of Space Vehicles so you can at least \par
tell a hostile ship when it appears.  Otherwise you're never going to reach the \par
exciting parts of the game."\par
\par
\tab The afternoon passed quickly Nick found that escape into the imaginative \par
world of Troy's game was magnificently relaxing, just the tonic that he needed \par
after the morning memories of Monique.  Troy knew that Nick was enjoying the \par
playing and he was thrilled.  He felt a surge of creative pride and his belief \par
that Alien Adventure would be his ticket to success was reborn.\par
\tab In his vain search for Princess Heather, Nick died a couple more times.  \par
Once, when he landed on the unmapped planet Thenia, a black man with a lizard \par
head approached him and told him to leave, that there was nothing but trouble on \par
Thenia.  Nick ignored the warning and moved away from his shuttle in a land \par
rover.  He narrowly escaped a volcanic eruption only to be trapped and eaten by \par
a gigantic slime mold that oozed out of the ground in the vicinity of his \par
shuttle landing site.\par
\tab In another reincarnation Nick encountered Samantha, Princcss Heather's \par
sister, played for a couple of scenes by Julianne's buxom friend Corinne.  \par
Actually, Troy had made Corinne up to look like Susie Q, the famous porn queen \par
of the early nineties, and most of the actual pictures that appeared on the game \par
screen were taken from her ribald classic Pleasure Until Pain.  Deft \par
interleaving of new footage with the borrowed shots gave the illusion of being \par
in the movie with Susie Q while she offered sexual delights beyond refusal.\par
\tab Samantha alias Susie Q alias Corinne seduced Nick and then stabbed him to \par
death with a small dagger while he was lying naked and expectant on the bed.  By \par
this point the two men were drinking their final six-pack of beer and the \par
combination of the pornographic scenes and the alcohol had made their \par
conversation coarse and degenerate.  "Shit," exclaimed Nick, entreating Troy to \par
replay the scene where a naked Samantha/Susie Q comes up to the camera to take \par
his erect penis in her mouth.  "I have never, no never, even heard of a computer \par
game where you almost get a blow job.  Man, you are twisted.  A genius, yes, \par
I'll agree.  But absolutely fucking twisted.  What on God's earth induced you to \par
put sex scenes in this game?"\par
\tab "Hey, man."  Troy laughed, putting his arm around Nick as they half \par
staggered into the living room, "the name of the game is sales.  And right here, \par
in Entertainment Software (he picked up a magazine from the table), it says that \par
seventy-two percent, seventy-two fucking percent, my friend, of all the people \par
who buy computer games are 16- to 24-year-old males.  And do you know what that \par
group likes in addition o computer games and science fiction?  Sex, my man.  \par
Can't you just see some teenage nerd retreating into his room to play this game \par
and whack off?  Eeee yaaa!"  Troy fell down on one of the easy chairs and beat \par
his chest.\par
\tab "You're crazy, Jefferson," Nick said, watching Troy's display.  "I don't \par
know if I can ever again be alone with you on a boat.  You are a certified nut \par
case.  I mean, just imagine the reviews.  Alien Adventure features an encounter \par
with Susie Q the queen of pornography, in an underground castle on the asteroid \par
Vitt.  Which reminds me, how in the world did you get all those movie pieces in \par
there?"\par
\tab "Lots of research and hard work, Professor," Troy answered, starting to \par
calm down a little.  "Lanny and three of his friends have spent maybe a thousand \par
hours watching film for me, trying to find exactly the right clips.  And none of \par
this would be possible, of course, without the new data storage methods.  We can \par
now store an excellent digital version of every movie ever made in the United \par
States in a warehouse not much larger than this duplex.  I've just used data \par
base capabilities to the fullest."\par
\tab Nick crushed a beer can in his hands.  "It's fabulous.  Really.  But I \par
don't know about the sex business.  And why do you have the player register his \par
race at the beginning of the game?  Don't you think that will offend some \par
people?  I never saw anything in the game that was based on the racial \par
information."\par
\tab Even though he was drunk, Troy became momentarily serious and almost \par
somber.  "Look, man," he said firmly, "sex and race are both a part of life.  It \par
may be true that people play computer games primarily for entertainment, and \par
that they would prefer not to be confronted by some topics when they are amusing \par
themselves, but I must be allowed some creative license.  Race is with us every \par
day and ignoring it, it seems to me, only contributes to the problem."\par
\tab Troy brightened up.  "Hey, Professor.  That lizard-man who warned you on \par
Thenia was black.  You went ahead anyway despite his warning.  What if he had \par
been white?  Would you have turned around and gone back to the shuttle?  A black \par
man playing the game encounters a white lizard-man on Thenia.  It's part of the \par
show, man.  There are twenty or so changes in the scenario that are based on \par
racial input."\par
\tab Nick's expression was clearly disbelieving.  "Really," Troy said, standing \par
up to return to the room where they had played his game, "I'll show you.  Watch \par
how the game starts if you register that you are a black male."\par
\tab Nick followed Troy back into the computer room.  His curiosity was clearly \par
piqued.  Troy turned the game on and Nick entered the biographical data, \par
changing his race to black.  This time, when the television picture in his space \par
station cabin came into focus, Princess Heather was black!  The princess this \par
time was, in fact, Angie Leatherwood.  "Well, I'll be damned," Nick said, \par
looking over at a beaming Troy.  "You are one clever dude, Mr. Jefferson."  Nick \par
walked out of the room whistling and shaking his head again.  Troy turned off \par
the game and followed.\par
\tab "Okay," Nick began, once they were back in Troy's living room and seated \par
on the couch, "one last question and then let's forget the game for the time \par
being.  How did you get my name into it?  I thought that was very impressive."\par
\tab "It was originally Lanny's idea, based on a movie he watched about a \par
speech therapist.  Lanny had all the minor characters spend a day mouthing all \par
the vowel and consonant sounds in a test session.  Then we just put the sounds \par
together with what are called audio analytic continuation techniques."  Troy \par
laughed.  He was feeling ebullient and basking in the compliments.  "But it does \par
have its drawbacks.  Our interpreter only knows how to read simple English \par
words.  We may have to suppress that feature if we sell the game abroad."\par
\tab Nick stood up.  "Well, I've run out of superlatives By the way, are there \par
more of you, brothers, sisters, anything?  I guess I'd like to warn the rest of \par
the world."\par
\tab "Only me now," Troy replied.  a faraway look fleetingly crossing his face.  \par
"I had a brother, Jamie, six years older than me.  We were very close.  He died \par
in an automobile accident when I was fourteen."\par
\tab There was an awkward silence.  "I'm sorry," Nick said, again touched by \par
Troy's openness.  Troy shrugged his shoulders and struggled with the sudden \par
memory.\par
\tab Nick changed the subject.  They talked about the boat and then about Homer \par
and his crew for several minutes.  Suddenly Nick looked at his watch.  "Jesus \par
Christ," he said.  "It's after four o'clock.  Weren't we supposed to meet Carol \par
Dawson at four?"\par
\tab Troy jumped out of his chair.  "We sure were.  Some partners we turned out \par
to be," he was grinning again, "spending the entire afternoon drinking beer and \par
playing games."  The two men shared a small hug, threw the empty beer cans in \par
the trash, and went out the door toward Nick's car.\par

CAROL was clearly irritated as she sat in the communications room at the \par
Marriott.  She was drumming her fingers on the desk while she listened to the \par
telephone ring.  There was a click and then Nick's voice said, "I am not at home \par
at the present time.  But if \emdash  "  She flipped the switch off hastily and \par
completed the sentence, her sardonic mimicry releasing some of her frustration, \par
"But if you'll leave your name, your number, and the time that you called, I'll \par
get back to you as soon as I return.  S-h-i-t.  Shit.  I knew I should have \par
called before I left Miami."\par
\tab She dialed another number.  Bernice answered and put her right through (on \par
video) to Dr. Dale Michaels.  Carol did not bother with a greeting.  "Can you \par
believe that I can't even find the stupid bastard?  He's not on his boat, he's \par
not at home.  Nobody knows where he is.  I could have stayed in Miami and taken \par
a nap."\par
\tab Carol had not told Dr. Dale much about Nick and Troy.  And what she had \par
said about Nick had not been flattering.\par
\tab\'b7 'Well, what did you expect?"  Dale responded.  "You wanted to go out \par
with amateurs as a cover.  Why would you think that he would be easy to find \par
before your appointment?  That kind usually stays in bed with his dame of the \par
day until he has some reason to greet the world."  Dale chuckled to himself\par
\tab Carol found herself strangely annoyed by Dale's disdainful comment about \par
Nick's love life.  She started to say something but decided against it.  "Say, \par
Dale," she said instead, "is this phone line absolutely secure?  I have a couple \par
of sensitive items to discuss with you."\par
\tab He smiled.  "Nothing to worry about.  I have sensors that flash if there \par
is the slightest unexplained break anywhere in the line.  Even on your end."\par
\tab "Good," Carol replied.  She pulled out her notebook and scanned a \par
handwritten list.  " As far as Arnie Webber knows," she said, looking up at the \par
video camera, "there are no legal prohibitions against salvaging any U. S. \par
government property, provided it is returned to its rightful owner very soon \par
after its retrieval.  So I wouldn't technically be committing a crime if I pull \par
the missile up."  She checked the first item off her list.\par
\tab "But, Dale, I thought about something else on the flight down here from \par
Miami.  This thing is, after all, some kind of guided missile.  What if it blows \par
up?  Am I crazy to worry about such a thing?  Or is it somehow incapacitated or \par
what-ever by sitting down there in the sand and salt water for several days?"\par
\tab Dale laughed.  "Sometimes, Carol, you're divine.  I am fairly confident \par
that the new missile is designed to operate either in the air or in water.  And \par
I don't think that the sand would be able to foul up its critical parts in a \par
short period of time.  However, the fact that it hasn't exploded yet suggests to \par
me that it probably wasn't armed in the first place, except possibly for a small \par
destruct device that may or may not have already failed.  You are taking a \par
calculated risk in retrieving that missile.  I still strongly suggest that you \par
make your dive, obtain the photographs, and then go public with the story.  \par
Dredging the missile up for display purposes seems to me to be more of a stunt \par
than journalism.  Besides, it's dangerous."\par
\tab Carol was curt.  "As I said in the car, you are entitled to your opinion.  \par
The Navy could make a case that I faked the pictures somehow.  But they cannot \par
argue with a missile that has physical presence and can clearly be seen by a \par
nationwide television audience.  I want maximum impact for the story."\par
\tab She checked another item off the list in her notebook.  "Oh, yes, I forgot \par
to mention this morning that I met another boat captain down here, a bit of a \par
creep actually, an older fat man named Homer.  He seemed to recognize me almost \par
immediately.  Wealthy, big yacht and all that.  Strange crew \emdash  "\par
\tab "Was his last name Ashford?  Homer Ashford?"  Dale interrupted her.\par
\tab Carol nodded.  "So you know him?" she asked.\par
\tab "Certainly," Dale replied.  "He was the leader of the expedition that \par
found the Santa Rosa treasure in 1986.  You've met him too, although it's \par
obvious you've forgotten.  He and his wife were guests at the MOI awards banquet \par
early in 1993."  Dale stopped to think.  "That's right.  I remember now, you \par
were real late coming to the party because of that threat made against you by \par
Juan Salvador.  But I'm surprised you forgot them, the wife especially.  She was \par
a great big fat woman and she thought you were the cat's pajamas."\par
\tab Slowly but surely it all clicked in Carol's memory.  She recalled a \par
bizarre evening right after she first started going with Dale.  She had run a \par
piece in the Herald on cocaine trafficking and had suggested that the Cuban city \par
councilman, Juan Salvador, was deliberately inhibiting the police \par
investigations.  At noon that day, a usually reliable source had called her \par
editor at the paper and told him that Senor Salvador had just purchased a \par
contract on Carol's life.  The Herald had assigned her a bodyguard and \par
recommended that she alter her normal schedule so that her whereabouts would \par
always be uncertain.\par
\tab The evening of the MOI banquet Carol was in a fog.  The bodyguard had been \par
with her for only three hours and already she felt confined and restricted.  But \par
Carol had been genuinely frightened by the threat.  At the banquet she had \par
scrutinized every face, looking for an assassin, waiting for someone to make a \par
move.  As she sat in the hotel communications room fourteen months later, she \par
did vaguely remember meeting Homer (he had been dressed in a tux) and some jolly \par
fat woman who had followed her around for twenty minutes or so.  Damnit, Carol \par
thought.  It's my memory again.  I should have recognized him immediately.  How \par
stupid of me.\par
\tab "Okay," Carol said to Dale, "I remember them now.  But why were they at \par
the MOI awards banquet?"\par
\tab "We were honoring our leading benefactors that night," Dale replied.  \par
"Homer and Ellen have been big supporters of our underwater sentry effort.  In \par
fact, he has field tested many of our prototypes at his facility there in Key \par
West.  Real solid test data too.  Best compilation of sentry/intruder responses \par
that anybody has catalogued.  Why? it was Ashford who showed us how the MQ-6 \par
could be fooled \emdash  "\par
\tab "Okay, Okay," Carol said, realizing that her tolerance threshold was still \par
extremely low.  "Thanks for the information.  It's now a quarter till four.  I'm \par
going to go down to the marina to meet Nick Williams and make arrangements for \par
tomorrow.  If anything new comes up, I'll call you at home tonight."\par
\tab "Ciao," said Dale Michaels.  trying without success to sound \par
sophisticated, "and please be careful."\par
\tab Carol hung up the phone with a sigh.  She wondered if she should spend a \par
minute or two figuring out where she and Dale were going.  Or not going.  As the \par
case may be.  She thought about all the things she needed to do.  She closed her \par
notebook and rose from her chair.  Not right now, she thought I don't have time \par
now to think about Dale.  But as soon as I have a break in this crazy life of \par
mine.\par
\par
\tab Carol was really fuming when she walked back into the marina headquarters \par
the second time.  She approached the information desk with fire in her eyes.  \par
"Miss," she said nastily to Julianne, "as I told you fifteen minutes ago, I had \par
an appointment here at four o'clock with Nick Williams and Troy Jefferson.  It \par
is now, as you can see, after four-thirty."\par
\tab Carol pointed at the digital clock with an impatient, sweeping gesture \par
that commanded Julianne to look.  "We have both established independently that \par
Mr. Williams is not home," Carol continued.  "Now ate you going to give me Mr. \par
Jefterson's phone number, or should I make a scene?"\par
\tab Julianne did not like Carol or her obvious attitude of superiority.  She \par
held her ground.  "As I told you, Miss Dawson," she said politely but with a \par
biting overtone, "marina policy prohibits our giving out the phone numbers of \par
the independent boat owners or their crew members.  It's a question of privacy.  \par
Now if you had a formal charter through the marina," Julianne continued, \par
enjoying her moment of glory, "then it would be our job to assist you.  But as I \par
said earlier, we have no record \emdash  "\par
\tab "Goddamn it, I know that," replied Carol furiously.  She slammed the \par
envelope of photos that she was carrying down on Julianne's counter.  "I'm not \par
an imbecile.  We've been through this before.  I told you I was supposed to meet \par
them here at four o'clock.  Now if you won't help me, I want to talk to your \par
superior, the assistant manager of whatever."\par
\tab "Fine," said Julianne, her eyes firing darts of contempt at Carol.  "If \par
you will just take a seat over there, I will see if I can locate \emdash  "\par
\tab "I will not take a seat," shouted Carol in exasperation.  "I want to see \par
him now.  This is an issue of extreme urgency.  Now pick up the phone and \emdash  "\par
\tab "Is something wrong here?  Perhaps I can help."  Carol spun around.  Homer \par
Ashford was standing right behind her.  Just to the right, toward the gate in \par
the direction of the jetties, Greta and a big heavy woman (That's Ellen.  Now I \par
remember her, Carol thought) were talking quietly.  Ellen smiled at Carol.  \par
Greta looked right through her.\par
\tab "Well, hello, Captain Homer," Julianne said sweetly, "it's nice of you to \par
ask.  But I think everything's under control.  Miss Dawson here has just \par
indicated that she does not accept my explanation of marina policy.  She is \par
going to wait for \emdash  "\par
\tab "Maybe you can help," Carol interrupted Julianne defiantly.  "I had an \par
appointment here at four o'clock with Nick Williams and Troy Jefferson.  They \par
have not shown up.  Do you by any chance happen to know Troy's phone number?"\par
\tab Captain Homer gave Carol a suspicious look and exchanged a knowing glance \par
with Ellen and Greta.  He turned back to Carol.  "Well, it is certainly a \par
surprise, Miss Dawson, to see you back here again.  Why we were just talking \par
about you this morning, saying that we hoped you had a good time on your free \par
day in Key West."  He paused for effect.  "Now I wonder why you've come back \par
here again, the very next day.  And did I hear correctly, you need to see \par
Williams and Jefferson on an issue of extreme urgency?  It couldn't possibly \par
have anything to do with all that equipment you brought in here yesterday, could \par
it?  Or the little gray bag that Williams has been guarding since last night?"\par
\tab Uh oh, thought Carol, as Greta and Ellen moved in around her.  I'm \par
surrounded.  Captain Homer started to pick up the sealed envelope on Julianne's \par
counter but Carol stopped him.\par
\tab "If you don't mind, Captain Ashford," she said firmly, taking his hand off \par
the envelope and putting the photos under her arm.  She lowered her voice.  "I \par
would like to talk to you privately."  Carol nodded her head at the two women.  \par
"Can we go out in the parking lot together for a minute?"\par
\tab Homer's beady eyes squinted at her.  Then his face broke into the same \par
obnoxious, lecherous smile that Carol had seen on the Ambrosia.  "Certainly, my \par
dear," he said.  He shouted to Greta and Ellen as he walked out the door with \par
Carol, "Wait here.  I'll only be a minute."\par
\tab Necessity is the mother of invention, Carol thought to herself as she led \par
Homer Ashford out the door.  So invent, bitch.  And now.  As in this moment.\par
\tab They walked up the steps to the parking lot.  Carol turned to Captain \par
Homer at the top of the steps with a conspiratorial look on her face.  "I can \par
tell that you've figured out why I'm here," she said.  "I didn't want it this \par
way, I thought it would make a better story if nobody knew what I was doing.  \par
But you're obviously too clever for me."  Homer grinned foolishly.  "But I would \par
ask you to tell as few people as possible.  You can tell your wife and Greta, \par
but please nobody else. The Herald wants it to be a surprise."\par
\tab Homer looked puzzled.  Carol leaned over and almost whispered in his ear.  \par
"The entire Sunday magazine section the fourth week in April.  Isn't that \par
unbelievable?  Working title, 'Dreams of Being Rich,' stories about people like \par
you, like Mel Fisher, like the four Floridians who have won over a million \par
dollars each in the lottery.  On how sudden income changes your life.  I'm doing \par
the whole piece.  I'm starting with the treasure angle because of its general \par
interest."\par
\tab Carol could see that Captain Homer was reeling.  She knew she had him off \par
guard.  "Yesterday I just wanted to check your boat quickly, see how you lived, \par
see how it would photograph.  I freaked out a little when you recognized me so \par
fast.  But I had always planned to go out with Williams first."  Carol laughed.  \par
"My treasure-finding equipment from MOI faked him out.  He still thinks I am a \par
genuine treasure seeker.  I almost completed my whole interview with him \par
yesterday.  I only came back today to finish a couple of small items."\par
\tab An alert went off in Homer Ashford's system when Carol talked about faking \par
out Nick Williams.  Homer wasn't certain he believed this smooth reporter's \par
story even now.  He mused to himself that her story was plausible, but there was \par
still one big unanswered question.  "But what is Williams carrying around in \par
that bag?" he asked.\par
\tab "That," said Carol, sensing his distrust, "is nothing."  She raised her \par
eyebrows and laughed again.  "Or almost anyway.  We pulled up a worthless old \par
trinket yesterday afternoon so I could photograph the salvage process for the \par
story.  I told him to have it appraised today.  He thinks I'm an eccentric.  He \par
must be keeping it hidden in the bag because he's embarrassed and doesn't want \par
anybody to see him with it."\par
\tab Carol lightly hit Captain Homer in the ribs with her elbow.  He shook his \par
head.  Part of him realized he was being told a very clever lie.  But somehow \par
enough of it made sense that Homer couldn't pierce the deception.  His brow \par
furrowed for a moment.  "So I guess you'll want to talk to us when you're \par
through with the other two .  .  ."\par
\tab At just that moment, unbeknownst to Carol, Nick and Troy drove into the \par
marina parking lot.  They were still slightly drunk and silly.  "Lawdy, lawdy," \par
said Troy, spotting Carol and Captain Homer in conversation, "I believe my eyes \par
have screwed up.  They're sending a picture of a beauty and a beast to my brain.  \par
It's Miss Carol Dawson together with our favorite fat captain.  Now what do you \par
suppose they're talking about?"\par
\tab "I don't know," said Nick, bridling instantly, "but I'm damn sure going to \par
find out.  If she's double-crossing us .  .  .  ."  He pulled the car quickly \par
into a parking place and started to jump out.  Troy reached across and \par
restrained him.\par
\tab "Now why don't you let me handle this one?"  Troy said.  "Humor may be \par
just the right ticket here."\par
\tab Nick thought for a moment.  "Maybe you're right," he said.  "I'll let you \par
go first."\par
\par
\tab Troy walked into view just as Carol and Captain Homer were finishing their \par
conversation.  "Helloooo, angel," he said from forty yards away, "what's \par
happening?"\par
\tab Carol held her hand up in acknowledgment but didn't turn around to greet \par
Troy.  "So that's 2748 Columbia, just beyond the Pelican Resort, at eight-thirty \par
tomorrow night?"\par
\tab "Right," replied Homer Ashford.  He nodded his head in Troy's direction \par
and started to leave.  'We'll be ready for you.  Bring plenty of tape, for it's \par
a long story."  He made a peculiar clucking sound with his mouth.  "And plan to \par
stay for a little party afterward."\par
\tab Homer was already halfway down the steps when Troy walked up beside Carol.  \par
"Hello, Captain Homer.  Good-bye, Captain Homer," he said quietly, still playing \par
the comic.  He leaned over to kiss Carol on the cheek.  "Hi there, angel .  .  \par
."\par
\tab "Yuch," Carol pulled her cheek away.  "You smell like brewery.  No wonder \par
I've had to look all over town for you two."  She saw Nick coming toward them \par
across the parking lot.  He was carrying the exercise bag.  She raised her \par
voice.  "Well, Mr. Williams, what a pleasant surprise.  How nice that you and \par
your brother here could climb down from your bar stools long enough to keep our \par
appointment."  She looked at her watch.  "My, my," she said in her most \par
sarcastic voice, "we are certainly fashionably late.  Let's see, if one waits \par
fifteen minutes for a full professor, how long does one wait for a fake \par
professor?"\par
\tab "Knock off the bullshit, Miss High and Mighty," Nick said, responding \par
angrily to her barbs.  He joined Carol and Troy and then caught his breath.  "We \par
have a few bones to pick with you as well," he continued.  "Just what were you \par
doing talking to that asshole Ashford?"\par
\tab Nick sounded threatening.  Carol recoiled.  "Listen to him," she said, \par
"the typical macho male.  Always shifts the blame to the woman.  'Hey bitch,' he \par
says, 'forget I'm late, forget I'm an arrogant bastard, it was your fault anyway \par
.  .  .' "\par
\tab "Hey, hey .  .  .  hey," Troy interceded.  Carol and Nick were glowering \par
at each other.  They both started to speak but Troy interrupted them again.  \par
"Children, children, please," he continued, "I have something important to say."  \par
They both looked at him.  Troy raised his arms for quiet.  Then he adopted a \par
stiff pose and pretended to be reading.  " 'Fourscore and seven years ago, our \par
forefathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation .  .  .' "\par
\tab Carol cracked up first.  "Troy," she said, smiling despite her anger, " \par
you are something else.  You are also ridiculous."\par
\tab A grinning Troy punched Nick on the shoulder.  "How did I do, Professor?  \par
Would I make a good Lincoln?  Could a nice young black boy play Lincoln for the \par
white folks?"\par
\tab Nick smiled reluctantly and looked down at the macadam while Troy \par
jabbered.  When Troy was finished, Nick's tone to Carol was conciliatory.  "I'm \par
sorry we were late," he said in measured tones, "we forgot what time it was.  \par
Here's the trident."\par
\tab Carol recognized how difficult it had been for Nick to apologize.  She \par
accepted gracefully with a short smile and a gesture with her hands.  "You keep \par
the trident for a little while longer," she said after a brief silence.  "We \par
have a lot of other things to talk about."  She looked around.  "But this may be \par
the wrong place and the wrong time."\par
\tab Both Nick and Troy were giving her questioning looks.  "I have some very \par
exciting news," she explained, "some of which is here in your copy of the \par
pictures that I developed this morning.  Bottom line is that the telescope \par
picked up an infrared signal coming out of the fissure from some kind of large \par
object or objects."  She turned to Nick.  "It may be more treasure.  We can t be \par
certain what it is based on the images."\par
\tab Nick reached for the envelope.  Carol pulled it away.  "Not here, not now.  \par
Too many eyes and ears.  Take my word for it.  What we have to do now is make \par
plans.  Can you two take me out again tomorrow morning early and be prepared to \par
salvage objects possibly as big as two hundred pounds?  Of course, I intend to \par
pay for chartering the boat again."\par
\tab "Wow," whistled Nick, "two hundred pounds!  I can hardly wait to see the \par
pictures .  " He was sobering up rapidly .  " We'll need to borrow a dredger and \par
\emdash  "\par
\tab "I still have the telescope so we can use it again," Carol added.  She \par
looked at her watch.  "It's almost five o'clock now, how much preparation time \par
do you need?"\par
\tab "Three hours, four hours at the most," Nick said, calculating swiftly.  \par
"With Troy's help, of course," he added.\par
\tab "Gladly, my friends," Troy replied.  "And since Angie has reserved a \par
special table for me at Sloppy Joe's for her ten-thirty show tonight, why don't \par
we meet there and go over the details for tomorrow?"\par
\tab "Angie Leatherwood is a friend of yours?"  Carol said, obviously \par
impressed.  "I haven't seen her since she made the big time."  She paused for a \par
second and handed the envelope to Nick.  "Look at these images in private.  The \par
whole set was taken just under the boat where we were diving.  Some are \par
obviously blowups of others.  It may take a little time for your eyes to adjust \par
to all the colors.  But it's the brown object or objects that we're after."  \par
Carol could tell that both of the men were eager to see the pictures.  She \par
walked with them toward Nick's car.  "So I'll see both of you tonight at Sloppy \par
Joe's about ten-fifteen."  She turned to head for her own parking place.\par
\tab "Uh, Carol, just a minute," Nick stopped her.  Carol waited while Nick, \par
suddenly awkward, tried to figure out a nice way to ask his question.  "Would \par
you mind telling us why you were talking to Captain Homer?" he at last said \par
tactfully.\par
\tab Carol looked at Nick and Troy for a minute and then laughed.  "I ran into \par
him while I was in the office trying to call you guys.  He wanted to know about \par
the piece we retrieved yesterday.  I put him off the track by telling him I was \par
doing a feature article on all members of the crew that found the Santa Rosa \par
treasure eight years ago."\par
\tab Nick glanced at Troy with mock disgust "You see, Jefferson," he said with \par
exaggerated emphasis.  "I told you there was a legitimate explanation."  The two \par
men waved at Carol as she headed for her car.\par

\par
LIEUTENANT Todd," the commander said with exasperation, "I am beginning to think \par
that the U.S. Navy has overestimated your intelligence or experience or both.  \par
It is beyond me how you can continue even to consider the possibility that the \par
Panther was commanded off course by the Russians, particularly in light of the \par
new information you presented this afternoon."\par
\tab "But, sir," the younger man answered stubbornly "it is still a viable \par
hypothesis.  And you yourself said in the meeting that a good failure analysis \par
does not exclude any reasonable possibility."\par
\tab The two men were in Commander Winters' office.  The commander walked over \par
to look out the window.  It was almost dark outside.  The air was heavy, still, \par
and humid.  Thunderstorms were building over the ocean to the south.  The base \par
was nearly empty.  At length Winters looked at his watch, heaved a sigh, and \par
came back across the room toward Lieutenant Todd.  He was smiling only slightly.\par
\tab "You listened well, Lieutenant.  But the operative word here is \par
'reasonable.' Let's review the facts.  Did I or did I not hear correctly that \par
your telemetry analysis unit found this afternoon that the commands rejected \par
counter on the bird also incremented during the flight, beginning as early as \par
off the coast of New Brunswick?  And that, apparently, over one thousand command \par
messages were rejected as the missile made its way down the Atlantic Coast?  How \par
do you propose to explain all this in terms of your scenario?  Did the Russians \par
deploy an entire fleet of ships along the flight path, just to confuse and \par
capture one solitary Navy test missile?"\par
\tab Commander Winters was now standing directly in front of the taller young \par
lieutenant.  "Or maybe you believe," he continued sarcastically, before Todd \par
could respond, "that the Russians have a new secret weapon that flies alongside \par
a missile going at Mach 6 and talks to it en route.  Come on, Lieutenant, on \par
what reasonable grounds do you consider this bizarre Russian hypothesis of yours \par
still viable?"\par
\tab Lieutenant Todd did not yield.  "Sir," he answered, "none of the other \par
possible explanations for the missile's behavior makes any more sense at this \par
stage.  You now say that you believe it's a software problem; however, our very \par
brightest programmers cannot imagine how the only external indication of a \par
major, system-level software malfunction could be that two, and only two, \par
command counters go haywire.  They have checked all the internal software \par
diagnostic data that was telemetered to the ground and they can find no \par
problems.  Besides, the pre-release checkout indicates that all the software was \par
working fine just seconds before the flight began.\par
\tab "And we know something else.  Ramirez has learned from Washington that \par
there have been peculiar movements in the Russian submarine fleet off the \par
Florida coast in the last forty-eight hours.  I'm not saying that the Russian \par
hypothesis, as you call it, is the answer.  Just that until we have a more \par
satisfactory explanation of a failure mechanism that could cause both command \par
counters to increment, it makes sense to carry one option that assumes maybe the \par
Panther was actually commanded."\par
\tab Winters shook his head "All right, Lieutenant," he said finally.  "I will \par
not order you to take it off the list.  But I will order you to concentrate this \par
weekend on finding the missile in the ocean somewhere and identifying a hardware \par
and/or software problem that could have caused either the command counter \par
anomaly or the change in the flight path or both.  There must be an explanation \par
that does not involve operations on a massive scale by the Russians."\par
\tab Todd started to walk around Winters and leave.  "Just a minute," the \par
commander said, his eyes narrowing.  "I don't believe it's necessary, is it \par
Lieutenant, to remind you of who will be held responsible if the outside world \par
gets wind of this Russian business?"\par
\tab "No, Commander .  .  .  sir," was the answer.\par
\tab "Then carry on," said Winters, "and let me know if there are any \par
significant new developments."\par
\par
\tab Commander Winters was in a hurry.  He had called the theater right after \par
Todd had left and told Melvin Burton that he was going to be late.  He drove \par
quickly into a hamburger stand, wolfed down a burger and fries, and headed for \par
the marina area.\par
\tab He arrived at the theater when most of the rest of the cast was already \par
dressed.  Melvin met him at the door.  "Quickly now, Commander, we have no time \par
to spare.  The makeup must be correct the first time."  He looked nervously at \par
his watch.  "You're in the pulpit in exactly forty-two minutes."  The commander \par
entered the men's dressing room, took off his Navy uniform, and put on the dour \par
black and white regalia of an Episcopal priest.  Outside the door to the \par
dressing room Melvin paced back and forth, going through a final checklist in \par
his mind.\par
\tab Commander Winters was in the pulpit when the curtain rose.  He had a \par
strong case of normal opening-night jitters.  He looked across the three rows of \par
his stage congregation to the full audience in the theater.  He saw his wife \par
Betty and son Hap in the second row.  Winters smiled at them quickly before the \par
applause died down.  Then his nervousness disappeared as he launched into \par
Shannon's sermon.\par
\tab The short prologue sped by quickly.  The lights dimmed another time for \par
fifteen seconds, the set changed automatically, and he was in the final scene, \par
walking into his hotel room in Mexico and still mumbling to himself phrases from \par
his letter.  Shannon/Winters sat down on his bed.  He heard a noise in the \par
corner of the room and looked up.  It was Charlotte/Tiffani.  Her gorgeous \par
auburn hair was down over her shoulders.  She was wearing a light blue silk \par
nightshirt, cut low in the middle, which her ample and upright breasts filled \par
completely.  He heard her say, "Larry, oh Larry, finally we're alone together," \par
and she came to sit beside him on the bed.  Her perfume filled his nostrils.  \par
Her hand was behind his head.  Her lips pressed against his, insistent, hard, \par
searching.  He pulled back.  Her lips followed, then her body.  He fell back on \par
the bed.  She crawled on top, her kisses continuing, her breasts pushed against \par
his pounding chest.  He put his arms around her, slowly at first, and then, \par
lying on his back, he enveloped her with a deep embrace.\par
\tab The lights flashed off and on for several seconds.  Charlotte/Tiffani slid \par
off of Winters and lay beside him on the bed.  He could hear her labored \par
breathing.  A voice was heard, "Charlotte."  Then again, with a loud knock on \par
the door, "Charlotte, I know you're in there."  The door sprang open.  The two \par
lovers half sat up in bed.  The lights went off and the curtain came down.  The \par
applause was loud and sustained.\par
\par
\tab Commander Vernon Winters pushed open the door and stumbled outside.  He \par
was at the alley entrance to the theater.  The door, over which was a single \par
light bulb covered with insects, opened onto a small wooden platform a few steps \par
above the pavement.  Winters walked down the three steps and stood beside the \par
red brick wall of the theater.  He pulled out a cigarette and lit it.\par
\tab He watched the smoke curl upward against the red brick.  In the distance \par
there was a burst of lightning, then a pause before the sound of rolling \par
thunder.  He inhaled deeply again and tried to understand what he had been \par
feeling during those five or ten seconds with Tiffani.  I wonder if they could \par
tell, he thought.  I wonder if it was obvious to everyone.  When he had changed \par
clothes for the first full act of the play, he had noticed the telltale tracks \par
on his undershorts.  He expelled some more smoke and winced.  And that little \par
girl.  My God.  She knows for sure.  She must have felt it when she was on top \par
of me.\par
\tab Despite himself, he recaptured for an instant his excitement when Tiffani \par
had pressed herself against him.  His breath shortened.  A first tinge of guilt \par
began to manifest itself.  My God, he thought again.  What am I?  I'm a dirty \par
old man.  For some reason he found himself thinking of Joanna Carr, of a night \par
almost twenty-five years ago.  He remembered the moment when he took her .  .  .\par
\tab "Commander," he heard a voice say.  He turned around.  Tiffani was \par
standing on the platform in her T-shirt and jeans, her long hair down over her \par
shoulders.  Now she was walking down the steps toward him.  "Commander," she \par
said again with a mysterious smile, "may I have a cigarette?"\par
\tab He was dumbfounded, stupefied.  He said nothing.  Winters automatically \par
reached into his pocket and pulled out his pack of Pall Malls.  The girl took \par
one, packed it against her fingernail, and slid it into her mouth.  She waited a \par
second, maybe two.  Then she gave him another smile.  Winters at last woke up \par
and produced his cheap supermarket lighter.  She cupped his trembling hand and \par
inhaled vigorously on the cigarette.\par
\tab Winters watched her, fascinated, as she pulled the smoke into her lungs.  \par
He studied her mouth, her white neck, her uplifted chest as she caressed the \par
smoke.  With the same rapt attention, he watched her diaphragm subside and the \par
smoke curl out of her pursed lips.\par
\tab They stood there together, quietly smoking, neither speaking.  Over the \par
ocean there was another flash of lightning, another roll of thunder.  Each time \par
that Tiffani would put the cigarette in her mouth, the mesmerized Winters would \par
follow her every move.  She would inhale deeply, intently, pulling hard on the \par
cigarette for the nicotine her body cherished.  He was only vaguely aware of his \par
jumbled thoughts.\par
\tab She's beautiful, so beautiful.  Young and fresh and full of life.  And \par
that hair.  How I would love to wrap it around my neck .  .  .  but she's not a \par
little girl.  She's a young woman.  She must sense what I'm feeling, my \par
fascination for her .  .  .  she smokes as I do.  With complete concentration.  \par
She caresses .  .  .\par
\tab "I love stormy nights," Tiffani broke the silence as still another distant \par
flash of lightning lit up the sky.  She moved closer to him and then craned her \par
neck to see around a group of trees that was blocking her view of the cloud \par
formation where the lightning was occurring.  She brushed against Commander \par
Winters ever so slightly.  He was electrified.\par
\tab His mouth was dry.  His body was suffused with desire, a desire he barely \par
recognized.  He could not answer her comment.  Instead he stared off at the \par
growing storm and took the final drag from his cigarette.\par
\tab She too finished her cigarette and dropped it on the pavement.  As she \par
turned to face him and their eyes met, the last wisps of smoke were playfully \par
wandering across her lips.  She gave a quick, flirtatious blow with her mouth \par
and Winters felt a burst of lust in his groin.  He retained his self-control and \par
they entered the theater in silence.\par
\par
\tab The applause continued.  Commander Winters brought the women who had \par
played Maxine and Hannah, one on either side of him, forward for their final \par
bow, just as they had planned before the performance began.  The applause \par
intensified.  Again he stared at the empty seats where Betty and Hap had been \par
before the intermission.  He heard a voice from the audience shout "Charlotte \par
Goodall" and Winters improvised.  He took the two ladies back to the line of the \par
assembled cast and walked down the line to Tiffani.  For a moment she did not \par
understand.  Then her face broke into a radiant smile and she took his hand.\par
\tab He walked forward with her to the front of the stage.  their hands wrapped \par
together in a tight hold.  This was her special moment.  She was near tears as \par
she heard the applause grow again.  He stood aside and she bowed gracefully to \par
the audience.  She finished her bow, took his hand again with a delightful \par
squeeze, and backed up into the line with the cast.\par
\tab Melvin, Marc, and Amanda were all backstage while they were dressing.  \par
Enthusiastic congratulations were everywhere.  Melvin particularly seemed \par
ecstatic.  He admitted that he had had some misgivings during rehearsals, but \par
that everyone had been wonderful.  The director confided to Winters that the \par
bedroom scene with Tiffani had been "superb \emdash  couldn't have been better," as \par
Melvin literally danced out the dressing room door.\par
\tab Winters was overwhelmed with a myriad of emotions.  He was pleased with \par
his performance in the play and the audience reception, but other more personal \par
things were on his mind.  What had happened to Betty and Hap?  Why had they left \par
at intermission?  In his mind's eye, Winters imagined Betty watching his love \par
scene with Tiffani.  He had a momentary panic as he convinced himself that she \par
had known, from out in the audience, that her husband was not acting at all, \par
that he was every bit as aroused as the character he was playing.\par
\tab What had occurred with Tiffani he could not begin to understand and could \par
not even think about without starting to feel guilty.  While he was putting back \par
on his Navy uniform, he allowed himself to taste again her kisses on the bed in \par
the play and to feel the sexual tension while they smoked together in the alley.  \par
But beyond his awareness of his arousal he would not go.  Guilt was a depressing \par
emotion, and on his successful opening night he did not want to be depressed.\par
\tab When Commander Winters walked out of the men's communal dressing room, \par
Tiffani was waiting for him.  Her hair was back in pigtails, her face scrubbed \par
free of makeup.  She looked again like a little girl.  "Commander," she said, \par
almost with servility, "would you do me a favor, please?"  He smiled his assent.  \par
She beckoned to him and he followed her out in the hall that was adjacent to the \par
backstage quarters.\par
\tab A red-haired man about the commander's age was standing in the hall, \par
nervously smoking a cigarette and pacing.  It was obvious that he felt \par
uncomfortable and out of place.  Next to him was a tawdry brunette, early \par
thirties perhaps, chewing gum and talking to the man in a whisper.  The man \par
noticeably relaxed when he saw the commander in his uniform.\par
\tab "Well, sir," he said to Winters when Tiffani introduced him as her father, \par
"it's good to meet you.  I don't know much about this acting business, but I \par
worry that it's unhealthy for my daughter sometimes."  He winked at his wife, \par
Tiffani's stepmother, and lowered his voice.  "You know, sir, with all the wimps \par
and fags and other weirdo actors, a man can't be too careful.  But Tiff told me \par
there was a real Navy officer, a bona fide commander, as part of the cast.  At \par
first I didn't believe her."\par
\tab Mr. Thomas was definitely getting signals both from Tiffani and his wife.  \par
He was talking too much.  "I'm regular Navy myself," he blurted out as Winters \par
remained silent, "almost twenty-five years.  Signed up when I was just a boy of \par
eighteen.  Met Tiff's mother two years later \emdash  "\par
\tab "Daddy," Tiffani interrupted him, "you promised that you wouldn't \par
embarrass me.  Please just ask him.  He probably has things that he needs to \par
do."\par
\tab The commander had certainly not been prepared to meet Tiffani's father and \par
stepmother.  In fact, he had never for a moment even thought about her parents, \par
although as he stood there, listening to Mr. Thomas, it all made sense.  Tiffani \par
was, after all, only a junior in high school.  So of course she lives at home, \par
he thought.  With her parents.  Mr. Thomas was looking very serious.  For about \par
a second Winters felt fear and the beginning of panic.  No.  No, he thought \par
quickly, she can't have told them anything.  It's all much too soon.\par
\tab "My wife and I play bridge," Mr. Thomas was saying, "duplicate bridge, in \par
tournaments.  And this weekend there's a big sectional in Miami.  We'll be \par
leaving tomorrow morning and coming back very late on Sunday night."\par
\tab Winters was puzzled.  He was lost in this conversation.  Why should he \par
care about what the Thomases did with their free time?  At length Mr. Thomas \par
came to the point.  "So we had called Mae's cousin in Marathon and asked her if \par
she would pick my daughter up after the show tomorrow night.  But that would \par
mean Tiff would have to miss the cast party.  Tiff suggested that maybe you \par
would be willing to see her home safely from the party and," Mr. Thomas smiled \par
pleasantly, "keep a fatherly eye on her while I'm off playing bridge."\par
\tab Winters instinctively glanced at Tiffani.  For just a few milliseconds he \par
saw a worldly look in her eyes that tore through him like a fireball.  Then she \par
was a little girl again, entreating her father to let her go to the party.\par
\tab The commander played his role well.  "All right, Mr. Thomas," he replied, \par
"I'll be glad to help you out."  He patted Tiffani fondly.  "She deserves to go \par
to the party, she's worked hard.  "He paused for a moment.  "But I have a couple \par
of questions.  There will certainly be champagne at the party and it will \par
probably go real late.  Does she have a curfew?  How do you feel about \emdash  "\par
\tab "Just use your own judgment, Commander," Mr. Thomas cut him short.  "Mae \par
and I trust you completely."  The man reached over and shook Winters' hand.  \par
"And thank you very much.  By the way," he added, as he turned around to leave, \par
"you were great, although I must admit I was worried when you were necking with \par
my daughter.  The fag that wrote the play must have been one weird dude."\par
\tab Tiffani's stepmother mumbled thanks over her chewing gum and the girl \par
herself said "See ya tomorrow" as the three of them walked away.  The commander \par
reached in his pocket for another cigarette.\par
\par
\tab Betty and Hap were both asleep, as Commander Winters knew they would be, \par
when he finally arrived home around eleven o'clock He walked softly past his \par
son's room but then stopped outside of Betty's.  Basically a considerate man, \par
Winters spent a few seconds weighing Betty's sleep against his need for an \par
explanation.  He decided to go in and wake her up.  He was surprised to find \par
that he was nervous when he sat down on the side of her bed in the dark.\par
\tab She was sleeping on her back with a sheet and a very thin blanket both \par
pulled up neatly to within about two inches of her shoulders.  He shook her \par
lightly.  "Betty, dear," he said.  "I'm home.  I'd like to talk to you."  She \par
stirred.  He shook her again.  "It's Vernon," he said softly.\par
\tab His wife sat up in bed and turned on the light on the end table.  \par
Underneath the light was a small picture of the face of Jesus, a man wise beyond \par
his thirty or so years, with a full beard, a serious look, and a glow \par
approximating a halo behind his head.  "Goodness," she said, frowning and \par
rubbing her eyes, "What's going on?  Is everything all right?"  Betty had never \par
been particularly pretty.  But in the last ten years she had ignored her looks \par
altogether and had even put on twenty pounds of ungainly weight.\par
\tab "Yes," he answered.  "I just wanted to talk.  And to find out why you and \par
Hap left the show just after the intermission."\par
\tab Betty looked him directly in the eyes.  This was a woman without guile, \par
even without nuance.  Life was simple and straightforward for her.  If you truly \par
believed in God and Jesus Christ, then you had no doubts.  About anything.  \par
"Vernon," she began, "I have often wondered why you choose to perform in such \par
strange plays.  But I have never complained about it, particularly since it \par
seems to be the only thing that has excited you in a good way since Libya and \par
that awful beach incident."\par
\tab She frowned and a cloud seemed to cross her face momentarily.  Then she \par
continued in her matter-of-fact way.  "But Hap is no longer a child.  He is \par
becoming a young man.  And hearing his father, even in a play, refer to God as a \par
'petulant old man' and a 'senile delinquent' is not likely to strengthen his \par
faith."  She looked away.  "And I thought it was equally disturbing for him to \par
watch you groping with that young girl.  All in all," she said, glancing back at \par
her husband and summarizing the entire issue, "I thought the play had no values, \par
no morals, and nothing worth staying for."\par
\tab Winters felt his anger building but struggled with it, as he always did.  \par
He envied Betty her steadfast faith, her ability to see God clearly in every \par
daily activity.  He himself felt disjoint from the God of his childhood and his \par
fruitless personal searches had not yet resulted in a clearer perception of Him.  \par
But a couple of things Winters did know for certain.  His God would laugh with \par
and have compassion for Tennessee Williams' characters.  And He would not be \par
pleased by bombs falling on little children.\par
\tab The commander did not argue with Betty.  He gave her a brotherly kiss on \par
the cheek and she turned off the light.  For just a moment he wondered.  How \par
long has it been?  Three weeks?  But he couldn't remember the exact time.  Or \par
even whether or not it had been good.  They "fooled around," as Betty called it, \par
whenever her awareness of his need overcame her general lack of interest.  \par
Probably about normal for couples our age, Winters thought, somewhat \par
defensively, as he undressed in his room.\par
\tab But he was not able to sleep as he lay quietly in the dark underneath the \par
sheet.  The feeling of arousal that had been so intense first during the play \par
and then again out in the alley continued to call to him.  With pictures.  When \par
he closed his eyes he could again see Tiffani's soft and flirtatious lips \par
blowing out the last of the smoke that had been deep within her lungs.  His \par
mouth could still taste those passionate kisses that she had forced upon him \par
during the bedroom scene.  And then there was that special look when her father \par
had asked him to take care of her at the party.  Had he imagined it?\par
\tab Several times Commander Winters changed positions in his bed, trying to \par
dispel the images in his mind and the nervousness that was keeping him awake.  \par
He was unsuccessful.  Eventually, while he was lying on his back, he realized \par
there was one possible release from this kind of tension.  At first he felt \par
guilty, even embarrassed, but the waves of images of Tiffani continued to flood \par
into his brain.\par
\tab He touched himself.  The images from the day sharpened and began to expand \par
into fantasies.  She was lying on top of him on the bed, as she had been in the \par
play, and he was responding to her kisses.  For a brief second Winters became \par
frightened and held himself in check.  But a desperate surge of longing removed \par
his last inhibition.  He was again an adolescent, alone in his rich imagination.\par
\tab The scene in his mind changed.  He was lying naked on a huge king-size bed \par
in an opulent room with high ceilings.  Tiffani approached him from the lighted \par
bathroom, also naked, her long auburn hair cascading over her shoulders and \par
hiding the nipples of her breasts.  She took a last languorous pull from her \par
cigarette and put it out in the ashtray beside the bed, her eyes never leaving \par
his as she slowly, almost lovingly, expelled the last of the smoke from her \par
mouth.  She climbed into the bed beside him.  He could feel the softness of her \par
skin, the tingle of her long hair against his neck and chest.\par
\tab She kissed him gently but passionately, with her hands behind his head.  \par
He felt her tongue playing enticingly across his lips.  She moved her body into \par
position next to him and pressed her pelvis into his.  He felt himself rising.  \par
She took his penis in her hand and squeezed lightly.  He was completely erect.  \par
She squeezed again, then gracefully raised her body up and inserted him deep \par
inside her.  He felt a magical moist warmth and then exploded almost \par
immediately.\par
\tab Commander Winters was staggered by the power and the intensity of his \par
fantasy.  Somewhere inside him a voice cried for caution and warned of dire \par
consequences if he let this fantasy become too real.  But as he lay spent and \par
alone in his suburban home, he pushed his guilt and fears aside and allowed \par
himself the unrivaled bliss of post-orgasmic sleep.\par

\par
SLOPPY Joe's was an institution in Key West.  The favorite bar of Hemingway and \par
his motley crew had managed to adapt quickly to the multifaceted evolution of \par
the city that it had come to symbolize.  Many denizens of the old city had been \par
almost apoplectic when the bar had forsaken its historic location downtown and \par
moved into the vast shopping complex surrounding the new marina.  But even they \par
grudgingly admitted, after the club reopened in a well-ventilated large room \par
complete with sound stage and excellent acoustics, that the Tiffany lamps, long \par
wooden bars, narrow mirrors from ceiling to floor, and memorabilia from a \par
hundred years in Key West had been tastefully rearranged in a way that retained \par
the spirit of the old bar.\par
\tab It was altogether fitting that Angie Leatherwood should perform as the \par
headliner at Sloppy Joe's during her brief and infrequent returns to the city of \par
her birth.  Troy's glib tongue had originally talked the owner, a transplanted \par
fifty-year-old New Yorker named Tony Palazzo, into giving her an audition when \par
she was still nineteen.  Tony had heard her sing for five minutes and then had \par
exclaimed, punctuating his comments with wild hand gestures, "It's not enough \par
that you bring me a black girl who's so beautiful she takes your breath away.  \par
No, you bring me one who also sings like a nightingale.  Mama mia Life is not \par
fair.  My daughter Carla would kill to sound like that."  Tony had become \par
Angie's biggest fan and had unselfishly promoted her career.  Angie never forgot \par
what Tony had done for her and always sang at Sloppy Joe's when she was in town.  \par
She was like that.\par
\tab Troy's table was front and center, about ten feet away from the edge of \par
the stage.  Nick and Troy were already seated at the small round table and had \par
finished their first drinks when Carol arrived about five minutes before ten-\par
thirty.  She apologized and mumbled something about parking in Siberia.  As soon \par
as she arrived, Nick pulled out the envelope of images and both men told her \par
that they had found the pictures fascinating.  Nick began asking questions about \par
the photographs while Troy summoned a waiter.  Nick and Carol were involved in \par
an earnest conversation about the objects in the fissure when the new drinks \par
reached the table.  Nick had just mentioned that one of them looked like a \par
modern missile.  It was ten thirty-five.  The lights flashed off and on to \par
announce that the show was beginning.\par
\tab Angie Leatherwood was a consummate performer.  Like many of the very best \par
entertainers, she never forgot that it was the audience that was the customer, \par
that it was they who both created her image and enhanced her mystique.  She \par
began with the title song from her new album, "Memories of Enchanting Nights," \par
and then sang a medley of Whitney Houston songs, according a tribute to that \par
brilliant songstress whose talent had sparked Angie's own desire to sing.  Next \par
she showed her versatility by blending a quartet of songs with different beats, \par
a Jamaican reggae, a soft ballad from her first album, Love Letters, a nearly \par
perfect Diana Ross imitation from an old Supremes song, "Where Did Our Love Go?" \par
and an emotionally powerful, lilting encomium to her blind father entitled "The \par
Man with Vision."\par
\tab Thunderous applause greeted the conclusion of each song.  Sloppy Joe's was \par
sold out, including all the standing room along the hundred-foot bar.  Seven \par
different huge video screens scattered throughout the spacious club brought \par
Angie home to those who were not close to the stage.  This was her crowd, these \par
were her friends.  A couple of times Angie was almost embarrassed because the \par
clapping and the bravos would not stop.  At Troy's table, very little was said \par
during the show.  The threesome pointed out songs they particularly liked \par
(Carol's favorite was the Whitney Houston song, "The Greatest Love of All"), but \par
there was no time for conversation.  Angie dedicated her penultimate song, "Let \par
Me Take Care of You, Baby," to her "dearest friend" (Nick kicked Troy under the \par
table) and then finished with her most popular cut from Love Letters.  The \par
audience gave her a standing ovation and hooted noisily for an encore.  Nick \par
noticed while he was standing that he was a little woozy from the two strong \par
drinks and was also feeling strangely emotional, possibly because of the \par
subliminal associations created by the love songs that Angie was singing.\par
\tab Angie returned to the stage.  As the noise subsided, her soft and \par
caressing voice could be heard.  "You all know that Key West is a very special \par
place for me.  It was here that I was raised and went to school.  Most of my \par
memories bring me back here."  She paused and her eyes scanned the audience.  \par
"There are many songs that bring back memories and the emotions that go with \par
them.  But of all of them, my favorite is the theme song from the musical Cats.  \par
So, Key West, this is for you."\par
\tab There was scattered clapping as the music synthesizers accompanying her \par
played the introduction to "Memories."  The audience remained standing as \par
Angie's mellifluous voice launched into the beautiful song.  As soon as she \par
began, Nick was instantly transported to the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., \par
in June of 1984, where he was watching a production of Cats with his mother and \par
father.  He had finally come home to explain to them why he had been unable to \par
return to Harvard after his spring break in Florida.  But try as he might, he \par
could not begin to tell the story to his disappointed father and brokenhearted \par
mother.  All he could say was, "It was a woman .  .  ."  and then he would fall \par
silent.\par
\tab It had been a sad reunion.  While he was visiting his home in Falls \par
Church, the first malignant polyps had been discovered and removed from his \par
father's colon.  The doctors had been optimistic about several more years of \par
life, but they had stressed that colon cancer often recurred and metastasized to \par
other parts of the body.  In a long talk with his suddenly frail father, Nick \par
had promised to finish his degree in Miami.  But that was little solace to the \par
older man; he had dreamed of seeing his son graduate from Harvard.\par
\tab The performance of Cats at the Kennedy Center had been only mildly \par
entertaining for Nick.  In the middle he had found himself wondering how many \par
people in the audience really knew the author of the source material for the \par
songs, this poet T.S. Eliot, who not only admired and enjoyed feline \par
idiosyncrasies, but also once began a poem by describing the evening "spread out \par
against the sky, like a patient aetherized upon a table."  But when the old \par
female cat walked to center stage, her beauty faded into wrinkles, and began her \par
song of her "days in the sun," Nick had been moved right along with the entire \par
audience.  For reasons he never understood, he had seen Monique singing the \par
song, years in the future.  And in Washington he had wept, silent tears hidden \par
quickly from his parents, when the achingly pure soprano voice had reached the \par
climax of the song..\par
\tab "Touch me .  .  .  It's so easy to leave me .  .  .  all alone with my \par
memories .  .  .  of my days in the sun .  .  .  If you touch me .  .  .  you'll \par
understand what happiness is .  .  ."\par
\tab Angie's voice at Sloppy Joe's was not nearly as piercing as that soprano \par
in Washington But she sang with the same intensity, evoking all the sadness of \par
someone for whom all the joys of life are in the past.  The corners of Nick's \par
eyes filled with tears and one of them brimmed out to run down his cheek.\par
\tab From where Carol was standing, the lights from the stage reflected off \par
Nick's cheek.  She saw the tear, the window of vulnerability, and was herself \par
moved in return.  For the first time she felt a deep stirring, almost an \par
affection for this distant, solitary, but strangely attractive man.\par
\tab Ah Carol, how different it might have been if, for once in your life, you \par
had not acted impulsively.  If you had just let the man have his moment of \par
loneliness or heartbreak or tenderness or whatever he was feeling, then you \par
might have mentioned it later, at a quieter time, to some advantage.  The \par
sharing of this moment might even have eventually been part of the bonding \par
between you.  But you had to tap Nick on the shoulder, before the song was \par
through, before he even realized himself that he was tearful, and break his \par
precious communion with his inner self.  You were an interloper.  Worse, as so \par
often happens, he interpreted your smile as derision, not sympathy, and like a \par
frightened turtle withdrew completely from the evening.  It was guaranteed that \par
he would reject as insincere any subsequent overtures of friendship.\par
\tab Troy missed the interplay between Carol and Nick.  So he was quite \par
surprised, when he turned around and sat down after the final applause, to find \par
Nick's shoulders set in an unmistakable pose of hostility.  "Wasn't she \par
wonderful, angel?"  Troy said to Carol.  "And how about you, Professor?  Was \par
this the first time you heard her sing?"\par
\tab Nick nodded.  "She was great," he said, almost grudgingly.  "And I am \par
thirsty.  Can a man get a drink in this place?"\par
\tab Troy was slightly offended.  "Well, pardon us," he said.  "So sorry that \par
the entertainment lasted so long."  He tried to signal for the waiter.  "What's \par
eating him, angel?" he said conversationally to Carol.\par
\tab Carol shrugged her shoulders.  Then, trying to lighten the atmosphere, she \par
leaned toward Nick and tapped him on the forearm on top of the table.  "Hey, \par
Nick," she said, "have you been taking angry pills?"\par
\tab Nick quickly withdrew his arm and grumbled something inaudible as a reply.  \par
He turned away from the conversation and saw that Angie was approaching the \par
table.  He stood up automatically and both Carol and Troy joined him.  "You were \par
fantastic," said Carol, a little too loud, just as soon as Angie was within \par
earshot.\par
\tab "Thanks .  .  .  Hi," replied Angie, as she walked up to the table and \par
took the chair that Troy had pulled out for her.  She spent a few moments \par
graciously acknowledging the praise from people at the nearby tables.  Then she \par
sat down and smiled.  "You must be Carol Dawson," she said easily, leaning \par
across the table toward the reporter.\par
\tab Angie was even more beautiful in person than she had been in the picture \par
on the disc jacket.  Her coloring was a dark brown, not quite black.  Her \par
makeup, including the light pink lipstick, was muted to permit her natural \par
assets, including virtually perfect white teeth on prominent display when she \par
smiled, to draw the attention.  But beyond the beauty was the woman herself.  No \par
still photograph could do justice to the natural warmth that radiated from \par
Angie.  You liked her immediately.\par
\tab "And you must be Nick Williams," Angie said, extending her hand to Nick.  \par
He was still standing, looking uncomfortable and uncertain, although Troy had \par
already seated himself.  "Troy has told me so many things about you in the past \par
few days, I feel as if we're already friends.  He claims that you've read every \par
novel ever written that's worth reading."\par
\tab "That's an exaggeration, of course," Nick replied, obviously pleased to be \par
recognized.  He seemed to loosen up a little and finally sat down.  He started \par
to add another comment but Carol jumped into the conversation and cut him off.\par
\tab "Did you write that beautiful song about the blind man yourself?" she \par
asked, before Angie had really had time to sit down and collect herself.  "It \par
seemed to be a very personal statement."\par
\tab "Yes," Angie answered Carol pleasantly, without a trace of irritation at \par
Carol's aggressive behavior.  "Most of my material comes from other sources, but \par
occasionally I write a song myself.  When it is a very special subject for me."  \par
She smiled briefly at Troy before continuing.  "My father is a remarkable, \par
loving man, blind from birth but with an uncanny comprehension of the world at \par
all levels.  Without his patience and guidance, I probably would never have had \par
the courage to sing as a little girl.  I was too shy and self-conscious.  But my \par
father convinced all of us when we were small that we were somehow special.  He \par
told us that God had given each of us something unusual, something uniquely \par
ours, and that one of the great joys of life was discovering and then developing \par
that special talent."\par
\tab "And that song, 'Let Me Take Care of You, Baby,' did you really write that \par
for Troy?"  Nick blurted out his question before Angie had finished her \par
sentence.  He thereby destroyed the soft mood created by Angie's loving \par
description of her father.  Nick was on the edge of his chair and for some \par
reason seemed agitated and unsettled.  Troy wondered again what he had missed in \par
the interaction between Carol and Nick that had caused his friend to become so \par
tense.\par
\tab Angie looked at Troy.  "I guess so," she said with a wistful smile, \par
"although it was originally meant to be a playful tune, a light commentary on \par
the game of love."  She stopped for a moment.  "But it does talk about a real \par
problem.  It's very hard sometimes being a successful women.  It interferes \emdash  "\par
\tab "Amen.  Amen," Carol interrupted while Angie was still developing her \par
thought.  This was one of Carol's favorite subjects and she was ready to pounce \par
on the opportunity.  "Most men cannot deal with a woman who is the least bit \par
successful, much less in the spotlight."  She looked directly at Nick and then \par
continued, "Even now, in 1994, there are still unwritten rules that must be \par
followed.  If you want to have a permanent relationship with a man, there are \par
three don'ts:  Don't let him think you're smarter than he is, don't suggest sex \par
first, and, above all, don't make more money than he does.  These are the three \par
key areas where their egos are extremely fragile And if you undermine the ego of \par
any man, even when you're just kidding with him, then it s a lost cause."\par
\tab "Sounds like you're an expert," Nick replied sarcastically.  His hostility \par
was obvious.  "I wonder if it ever occurred to any of you liberated females that \par
men are not put off by your success, but rather by the way you handle it.  What \par
you accomplish in life does not mean shit at the personal level.  Most \par
ambitious, aggressive women I have met (and now he was looking directly at \par
Carol) go out of their way to make male-female relationships into some kind of \par
competition.  They will not let the man, even for a moment, have the illusion \par
that he lives in a patriarchal society.  I think some of them purposely \par
emasculate \emdash  "\par
\tab "There it is," Carol jumped in triumphantly.  She nudged Angie, who was \par
smiling but still a little embarrassed at the rancor in this exchange.  "That's \par
the magic word.  Whenever a woman wants to argue and not accept as gospel some \par
profound male truth, she is trying to 'castrate' or 'emasculate' \emdash  "\par
\tab "Okay, you guys," Troy interjected firmly, shaking his head.  "That's \par
enough.  Let's change the subject.  I had thought that maybe you two could enjoy \par
an evening together, but not if we're going to start this way."\par
\tab "The problem," Carol continued, now looking at Angie and ignoring Troy's \par
request, "is that men are frightened.  Their hegemony in the Western world is \par
threatened by the emergence of women who aren't willing to be just barefoot and \par
pregnant.  Why, when I was at Stanford \emdash  "\par
\tab She stopped and turned when she heard the legs of a chair scraping across \par
the Roor.  "With all due respect, Miss Leatherwood," Nick was standing up again, \par
holding the chair in his hand, "I believe I will excuse myself.  I thoroughly \par
enjoyed your music, but I do not wish to subject you to any more bad manners.  I \par
wish you continued good fortune in your career and I hope that someday you can \par
spend some time on the boat with Troy and me."  Nick turned to Troy.  "I'll see \par
you at the marina at eight o'clock in the morning."  Finally he looked at Carol.  \par
"You, too, if you still want to go.  You can tell us about the wimps at Stanford \par
while we're out in the middle of the Gulf."\par
\tab Nick did not wait for a reply He picked up the envelope and walked back \par
through the crowd toward the exit.  As he was approaching the door he heard a \par
voice calling him, "Nick.  Oh, Nick.  Over here."  It was Julianne, waving to \par
him from a nearby table full of glasses and ashtrays.  She and Corinne and Linda \par
were surrounded by half a dozen men but Julianne was moving them all around and \par
pulling up an empty chair.  Nick walked over to her table.\par
\par
\tab Thirty minutes later Nick was very drunk.  The combination of Julianne's \par
occasionally brushing his leg, Corinne's gigantic breasts (they were covered now \par
but he could remember them from Troy's game in the afternoon), and intermittent \par
glimpses of Carol through the cigarette smoke had made him very horny as well.  \par
God damn it, Williams, he had thought to himself when he first sat down with \par
Julianne's group.  You blew it again.  Here you had this perfect chance to charm \par
her.  Maybe even score.  But half an hour later, after the drinks, his thoughts \par
were more reminiscent of Aesop's fox.  She's too aggressive for me anyway.  \par
Famous.  Pushy.  Probably too hard underneath And cold in bed.  Another \par
ballbuster.  Yet still he watched her from across the room.\par
\tab The extra chairs that had been brought in for Angie's performance were \par
cleared away to make room for dancing.  A disc jockey orchestrated the rest of \par
the evening from a booth next to the stage; one could dance to a variety of \par
modern musical selections, watch the outrageously overproduced music videos on \par
the big screens.  or just talk, for the music was not overwhelmingly loud.  Most \par
of the people around Nick were from the marina.  During a break in the music, \par
just after Nick had downed another fast tequila, Linda Quinlan leaned across the \par
table.  "Come on, Nick," she said, "let us in on your secret.  What did you and \par
Troy find yesterday?"\par
\tab "Nothing special," said Nick, remembering his agreement but surprised to \par
discover that he did indeed want to talk about it.\par
\tab "Rumor says different," jumped in one of the men at the table.  "Everybody \par
knows that you took something to Amanda Winchester this morning.  Come on, tell \par
us what it was.  Have you found a new treasure ship?"\par
\tab "Maybe," said Nick, a drunken grin on his face, "just maybe."  Another \par
strong impulse pushed him to tell the story and show the pictures, but he \par
stopped himself.  "I can't talk about it," was all he would say.\par
\tab At this moment two burly young men, short-haired Navy types wearing \par
officer's uniforms, were making a beeline for Nick's table from the other side \par
of the floor.  One of them was dark, Hispanic.  Their approach was confident, \par
even arrogant, and their arrival at the table stopped all the conversation.  The \par
white lieutenant put his hand on Julianne's shoulder.  "All right, gorgeous," he \par
said boldly, "the Navy is here.  Why don't you and your friend there (he nodded \par
at Corinne \emdash  Ramirez was standing behind her), come and dance with us?"\par
\tab Julianne said, "No, thank you," very politely and smiled.  Todd looked \par
down at her.  He was weaving just a little and it was clear from his eyes that \par
he had been drinking heavily.\par
\tab "You mean to tell me," he said, "that you would prefer to sit here with \par
these local geeks rather than dance with future admirals?"  Julianne felt his \par
hand tighten on her shoulder.  She looked around the table and tried to ignore \par
him.\par
\tab Todd did not like rejection.  He took his hand off Julianne's shoulder and \par
pointed at Corinne's breasts.  "Christ, Ramirez, you were right.  They are \par
monsters.  Wouldn't you like to snarf one of those?"  The two lieutenants \par
laughed crudely.  Corinne squirmed self-consciously.\par
\tab Linda Quinlan's steady boyfriend rose from his chair.  Other than Nick, he \par
was the only one of the men at the table who was approximately the same size as \par
Todd and Ramirez.  "Look, guys," he said reasonably, "the lady said no very \par
nicely.  There is no need to insult her or her friends \emdash  "\par
\tab "Listen to him, Ramirez," Todd interrupted, "this character said we \par
insulted someone.  Since when is admiring the size of someone's cachunga's an \par
insult?"  He chuckled to himself at his cleverness.  Ramirez made a sign to \par
leave but Todd waved him off.\par
\tab The drunken Nick had been ready to explode all night.  "Get out of here, \par
asshole," he said, quietly but firmly.  He was still sitting down next to \par
Julianne.\par
\tab "Who are you calling asshole, cocksucker?" the truculent Lieutenant Todd \par
replied.  He turned to Ramirez.  "I do believe that I am going to be forced to \par
strum the head of this impertinent bastard."\par
\tab But Nick was ahead of him.  Rising swiftly, he uncoiled a vicious punch \par
that struck Todd full in the face and sent him tumbling backwards, into another \par
table covered with drinks.  Todd and the table crashed to the floor and Nick \par
went after him.  Ramirez pulled Nick off his fellow officer and, when Nick \par
turned and swung at him as well, Ramirez gave Nick a push that caused his \par
unsteady legs to give way.  Nick fell back over Julianne and another full table \par
collapsed upon the floor\par
\tab From across the room Carol and Angie and Troy could see the fracas and \par
recognize Nick in the middle of it.  "Uh oh," Troy said, jumping up to go to his \par
friend's aid.  Carol was right behind him.  When they reached the opposite side \par
of the room, both club bouncers were already on top of the action.  Meanwhile, \par
Nick and Julianne were still trying to get unscrambled on the floor and Todd was \par
slowly rising to his feet.\par
\tab In the fight, the envelope of photos had been knocked free and a couple of \par
them had fallen partially out.  Ramirez had picked the envelope up off the floor \par
and, because of the bright colors, was looking at the pictures.  The close-up of \par
the brown missile in the fissure was clearly visible in the top photo.  "Hey," \par
he said to the shaken Todd, "look at this.  What do you think this is all \par
about?"\par
\tab Carol acted instantly.  She walked past Ramirez, grabbed the envelope and \par
pictures, and before he could say anything, she screamed, "Not again, Nick, no, \par
I don't believe it.  How could you be drunk again?"  She knelt down beside Nick \par
on the floor and cradled his head in her free hand.  "Oh, darling," she said, as \par
he stared at her in complete disbelief, "you promised that you'd stop."\par
\tab The astonished crowd watched as Carol kissed Nick full on the mouth to \par
prevent his saying anything.  Troy was amazed.  "Troy," she shouted a moment \par
later, while Nick was trying to gather his wits.  "Troy, where are you?  Here, \par
give me a hand."  Troy rushed up and helped Nick to his feet.  "We're taking him \par
home now," she announced to the onlookers.  She and Troy each took one arm and \par
the three of them stumbled toward the door of the nightclub.  They passed the \par
manager in the doorway.  Carol told him that she would come by the next day to \par
settle accounts.  She and Troy half carried Nick into the street.\par
\tab As they walked away from Sloppy Joe's, Carol turned around and saw that \par
part of the crowd had followed them to the door.  Ramirez and Todd, the latter \par
still rubbing his cheek, were standing in front of the group with puzzled \par
expressions on their faces.  "Where are we taking him, angel?"  Troy asked when \par
they were out of earshot.  "We don't even know where he parked his car.\par
\tab "It doesn't matter," Carol replied, "just as long as we are out of sight \par
of the club."\par
\tab The awkward threesome turned right, down the same alley that ran behind \par
the theater where The Night of the Iguana had finished an hour before.  Just \par
past the theater there was a small vacant lot on the left Carol stopped the trio \par
at the edge of the lot, opposite a grove of trees, and looked back to make \par
certain they were not being followed.  She heaved a sigh and loosened her grip \par
on Nick.  She unconsciously fanned her sweating face with the envelope she had \par
recovered from Ramirez.\par
\tab Nick was now almost coherent.  "I had no idea," he mumbled to Carol, \par
pulling his arm free from Troy and trying to embrace her, "that you felt that \par
way about me."\par
\tab "I don't," Carol said emphatically.  She pushed his arms away and \par
backpedaled toward the vacant lot.  Nick didn't understand and continued his \par
approach.  "Stop," she shouted angrily at him.  "Stop, you drunken bastard."\par
\tab She tried to fend off his advance with her hands.  But he kept coming.  \par
Just before Troy moved up to restrain him, Carol slapped Nick hard in the face \par
with the hand that was not holding the envelope.  Momentarily startled Nick lost \par
his footing and fell into the grass on his stomach.\par
\tab Still fuming, Carol bent down beside him and forcefully rolled him over on \par
his back.  "Don't you ever, ever, use physical force with me," she shouted at \par
Nick.  "Not under any circumstances."  She dropped the envelope on Nick's \par
stomach and stood up quickly.  She looked at Troy, shook her head in disgust, \par
and stalked off down the alley.\par
\par
\par
ASSEMBLY AND TEST\par
\par
UNDER the scanning electron microscope they look like tightly coiled springs \par
with a small tail.  When they are placed in water or some other liquid, the \par
springs seem to stretch out and cilialike appendages extend a few angstroms out \par
from the tail to provide motility.\par
\tab There are millions of them concentrated in a mixture the size of a tiny \par
drop of water and they are being carefully checked by a laser device that is \par
also counting and sorting them as it illuminates microscopic portions of the \par
mixture.  When the count is completed, the smaller division of the separated \par
mixture is sluiced out of the metal receptacle and down a channel into another \par
liquid, this one emerald green in color, that is contained in a bottle-shaped \par
beaker.  The springs spread out and follow random paths in wandering around the \par
beaker.\par
\tab External mechanisms regularly churn the emerald green liquid.  Around the \par
inside of the beaker, tiny sensors register the temperature, pressure, and exact \par
chemical and electrical characteristics of the fluid.  Some parameter is not \par
absolutely perfect.  A small valve opens a port in the base of the beaker and a \par
new chemical is injected into the green solution.  Continuous measurements \par
monitor the diffusion of this additional material.  At length the fluid is \par
properly altered and a new equilibrium is reached.\par
\tab Everything is now ready.  From above several thousand small pellets are \par
dropped into the container.  Some of these pellets float on the surface but most \par
sink to variable depths in the liquid.  Embedded in each of the pellets is a \par
complicated engineering construction on an amazingly miniaturized scale.  The \par
external surface of the pellets contains sensors that scan the nearby region of \par
the liquid for the springlike objects.  A high-frequency transmitter housed next \par
to the sensors directs a call to the springs and attracts them to the \par
neighborhood.  Clusters of springs develop around each pellet.\par
\tab Now, one at a time, these springs are harvested by small instruments \par
inside the spongy outer section of the pellet and then loaded in carriers that \par
are electrically fired toward the central cavity of the pellet.  Within that \par
cavity sits a single black, amorphous spot, its exterior constantly changing \par
shape as its opaque material shifts around to follow unknown stimuli.  This spot \par
is surrounded by a yellow goo that fills the remainder of the cavity.\par
\tab The first spring slips out of its carrier, then locates and penetrates the \par
spot.  The spring can be seen for an instant moving toward the center.  However, \par
it is broken up and destroyed within milliseconds.  Other springs are fired into \par
the cavity at regular intervals and all try, after penetration, to reach some \par
special region in the spot.  Finally one of the procession succeeds and the spot \par
changes color to bright red.  In rapid succession, some enzyme in the spongy \par
outer section of the pellet is dumped into the yellow goo, turning its color a \par
little toward green, and all the rest of the springs disappear, apparently \par
absorbed by the pellet structure.  The entire pellet itself next elongates and \par
extends a miniature propulsion system into the emerald liquid.  After carefully \par
steering around the many hazards, it then joins the queue of fertilized pellets \par
moving, one by one, through a round diaphanous membrane in the bottom of the \par
beaker.\par
\tab The fluid dense with pellets speeds along a narrow tube until it reaches a \par
partially closed container approximately the size of the beaker.  Inside this \par
translucent jar, a mechanical, spoonlike object digs into the stream of liquid \par
flowing through and plucks out the pellets.  They are lifted up and then \par
suspended momentarily around the passing fluid in a heavy gas enclosed by the \par
jar.  Within moments each of the pellets splits and their carapaces apparently \par
dissolve, leaving visible inside the jar an array of the little red spots \par
surrounded by the off-yellow goo and suspended in an invisible gas.\par
\tab The goo extends itself slowly throughout the jar above the flowing fluid \par
until all the open areas between the red spots are filled.  When the emerald \par
stream below drops to a trickle and then disappears altogether, the goo hardens \par
into a gelatin and fills the ports where the fluid once entered and departed.  \par
Within the jar are several thousand red spots embedded in the yellow-green \par
gelatin.  The spots undergo no visible change throughout this process.\par
\tab Time passes.  Activity in the jar ceases.  Occasionally mechanical probes \par
to test the stability of the gelatin are inserted into the jar at the old fluid \par
ports.  At last the translucent jar is removed from its storage location by what \par
looks like a robotic forklift.  It is placed on a moving belt that now carries \par
it, along with several dozen other jars containing different kinds of objects \par
(blue pencils, purple stars, and red boxes can all be seen) also suspended in \par
yellow-green gelatin, to a vast circular oven almost an inch in diameter.  Here \par
all the jars are carefully baked together.  Inside the oven, the molecules of \par
the jar material immediately evaporate.  Next a pair of disembodied manipulator \par
hands wrap an incredibly thin blanket of connective filaments around all the \par
gelatinous structures.  After some time this ensemble unit is then pulled \par
automatically out of the oven and packaged inside a gold metallic envelope whose \par
several layers are designed to provide all the remaining environmental \par
protection.\par
\par
\tab The hypergolic propellants mix and burst instantly into flame, pouring \par
fire out the rocket nozzle.  The slender vehicle rises, slowly at first, but \par
later with astonishing speed.  Before reaching the zenith of its flight, the \par
rocket stage underneath the strange paraboloid payload falls away and tiny \par
motors ignite on the underside of the flying boomerang.  At the apex of the \par
trajectory, the entire package suddenly explodes and apparently disintegrates.  \par
Hundreds of pieces of the original payload fall toward the surface of the planet \par
in seemingly random directions.\par
\tab Closer inspection reveals that each individual piece resulting from the \par
explosion is made of a gold metallic material encased in plastic.  A small \par
sensor/propulsion package is attached to the plastic; it supplies needed vernier \par
corrections during the descent after the controlled explosion.  The plastic \par
debris falls upon a strange, hybrid planet, obviously artificial judging by the \par
wide variety of incongruous surfaces and cloud groupings that can be recognized \par
from an altitude of tens of miles.  There are scattered liquid lakes of \par
different hues plus discontinuous surface topography with regions of desert and \par
grasslands as well as barren mountains and canyons.  A connected quarter of the \par
planet is covered with clouds .  The clouds are here white and fleecy, there \par
brown and thick.  Some of the clouds are active, building and changing with \par
hints of turbulence.  Other parts of the cloudy region are static, small wisps \par
of white stretching without change across the sky.\par
\tab One of the plastic vehicles plunges through a misty blue cloudbank into an \par
emerald sea.  The plastic is left on the surface, but the encased gold metallic \par
object sinks thirty feet to the floor of the ocean.  For a day or two there is \par
no discernible change in its appearance.  Then a protrusion begins to form in \par
its north polar region, on the top of the golden sphere as it sits on the ocean \par
floor.  The growth expands slowly, until the spherical shape appears to have a \par
large carbuncle on its top.  A metamorphosis now takes place.  On the outside of \par
the protrusion, the hard metal surface softens and begins to resemble an organic \par
membrane.  Although the membrane is thick and dense, it occasionally bulges, \par
suggesting some motion on the other side of its golden barrier.\par
\tab Eventually a thin black rod, a probe of some kind, thrusts through the \par
surface into the emerald ocean.  A second probe becomes visible, then a third, \par
both long black rods like the first one, but each equipped with strikingly \par
different apparatus scattered along the length of the rod.  Something larger \par
pushes against the membrane, once, twice, then finally breaking through.  What a \par
strange contraption!  It's an aerodynamic shape about three inches long, in two \par
separate segments with a joint between them.  The forebody is a nosecone; the \par
afterbody is long and slender and tapers to a point.  In addition to the three \par
probes on the front of its forebody, it has four other furlable appendages or \par
arms, two connected to the side of each segment.\par
\tab It swims over to a nearby underwater plant with its arms stored next to \par
its smooth body.  There it unfurls the multi-faceted appendages and begins to \par
examine the plant.  An astonishing array of tiny instruments studies the plant \par
for a few moments and then the entity moves away.  The same procedure is \par
repeated with each plant encountered.  Eventually the thing finds a plant that \par
it "likes" and its pincers remove a -major leaf.  The leaf is neatly folded into \par
a smaller volume and is then carried back to the object with the golden \par
membrane.\par
\tab The strange forager is joined by a partner, a carbon copy of itself, and \par
by two fat fish with multiple arms and legs.  The latter pair scuttle off to the \par
side and begin modifying the ocean floor.  Days pass.  The things with the \par
probes work ceaselessly, bringing more and more varieties of plant and animal \par
life back to the home base.  The legged fish meanwhile have constructed, out of \par
available sand, rocks, shells, and living creatures, almost a thousand tiny, \par
sealed rectangular homes on the ocean floor.  These fish entities too work \par
without break.  Their next task is to transport each of the red spots, one at a \par
time, from the golden cradle to their new houses.\par
\tab If a microscope were available, it would show that some structure was \par
already developing inside the red spots, giving them definition and distinction, \par
by the time of their initial transport.  But they are still very, very small.  \par
Once the red spots and their gelatin protection are carefully implanted inside \par
their tiny houses, the foragers make routine stops on each trip to deposit a \par
portion of their harvest.  At the same time, the fish with legs, the architects \par
and builders of the rectangular houses, begin working on transparent, igloolike \par
homes for the embryos of another species.\par
\par
\tab A year later moonlight falls on the emerald lake.  Several hundred eager, \par
excited, wriggling necks, some royal blue and some pale blue, struggle upward to \par
find the moon.  Their heads pivot to face all directions and maybe two dozen \par
separate indentations and orifices can be seen in each face.  The necks crane \par
this way, then that way.  The silent serpents are searching for something.\par
\tab From the direction of the moon a bizarre ship approaches on the water.  It \par
is large compared to the young serpents, its twin towers standing about eight \par
feet out of the water and about six feet above, on the average, a squarish \par
platform fifteen feet on a side that forms the bottom of the boat.  The top \par
surface of this platform is irregular, undulating, and cratered.  The platform \par
floats smoothly upon the water.\par
\tab The ship comes into the middle of the serpents and stops.  The serpents \par
divide into two groups according to the color of their necks and then line up on \par
either side of the ship in very orderly rows and columns.  A single musical \par
note, a B-flat with a Hautish timbre, comes from the ship.  Quickly the note is \par
repeated up and down the rows and columns by each of the serpents on the two \par
sides of the boat.  Then a second note issues forth from the ship, also sounding \par
like a flute, and the process repeats itself.  For hours the music lesson \par
continues, covering a range of both notes and chords, until some of the serpents \par
on each side lose their voices The exercise concludes with an attempted ensemble \par
performance by the royal bluenecked serpents, but the result is a painful \par
cacophony.\par
\tab Inside the ship, every note, every movement, every response by the \par
juvenile serpents to the music lesson is carefully monitored and recorded.  The \par
ingenious engineering design of the boat is based upon the key controlling \par
elements of the original cradle.  However, although segments of gold metallic \par
material (as well as the long black rods and even portions of the fat fish with \par
legs) appear in the computer that runs the ship, the primary constituents of its \par
mass are derived from great quantities of local rock and organic matter taken \par
from the floor of the emerald lake.  The ship is the quintessential music \par
teacher, a virtually perfect synthesizer equipped with microprocessors that not \par
only store all the responses of the pupils, but also contain software that will \par
allow experimentation with a range of individualized methods of teaching.\par
\tab But this sophisticated robot, engineered by the artificial .intelligence \par
packed around the serpent zygotes and made almost entirely of chemical compounds \par
extracted from material found in the neighborhood of the landing point, is \par
itself being watched and studied from afar by test engineers.  The current test \par
is in its earliest stages and is progressing splendidly.  This is the third \par
different configuration tried for the music teacher, the hardest part of the \par
design of the cradle that will carry the serpent zygotes back to Canthor.  The \par
first was an abysmal failure; the embryos developed into adolescents all right, \par
but the teacher was never able to instruct them well enough that they could sing \par
the mating song and reproduce.  The second design was better; it was able to \par
teach the serpents to perform the courtship symphony and a new generation of the \par
species was produced.  However, this next group of adult serpents was not able \par
subsequently to teach their progeny to sing.\par
\tab The best of the bioengineering personnel in the Colony were brought in to \par
study this problem.  After pouring over quadrillions of bits of accumulated data \par
associated with the development of the serpents and other related species, they \par
found a curious correlation between the degree of nurturing provided by the \par
parent and the resulting ability of that infant, upon reaching maturity, to \par
teach its own offspring.  The artificial intelligence package responsible for \par
the first six months of serpent life was then redesigned to include a surrogate \par
mother whose only purpose was to hold and cuddle the fledgling serpents at \par
regular intervals.  Subsystem tests proved successful; this slight alteration of \par
the early nurturing protocol produced adult serpents that were able to teach \par
their children to sing\par
\tab This demonstration test lasts for more than four millcycles.  At the end \par
of the period, the test is declared an unqualified success.  A strong, creative \par
serpent population nearing twenty-five thousand fills the artificial lake.  \par
Limitations to future growth are only test related.  Eventually the test \par
survivors are transported to another locale in the Zoo Complex and the \par
Canthorean serpents are added to the list of species ready for zygote \par
repatriation.\par

SATURDAY\par

\par
THE full moon rises over the placid ocean.  Troy stares at the moonbeams, \par
watching them shimmer on the quiet water.  Angie appears and stands in the water \par
in front of him.  She is wearing a skintight white bathing suit, one piece, and \par
is submerged from the waist down.\par
\tab She beckons to him and he walks across the damp sand toward the water.  He \par
is barefoot and is also wearing a white bathing suit.  The water is surprisingly \par
warm.  Angie begins to sing.  Her magnificent voice enfolds him as Troy draws \par
nearer to her in the light surf.\par
\tab They touch and kiss.  She pulls away and gives him a smile of \par
encouragement.  Troy feels himself becoming aroused.  Suddenly a siren pierces \par
the air, destroying the calm of the night.  Instantly the sea becomes choppy, \par
agitated, full of whitecaps.  Troy turns around, alarmed, and glances at the \par
shore.  He sees nothing special.  He looks back at the ocean.  Angie has \par
disappeared.  Out in the distance, near the horizon, Troy thinks he sees the \par
beginning of a tidal wave.  The siren shrieks again and Troy sees a large \par
shapeless mass riding a nearby wave in the moonlight.\par
\tab He goes toward the object.  The tidal wave is now defined in the distance, \par
filling half his dream screen.  The bulky object nearby is a black body dressed \par
in a red muscle shirt and bluejeans.  The siren grows louder.  Troy rolls the \par
body over and looks at the face.  It is his brother, Jamie.\par
\par
\tab Troy Jefferson bolted upright in bed.  his heart pounding furiously, his \par
mind making the transition from the dream world to reality.  Outside his duplex \par
apartment a siren raged.  He could tell from the frequency change that the \par
police car or ambulance had just sped past his front door.  He shook himself and \par
crawled out of bed.  The digital clock on the end table read 3:03.\par
\tab Troy walked to the kitchen.  He went to the refrigerator and poured \par
himself a glass of grapefruit juice.  He listened to the siren in the distance \par
until it faded away altogether.  Then he started back to the small second \par
bedroom where he slept.  In the hallway he was stopped by the sound of another \par
siren, this one even louder, that seemed to be coming toward him.  For a few \par
seconds he thought the siren was just outside his front door and he recalled, \par
vividly, another siren in the middle of another night.  His heart began to pound \par
anew.  "Jamie," Troy said to himself almost involuntarily, "Jamie.  Why did you \par
have to die?"\par
\tab Troy could still see the events of that evening with perfect clarity.  \par
Nothing in the first tableau had faded even a little.  The beginning memory was \par
the three of them, Jamie, Troy, and their mother, sitting silently at the dinner \par
table, eating fried chicken and mashed potatoes.  Jamie had just arrived home \par
from Gainesville for spring break that afternoon and had spent almost an hour, \par
before they had sat down to eat, regaling his fifteen-year-old brother with \par
stories of football and university life.  Jamie had been Troy's idol throughout \par
his childhood.  Handsome, intelligent, and articulate, Jamie had also been \par
blessed with incredible physical gifts.  As a result, he had been the starting \par
halfback for the Florida Gators in his sophomore year and was being touted as a \par
potential All-American for the following season.  Troy had bitterly missed Jamie \par
when he had first gone away to the university, but in the intervening eighteen \par
months he had learned to accept his absence and to look forward to his brother's \par
holiday visits.\par
\tab "So, bro," Jamie had said with a smile, when he finished his dinner and \par
pushed his plate away, "what about you?  You've finished another quarter \par
already.  Did you make the grades of a future astronaut?"\par
\tab "I did okay," Troy had replied, hiding his pride.  "I made a B plus in \par
Social Studies because my teacher thought I had taken an anti-American position \par
in my paper on the Panama Canal."\par
\tab "I guess an occasional B plus is acceptable," Jamie had laughed, his \par
affection for his younger brother clearly showing.  "But I bet Burford didn't \par
make many B's when he was in the ninth grade."\par
\tab Whenever Troy recalled the fateful evening that his brother was killed, he \par
always remembered the mention of Guion Burford, the first American black \par
astronaut.  Most of the time his memory, because it was so painful to proceed \par
immediately to the terrible recollection of his dying brother in his arms, would \par
choose to digress to a happier time, to a remembrance of his brother Jamie that \par
was almost as vivid as the death scene, but was happy and reinforcing instead of \par
being gut wrenching and depressing.\par
\tab During the summer before his death, on a hot, humid day in late August, \par
Jamie Jefferson had arranged a third personal meeting with his football coach at \par
Florida to request permission to skip practice for two days.  He wanted to take \par
his little brother, Troy, to see the launch of the space shuttle.  In the first \par
two meetings, the coach had vigorously opposed Jamie's taking the time away from \par
the important workouts, but he had stopped short of denying the request.\par
\tab "You still don't understand, coach," Jamie had said firmly at the start of \par
their third and final meeting on the subject.  "My little brother has no father.  \par
And he's a genius at math and science.  He blows the top off those standardized \par
aptitude tests.  He needs a role model.  He needs to know that blacks can do \par
something significant other than sports."  The coach had eventually relented and \par
given Jamie permission, but only because he had figured out that Jamie was going \par
to go under any circumstances.\par
\tab Jamie had driven his battered Chevrolet nonstop across Florida, picked up \par
his brother in Miami, and continued northward without sleeping for another four \par
hours to Cocoa Beach.  They had arrived in the middle of the night.  Jamie, by \par
now exhausted, parked the car in a beach access zone next to a seven-story \par
condominium along the nicest part of the beach.  "All right, little brother."  \par
he had said, "now get some sleep."\par
\tab But Troy had not been able to sleep.  He had been too excited thinking \par
about the launch scheduled the next evening, the eighth shuttle launch in all, \par
the first one that had ever occurred at night.  He had been reading everything \par
he could find about astronaut Burford and the plans for the mission.  He kept \par
imagining that it was the future and that he, Troy Jefferson, was an astronaut \par
about to be launched into space.  After all, Burford was living proof that it \par
could indeed be done, that a black American could attain the upper echelons of \par
society and become a popular hero on the basis of his intelligence, personality, \par
and hard work.\par
\tab At sunrise Troy had crawled out of the car and walked the few yards to the \par
beach.  It was very quiet.  Troy's company was limited to a few walkers and \par
joggers plus a couple of those bizarre sand crabs, whose eyes wavered back and \par
forth at the end of peculiar stalks as they raced sideways into their holes in \par
the sand.  To the north Troy could see some of the launch pads for the unmanned \par
rockets at Cape Canaveral Air Force Base, but in his mind's eye he saw them as \par
the launching apparatus for the shuttle.  He wondered what astronaut Burford was \par
doing at that very moment.  What was he eating for breakfast?  Was he with his \par
family or with the astronaut crew?\par
\tab Jamie had awakened around noon and the brothers had spent the early \par
afternoon on the beach together, laughing and playing in the surf.  Then they \par
picked up some hamburgers and drove the final half hour to the Kennedy Space \par
Center.  Jamie had strongarmed an avid Gator booster, an aerospace executive who \par
lived in Melbourne, for tickets to the VIP viewing area.  They arrived there \par
just before nightfall.  Four miles away, the impressive shuttle launch \par
configuration.  consisting of the orbiter mounted on top of an orange external \par
tank with two solid rocket boosters on the side, stood erect against its \par
launching tower as the final countdown began.\par
\tab No observing experience in Troy's life would ever come close to rivaling \par
his watching the space shuttle blast off that night.  As he listened to the \par
countdown being announced over the loudspeakers in the VIP area, he was eager \par
and anticipant, but not yet in awe.  The moment the engines ignited, however, \par
filling the Florida night with reddish-orange flame and thick white clouds of \par
billowing smoke, Troy's eyes nearly popped out of his head.  But it was the \par
combination of his seeing the giant spaceship, slowly and majestically lifting \par
itself into the heavens riding a long slender flame, and his hearing the \par
astonishing sound, a constant roar punctuated with unexplained pops (which at \par
only four miles away still arrived twenty or so seconds behind the sight of the \par
engine ignition), that really caused the goose bumps to break out on his skin, \par
the tears to come to his eyes, and the tingle to spread through his body.  \par
Troy's intense emotional excitement lasted well over a minute.  He stood beside \par
his brother Jamie, tightly holding his hand, his back arched as he strained to \par
follow the flame rising higher and higher and then finally disappearing in the \par
night sky above him.\par
\tab After the launch they slept again in the car.  Jamie then dropped Troy at \par
the bus station in Orlando and headed back to Gainesville for football practice.  \par
Young Troy felt that he was a new person, that he had been transformed by his \par
experience.  In the week that followed he obsessively followed the flight.  \par
Burford became his hero, his new idol.  During the first two quarters of the \par
following year, he applied himself avidly to his schoolwork.  He had a goal.  He \par
was going to be an astronaut.\par
\tab Little did Troy know that on a March night only seven months later he \par
would have another experience, this one devastating and deeply disturbing, that \par
would completely overshadow the thrill he had felt at the shuttle launch.  On \par
that later March evening, his brother Jamie would stop by his room before \par
leaving the house around eight o'clock.  "I'm going over to Maria's, bro," Jamie \par
would say.  "We'll probably take in a movie."\par
\tab Maria Alvarez was eighteen and still a senior in high school.  She had \par
been Jamie's steady girl for a couple of years.  She lived in Little Havana \par
together with her Cuban family and eight siblings.\par
\tab Troy had given his brother a hug.  "I'm glad you're here, Jamie.  There \par
are so many things that I want to show you.  I made you a set of headphones in \par
school \emdash  "\par
\tab "I want to see everything."  his brother had interrupted him.  "But \par
tomorrow, first thing in the morning.  Now don't stay up too late.  Astronauts \par
need plenty of sleep so they can be alert."  Jamie had smiled and walked out of \par
Troy's room.  It was the last thing Troy would ever hear him say.\par
\tab Troy never could remember what he had heard first when he had awakened in \par
the middle of that night.  His mother's wild wail had mixed with the screech of \par
the nearby sirens to create an imbroglio of sound that was unforgettable and \par
terrifying.  Troy had raced to the door and into the front yard wearing only his \par
pajama bottoms.  The sound of the ambulance siren was drawing closer.  His \par
mother was at the end of the short walkway in front of the house, bending down \par
over a dark body spread partly in the street in front of Jamie's Chevrolet and \par
partly in their yard.  Three policemen and half a dozen curious bystanders were \par
huddled around his distraught mother.\par
\tab "Somehow," he heard one of the policemen say as Troy, in a panic, tried to \par
figure out what was happening, "he managed to drive home.  It's incredible after \par
all the blood he lost.  He must have been hit four times in the stomach .  .  ."\par
\tab His mother's cry intensified again and, at that moment, Troy put all the \par
pieces together and recognized the body lying on its back.  A chill went through \par
him, he gasped, and then Troy fell on his knees beside his brother's head.  \par
Jamie was struggling for breath.  His eyes were open but they did not seem to be \par
focusing on anything.\par
\tab Troy cradled Jamie's head in his hands.  He looked down at his brother's \par
stomach.  His red shirt was awash in blood that seemed to be flowing in a \par
continuous stream from an area just above the genitals.  Blood was on Jamie's \par
jeans, on the ground, everywhere.  Troy felt himself gag, then retch \par
involuntarily.  Nothing came up.  Hot tears filled his eyes.\par
\tab "We think it was a gang shooting, Mrs. Jefferson," the policeman droned \par
on.  "Probably some kind of a mistake.  Everybody knows that Jamie wasn't mixed \par
up with that kind of crowd."  Reporters had arrived.  Lights were flashing from \par
cameras.  More sirens approached.\par
\tab Jamie's eyes went blank.  There was no sign of breathing.  Troy pulled his \par
brother's head to his chest.  He instinctively knew that Jamie was dead.  He \par
began to sob uncontrollably.  "No," he mumbled.  "No.  Not my brother.  Not \par
Jamie.  He never hurt anybody."\par
\tab Someone tried to comfort him, to pat him on the shoulder Troy shrugged \par
them off violently "Leave me alone," he shouted between sobs.  "He was my \par
brother.  He was my only brother."  After a couple of moments, Troy tenderly \par
placed Jamie's head back down on the ground.  He then collapsed in total despair \par
beside him.\par
\tab At almost three-thirty in the morning some ten years later, in March of \par
1994, Troy Jefferson would be at home, alone in his duplex, awake with the \par
memory of that terrible moment when Jamie had died.  He would feel a new the \par
heartbreak of that loss.  And he would realize again, very clearly, that most of \par
his adolescent dreams had died with his brother, that he had forsaken his dreams \par
of college and being an astronaut because they were inextricably coupled with \par
his memory of Jamie.\par
\tab Somehow he had stumbled through high school in the three years that had \par
followed Jamie's death.  But it had taken the combined efforts of his mother and \par
the school and the city authorities to keep Troy from abandoning school \par
altogether.  Then, as soon as he had graduated, he had left Miami.  Or rather, \par
ran away.  Away from what had happened and what might have been.  For over two \par
years he then wandered in a desultory manner throughout North America, a young, \par
solitary black man, bereft of love and friendship, looking for something to \par
overcome the feeling of emptiness that was his constant companion.\par
\tab So I finally came to Key West, Troy would think, years later, as he \par
settled back in his bed in the middle of the morning for a couple more hours of \par
sleep.  And for some reason made myself a home.  Maybe it was just time.  Or \par
maybe I had learned enough to know that life goes on.  But somehow, although the \par
wound has never healed, I got past Jamie.  And found the lost Troy.  Or so I \par
hope.\par
\tab The dream that had been interrupted by the siren suddenly came back into \par
his mind.  Angie was beautiful in the moonlight in her white bathing suit.  And \par
now for some unfinished business, Troy laughed to himself, concentrating on the \par
image of Angie as he returned to sleep.\par

"GOOD morning, angel," Troy said with a grand smile as Carol approached the \par
Florida Queen.  "Ready to do some fishing?"  He hopped out of the boat and \par
shouted at Nick, who was around at the back on the other side of the canopy.  \par
"She's here, Professor," he hollered  "I'm going out to the parking lot to get \par
her stuff."  Carol gave Troy the keys to her car and he took off in the \par
direction of the marina office.\par
\tab Carol paced for a few moments on the jetty before Nick emerged from behind \par
the canopy.  "Come on down on the boat," he said, scowling a little as he wiped \par
some heavy dredging chain with a dark cloth.  Nick felt terrible.  He had a \par
nasty hangover.  And he was still bothered by the events of the night before \par
Carol didn't say anything at first.  Nick stopped cleaning the chain and waited \par
for her to speak.\par
\tab "I don't know exactly how to say this," she began in a firm but pleasant \par
voice, "but it's important to me that I say it before I get on the boat."  Carol \par
cleared her throat.  "Nick," she said deliberately, "I don't want to dive with \par
you today.  I want to dive with Troy."\par
\tab Nick gave her a quizzical look.  He was standing in the sun and his head \par
was aching.  "But Troy \emdash  " he began.\par
\tab "I know what you're going to say," she interrupted him.  "He doesn't have \par
much experience and it could be a dangerous dive."  She stared directly at Nick.  \par
"That doesn't matter to me.  I have enough diving experience for both of us.  I \par
prefer to dive with Troy."  She waited a few seconds.  "Now if you're not \par
willing \emdash  "\par
\tab This time it was Nick who interrupted Carol.  "All right, all right," he \par
said, turning away.  He was surprised to find that he was both hurt and angry.  \par
This woman is still pissed, he said to himself.  And I thought maybe .  .  .  \par
Nick walked away from Carol and went back on the other side of the canopy to \par
finish preparing the small rented salvage crane he and Troy had installed the \par
night before.  Since they had used this old equipment several times on other \par
excursions, the installation had been straight forward and without major \par
problems.\par
\tab Carol climbed onto the boat and put her copy of the photos on top of the \par
counter next to the steering wheel.  "Where's the trident?" she called to Nick.  \par
"I thought I'd take another look at it this morning."\par
\tab "Bottom left drawer, under the nav equipment," was his swift and sharp \par
reply.  She took the gray bag out of the drawer, opened it, and pulled out the \par
golden trident.  She held it by the long middle rod.  It felt funny for some \par
reason.  Carol put the object back in the bag and pulled it out a second time.  \par
Again she held the heavy trident in her hands.  It still didn't feel right.  \par
Carol remembered grasping the rod underneath the overhang in the water and \par
wrapping her hand slowly around the central rod.  That's it, she said to \par
herself.  It's thicker.\par
\tab She turned the object over in her hands.  What's the matter with me? she \par
thought.  Have I lost my mind?  How could it he thicker?  She examined it one \par
more time with great care.  This time she thought that the individual tines of \par
the fork had lengthened and that she could detect a perceptible increase in the \par
overall weight.  Good grief.  Can this be possible? she wondered.\par
\tab Carol pulled out the photos she had brought along.  All the images of the \par
trident that she had with her had been taken underwater.  But she was certain \par
that she could discern two subtle changes since it was first photographed.  The \par
axis rod did appear to be thicker and the tines of the fork did indeed look \par
longer.\par
\tab "Nick," she said in a loud voice.  "Nick, can you come here?"\par
\tab "I'm right in the middle of something," an unfriendly voice responded from \par
the other side of the canopy.  "Is it important?"\par
\tab "No.  I mean yes," Carol answered.  "But it can wait until your first \par
available moment."\par
\tab Carol's mind was racing.  There are only two possibilities, she said to \par
herself with logical precision, either it has changed or it hasn't.  If it \par
hasn't changed, then I must be spooked.  For it definitely seems thicker.  But \par
how could it change?  Either on its own or someone changed it.  But who?  Nick? \par
But how could he .  .  .  ?\par
\tab Nick came up to her.  "Yes?" he said in a distant, almost hostile tone.  \par
He was obviously annoyed.\par
\tab Carol handed him the trident.  "Well?" she said, smiling and looking at \par
him expectantly.\par
\tab "Well, what?" he answered, totally confused by what was happening and \par
still angry about the earlier interaction.\par
\tab "Can you tell the difference?"  Carol continued, nodding at the trident in \par
his hand.\par
\tab Nick turned it upside down as she had done.  The sunlight glinted off the \par
golden surface and hurt his eyes.  He squinted.  Then he switched the object \par
from hand to hand and looked at it from many different angles.  "I think I'm \par
lost," Nick said at length.  "Are you trying to tell me that there's some change \par
in this thing?"\par
\tab He held it out between them.  "Yes," she said.  "Can't you feel it?  The \par
central rod's thicker than it was on Thursday and the tines or individual \par
elements of that fork on one end are a little longer.  And don't you think the \par
whole thing is heavier?"\par
\tab Nick's headache continued to throb.  He looked back and forth between the \par
trident and Carol.  As far as he could tell, the object had not changed.  "No, I \par
don't," he said.  "It seems the same to me."\par
\tab "You're just being difficult," Carol persisted, grabbing the trident back.  \par
"Here, look at the pictures.  Check out the length of the fork there compared to \par
the overall rod and then look at it now.  It's different."\par
\tab There was something in Carol's general attitude that really irritated \par
Nick.  She always seemed to assume that she was right and everyone else was \par
wrong.  "This is absurd," Nick nearly shouted in reply, "and I have a lot of \par
work to do."  He paused for a moment and then continued.  "How the hell could it \par
change?  It's a metal object, for Christ's sake.  What do you think?  That \par
somehow it grew?  Shit."\par
\tab He shook his head and started to walk away.  After a couple of steps, he \par
turned around.  "You can't trust the pictures anyway, " he said in more measured \par
tones .  "Underwater photos always distort the objects .  .  ."\par
\tab Troy was approaching with both the cart and Carol's equipment.  He could \par
tell from the body positions, even without hearing the words, that his two \par
boatmates were at it again.  "My, my," he said as he walked up, "I can't leave \par
you two alone for a minute.  What are you fighting about this morning, \par
Professor?"\par
\tab "This supposedly intelligent reporter friend of yours," Nick replied, \par
looking at Carol and speaking in a patronizing manner, "insists that our trident \par
has changed shape.  Overnight I guess.  Although she has not yet begun to \par
explain how.  Will you please, since she won't believe me, explain to her about \par
the index of refraction or whatever it is that fouls up underwater pictures."\par
\tab Carol appealed to Troy.  "But it has changed.  Honest.  I remember clearly \par
what it felt like at first and now it feels different."\par
\tab Troy was unloading the cart and putting the ocean telescope system on the \par
Florida Queen.  "Angel," Troy said, stopping to check the trident that she was \par
extending toward him with both hands, "I can't tell whether it has changed or \par
not, but I can tell you one thing.  You were very excited when you found it the \par
first time and you were also underwater.  With that combination I wouldn't trust \par
my own memory of how something felt."\par
\tab Carol looked at the two men.  She was going to pursue the discussion but \par
Nick abruptly changed the subject.  "Did you know, Mr. Jefferson, that our \par
client Miss Dawson has requested your services as a diving partner today?  She \par
doesn't want to dive with me."  His tone was now acerbic.\par
\tab Troy looked at Carol with surprise.  "That's real nice, angel," he said \par
quietly, "but Nick is really the expert.  I'm just a little more than a \par
beginner."\par
\tab "I know that," Carol responded brusquely, still chafing from the outcome \par
of the previous conversation.  "But I want to dive with someone I can trust.  \par
Someone who behaves responsibly.  I know enough about diving for both of us."\par
\tab Nick gave Carol an angry look and then turned and walked away.  He was \par
pissed.  "Come on, Jefferson," he said.  "I've already agreed to let Miss High \par
and Mighty have her way.  This time.  Let's get the boat ready and finish \par
setting up that telescope thing of hers again."\par
\par
\tab "My father finally divorced my mother when I was ten," Carol was saying to \par
Troy.  They were sitting together in the deck chairs at the front of the boat.  \par
After they had gone over the procedures for the dive a couple of times, Carol \par
had mentioned something about her first boating experience, a birthday on a \par
fishing boat with her father when she was six, and the two of them had moved \par
comfortably into a discussion of their childhood.  "The breakup was awful."  She \par
handed the can of Coke back to Troy.  "I think you might have been luckier, in \par
some ways, never to have known your father."\par
\tab "I doubt it," Troy replied seriously.  "From my earliest days, I resented \par
the fact that some of the kids had two parents.  My brother, Jamie, tried to \par
help, of course, but there was only so much he could do.  I purposely chose \par
friends who had fathers living at home."  He laughed.  "I remember one dark \par
black kid named Willie Adams.  His dad was at home all right, but he was an \par
embarrassment to the family.  He was an older man, nearing sixty at the time, \par
and he didn't work.  He just sat on the front porch in his rocking chair all day \par
and drank beer.\par
\tab "Whenever I went over to Willie's house to play, I would always find some \par
excuse to spend a little time on the porch sitting next to Mr. Adams.  Willie \par
would fidget uncomfortably, unable to understand why I wanted to listen to his \par
father tell his old, supposedly boring stories.  Mr. Adams had been in the \par
Korean War and he loved to tell about his friends and the battles and, \par
particularly, the Korean women and what he called their tricks.\par
\tab "Anyway, you could always tell when Mr. Adams was about to start one of \par
his stories.  His eyes would begin to stare in front of him, as if he were \par
looking intently at something far off in the distance, and he would say, as much \par
to himself as anybody, 'Tell the truth, Baby Ruth.' Then he would recite the \par
story, almost as if he were quoting from a written book, 'We had driven the \par
North Koreans back to the Yalu and our battalion commander told us they were \par
ready to surrender,' he would say.  "We were feeling good, talking about what we \par
were all going to do when we got back to the States.  But then the great yellow \par
horde poured out of China .  .  .' "\par
\tab Troy stopped.  He stared out at the ocean.  It was easy for Carol to see \par
him as a young boy, sitting on a porch with his embarrassed friend Willie and \par
listening to stories told by a man who lived hopelessly in the past but who, \par
nevertheless, represented the father that Troy had never had.  She leaned over \par
to Troy and touched his forearm.  "It makes a pretty picture," she said.  "You \par
probably never knew how happy you made that man by listening to his stories."\par
\tab Around on the other side of the canopy, Nick Williams was sitting by \par
himself in another deck chair.  He was reading Madame Bovary and trying without \par
success to ignore both his residual hangover and the scattered tidbits of \par
conversation he was overhearing.  He had programmed the navigation system to \par
return automatically to the dive site from Thursday, so there was nothing else \par
he really needed to do to pilot the boat.  Nick almost certainly would have \par
enjoyed sharing the conversation with Carol and Troy, but after his earlier \par
confrontation with her, in which he felt she had made it clear that she didn't \par
want to associate with him, he was not about to join them.  It was now necessary \par
that he ignore her.  Otherwise she would conclude that he was just another wimp.\par
\tab And besides, he liked his book.  He was reading the part where Emma Bovary \par
gives herself over completely to the affair with Rudolph Boulanger.  Nick could \par
see Emma sneaking away from her house in the small French provincial village and \par
racing across the fields into the arms of her lover.  Most of the time in the \par
past, whenever Nick had read a novel about a beautiful, dark heroine, he had \par
pictured Monique.  But interestingly enough, the Emma Bovary that he was \par
envisioning while he was reading on the boat was Carol Dawson.  And more than \par
once that morning, when Nick had read Flaubert's descriptions of the passions of \par
Emma and Rudolph, he had imagined himself in the role of the bachelor from the \par
French landed gentry making love to Emma/Carol.\par
\tab The automatic navigation system that guided the boat while Nick was \par
reading consisted of a simple transmitter/receiver combination and a small \par
miniprocessor.  Taking advantage of a worldwide set of synchronous satellites, \par
software in the processor established the boat's location very precisely and \par
then followed a preprogrammed steering algorithm to the desired final site.  \par
Along the way, the two-way link with the satellite overhead provided the \par
necessary information to up date the path through the ocean.\par
\tab When the Florida Queen was within a mile of the dive site, the nav system \par
sounded a tone.  Nick then went to the controls and changed to manual guidance.  \par
Carol and Troy rose from their chairs.  "Remember," she said, "the primary \par
purpose of our dive is to photograph and salvage whatever it was that we saw \par
down in that fissure on Thursday.  If we have enough time afterward, we will go \par
back to the overhang where we found the trident."\par
\tab Carol walked over and switched on the monitor attached to the ocean \par
telescope.  She was standing only a few feet away from Nick.  They had not \par
exchanged any words since right after the boat left Key West.  "Good luck," he \par
said quietly.\par
\tab She looked at him to see whether he was serious or was being sarcastic.  \par
She couldn't tell.  "Thank you," she said evenly.\par
\tab Troy joined Carol at the monitor.  She pulled the photographs out of the \par
envelope so they could be used to define the exact spot to anchor.  For a couple \par
of minutes she issued instructions to Nick, based on what she was seeing from \par
the telescope, commanding small corrections to the boat's position.  At last the \par
ocean floor underneath them looked almost exactly as it had on Thursday when \par
they had seen the whales.  With one major difference.\par
\tab "Now where's that hole in the reef?"  Troy said innocently.  "I don't seem \par
to be able to find it on the monitor."\par
\tab Carol's heart was speeding as she glanced back and forth from the \par
telescope screen to the photographs.  Where is that fissure? she thought, It \par
can't have disappeared.  The boat drifted away from the dive site and Nick \par
steered it back.  This time Troy dropped the anchor overboard.  But Carol still \par
could not see any sign of the fissure.  She could not understand it.\par
\tab "Nick," she said finally, "could you give us a hand?  We were down there \par
together and we both saw the hole.  Are Troy and I just confused in some way?"\par
\tab Nick came over from the steering wheel under the canopy and stared into \par
the monitor.  He too was puzzled.  But he thought he saw other things on the \par
bottom of the ocean that also looked a little different.  "I don't see the hole \par
either," he said, "but maybe it's just the lighting.  We were here in the \par
afternoon last time and now it's ten in the morning."\par
\tab Troy turned to Carol.  "Maybe Nick ought to dive with you.  He was there \par
before, has seen the fissure, and knows how to find the overhang.  Everything I \par
know is from the pictures."\par
\tab "No," said Carol quickly.  "I want to dive with you.  Nick's probably \par
right.  We just can't see the fissure because of the different lighting."  She \par
picked up her underwater camera and walked around the canopy toward the back of \par
the boat.  "Let's get going," she said.  "We'll do just fine."\par
\tab Troy gave Nick a silent shrug, as if to say "I tried," and followed her a \par
few moments later.\par
\par

"BUT Richard," Ramirez said, "we could get into big trouble."\par
\tab "I don't see how," Lieutenant Todd replied.  "Or why anybody ever has to \par
know.  The Navy built the system, after all, primarily for its own ships.  We \par
just allow everyone else to use it.  All we have to do is interrogate the master \par
register and get the Doppler and ranging time history for their particular \par
identification code.  Then we can figure out where they are.  It's easy.  We do \par
it all the time for our own vessels."\par
\tab "But we signed a maritime convention restricting our access to the private \par
registers except in life-or-death or national security cases," Ramirez \par
continued.  "I can't just tap into the satellite files because you and I suspect \par
a certain boat of being on an illegal mission.  We need more authority."\par
\tab "Look, Roberto," Todd argued vehemently, "who do you think is going to \par
give us permission?  We don't have the photographs.  We only have your word for \par
it.  No.  We must act on our own.  If we're wrong, then nobody ever has to know \par
about it.  If we're right, we'll nail that bastard, we'll both be heroes, and \par
nobody will give us a hard time about what we've done."\par
\tab Ramirez was silent for a few seconds.  "Don't you at least think we should \par
inform Commander Winters?  He is, after all, the officer in charge of this \par
Panther investigation."\par
\tab "Absolutely not," said Lieutenant Todd quickly.  "You heard him at the \par
meeting yesterday.  He thinks we're out of line already.  He'd like nothing \par
better than to shit all over us.  He's jealous."  Todd saw that Ramirez was \par
still undecided.  "I'll tell you what," he said, "we'll call him after we find \par
out where the vessel is."\par
\tab Lieutenant Ramirez shook his head.  "That won't make any difference.  We \par
still will have exceeded our authority."\par
\tab "Shit," said Todd in exasperation.  "Tell me what has to be done and I'll \par
do it.  Without you.  I'll take all the risk."  He stopped and looked directly \par
at Ramirez.  "I can't fucking understand it.  I guess you Mexicans really are \par
gutless.  You're the one who actually saw the missile in the photograph, but .  \par
.  ."\par
\tab Ramirez's eyes narrowed.  His voice became hard.  "That's enough, Todd.  \par
We'll get the data.  But if this turns out to be a disaster, I will personally \par
break your neck with my own hands."\par
\tab "I knew you'd see it my way," Lieutenant Todd replied, smiling as he \par
followed Ramirez to a command console.\par
\par
\tab Commander Winters put the extra six-pack of Coke on the top of the ice and \par
then closed the cooler.  "Anything else," he shouted out the door at his wife \par
and son, "before I haul this thing out to the car?"\par
\tab "No, sir," was the reply from the driveway.  The commander picked up the \par
cooler and carried it through the screen door.  "Whew," he said, as he loaded it \par
in the open trunk of the car, "you have enough food and drink in here for a \par
dozen people."\par
\tab "I wish you were coming, sir," said Hap.  "Most of the rest of the fathers \par
will be there."\par
\tab "I know.  I know," answered Winters.  "But your mother's going.  And I \par
need to do some private rehearsing for tonight."  He gave his son a brief hug.  \par
"Besides, Hap, we've talked about this before.  Lately I haven't felt \par
comfortable at organized church activities.  I believe that religion is between \par
God and the individual."\par
\tab "You haven't always felt that way," Betty interjected from the other side \par
of the car.  "In fact, you used to love church picnics.  You'd play softball and \par
swim and we would laugh all evening."  There was just a trace of bitterness in \par
her voice.  "Come on, Hap."  she said after a momentary pause "We don't want to \par
be late.  Thank your father for helping us pack."\par
\tab "Thanks, Dad."  Hap climbed into the car and Winters closed the door \par
behind him.  They waved to each other as the Pontiac backed out of the driveway \par
into the street.  As they drove away, Winters mused to himself, I must spend \par
more time with him.  He needs me now.  If I don't it will soon be too late.\par
\tab He turned around and walked back into the house.  At the refrigerator he \par
stopped and opened the door.  He poured himself a glass of orange juice.  While \par
he was drinking it, he looked idly around the kitchen.  Already Betty had \par
cleaned up the breakfast dishes and put them in the dishwasher.  The counters \par
were scrubbed.  The morning paper was neatly folded on the breakfast table.  The \par
kitchen was tidy, orderly.  Like his wife.  She abhorred messes of all kinds.  \par
Winters remembered one morning, back when Hap was still in diapers and they were \par
living in Norfolk Virginia.  The little boy had been exuberantly pounding the \par
kitchen table and suddenly his arms had flailed out, knocking Betty's cup of \par
coffee and the creamer onto the floor.  They both broke and made quite a mess \par
all over the kitchen.  Betty had stopped her meal abruptly.  By the time she had \par
returned to her cold scrambled eggs, there was not the slightest indication \par
anywhere, not on the floors, the lower cupboard, or even in the wastebasket (she \par
packed all the broken pieces neatly in the basket liner and then removed the \par
entire bag to the outside cans), that there had been an accident.\par
\tab Just to the right of the refrigerator in the Winterses' kitchen, hanging \par
on the wall, there was a small plaque with simple lettering.  "For God so loved \par
the world," it said, "that He gave His only begotten son, that whosoever shall \par
believe in Him shall have everlasting life .  .  .  John 3:16."  Vernon Winters \par
saw this kitchen plaque every day, but he had not actually read the words for \par
months, maybe even years.  On this particular Saturday morning he read them and \par
was moved.  He thought about Betty's God, a God very similar to the one he had \par
worshipped in his childhood and adolescence in Indiana, a quiet, calm, wise old \par
man who sat up in heaven somewhere, watching everything, knowing everything, \par
waiting to receive and answer our prayers.  It was such a simple, beautiful \par
image.  "Our Father, Who art in Heaven," he said, recalling the hundreds maybe \par
thousands of times that he had prayed in church, "Hallowed be thy name.  Thy \par
kingdom come.  Thy will be done.  On Earth as it is in Heaven .  .  ."\par
\tab And what is Thy will for me, old man, Winters thought, a little taken \par
aback by his own irreverence.  For eight years You have let me drift.  Ignored \par
me.  Tested me like Job.  Or maybe punished me.  He walked over to the kitchen \par
table and sat down.  He took another sip from his orange juice.  But have I been \par
forgiven?  I don't yet know.  Never once in all that time have You given me a \par
definite sign.  Despite my prayers and my tears.  One time, he thought, right \par
after Libya, I wondered if maybe .  .  .\par
\tab He remembered being half asleep on the beach, lying on his back with his \par
eyes closed on a big comfortable towel.  In the distance he could hear the surf \par
and children's voices, occasionally he could even distinguish Hap's voice or \par
Betty's.  The summer sun was warm, relaxing.  A light began to dart about on the \par
inside of his eyelids.  Winters opened his eyes.  He couldn't see much because \par
the sunlight was too bright and there was also a glare, a metal glint of some \par
kind, in his eyes.  He shaded his forehead with his hand.  A little girl with \par
long hair, a year old perhaps, was standing just above him, staring at him.  The \par
glint was coming from the long metal comb in her hair.\par
\tab Winters closed his eyes and opened them again.  Now he could see her \par
better.  She had shifted her head just a little so the glare was gone.  But she \par
was still staring fixedly at him, with absolutely no expression on her face.  \par
She was wearing only diapers.  He could tell that she was foreign.  Arab \par
perhaps, he had thought at the time, looking back into her deep brown, almond-\par
shaped eyes.  She didn't move or say anything.  She just watched him, curious, \par
relentless, without seeming to notice anything that he did.\par
\tab "Hello," Winters said quietly.  "Who are you?"\par
\tab The little Arab girl gave no sign that she had heard anything.  After a \par
few seconds, however, she suddenly pointed her finger at him and her face looked \par
angry.  Winters shuddered and sat up abruptly.  His quick action frightened her \par
and she began to cry He reached for her but she pulled away, slipped, lost her \par
balance, and fell on the sand.  Her head hit something sharp when she fell and \par
blood started running down her scalp and onto her shoulder.  Terrified, first by \par
the fall and then by the sight of her own blood, the little girl began to wail.\par
\tab Winters hovered over her, struggling with his own panic as he watched the \par
blood splatter the sand.  Something unrecognized flashed through his mind and he \par
decided to pick the little Arab girl up to comfort her.  She fought him \par
violently, with the reckless abandon and surprising strength of the toddler, and \par
struggled free.  She fell again on the sand, on her side, the blood from her \par
scalp injury scattering drops of red around the light brown sand.  She was now \par
completely hysterical, crying so hard she often could not catch her breath, her \par
face suffused with fear and anger.  She pointed again at Winters.\par
\tab Within seconds a pair of dark brown arms swooped out of the sky and picked \par
her up.  For the first time Winters noticed that there were other people around, \par
lots of them in fact.  The little girl had been picked up by a man who must have \par
been her father, a short, squat Arab man in his mid-twenties wearing a bright \par
blue bathing suit.  He was holding his daughter protectively, looking as if he \par
were expecting a fight, and consoling his distraught young wife whose sobs \par
intermingled with the little girl's frantic cries.  Both the parents were \par
looking at Winters accusingly.  The mother daubed at the little girl's bleeding \par
head with a towel.\par
\tab "I didn't mean to hurt her," Winters said, recognizing as he spoke that \par
what he said would be misinterpreted.  "She fell and hit her head on something \par
and I .  .  ."  The Arab couple were backing away slowly.  Winters turned to the \par
others, maybe a dozen people who had come over in response to the little girl's \par
cries.  They also were looking at him strangely.  "I didn't mean to hurt her," \par
he repeated in a loud voice.  "I was just .  .  ."  He stopped himself.  Big \par
tears were falling off his face and onto the sand.  My God, he thought, I'm \par
crying.  No wonder these people .  .  .\par
\tab He heard another cry.  Betty and Hap had apparently just walked up behind \par
him as the Arab couple had backed away with their bleeding daughter.  Now, \par
having seen the blood on his father's hands, five-year-old Hap had broken into \par
tears and buried his face in his mother's hip.  He sobbed and sobbed.  Winters \par
looked at his hands, then at the people standing around him.  Impulsively he \par
bent down and tried to clean his hands in the sand.  The sound of his son's \par
sobbing punctuated his vain attempt to wipe his hands free of the blood.\par
\tab As he was kneeling in the sand, Commander Winters glanced at his wife \par
Betty for the first time since the incident had started.  What he saw on her \par
face was abject horror.  He entreated her for support with his eyes, but instead \par
her eyes glazed over and she too fell to her knees, careful not to disturb her \par
tearful son who was clinging to her side.  And Betty began to pray.  "Dear God," \par
she said with her eyes closed.\par
\tab The crowd dispersed slowly, several of them going over to the Arab family \par
to see if they could be of any help.  Winters stayed on his knees in the sand, \par
shaken by his own actions.\par
\tab At length Betty stood up.  "There, there," she consoled her son Hap, \par
"everything will be all right."  Without saying another word, she carefully \par
picked up the beach bag and towels and started walking toward the parking lot.  \par
The commander followed.\par
\tab They left the beach and drove back to Norfolk where they were living.  And \par
she never asked about it, Winters thought, as he sat at his kitchen table eight \par
years later.  She wouldn't even let me talk about it.  For at least three years.  \par
It was as if it had never happened.  Now she mentions it once in a blue moon.  \par
But we still have never discussed it.\par
\tab He finished his orange juice and lit a cigarette.  As he did so, he \par
thought immediately of Tiffani and the night before.  Fear and arousal \par
simultaneously stirred in Winters when he thought of the coming evening.  He \par
also found that he had a curious desire to pray.  And now dear God, he said \par
tentatively, are You testing me again?  He was suddenly aware of his own anger.  \par
Or are You laughing at me?  Maybe it wasn't enough for You to forsake me, to \par
leave me adrift.  Maybe You won't he satisfied until I am humiliated.\par
\tab Again he felt like crying.  But he resisted.  Winters crushed out his \par
cigarette and stood up from the table.  He walked over to the side of the \par
refrigerator and pulled the plaque containing the Bible verse off the wall.  He \par
started to throw it in the trash but, after hesitating for a second, he changed \par
his mind and put it in one of the kitchen drawers.\par
\par

\par
CAROL was swimming rapidly about six feet above the trench as they approached \par
the final turn.  She took a few photographs while she waited for Troy to catch \par
up, pointed down below her to where the tracks turned to the left, and then \par
started swimming again, more slowly this time, following the tracks in the \par
narrow crevice toward the overhang.  Nothing here had changed.  She motioned for \par
Troy to stay back and swam down into the trench, carefully, as she had done \par
before when she was with Nick.  Her search of the area under the overhang was \par
very thorough.  She did not find anything.\par
\tab She gestured to Troy that nothing was there, and then, after another quick \par
sequence of photographs, the two divers began retracing their path, going back \par
along the tracks toward the area under the boat where they had already spent \par
fifteen minutes earlier searching fruitlessly for the fissure they had seen on \par
Thursday.  It had mysteriously vanished.  All the tracks, although somewhat \par
eroded, still converged in front of the reef structure where the hole had been \par
just two days before.  Carol had poked and prodded, even damaged the reef in \par
several places (which, as an environmentalist, she hated to do, but she was \par
certain the hole had to be there), but had not found the fissure.  If Troy had \par
not seen it so clearly, first on the ocean telescope monitor and then in the \par
pictures, he would have thought that it was just a figment of Nick and Carol's \par
collective imagination.\par
\tab As Carol, deep in her thoughts, turned right over the main trench after \par
leaving the side path that had led to the overhang, she was careless and brushed \par
ever so slightly against a crop of coral that was extending outward from the \par
reef.  She felt a sting on her hand.  She looked down and saw that she was \par
bleeding.  That's funny, she thought, I just barely touched it.  Her mind \par
flashed back to ten minutes before, when she had been roughly pushing the coral \par
and kelp aside in search of the fissure.  And I wasn't even scratched .  .  .\par
\tab A wild, inchoate idea started forming in her mind.  Excited now, she \par
intensified her swimming down the long trench where the fissure had been.  Troy \par
could not keep up with her.  It was a long swim but Carol completed it in about \par
four or five minutes.  She checked her regulator pressure as she waited for her \par
diving partner.  They exchanged the thumbs-up sign when he arrived and Carol \par
tried.  without success, to explain her idea to Troy using hand signals.  \par
Finally, she bravely reached out and grabbed a piece of coral with her hand.  \par
Carol saw Troy's eyes open wide and his face grimace behind his mask.  She \par
opened her hard.  There were no cuts, no scrapes, no blood.  Astounded, Troy \par
swam over beside her to look at the coral colony she had just disturbed.  He too \par
could touch and even hold this strange coral without cutting his hand.  What was \par
going on?\par
\tab Carol was now pulling the coral and kelp away from the reef.  Troy watched \par
in amazement as a huge segment of the reef structure seemed to peel off, almost \par
like a blanket .  .  .\par
\tab They heard the great WHOOSH only milliseconds before they felt the pull.  \par
A giant chasm opened in the reef behind them and everything in the area, Troy, \par
Carol, schools of fish, plants of all kinds, and an enormous volume of water, \par
was swept into the hole.  The current was very swift but the channel was not too \par
large, for Carol and Troy bounced against what felt like metallic sides a couple \par
of times.  There was no time to think.  They were carried along, as if on a \par
water slide, and simply had to wait for the ride to be over.\par
\tab The dark gave way to a deep dusk and the current slowed markedly.  \par
Separated by about twenty feet, Carol and Troy each tried to gather his wits and \par
figure out what was happening.  They appeared to be in the outer annulus of a \par
large circular tank and were going around and around, passing gates of some kind \par
after every ninety degrees of revolution.  The water in the tank was about ten \par
feet deep.  Carol rolled on her back and looked up.  She could see a lot of \par
large structures above her, some of them moving, that seemed to be made out of \par
metal or plastic.  She could not see Troy anywhere.  She tried to grab the sides \par
of the tank so she could stop and look for him.  It was useless.  She could not \par
resist the motion of the current.\par
\tab They made three or four trips around the circle without seeing each other.  \par
Troy noticed that all the fish and plants had slowly disappeared from their \par
annulus, suggesting that some kind of sorting process was underway.  Suddenly \par
the current increased and he was pitched forward and down, under the water and \par
then through a half-open gate, into darkness again.  Just as a trace of light \par
appeared above the water and the rate of flow again slowed, he felt something \par
clamp on to his right arm.\par
\tab Troy was lifted out of the water a foot or so.  In the dim light he \par
couldn't see exactly what it was that had caught him, but it felt very strong.  \par
It held him without additional movement.  Troy looked behind him in the current, \par
where he had been, and he saw Carol's tumbling body approaching.  With his free \par
left arm he grabbed at her.  She felt his arm and immediately wrapped herself \par
around it.  She composed herself, lifted her head out of the water, and \par
struggled to reach the trunk of Troy's body.  She succeeded in holding tight to \par
him as the current rushed past.  She caught her breath and for just a moment \par
their eyes met behind their diving masks.\par
\tab Then, inexplicably, the clamp released.  When they were back in the water, \par
the current did not seem so strong.  They were able to hold on to each other \par
without much difficulty.  After about fifteen seconds, the flow of the water \par
slowed down altogether.  They had been deposited in a pool in what appeared to \par
be a large room and the water was draining out, running into some unseen orifice \par
at the far end of the room.  The last of the water disappeared.  Shaken and \par
exhausted Carol and Troy started to stand up in their diving gear.\par
\tab Carol had great difficulty getting to her feet.  Troy helped her up and \par
then pointed to his regulator.  Ever so slowly, he slipped out of his mouthpiece \par
and sampled the ambient environment.  One breath, then another.  As far as he \par
could tell, he was breathing normal air.  He shrugged his shoulders at Carol \par
and, in a fit of bravado, took off his mask as well.  "Hellooo," he shouted \par
nervously, "Anybody there?  You have guests out here."\par
\tab Carol slowly removed both her mask and her regulator.  She had a dazed \par
look on her face.  The two of them looked around.  The ceiling was about ten \par
feet above them.  Overall the dimensions of the chamber were roughly equivalent \par
to a large living room in a nice suburban home.  The walls, however, were quite \par
unusual.  Instead of being flat and forming nice right-angle joints at each of \par
the intersections, the walls were made of large, curved surfaces, some concave \par
and some convex, that were alternately colored red and blue.  Without thinking, \par
Carol began walking around, slowly of course because of the bulky diving gear, \par
and taking photographs.\par
\tab "Uh, just a moment, Miss Dawson," Troy said with a hesitant smile.  He \par
pulled off his flippers and followed her.  "Before you take any more pictures, \par
angel, would you kindly tell this unsophisticated black boy just where in the \par
fuck he is?  I mean, last I knew, I was going down under the boat to look for a \par
hole.  I think I found it, but I must say it's a trifle unnerving to be visiting \par
someone and not know just who it is.  So could you stop with the journalism bit \par
for just a minute and tell me why you are so calm."\par
\tab Carol was right in front of one of the concave blue wall panels.  There \par
were two or three indentations in the wall structure, at about eye level, that \par
formed circles or ellipses.  "Now what do you suppose this is?"  Carol wondered \par
aloud.  Her voice sounded flat, as if she were far away.\par
\tab "Carol," Troy almost shouted.  "Stop it.  Stop right now.  We can't just \par
blissfully walk around here as if this is a typical afternoon stroll through a \par
model house.  We have to talk.  Where are we? How are we going; to get out and \par
go home?  Home, remember the place?  I guarantee you it's not under the ocean \par
two hours away from shore."  He grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her.\par
\tab She started to snap out of her daze.  She looked slowly around the entire \par
room and then back at Troy.  "Jesus," she said.  "And shit."  He saw her tremble \par
a little and stepped forward to hug her.  She indicated for him to leave her \par
alone.  "I'm all right.  At least almost."  Carol took a couple of deep breaths \par
and then smiled.  "Anyway, I've sure got one hell of a story here."  She looked \par
around the room again.  "Uh Troy," she said with her brow wrinkled, "how did we \par
get in here?  I don't see a doorway or an opening or anything."\par
\tab "Good question," Troy replied.  "A very good question, to which I might \par
have the answer.  I think these crazy colored walls move around.  I believe I \par
saw the walls rolling into place when I was under the water.  So all we have to \par
do is push them aside and find our way out."  He tried to wedge his hands into a \par
crack that was a connection between a red and a blue piece of the wall \par
structure.  He was unsuccessful.\par
\tab Carol left Troy and started to pace around the perimeter of the room in \par
her ungainly diving apparatus.  She quickly stopped and took off everything \par
except her bathing suit.  She seemed intent on both examining and photographing \par
every single panel in the wall.  Troy took off his own air tanks and buoyancy \par
vest as well, dropping them on the light metal floor with a clank.  He watched \par
her for a minute.\par
\tab "Carol, oh Carol," he said from across the room, a big fake grin spreading \par
across his face.  "Would you like to tell me what you're doing now?  I mean, \par
after all, angel, I may be able to help."\par
\tab "I'm looking for something that says 'Eat Me' or 'Drink Me,' " she replied \par
with a nervous laugh.\par
\tab "Of course," Troy mumbled to himself, "that was absolutely obvious."\par
\tab "Do you remember Alice in Wonderland?" Carol asked from the opposite side \par
of the room.  She had found a long, thin protuberance that looked like a handle \par
sticking out from the center of one of the red panels.  She waved and he came \par
over.  The two of them tried to twist and turn the handle.  Nothing happened.  \par
Carol became frustrated struggling with it.\par
\tab Troy thought he saw a first sign of panic in Carol as her eyes frantically \par
scanned the rest of the room.  He pulled himself up and stood at attention, \par
military style.  "Speak roughly to your little boy .  .  .  And beat him when he \par
sneezes .  .  .  He only does it to annoy .  .  because he knows it teases."\par
\tab The deep furrows in Carol's face showed that she thought Troy had \par
temporarily lost his mind.  "That was the Queen of Hearts, I think."  Troy \par
laughed.  "I'm not sure exactly.  But I had to learn it for a play when I was in \par
the fifth grade."  Carol had relaxed and was also laughing in spite of her fear.  \par
She reached up and gave Troy a kiss on the cheek.  "Careful, now, careful," he \par
said with a twinkle in his eye.  "We black men are easily aroused."\par
\tab Carol slid her arm through Troy's as they finished walking around the rest \par
of the room, searching the walls for any sign of an exit Troy's banter made \par
Carol feel comfortable.  "When I was in the eighth grade a black teacher of mine \par
told me that Alice was a racist story.  He contended that it was very \par
significant that it was a white rabbit that Alice followed.  He said that no \par
nice little white girl would ever have pursued a black rabbit down a hole."  He \par
stopped in front of another red panel.  "Well, well," he said.  "What have we \par
here?"\par
\tab This red panel looked just like the rest of the wall from a distance.  But \par
up close, within a range of a couple of feet or so, all kinds of patterns, made \par
with small white dots, could be seen stippled on top of the red paint.  An array \par
of consecutive rectangular sections outlined by the white dots high-lighted the \par
center of the panel "Hey, angel," Troy said, pushing on the sections at random, \par
"don't you think this looks suspiciously like a keyboard?"  Troy began to push \par
on the keys at random.  Carol joined him.  It became a game.  The two of them \par
stood at the red panel for almost a minute, putting their fingers into every \par
outlined section and pushing hard.\par
\tab Suddenly Carol backed away from the panel, turned around, and started \par
walking directly across the room.  "Where are you going?" yelled Troy, as Carol, \par
spinning around to answer, nearly stumbled over her diving gear on the floor.\par
\tab "I have a crazy idea," called Carol.  "Call it feminine intuition.  Call \par
it psychic if you will."  She had reached the red panel where they had struggled \par
with the handle.  Now she pulled it down easily and immediately heard a creak.  \par
She jumped back, startled, as the entire panel folded back and away from her, \par
revealing a dark opening large enough for a truck to enter.  Troy came over \par
beside her and the two of them stared into the void.\par
\tab "Holy shit," he said "Are we supposed to go in there?"\par
\tab Carol nodded.  "I'm certain we are."\par
\tab Troy looked at her with a curious expression.  "And just how do you know \par
that?"\par
\tab "Because it's the only way out of here," Carol replied.\par
\tab Troy cast one final glance around the strange room with the curved and \par
colored walls.  There was an indisputable logic to what Carol had said.  He took \par
a deep breath, held Carol's hand, and walked into the black tunnel.\par
\par
\tab Behind them they could barely see the small shaft of light coming from the \par
room where they had left their diving gear.  Inside the pitch-black hallway they \par
moved very slowly, cautiously.  Troy kept one hand on the wall and the other \par
clenched around Carol's.  The sound of their labored breathing, heightened by \par
the constant fear and apprehension, reverberated off the rounded walls.  They \par
didn't talk.  Twice Troy had started to sing a few lines from a popular song, to \par
assuage his own disquiet, but both times Carol stopped him.  She wanted to be \par
able to hear in case there were any other noises.\par
\tab At one point she squeezed his hand and stopped.  "Listen," she said in a \par
whisper.  Troy held his breath.  There was utter silence, except for something \par
very soft that he couldn't quite identify, way off in the distance.  "Music," \par
Carol said.  "I think I hear music."\par
\tab Troy strained to identify the sound just below the threshold of his \par
hearing.  It was useless.  He pulled on Carol's hand.  "It's probably inside \par
your head," he said.  "Let's go."\par
\tab They had made a turn and the light behind them had disappeared.  \par
Altogether they had been in the tunnel for about ten minutes.  Carol was \par
becoming despondent.  "What if this doesn't go anywhere?" she asked Troy.\par
\tab "That doesn't make any sense," he replied quickly.  "Somebody built it for \par
some purpose.  It's obviously a connecting passageway."  He fell silent.\par
\tab "Who built it?"  Carol asked the question that had been troubling both of \par
them during the long tense walk down the dark hallway.\par
\tab "Another good question," Troy replied.  He hesitated just a minute before \par
continuing with his answer.  "My guess is the United States Navy.  I think we're \par
in some kind of top-secret underwater laboratory that nobody knows about."  Of \par
course, he thought, not saying it out loud because he didn't want to disturb \par
Carol, it could also be Russian.  In which case we are in deep shit.  If the \par
Russians have a large, secret laboratory this close to Key West, they are not \par
going to be happy .  .  .\par
\tab "Look, Troy," Carol said excitedly.  "I see a light.  There is somebody \par
here after all."  The tunnel was about to split into two pans.  At the end of \par
one of the two forks, the one sharply to the left, a patch of illumination could \par
clearly be seen.  Still holding hands, Troy and Carol walked briskly toward the \par
light.  Troy was aware that his heart was beating very rapidly\par
\tab Carol almost raced into the new room.  She had expected that they were \par
about to be found, that this mysterious adventure was now going to end and \par
everything would be explained.  Instead, as she looked around her in a small, \par
oval chamber with the same bizarre panels for walls (except these were colored \par
brown and white, instead of red and blue as in the previous room), she felt a \par
tremendous confusion.  "What is this place?" she asked Troy.  "And how are we \par
going to get out?"\par
\tab Troy was standing in the center of the room with his head tilted back as \par
far as it would go.  He was staring up at a vast arched ceiling some thirty to \par
thirty-five feet above them.  "Wow," he exclaimed, "this is one huge place."  \par
The muted light illuminating the room was coming from slabs of partially \par
translucent material, possibly glass crystals, that were embedded in the \par
ceiling.\par
\tab The brown and white panels forming the walls for the particular room they \par
had entered were only ten feet high, but they were high enough to prevent Carol \par
and Troy from seeing out.  They had a strange sense of both freedom and \par
confinement.  On the one hand, first the tunnel and now this small room, the \par
size of a child's bedroom in a small house, had made them feel claustrophobic; \par
however, the sense of space conveyed by the cathedral ceilings was liberating.\par
\tab "Well?" asked Carol, somewhat impatiently, after waiting a few moments \par
while Troy walked around and surveyed the room.  He was observing that the brown \par
and white wall panels were only slightly curved and were thus much closer to \par
normal walls than those in the initial room had been.\par
\tab "I'm sorry, angel," he replied, "I forgot the question."\par
\tab She shook her head.  "There is only one question, Mr. Jefferson.  I \par
believe that you asked it of me on our last tour stop."  She looked at her \par
watch.  "In about fifteen minutes, we will have exceeded the maximum time for \par
our air supply.  Unless I miss my guess, our friend Nick is probably starting to \par
worry right now.  But we still have no idea .  .  .  What are you doing?"\par
\tab She interrupted herself when Troy bent down to pull a small knob on one of \par
the brown panels in the corner of the room.  "These are drawers, angel," he \par
said, as the bottom part of the panel came out several inches from the wall.  \par
"Like a dresser."  He opened a second drawer above the first.  "And they have \par
something in them."\par
\tab Carol came over to see.  She reached into the second drawer that Troy had \par
opened and pulled out a rust-colored sphere about the size of a tennis ball.  \par
The surface of the ball was very curious.  Instead of being smooth and regular, \par
it had grooves cut into it, mostly on one side, and tiny bumps, like those on \par
the surface of a pickle, around and next to the grooves.  In other places there \par
were poorly defined indentations as well.  Carol examined the sphere in the weak \par
light.  "I've seen something like this before," she said.  "But where?"  She \par
thought for a few seconds.  "I've got it," she announced, pleased that her \par
memory had come through, "this looks exactly like the model of Mars in the \par
National Air and Space Museum."\par
\tab "Then I must have the Earth," Troy replied, showing her a mostly blue \par
sphere the size of a softball that he had removed from the top drawer.  The two \par
of them stood together in the dim light, looking back and forth at the spheres \par
they were holding in their hands.  "Shit," Troy shouted eventually, spinning \par
around and looking at the ceiling.  "And double shit.  Whoever you are, we've \par
had enough.  Come out now and identify yourself."\par
\tab A partial echo of his voice came back to them.  Otherwise they heard \par
nothing.  Anxious to be doing something, Carol continued her search of the room.  \par
She found another group of three drawers in a nearby brown panel.  While she was \par
opening the first of these, Troy playfully hurled his blue ball at what appeared \par
to be an exit, a dark opening between panels on the other side of the room.  The \par
sphere hit a white panel near the exit with a thunk and started to fall to the \par
floor.  However, just before it touched the ground, the sphere lifted up, as if \par
pulled somehow from above, and stopped in the center of the room about five feet \par
above the floor.  It began to spin.\par
\tab Troy's eyes opened wide.  He walked over to the sphere and placed his hand \par
between the ball and high ceiling, trying to find the strings.  Nothing \par
happened.  The Earth sphere continued to spin slowly and inscribe a circle in \par
the air in the middle of the room.  Troy pushed the ball lightly.  It moved in \par
response to his push, but after his applied force was removed and the effect had \par
dissipated, the sphere returned to its previous location and continued its \par
earlier movement.  Troy turned around.  Carol had her back to him and was \par
searching unsuccessfully for another set of drawers.  The Mars ball was still in \par
her left hand.\par
\tab "Uh, Carol," Troy said slowly.  "Would you mind coming over here a \par
moment?"\par
\tab "Certainly," she replied without looking.  "Jesus, Troy, these drawers are \par
full of all kinds .  .  ."  She had turned around and now noticed the Earth \par
sphere hovering in the air near the center of the room.  Her brow knitted.  \par
"That's cute," she said tentatively, "real cute.  I didn't know you were a \par
magician as well."  Her voice trailed off.  She could see the perplexed \par
expression on Troy's face.  She walked over next to him to have a closer look.\par
\tab The two of them stood silently for at least ten seconds as they watched \par
the blue softball slowly spin in the air.  Next Troy took the Mars sphere from \par
Carol and tossed it, under-handed, up toward the high ceiling.  It arched up and \par
fell down normally, until it was just above the floor.  Then, like the blue \par
sphere before it, the Mars ball developed its own sense of direction and \par
momentum.  It floated up about five feet off the floor, began to spin slowly, \par
and hovered in the air next to the blue sphere representing the Earth.\par
\tab Carol grabbed Troy's hand.  She shivered and then regained her composure.  \par
"There's something about this that gives me the willies," she said.  "All in \par
all, I would deal better with a caterpillar asking me, 'Who are you?' At least \par
in that case I would have some idea what I'm up against."\par
\tab Troy turned around and led Carol back over to the partially opened \par
drawers.  "I ran into this old bearded dude once when I was hitchhiking," he \par
began, as he pulled out a basketball that was covered with latitudinal belts and \par
bands in shades of red and orange.  He aimlessly tossed the big Jupiter ball \par
over his shoulder, using both hands.  Carol watched it, still fascinated, as it \par
joined the other two spheres orbiting around an empty focus in the middle of the \par
room.\par
\tab "He was driving an old run-down pickup truck and smoking a joint.  At \par
first we talked a little.  He would ask me questions and I would start to give \par
an answer.  But after a sentence or two, he would interrupt me and say, 'You \par
don't know shit, man.'  That was his response to everything."\par
\tab Troy methodically emptied all six of the drawers while he was telling his \par
story.  He threw all the objects he found into the center of the room.  A few of \par
them he watched, casually, as if he were witnessing an everyday occurrence.  \par
Each of the new spheres repeated the earlier pattern.  A nearly complete working \par
model of the solar system was forming about five feet above the f1oor.\par
\tab "Finally I grew tired of his game and was quiet.  We drove along for miles \par
in silence.  It was a clear and beautiful night and he kept hanging his head out \par
the window to look at the stars.  Once, when he pulled his head back in, he lit \par
another joint, handed it to me, and pointed back out the window at the stars.  \par
'They know, man, they know,' he said.  Miles later, when he let me out of the \par
truck, he leaned over and I could see the wildness in his eyes.  'Remember, \par
man,' he whispered, 'you don't know shit.  But they know.' "\par
\tab As Troy finished the tale, Carol came over beside him and pulled out two \par
handfuls of tiny fragments from the final drawer.  They were a little sticky to \par
the touch.  She shook them off her hands and they miraculously flew around the \par
room and coalesced into the ring systems of Saturn and Uranus.  She looked at \par
Troy in awe.\par
\tab "Does that bizarre story have a point?"  Carol asked.  "I must admit that \par
I am amazed at how nonchalant you are about this whole damn thing.  For myself, \par
I'm just about ready to freak out.  Completely."\par
\tab Troy pointed at the miniature planets floating in the air.  "What we are \par
seeing has no explanation in terms of our experience.  We've either died \par
together or transferred to a new dimension or someone is playing mind games with \par
us."  He smiled at Carol.  "If you must know, angel, I'm scared absolutely \par
shitless.  But like that old stoned hippie, I keep telling myself, 'They know.' \par
Somehow it gives me comfort."\par
\tab They heard a soft sliding sound and a shaft of bright light burst into the \par
room from an opening that was forming between two panels, one brown and one \par
white, just to the right of the exit.  Carol recoiled automatically and covered \par
her eyes for an instant.  Troy also jumped back at first, but then shaded his \par
eyes with his hands and watched.  The panels continued to slide until an opening \par
about two feet wide had developed.  The room was beginning to fill with light.  \par
Troy saw a great illuminated ball coming slowly through the opening.  "Here \par
comes the Sun Doot-un-Doo-Doo Doo .  .  .  Here comes the Sun," he sang \par
anxiously, "And I say .  .  .  it's all right .  .  ."  He hummed a few more \par
bars of the song as Carol opened her eyes.\par
\tab "Jesus," she said.  The bright orb, the size of a giant beach ball, lifted \par
itself into its proper place in the orrery and flooded the entire room with its \par
radiance.  The spinning, orbiting planets shone with reflected light from their \par
sides facing the Sun.  Carol stood transfixed, silent tears running down her \par
face.  She could not speak or move.  She was completely overwhelmed.\par
\tab Troy was also frightened, but not yet so much that his ability to function \par
was impaired.  However, a moment later he saw something in the exit that sent a \par
bolt of terror through his system.  His heart surged into overdrive as he \par
blinked and then squinted, making certain his mind was not playing tricks on him \par
as he looked just around the bright light of the model Sun.  Instinctively, he \par
turned to protect Carol and shielded her from what he had just seen.\par
\tab "Don't look now," he whispered, "but we have a visitor."\par
\tab "What?" said Carol, confused and still stunned.\par
\tab Troy held her by the arms and they moved together several steps to the \par
right.  He looked over his own shoulder and saw the thing again.\par
\tab "Over by the exit," he said, turning around, unable any longer to hide his \par
panic.\par
\tab Carol's eyes indicated that she had found the source of Troy's terror.  \par
She had no idea what it was, but she could see that it was large, clearly \par
threatening, and absolutely different from anything that she had ever seen or \par
imagined.  It had also moved into the room.  She heard Troy's frantic, \par
incoherent shouts, but their meaning didn't register.  She looked at the thing \par
again and her mind balked.  She opened her mouth to scream.  Nothing came out at \par
first.  She dropped to her knees on the floor.  She heard the sound of screams \par
in her ear, but they seemed far, far away.  Her brain was sending a message that \par
said, 'You're screaming,' but for some reason it didn't seem possible.  It had \par
to be someone else.\par
\tab The thing was coming toward her Its main body was about eight feet tall at \par
that moment, but it was continually changing its shape and size as it undulated \par
across the room.  Whatever it was, Troy and Carol could see into it and even \par
through parts of its structure.  A transparent external boundary membrane was \par
wrapped around a permanently seething set of mostly clear fluid matter that \par
ebbed and flowed with each movement.  The thing moved like an amoeba, matter \par
simply heading in the right direction, but with astonishing speed.  Tiny black \par
dots were scattered just behind all its external surfaces, darting in all \par
directions, apparently supervising the continuous reconfigurations that gave it \par
motion.  A half dozen chunks of grayish, opaque matter, objects a foot or so \par
square, were also embedded near the center of the primary body.\par
\tab But it was not the main body of the thing that was so terrifying.  \par
Protruding from its upper portions was a frightening array of a dozen \par
appendages, mostly long and slender in shape, that appeared to be stuck into the \par
main body like sharp objects in a pin cushion.  It looked as if the large, \par
clear, amoebalike structure was a versatile transportation system that could \par
carry virtually anything and that the payload, at least for this usage, was this \par
family of constantly active rods, all of which were threatening because their \par
end effectors resembled needles, hands, brushes, teeth, and even swords and \par
guns.  In Carol's mind, she was being attacked by a heavily armored tank that \par
could change size in an instant and move on invisible treads in any direction.\par
\tab Troy moved to the side, trying to calm his fear and catch his breath, as \par
he watched the thing zero in on Carol.  Its longest attachment, a reddish \par
plastic implement which split into two short tines about a foot away from the \par
primary body, suddenly extended itself outward an additional three feet and \par
stopped just six inches in front of Carol's eyes.  She screamed and pushed it \par
away, forcefully, but it popped right back into position.  Troy plucked the \par
Jupiter ball out of the air and, with all his might, hurled the sphere at the \par
center of the thing.  The shapeless mass fell back on impact and immediately \par
retracted its extended appendages.  But in an instant the thing reconfigured \par
itself somehow and adjusted its matter to let the ball pass completely through.  \par
Before it hit the floor on the other side, Jupiter rose into the air and came \par
back to take its proper position in the solar system model.\par
\tab The thing had now stopped advancing toward Carol.  It was sitting in the \par
middle of the room, its spindly appendages flailing around in all directions.  \par
It seemed to be making a decision.  Troy bravely grabbed a rod with an end \par
effector like a brush and tried to pull it away from the main structure.  \par
Instantly, core clear material flowed into the joint where that particular rod \par
was attached, strengthening the connection.  But Troy's action definitely caused \par
a change in its pattern.  The thing started after him.  Ever so carefully, \par
making sure it would follow him while watching out for another quick extension \par
of the red implement with the two tines, Troy edged toward the exit.  As the \par
thing continued to move toward him, Troy motioned for Carol to get back.  Then \par
he broke for the door, tripping slightly over an extended rod on his way out.\par
\tab It hardly hesitated.  With surprising celerity the thing made itself short \par
and squat.  A maximum amount of exposed surface was now on the floor and it \par
could move more quickly and efficiently.  The deployed group of attachments were \par
placed into some kind of compact traveling configuration and the thing hustled \par
out the door.\par
\tab Carol was left alone on her knees on the floor.  The solar system model \par
was above her and to the right.  For over a minute she didn't move.  She just \par
watched the spinning planets abstractedly and listened for the occasional sound \par
of Troy's footfalls in the distance.  At length there was a long period of \par
silence and Carol rose to her feet.  She took several small, slow steps, \par
reassuring herself that she was all right, and then walked over to the exit \par
opening between the panels.  The exit opened onto a corridor that ran in both \par
directions.\par
\tab Troy had gone to the right when he had left the room.  After remembering \par
her camera and going back to take a few quick photographs of the suspended \par
planets, Carol followed Troy's path, also taking the corridor to the right.  She \par
walked slowly down the black hall, turning around frequently to locate the light \par
coming from the room that she had just left.  There was now a close ceiling over \par
her head.  The hall next split into two forks; both directions were dark.  Carol \par
listened for sounds.  Again she thought she heard music, but she couldn't begin \par
to identify where it was coming from.\par
\tab This time she chose the left fork in the hallway.  Soon it narrowed and \par
seemed to be circling back in the direction from which she had just come.  She \par
was just about to turn around and retrace her steps when she distinctly heard \par
two noises, something like a thud followed by a scraping sound, off to the right \par
in front of her.  Drawing her breath slowly and struggling to conquer her fear, \par
Carol moved forward in the dark.  After about twenty more feet she came upon a \par
low door that opened to the right.  She bent down slightly and peered in.  In \par
the dusky light she saw unusual shapes and structures in another small room with \par
walls made of the now familiar curved and colored panels.  She crawled through \par
the doorway and stood up.\par
\tab Soft local lights located in a few of the wall panels came on as soon as \par
Carol's feet contacted the floor in the room.  Her arrival also triggered two or \par
three notes from some kind of musical instrument.  It sounded like an organ and \par
was apparently way off in the distance in another part of the cathedral area \par
enclosed by the vast arched ceilings that were again above her.  She stopped, \par
surprised.  She stood still for several seconds.  Then, without moving, Carol \par
carefully surveyed her new surroundings.\par
\tab In this room the wall panels were very bright, alternating between purple \par
and gold, and they were extremely curved.  Along with Carol in the room there \par
were three objects of unknown purpose.  One looked like a writing table, a \par
second like a long, low bench that was wide at one end and tapered to a point at \par
the other, and the third resembled a very tall telephone pole whose top and \par
bottom were connected by sixteen thin strings stretched out and around a broad \par
ring about one third of the way down the pole.\par
\tab Carol could walk between the thin strings.  The ring, made out of a gold \par
metallic material, was a couple of feet above her head, almost at the level of \par
the top of the wall panels.  She grabbed one of the strings and felt it vibrate.  \par
It made a muffled, flat sound.  She backed away from the string and tried to \par
pluck it.  A note sounded, very lyrical, like a heavy harp.  Carol realized she \par
was standing inside a musical instrument.  But how to play it?  She spent a few \par
minutes wandering around the room, trying without success to find the equivalent \par
of a bow.  She knew it would be impossible to play the harp if she had to run \par
around and pluck each individual string herself.\par
\tab She walked over to the writing table.  She quickly figured out that it was \par
also a musical instrument.  It looked much more promising.  There were \par
indentations in the table, sixty-four altogether, set up in eight rows and eight \par
columns.  Pressing each key produced a different sound.  Although Carol had \par
taken five years of piano lessons as a small child, it was a difficult chore, at \par
first, for her even to play "Silent Night" on the strange writing table.  She \par
had to correlate the sounds made by pressing the individual keys with the notes \par
and chords that she remembered from her childhood.  While she was teaching \par
herself to play the instrument, she stopped often to listen to the delicate, \par
crystal sound that it made.  It reminded her mostly of a xylophone.\par
\tab Carol stood at the table for several minutes.  Eventually she played an \par
entire verse of "Silent Night" without making a single mistake.  Carol smiled, \par
pleased with herself, and relaxed momentarily.  During this interlude the great \par
organ in the distance (which she had heard briefly when she had entered the room \par
and could now pinpoint as being somewhere in the upper reaches of the cathedral \par
area) suddenly began to play.  Carol felt goose bumps rise on her arms, \par
partially due to the beauty of the music and partially because it reminded her \par
again of what a bizarre world she had entered.  What is that organ playing? she \par
thought to herself.  It sounds like an overture.  She listened for a few \par
seconds.  Why .  .  .  that's an introduction.  To "Silent Night"!  It's very \par
creative.\par
\tab The organ sound was joined by several others, each emanating from \par
somewhere in the ceiling.  All the instruments together played a complex version \par
of the "Silent Night" that Carol had so painstakingly pounded out on the writing \par
table a few moments before.  The beautiful music swelled throughout the \par
cathedral.  Carol looked up and then closed her eyes.  She spun her body around \par
and around in a little dance.  When she opened her eyes again, each of them \par
confronted what appeared to be a tiny optical instrument no more than an inch \par
away.  Carol froze in terror.\par
\tab The thing had noiselessly come up behind her while she was playing music \par
at the writing table and had waited patiently, while deploying its appendages, \par
until she was ready to turn around.  It was about her height now and the closest \par
part of the translucent main body was only an arm's length away.  As Carol stood \par
there motionless, barely daring to breathe, five or six of the thing's \par
attachments came forward to touch her.  A small digging instrument scraped some \par
skin off her bare shoulder.  The sword cut off some of her hair.  A tiny cord \par
attached to one of the long rods wrapped around her wrist.  A set of bristles \par
the size of the head of a toothbrush traveled across her chest, tickling her \par
nipples through her bathing suit and crossing over the camera that was draped \par
around her neck.  She was having so many feelings simultaneously that she had \par
lost track of all the stimuli.  Carol closed her eyes and tried to concentrate \par
on something else.  She felt a needle prick her forehead.\par
\tab It was over very fast, less than a minute altogether.  The thing retracted \par
its appendages, backed up a couple of feet and stood there, observing her from a \par
distance.  Carol waited.  After another twenty seconds, the attachments were \par
stowed, as they had been when the thing had gone after Troy, and it left the \par
room.\par
\tab Carol listened for sounds.  It was totally quiet again.  She backed up \par
from the writing table and tried to organize her thoughts.  After about a \par
minute, the purple and gold wall panels began to move to the side on their own \par
accord.  They folded upon themselves and formed small stacks.  Then the \par
corridors around the music room collapsed and automatically organized their \par
partitions into neat piles.  Carol found herself standing in one huge room under \par
the cathedral ceilings.  In the distance her weird antagonist with the flailing \par
appendages passed through a side door about twenty-five yards away and \par
disappeared quickly from view.\par
\tab She looked around.  There was no sign of Troy.  The walls were creamy \par
white and nondescript, somewhat boring after the colored panels in the earlier \par
rooms.  There were two doors, opposite each other in the middle of the room.  \par
Except for the musical instruments, which now seemed completely out of place \par
clustered together at one end of such a vast room, the only other object she \par
could see was a small piece of carpet against thc wall to the left.  In front of \par
her against the far wall, about fifty yards away, there was what appeared to be \par
a large window on the ocean.  Even from a distance she could see and identify \par
some of the fish swimming by.\par
\tab At first Carol hurried toward the window.  When she was about halfway \par
there and even with the doors, she stopped a few seconds and took a few \par
photographs of the rather bland room.  Curiously, the small carpet was not where \par
she remembered it.  It had somehow been moved while she was walking.  She \par
approached the carpet very slowly.  Her weird experiences since she and Troy had \par
been sucked out of the ocean had made Carol understandably wary.  As she drew \par
closer, she saw that the flat object lying on the floor was definite]y not a \par
carpet.  From above she could see an intricate internal design, like a complex \par
network of sophisticated electronic chips.  There were strange whorls and \par
geometric patterns on its surface; they had no specific meaning to Carol but \par
they reminded her of the fractal designs Dr. Dale had shown her one night in his \par
apartment.  The symmetries of the object were readily apparent.  In fact, each \par
of the four quadrants of the carpet was identical.\par
\tab It was about six feet long, three feet wide, and two inches thick.  The \par
dominant color was slate gray, although there were some significant color \par
variations.  Some of the larger individual components must have been color-coded \par
according to some master plan.  Carol could identify groupings of similar \par
elements in red, yellow, blue, and white within the design.  The overall harmony \par
of the colors was striking, suggesting that some effort had been made by the \par
designers to include aesthetic considerations.\par
\tab Carol bent down on her knees beside the carpet and studied it more \par
intently.  Its surface was densely packed.  The closer she looked, the more \par
detail she found.  Extraordinary, she thought.  But what in the world is it?  \par
And how did it move?  Or could I possibly have imagined it?  She put her hand on \par
the exposed top surface.  She felt a soft tingle, like a gentle electric shock.  \par
She slid one hand under the edge and lifted slightly.  It was heavy.  She \par
removed her hand.\par
\tab Her desire to escape from this strange world now overruled her curiosity.  \par
Carol took a photograph of the carpet from the top and started walking away in \par
the direction of the window.  After several strides, she turned quickly to her \par
left to look at the carpet one more time.  It had moved again and was still even \par
with her in the room.  Carol continued walking toward the window, now watching \par
the carpet out of the corner of her eye.  When she had walked another ten feet, \par
her peripheral vision saw it arch up quickly along a line through its center, \par
pulling the rear of its body in a forward direction.  Half a second later the \par
front end of the carpet scooted forward and the center fell flat against the \par
floor again.  This maneuver was repeated six or eight times in rapid succession \par
as the carpet zipped up to a position even with Carol in the room.\par
\tab Despite her situation, Carol laughed.  She was still full of adrenaline \par
and uptight, but there was definitely something humorous about a multicolored \par
carpet that could crawl like an inchworm.  "Ha," Carol said out loud, "I caught \par
you.  Now you owe me an explanation."\par
\tab Carol certainly did not expect a reply to her comment.  Nevertheless, \par
after just a short delay, the behavior of the carpet was altered.  First it \par
began to generate small wave pulses along its surface, with four or five crests \par
from front to back.  After smartly reversing the direction of motion of the \par
waves several times, the carpet's next trick was to keep its front end fixed on \par
the floor, as if there were suction cups holding it down, and raise its back \par
side entirely off the floor.  In that mode it was about six feet tall.  It \par
seemed to be looking at Carol.\par
\tab She was flabbergasted.  "Well, I asked for it," she said out loud, still \par
amused by the antics of the carpet.  Now it seemed to be motioning for her to go \par
toward the window.  I have lost my mind, she thought to herself.  Completely.  \par
Troy was right.  Maybe we're dead.  The carpet arched over on the floor and \par
began to scamper toward the window, tumbling in somersaults like a slinky toy.  \par
Carol followed.  This is nuts, she thought as she watched the carpet move \par
somehow through the window and into the ocean.  And Alice thought she was in \par
Wonderland.\par
\tab The carpet was playing in the water, dodging fish as they swam by in \par
schools and teasing a sea urchin stuck fast against the reef.  At length it came \par
back into the room and stood upright.  A little water dripped on the floor when \par
the carpet set in motion a series of fast simultaneous waves, both latitudinal \par
and longitudinal, that effectively shook the residual liquid from its surface.  \par
It then faced Carol and clearly beckoned for her to go through the window into \par
the ocean\par
\tab "Look here, flat guy," she said, chuckling to herself as she tried to \par
figure out what to say.  Now I know I'm insane, she thought in a flash.  I'm \par
standing here talking to a carpet.  Next thing I know it will talk back.  "Now \par
I'm not stupid," she continued.  "I recognize that you're trying to get me to go \par
into the ocean.  But there are a few things that you don't \emdash  "\par
\tab The carpet interrupted the conversation by going quickly through the \par
window into the ocean again.  It performed a couple of flips and came back into \par
the room with Carol.  Once more it shook itself and then stood rigidly, upright \par
as before as if to say, "See, it's easy."\par
\tab "As I was saying," Carol began again, "I have perhaps gone crazy, but I'm \par
willing to trust that I can indeed go through that window in some magical way.  \par
My problem is that these is water out there.  I can't breathe in water.  Without \par
my diving gear, which I left somewhere in this labyrinth, I will die "\par
\tab The carpet didn't move.  Carol repeated her statement, using elaborate \par
hand gestures to make her key points.  Then she fell silent.  After a short wait \par
the carpet began to move about actively.  It then approached her carefully and \par
amazingly stretched itself out in all directions so that it was almost double \par
its original size.  Carol wasn't significantly fazed.  At this point she was \par
almost incapable of being astonished again.  Even by an elastic carpet that \par
pulled its two top sides together, over her head, to form a cone.\par
\tab Carol backed away a couple of steps from the now giant carpet.  "Oh ho," \par
she said, "I think I understand.  You are going to form an air pocket for me so \par
that I can breathe."  She stood still for a moment, thinking and shaking her \par
head.  "Why not," she said at last, "it's no weirder than anything else that's \par
happened."\par
\tab With the carpet hovering over and around her head, Carol closed her eyes \par
and walked directly toward the window.  She took a deep breath when she felt a \par
soft plastic touch on different parts of her body.  Suddenly the water was all \par
around her except for the small air pocket from the neck up.  It was hard for \par
Carol to keep her diving discipline, but she managed to equalize the pressure \par
every six to eight feet during her ascent.  She took one final breath and zoomed \par
up to the surface.  The carpet peeled off in the last foot before she broke \par
water.\par
\tab The Florida Queen was about fifty yards away.  "Nick," she shouted with \par
all her might, "Nick, over here."  She swam furiously toward the boat.  A wave \par
broke over her head.  The boat was again visible, she could see a figure in \par
profile.  He was looking over the side of the boat.  "Nick," Carol cried again \par
when she had gathered her strength.  This time he heard her and turned around.  \par
She waved her arms.\par
\par
\par
5\par
\par
NICK had followed Carol and Troy on the monitor right after their initial \par
descent, when they were still directly under the boat searching for the fissure.  \par
But he had quickly tired of watching them swim around in circles and had \par
returned to his deck chair to read his novel.  Afterward he had walked over to \par
the screen several more times to look for them and had seen nothing; Carol and \par
Troy had already left to investigate the area under the overhang.\par
\tab Nick had checked the monitor again after he had finished Madame Bovary.  \par
He had been a little surprised to discover that the fissure was again clearly \par
visible underneath the Florida Queen.  He next assumed that he must have been \par
correct, that it had just been a case of bad lighting, since with the sun \par
directly overhead, the hole in the reef looked much smaller to him than it had \par
two days before.  He had then busied himself about the boat until his wrist \par
alarm went off, indicating that Carol and Troy had about five more minutes of \par
air remaining.\par
\tab Nick walked over and looked at the images being taken by the ocean \par
telescope and placed in realtime on the screen.  There was no sign of Carol and \par
Troy under the boat.  Nick started becoming restive.  I hope they're paying \par
attention, he thought.  He realized that they had been gone from view for a long \par
time and that he had never seen them actually explore the fissure, their primary \par
goal.  A creeping disquiet began to spread through him as the clock continued to \par
run out.\par
\tab There's only one explanation, he thought, fighting against the negative \par
ideas that were filtering into his mind.  They have been gone a long time, so \par
they must have found something interesting at the overhang.  Or somewhere else.  \par
For just a moment Nick imagined that Carol and Troy had found a lode of \par
treasure, full of objects that looked like the strange trident they had \par
retrieved on Thursday.\par
\tab The second hand seemed to be racing on his watch.  It was now one minute \par
until they should run out of air.  Nick nervously checked the monitor again.  \par
Nothing.  He felt his heart speed up.  They must be in the red, he thought.  \par
Even if they have carefully conserved the air, they must be in the red.  Nick \par
worried for a second about a gauge failure, but he quickly remembered checking \par
both of them himself when he arrived at the boat that morning.  Besides, it's \par
terribly unlikely they would both fail .  .  .  so there must be trouble.\par
\tab Another minute passed and Nick realized that he had not formulated a plan \par
as to what he would do if they didn't show up.  His mind raced swiftly through \par
his options.  There were two distinctly different action patterns he could \par
follow.  He could put on his diving gear and go look for them along the trench \par
between the fissure and the overhang.  Or he could assume that, in their \par
excitement, Carol and Troy had simply neglected to check their air gauges \par
regularly and as a result had been forced to surface wherever they were when \par
they ran out of air.\par
\tab If I go down after them, he thought, I probably won't reach them in time.  \par
Nick had a moment of self-recrimination because he had not properly prepared for \par
this contingency.  It would take him several valuable minutes to put on and \par
check out his own diving apparatus.  That settles it.  I must assume they're \par
around here somewhere.  Floating on the surface.  He looked briefly at the \par
screen one more time and then walked over to the side of the boat.  He scanned \par
the ocean.  It was a little choppy now.  He didn't see any sign of them.\par
\tab Nick turned on the engine and pulled in the anchor.  He made a quick \par
mental assessment of the general direction to the overhang and started steering \par
with the engine at very low throttle.  Unfortunately, he could not see the \par
telescope monitor from the steering wheel, and the canopy blocked his vision \par
behind him.  Nick was in perpetual motion, back and forth from the wheel to the \par
screen to the sides of the boat.  As his fear and frustration began to build, so \par
did his anger.  It was now five minutes after the nominal time that their air \par
supply would have been depleted.\par
\tab Damnit, Nick thought, still not allowing his brain to nurture images of \par
disaster, How could they be so careless?  I knew I shouldn't have let them go as \par
a pair.  He continued to castigate himself and then turned on Carol.  I let that \par
woman push me\par
around.  I will sure as hell straighten her out when I find them.  Nick turned \par
the boat sharply to the left.\par
\tab He thought he heard a voice.  Nick ran to the side of the boat.  He had no \par
sense of what direction the shout had come from.  After two or three more \par
seconds he heard it again.  He turned and saw a figure wave.  Nick waved back \par
and went over to the steering wheel to change the direction of the boat.  He \par
pulled out a strong rope from the equipment drawer and tied it around one of the \par
stanchions next to the ladder.  He threw the line to Carol as the boat pulled up \par
alongside her and then he cut the motor back to idle.\par
\tab She had no trouble catching the line.  As he was reeling her in, Nick's \par
eyes searched the surrounding water for Troy.  He could not see him.  Carol had \par
now reached the ladder.  "You would not believe .  .  ."  she started, trying to \par
catch her breath as she put her first foot on the ladder.\par
\tab "Where's Troy?" interrupted Nick.  gesturing out at the ocean.\par
\tab Carol took another step up the ladder.  It was clear that she was \par
exhausted.  Nick took her hand and she came into the boat.  She stood up on her \par
wobbly legs.\par
\tab "Where's Troy?"  Nick asked again forcefully.  He looked at Carol.  "And \par
what happened to all your gear?"\par
\tab Carol took a deep breath.  "I .  .  .  don't know .  .  .  where Troy is," \par
she stammered.  "We were sucked down \emdash  "\par
\tab "You don't know!" shouted Nick, now frantically looking around on the \par
ocean surface.  "You go on a dive, come up without your gear, and don't know \par
where your partner is.  What kind \emdash  "\par
\tab A small wave hit the boat.  Carol had raised her hand to protest Nick's \par
diatribe, but the motion of the boat knocked her feet out from under her.  She \par
fell hard on her knees and winced at the pain.  Nick was hovering over her, \par
still shouting.  "Well, Miss Perfect, you better come up with some fucking \par
answers fast.  If we don't find Troy soon, he'll be dead.  And if he's dead, it \par
will be your goddamn fault."\par
\tab Carol instinctively cowered at the anger of the large man.  Her knees \par
hurt, she was exhausted, and this man was yelling in her face.  Suddenly her \par
emotions gave way.  "Shut up," she shouted.  "Shut up, you asshole.  And get \par
away from me."  She was flailing with her arms, hitting Nick on the legs and in \par
the stomach.  "You don't know anything," she said after taking a quick breath.  \par
"You don't know shit."\par
\tab Carol put her head in her hands and began to cry.  In that instant, a \par
long-buried memory burst upon her mind Her five-year-old brother was sobbing \par
hysterically and attacking her, pummeling her with his fists.  She had her hands \par
up to protect herself.  "It's your fault, Carol," he was screaming, "he left \par
because of you."  She remembered the hot tears in her eyes.  "It's not true, \par
Richie, it's not true.  It wasn't my fault."\par
\tab On the boat Carol glanced up through her tears at Nick.  He had backed \par
away and was looking sheepish.  She wiped her eyes and took a deep breath.  "It \par
was not my fault," Carol said deliberately and emphatically.  Nick stuck out his \par
hand to help her up and she smacked it away.  He mumbled "I'm sorry" as she rose \par
to her feet.  "Now if you'll just shut up and listen," she continued, "I'll tell \par
you what happened.  The reef under the boat wasn't a reef at all .  .  .  Oh, my \par
God .  .  .  It's here."\par
\tab Nick saw a look of consternation break on Carol's face.  She pointed over \par
behind him, on the other side of the boat.  He turned around to look.  At first \par
he didn't notice anything.  Then he saw a strange flat object that looked like a \par
piece of carpet inching along the boat toward the telescope monitor.  He screwed \par
up his face and turned back to Carol with a puzzled expression.\par
\tab While Carol had been talking, the carpet had somehow crawled up the side \par
and then flopped into the boat.  By the time she started to explain, it was \par
already standing in front of the television monitor, looking at the images the \par
telescope was taking of the ocean floor beneath the boat.  There was no time for \par
lengthy explanations.  "What the fuck?" Nick said, and walked over to apprehend \par
the peculiar visitor.  When his hand was about an inch away from touching the \par
carpet, he felt a strong electrical discharge in the end of his fingers.  "Ow!"  \par
he said, jumping back.  He shook his hand and watched with amazement.  The \par
carpet continued to stand in front of the screen.\par
\tab Nick looked at Carol as if he expected some assistance.  But she was \par
finding the whole scene amusing.  "That thing is just one of the reasons the \par
dive was strange," she said, making no effort to provide any help.  "But I don't \par
think it will hurt you.  It probably saved my life."\par
\tab Nick grabbed a small fishnet hanging on the side of the structure holding \par
up the canopy and slowly approached the carpet.  As he drew near, it seemed to \par
turn and look at him.  Nick lunged forward with the net.  The carpet dodged \par
deftly and Nick lost his balance.  He fell against the monitor with his arms \par
akimbo.  Carol laughed out loud, remembering the first time they met.  The \par
carpet flipped over to the telescope data system and wrapped itself tightly \par
around the entire set of electronic equipment.\par
\tab From the floor of the boat Nick watched the carpet investigating the data \par
system and shook his head in disbelief.  "What the hell is that thing anyway?" \par
he shouted to Carol.\par
\tab She came over and graciously offered a hand to help him up.  It was her \par
way of apologizing for her earlier outburst.  "I have no earthly idea," Carol \par
replied.  "At first I thought it might be a sophisticated Navy robot.  But it is \par
much too advanced, too intelligent."  She pointed at the sky with her free left \par
hand.  "They know," she said with a smile.\par
\tab The comment reminded Carol of Troy and she became solemn.  She walked over \par
to the side of the boat and stared at the ocean.  Nick was now standing up next \par
to the monitor within an arm's length of the carpet and the data system.  It \par
looked as if the carpet had somehow extended part of itself into the internal \par
electronics.  Nick watched for a few seconds, fascinated, as the various digital \par
diagnostic readouts on the top of the data system went crazy.  "Hey, Carol," he \par
said.  "Come here and look at this.  That damn thing is plastic or something."\par
\tab She did not turn around at first.  "Nick," Carol asked softly, finally \par
facing him, "what are we going to do about Troy?"\par
\tab "As soon as we get this damn invader out of here," Nick replied from \par
underneath the canopy, where he was now looking through his kitchen implements, \par
"we'll do a systematic search of the area.  I may even dive and see if I can \par
find him."\par
\tab Nick had picked up a large cooking fork with a plastic handle and was \par
about to attempt to pry the carpet off the data system.  "I wouldn't do that if \par
I were you," admonished Carol.  "He'll leave when he's ready."\par
\tab But it was too late.  Nick stuck the fork into and through the carpet and \par
up against the uppermost rack of electronic parts.  There was a popping sound \par
and a tiny blue arc zapped down the fork, driving Nick backward with a powerful \par
kick.  Alarms went off, the digital readout from the data system went blank, and \par
the ocean telescope monitor began to smoke.  The carpet dropped down on the \par
floor and began making the little waves that it had showed to Carol in the large \par
room with the window on the ocean.  A moment later, two alarms from the \par
navigation system sounded, indicating not only that the boat's current location \par
had been lost, but also that the nonvolatile memory, where all the parameters \par
that permitted satellite communication were stored, had been erased.\par
\tab In the middle of the noise and smoke, Nick stood with a puzzled expression \par
on his face.  He was rubbing his right arm from his wrist to his shoulder.  "I'm \par
numb," he said in astonishment.  "I can't feel anything in my arm."\par
\tab The carpet continued with its wave patterns on the floor of the boat while \par
Carol picked up a pail, leaned overboard for some water, and doused the monitor.  \par
Nick had not moved.  He was still standing there, looking helpless and pinching \par
his arm.  Carol threw the rest of the water on Nick.  "Shit," he sputtered, \par
backing up involuntarily, "why did you do that?"\par
\tab "Because we have to find Troy," she said, walking over to the boat's \par
controls.  "And we can't wait all day.  Ignore the damn carpet .  .  .  and your \par
arm.  A man's life is at stake."\par
\tab She increased the speed of the boat.  As she did, the carpet stood up \par
again, twisted around, and hustled to the side.  Nick tried to stop it but it \par
was out of the boat and into the water in a flash.  As Carol steered the boat \par
through circles of larger and larger radius, Nick stood on the side of the \par
Florida Queen and searched for Troy.\par
\par
\tab An hour later they both agreed there was no reason for them to continue \par
the search.  Carol and Nick had been over the entire region of the ocean in the \par
boat several times (with some care and difficulty, because they no longer had a \par
working navigation system) and had found no trace of Troy.  After he had \par
convinced himself that his arm was all right.  Nick had even donned his diving \par
equipment, as a last resort, and had retraced the path from the fissure to the \par
overhang and back.  Still no sign of Troy.  Nick had been just slightly tempted \par
to investigate the fissure, but Carol's wild story seemed remotely plausible, \par
and Nick did not like the idea of being sucked into some bizarre underground \par
laboratory.  And he knew that if he were to disappear, it would be virtually \par
impossible for Carol to guide the boat back to Key West without an active \par
navigation system.\par
\tab Carol recounted the whole story of her dive while she and Nick were \par
canvassing the area.  He was certain she was liberally embellishing the details, \par
but he could see no over-arching logical flaws in her tale.  And he himself had, \par
after all, confronted the carpet on the Florida Queen.  So he acknowledged, in \par
his own mind, that Carol and Troy had indeed had hair-raising experiences in an \par
underwater building of some type and that the technology they had encountered \par
was definitely more advanced than anything they had ever seen before\par
\tab But Nick was reluctant to accept Carol's blithe explanation that the trio \par
had met some extraterrestrials.  It didn't seem likely to Nick that a first \par
contact would be made under such mundane circumstances Although he readily \par
admitted that the carpet was a marvel of capability far beyond his ken, he did \par
not think of himself as being technologically sophisticated and therefore he \par
could not state, categorically, that human beings could not have created it.\par
\tab Infact, Nick thought to himself as he was carefully searching the horizon \par
with his binoculars for reference landmarks before beginning the trip back to \par
Key West, what a perfect deception.  Suppose the Russians or even our own Navy \par
wanted to mislead .  .  .  He stopped himself in mid-thought and realized that \par
if he were right, and their encounter had been with a human creation, then they \par
could very well still be in danger.  But why was Carol allowed to leave?  And \par
why didn't they confiscate my boat?  Nick found a small island that he \par
recognized off in the distance and changed the orientation of the boat.  He \par
shook his head.  It was all very confusing.\par
\tab "You don't agree with me that we've just met some ETs?"  Carol came up \par
beside Nick and slightly teased him with her question.\par
\tab "I don't know," he answered slowly.  "It seems like quite a leap to make.  \par
After all, if there is an extraterrestrial infestation in the waters of the Gulf \par
of Mexico, it should have been found before now.  Submarines and other boats \par
with active sonar must cross this region at least once or twice a year."  He \par
smiled at her.  "You've been reading too much science fiction."\par
\tab "On the contrary," she responded, fixing him with her gaze, "my experience \par
with state-of-the-art technology is almost certainly more extensive than yours.  \par
I have done a series of features on the Miami Oceanographic Institute and have \par
seen what kind of ingenious new concepts are being developed.  And nothing, \par
absolutely nothing, comes close to the carpet or the giant amoeba thing.  The \par
likelihood that there is some nonfantastic explanation for all this is very very \par
small."  She paused for a moment.  "Besides," she continued, "maybe the \par
laboratory hasn't been there for long.  Maybe it was just recently finished or \par
even transported here."\par
\tab Nick had felt himself bridle when Carol had started her comment.  There \par
she goes again, he had thought.  So sure of herself.  So cocky and competitive.  \par
Almost like a man.  He admitted to himself that he had also been known to make \par
arguments from authority.  And she was certainly right in one respect.  She had \par
had much more exposure to high technology than he had.  Nick decided not to \par
argue with her.  This time.\par
\tab There was a momentary pause in the conversation.  Carol was also becoming \par
more sensitive to the dynamic of their interaction.  She had noticed in realtime \par
that Nick's face had tightened when she had suggested that she knew more about \par
technology than he did.  Uh oh, had flashed through her mind.  Come on, Carol.  \par
Be a little more tactful and considerate.  She decided to change the subject.\par
\tab "How long will it take us to reach the marina?" she asked.  In her \par
excitement on Thursday afternoon, she had not paid much attention to time during \par
their return trip.\par
\tab "A little less than two hours," Nick replied.  He laughed.  "Unless I get \par
lost.  I haven't used manual guidance in these waters for over five years."\par
\tab "And what are you going to say when we get there?"\par
\tab Nick looked at her.  "To whom .  .  .  about what?" he asked.\par
\tab "You know.  About our dive.  About Troy."\par
\tab They stared at each other.  Nick finally broke the silence.  "My vote \par
would be to say nothing about it .  .  .  until .  .  . until we know for \par
certain," he said quietly.  "Then if Troy shows up, there's no problem."\par
\tab "And if he doesn't ever show up .  .  .  " Carol's voice trailed off, \par
"then we, Mr. Williams, are both in very deep shit."  The gravity of their \par
situation was becoming clear to both of them.\par
\tab "But who do you think will ever believe such an incredible tale?"  Nick \par
said after a moment.  "Even with your pictures, there's no really hard evidence \par
to corroborate our story.  These days people can create any kind of photo they \par
want on a computer.  Remember that murder case in Miami last year, where an \par
alibi photograph was produced and admitted as official evidence?  And then later \par
that data processor showed up and blew the whistle?"  He paused.  Carol was \par
listening intently.  "And whoever built that place may be dismantling it at this \par
very moment," he continued.  "Otherwise.  why did they let us get away?  No.  I \par
say we wait awhile.  Twenty-four hours or so anyway.  And think carefully about \par
what we're going to do."\par
\tab Carol nodded her head affirmatively.  "I think I agree with you, although \par
not exactly for the same reasons."  She was aware there was still a journalistic \par
voice inside her that wanted to guard the information for her sensational scoop.  \par
She hoped her ambition wasn't somehow standing in the way of making the right \par
decision for Troy.  "But Nick," Carol said reflectively, "you don't think we're \par
endangering Troy in any way by not contacting the authorities?"\par
\tab "No," Nick replied immediately.  "I suspect that if they were going to \par
kill him, they would have done so already.  Or will soon."\par
\tab This part of the conversation was too casual for Carol.  She walked over \par
to the edge of the boat and stared out at the sea again.  She thought of Troy \par
and their wild adventure after they were sucked into the fissure.  He had helped \par
her hang together.  No question about it.  His humor and wit had kept her from \par
falling apart.  And he may have well saved her life by deflecting the attention \par
of that thing.\par
\tab He was a warm, sensitive man underneath that funny exterior, she thought.  \par
Very aware.  He also seemed to be covering lots of pain.  From somewhere.  For a \par
moment Carol convinced herself that Troy was all right.  After all, they had \par
helped her to escape.  Then she wondered why she had never run into him again \par
down there.  A seed of doubt was planted in her mind.  She squirmed.  Damnit.  \par
We don't really know one way or the other.  It's uncertainty again.  I hate \par
uncertainty.  It's unfair.\par
\tab A profound sadness, a deep and disturbing feeling from the past, stirred \par
in Carol.  She felt helpless, without any control of the situation.  Tears \par
filled her eyes.  Nick had come up beside her without saying anything.  He saw \par
the tears in her eyes but didn't comment.  He just put his hand over hers for a \par
moment and then removed it.\par
\tab "Troy was becoming a good friend," Carol said, starting to hide what she \par
was really feeling.  All of a sudden her need to share her true emotions \par
overcame her normal protection mechanisms.  She looked down at the water.  "But \par
that's not really why I'm upset just now.  I'm crying because of the \par
uncertainty.  I can't stand not knowing."  Carol paused and wiped her eyes.\par
\tab Nick was quiet.  He did not understand exactly what she was saying, but he \par
sensed that something special was about to happen between them.  The gentle \par
waves lapped against the side of the boat.  "It reminds me of my childhood, \par
right after my father left," she continued softly.  "I kept believing that he \par
would be coming back.  All three of us, Richie, my mom, and I, would tell each \par
other that it was just a temporary separation, that someday he would walk \par
through the door and say 'I'm home.'  At night I would lie in my bed and listen \par
for the sound of his car in the driveway."\par
\tab The tears were flowing now, big drops cascading down her cheeks and \par
falling into the vast ocean.  "When he would come to pick us up for dinner, or \par
on a Saturday, I would help Mom fix herself up, choose her clothes for her, \par
brush her hair."  Carol choked up for a moment.  "After I hugged him at the \par
door, I would always take him to Mother and say, 'Isn't she beautiful?'\par
\tab "For six months this went on.  I never knew what I was going to feel from \par
day to day.  The uncertainty destroyed me, made me sick.  I begged my father to \par
give my mom one more chance.  Richie even suggested that he could buy the house \par
next door if he and Mother couldn't get along.  So we could at least all be \par
close together."  Carol smiled grimly and took a huge breath.\par
\tab "Then my father took my mother to San Francisco for the weekend.  I was so \par
excited.  For thirty-six hours my heart soared, my future was assured.  I was \par
the happiest ten-year-old girl in the San Fernando Valley.  But when they came \par
home un Sunday night my mother was very drunk.  Her eyes were swollen, her \par
mascara was running, she was a mess.  She marched right past Richie and me and \par
went to her room.  My dad, Richie, and I stood in the living room, all hugging, \par
and wept together.  In that instant I knew it was all over."\par
\tab Carol was calming down now but the tears were still there.  She looked at \par
Nick, her eyes entreating.  "It would have been so much easier if I could have \par
cried one time and been done with it.  But no.  There was uncertainty, so there \par
was still hope.  So every day, every goddamn day, my little heart was broken \par
again."  Carol wiped her eyes one more time.  Then she looked out at the ocean \par
and shouted with all her might, "I want to know now, or at least soon, what \par
happened to Troy!  Don't make me wait forever.  I can't take it."\par
\tab She turned to Nick.  He opened his arms.  Without a word she put the side \par
of her face against his chest.  He closed his arms around her.\par
\par
\par

\par
NICK reached above the door to Troy's duplex and found the key on the ledge.  He \par
knocked on the door again and opened it cautiously.  "Hello," he called out, "is \par
anybody there?"\par
\tab Carol followed him into the living room.  "I didn't know you two were such \par
close friends," she said, after she glanced with amusement at Troy's motley \par
collection of furniture.  "I don't think I've ever told anyone where I keep my \par
key."\par
\tab What Nick was looking for was not in the living room.  He walked down the \par
hallway, past the large bedroom with its storehouse of equipment, and into the \par
smaller bedroom where Troy slept.  "Actually," Nick yelled at Carol, who had \par
stopped behind him in the hall opposite the first bedroom and was gawking at the \par
jumble of electronics filling every conceivable cranny, "it was only yesterday \par
that I came over here for the first time.  So I don't really know where .  .  .  \par
oh, good, I think I've found something."  He picked up a sheet of computer \par
printout that was underneath a paperweight on the end table beside Troy's bed.  \par
It was dated January 15, 1994, and contained about twenty names, addresses, and \par
phone numbers.\par
\tab Nick met Carol in the hallway.  He read quickly through the page and \par
showed it to her.  "There's not much here.  Phone numbers and addresses for \par
electronics and software supply houses.  A bunch of numbers for Angie \par
Leatherwood, probably while she was still on tour."  He pointed at one entry.  \par
"This must be his mother, Kathryn Jefferson, in Coral Gables, Florida.  But \par
there's no phone number listed with the address."\par
\tab Carol took the sheet from Nick and checked it herself.  "I never heard him \par
mention anyone but Angie, his mother, and his brother Jamie.  No other friends \par
or family.  And I somehow have the impression that he hasn't seen much of his \par
mother recently.  Did you ever hear him say anything about any other family?"\par
\tab "No," Nick replied.  They had wandered together into the game room and \par
Nick was idly turning knobs and switches as he walked past the arrays of \par
equipment.  He stopped and thought for a moment.  "So that means Angie is the \par
one.  We'll tell her right away and then wait \emdash  "\par
\tab Carol and Nick both froze as they distinctly heard the front door open and \par
close.  After about a second, Nick called out in a loud but uncertain voice, \par
"Hello, whoever it is, we're back here in the bedroom."  There was no answer.  \par
They could hear soft footsteps in the hallway.  Nick instinctively moved over to \par
protect Carol.  A moment later Troy came around the corner and into the room.\par
\tab "Well, well," he said, grinning broadly, "as I live and breathe.  I have \par
found a pair of burglars in my home."\par
\tab Carol ran up to Troy and threw her arms around his neck.  "Troy," she \par
said, her comments coming in quick staccato bursts, "is it ever good to see you.  \par
Where have you been?  You scared the shit out of us.  We thought you were dead."\par
\tab Troy returned Carol's hug and winked at Nick.  "My, my.  Such a reception.  \par
I should have vanished before."  He extended a hand to shake the one that Nick \par
was offering him.  For a moment his face became serious.  "On second thought, \par
one experience like that is definitely enough."\par
\tab Carol backed away and Troy saw the computer sheet in her hand.  "We were \par
going to try to notify your family .  .  ." she started.  Troy reached out to \par
take the page and Carol noticed a bracelet on Troy's right wrist that she had \par
never seen before.  It was wide, almost an inch and a half, and looked as if its \par
twenty or so links had been made from flattened gold nuggets.  "Where did you \par
get this?"  Carol asked, holding his wrist up so that she could see the bracelet \par
more clearly.\par
\tab Nick was unable to restrain himself any longer.  Before Troy could answer \par
Carol's question, he jumped into the conversation.  "According to Carol," he \par
said, "you were last seen disappearing down a corridor in an underwater \par
laboratory.  With a six-foot amoeba in hot pursuit.  How the hell did you \par
escape?  We searched all over the area .  .  ."\par
\tab Troy held up his hands.  He was enjoying being the center of attention.  \par
"Friends, friends.  Wait a minute, will you?  I will tell you the story as soon \par
as I take care of the necessities of life."  He turned and walked into the \par
bathroom.  Nick and Carol heard a familiar sound.  "Get some beer out of the \par
refrigerator and go into the living room," Troy shouted from behind the closed \par
door.  "We might as well enjoy this part of it."\par
\tab Two minutes later Nick and Carol were sitting together on the large couch \par
in the living room.  Troy plopped into the chair opposite them just as Nick took \par
a huge swig from his beer.  "Once upon a time," Troy began with a mischievous \par
grin, "there was a young black named Troy Jefferson, who, while diving with his \par
friends, vanished for almost two hours in a strange building underneath the \par
ocean.  When he emerged from his underwater adventure, he was rescued by divers \par
from the United States Navy, who just happened to be in the area at the time.  \par
Soon thereafter young Troy was flown in a military helicopter back to Key West.  \par
There he was interrogated at length about why he was swimming in the Gulf of \par
Mexico, all by himself, ten miles from the nearest island.  An hour later he was \par
released without anyone believing any part of his story."  Troy looked back and \par
forth from Nick to Carol.  "Of course," he added, now more serious, "I didn't \par
tell them anything that really happened.  There's no way they would have \par
believed the truth."\par
\tab Carol was leaning forward on the couch.  "So the Navy picked you up.  Just \par
after we left."  She turned to Nick.  "They must have been following us for some \par
reason."  The missile must have been there after all, she thought to herself.  \par
But where did it go?  Did the Navy find it?  And how are they involved with this \par
crazy laboratory?  Nothing makes sense .  .  .\par
\tab "We spent over an hour looking for you."  Nick was saying.  He was feeling \par
remorseful because they had abandoned the search for Troy so quickly.  "It \par
didn't occur to me that you might still be down in that place, whatever it was, \par
and of course we couldn't hang around forever.  All of our electronics were \par
zapped by this funny carpet thing that came out of the sea.  So we lost all nav \par
\emdash  " He stopped in mid-sentence and looked at Troy.  "I'm sorry, friend."\par
\tab "Don't worry about it," Troy replied with a shrug, "I would have done the \par
same thing.  At least I now know that you have met one of the bizarre characters \par
in my story.  You didn't, by any chance, also meet one of the wardens did you?  \par
Great big globs of clear jelly, amoebalike, with little boxes in the middle and \par
removable rods hanging out all over the top?"\par
\tab Nick shook his head.  "Warden?"  Carol asked quickly, her brow knitted.  \par
"Why do you call that thing a warden?"\par
\tab Warden, sentinel, whatever," Troy answered.  "They told me the warden \par
things protect the principal cargo of the ship."  Troy stared into the blank \par
gazes of his friends.  "Which leads me back to the first question," he \par
continued.  "They gave me this bracelet.  It is some kind of two-way \par
communications device.  I couldn't begin to explain how it works, but I know \par
that they are listening and watching as well as transmitting messages to me.  \par
Only a few of which I understand."\par
\tab Carol was starting to feel overwhelmed again.  In her mind this already \par
complex situation had added a new dimension.  Hundreds of questions were \par
crowding into her brain and she could not decide which one to ask first.\par
\tab Meanwhile Nick stood up.  "Hold it a minute," he said, looking dubious and \par
just a little confused.  "Did I hear you right?  Did you say you were given a \par
communications bracelet by some extraterrestrials and then released into the \par
ocean?  And then the Navy picked you up and brought you back to Key West?  \par
Christ, Jefferson, you do have an imagination.  Save your creativity for that \par
computer game.  Please just tell us the truth."\par
\tab "I am," replied Troy.  "Really \emdash  "\par
\tab "What did they look like?"  Carol interrupted, her journalistic training \par
taking over.  She had pulled a small tape recorder, the size of a fountain pen, \par
out of her purse.  Troy reached over and switched it off."  For now, angel, " he \par
said, "this is strictly between us .  .  .  I don't think I saw any of them \par
anyway.  Just the wardens and the carpets.  And my guess is that they're just \par
robots, machines of some type.  Intelligent, yes, but controlled by something \par
else \emdash  "\par
\tab "Jesus," Nick interrupted, "you're serious."  He was becoming exasperated.  \par
"This is turning into the most amazing shaggy dog story that I have ever heard.  \par
Wardens, carpets, robots.  I am lost.  Who are they?  What are they doing in the \par
ocean?  And why have they given you a bracelet?"  He picked up one of the little \par
pillows on the couch and threw it across the room.\par
\tab Carol laughed nervously.  "Nick's not the only one feeling frustrated, \par
Troy.  I was with you down there and I must admit that I'm having a hard time \par
tracking your story.  Maybe we should stop interrupting and let you talk.  I've \par
told Nick what happened in that solar system room up until you ran out and the \par
thing or warden followed.  Start from there, if you would, and tell the story in \par
logical sequence."\par
\tab "I'm not sure there is such a thing as a logical sequence, angel," Troy \par
replied, echoing Carol's laugh.  "The whole episode defies logic altogether.  \par
The warden thing eventually trapped me in a blind alley and sort of anesthetized \par
me with one of its rods.  It was like I was dreaming, but the dreams were real.  \par
I remember a similar feeling, after a fistfight when I was a teenager.  I had a \par
small concussion then.  I knew that I was alive, but I was very very slow to \par
react.  Reality seemed toned down, out there in the distance somewhere.\par
\tab "Anyway, another warden character showed up, same kind of body but \par
different fixtures sticking in the jelly, and carried me to what I think was an \par
examination room.  I don't know exactly how long I was there.  I was stretched \par
out on the floor and touched by all kinds of instruments.  My brain felt as if \par
it were in superfast motion, but I don't recall any specific thoughts.  Some \par
images I do remember.  I relived my brother, Jamie, breaking through the line on \par
a trap play and going forty-five yards for a touchdown in the Florida state \par
championship.  Then the bracelet was put on my wrist and I had the distinct \par
impression that someone was talking to me.  Very quietly, perhaps even in a \par
foreign language, but every now and then I understood what was being said.\par
\tab "What they told me," Troy continued with an intense and distant expression \par
on his face, "was that what we call the laboratory is really a space vehicle \par
from another world.  And that it has crash-landed, in a sense, on the Earth to \par
allow time for some difficult repairs.  They, that is, whoever built the ship, \par
need help from us, from me and you, to obtain some of the specific items \par
necessary for the repairs.  Then they can continue on their journey."\par
\tab Nick was now sitting on the floor just opposite Troy.  Both Carol and he \par
were hanging on every word.  They sat in silence for almost thirty seconds after \par
Troy had finished.  "If this story is true," Nick finally spoke, "then we are \emdash  \par
"\par
\tab There was a loud knock at the door.  All three of them jumped.  Several \par
seconds later the knock repeated.  Troy went to the door and partially opened \par
it.\par
\tab "There you are, you little shit," Carol and Nick heard a gruff, angry \par
voice say.  Captain Homer Ashford pushed through the door.  He didn't see Nick \par
and Carol at first.  "We had a deal and you've welshed on it.  You have been \par
back two hours already .  .  ."\par
\tab Out of the corner of his eye, Captain Homer saw that there were other \par
people in the room.  He turned around to talk to Greta, who had not yet entered \par
the house.  "Guess what?"  he said.  "Nick Williams and Miss Dawson are also \par
here.  No wonder we couldn't find her at the hotel."\par
\tab Greta followed Homer into the living room.  Her clear, expressionless eyes \par
spent no more than one second staring at each of the trio.  Carol thought she \par
saw just a trace of disdain in Greta's look, but she wasn't certain.  Homer \par
turned to Carol, the tone in his voice markedly more civil.  "We saw you two \par
return from your excursion around two o'clock," he said with a fake smile.  "But \par
somehow we missed Troy."  He winked at Carol and turned to Nick.  "Find any more \par
exciting trinkets today, Williams?"\par
\tab Nick had never made any attempt to hide the fact that he did not like \par
Captain Homer.  "Why of course, Captain," he answered, sneering the epithet, \par
"would you believe we found a veritable mountain of gold and silver bars?  \par
Looked like that Santa Rosa stack we had on the boat one afternoon, must be \par
about eight years ago.  Remember?  That was before Jake and I let you and Greta \par
unload it."\par
\tab Homer's voice had a nasty edge to it.  "I should have sued you for \par
slander, Williams.  That would have shut your loud mouth once and for all.  You \par
had your day in court.  Now knock off the crap, or one day you'll have more \par
trouble than you can handle."\par
\tab While Nick and Homer were trading insults and threats, Greta was strutting \par
around the living room as if she were in her own house.  She seemed to be \par
oblivious to the conversation and even to the presence of the other people in \par
the room.  She was wearing a tight white muscle shirt and a pair of navy blue \par
shorts.  When Greta walked, she carried her arms high, her back straight, and \par
her breasts erect.  Carol was intrigued by her behavior.  She watched Greta stop \par
and sort through Troy's compact discs.  Greta pulled out the disc with the cover \par
picture of Angie Leatherwood and licked her lips.  This pair belongs in a kinky \par
novel, Carol thought, as she overheard Troy tell Captain Homer that he was busy \par
this afternoon but would get back to him later.  What's their story? wondered \par
Carol.  And where does fat Ellen fit in?  Carol remembered that she was \par
scheduled to interview the three of them later in the evening.  But I'm not sure \par
that I really want to find out.\par
\tab "We were calling to tell you to bring your swimming suit tonight," Captain \par
Homer was addressing Carol.  She had missed the first part of his statement \par
while she was watching Greta parade around the room.\par
\tab "Pardon me," she said politely.  "Could you repeat what you just said?  \par
I'm afraid I had drifted away for a few seconds."\par
\tab "I said that you should come early, about eight o'clock."  Homer replied.  \par
"And bring your suit.  We have a most interesting and unusual pool."\par
\tab During this exchange, Greta walked up behind Nick and quickly reached both \par
arms around him.  With everyone else in the room watching, she lightly twisted \par
his nipples through his polo shirt and laughed when he jumped.  "You always did \par
like that, ya, Nikki," she said, releasing him after an instant.  Carol saw \par
anger flash in Homer's eyes.  Nick started to say something but Greta had \par
already walked out the front door before he could register a protest.\par
\tab "Be sure to call me when you're through here, Homer said to Troy after an \par
embarrassing silence.  "We need to straighten out a few things."  The older man \par
turned around, awkwardly, and without additional comment followed Greta toward \par
his Mercedes parked in front of Troy's house.\par
\tab "Now where were we?" said Troy abstractedly, as he closed the door behind \par
Homer and Greta.\par
\tab "You," said Nick with emphasis, "were telling us an amazing story and had \par
almost reached the punch line, where you were going to tell us what we could do \par
to help some aliens who landed here on Earth to repair their space vehicle.  But \par
first I, for one, would like some explanations.  I don't know if I believe any \par
of this wild fairy tale you're telling us, but I will admit that it is extremely \par
creative.  What concerns me at this minute, however, is not the issue of \par
creatures from another world.  It's those two real-life sleazebag human beings \par
who just left.  What did they want?  And are they somehow involved in our \par
current adventure?"\par
\tab "Just a minute, Nick," Carol intervened.  "Before we become sidetracked, I \par
would like to know what kind of help these ETs of Troy's want from us.  A \par
telephone?  A new spaceship?  Let's find this out now and talk about Homer and \par
your girlfriend Greta later."  Her reference to Greta was light and playful.  \par
Nick accepted it with good humor and feigned a wound.  Then he nodded his assent \par
to Carol's suggestion.  Troy pulled a sheet of paper from his pocket and took a \par
deep breath.\par
\tab "Now you guys must understand that I'm not yet absolutely certain that I \par
am properly receiving all their messages.  But this particular transmission, \par
where they list the things they need from us, is repeated every half hour.  My \par
interpretation of it hasn't changed for the last ninety minutes, so I'm fairly \par
certain that I have it right.  It's a long list and of course I don't pretend to \par
comprehend why they want all this stuff.  But I am certain you will both find it \par
very interesting."\par
\tab Troy started reading from his handwritten list.  "They want an English \par
dictionary and grammar, plus the same thing for four other major languages; an \par
encyclopedia of plant and animal life; a compact world history; a statistical \par
tract defining the current political and economic status of the world; a \par
comparative study of the world's major existing religions; complete issues \par
covering the last two years of at least three significant daily newspapers; \par
summary journals of science and technology, including surveys of weapon systems \par
both deployed and under development; an encyclopedia of the arts, preferably \par
including video and sound where appropriate; forty-seven pounds of lead; and \par
fifty-eight pounds of gold."\par
\tab Nick whistled when Troy was finished.  At Carol's request, Troy handed the \par
sheet to her and Nick read it another time over her shoulder, absorbing every \par
item.  Neither of them said anything.  "Believe it or not," Troy added as an \par
afterthought about a minute later, "the first eight items are not too difficult \par
to obtain.  I stopped by the Key West Public Library on the way home from the \par
marina and, for a fee, they are preparing for me a set of compact discs that \par
contain virtually all of the requested information.  The difficult items are at \par
the end of the list.  That's where your help is needed."\par
\tab Troy stopped for a second to see if Nick and Carol were following him.  \par
"Just to make certain I understand."  Nick was now walking slowly around the \par
room with the list in his hand, "what you want, or they want if you will, is for \par
us to return to their laboratory or vehicle or whatever it is with all this \par
information plus the lead and gold?"  Troy nodded.  "But fifty-eight pounds of \par
gold?  That's about a million dollars' worth.  Where would we get it?  And what \par
would they do with it anyway?"\par
\tab Troy acknowledged that he didn't know the answers to those questions.  \par
"But I have the feeling," he added, "again based upon what I think they are \par
telling me, that partially satisfying their needs will make their task that much \par
easier.  So I guess we do what we can and hope that it's enough."\par
\tab Nick shook his head back and forth.  "You know, Carol," he said as he \par
handed the list back to her, "never in my wildest flights of imagination could I \par
have concocted such an intricate and crazy scheme.  This entire thing is so \par
unbelievable and fantastic that it just begs to be accepted.  It's pure genius."\par
\tab Troy smiled.  "So you will help after all?" he asked.\par
\tab "I didn't say that," answered Nick.  "I still have lots of questions.  And \par
of course I can't speak for Miss Dawson.  But somehow, even if it's all make \par
believe, the idea of playing the good Samaritan for an extraterrestrial ship is \par
very appealing."\par
\par
\tab During the next half hour both Carol and Nick questioned Troy extensively.  \par
Troy dismissed Homer and Greta in a hurry, simply stating that he had agreed on \par
Thursday night to keep them informed about what was happening onboard the \par
Florida Queen in exchange for a short-term loan.  He also indicated that he \par
never intended to really give them any information, but that was all right \par
because they were crooks anyway.  Nick was not completely satisfied with Troy's \par
explanation.  He felt that he was not being told the whole truth.\par
\tab In fact, the more questions he asked, the more doubt there was in Nick's \par
mind about the entire story Troy was telling.  But what are the other options?  \par
Nick thought to himself.  I have seen that carpet with my own eyes.  If it is \par
not an ET, or at least made by one, then it must be a very advanced robot \par
designed by us or the Russians.  As he continued to question Troy, Nick's facile \par
mind began to construct an alternative scenario, admittedly wild and improbable, \par
but one that nevertheless explained all the events of the previous three days in \par
a way that Nick found just as reasonable as Troy's crazy story about the alien \par
space vehicle.\par
\tab Suppose somehow Troy and that turd Homer are working with the Russians.  \par
And this entire thing is just an elaborate cover for a rendezvous where illegal \par
information will be passed.  Homer would do anything for money.  But why would \par
Troy do it?  Having Troy participate in a scheme to sell U.S.  secrets to a \par
foreign country was the acknowledged weakness in Nick's alternative explanation, \par
but he rationalized it by convincing himself that perhaps Troy needed a lot of \par
extra money to pay for all the electronic equipment in his computer game.\par
\tab He certainly couldn't have saved enough money from his paltry salary, Nick \par
continued thinking.  So suppose these computer discs of Troy's have secret \par
military data instead of all that crazy information he just listed.  Then the \par
gold could this payoff .  Or someone else's.  Nick asked several more questions \par
about the gold.  Troy admitted he did not understand very well what they were \par
telling him, through the bracelet, about why they needed the lead and the gold.  \par
He just mumbled something about those two elements being difficult to produce by \par
transmutation and then added nothing else.\par
\tab For her part, Carol grew more and more convinced that the story Troy was \par
telling was true.  His inability to answer all the questions did not disturb \par
her; as a matter of fact, given the rather fantastic nature of his story, if he \par
had had pat answers to all the questions, she would have felt less assured of \par
its truth.  Despite her critical journalistic background, she found herself \par
intrigued and a little enchanted by the idea that some superaliens from another \par
world needed her help.\par
\tab Carol's intuition was just as important as her rational thought processes \par
in the formation of her opinion.  First of all, she trusted Troy.  She watched \par
him very carefully when he answered the questions and did not see the slightest \par
indication that he was lying.  She had no doubt that Troy believed he was \par
telling the truth.  But whether Troy was indeed telling the truth, or was \par
instead being manipulated and directed by the very ETs that he was purporting to \par
represent, was another issue altogether.  But for what purpose? she reasoned.  \par
There's not much that the three of us can do for them.  Even the information \par
they requested, except for the weapons stuff, is relatively innocuous.  She \par
temporarily set aside the notion that her friend Troy had become some kind of \par
pawn for the aliens.\par
\tab Carol could tell that Nick was growing more suspicious.  Nick thought it \par
was very peculiar that there were three Navy divers in the water at the exactly \par
correct location when one of the carpets ushered Troy to the surface.  And \par
Troy's report of the interrogation process after they had flown him to Key West \par
was so confused that Nick became exasperated again.\par
\tab "Christ, Jefferson," he said, "you either have a very short or a very \par
convenient memory.  You tell us that the Navy kept you in custody for almost an \par
hour, yet you hardly remember any of their questions and have no idea why they \par
were interrogating you.  That just doesn't sound right to me."\par
\tab Troy was becoming a little angry.  "Shit, Nick, I told you that I was \par
tired.  I had been through a traumatic experience.  Their questions didn't make \par
sense to me.  And the entire time I felt as if a little voice was trying to make \par
itself heard inside my head."\par
\tab Nick turned to Carol.  "I think I'm changing my mind.  I don't want to \par
play in this game, no matter how clever it is.  Homer and Greta annoy me, but I \par
can deal with them if it's necessary.  On the other hand, the Navy scares me.  \par
There was some reason they were following us.  It's just too damn unlikely to be \par
a coincidence.  Maybe Troy knows something about it and maybe he doesn't.  I \par
can't tell.  But I don't like the smell of it."\par
\tab He stood up to leave.  Carol motioned for Nick to sit down and took a deep \par
breath.  "Look, you two," she said in a low voice.  "I have a confession to \par
make.  And it seems as if this is the perfect time to make it I did not come \par
down here to Key West to look for whales."  She glanced at Nick.  "And not for \par
treasure either.  I came here to check out a rumor that a new Navy missile had \par
gone astray and crashed in the Gulf of Mexico."  She paused several seconds to \par
let her message register.  "I probably should have told you earlier.  But I \par
never found the right time.  I'm truly sorry."\par
\tab "And you thought the missile was in the fissure," said Troy a few seconds \par
later.  "Which was why you came back yesterday."\par
\tab "We were going to salvage it for you and give you a worldwide scoop," \par
added Nick, his feeling of betrayal softened somewhat by the obvious sincerity \par
of her apology.  "You were using us all the time."\par
\tab "You could call it that," Carol conceded, "but as a reporter, I don't see \par
it that way."  She noticed the tension in the room.  Nick seemed especially \par
guarded.  "But now it doesn't matter anyway," she continued.  "What is important \par
is that I have given an explanation for the Navy's presence at the dive site.  \par
During the last two days I have made several inquiries at all levels about the \par
clandestine activities that the Navy currently has underway to search for the \par
missile.  Last night that Mexican lieutenant got a good look at our best close-\par
ups of the missile in the fissure.  Undoubtedly someone put two and two \par
together."\par
\tab "Look, angel," Troy spoke after another short silence, "I don't know \par
anything about a missile.  And too much is going on for me to be hurt because \par
you lied to me.  I'm sure you had your reasons.  What I need to know now is \par
whether or not you will help me take this stuff back to the ETs or aliens or \par
whatever you want to call them."\par
\tab Before Carol could answer, Nick stood up again and started walking toward \par
the door.  "I'm very hungry," he announced, "and I want to think through this \par
entire situation.  If you don't mind, Troy, I'll have an early supper and meet \par
you later on tonight with my answer."\par
\tab Carol realized that she also was extremely hungry.  It had been a long, \par
exhausting day and she had not eaten anything significant since breakfast.  She \par
was also a little concerned about Nick's response to her confession.  "Why don't \par
I join you for a bite?" she said to Nick.  He gave a noncommittal shrug, as if \par
to say suit yourself.  Carol gave Troy a hug.\par
"Let's all meet at my room in the Marriott around seven-thirty.  I have to go \par
there anyway to dress for my interview with the triple creeps.  You guys can \par
give me some pointers."\par
\tab Her humor did not lighten the atmosphere in the room.  Troy was clearly \par
worried about something.  His face was very earnest, almost stern.  "Professor," \par
he said to Nick in a soft and deliberate monotone, "I know I didn't have all the \par
answers to your questions.  I don't even have the answers to my own.  But I do \par
know one thing for certain.  Nothing like this has ever happened on the Earth \par
before.  At least not in recorded history.  The creatures who built that \par
spaceship are, when compared to us, as we would appear to the ants or the bees \par
if they could comprehend us.  They have asked the three of us for help in \par
repairing their vehicle.  To say that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity \par
would be a colossal under-statement.\par
\tab "It would be great if we could sit around and debate this issue for weeks \par
or even months.  But we can't.  Time is running out.  The Navy is certain to \par
find them soon, maybe they have already, with possibly dire circumstances for \par
the human beings on this planet.  They have made it clear to me that their \par
mission must be fulfilled, that they must repair their vehicle and continue \par
their voyage, even if they must interfere with the Earth system to achieve their \par
goal.\par
\tab "I know all this sounds incredible, maybe even absurd.  But I am going to \par
collect some lead weights from my diver friends and pick up the compact discs at \par
the library.  With or without your help, I want to be over their spaceship at \par
dawn tomorrow."\par
\tab Nick studied Troy very carefully during this speech.  For an instant in \par
the middle, it seemed as if it were not Troy speaking at all, but someone or \par
something else speaking through him.  An eerie chill raced down Nick's spine.  \par
Shit, he thought.  I'm as bad as they are.  I'm now caught up in this thing too.  \par
He gestured to Carol to follow him and walked out the door.\par
\par
7\par
\par
\tab As I have told you twice before?" the voice sounded tired and bored, "I \par
was out diving with my friends, Nick Williams and Carol Dawson.  She had a \par
problem with her equipment and decided to make a quick return to the boat.  We \par
had found a particularly interesting reef, with some very unusual features, and \par
we weren't certain we would be able to locate it again.  So I decided to stay \par
and wait for her to come back.  When I finally surfaced half an hour later, \par
there was no sign of them or the boat."\par
\tab The recorder clicked off.  The two lieutenants stared at each other.  \par
"Shit, Ramirez, do you believe that bastard's story?  Any part of it?"  The \par
other man shook his head.  "Then why the hell did you let him go?  That black \par
shitass sat there for an hour, making fools out of us with ridiculous answers to \par
our questions.  and then you summarily released him."\par
\tab "We can't detain someone without positive evidence of wrong doing," \par
responded Ramirez, as if he were quoting from a military manual.  "And swimming \par
in the ocean ten miles from the nearest island, although strange, does not \par
constitute wrong doing." Ramirez could see that his colleague was scowling.  \par
"Besides, he never slipped up.  He always told exactly the same story."\par
\tab "The same bullshit, you mean."  Lieutenant Richard Todd leaned back in his \par
chair.  The two men were sitting around a small conference table in an old room \par
with white plaster walls.  The tape recorder was on the table in front of them \par
next to an empty ashtray.  "He didn't even believe his own story.  He just sat \par
there, that cocky grin on his black face, knowing that we couldn't charge him \par
with anything."  Todd put all four of his chair legs back on the floor and \par
pounded the table for emphasis.  "An experienced diver would never stay down by \par
himself for five minutes, much less thirty.  Too many things could go wrong.  As \par
for his friends, why the hell did they leave him?"  Now Todd stood up and made \par
gestures in the air with his hands.  "I'll tell you why, Lieutenant.  Because \par
they knew he was all right, that he had been picked up by a Russian submarine.  \par
Shit, I told you we should have taken one of the new vessels.  We probably could \par
have spotted the sub with the upgraded electronic gear."\par
\tab Ramirez was playing idly with the glass ashtray while Todd was giving his \par
lecture.  "You really believe that those three are involved with the Russians in \par
this, don't you?  It sure seems farfetched to me."\par
\tab "Fucking A," replied Todd, "nothing else makes even a tittle sense.  Every \par
engineer we have talked to says there are no conceivable failures that are \par
consistent both with the observed behavior of the missile and the telemetry we \par
received at our tracking stations.  So the Russians must have commanded it off \par
course."\par
\tab Todd grew excited as he explained the rest of the plot.  "The Russians \par
knew they would need some local help to find the exact location of the missile \par
in the ocean, so they hired Williams and crew to search for the bird and then \par
tell them where it was.  They planned to pick it up with one of their subs.  \par
Adding that Dawson woman to their team was a master stroke; her inquiries have \par
slowed down our own search by making us more concerned about the press."\par
\tab Lieutenant Ramirez laughed.  'You always sound convincing, Richard.  But \par
we still do not have even one shred of evidence.  I don't believe Troy \par
Jefferson's story any more than you do, but there could be many reasons why he \par
lied, only one of which is any of our business.  Besides, there still is a \par
fundamental problem with your explanation.  Why would the Russians go to all \par
this trouble just to seize a Panther missile?"\par
\tab "You and I and even Commander Winters may not know the true story of the \par
Panther missile," Todd countered quickly.  "It may be designed to carry some new \par
breakthrough weapon that we haven't even heard about.  It's not all that unusual \par
for the Navy to represent a project falsely and to keep its true purpose \par
hidden."  He stopped to think.  "But what's motivating the Russians is not that \par
important to us.  We have evidence of a conspiracy here.  Our job is to stop \par
it."\par
\tab Ramirez did not reply right away.  He continued to push the ashtray around \par
on the table.  "I guess I no longer view it that way," he said at length, gazing \par
directly at Todd.  I see no substantial evidence of any conspiracy.  Unless \par
Commander Winters himself orders additional work from my department, I am \par
abandoning my investigation." He looked at his watch.  "At least I can still \par
spend Saturday night and Sunday with my family." He rose to leave.\par
\tab "And what if I bring you proof?"  Todd asked, making no effort to hide his \par
disgust with Ramirez.\par
\tab "Proof will convince Winters as well," Ramirez answered coldly.  "I have \par
taken enough risk on this project.  I will not take any more action unless \par
instructed by the proper authority."\par
\par
\tab Winters wasn't really certain he would find something appropriate.  \par
Ordinarily, he carefully avoided shopping malls, especially on a Saturday \par
afternoon.  But while he had been lying on the couch, watching one of the NCAA \par
basketball games and sipping a beer, he had remembered how pleased he had been \par
when Helen Turnbull, who had played Maggie, had given him a set of unusual tile \par
coasters after the opening weekend of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.  "It's a fading \par
tradition in the theater, I fear," the experienced actress had said when he \par
thanked her, "but giving small presents after the opening night or nights is \par
still my way of congratulating those people I have enjoyed working with."\par
\tab The mall was crowded with Saturday shoppers and Commander Winters felt \par
oddly conspicuous, as if everyone were looking at him.  He walked around for \par
several minutes before he even thought about what kind of gift he might get for \par
her.  Something simple of course, he thought.  Nothing that could be \par
misinterpreted.  Just a nice memento or souvenir.  He saw Tiffani in his mind's \par
eye as she had appeared in his fantasy just before he had fallen asleep the \par
night before.  The image embarrassed him in the shopping crowd and he nervously \par
called up another picture, this one wholesome and acceptable, of the little girl \par
Tiffani during his conversation with her father.  Her hair, he thought, \par
remembering the pigtails.  I'll buy her something for her hair.\par
\tab He walked into a gift shop and tried to make some sense out of the jumble \par
of bric-a-brac that lined the walls and was assembled on top of an assortment of \par
tables in no identifiable pattern.  "Can I help you?"  Winters jumped when a \par
salesgirl approached him from behind.  He shook his head.  Now why did you do \par
that? he said to himself.  Of course you need help.  Otherwise you'll never find \par
anything.\par
\tab "Excuse me, young lady," he almost shouted at the retreating salesgirl, "I \par
guess I could use some advice.  I want to buy a present." Winters again felt as \par
if everyone were watching him.  "For my niece," he added quickly.\par
\tab The salesgirl was a brunette, about twenty, very plain, but with an eager \par
face.  "Did you have anything in mind?" she asked.  Her hair was long, like \par
Tiffani's.  Winters relaxed a little.\par
\tab "Sort of," he said.  "She has beautiful long hair.  Like yours.  What \par
could I get her that would be really special?  It's her birthday."  Again he \par
felt a strange anxiety that he did not understand.\par
\tab "What color?" the girl asked.\par
\tab The question didn't make sense.  "I don't even know yet what I want," he \par
replied with a puzzled expression, "so I certainly don't know the color."\par
\tab The salesgirl smiled.  "What color is your niece's hair?" she said very \par
slowly, almost as if she were speaking to a mental retard.\par
\tab "Oh, of course," Winters laughed.  "Reddish-brown, auburn," he said.  "And \par
it's very long." You said that already, a voice whispered inside of him.  You \par
are acting like a fool.\par
\tab The salesgirl motioned for him to follow her and they walked back to the \par
rear of the store.  She pointed at a small round glass case full of combs of all \par
shapes and sizes.  "These would make excellent gifts for your niece," she said.  \par
There was an inflection in her voice when she said the word "niece" that \par
bothered Winters.  Could she know something?  One of her friends?  Or maybe she \par
was at the play?  He took a breath and calmed himself.  Again Winters was \par
astounded by the volatility of his emotions.\par
\tab On one of the small shelves were two beautiful matching brown combs with \par
gold filigree across the top.  One of the combs was large enough to hold all \par
that magnificent hair in a chignon against her neck.  The other smaller comb was \par
a perfect size to adorn the side or back of her hairstyle.  "I'll take those," \par
he said to the girl, "the ones with the gold work along the top.  And please \par
giftwrap them for me."\par
\tab The efficient salesgirl reached inside the display case and pulled out the \par
combs.  She told Winters to wait a couple of minutes while she wrapped the \par
present.  She disappeared into the back of the store and winters was left alone.  \par
I'll leave them on her dressing table at the end of intermission, he was \par
thinking.  He conjured up a picture of Tiffani going into the dressing room, by \par
herself, and finding the present under her nameplate against the mirror.  \par
Winters smiled as he imagined her reaction.  At that moment a woman with her \par
eight- or nine-year-old daughter brushed by him in the store.  "Pardon me," the \par
woman said, without looking around, as she and the little girl rushed to finger \par
some Easter baskets hanging on the wall.\par
\tab The salesgirl had finished wrapping the present and was standing next to \par
the computer cash register.  When Winters reached the counter, she handed him a \par
small card that had "Happy Birthday" imprinted on the upper left corner.  \par
Winters stared at it for a few seconds.  "No," he said finally.  "No card.  I'll \par
buy another at the stationery store."\par
\tab "Cash or charge?" the girl asked him.\par
\tab Winters panicked for a moment.  I don't know if I have enough cash on me, \par
he thought.  And how would I ever explain the charge to Betty?  He opened his \par
wallet and counted his money.  He smiled at the girl and said "Cash, please" \par
when he realized that he had almost fifty dollars.  The bill was only thirty-two \par
dollars, including the tax.\par
\tab Commander Winters felt a rush of Joy as he nearly skipped out of the \par
store.  His earlier nervousness had completely disappeared.  He even began to \par
whistle just before he pushed open the door and left the enclosed air-\par
conditioned environment of the mall.  I hope she likes the combs, he said to \par
himself.  Then he smiled again.  I know she will.\par
\par

NICK poured the last of the bottle of Chablis into Carol's glass.  "I don't \par
think I could ever be a journalist," he said.  "To be successful it sounds to me \par
as if you have to be a sneak."\par
\tab Carol moved a piece of broiled catfish mixed with some cauliflower onto \par
her fork and put the bite in her mouth.  "It's not that much different from any \par
other job.  There are always questions of ethics, as well as places where your \par
personal and professional lives come into conflict.  " She finished chewing her \par
food and swallowed before she continued.  "I had thought that maybe I would tell \par
you and Troy on Friday evening.  But things just didn't work out, as you know."\par
\tab "If you had," Nick pushed his plate away to indicate that he was finished \par
with his meal, "then everything would have been different.  I would have been \par
aware of the possible danger and most likely it would have been you and I in \par
that place together.  Who knows what might have happened then."\par
\tab "I've had worse conflicts before." Carol took a drink from her glass of \par
wine.  She wanted to finish with this subject.  In her way.  "Right after I \par
graduated from Stanford, I worked for the San Francisco Chronicle.  I was dating \par
Lucas Tipton a little at the time that the Warrior drug scandal broke.  I used \par
the social contacts I had made through him to obtain a unique slant on the \par
story.  Lucas never forgave me.  So I'm used to problems.  They go with the \par
territory."\par
\tab A waiter came by and poured them some coffee.  "But now that I have \par
finished apologizing, for the third time," Carol said pointedly, "I hope we can \par
go back to more important matters.  I must tell you, Nick, that I find your \par
Russian plot idea absolutely off the wall.  The weakest element is Troy.  \par
There's simply no way he could be a spy.  It's preposterous."\par
\tab "More preposterous than a super-alien space vehicle in need of repairs at \par
the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico?"  Nick  countered stubbornly.  "Besides, I \par
have a definite motive.  Money.  Did you see all the equipment he has wrapped up \par
in that computer game?"\par
\tab "Angie probably makes enough off her royalties in one week to cover all \par
that computer stuff," Carol replied.  She reached across the table and put her \par
hand on Nick's forearm.  "Now don't overreact, but you know there are some \par
relationships where the woman carries the financial load.  I can tell that she \par
loves him.  There's no doubt in my mind that she would offer to help him."\par
\tab "Then why did he try to borrow money from me and then Captain Homer on \par
Thursday night?"\par
\tab "Hell, Nick, I don't know."  Carol was becoming slightly frustrated.  "But \par
it's irrelevant anyway.  I can't imagine any set of conditions, unless I was \par
convinced that I was going to be killed, that would prevent my going back out \par
there with Troy.  Whatever the truth is, it is certainly a sensational story.  \par
I'm surprised you are so hesitant.  I thought you were an adventurer."\par
\tab Carol stared directly across the table at Nick.  He thought he saw a \par
flicker of flirtation hiding behind her unwavering gaze.  You are one \par
fascinating woman, he thought.  And you're taunting me a little now.  I caught \par
your double meaning.  He remembered how good he had felt when he held her on the \par
boat in the afternoon.  Underneath that aggressive veneer is another person.  \par
Beautiful and intelligent.  Hard as nails one minute and a vulnerable little \par
girl the next.  Nick was certain that any hope he might have of continuing his \par
relationship with Carol was dependant on his helping Troy.  She wasn't \par
interested in men who were not willing to take chances.\par
\tab "I used to be," Nick finally replied.  He twirled his empty wine glass in \par
his hand.  "I don't know what happened.  I guess I got stung a couple of times \par
and that has made me more cautious.  Particularly where people are concerned.  \par
But I will admit that if I stand back from this situation and imagine myself as \par
simply an observer, I find the whole affair absolutely fascinating."\par
\tab Carol finished her wine and put the glass back on the table.  Nick was \par
quiet.  She drummed her fingers on the tabletop and smiled.  "Well," she said, \par
fixing him with her eyes and picking up her coffee cup, "have you made a \par
decision?"\par
\tab He laughed.  "Okay.  Okay.  I'll do it."  Now it was his turn to reach out \par
and touch her arm.  "For lots of reasons."\par
\tab "Good," she remarked.  "Now that something has been decided, why don't you \par
help me prepare for my interview with Captain Homer and the crew.  How much was \par
the stuff worth that you pulled up from the Santa Rosa?  And who was Jake?  I \par
must act as if I'm serious about this story." Carol put her fountain pen tape \par
recorder on the table and turned it on.\par
\tab "We officially cleared a little over two million dollars.  Jake Lewis and \par
I each received ten percent, Amanda Winchester was reimbursed for the expense \par
advance plus twenty-five percent of the profit.  Homer, Ellen and Greta kept the \par
rest."  Nick stopped but Carol indicated for him to continue.  "Jake Lewis was \par
the only close friend I have ever had as an adult.  He was an absolute peach of \par
a person, honest, hard-working, intelligent, and loyal.  And completely naive.  \par
He fell for Greta like a ton of bricks.  She manipulated him completely and then \par
used his love to her own advantage."\par
\tab Nick looked away, out the window of the small seafood restaurant, at some \par
seagulls who were soaring over the water in the fading twilight.  "The night we \par
came back with the big haul, Jake and I agreed that one of the two of us would \par
always be awake.  Even then there was something peculiar in the Homer-Ellen-\par
Greta triangle.  At that time they were not yet all living together, but I still \par
didn't trust them.  While Jake was supposedly on watch, Greta balled his brains \par
out.  'To celebrate,' he said, when he apologized to me for falling asleep \par
afterwards.  When I woke up, more than half of the treasure was gone."\par
\tab Anger long buried was seething in Nick.  Carol watched him carefully, \par
noting the intensity of his passion.  "Jake didn't give a shit about the money.  \par
He even tried to talk Amanda and me out of going to court.  That's the kind of \par
guy he was.  I remember he told me, 'Hey, Nick, my friend, we made two hundred \par
thousand apiece out of this.  We cannot prove there was more.  Let's just be \par
thankful and get on with our lives.' Homer had cheated him and Greta had shit \par
all over him, but Jake still wasn't pissed.  Not much more than a year later, he \par
married a water ski queen from Winter Haven, bought a house in Orlando, and went \par
to work as an aerospace engineer."\par
\tab The light was vanishing outside.  Nick was deep in a memory, recalling the \par
full measure of his storm of righteous indignation from eight years before.  \par
"I've never understood them," Carol said quietly.  She switched off the \par
recorder.  Nick turned and looked at her, a quizzical frown on his face.  "You \par
know," she added, "the people like your friend Jake.  Infinite resiliency.  No \par
harbored grudges.  Whatever happens to them they just shake off, like water, and \par
go on living.  Cheerfully."  It was her turn to feel a little emotion.  \par
"Sometimes I wish I could be more like that.  Then I wouldn't be afraid."\par
\tab They stared at each other in the soft light.  Nick put his hand over hers.  \par
And there's that vulnerable little girl again.  He felt a deep emotional longing \par
stirring in his heart.  She's let me see it twice in a single day.  "Carol," he \par
said gently, "I want to thank you for this afternoon.  You know, for sharing \par
your feelings with me.  I feel like I saw an entirely different Carol Dawson."\par
\tab "You did," she said, smiling and making it clear that her protective \par
shield was going up again.  "And only time will tell if it was a huge mistake."  \par
She pulled her hand slowly away from his "For the moment, though, we have other \par
business.  Back to the menage a trois.  What kind of facility is it that they \par
manage and what do they do there?"\par
\tab "Excuse me?" replied Nick, obviously confused.\par
\tab "A friend of mine, Dr. Dale Michaels of the Miami Oceanographic Institute, \par
told me that Captain Homer and Ellen have some kind of high-tech operation here.  \par
I don't remember exactly how he described it \emdash  "\par
\tab "You must be mistaken," Nick interrupted.  "I have known them for almost \par
ten years and they are never anywhere except in that fancy house of his or \par
onboard the Ambrosia."\par
\tab Carol was puzzled.  "Dale's information is always correct.  He just told \par
me, yesterday in fact, that Homer Ashford had field tested the institute's most \par
advanced underwater sentries throughout the last five years and that his reports \par
\emdash  "\par
\tab "Hold it.  Hold it." Nick was leaning forward on the table.  "I'm not sure \par
I'm following you.  Back up.  This could be very very important."\par
\tab Carol started again.  "One of MOI's newest product areas is underwater \par
sentries, robots, essentially, that protect aquaculture farms from sophisticated \par
thieves as well as large fish or whales.  Dale said that Homer contributes money \par
for the research and then field tests the prototypes \emdash  "\par
\tab "Son of a bitch."  Nick was standing up.  He was bursting with excitement.  \par
"How could I have been so stupid?  Of course, of course."\par
\tab Now Carol was lost.  "Would you mind telling me what's going on?"\par
\tab "Certainly," Nick answered.  "But right now we're in a hurry.  We have to \par
go by my apartment to look at an old map and pick up another navigation system \par
for the boat.  I'll explain everything on the way."\par
\par
\tab Nick put his key card in the reader and the garage door opened.  He pulled \par
his Pontiac into his reserved spot and stopped the car.  "So you see," he was \par
saying to Carol, "he knew that we wouldn't find anything.  He let us search both \par
his house and the lot that he had bought for his new mansion, down at Pelican \par
Point.  We found nothing.  At that time it was still hidden somewhere out in the \par
ocean."\par
\tab "Did you look in the water around his new property at that time?"\par
\tab "Yes, we did.  Jake and I each dove there, on separate days.  We found a \par
very interesting subterranean cave, but no sign of any of the Santa Rosa \par
treasure.  But we must have given him the idea.  I bet he moved the stuff there \par
a year or two after Jake left.  He probably figured it was safe by then.  And he \par
had doubtless worried himself sick that someone would discover the treasure out \par
in the ocean.  You see, it all fits.  Including his involvement with underwater \par
sentries."\par
\tab Carol nodded and laughed a little.  "It certainly makes better sense than \par
your idea that Troy was working for the Russians."  They opened the doors and \par
climbed out of the car.  "So how much do you think they have left?"  Carol asked \par
as they headed for the elevator.\par
\tab "Who knows?"  Nick answered.  "Maybe they stole three million out of \par
five."  He thought for a minute.  "They must still have a bunch.  Otherwise \par
Greta would have split by now."\par
\tab The elevator doors opened and Nick pressed the button for the third floor.  \par
Carol heaved a big sigh.  "What's the matter?" he asked.\par
\tab "I'm exhausted," she said.  "I feel as if I'm on a carousel that's \par
spinning faster and faster.  So much has happened in the last three days.  I'm \par
not sure I could deal with much more.  What I need now is a second wind."\par
\tab "Magic days," Nick replied as they walked out of the elevator.  "These are \par
magic days."\par
\tab She looked at him with a curious expression.  He laughed.  "I'll explain \par
an old theory of mine later," he said.  He entered a sequence of numbers into \par
the small plate on his door and the lock disengaged.  Nick moved to the side \par
with feigned gallantry and let Carol enter first.  What she saw was chaos.\par
\tab The place was a total shambles.  In the living room, just beyond the \par
kitchen area, all of Nick's precious novels had been scattered randomly about on \par
the floor, the couch, and the chairs.  It looked as if someone had taken each \par
book out of the bookcase, held it up and shook it (trying to find loose papers \par
perhaps), and then either dropped it or thrown it across the room.  Nick pushed \par
by Carol and stared at the destruction.  "Shit," he said.\par
\tab The kitchen had been plundered as well.  All the drawers were open.  Pots, \par
pans, and tableware were strewn on the counters and on the floor.  To Nick's \par
right, the cardboard boxes containing his memorabilia had been pulled into the \par
middle of the second bedroom.  Their contents had been partially dumped onto the \par
floor around them.\par
\tab "What hurricane hit this place?"  Carol asked as she surveyed the mess.  \par
"I didn't expect you to be a good house-keeper, but this is ridiculous."\par
\tab Nick was unable to laugh at Carol's comment.  He checked the master \par
bedroom and found that it also had been ransacked.  He then returned to the \par
living room and started picking up his beloved novels and stacking them neatly \par
on the coffee table.  He winced when he found his worn copy of L'Etranger by \par
Albert Camus.  The spine of the book was destroyed.  "This is not the work of \par
vandals," he said as Carol knelt down to help.  "They were searching for \par
something specific."\par
\tab "Have you found anything missing yet?" she asked.\par
\tab "No," Nick replied, picking up another novel with a mutilated cover and \par
shaking his head.  "But the bastards have really screwed up my books."\par
\tab She stacked his Faulkner collection on the easy chair.  "I can see why \par
Troy was impressed," she said.  "Have you really read all these novels?"  Nick \par
nodded.  Carol picked one up that had fallen under the television stand.  \par
"What's this about?"  She held up the book.  "I've never even heard of it."\par
\tab Nick had just arranged another dozen books on the coffee table.  "Oh, \par
that's a fantastic novel," he said enthusiastically, forgetting for a moment \par
that his condominium had just been trashed.  "The whole story is told through \par
this exchange of letters among all the principal characters.  It's set in \par
eighteenth-century France, and the main couple, socially prominent and bored, \par
cement their weird relationship by sharing details of their affairs.  With other \par
lovers of course.  It caused quite a scandal in Europe."\par
\tab "That doesn't exactly sound like your typical Harlequin romance," Carol \par
remarked, trying to commit the title of the book to her memory.\par
\tab Nick stood up and walked into the smaller bedroom.  He began to sort \par
through the contents of the cardboard boxes.  "There are things missing in \par
here," he called out to Carol.  She stopped arranging books and joined him in \par
the bedroom.  "All my photographs of the Santa Rosa treasure and even the \par
newspaper clippings are gone.  That's odd," he said.\par
\tab Carol was beside him on the floor, in front of the boxes.  She frowned.  \par
"Is the trident still on the boat?"\par
\tab "Yes," he answered.  He stopped rifling through the papers.  "Down in the \par
bottom drawer of the electronics cabinet.  You think there's a connection?"\par
\tab She nodded.  "I think that was what they were after.  I don't know why.  \par
It just seems right."\par
\tab Nick picked up a large yellow folder that had been on the floor and \par
replaced it in one of the cardboard boxes.  A photograph and some sheets of \par
typing paper fell out.  Carol picked up the picture while Nick scrambled after \par
the papers.  She studied the photo and read the French inscription.  She was \par
surprised to feel a twinge of jealousy.  "Beautiful," she commented.  She \par
noticed the pearls.  "Also very rich and sophisticated.  She doesn't look like \par
your type."\par
\tab She handed Monique's photograph to Nick.  Despite his attempt to be \par
nonchalant, he was blushing.  "That was a long time ago," he mumbled as he \par
hastily stuffed the photo back into the folder.\par
\tab "Really?"  Carol said, eyeing him carefully.  "She looks as if she's about \par
our age.  It couldn't have been too long ago."\par
\tab Nick was flustered.  He packed some more loose material in the boxes and \par
glanced at his watch.  "We'd better leave soon if we're going to meet Troy at \par
your hotel."  He stood up.  Carol remained kneeling on the floor, looking up at \par
him with a steady gaze.  "It's a long story," he said.  "Someday I'll tell you \par
all about it."\par
\tab Carol's curiosity was piqued.  She followed Nick out of his condominium \par
and into the elevator.  He was still ill at ease.  Bullseye, she thought to \par
herself.  I think I have just discovered a major key to Mr. Williams.  A woman \par
named Monique.  She smiled as Nick motioned for her to precede him out of the \par
elevator.  And the man does love his books.\par
\par
\tab Carol's room at the Marriott had two entrances.  The normal approach to \par
the room was by way of the corridor that led to the lobby.  But there was \par
another door that opened on the garden and the pool.  When she exercised in the \par
morning, Carol always used the garden entrance.\par
\tab Nick and Carol were talking casually but quietly as they came toward her \par
room from the lobby.  She pulled out her electronic card key just before they \par
arrived.  As she started to insert the card into the lock, they heard an unusual \par
sound, like metal banging against metal, from the inside of her room.  Before \par
Carol could say anything, Nick shushed her by putting his finger to his mouth.  \par
"You heard it too?" she whispered softly.  He nodded his head.  Using gestures, \par
he asked her if there was another entrance to the room.  She pointed out the \par
door to the hotel grounds at the end of the corridor.\par
\tab Palm trees and tropical hedges covered most of the area to the east of the \par
Marriott swimming pool.  Nick and Carol left the walkway leading to the pool and \par
crept up to the windows of her room.  The venetian blinds were drawn but they \par
could still see into the room through a crack under the bottom of the blinds.  \par
At first the room was completely dark.  Then a solitary beam from a flashlight \par
reflected for an instant off one of the walls.  In that split second they saw a \par
silhouetted figure in the neighborhood of the television set, but they could not \par
identify him.  The flashlight came on again and it paused for a moment on the \par
door to the corridor.  The door was bolted.  In the brief flicker of the light \par
beam, Carol also saw that all her dresser drawers were open.\par
\tab Nick crawled over next to Carol in the flower bed just under the windows.  \par
"You stay here and watch," he whispered.  "I'll go get something from the car.  \par
Don't let them know you're here." He squeezed her shoulder and disappeared.  \par
Carol stayed glued to the window.  Once more the flashlight came on, \par
illuminating electronic parts spread out on the far bed.  Carol strained for a \par
look at who was holding the flashlight.  She couldn't see him.\par
\tab She became acutely aware of the passage of time.  Her intuition told her \par
that the intruder was getting ready to leave.  She suddenly realized she was \par
completely exposed sitting out there underneath the window.  Come on, Nick, she \par
said to herself.  Hurry it up.  Or I may be chopped liver.  The figure in the \par
room moved toward the garden door and then stopped Carol felt her pulse rate \par
increase.  At just that moment Nick returned, out of breath.  He had brought \par
back a long crowbar from the trunk of his car.  Carol motioned to him to stand \par
by the door, that the intruder was about to come out.\par
\tab She saw the figure put his hand on the doorknob and she flattened herself \par
against the dirt.  Nick was behind the door, poised to deliver a powerful blow \par
to whoever exited from the room.  The door opened, Nick started to strike.  \par
"Troy," screamed Carol from the flower bed.  He jumped back just in time, barely \par
missing the downward swoop of Nick's crowbar.  Carol was on her feet in an \par
instant.  She ran up to a shaken Troy.  "Are you all right?" she said.\par
\tab His eyes were wide from fright.  "Jesus, Professor," he said, glancing at \par
the crowbar that Nick was wielding, "you might have killed me."\par
\tab "Shit, Jefferson," Nick replied, the adrenaline still coursing through his \par
system, "why didn't you tell us it was you?  And what were you doing in Carol's \par
room?"  He looked at Troy accusingly.\par
\tab Troy backed into the room and turned on the lights.  The room was a \par
disaster.  It looked like Nick's condominium when Carol had first walked through \par
the front door.\par
\tab Carol turned to Troy.  "Why on earth .  .  ."\par
\tab "I didn't do it, angel," he replied.  "Honest Injun."  Troy looked at his \par
two friends.  "Sit down," he said.  "This will only take a second."\par
\tab Meanwhile Carol's eyes were scanning the room.  "Crap," she said angrily, \par
"all my cameras and film are gone.  And virtually the entire telescope system, \par
including the post-processor unit.  Dale will shoot me."  She looked in one of \par
the open drawers.  "The assholes took my photographs from the first dive as \par
well.  They were in a large envelope on the right side of this top drawer."\par
\tab Carol sat down on the bed looking a little dazed.  "All the film from the \par
photographs that I took inside that place has been stolen.  So much for my \par
sensational story," she said.\par
\tab Nick tried to comfort her.  "Who knows.  Maybe they'll turn up.  And \par
besides, yal still have all the negatives from the first dive."\par
\tab Carol shook her head.  "It's not the same thing."  She thought for a \par
minute.  "Damnit," she said, "I should have kept the exposed film with me when \par
we left the hotel to go to Troy's apartment." She looked at the two men and then \par
brightened a bit.  "Oh well," she said.  "There's always tomorrow."\par
\tab Troy was still waiting patiently to give his explanation.  He indicated \par
for Nick to sit down on the bed next to Carol.  "I'll make this short and \par
sweet," he said.  "Just the facts.  I arrived here about seven o'clock.  I came \par
early because I wanted to make some modifications to your television set.  I'll \par
explain why in a minute.\par
\tab "The people in the hotel wouldn't give me a key to your room so I came \par
down here and fooled the card reader."  He smiled.  "It's no problem for someone \par
who knows how these things work.  Anyway, as soon as the green light came on and \par
the guard bolt released, I heard the garden door slam.  Someone had been in the \par
room while I was opening the door.  I caught a fleeting glimpse of him as he \par
hightailed it around the corner of the building.  He was a big man, not someone \par
I recognized immediately.  He was moving with difficulty, as if he were carrying \par
something heavy."\par
\tab "Part of the ocean telescope," Carol said.\par
\tab "Go on," added Nick.  "What happened next?  I want to hear why you were in \par
Carol's room working in the dark.  I bet you'll come up with a good story for \par
that too."\par
\tab "That's easy," Troy said to Nick.  "I was afraid the thief or thieves \par
might come back.  I didn't want them to see me."\par
\tab "You're amazing, Jefferson," Nick responded.  "You're the kind of person \par
who would tell a cop that you were exceeding the speed limit because you wanted \par
to get to a filling station before you ran out of gas."\par
\tab "And the cop would believe him," Carol remarked.  They all laughed.  The \par
tension in the room was diffusing.\par
\tab "All right," said Nick.  "Now tell us what you've done to the television.  \par
Incidentally, how did you get inside it?  I thought these hotel sets were all \par
alarmed."\par
\tab "They are," Troy replied, "but it's very simple to disable the alarm \par
system.  It always cracks me up.  Somebody sells the hotel the idea that they \par
can protect their property with these alarms.  But the burglars can easily find \par
out what system has been installed, buy the circuit data sheets, and completely \par
disable the protection."\par
\tab Troy glanced around the room.  He then checked his watch carefully.  \par
"Let's see," he said.  "Why don't you two move over here in these chairs.  I \par
think you'll be able to see better."  Nick and Carol exchanged puzzled looks and \par
arranged themselves as Troy had requested.  "Now," he continued in a \par
surprisingly serious tone, "you will see what I believe is incontrovertible \par
proof that my story about the aliens is true.  They have told me, through this \par
bracelet, that they are going to televise a short program from inside the \par
vehicle at exactly seven-thirty.  If I have translated their directions properly \par
and made the correct modifications, this television should now be able to \par
receive their transmission."\par
\tab He turned on the set and put it on channel 44.  There was nothing but snow \par
and static.  "This is great, Troy," Nick commented.  "It will probably steal \par
rating points from soap operas and music videos.  Watching this requires even \par
less intelligence \emdash  "\par
\tab A picture suddenly appeared on the screen.  The lighting was poor, but \par
Carol immediately recognized herself in the scene.  She was standing with her \par
back to the cameras, her fingers moving around on top of what appeared to be a \par
table.\par
\tab An orchestral version of "Silent Night," featuring an instrument not \par
unlike an organ, accompanied the picture.\par
\tab "That's the music room I told you about," Carol said to Nick.  "I guess \par
that warden thing had a video camera in all his paraphernalia."\par
\tab The television scene switched immediately to a close-up of Carol's eyes.  \par
For five seconds her marvelous, frightened eyes filled almost the entire screen.  \par
She blinked twice before the camera pulled back and revealed her in front view.  \par
terrified, standing and shaking in her bathing suit.  Carol shuddered as she \par
recalled the horror of those seconds when the warden's appendages intruded upon \par
her person.  It was all shown in the video, some parts even in slow motion.  One \par
of the featured scenes was the deliberate movement of the bristles across her \par
chest, including both her erect nipples.  Oh my God, she thought.  I hadn't \par
realized they were erect.  Maybe fear does that.  Carol squirmed.  She felt \par
surprisingly embarrassed in front of Nick.\par
\tab There was a jump discontinuity in the program.  In the next scene the \par
three of them were looking at Troy, lying on his back on the floor somewhere, \par
with enough wires and cords attached to him that he could have been Gulliver \par
bound by the Lilliputians.  The camera panned around the room.  Two wardens were \par
in one of the corners.  Their upper body attachments were not even similar, but \par
they both had the same central body, amoebalike, that had confronted Troy and \par
Carol.  On the other side of the room a pair of carpets were standing together.  \par
From their motions it looked as if they were engaged in a conversation.  Nick \par
and Carol and Troy watched while the camera stayed fixed for about ten seconds.  \par
The carpets apparently finished conferring and then flipped off in separate \par
directions.\par
\tab The final frames of the transmission were a close-up of Troy's head \par
showing more than a hundred probes and inserts connected to his brain.  Then the \par
screen went back to snow and static.  "Wowee," said Nick after a moment.  "Can I \par
have an instant replay?"  He stood up from the bed.  "You were terrific," he \par
remarked to Carol, "but I think your scenes will have to be edited if we want a \par
PG rating."\par
\tab Carol looked up at him and blushed slightly.  "Sorry, Nick, but I don't \par
think you make a good comedian.  We have one already," she nodded at Troy, "and \par
I think that's enough."  She glanced at the clock beside her bed.  "Now I figure \par
we have fifteen minutes or so to make plans.  No more.  And I have to dress as \par
well.  Why don't you tell Troy about your decision and what you have concluded \par
about the Santa Rosa loot while I change my clothes."  She grabbed a blouse and \par
a pair of pants and headed for the bathroom.\par
\tab "Hey, wait a minute," Nick protested.  "Aren't we going to discuss who it \par
was that broke into my condominium and your hotel room?"\par
\tab Carol stopped outside the bathroom door.  "There are only two \par
possibilities that make any sense," she said.  "It's either the Navy or our \par
sicko friends from the Ambrosia.  Either way we'll find out soon enough."  She \par
stopped a moment and an elfin smile played across her lips.  "I want you two to \par
see if you can figure out a way to steal Homer's gold.  Tonight.  Before we go \par
back to meet with our extraterrestrials tomorrow morning."\par
\par

\par
CAROL and Troy went over the details one last time and she checked her watch.  \par
"It's eight-thirty already," she said.  "If I'm much later I know they'll be \par
suspicious." She was standing outside Nick's Pontiac in the parking lot of the \par
Pelican Resort, a restaurant about three-quarters of a mile from the Ashford \par
mansion at Pelican Point.  "Where is he?" she fretted.  "We should have finished \par
with this fifteen minutes ago."\par
\tab "Just calm down, angel," Troy replied.  "We have to test this new unit \par
first.  It could be very important in an emergency and I've never actually used \par
it." He gave her a reassuring hug.  "Your friends at MOI originally developed \par
it."\par
\tab "Why did I have to suggest such a wild-ass idea?"  Carol said out loud to \par
herself.  "Where's your brain, Dawson?  Did you leave it in the .  .  ."\par
\tab "Can you hear me?" Nick's garbled voice interrupted her.  It sounded as if \par
it were coming from the bottom of a well.\par
\tab "Yes," Troy answered into a tiny walkie-talkie shaped like a thimble.  \par
"But not too clearly.  How deep are you?"\par
\tab "Say again," said Nick.  "I did not copy completely."\par
\tab "Yes, we can hear you," Troy shouted.  He carefully enunciated each word.  \par
"But not very clearly.  You must speak slowly and distinctly.  How deep are \par
you?"\par
\tab "About eight feet," was the response.\par
\tab "Go down to sixteen and try it again," said Troy.  "Let's see if it will \par
work from the deepest part of the cave."\par
\tab "How's he doing that?"  Carol asked, while they waited for Nick to \par
descend.\par
\tab "It's a brand-new system, built into the regulator," Troy answered.  "You \par
have to speak while you're exhaling for it to work.  There's a small \par
transmitter/receiver inside the mouthpiece and an earphone attachment.  \par
Unfortunately, it doesn't work much below ten feet."\par
\tab Almost a minute later Carol and Troy heard something, very faint, not even \par
recognizable as Nick's voice.  Troy listened for a moment.  "We cannot read you, \par
Nick.  There is too much attenuation.  Come on back now.  I'm going to send \par
Carol on her way."  Troy pressed a button on the walkie-talkie that would \par
repeatedly transmit this last message.\par
\tab He handed the communications unit to Carol.  "Okay, angel," he said, \par
"you're ready.  We should be in the water around nine o'clock and out, if all \par
goes well, by half an hour later.  Keep them occupied with your questions.  You \par
should leave by ten-thirty at the latest and drive directly to Nick's apartment.  \par
We will meet you there with your wagon." He raised his eyebrows.  "And the gold, \par
I hope."\par
\tab Carol took a deep breath.  She smiled at Troy.  "I'm scared," she said.  \par
"I would rather face a carpet or even one of those warden things than this \par
trio."  She opened the car door.  "Do you really think I should go in Nick's \par
car?  Isn't that certain to make them suspect something?"\par
\tab "We've been through all this twice before, angel," Troy laughingly \par
replied.  He gently nudged her into the car.  "They already know we're friends.  \par
Besides, we need your wagon for the diving gear, the backpacks, and the lead and \par
gold."  He closed the door and planted a light kiss on her cheek through the \par
open window.  "Be safe, angel," he said.  "And don't take any unnecessary \par
chances."\par
\tab Carol started the car and backed into the middle of the parking lot.  She \par
waved at Troy and pulled into the dark lane that led through the marsh to the \par
end of the island.  The only light was from the nearly full gibbous moon that \par
was already above the trees.  All right, Dawson, she thought to herself.  Now \par
you're in the middle of it.  Just stay calm and alert.\par
\tab She drove very slowly.  She reviewed the plans for the evening several \par
times in her mind.  Then she started thinking about Nick.  He holds on to \par
things.  Like I do.  He still hates Homer and Greta for cheating him.  He \par
couldn't wait to dive for the gold.  She smiled as she turned into the circular \par
drive in front of Homer Ashford's house.  I just hope there is some left over \par
for him.\par
\tab A split second after Carol rang the doorbell, Homer opened the door and \par
greeted her.  "You're late," he said in a pleasant monotone.  "We thought maybe \par
you were not coming.  Greta is already in the pool.  Do you want to change and \par
join her?"\par
\tab "Thanks, Captain Homer, but I decided not to swim tonight," Carol answered \par
politely.  "I appreciate the offer, but I'm mostly here on business.  I would \par
prefer to start the interview as soon as possible.  Even before dinner, if that \par
would be all right with everyone else."\par
\tab Homer led Carol into a gigantic family room and stopped by a large wet \par
bar.  A magnificent hand-carved wooden statue of a swimming Neptune, about four \par
feet long altogether, was on the wall above the bar.  Carol asked for some white \par
wine.  Homer tried without success to talk her into something stronger.\par
\tab The family room had a billiards table at one end.  On the other side, a \par
sliding glass door opened onto a covered patio that narrowed into a cement \par
walkway.  Carol followed Homer in silence, sipping from her white wine every \par
twenty steps or so.  The walkway wound past big trees and a lighted gazebo off \par
to the left before it spread out around the huge swimming pool.\par
\tab Actually there were two pools.  In front of Carol was a classic, \par
rectangular, Olympic-sized pool under strong lights.  At one end was a slide and \par
waterfall that ran down an artificial mountain into the swimming area.  At the \par
other end, in the direction of the second pool and the ocean, there was a sunken \par
Jacuzzi constructed out of the same decorated blue tiles that rimmed the top of \par
the main pool.  The entire complex was cleverly designed to create the \par
impression of moving water.  There seemed to be a steady flow from the \par
waterfall, to the large pool.  down into the Jacuzzi, and then into a stream \par
that meandered off in the direction of the house.\par
\tab The second pool was circular and dark.  It was off to Carol's left at the \par
edge of the property, near what looked like a small cottage for changing \par
clothes.  Greta was in the rectangular pool in front of Carol.  She was swimming \par
laps, her powerful body moving rhythmically through the water.  Carol, who was \par
an excellent swimmer herself, watched Greta for a few seconds.\par
\tab "Isn't she something?"  Homer walked over next to Carol.  His admiration \par
was obvious.  "She won't let herself eat a big meal unless she works out \par
beforehand.  She can't stand fat."\par
\tab Homer was wearing a light brown Hawaiian shirt with a pair of tan slacks.  \par
Brown loafers were on his feet, and a big drink, crammed with ice cubes, was in \par
his hand.  He seemed relaxed, even affable.  Carol thought he could have passed \par
for a retired banker or corporate executive.\par
\tab Greta continued to swim relentlessly through the water.  Homer was \par
hovering over Carol and she was beginning to feel uncomfortable, as if her space \par
were being invaded.\par
\tab "Where's Ellen?" she asked, turning to the large man and moving just \par
slightly farther away from him.\par
\tab "She's in the kitchen," Homer replied.  "She loves to cook, especially \par
when we have guests.  And tonight she's making one of her favorite dishes."  \par
There was almost a twinkle in his eye.  He leaned down to Carol.  "She made me \par
promise not to tell you what we're having," he whispered confidentially, "but I \par
will tell you that it's a powerful aphrodisiac."\par
\tab Ugh, said Carol to herself as she caught a whiff of Homer's breath and \par
listened to his leering chuckle.  How could I have forgotten how repulsive this \par
man is? Does he really think that  .  .  .  Carol stopped her thought.  She \par
reminded herself that people with excessive money very often lose touch with \par
reality.  Probably some of the women respond.  For what he can give them.  She \par
almost gagged.  The thought of having any kind of sexual liaison with Homer was \par
totally repugnant.\par
\tab Greta had finished swimming laps.  She climbed out of the pool and dried \par
herself off.  Her all-white racing uniform was like a transparent body stocking.  \par
Even from a distance, Carol could not avoid seeing the full detail of her \par
nipples and breasts as well as her clump of pubic hair through the thin suit.  \par
She might as well have been naked.  Homer stood beside Carol, unabashedly \par
staring as Greta strode across the cement.\par
\tab "No suit?"  Greta said just before she reached them.  Her eyes were trying \par
to bore holes in Carol's.  Carol shook her head.  "I'm sorry," said Greta.  \par
"Homer had hoped that we might have a race." She looked at the captain with an \par
odd expression that Carol did not understand.  "He loves to see women in \par
competition."\par
\tab "It would have been no contest," Carol answered.  She thought she saw \par
Greta tense.  "You would have won easily," she added.  "You swim beautifully."\par
\tab Greta smiled, accepting the compliment.  Her eyes roamed over Carol's \par
body.  She made no effort to hide the fact that she was doing an appraisal.  \par
"You have a good body too for swimming," Greta said.  "Maybe a little too fat on \par
the ass and upper legs.  I could suggest workout \emdash  "\par
\tab "Why don't we show Miss Dawson the other pool?"  Homer interrupted.  \par
"Before you go inside and change clothes."  He started walking toward the little \par
cottage near the ocean.  Without saying another word, Greta turned and followed \par
him.  Carol took a sip from her wine.  Who knows what goes on here, she thought \par
.  Those three have not had to work for eight years.  They take people out \par
fishing and diving for amusement.  A strange mixture of disgust and depression \par
started to spread in her.  So they manufacture entertainment to keep from being \par
bored.\par
\tab Moments after Homer entered the cottage, a bank of flood-lights down \par
underneath the second pool was illuminated.  Homer gestured for her to hurry and \par
Carol skipped into the cottage.  They led her down a flight of steps.  Under the \par
ground was a walkway that completely encircled the large glass aquarium that had \par
looked, in the darkness, like a second swimming pool.  "We have six sharks now," \par
Homer said proudly, "as well as three red occi, a pair of cuttlefish, and of \par
course hundreds of more standard species of fish and plants."\par
\tab "Occi?" inquired Carol.\par
\tab "That's the slang plural of octopus," Homer responded with a smug, self-\par
satisfied smile.  "Actually, the correct plural is octopodes, even though \par
everyone now accepts octopi because it has been used so much."\par
\tab Greta was standing with her face pressed against the glass.  A couple of \par
bat rays swam past.  She was waiting for something.  After twenty seconds or so \par
a grayish shark appeared.  The shark seemed to notice Greta and stopped, \par
watching her, its face about five feet away from the glass.  Carol could see the \par
long sharp teeth and identified it as a mako, a fierce smaller cousin of the \par
man-eating great white shark.\par
\tab "That's Greta's pet," said Homer.  "His name is Timmy.  Somehow she has \par
trained him to recognize her face against the glass.  " Homer watched a few more \par
seconds.  "From time to time she goes in there to swim with him.  When the \par
sharks have finished eating, of course."\par
\tab The shark remained in place, staring blankly in Greta's direction.  She \par
began to drum her fingers against the glass in regular cadence.  "Now this is \par
exciting," Homer said, walking over next to Greta and the aquarium.  "What you \par
are going to see is what biologists call a typical Pavlovian response.  I've \par
never seen it quite this way before in a shark."\par
\tab The mako began to be agitated.  Greta started increasing the tempo, the \par
shark responding by whipping the water back and forth with its tail.  Suddenly \par
Greta disappeared up the stairs.  Carol thought she noticed a faraway look in \par
her eyes when Greta zoomed by her.  Carol looked at Homer for an explanation.  \par
"Come down here closer," he gestured to Carol.  "You don't want to miss this.  \par
Greta cares for the rabbits herself.  And Timmy always puts on a grand show."\par
\tab Carol wasn't exactly sure what Homer was talking about.  But she was \par
enjoying the lovely aquarium.  It contained crystal-clear sea water, obviously \par
filtered and recycled regularly.  Carol noticed several species of sponges and \par
coral, as well as urchin and anemone.  Someone had gone to great trouble and \par
expense to re-create the conditions in the reefs just off-shore Key West.\par
\tab Suddenly a beheaded white rabbit impaled on a long vertical staff, the \par
blood still spurting from its arteries, appeared in the aquarium just opposite \par
where Carol and Homer were standing.  It was over in an instant.  Driven to \par
immediate frenzy by the blood in the water, the mako attacked, its teeth ripping \par
half the hapless rabbit off the stave with the first bite.  The second swoop \par
captured the rest of the rabbit and snapped the rod as well.  Carol barely had \par
time to recoil and turn her head.  When she jumped back, she spilled wine all \par
over her blouse.\par
\tab Trying to appear calm, she reached in her purse for a tissue to wipe her \par
blouse.  She said nothing.  She had had a perfect view of the shark's attack and \par
could still feel the adrenaline imbalance that the fright had produced.  Great \par
way to start a dinner party, she thought.  Why haven't I ever thought of it?  \par
Dawson, these people are weird.\par
\tab Homer was still excited.  "Wasn't that spectacular?  Such raw, savage \par
power in those jaws.  Driven by pure instinct.  I never get tired of it."\par
\tab Carol followed him up the stairs.  "Good show, Greta," she heard Homer say \par
when they walked out of the cottage.  "It was right in front of us.  Two bites.  \par
Wham, wham, and the rabbit was gone."\par
\tab "I know," said Greta.  She was holding a diving mask.  What was left of \par
the staff was on the ground beside her.  "I could see from up here."  Greta was \par
staring at Carol, obviously trying to discover her reaction.  Carol averted her \par
eyes.  She was not going to give Greta the satisfaction of knowing she had found \par
it repulsive.\par
\tab "Greta has the whole thing down to split-second timing," Homer continued \par
as they walked back through the gardens to the house.  "She prepares the live \par
rabbit on the chopping block an hour early.  Then, when Timmy is ready, she .  .  \par
.  ."\par
\tab Carol tuned his gruesome story out of her mind.  I don't want to hear \par
this, she thought.  She glanced at her watch. Ten minutes after nine.  Come on \par
guys.  Be swift.  I'm not certain I can stand these people for another hour.\par
\par
\tab Nick and Troy swam silently along the shoreline in the moonlight.  They \par
had carefully rehearsed the plan.  No additional light until they were in the \par
cove beside Homer's property and at least ten feet under water.  Troy would \par
lead, searching for alarm systems he could disable with the tools stuffed in the \par
pockets of his wet suit.  He would also keep a lookout for the infamous robot \par
sentries.  Nick would follow with the buoyancy bags they would use to carry the \par
gold.\par
\tab They had walked along the beach from the Pelican Resort parking lot, \par
wearing their heavy diving suits as well as the backpacks, until they were only \par
about a hundred yards from the thick fence that marked Homer's property.  Then \par
they had set down the packs containing their clothes and eased into the water.  \par
During the walk Troy had had several problems with his tools, and a decision to \par
reduce his arsenal of gadgets had delayed their arrival at the embarkation point \par
by five minutes.  Just before they went into the water, Nick had given an \par
uncharacteristic squeal of excitement and grabbed Troy by the shoulders.  "I \par
hope that fucking gold is there," he had said.  "I cannot wait to see their \par
faces after we steal it."\par
\tab It was time to submerge.  Holding hands in the darkness, Nick and Troy \par
dropped about five feet under the water.  They stopped, equalized the pressure \par
in their heads, and repeated the procedure.  When they were down about ten feet, \par
Troy turned on the searchlight.  They quickly worked out their directions and \par
headed around the corner, deeper into the cove adjoining Homer's estate.\par
\tab Troy was in the lead.  He had no trouble finding the entrance to the \par
natural tunnel that led to the subterranean cave.  As they had planned, Nick \par
waited outside the tunnel while Troy went inside to look for alarms.  The rock \par
cliffs closed over his head.  The watery entryway was about five feet across and \par
four feet high.  Troy immediately found a metal box affixed to the left wall, \par
where it was partially hidden from view.  When he examined the box, he \par
discovered that it was emitting two laser beams separated by about three feet.\par
\tab On the other side of the natural tunnel were the receiving plates for the \par
beams as well as the alarm electronics.  Troy swam over carefully, pulled out \par
his screwdriver, and dismantled the housing.  The system was very simple.  \par
Failure of either plate to receive a beam would trigger the opening of a relay.  \par
When both relays were open, current could flow to the alarm.  Thus an object had \par
to be large enough to break both beams simultaneously to set off an alarm.  Troy \par
smiled to himself as he validated the operating principle by passing his hand in \par
front of one of the beams.  Then he jerryrigged one of the relays permanently \par
closed.  Satisfied with his work, he swam back and forth in the tunnel, breaking \par
both beams at the same time, assuring himself that he had rendered the alarm \par
system ineffective.\par
\tab He swam back out to meet Nick and gave him the thumbs-up sign.  The two \par
men passed through the fifty yards of natural tunnel into the subterranean cave.  \par
Where the narrow passageway widened, Troy again gestured to Nick to remain \par
behind while he, Troy, went into the cave to check for booby-traps.  Nick let \par
his feet fall to the bottom of the tunnel and switched on his own small \par
flashlight.  He was in a perfect place for an ambush.  The tunnel was so small \par
here that there was virtually no maneuvering room He wondered what an underwater \par
sentry would look like.  What a place to die, he thought suddenly.  Fear swept \par
over him as he turned off his flashlight and looked down at his illuminated \par
diver's watch.  He watched the glowing second hand sweeping around the face.  He \par
tried to calm himself.  It had been three minutes since Troy had left.  Why is \par
he taking so long? he asked himself.  He must have found something.  Another \par
minute passed.  Then another.  Nick was having a hard time quelling the onset of \par
panic.  What do I do if he doesn't return?\par
\tab Just as Nick was about to swim into the cave on his own, he caught sight \par
of Troy's searchlight coming toward him Troy waved and Nick followed.  Within \par
thirty seconds they were in the shallow part of the cave, where the water was \par
only about four feet deep.  The two men stood up with their flippers lodged \par
against the rocks to protect themselves from falling in the intermittent tidal \par
surges.\par
\tab Nick pulled his regulator out of his mouth and flipped his mask back on \par
his head.  Before he could speak, Troy put a finger against Nick's lips.  "Speak \par
very softly," Troy's whisper was barely audible.  "The place could be alarmed \par
for sound as well."\par
\tab There was no light in the cave except Troy's searchlight.  However, over \par
their heads, in the highest corners of the rock ceiling, Troy pointed out two \par
separate banks of fluorescent lighting.  The cave itself was an irregular oval, \par
about thirty yards in its longest dimension and maybe fifteen yards across at \par
its widest point.  The ceiling was only about three feet above the water near \par
the entrance to the tunnel out to the ocean, but it was twenty feet high in the \par
corner where they were standing in the shallow water.\par
\tab "Well, Professor," Troy continued whispering, "I have good news and bad \par
news.  The bad news is that there is no treasure here in this cave.  The good \par
news is that there are two other tunnels, both manmade, that lead away from this \par
place and go under Captain Homer's property."  He paused for a moment and \par
watched his partner.  "Shall we go for it?"\par
\tab Nick looked at his watch.  It was nine-twenty already.  He nodded.  "The \par
bastard spent a lot of money down here.  They must have stolen more than I \par
figured." Nick adjusted his diving equipment.\par
\tab "We'll start with the tunnel on the left.  As before, I'll lead to look \par
for trouble."  Troy cast his searchlight around on the ceiling.  "This is a \par
strange place.  But beautiful.  It looks like another planet, doesn't it?"\par
\tab Nick pulled his mask back over his face and slipped the regulator in his \par
mouth.  He flopped backward into the sea water.  Troy followed and, once under \par
the surface, showed Nick the way to the first manmade tunnel.  This tunnel was \par
on the other side of the cave, about twelve feet below the water at its lowest \par
point.  It was made of normal circular sewer pipe.  The diameter of the pipe was \par
about five feet, making the tunnel approximately the same size as the natural \par
passageway between the ocean and the cave.  Troy entered the tunnel gingerly.  \par
He swam back and forth from side to side, examining one wall for a few yards and \par
then going across to the other.  He almost missed the long, slender alarm box.  \par
It was embedded in the ceiling at a junction between two sections of sewer pipe \par
and Troy just happened to look up before he triggered the alarm.\par
\tab This system worked on a different principle.  A camera or other optical \par
device in the box on the ceiling took repeated images of a square foot of the \par
tunnel bottom that was backlit by an illuminated square cleverly concealed below \par
the normal concrete floor.  Apparently some kind of data comparison algorithm in \par
the alarm processor contained logic by which the consecutive pictures could be \par
assessed, in terms of threat, and an alarm triggered if necessary.  It was the \par
most complicated device of its kind that Troy had ever seen and he quickly \par
recognized the similarities between this system and the ocean telescope that had \par
been onboard the Florida Queen.  That means MOI designed and developed it, he \par
thought to himself.  So I'd best be careful.  I bet the algorithm is set so that \par
disturbances to the camera trigger the alarm as well.\par
\tab Nick had swum over to the side of the tunnel, out of the way, and was \par
watching Troy try to open up the alarm box without jiggling the optical \par
instrument.  To accommodate the almost two-inch width of the box, there was a \par
gap of that size everywhere around the circle connecting the two sequential \par
sections of pipe.  Throughout the rest of the tunnel, all adjoining sections \par
were cemented together.  Here the passageway was discontinuous.\par
\tab Curious, thought Nick.  He idly shone his small flashlight into the \par
blackness in the gap beside him, expecting to see nothing but a wall of rock.  \par
What in the world is that? he wondered, as his light fell upon some metal object \par
that looked like a large grating.  The grating was resting upon an old piece of \par
railroad track.  Nick looked more carefully.  He could make out a gear box and \par
some pulleys, but he had no idea how all these mechanical devices fit together.\par
\tab Meanwhile Troy had managed to remove the housing from the alarm box \par
without disturbing the camera and was busy trying to understand the inner \par
workings of the system.  Whew, he thought.  This is much too complicated to \par
figure out in five minutes.  If I can just isolate the alarm, that should be \par
enough.  It was tough work under the water.  But Troy was clever and the \par
electronics were packaged in a logical fashion.  He was able to find the alarm \par
and disable it.  Afterward Troy lingered for several seconds trying to determine \par
the purpose of the other circuits connected to the alarm subassembly.\par
\tab Nick had intended to show Troy what he had found in the gap; however, as \par
he watched his friend struggling with the complex circuitry of the alarm box, he \par
became again worried about the passage of time.  It was now almost a quarter to \par
ten.  He caught Troy's eye and pointed at his watch.  Troy reluctantly abandoned \par
his investigation of the alarm and proceeded down the tunnel.\par
\tab Thirty yards farther the tunnel passed what looked like a door to a \par
submarine on their left.  Both Troy and Nick tried pulling on the handle of the \par
large and very heavy round door but nothing happened.  With gestures Troy told \par
Nick to continue trying to open the door while he swam on down the tunnel.\par
\tab The gold bars and other objects that remained from the Santa Rosa treasure \par
were sitting in the tunnel another thirty yards beyond the round door.  The \par
passageway itself came to an abrupt halt against a rock wall.  In front of the \par
wall was an array of gold and silver objects, stacked to an average depth of a \par
foot or so across the width of the tunnel.  The treasure was not hidden in any \par
way, it was simply scattered in random piles on the concrete floor at the end of \par
the tunnel.  Troy was ecstatic.  There's plenty here, he thought.  Enough for \par
the aliens.  Enough for Nick.  Maybe even some left over for Carol and me.\par
\tab He swam back to find Nick.  Nick was absolutely exultant when he saw the \par
unmistakable smile on Troy's face.  He raced around his friend to the end of the \par
tunnel When Nick first reached the treasure, he spent a minute or two swimming \par
around, picking up each object that was different and dropping it back into the \par
piles on the floor.\par
\tab Holy shit, Nick said gleefully to himself as he and Troy started putting \par
gold bars into the buoyancy bags.  I was right for once.  There must be over a \par
hundred pounds in bars alone.  They had agreed before the dive just to bring out \par
the bars, provided there were enough.  The bars were the only objects they could \par
be certain were pure gold.  Even if we take fifty-eight to Troy's friends, that \par
might leave fifty or so for us.  He did a quick mental calculation.  That could \par
be over three hundred thousand dollars apiece.  Whoopee.\par
\tab Joy and excitement surged through Nick.  He was having difficulty \par
containing himself.  He wanted to sing, to dance, to jump with joy.  He had been \par
right after all.  The bastards had stolen most of the treasure and now he was \par
stealing it back.  There's no happiness quite like the redressing of an old and \par
painful grievance.  And to do it with panache .  .  .  Nick was already \par
celebrating in his heart.  This was his day.\par
\tab Filling the bags took no time at all.  Nick and Troy both felt as if they \par
had infinite energy.  When they had finished picking up the gold bars, Troy \par
gestured down the tunnel.  Nick looked down at the other treasure objects \par
remaining on the floor.  We should take it all, he thought.  We should leave \par
Homer and Greta nothing.  Nothing at all.  But he had to be practical.  Each of \par
their bags was virtually full and they would be heavy enough as they were.\par
\tab Nick swam off in the direction of the ocean, his buoyancy bag full of gold \par
trailing behind him.  Troy followed.  As they passed the bulky door on the \par
right, Troy found himself thinking again about the circuitry leading to the \par
alarm in the box just ahead, between the two sections of pipe.  What could those \par
other connections be for?  Suddenly he remembered seeing a diagram in an \par
electronics magazine about advanced timers that could reinitialize systems and \par
swap out failed parts.  By now the component that Troy had disabled might have \par
been declared a failure by the smart processor in the alarm box, in which case \par
it would have either been replaced by a redundant part or the system would be \par
ignoring its output.  In either situation, Troy thought, that means the system \par
could be active again.\par
\tab It was too late.  Nick swam into the field of view of the optical device \par
and lights came on throughout the tunnel.  A metal gate started closing behind \par
Nick and his bag of gold.  It was only with a burst of speed that Troy propelled \par
himself through before the gate shut completely.  But his buoyancy bag full of \par
gold bars was left behind, on the other side of the gate.\par
\tab Nick stared at Troy's lost bag as it floated to the floor.  He reached \par
through the bars, grabbed the bag, and tried to pull it through.  It was \par
useless.  He shook the gate.  The metal was extremely sturdy.  Angry and \par
frustrated, he punched the gate with his fists.  As Nick caught his breath in \par
between punches, he became aware of a strange droning sound, like a motor, \par
somewhere in the distance behind him.  He turned around to find Troy.  He could \par
not see him anywhere.\par
\tab Troy had been exhausted by his swimming sprint through the closing gate.  \par
His energy spent, he had let himself fall to the floor of the pool in the \par
deepest part of the cave, halfway between the two manmade tunnels.  He took \par
several deep breaths through his mouthpiece and checked his air supply.  He had \par
about ten minutes remaining.  He watched for a moment as Nick, almost out of \par
sight to his right, tried fruitlessly to pull Troy's bag through the gate.  \par
Shit, Troy thought, disappointed that he had lost the gold, if only I had been \par
thinking.  I should have known .  .  .  He heard an unusual sound off to his \par
left.  Curious, Troy swam over to the entrance of the other tunnel and right \par
into the path of the robot sentry.\par
\tab Even though the original distance between them was over fifty feet, the \par
guidance mechanism of the sentry fixed on Troy as soon as he appeared.  Startled \par
and fascinated, at first Troy did not try to avoid the onrush of the bullet-\par
shaped submarine.  The sentry was three feet long and a foot wide in its \par
midsection.  When it was about eight feet away, the sentry slowly loaded and \par
fired a small but powerful spear, the size of a table knife, that Troy just \par
managed to avoid as it hurtled past.  The spear crashed into the wall beside \par
him.\par
\tab Adrenaline surged into Troy's system and he swam out into the middle of \par
the pool.  The sentry did not follow him immediately.  Instead it moved over in \par
front of the natural passageway to the ocean, thereby cutting off the escape \par
route, and then turned around to make a systematic search of the pool .  Damnit, \par
Troy was thinking, why didn't I leave while I had the chance?  He wondered if \par
Nick was still over by the gate.\par
\tab The sentry had now found Nick in its field of vision.  He was swimming \par
slowly toward the exit with his buoyancy bag.  He was unaware that he and Troy \par
were not alone in the pool.  By the time Nick saw the sentry, he was fifteen \par
feet away and within easy range of its underwater gun.  Troy watched the sentry \par
load a spear.  Oh no, he cried out to himself.  Watch out, Nick.  There was \par
nothing he could do.\par
\tab It happened so fast that neither Nick nor Troy knew exactly what occurred.  \par
Troy would later explain that he felt a sudden warm tingle on his wrist and then \par
something, a light beam or a laser burst or a stream of plasma perhaps, fired \par
out of his bracelet and zapped the robot sentry into silence and motionlessness.  \par
Nick would say that the sentry, just when it was going to fire at him, was first \par
distracted by Troy and then recoiled as if from an impact.  Whatever happened, \par
the sentry stopped all activity.  Immediately thereafter the two men swam \par
together over to the shallow part of the cave.  They were temporarily safe.\par
\par
\tab Carol could not believe how plump and succulent the oysters were.  Ellen \par
was sitting at the other end of the table opposite her, and was beaming with \par
pride.  "Would you like some more, dear?" she smiled, lifting the huge pot \par
containing the oyster stew.  I'm now going to eat a second portion, Carol \par
thought.  In addition to the catfish with Nick.  Greta would be disgusted.  She \par
smiled to herself and nodded at Ellen.  There was at least one thing she had \par
learned this evening.  Ellen was certainly a fantastic cook.\par
\tab And a very sad person too, Carol thought as she spooned herself some more \par
spicy stew rich with the fabled Appalachicola oysters.  Homer had personally \par
answered all the questions during the twenty-minute interview before dinner.  \par
Whenever a question had been controversial or delicate, such as when Carol had \par
asked about the allegations that part of the treasure haul had been secretly \par
stolen and hidden by the three of them, he had looked only at Greta before he \par
made a response.  No wonder Ellen eats all the time.  She's the odd man out.  Or \par
is it woman?\par
\tab "This stew is fabulous," Carol remarked to Ellen.  "Would you mind giving \par
me the recipe?"\par
\tab Ellen was delighted.  "Certainly, dear," she said, "it would be my \par
pleasure." Carol remembered Dale's reference to Ellen's behavior at the MOI \par
awards dinner and wondered if there was, indeed, any sexual component to the \par
warmth Ellen was displaying.  I don't see it, Carol decided.  This is just a \par
lonely and profoundly disturbed woman.  I don't feel one iota of sexual tension.\par
\tab "You've been asking the questions all evening, Miss Dawson," Homer was \par
saying.  "Now why don't we ask you a few?"  He had been surprisingly pleasant \par
and subdued since the bizarre preprandial shark feeding.  They must be normal \par
sometimes, Carol thought.  Otherwise they couldn't survive.  But who knows when \par
Mr. Hyde will show up again.\par
\tab "Ya," Greta said.  It was the first time she had spoken directly to Carol \par
during the meal.  "Homer told me you were with Dr. Dale.  You are lovers, no?"\par
\tab You don't beat around the bush, do you Greta.  Carol partially evaded the \par
question.  "Dale Michaels and I are very good friends.  We spend quite a lot of \par
time together, both socially and professionally."\par
\tab "He is a smart man," Greta said.  Those clear eyes stared at Carol and a \par
smile played at the corner of Greta's lips.  What is she trying to tell me?\par
\tab The conversation was interrupted by the sound of a sharp alarm.  Carol \par
knew immediately that something had gone wrong.  "What in the world is that?"  \par
Carol asked innocently as the strident alarm continued with its loud bursts.\par
\tab Homer and Greta were already up from the table.  "Excuse us," Homer said, \par
"it's our burglar alarm.  Probably an error.  We'll go check it out."\par
\tab They hurried out of the dining room, leaving Carol and Ellen alone, and \par
headed down a nearby hallway.  I must follow them and find out what's going on, \par
Carol thought, her heart and mind racing together.  She sneaked a peek at her \par
watch.  It was five minutes past ten o'clock.  They should have finished by now.  \par
"I'm going to the rest room," she said to Ellen.  "Don't bother," she added, as \par
Ellen started to explain the directions.  "I'm sure I can find it myself."\par
\tab Carol walked quickly into the hall and listened for sounds of Homer and \par
Greta.  Moving very quietly, she followed them until she was just outside a \par
large den on the opposite side of the house.  The door to the den was ajar.  "It \par
will focus in a second," she heard Homer say.  There was a pause.  "Shit," he \par
shouted, "it looks like the gold bars are already gone.  They must have moved \par
very fast .  .  .  The picture is really not very clear.  Here, you take a \par
look."\par
\tab "Ya," said Greta.  "The bars are gone, I think .  .  .  But Homer, the \par
gold would be very heavy.  Maybe the thieves are trapped in the tunnel .  .  .  \par
Timmy could search for them."\par
\tab "That would fix the bastards," Homer's nervous laugh sent chills down \par
Carol's spine.  She back pedaled slowly until she had retreated to the main \par
foyer of the house.  She heard an outside door slam in the direction of the den.  \par
They've gone out to turn the sharks loose.  Jesus.  I must warn Nick and Troy.\par
\tab Carol walked into the nearest bathroom in the hallway, pushed the door \par
closed, and turned on the water faucet.  Then she flushed the commode and \par
untaped the small walkie-talkie that was hidden inside her shirt.  She put the \par
unit right next to her mouth.  "Mayday, mayday," she said.  "They know you're \par
there.  You are in danger."  She repeated the message and then pushed the button \par
that would automatically recycle the communication several more times.  I \par
certainly hope this damn thing works, she thought.\par
\tab She started to affix the tiny unit to the inside of her blouse again.  \par
While she was taping it down, she happened to look in the mirror.  Her heart \par
nearly stopped.  Ellen was standing in the doorway, staring at her, the baleful \par
glare in her eyes indicating that she had seen and heard everything.  She took a \par
step toward Carol.\par
\tab "Just hold it right there, Ellen," Carol said.  Carol put her hands up.  \par
"I have no quarrel with you." The fat woman hesitated.  "Homer and Greta only \par
use you anyway," Carol added softly, "why don't you leave them and make a life \par
for yourself?"\par
\tab Anger broke across Ellen's face.  Her eyes narrowed, her cheeks reddened, \par
and she raised her huge fists to threaten Carol.  "It's none of your damn \par
business how I live my life," she said menacingly.  She moved again in Carol's \par
direction.\par
\tab Carol grabbed the thick metal towel rack beside her and pulled with all \par
her might.  The bar sprung free from the wall, dumping two peach bath towels and \par
a wooden end piece on the linoleum floor.  Carol brandished the bar over her \par
head.  "Don't make me hit you," she said.  "Just move aside and get out of my \par
way."\par
\tab Ellen did not slow down.  Carol aimed carefully and struck her hard, on \par
the right shoulder.  The heavy woman collapsed.\par
\tab "Greta," she wailed in a monstrous voice, "Greta, help me."\par
\tab Still waving the bar from the towel rack, Carol walked carefully around \par
Ellen and backed toward the door.  Once in the hall, she sprinted to the family \par
room and headed for the front door.  Right beside the wet bar she was tackled \par
from behind.  Carol fell forward, hard, and smashed her nose on the carpet.  She \par
tried to squirm out of Greta's arms but it was impossible.  She was pinned.  A \par
few drops of blood trickled out of Carol's nose and fell on the carpet.\par
\tab Both women were breathing heavily.  Carol managed to turn her body around \par
so that she was facing Greta.  She struggled vainly to free herself.  Greta's \par
strong arms slammed Carol's wrists against the floor.  Greta bent down until her \par
face was only inches away from Carol's.  "You were trying to get away, ya, and \par
just why vere you in such a hurry."\par
\tab There was something feral in Greta's eyes.  On impulse, Carol lifted her \par
head and kissed Greta, full on the lips.  Startled, her assailant's arms \par
momentarily relaxed.  That was all Carol needed.  Gathering all her strength, \par
she smashed the bottom of her palm into the side of Greta's head.  Greta was \par
stunned.  Carol pushed her off and made a dash for the door.\par
\tab Carol was already calculating when she ran out the front door and down the \par
steps.  Greta will be up in an instant, she thought.  I won't have time to open \par
the car door.  I might as well run for it.\par
\tab The German woman was only fifteen yards behind her, and gaining fast, when \par
Carol turned onto the lane that led from Homer's house to the Pelican Resort.  \par
For ten years I have run three times a week.  But this is the only time my life \par
has ever depended on it.  She tried to accelerate.  Greta continued to close the \par
gap.  Carol was certain she was going to be caught at any minute.  Once she \par
thought she felt Greta's hand on her blouse.\par
\tab But after two hundred yards Greta began to drop back.  When she was a \par
quarter of a mile from Homer's driveway Carol dared to look over her shoulder.  \par
Her pursuer was clearly struggling and was now fifty yards behind her.  Carol \par
felt a renewed burst of energy.  I'm going to make it, she thought.  I'm \par
actually going to escape.\par
\tab Greta slowed to a walk.  Eventually Carol did too, but not until she was \par
almost to the restaurant.  Even then she continued to look back, to try to find \par
her antagonist in the moonlight.  Now I'll call a taxi, she was thinking, And go \par
over to Nick's apartment.  I hope that the two of them heard my warning and are \par
safe.\par
\tab She could no longer see Greta.  She stopped and strained her eyes.  She \par
must have turned back, Carol thought.  While she was looking back down the lane, \par
a pair of very strong hands grabbed her shoulders.  She spun around and stared \par
into the laughing eyes of Lieutenant Richard Todd.\par

\par
HE had purposely waited until all the rest of the actors had left the dressing \par
room.  The package itself was inconspicuous, about the size of a large bar of \par
soap, wrapped in white paper with a dark red ribbon.  You don't even know if \par
it's from her, Winters thought as he pulled the bow on the ribbon.  The \par
commander was full of anticipation.  The show had been even better tonight.  And \par
in the bedroom scene he had felt, for just a second, the touch of Tiffani's \par
tongue against his lips.  She didn't have to do that, Winters told himself, \par
suspending for a moment all vestiges of guilt.\par
\tab His hands trembled a little as he opened the package.  It was a plain \par
white box.  Inside was a silver cigarette lighter simple but handsome, with the \par
initials VW engraved on the outside at the bottom.  His heart raced.  So she \par
does feel it too.  Commander Winters felt a powerful burst of lust in his groin.  \par
Now he was imagining a scene no more than three or four hours in the future.  He \par
was taking Tiffani home and they were kissing at her front door.  "Would you \par
like to come in," she would say .  .  .\par
\tab "I feel pretty .  .  .  oh so pretty .  .  .  I feel pretty and witty and \par
gay .  .  ." He heard her singing as she came down the hall.  She pushed open \par
the door to his dressing room and twirled around.  Tiffani's hair was stacked \par
high on her head showing the lines of her elegant neck.  The gold filigree along \par
the top of the comb that the commander had given her blended in perfectly with \par
the rich red and brown of her hair.  Her dress was white, low cut, with her \par
shoulders exposed except for tiny straps in the corners.\par
\tab "Well?" she said with a big and eager smile.  She turned around again.  \par
"What do you think?"\par
\tab "You look beautiful, Tiffani," he replied.  He stared at her with such \par
intensity that she blushed.\par
\tab "Oh, Vernon," she sighed, now changing her mood, "the combs are \par
wonderful." She pulled a cigarette from his pack on the dresser table and lit it \par
herself with his new lighter.  She took a deep drag, her eyes fixed on his, and \par
put the cigarette down in the ashtray.  "I don't know how to thank you," she \par
murmured.\par
\tab She walked over to him and put her hands in his.  "It's already been \par
another wonderful evening."  She put her left hand behind his head and reached \par
up to kiss him.  His heart was about to explode within his body.  She could feel \par
his arousal as her lips nestled softly against his.  She pulled his head down to \par
meet hers and subtly increased the pressure of her kiss.  At length he put his \par
arms around her and pressed her body against his.\par
\tab Commander Winters thought he was going to drown in the pleasure of that \par
kiss.  Never had he felt such longing.  He was certain he would gladly die in \par
the morning if he could just continue to kiss her all night first.  For a \par
moment, as he let himself experience fully the rush of joy and love and lust, \par
all his worries and despair were pushed aside.  He wanted to wrap himself around \par
Tiffani, somehow zip her inside his skin, and close out everything else in the \par
universe.\par
\tab Melvin and Marc had come to the dressing room to find the commander.  They \par
had not approached with stealth and were not even being especially quiet, but \par
neither Tiffani nor Commander Winters heard them walk up.  The two men could see \par
the pair kissing through the open dressing room door.  They looked at each other \par
and reached out instinctively to touch hands for an instant.  From their own \par
experience they knew about the difficulty of love affairs outside the accepted \par
norm.\par
\tab Tiffani and Winters finally broke the kiss and she put her head against \par
his chest.  Her back was to the door.  Winters opened his eyes and saw Melvin \par
and Marc standing there in front of him.  He blanched, but the director made a \par
gesture with his hands that said, "It's all right.  It's your business, not \par
ours."\par
\tab Melvin and Marc considerately waited several seconds so that it would look \par
as if they had not arrived until after the kiss.  The commander patted Tiffani \par
on the shoulder and turned her around in a fatherly manner.  "Great show, \par
Commander," Melvin said as he walked into the room.  "And another super \par
performance from you too, young lady."  He paused.  Marc smiled his compliments \par
and Tiffani unconsciously straightened out her dress.  "There's a Lieutenant \par
Todd waiting outside for you, Commander," Melvin added.  "He says it's urgent.  \par
He asked me to tell you to hurry."\par
\tab Winters face was creased with wrinkles.  What in the world is he doing \par
here?  he thought.  It's after ten o'clock on a Saturday night.  "Thanks, \par
Melvin," he answered.  "Tell him I'll be out in a few minutes."\par
\tab The director and his friend turned and left the dressing room.  Tiffani \par
reached over for the lit cigarette, whose ash had grown so long it had nearly \par
fallen out of the ashtray.  She inhaled and handed it to Winters.  "Did they see \par
us kissing?" she asked anxiously\par
\tab "No," lied Winters.  But already he was realizing how untenable his \par
fantasy was.  Precious Tiffani, he thought.  My teenage lover.  We were lucky.  \par
But we cannot kid ourselves.  We will be seen eventually.  He looked into her \par
eyes and saw the flame of adolescent passion.  Again he felt the surge in his \par
loins.  He reached down and pulled her forcefully to him.  And if the wrong \par
person sees us, he thought as his lips tingled with her kiss, there is no limit \par
to my risk.\par
\par
\tab Winters threw his cigarette down on the ground and stomped it out.  He \par
shook his head in disbelief.  "You are telling me that you have taken those \par
three into custody?  And you're holding them at the base?"\par
\tab Lieutenant Todd was confused.  "But sir, don't you understand?  We have an \par
entire set of photographs.  In three of them you can clearly see the missile.  \par
And there are other pictures that show the black guy in some kind of underwater \par
structure down there in the ocean.  Just as I had guessed.  What more could we \par
possibly need?  We also caught them, red-handed no less, coming back from a dive \par
with fifty pounds of gold bars in their backpacks.  Fifty pounds!"\par
\tab Commander Winters turned around and went back in the theater.  "Go back to \par
the base, Lieutenant," he said disgustedly.  "I'll be there in five minutes."\par
\tab It was apparent that Melvin and Marc were just waiting for Tiffani and the \par
commander before they locked up the theater and went to the party.  "Can you \par
take her over, Melvin?" he asked.  "There's a big mess out at the base tonight \par
and it looks as if I will have to straighten it out."  The conversation with \par
Todd had been sobering for Winters on at least two levels.  First, it had \par
reminded him that there was a real world out there, outside of the theater, a \par
world that would not look kindly on a forty-three-year-old Navy commander having \par
a sexual relationship with a seventeen-year-old high school student.  Secondly, \par
Todd's astonishing announcement that he had indeed detained three civilians, one \par
of whom was a well-known reporter, jolted the commander into realizing that his \par
preoccupation with Tiffani had affected his work.  I should never have let this \par
thing get so far out of control, he thought.  From here on out that lieutenant \par
makes no move that I don't personally approve.\par
\tab "I'm sorry, Tiffani," he said in a fatherly voice.  He gave her an \par
ambiguous hug and a light kiss on the top of her head.  "I'll come to the party \par
as soon as I can."\par
\tab "Hurry or you'll miss the champagne," Tiffani said with a smile.  Melvin \par
turned off the lights in the theater.  The four of them walked out the door.\par
\tab Winters had parked down the street almost a block away.  He waved to \par
Tiffani as she climbed into Melvin's car.  I wonder if you will ever know, young \par
lady, he thought.  Know how close I came tonight to throwing everything away.  \par
In his mind's eye it was twenty-four years before, on a cold night outside of \par
Philadelphia, and he had just gone berserk and virtually raped Joanna Carr.  \par
Winters started his Pontiac and eased into the street.  It would be so easy, he \par
thought.  Just one time to forget the rules and constraints.  To dive into the \par
water without looking first.  He remembered his pact with God after he had spent \par
the night with Joanna.  So You kept Your part of the bargain.  I guess And I \par
became an officer and a gentleman.  And a killer.\par
\tab He winced.  He turned the car past the swank Miyako Gardens and headed for \par
the base.  With great effort he forced himself to stop thinking about Tiffani \par
and Joanna and sex.  It's not enough that I have this trial with Tiffani.  At \par
the same time I am assigned a redneck lieutenant who runs roughshod over \par
civilians in his attempt to prove some cockamamie .  .  .\par
\tab Commander Winters stopped at a signal.  Slowly, the full impact of what \par
Todd had told him began to sink in.  Jesus.  I may be in trouble too.  Unlawful \par
entry.  Wrongful detention.  They'll throw the book at Todd .  .  .  He eased \par
his car through the intersection.  He mechanically put a cigarette in his mouth \par
and lit it.  So I should be apologetic.  But shit.  That Dawson woman is a \par
reporter.  Bad bad news.\par
\tab He had arrived at the base.  He waved to the security guard and drove on \par
to where Todd had said they were keeping the trio.  Winters stopped in front of \par
a plain white building situated on a small hill about fifteen feet above the \par
street level.  A nervous Lieutenant Roberto Ramirez was waiting at the edge of \par
the road.  He was holding two large, thick envelopes in his hands.  Ramirez \par
turned and called something toward the front door.  Todd came out in a moment.  \par
He locked the door carefully, came down the steps, and walked toward the other \par
two officers.  Ramirez was already showing the photographs to Commander Winters \par
when Todd joined them.  The three men had a short but animated discussion.\par
\par
\tab "So what happened after you received my message?"  Carol turned to the \par
other two as soon as Todd disappeared out the door.  They had not had many \par
chances to talk in private since Todd and Ramirez had taken them into custody in \par
the parking lot at the Pelican Resort.\par
\tab "Troy was ready to split," Nick laughed.  "But I thought your warning only \par
referred to the robot sentry.  And since he had been quiet for several minutes, \par
I figured we were already safe.  I was still really pissed off about the second \par
bag of gold bars.  So I hurried back over to the gate.\par
\tab "I was concentrating so hard on finding a way to pull the bag through the \par
opening that I must have been oblivious to everything else.  Suddenly I felt \par
Troy jerk me backwards.  Maybe a second later two or three sharks, one \par
definitely a mako, slammed hard into the gate.  I was certain the gate was going \par
to fall into pieces."\par
\tab "Those sharks were really nasty, angel," Troy interjected.  "And stupid \par
too.  The big one must have banged against the gate a dozen times before he gave \par
up."\par
\tab "The buoyancy bag with the gold bars was immediately ripped to shreds by \par
the crazy sharks.  They may even have swallowed most of the bars themselves.  It \par
was not fun being that close to them."  Nick shuddered.  "When I close my eyes I \par
can still see that mako's teeth three feet away from me.  I'll probably have bad \par
dreams for years."\par
\tab "I pulled Nick toward the ocean.  I didn't want any part of those mean \par
bastards and I didn't trust the gate to remain intact in case they launched \par
another attack.  We made it out in record time.  Of course, neither of us \par
expected to be greeted by the U.S. Navy when we returned to the station wagon."  \par
Troy paused.  "This Todd character, what's his problem any way?  He sure thinks \par
he's a bad ass.  Is he just pissed because the professor decked him last night?"\par
\tab Carol smiled.  She reached her left hand over and put it on Nick's leg \par
just above the knee.  Her hand remained there while she was talking.  "Todd is \par
one of the naval engineers trying to find the lost missile.  I'm certain that he \par
and his men must have been responsible for the break-ins at Nick's apartment and \par
my hotel room.  Otherwise they wouldn't have detained us."\par
\tab "What grounds do they have for holding us?"  Nick inquired.  He dropped \par
his hand down and wrapped it around Carol's.  "It's not against the law to have \par
gold bars in a backpack.  Don't we have rights as citizens that prevent this \par
kind of thing?"\par
\tab "Probably," Carol replied.  She squeezed Nick's hand and then retracted \par
her own.  "But as a reporter, I find this part of our adventure extremely \par
interesting.  You can tell that Lieutenant Ramirez is very nervous.  He wouldn't \par
let Todd even ask us any questions until Commander Winters was contacted.  And \par
he has been very concerned about our comfort."\par
\tab As if on cue, the front door opened and the three naval officers walked \par
in.  Winters was in the lead with the two lieutenants just behind.  Nick and \par
Carol and Troy were sitting on gray metal auditorium chairs on the left of a \par
partitioned area that served as a waiting room for the larger offices in the \par
rear of the building.  Winters moved into the area and half leaned against the \par
large gray desk opposite them.\par
\tab "I'm Commander Vernon Winters," he said, his eyes meeting each of theirs \par
in turn.  "As Miss Dawson knows, I'm one of the senior officers on the base \par
here.  I am currently in charge of a secret project, code named Broken Arrow."  \par
He smiled.  "I'm sure you are wondering why you have been brought to the base."\par
\tab Winters reached out with his left arm and Ramirez handed him the infrared \par
blowups that showed the missile in the most detail.  He waved the photos at the \par
three detainees.  "One of the goals of project Broken Arrow is to find a Navy \par
missile that has been lost somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico.  Lieutenant Todd \par
here believes, based on these photographs, that you know where that missile is.  \par
That is why he has acted to bring you here for questioning."  Winters' voice \par
rose in pitch and he began to wave his arms.  "Now I'm certain I don't need to \par
remind you that state-of-the-art weapons systems are what keep our nation free \par
and secure \emdash  "\par
\tab "Spare us the patriotic lecture and the histrionics, Commander Winters," \par
interrupted Carol.  "We all know that you are searching for a lost missile and \par
that you think we may have found it.  Sorry.  We went out looking for it today \par
but were unable to locate it again."  She stood up.  "Now you listen to me a \par
minute.  Your zealous lieutenant there and his men have broken more laws than I \par
can count.  In addition to kidnapping us, they have looted and vandalized my \par
hotel room and Mr. Williams' apartment.  They have also stolen some photographs \par
and valuable equipment."  She fixed Winters with a hard gaze.  "You sure as hell \par
better have good reason for dragging us down here or I swear I'll see to it that \par
all three of you are court martialed."\par
\tab Carol glanced at Ramirez.  He was squirming.  "In the meantime," she \par
continued, "you can start by giving us an official, written apology, returning \par
all our property, and making adequate payment for all the damages.  In addition \par
I want exclusive access to all Broken Arrow files from this moment on.  If you \par
don't agree to all these terms, you might as well prepare right now to read \par
about the Gestapo tactics of the United States Navy in the next edition of the \par
Miami Herald."\par
\tab Uh oh, thought Winters.  This is not going to be easy.  This woman \par
reporter intends to play the bluff and threat game.  He pulled out a cigarette \par
while he was thinking.  "Would you please not smoke in here?"  Carol broke into \par
his train of thought.  "We all find it offensive."\par
\tab Damn these aggressive nonsmokers.  He replaced the Pall Mall in the pack \par
in his pocket.  Winters had been thrown off at first by Carol's rapid attack, \par
but he eventually regained his composure.  "Now, Miss Dawson," the commander \par
began a minute later.  He looked away from the trio, in the direction of the \par
front door.  "I can understand why you might be upset by what has happened.  I \par
will admit that our men may indeed have acted in an unwarranted manner while \par
they were searching your rooms to find evidence.  However .  .  ."  Winters \par
stopped in mid-sentence, turned around, and came back toward Nick and Carol and \par
Troy.\par
\tab "However," he repeated.  "We are talking about treason here."  He waited \par
to let his threat register.  "And I don't need to tell you, Miss Dawson, that \par
treason is serious business.  Even more serious than journalism."  He hesitated \par
again for effect and his voice became very stern.  "If any of you have knowledge \par
of the whereabouts of this missile and have conveyed that knowledge to a member \par
of any foreign government, especially one viewed as inimical to our national \par
interests, then you have committed treason."\par
\tab "What kind of dope have you been smoking, Commander?"  Carol replied.  "We \par
freely admit that we've been looking for your missile.  But that doesn't make us \par
spies.  You have no case against us."  She glanced at Nick.  He was admiring her \par
performance.  "I'm simply a reporter covering a story.  This treason business of \par
yours is pure fabricated bullshit."\par
\tab "Oh, yeah," said Lieutenant Todd, unable to restrain himself.  "Then where \par
were these pictures taken?"  He showed the photo of Troy in full diving regalia \par
in the initial underwater room with the red and blue walls.  He then turned and \par
pointed to the backpacks sitting in the opposite corner of the room.  "And what \par
were your two friends doing with fifty pounds of gold after their dive tonight?"\par
\tab "All right, man," Troy remarked in an exaggerated manner.  He took a step \par
toward Lieutenant Todd.  "All right.  You've figured it out, haven't you?  We \par
found the missile and sold it to the Russians for fifty pounds of gold."  His \par
eyes widened as he looked at Todd.  "And now the missile is onboard a submarine \par
on its way to Moscow or wherever .  .  .  Come on, man, get serious.  We're not \par
that stupid."\par
\tab Lieutenant Todd's temper flared up.  "You black bastard \emdash  " he muttered \par
before Commander Winters jumped between them.  Winters needed some time to \par
think.  Todd's questions were after all.  still unanswered.  Even if there were \par
good answers, it was not difficult to understand how someone could have come to \par
the conclusion, based on the photographs, that there might be a conspiracy \par
involved.\par
\tab In addition, there was the issue of defending the actions of his junior \par
officers and the investigating team.  If I let these three go now, thought \par
Winters, then we are essentially admitting that we made an error in the first \par
place .  .  .  Ramirez was gesturing at the commander.  He nodded outside with \par
his head.  Winters did not understand at first, but Ramirez repeated the motion.\par
\tab "Excuse us a second," Winters said.  The two officers walked out on the \par
porch above the steps, leaving Todd with Nick and Carol and Troy.  "What is it, \par
Lieutenant?"  Winters asked\par
\tab "Commander, sir," Ramirez answered, "my career is the Navy.  If we release \par
these three now, after no formal questioning \emdash  "\par
\tab "I couldn't agree more," Winters interrupted abruptly.  "I wish that none \par
of this today had happened.  But it did.  Now we must finish it up properly and \par
thoroughly or we have no defense for what we did."  He thought for a minute.  \par
"How long would it take you to get the video and sound equipment set up for a \par
formal interrogation?"\par
\tab "About thirty minutes," Ramirez replied.  "Maybe forty-five at the most."\par
\tab "Let's do it.  While you're getting ready, I'll prepare the list of \par
questions."\par
\tab Shit, said Winters to himself as he watched Ramirez walk briskly toward \par
his office on the other side of the base.  I am indeed going to be here all \par
night.  He thought of his missed chance with Tiffani .  I'd better call her and \par
explain while I'm drafting these questions.  He felt a sudden burst of anger \par
toward Lieutenant Todd.  As for you, he thought, if we come out of this \par
unscathed, I will personally see to it that you are transferred to Lower \par
Slobbovia.\par
\par
\tab It was after eleven o'clock.  Lieutenant Todd stood near the front door.  \par
He was holding a billy club in his hand.  Once before in the evening, just after \par
Nick and Troy had reached the Pelican Resort parking lot, Todd had used the club \par
on Nick's back to coerce him into the car.  Nick could still feel the welt.\par
\tab "How long is all this going to take?"  Troy asked.  He was standing near \par
the desk.  "Can't we go home now and get some sleep and come back on Monday \par
morning .  .  ."\par
\tab "You heard what the man said," Todd replied.  He was definitely gloating.  \par
"They've gone off to prepare for a formal interrogation.  You should be using \par
this time to get your story straight."  Todd pounded his palm with the billy \par
club.\par
\tab Troy turned to his companions.  "All right, team," he said with a wink.  \par
"I move we blow this joint.  Let's overpower this geek and blast out of here."\par
\tab "Just try it, you shits," Todd rejoined.  He smacked one of the empty \par
folding chairs with his club for emphasis.  "I'd like nothing better than to \par
report that you tried to escape."\par
\tab Nick had not said much since Winters and Ramirez had left.  He now looked \par
across the room at Todd.  "You know what annoys me the most about this, \par
Lieutenant?" he said to his captor.  "It's that people like you," he continued, \par
without waiting for an answer, "end up in positions of power or authority all \par
over the world.  Look at you.  You think that because you have us under your \par
control, that makes you somebody.  Let me tell you something.  You aren't shit."\par
\tab Todd did not try to hide his dislike for Nick.  "At least I can find white \par
men to be my friends," he replied sarcastically.\par
\tab "I do declare," Troy chimed in swiftly.  "I believe our associate \par
Lieutenant Todd may be a bigot.  We may be talking to a true life honky.  Let's \par
see if 'nigger' is his next \emdash  "\par
\tab "Boys, boys," Carol interceded as Todd started to move toward Troy.  \par
"Enough is enough.  "The room became quiet.  Troy walked back over to his \par
friends and sat down in his chair.\par
\tab A minute later Troy leaned over to Nick and Carol.  As he was whispering \par
to them, he put the gold bracelet right next to his mouth.  "You know, folks," \par
he said, "if we don't get out of here soon, we may be here all night.  I can \par
well imagine the questions taking three or four hours.  And that means the Navy \par
will get to the dive site before us in the morning."\par
\tab "But what can we do?"  Carol asked.  "It would be a miracle if they let us \par
just walk out without any questions."\par
\tab "A miracle, angel."  said Troy with a grin, "is just what we need.  A good \par
old-fashioned miracle.  Like the blue fairy."\par
\tab "What are you shits whispering about over there?"  The truculent \par
Lieutenant Todd began to walk toward the bathroom at the west end of the long \par
room.  "Knock it off.  And don't try anything.  The outside door is locked and I \par
have the key."  He didn't close the bathroom door.  The urinal was fortunately \par
out of view to the right.\par
\tab There was not much light in the back of the small bathroom.  As Todd was \par
finishing his piss, he became aware of a strange sensation all over his right \par
side, as if a thousand very small needles were sticking in him.  Puzzled, he \par
turned toward the corner.  What he saw there sent an incredible shock of terror \par
racing through his system.\par
\tab In the corner, partially hidden in the poor light, was what could only be \par
described as a six-foot carrot.  The thicker end of the creature was balanced on \par
four webbed pads planted on the floor.  There were no arms, but about five feet \par
above the ground, just under a maze of blue spaghetti of unknown purpose on top \par
of its "head," four vertical slits, each a foot long, were cut in what might \par
have been its face.  Out of each of these slits something strange was hanging.  \par
Troy would later explain to Nick and Carol that these were sensors, that the \par
carrot saw, heard, smelled, and tasted with these dangling extensions.\par
\tab Lieutenant Todd did not wait to study the creature.  He let out a whoop \par
and backed quickly out of the bathroom.  He did not stop to retract his penis or \par
zip his fly.  When the weird orange thing next appeared in the light at the door \par
to the bathroom, The lieutenant was certain it was going to follow him.  He \par
stared at it, petrified and immobile, for half a second.  Then, when it did \par
indeed move toward him, Todd immediately turned around, unlocked the front door, \par
and burst through it.\par
\par
\tab Unfortunately he forgot about the eight concrete steps.  In his panic he \par
tripped and fell.  He smacked his head hard on the second step and tumbled down \par
to the bottom.  He lay unconscious on his back on the sidewalk in front of the \par
building.\par
\tab Carol had cowered against Nick when she had first seen the carrot.  Then \par
they had both glanced at Troy.  He was smiling and humming to himself, "When you \par
wish upon a star .  .  .  makes no difference who you are."  He seemed so blase \par
about everything that Nick and Carol even relaxed temporarily.  However, after \par
Lieutenant Todd disappeared out the front door and the carrot turned to face \par
them, it was difficult to remain calm.\par
\tab "Nuts," said Troy with a big smile.  "I was really hoping for the blue \par
fairy.  I thought she might make me rich, or maybe even white."\par
\tab "All right, Jefferson," Nick said.  His face looked as if he had just \par
eaten a lemon.  "Please explain what that thing in front of us is."\par
\tab Troy first walked slowly over to the corner of the room to pick up their \par
backpacks.  "This, Professor," he replied as he then walked directly up to the \par
carrot, "is what we might call a holographic projection."  He put his hand into \par
and through the orange body.  "Somewhere in the universe there is supposedly a \par
real life creature like this, but they have only sent his image to help us \par
escape."\par
\tab Even with Troy's explanation Nick and Carol did not want to come any \par
closer to the stationary carrot than was absolutely necessary.  They moved with \par
their backs against the walls until they reached the door.  "Don't worry," Troy \par
laughed.  "It won't hurt you."\par
\tab The sensor hanging out of the slit on the far right of the carrot's head \par
was totally incomprehensible.  Carol could not take her eye off of it.  It \par
looked like a wad of gooey honeycomb stuck on the end of a majorette's baton.  \par
"What does it do with that?" Carol asked, pointing as she preceded Troy out the \par
door.\par
\tab "I don't know, angel," Troy answered.  "But it must be fun."\par
\tab Nick and Troy joined Carol on the platform at the top of the stairs They \par
all saw Todd at about the same time.  They were naturally surprised to find him \par
lying at the bottom of the steps.  His head was bleeding.  "Should we help him?"  \par
Carol wondered out loud as Troy bounded down the stairs in front of her.\par
\tab "No way," Nick replied quickly.\par
\tab Troy bent down beside Todd and carefully examined the unconscious \par
lieutenant from head to toe.  He slapped the big man lightly on the cheek.  \par
Lieutenant Todd did not move.  Troy winked at his friends at the top of the \par
stairs.  "The professor was right, my man," he said, breaking into a grin, "you \par
really aren't shit."\par
\par
\tab "So I kissed her," Carol said with a laugh.\par
\tab "You did what?" asked Nick.  They were in Troy's old Ford LTD. driving \par
toward the Hemingway marina.  After leaving the base they had walked the mile \par
and a half to Troy's duplex to pick up his car.  Carol was beside Troy in the \par
front seat and Nick was in the back next to the backpacks containing the gold \par
and the information discs.\par
\tab Carol turned around to Nick.  "I kissed her."  She laughed again as Nick \par
screwed up his face in disgust.  "What was I supposed to do?  The woman is \par
stronger than most men.  She had me pinned on the floor.  There was something \par
just a little suggestive about the way she was holding me .  .  ."\par
\tab "Whoooee, angel," Troy slapped the dashboard with his left hand.  "You are \par
amazing.  What did superkraut do next?"\par
\tab "She released her grip on my wrists.  Just for a second.  I think she was \par
deciding whether to kiss me back."\par
\tab "Yuch," said Nick from the back seat.  "I think I'm going to be sick."\par
\tab "So you smashed her up side of the head and then ran off?" asked Troy.  \par
Carol nodded.  Troy laughed heartily and then became more serious.  "Be careful \par
if you ever see her again, angel.  Greta does not like to lose."\par
\tab "But you're wrong about her in one respect, Carol," Nick remarked.  \par
"Greta's not into women at all.  She likes sex with men too much."\par
\tab Carol found Nick's comment smug and even irritating.  She spoke across the \par
front seat to Troy.  "Why is it, Troy, that men naturally assume that any woman \par
who has sexual relations with men could not possibly be interested in having sex \par
with another woman?  Is this another example of their fundamental belief in \par
their own innate superiority?"  She didn't wait for an answer.  Carol turned \par
around again to talk to Nick.  "And in case you're wondering, the answer is no, \par
I'm not a lesbian.  I am relentlessly heterosexual, as much because of my San \par
Fernando Valley middle class background as anything.  But I will admit that \par
sometimes I grow extremely tired of men and what I call their baboon \par
demonstrations of macho."\par
\tab "Hey," Nick replied, "I didn't mean to start an argument.  I was just \par
suggesting \emdash  "\par
\tab "Okay, okay," Carol interrupted, loosening up a bit, "no harm done.  I \par
guess I am a little quick on the trigger."  She was quiet for a few seconds.  \par
"By the way, Nick," she remarked then, "there's one part of this that I still \par
don't understand completely.  Why did Captain Homer go to such great lengths to \par
hide the rest of the treasure all this time?  Why didn't he just sell it off as \par
soon as he could?"\par
\tab "Lots of reasons," Nick replied.  "Not the least of which was fear that he \par
might somehow be discovered and indicted for the perjury he committed during our \par
trial.  But this way he also escapes the IRS, the value of the gold appreciates \par
in time, and, most importantly, Greta has to hang around if she wants her whole \par
share.  He almost certainly converts some of it to cash from time to time, \par
probably through a third party.  But never enough to call attention to the \par
transaction."\par
\tab "So you see, angel," Troy said, "that's why there's no way he can call the \par
police.  Because he would have to admit everything.  I bet he's really pissed \par
off."\par
\tab Troy pulled into a left-hand turn lane and waited for the signal to \par
change.  A car pulled up beside them on the right, next to Carol, and she just \par
happened to look idly in that direction.  It was a Mercedes.\par
\tab Later on Carol would recall that time seemed to dilate for her.  Each \par
second of the next minute was recorded in her memory in super slow motion, as if \par
it were covering a much longer period of time.  Greta was driving Captain \par
Homer's car and was staring at Carol.  Homer was sitting beside her, waving his \par
fists, shouting something that Carol couldn't hear through her closed window.  \par
Carol focused on Greta's amazing eyes.  Never had she seen such hatred.  For \par
just an instant Carol looked away to alert Troy and Nick.  When she turned back \par
she saw that Greta had a pistol pointed directly at her.\par
\tab Three things happened almost simultaneously.  Carol ducked, Troy pulled \par
into the intersection against the red light, barely missing a speeding car, and \par
Greta fired the gun.  The bullet ripped through Carol's window and crashed into \par
Troy's door, somehow miraculously missing them both.  Carol sat cringing under \par
the dashboard in the front seat.  She fought against panic and tried to catch \par
her breath.\par
\tab The chase was on.  It was after eleven-thirty on a Saturday night in Key \par
West and the traffic in the residential area was light.  Troy's Ford was no \par
match for the Mercedes.  Twice more Greta maneuvered into position and the Ford \par
was sprayed with bullets.  Windows were broken and pitted but none of the \par
occupants of the car was injured.\par
\tab Nick was lying on the floor in the back seat.  "Get down-town if you can," \par
he shouted at Troy.  "Maybe we can lose them in the traffic."\par
\tab Troy was hunkered down behind the steering wheel as far as he could go.  \par
He could barely see the roadway in front of them.  He was driving like a \par
lunatic, swerving across the four-lane street into oncoming traffic, honking \par
frantically, and making it impossible for Greta to predict his next move.  \par
"Where are the cops when you really need them?" he said out loud.  "We have \par
maniacs firing guns at us in the middle of Key West and there are no men of blue \par
anywhere in sight."\par
\tab After Nick's suggestion Troy suddenly spun around in the middle of the \par
street and started heading in the opposite direction.  Greta was not prepared.  \par
She hit the brakes on the Mercedes, went into a skid, caromed off a parked car, \par
and then resumed the chase.\par
\tab There were now no cars on the street in front of them and the Mercedes was \par
closing the gap.  "Uh oh," said Troy, fearing another attack.  He violently \par
pulled the steering wheel to the left, shot through an alley, into a parking \par
lot, and back onto a narrow street.  A few moments later he made a quick turn \par
into a driveway.  The car became flooded with light and Troy jammed on the \par
brakes.  "Everybody out," he hollered.  While Nick and Carol were trying to \par
determine what the hell was happening, Troy was giving his car keys to a tall \par
figure dressed in a red uniform.\par
\tab "We're just having drinks," he said.  They heard the screech of the brakes \par
on the Mercedes.  "And those people behind us," Troy said in a loud voice to the \par
half dozen onlookers, including two parking attendants, who were standing \par
nearby, "have guns and are trying to kill us."\par
\tab It was too late for Greta and Homer to escape.  Troy had driven into the \par
parking entrance of the Miyako Gardens Hotel and already another car had come \par
into the circular drive behind the Mercedes.  Greta threw the car in reverse, \par
smashed against the grill and bumper of the Jaguar behind her, and then tried to \par
make a run for it by squeezing around Troy's Ford.  Troy and the uniformed \par
attendant dove for cover as Greta hit the open door of the Ford, lost control of \par
the Mercedes, and eventually crashed into the parking kiosk in the middle of the \par
driveway.  As Nick and Carol stumbled out of the car, four hotel security men \par
surrounded Greta and Homer.\par
\tab Troy walked over to join his friends.  "Anybody hurt?"  Both Carol and \par
Nick shook their heads.  Troy broke into a grand smile.  "I guess that ought to \par
take care of those characters," he said.\par
\tab Carol gave him a hug.  "It was a brilliant idea to drive here," she said.  \par
"What made you think of it?"\par
\tab "Birds," Troy answered.\par
\tab "Birds?"  Nick responded.  "What the fuck are you talking about, \par
Jefferson?"\par
\tab "Well, Professor," said Troy, opening the door to the elegant hotel and \par
following his colleagues inside into the open atrium, "when they were about to \par
catch us that last time, I realized that they were probably going to kill us for \par
stealing their gold.  And I wondered if there really were birds in heaven.  My \par
mother always told me that there were."\par
\tab "Troy," Carol said with a smile, "you are so full of shit.  Come to the \par
point."\par
\tab "Exactly, angel," he answered.  "Look around you." In the atrium of the \par
Miyako Gardens was a magnificent aviary whose tiny, threaded wire rose four \par
stories into the air under a bank of skylights.  Hundreds of colored birds \par
played among the vines and palm trees and brought the real sound and feel of the \par
tropics to the lobby of the hotel.\par
\tab "When I thought about birds," Troy could no longer restrain a crazy laugh, \par
"I realized we were in the vicinity of this hotel and the plan sort of jumped \par
into my mind."\par
\tab The three of them stood together and gazed up at the aviary.  Carol was in \par
the middle.  She reached out her hands to both men.\par
\par
\par
REPATRIATION\par
\par
BENEATH the emerald-green ocean the spacecraft rests quietly.  Odd fishlike \par
creatures swim by, observe the visitor from the heavens, and then continue on \par
their journey.  The final checkout before deployment is underway.  When the \par
checkout is completed, a door near the bottom of the craft opens and a gold \par
metallic sphere with a diameter of about five inches appears.  The sphere is \par
tied down on top of a long, narrow platform.  The treads underneath the platform \par
propel it down a small ramp and then across the sandy ocean floor.\par
\tab The flatbodied vehicle and its cargo disappear in the distance.  After a \par
long wait the strange moving platform returns to the spaceship without the \par
golden sphere.  The ramp slides back into the vehicle, the door closes, and the \par
spacecraft is prepared for launch.  Soon thereafter the great ship eases forward \par
in the water, rising until it is just beneath the surface of the emerald ocean.  \par
It then reconfigures itself, adds wings, steerable flaps, and other control \par
devices, and breaks the water looking temporarily like an airplane.  Its ascent \par
into the blue sky filled with light from the twin suns is rapid and \par
breathtaking.  Orbital velocity is reached in almost no time.  Once in orbit \par
above the atmosphere the aerodynamic surfaces are retracted and the spaceship \par
makes one final voyage around the planet Canthor.  When it reaches the proper \par
true anomaly of its orbit, the craft accelerates quickly and hurtles again \par
toward the cold and dark of interstellar space.  The third delivery has been \par
completed; nine more remain on its sixty-millicycle mission.\par
\tab Three millicycles pass.  The next target planet is only six systems away, \par
another oceanic planet orbiting around a solitary yellow sun of unusual \par
stability.  The fourth cradle will be deposited there, on the third body away \par
from the star, a planet whose period of motion about its central sun is so short \par
that it makes fourteen revolutions in one millicycle.\par
\tab Before reaching the target, the spaceship makes a detour.  It dives deep \par
into the hydrogen-rich atmosphere of the largest planet in the new system, \par
thereby accomplishing two goals.  Its velocity with respect to the central star \par
is significantly slowed through conversion of kinetic energy to dissipated heat, \par
and its reservoir of raw elements and primitive chemical compounds, from which \par
the onboard manufacturing equipment creates all the backup and replacement \par
parts, is partially replenished.  After exiting from the dive into the thick \par
atmosphere.  the interstellar voyager covers the final distance to its target in \par
a leisurely six hundred nanocycles.\par
\tab During the approach, the automatic software in the central computer goes \par
through a well-tested sequence designed to discover whether any of the \par
conditions on the target planet have changed since the last complete set of \par
systematic observations three cycles ago since the contents of each cradle have \par
been uniquely designed, based upon the environment of the specific planet where \par
the zygotes must grow and flourish, any major change in that environment could \par
drastically reduce the probability of survival for the repatriated species.  \par
Upon command from the computer, a battery of advanced remote sensing instruments \par
is deployed to confirm the original design specifications for the planet.\par
\tab But the instruments do not, as planned, validate the set of design \par
assumptions.  The environment has changed.  Not markedly, not as if it had been \par
reworked on a massive scale by an advanced intelligence for some specific \par
purpose.  The initial data strongly suggests instead that during the last cycle \par
or two some indigenous intelligence has emerged that has had a nontrivial impact \par
on both the planet's surface and its atmosphere.\par
\tab As the remote sensing instruments continue their survey of the target \par
planet, something even more unusual is discovered.  There are artificial \par
satellites, thousands of them, in orbit around the body.  A spacefaring species \par
now makes this planet its home.  An alarm is triggered in the central computer \par
of the spaceship.  The zygotes and the cradle system destined for this planet \par
were not designed to deal with any other advanced species.\par
\tab However, the brilliant engineers of the Colony had anticipated that at \par
least one of the dozen target planets might have changed significantly during \par
the three cycles since the last regular observations.  A contingency protocol \par
for handling new situations has been programmed into the approach sequence.  \par
Essentially, this protocol calls for careful analysis of the new conditions on \par
the planet, assessment of the impact of those conditions on the key probability \par
of survival parameters, and then, assuming that the impact assessment is not \par
unsatisfactory, transfer, where possible, of new information into the electronic \par
infrastructure responsible for the education of the repatriated species after \par
cradle deployment.\par
\tab One of the special subroutines in the contingency protocol handles the \par
surprise emergence of a new spacefaring species.  The first action in the \par
sequence is the examination of one of the orbiting satellites to assess its \par
technological sophistication.  With great care the interstellar spaceship eases \par
into a rendezvous position with one of the artificial satellites that remain \par
mostly stationary above a single region on the rotating planet below.  Using \par
superfast burst algorithms stored in the communications macro, the spacecraft \par
searches for and establishes the command and telemetry frequencies of its \par
neighbor.  But attempts to actually command the satellite fail, suggesting an \par
elaborate protective code embedded in the receivers and/or a complicated \par
redundant command procedure.\par
\tab Without being able to command the satellite and thus assess its \par
capabilities, the visiting spaceship cannot conclusively establish the \par
technological stage of the new spacefaring species.  The contingency protocol \par
calls, in this situation, for trying to "capture" the satellite to perform in \par
situ analysis, provided there is no obvious danger from devices onboard the \par
satellite itself.  This particular branch in the software logic for the \par
spaceship was the subject of intense debate by the oversight board of the \par
Committee of Engineers back during the design process several cycles earlier.  \par
Many of the more experienced engineers thought that it was risky to include such \par
a logic loop, primarily because of the possibility that a paranoid emerging \par
culture might arm their satellites with destructive devices that could not be \par
easily recognized and disarmed.\par
\tab However, it was argued, on the basis of historical evidence from \par
throughout the galaxy, that since most incipient civilizations abolish warfare \par
and aggression before they become spacefaring, absence of a clearly identifiable \par
destruct or protective device was sufficient additional evidence to allow the \par
careful capturing and dismantling of a satellite.  And everyone agreed that the \par
detailed information about the technological status of the new species that \par
would result from such "reverse engineering" would be extremely valuable in \par
completing the assessment of the risk to the repatriated species.\par
\tab Great remote manipulator arms extend from the spacecraft, seize the \par
surveillance satellite, and pull it into a large room with vaulted ceilings.  An \par
army of small electronic robots attacks it at once, scurrying all over its \par
surface with probes and attachments.  Trillions of bits of data about the \par
satellite are fed into the primary data storage device in the spaceship \par
computer.  The new spacefarers are not very advanced technically.  In fact, the \par
computer algorithm concludes, it is very surprising that they have even mastered \par
launching and maintaining so many satellites.\par
\tab An explosion starts to rip through the room.  An astonishing sequence of \par
events takes place almost instantaneously after the explosion, as the spaceship \par
deploys its protective resources to stop the spread of the fireball and mitigate \par
the damage caused by the small nuclear device that has vaporized its host \par
satellite.  The explosion is quickly contained by unknown techniques, but not \par
until considerable destruction has been caused onboard the interstellar craft.\par
\tab An elaborate self-test occupies the great spaceship after the explosion.  \par
Detailed computer analysis of the damage indicates that the probability of \par
successfully deploying the cradles at the additional eight planets would be \par
measurably increased if the mission were temporarily interrupted to allow some \par
repair processes to take place.  A safe haven to conduct the repair operations, \par
in a known environment with very few variations is the concomitant requirement.  \par
The master computer decides, based on the system and subsystem constraints that \par
must he applied during the repairs, that the shallow ocean floor on this target \par
planet is a perfect place for such a hiatus in the mission plan.\par
\par
\tab The spaceship descends into the atmosphere, again reconfiguring itself to \par
expose a set of aerodynamic control surfaces.  During its rapid descent, the \par
flight path is crossed by a bullet-shaped vehicle that has just been released \par
from a high altitude airplane.  The spaceship approaches and then flies \par
alongside the missile.  The missile telemetry is intercepted by the spaceship \par
and correlated with the types of downlink data extracted from the satellite \par
earlier.  The spaceship computer uses its enormous processing capability and \par
cross-correlation algorithms to try to break the command code of the tiny \par
missile.  Eventually it is successful and the visitor is able to interact with \par
the guided projectile.\par
\tab The spaceship commands the missile to read out its guidance subroutines.  \par
Performing quadrillions of computations per second, the intelligent computer at \par
the heart of the interstellar craft deduces the targeting strategy for the \par
missile.  A target image that would result in the missile landing in the ocean, \par
close to the chosen location for the space vehicle, is commanded into the \par
missile's guidance algorithm The spacecraft and missile plunge in tandem into \par
the Gulf of Mexico.\par
\tab The two vehicles come to rest about two miles apart on the ocean floor.  \par
Within the carefully coded fault protection software of the great spaceship, \par
which took over operation of the craft immediately after the explosion of the \par
satellite, four separate activities are being conducted in parallel.  One of the \par
processors is sorting through the data archives associated with this particular \par
planet to determine what possible indigenous species could have gone through an \par
evolutionary burst and become spacefaring with such rapidity.  Coupled with this \par
first set of computations is an evaluation of the impact of such a local \par
advanced intelligence on the survivability of the repatriated zygotes.  Among \par
the questions addressed by the evaluation is what active steps can be taken by \par
the spaceship now to increase the likelihood of successful embryo germination \par
and development.\par
\tab A third processor in the central computer performs a thorough, detailed \par
analysis of the spacecraft state, including careful assessments of repair \par
techniques and materials needed to fix each and every damaged component.  The \par
fourth major parallel subroutine directs the effort of the small flat robots \par
that go out into the ocean, first to verify that the nearby missile is harmless \par
and can be safely brought back to the ship, and second to catalogue all the \par
flora and fauna in the neighborhood in case any kind of camouflage becomes \par
necessary.\par
\tab The carpets bring the missile to the spaceship for additional analysis.  \par
No major new insights are gleaned from this study.  The engineering similarities \par
between the missile and the earlier artificial satellite are simply catalogued \par
in the data archives.  The concurrent spaceship damage assessment concludes that \par
all the raw materials and tools necessary for the repairs are available except \par
for the proper quantities of lead and gold both of which are difficult and time-\par
consuming to make in the transmuter.  If somehow enough additional lead and gold \par
can be found, then the spaceship can be ready to leave this planet in three \par
local days; if the spaceship has to make the lead and gold by itself, including \par
leaching the elements in trace amounts from the ocean around it, then the total \par
repair effort might take as long as thirty days.\par
\tab The other two processors reach some equally interesting probabilistic \par
conclusions.  Mostly based upon the data taken during the endangered species \par
roundup seven cycles earlier, two separate types of animals, one land-based and \par
one water-based, are identified as the only possible candidates for the \par
evolutionary burst that produced spacefarers in such a short time.  Actually, \par
according to the computer, if the land-based human beings survived their earlier \par
nadir (around the time when some specimens were removed by the zoo ships of the \par
Colony) and did not become extinct, they had by far the better chance of \par
becoming the space voyager, especially in view of the results of the experiments \par
conducted on them at the Zoo Complex.  But if, indeed, the descendants of those \par
bipedal, upright, aggressive creatures have become spacefarers, the processor \par
warns, then the chances for survival to maturity by the zygotes in the cradle \par
are extremely low.  Unless somehow significant design changes in the cradle can \par
be made on the spot or the development of the repatriates can be kept a secret \par
from the humans for as long as a millicycle.\par
\tab More worrisome for the extraterrestrial spaceship from the point of view \par
of the overall mission is the tentative conclusion that it may well be \par
discovered by the intelligent and potentially hostile inhabitants of the target \par
planet in a comparatively short period of time.  If discovered and seriously \par
threatened, the spaceship could depart from the planet quickly and search for \par
another haven to make repairs; however, traveling in the space environment in \par
its current damaged state would be very risky.  Another option would be for the \par
spacecraft to send its own robots to the mines on this planet to extract the \par
lead and gold that would virtually guarantee safe arrival at the next target, \par
where the heavy metals are plentiful.\par
\tab In either case, premature discovery by uncooperative Earthlings would \par
almost certainly doom the zygote cradle that would be left on the Earth, if it \par
is known that the cradle system came from the alien spacecraft.  Thus the first \par
action that the spaceship takes is to check out, deploy, and then hide the Earth \par
cradle away from the vehicle.  The carpets locate a sequestered spot six or \par
seven hundred yards away on the nearby ocean floor and the platforms move the \par
gold metallic cradle into that place under a rock overhang.\par
\tab To reduce the probability of being discovered, the spaceship changes its \par
outer surface to match the ocean floor around it.  After a complex set of \par
analyses of its entire decision matrix, the central computer concludes that the \par
maximum likelihood of success path for the overall mission involves trying to \par
enlist either the whales or the human beings to supply the extra lead and gold, \par
as well as the new information to be transmitted to the cradle.  So the \par
spacecraft implements those repairs that are straightforward, puts itself into a \par
standby for launch mode, and begins the task of communicating with the \par
Earthlings.\par
\tab The data taken by the Zoo explorers seven cycles ago (about a hundred \par
thousand Earth years) suggested that the whales and human beings, at that time, \par
had approximately the same potential for intelligence.  The whale language was \par
richer and more complicated at the time of this earlier investigation.  The Zoo \par
explorers studied it briefly and recorded in the archives its fundamental \par
tenets.  based upon that old data, while at the same time trying to develop a \par
scenario for communicating with the humans, the spaceship attempts to make \par
contact with the whales.  Because the whales have not substantially changed in \par
the intervening time, the attempts are partially successful; the whales \par
understand that they are being called, but they are mostly confused by the \par
messages and unable to figure out how to respond.\par
\tab Two small pods of whales do, however, decipher the message transmitted in \par
the ocean by the alien ship and swim toward its source.  The robots in the \par
extraterrestrial spacecraft examine the whales carefully, even showing the \par
captive missile to one of the pods to elicit recognition, and conclude \par
absolutely that the whales cannot be the spacefarers.  Therefore it is the human \par
beings who have made the great evolutionary strides and must be contacted and \par
somehow induced to provide the lead and the gold and the requisite information.  \par
Further attempts to communicate with the whales are abandoned.\par
\tab Before the alien ship has determined the method it will use to contact \par
humanity, chance provides it with an excellent opportunity.  During the final \par
interactions with the whales, three human beings are swimming in the \par
neighborhood.  By incredible luck, these three find the deployed cradle and take \par
it to the land.  As a cautionary move, the spaceship computer commands temporary \par
changes inside the cradle to ensure its protection and to provide for more \par
frequent status monitoring; however, there is no major concern yet.  The humans \par
do not recognize the connection between the cradle and the spacecraft.  In \par
addition, with the zygotes in their early stages of pullulation, the cradle has \par
an extremely robust design.  Having the cradle in the possession of humans at \par
this time can also be viewed as an advantage for the superaliens; receivers in \par
the cradle can be commanded to listen to the conversations and then telemeter to \par
the mother spacecraft information that will permit learning the rudiments of the \par
human language.\par
\tab The logical processes in the extraterrestrial computers are strained to \par
the limit to figure out a way to contact human beings for help without creating \par
undue risk for both the Earth cradle and the rest of the mission.  The computers \par
are about to decide on a rapid strike at mines for the lead and gold when they \par
realize, based on their partial understanding of the human language, that the \par
three humans who found the cradle may be coming back into the vicinity.  All of \par
the spaceship processors are strapped together to design a scenario that will \par
induce these humans to help them.  The inside of the spaceship is even \par
reconfigured from scratch for the arrival of the humans.  For if the scenario is \par
successful, there is a high probability that the spaceship can continue on its \par
mission, having successfully deposited the millions of repatriated zygotes, but \par
without having disrupted the main flow of life on Earth.  This was the original \par
goal of the mission.\par

\par
IT was after two o'clock in the morning by the time the Florida Queen left the \par
marina and headed out into the Gulf of Mexico.  Carol and Troy stood together \par
against the railing while Nick steered the boat through the harbor.  "Well, \par
angel," Troy said, "it has already been an unbelievable experience, hasn't it?  \par
And I must admit that I myself am a little nervous about what we're going to \par
find out at the dive site this time."\par
\tab "I thought you knew what was going to happen, Troy," Carol replied, \par
pointing at his bracelet.  "Don't they tell you everything?"\par
\tab "They tell me a lot.  And I'm getting better at understanding their \par
messages.  But how do I know if they're telling the truth?"\par
\tab "We have had the same problem with you at times," Nick interjected from \par
under the canopy.  The boat was almost out in the open ocean.  The lights from \par
Key West were receding behind them.  "In the final analysis, particularly when \par
nothing makes sense anyway, it comes down to a question of trust.  If I were to \par
ask myself logically why I am going out into the Gulf of Mexico in the middle of \par
the night to take lead and gold and information to some extraterrestrials who \par
stopped here on the Earth to make repairs \emdash  "\par
\tab Carol laughed and interrupted.  "But there's no logical way to discuss \par
this entire series of events.  Troy already pointed that out.  We're not \par
operating on logic.  And I don't even think it's a question of trust so much."  \par
She paused and looked up at the stars.  "It's more like faith."\par
\tab Troy put his arm around Carol and smiled.  "I agree with you, angel.  \par
After all, we don't know shit.  Only they know."\par
\tab Carol yawned.  There was silence on the boat.  Everyone was very tired.  \par
After the security men had surrounded Homer and Greta at the Miyako Gardens, the \par
police had of course been called.  They had arrived within ten minutes but it \par
had seemed as if their questions were going to last forever.  Carol, Nick, and \par
Troy had each been required to file a separate written statement.  Homer and \par
Greta admitted nothing, despite the fact that the security men had taken two \par
handguns from them and matching bullet fragments were found inside Troy's car.  \par
Homer had phoned his lawyer and was expecting to be out on bail within four to \par
six hours.\par
\tab When the trio did finally reach the marina (they had to walk from the \par
hotel because the police impounded Troy's car as evidence) carrying the \par
backpacks, Troy remembered that he had not yet connected the new navigation \par
equipment.  Maybe it was because Troy was tired or perhaps having his two \par
friends watch him part of the time over his shoulder made him nervous; whatever \par
the reason, Troy was very slow in installing and verifying the new navigation \par
processor.\par
\tab Meanwhile, Carol and Nick had been checking to ensure that there were \par
three complete sets of diving apparatus onboard the boat.  The diving gear the \par
men had used earlier in the evening was still out at the base in the possession \par
of the United States Navy.  Nick thought he recalled putting enough extra \par
equipment on the boat to handle the large party from Tampa that had originally \par
chartered the Florida Queen for the weekend.  He was correct, but one of the \par
regulator systems did not function properly during the checkout and had to be \par
exchanged for a spare.\par
\tab During the walk from the hotel to the marina, Nick and Carol and Troy had \par
come to the unanimous conclusion that they would all three keep the underwater \par
rendezvous with the superalien spaceship.  There was no other reasonable \par
solution.  The boat could certainly be safely anchored.  And none of the three \par
of them could bear to think of missing the climax to their adventure.\par
\tab Nick entered the ocean coordinates of the dive site into the navigation \par
processor and put the boat on autopilot.  He saw Carol yawn again.  It was \par
infectious.  As he opened his mouth for a long, relaxing yawn, Nick realized how \par
exhausted he was.  He walked around behind the canopy and found two light air \par
mattresses in a jumbled pile of supplies.  He started inflating one of them by \par
blowing into a valve at the end.\par
\tab Carol came around to the back of the boat when the first mattress was \par
almost inflated.  The light on top of the canopy gave her face a glow.  She's \par
even beautiful when she's tired, Nick thought.  He motioned to the other \par
mattress.  Carol bent down to pick it up and started inflating it.  And very \par
capable.  I've never met a woman who was so good at so many things.\par
\tab Nick finished with his air mattress and laid it down on the bottom of the \par
boat.  Carol was tiring, so he helped her inflate the rest of her mattress.  He \par
grabbed some towels and wadded them up like pillows.  "We all have to sleep \par
some," he said to her as an explanation.  "Otherwise we'll be punchy when we try \par
to dive."\par
\tab Carol nodded and walked back to the edge of the canopy.  "Is it all right \par
with you if Nick and I take a short nap?" she said to Troy.  He smiled his \par
assent.  "Wake one or both of us in an hour," she continued, "if you want to use \par
one of the air mattresses."  She turned around and started to leave.  "Uh, \par
Troy," she asked, before she left the side of the canopy.\par
\tab "Yes, angel?" he answered.\par
\tab "Do you know where they came from?"  She pointed at the sky.  Not too many \par
stars were visible because of the brightness of the gibbous moon.  It was well \par
past its zenith and already into its western descent.\par
\tab Troy looked up at the heavens and thought for almost a minute.  "No, \par
angel," he responded at length.  "I think they've tried to tell me, maybe even \par
twice, but I can't understand what they're saying.  But I do know that they come \par
from another star."\par
\tab Troy now walked over beside Carol and gave her a kiss on the cheek.  \par
"Sleep tight and don't let the bedbugs bite," he said.  "And maybe you can ask \par
them yourself after you wake up."\par
\tab Where do you come from?  Carol was thinking.  And why did you land here, \par
in this place, at this time?  She shaded her eyes from the glare of the moon and \par
concentrated her attention on Sirius, the brightest true star in the sky.  Do \par
you have a home there, around another star?  With mothers and fathers and \par
brothers?  Do you have love and oceans and mountains and music?  And longing and \par
loneliness and fear of death?  For reasons she could not understand, tears found \par
their way into Carol's eyes.  She dropped her gaze and walked back to the air \par
mattresses.  Nick was already stretched out on one of them.  He was on his back \par
and his eyes were closed.  Carol lay down on the mattress beside him.  She \par
reached out and put her hand in his.  He pulled her hand to his lips, kissed it \par
softly, and dropped it on his chest.\par
\par
\tab Nick's dream was confusing.  He was in the main lobby of a huge open \par
library with twenty floors of books.  He could see the spiral staircases \par
ascending to the stacks above him.  "But you don't understand," he said to the \par
clerk standing behind the long counter.  "I must read all these books this \par
weekend.  Otherwise I won't be ready for the test on Monday."\par
\tab "I'm sorry, sir," the diffident clerk replied quietly after scanning \par
Nick's list a second time.  "But all copies of these books are currently checked \par
out."\par
\tab Nick started to panic.  He looked up at the enormously high ceiling and \par
the floors of shelved books above him.  He saw Carol Dawson up on the third \par
floor, leaning against the railing and reading a book.  His panic subsided.  \par
She'll know the material, he thought to himself in the dream.  He raced over to \par
the staircase and bounded up the two flights of curving stairs.\par
\tab He was out of breath when he reached Carol.  She was reading one of the \par
books that had been on his list.  "Oh, good," he said between gasps, "I knew as \par
soon as I saw you that there was no worry."\par
\tab She looked at him quizzically.  Without warning she thrust her hand down \par
into the top of his jeans and grabbed his penis.  He responded immediately and \par
leaned forward to kiss her.  She shook her head and backed up.  He pursued her, \par
pushing her against the railing.  She fought him.  He pressed hard against her \par
body and succeeded in kissing her.  The railing gave way and they were falling, \par
falling.  He woke up before they hit the floor in the lobby of the library.\par
\tab Nick shuddered himself awake.  Carol was watching him intently.  Her head \par
was resting on her hands, propped up by her elbow.  "Are you all right?" she \par
asked as soon as he opened his eyes.\par
\tab It took Nick a few seconds to acclimate after the vivid dream.  His heart \par
was still racing out of control.  "I think so," he said.  Carol continued to \par
stare at him.  "Why are you looking at me like that?" he asked.\par
\tab "Well," she began, "I woke up because you were talking.  I even thought I \par
heard my name a couple of times.  Maybe I imagined it.  If you don't mind my \par
asking, do you often talk in your sleep?"\par
\tab "I don't know," Nick answered.  He laughed a little.  "Nobody has ever \par
mentioned it to me before."\par
\tab "Not even Monique?"  Carol said.  Her eyes did not leave Nick's.  She \par
could tell that he was trying to decide what kind of answer to give to her \par
question.  You're pushing again, a voice inside her said.  Let the man do things \par
at his own pace.\par
\tab Nick looked away.  "We did not sleep together that much," he said softly.  \par
There was a long pause.  "Besides," he said, now turning back to Carol, "that \par
was ten years ago.  I was very young.  And she was married to someone else."\par
\tab While they had been sleeping Troy had switched off the light on the top of \par
the canopy.  The only light on their faces now was the reflection from the moon.  \par
They continued to look at each other in silence.  Nick had not said very much to \par
Carol about Monique, but it had been more than he had ever told anyone else, \par
including his parents.  Carol knew how much of an effort it had been for him to \par
answer her question honestly.  She rolled over on her back again and extended \par
her hand to Nick.\par
\tab "So here we are, Mr. Williams.  Two solitary voyagers on the sea of life.  \par
Both of us are now past thirty.  Many of our friends and classmates have already \par
settled down into that house in the suburbs with the two kids and a dog.  Why \par
not us?  What's different about us?"\par
\tab The moon was accelerating its downward arc through the sky above them.  As \par
it descended, more stars could be seen on the opposite horizon.  Nick thought he \par
saw a shooting star.  There would be no way to hide from feelings.  Nick was \par
jumping ahead of the conversation, imagining for the moment that he was going to \par
be involved with Carol.  She would not permit it.  At least I would not have any \par
doubts about where we stood.\par
\tab "When I was over at her house on Friday morning," Nick finally replied to \par
her question, "Amanda Winchester told me that I'm looking for a fantasy woman, \par
someone absolutely perfect.  And that mere mortals always come up short in my \par
estimation."  He propped his head up and looked at Carol.  "But I think it's \par
something else.  I think maybe I'm not willing to make a commitment because of \par
fear of rejection."\par
\tab Did I really say that?  wondered Nick, shocked at himself.  Instantly he \par
felt as if he never should have shared the thought.  His defenses began to build \par
and he braced himself for a flippant or insensitive reply.\par
\tab But it did not come.  Instead Carol was quiet and thoughtful.  At length \par
she spoke.  "My protection is different from yours," she said.  "I always play \par
it safe.  I pick men I admire and respect, intellectual pals if you will, but \par
for whom I do not have any passion.  When I meet a man who sets off the banjos \par
and bells, I run the other way."\par
\tab Because I'm afraid, she thought.  Afraid that I might love him as much as \par
I did my father.  And I could not survive if I were abandoned like that again.\par
\tab She felt Nick's hand on her cheek.  He was caressing her gently.  She \par
reached up, took his hand, and squeezed it.  He pulled himself up on his side \par
where he could see her better.  She could tell that he wanted to kiss her.  She \par
squeezed his hand again.  Slowly, tentatively, he dropped his mouth on hers.  It \par
was a tender, adoring kiss, without pressure or overt passion, a subtle, artful \par
question that could have been either the beginning of a love affair or the sole \par
kiss exchanged between two people whose paths just happened to cross in life.  \par
Carol heard banjos and bells.\par

\par
WINTERS stood on the deck by himself, smoking quietly.  It was not a large boat, \par
this converted trawler, but it was very fast.  They had not left the dock until \par
after four o'clock and they had almost caught up with their prey already.  The \par
commander rubbed his eyes and yawned.  He was tired.  He blew smoke out over the \par
ocean.  On the eastern horizon there was just a faint suggestion of dawn.  To \par
the west, in the direction of the moon, Winters thought he saw the dim light of \par
another boat.\par
\tab These young people must all be crazy, he thought to himself as he \par
reflected back on the events of the evening.  Why the hell did they leave?  Did \par
they push Todd down those stairs without his knowing it?  It would have been so \par
much easier if they had just stayed there until we returned.\par
\tab He remembered the look on Lieutenant Ramirez' face when he had interrupted \par
the telephone conversation that Winters had been having with his wife, Betty.  \par
"Excuse me.  Commander," Ramirez had said.  He had been out of breath.  "You \par
must come quickly Lieutenant Todd is injured and our prisoners have escaped."\par
\tab He had told his wife that he had no idea when he would be home and then \par
joined Ramirez for the short walk back to the administration annex.  On the way \par
Winters had been thinking about Tiffani, about the difficulty he had had in \par
explaining to the seventeen-year-old why he could not just drop everything and \par
meet her at the party.  "But you can work any day or night, Vernon," she had \par
said.  "This is our only time to be together."  She had already drunk too much \par
champagne.  Later in the conversation, when Winters had made it clear to her \par
that he almost certainly would not make it to the party at all, and that he \par
would probably ask Melvin and Marc to take her home, Tiffani had become petulant \par
and angry.  She had stopped calling him Vernon.  "All right, Commander," she had \par
said, "I guess I'll see you at the theater on Tuesday night."\par
\tab The phone had clicked off and Winters had felt an ache tearing through his \par
heart.  Oh fuck, he had thought for a moment, I've blown it.  He had imagined \par
himself jumping in the car, forgetting Todd and Ramirez and the Panther missile, \par
and driving over to the party to sweep Tiffani into his arms.  But he had not \par
done it.  Despite his incredible longing, he was not able to pull himself away \par
from his duty.  If it was meant to be, he told himself consolingly, then those \par
flames of passion will burn again.  But even with his limited romantic \par
experience Winters knew better.  Timing is everything in a love affair.  If \par
momentum is lost at a critical moment, especially when the rhythm of the passion \par
is heading for a climax, it will never be regained.\par
\tab Ramirez had already called the doctor on the base and he had arrived at \par
the annex just after the two officers.  While they were standing there together, \par
Ramirez had insisted to Winters that it must have been foul play, that Todd \par
could not have fallen so hard unless he had either been pushed or thrown down \par
the concrete steps.  The lieutenant had begun to stir during the doctor's \par
examination.  "He has a bad concussion," the doctor had said after he first \par
checked Todd's eyes.  "He'll probably be all right but he'll have a ferocious \par
headache in the morning.  Meanwhile, we'll take him over to the infirmary and \par
sew up that gash in his head."\par
\tab To Winters it didn't make sense.  While he was waiting patiently in an \par
adjoining room for the doctors and nurses to finish the stitches in the \par
lieutenant's head, Winters tried to figure out what possible motive Nick and \par
Carol and Troy could have had for attacking Todd and then escaping.  The Dawson \par
woman is smart and successful.  Why would she do it?  He wondered if perhaps the \par
trio might have been involved in some kind of big drug transaction.  That would \par
at least explain all the gold.  But Todd and Ramirez did not find any indication \par
of drugs.  So what the hell is happening?\par
\tab Lieutenant Todd had been kept awake during the procedure in the emergency \par
room.  He had been given only a local anesthetic to reduce his pain.  But he had \par
not been very lucid in response to the doctor's simple questions.  "That \par
sometimes happens with a concussion," the medical officer had told Winters \par
afterward.  "He may not be very coherent for the next day or two."\par
\tab Nevertheless, around two o'clock, immediately after Todd's head had been \par
shaven, stitched, and bandaged, Commander Winters and Lieutenant Ramirez had \par
decided to ask him about what had occurred at the annex.  The commander could \par
not accept Todd's answer, even though the lieutenant repeated it twice verbatim.  \par
Todd had insisted that a six-foot carrot with vertical slits in its face had \par
hidden in the bathroom and had jumped him while he was trying to take a piss.  \par
He had escaped that first assault, but the giant carrot had then followed him \par
into the main room at the annex.\par
\tab "And just how did this thing \emdash  "\par
\tab "Carrot," interrupted Todd.\par
\tab "And how did this carrot attack you?" continued Winters.  Jesus, he had \par
thought, this man has cracked.  One bump on he head and he has finally flipped.\par
\tab "It's hard to describe exactly," Lieutenant Todd had answered slowly.  \par
"You see, it had four doodads hanging out of these vertical slits in its head.  \par
They were all mean looking \emdash  "\par
\tab The doctor had come up and interrupted.  "Gentlemen," he had said with a \par
perfect bedside smile, "my patient desperately needs rest.  Surely some of these \par
questions can wait until tomorrow."\par
\tab Commander Winters remembered an overpowering sense of bewilderment as he \par
watched the gurney take Lieutenant Todd from the emergency operating room to the \par
infirmary.  As soon as Todd was out of earshot, the commander had turned to \par
Lieutenant Ramirez.  "And what do you make of all this, Lieutenant?"\par
\tab "Commander, sir, I'm no medical expert .  .  ."\par
\tab "I know that, Lieutenant.  I don't want your medical opinion.  I want to \par
know what you think about the, uh, carrot business."  Damn him, Winters had \par
thought.  Does he have so little imagination that he can't even react to Todd's \par
story?\par
\tab "Sir," Ramirez had replied, "the carrot business is outside my \par
experience."\par
\tab To say the least.  Winters smiled to himself and flipped his cigarette \par
into the water.  He walked over to the little wheel-house and checked the \par
navigator.  They were only seven miles from the target boat and converging \par
rapidly.  He pulled back on the throttle and put the boat into neutral gear.  \par
Winters did not want to draw any closer to the Florida Queen until Ramirez and \par
the other two seamen were awake and in position.\par
\tab He estimated that it was still about forty minutes until sunrise.  Winters \par
laughed again about Ramirez's unwillingness to venture a comment on Todd's \par
carrot story.  But the young Latino is a good officer.  His only mistake was \par
following Todd.  Winters remembered how quickly Ramirez had organized all the \par
details of their current sortie, picking the high-tech converted trawler for \par
speed and stealth, rousting the two bachelor seamen who worked for him in \par
Intelligence, and establishing a special link between the base and the trawler \par
so that the whereabouts of the Florida Queen would be known at all times.\par
\tab "We must follow them.  We really have no choice," Lieutenant Ramirez had \par
said firmly to Winters after they had verified that Nick's boat had indeed left \par
the Hemingway Marina just after two o'clock.  "Otherwise there's no way we could \par
ever justify our having taken them into custody in the first place."\par
\tab Winters had reluctantly agreed and Ramirez had organized the chase.  The \par
commander had told the younger men to get some sleep while he formulated the \par
plan.  Which is simple.  Okay, you guys, come with us and answer the questions \par
or we'll charge you under the sedition act of 1991.  Now, after putting the boat \par
in idle, Winters was ready to wake Ramirez and the other two men.  He intended \par
to apprehend Nick, Carol, and Troy as soon as it was daylight.\par
\tab The wind around the boat changed direction and Winters stopped a minute to \par
check the weather.  He turned his face toward the moon.  The air suddenly felt \par
warmer, almost hot, and he was reminded of a night off the coast of Libya eight \par
years earlier.  The worst night of my life, he thought.  For a few moments his \par
resolve to carry out his plan wavered and he asked himself if he was about to \par
make another mistake.\par
\tab Then he heard a trumpet blast, followed maybe four seconds later by a \par
similar but quieter sound.  Winters looked around him in the placid ocean.  He \par
saw nothing.  Now he heard a group of trumpets and their echo, both sounds \par
distinctly coming from the west.  The commander strained his eyes in the \par
direction of the moon.  Silhouetted against its face he saw what appeared to be \par
a group of snakes dancing out of the water.  He went inside the wheelhouse to \par
fetch a pair of binoculars.\par
\tab By the time the commander returned to the railing a magnificent symphony \par
surrounded him.  Where is this incredible music coming from? he asked at first, \par
before he succumbed completely to its mesmerizing beauty.  He stood powerless \par
against the railing, listening intently.  The music was rich, emotional, full of \par
evocative longing.  Winters was swept away.  not only into his own past where \par
his deepest memories were stored, but also onto another planet in another era \par
where proud and dignified serpents with blue necks called to their loved ones \par
during their short annual mating rite.\par
\tab He was spellbound.  Tears were already flooding into his eyes when he at \par
last mechanically lifted the binoculars and focused on the strange, sinuous \par
shapes underneath the moon.  The ghostlike images were completely transparent; \par
the moonlight went right through them.  As Winters watched what was a thousand \par
necks dancing above the water, cavorting back and forth in perfect rhythm, and \par
as he heard the music build toward the concluding crescendo of the Canthorean \par
mating symphony, his tired eyes blurred and he swore that what he saw across the \par
water in front of him, calling to him with a song of longing and desire, was an \par
image of Tiffani Thomas.  His heart was devastated by the combination of the \par
music and the sight of her.  Winters was aware of an intense sense of loss \par
unparalleled in his life.\par
\tab Yes, he said to himself as Tiffani continued to beckon in the distance, \par
I'm coming.  I'm sorry Tiffani darling.  Tomorrow I will come to see you.  We \par
will .  .  .  He stopped his interior monologue to wipe his eyes.  The music had \par
now entered the final crescendo.  signaling the actual mating dance of the pairs \par
of Canthorean serpents.  Winters looked through his binoculars again.  The image \par
of Tiffani was gone.  He adjusted his glasses.  Joanna Carr came into focus, \par
smiled briefly, and disappeared.  A moment later the little Arab girl from the \par
Virginia beach seemed to dance just under the moon.  She was happy and gay.  She \par
too was gone in an instant.\par
\tab The music was all around him.  Bursts of sound, powerful, full, expressing \par
pleasure no longer anticipated but now being experienced.  He looked through his \par
binoculars one more time.  The moon was setting.  As it fell into the ocean the \par
image created against its illuminated disc by the dancing serpents was \par
unmistakable.  Winters clearly saw the faces of his wife, Betty, and his son, \par
Hap.  They were smiling at him together with a deep and abiding affection.  They \par
remained there in his vision until the moon sank completely into the ocean.\par

\par
CAROL struggled to adjust her diving equipment.  "Do you need some help, angel?"  \par
Troy asked.  He came over and stood beside her in the predawn dark.  He was \par
already fully prepared for the dive.\par
\tab "I haven't worn anything like this since my first set of scuba lessons," \par
she said, fidgeting uncomfortably with the old-fashioned gear.\par
\tab Troy tightened the weight belt around her waist.  "You're scared, aren't \par
you, angel?"  Carol didn't answer right away.  "Me too.  My pulse rate must be \par
twice normal."\par
\tab Carol's equipment seemed to please her finally.  "You know, Troy, even \par
after the last three days my brain is having a hard time convincing the rest of \par
me that all this is really happening.  Imagine writing it down for someone to \par
read.  "As we were preparing to return to the alien spaceship .  .  .' "\par
\tab "Hey, you guys, come here," Nick called from the other side of the canopy.  \par
Carol and Troy walked around to the front of the boat.  Nick was staring out \par
across the ocean to the east.  He handed a small pair of binoculars to Carol.  \par
"Do you see a light out there in the distance, just to the left of that island?"\par
\tab Carol could barely make out the light.  "Uh huh," she said to Nick.  "But \par
so what?  Isn't it reasonable that somewhere out in the ocean there would be \par
another boat?"\par
\tab "Of course," Nick answered.  "But that light hasn't moved for fifteen \par
minutes.  It's just sitting there.  Why would a fishing boat, or any other kind \par
of boat, be \emdash  "\par
\tab "Sh," interrupted Troy.  He put his fingers to his lips.  "Listen," he \par
whispered, "I hear music."\par
\tab His companions stood quietly on the deck.  Behind them the moon \par
disappeared into the ocean.  Above the gentle lapping of the waves all three of \par
them could hear what sounded like the climax of a symphony, played by a full \par
orchestra.  They listened for thirty seconds.  The music reached a peak, faded \par
slightly, and then ceased abruptly.\par
\tab "That was beautiful," Carol remarked.\par
\tab "And weird," Nick said, walking over beside her.  "Where the hell was it \par
coming from?  Is someone out there testing a new stereo system?  My God, if the \par
sound travels five or ten miles, it must be deafening up close."\par
\tab Troy was standing off to the side by himself.  He was concentrating on \par
something.  Suddenly he turned to his companions.  "I know this sounds crazy," \par
he said to Nick and Carol, "but I think the music was a signal for us to dive.  \par
Or perhaps a warning."\par
\tab "Great," said Carol.  "That's what we need to reassure us.  A warning of \par
some kind.  As if we're not nervous enough."\par
\tab Nick put his arm around her.  "Hey, lady," he said, "don't wimp out on us \par
now.  After all those brave comments about a once in a lifetime experience .  .  \par
."\par
\tab "Really, let's go," Troy said impatiently.  He looked anxious and very \par
serious.  "I'm definitely getting the message that we should dive now."\par
\tab Troy's solemnity changed the mood of the trio.  The three of them worked \par
together in silence to secure the two buoyancy bags containing the lead, the \par
gold, and the information discs.  The eastern sky continued to brighten.  It was \par
only about fifteen minutes until sunrise.\par
\tab While they were working, Carol noticed that Nick seemed a little \par
distracted.  Right before they left the boat she walked up beside him.  "Are you \par
all right?" she said quietly.\par
\tab "Yes," he answered.  "I'm just trying to figure out if I've completely \par
lost my mind.  For eight years I have been thinking about what I would do if I \par
ever had my full share of the treasure.  Now I'm about to give it all away to \par
some extra-terrestrials from God knows where."  He looked at her.  "There's \par
enough gold here to last three people a long time."\par
\tab "I know," she said, giving him a little hug.  "I must admit that I've \par
thought about it too.  But in reality, part belongs to Amanda Winchester, part \par
to Jake Lewis, most of it to the IRS .  .  ."  She grinned.  "And it's only \par
money.  That's nothing when you compare it to being the only humans to interact \par
with visitors from another planet."\par
\tab "I hope you're right," he said.  "I hope I don't wake up tomorrow and feel \par
as if I've made a terrible mistake.  This entire episode has been so bizarre \par
that I suspect my normal faculties aren't working properly.  We don't even know \par
for sure if these aliens are friendly .  .  ."\par
\tab Carol pulled her diving mask over her face.  "We'll never have all the \par
answers," she said.  She took his hand.  "Let's go, Nick."\par
\tab Troy was first into the water.  Nick and Carol followed.  It had been \par
agreed before the dive that Carol would take the searchlight and lead the group.  \par
She was the most mobile of the threesome because each of the men was dragging a \par
buoyancy bag.  The trio had been concerned that they might have difficulty \par
finding the ship and had discussed an elaborate set of contingency plans for \par
locating it.  They needn't have worried.  Thirty feet under the Florida Queen, \par
in virtually the exact place where the fissure had been on Thursday, there was a \par
light in the water.  Carol pointed at it and the two men swam up behind her.  As \par
they drew closer, they saw that the light was coming from a rectangular area \par
about ten feet high and twenty feet wide.  They could not see anything except \par
what looked like some kind of material or fabric with a soft light behind it.\par
\tab Carol hesitated.  Troy swam right on by her, into the lighted area, his \par
buoyancy bag trailing behind him.  Everything disappeared.  Nick and Carol \par
waited.  Carol felt herself tightening up.  Come on now, Dawson, she thought, \par
it's your turn.  You've been here before.  She took a deep breath and swam into \par
the material.  She felt something like plastic touch her face and then she was \par
in a covered tunnel.  A swift current was pulling her to the right.  She went \par
down a small water slide and was deposited in a shallow pool at the bottom.  She \par
clambered out of the pool and began removing her diving equipment.\par
\tab Troy was standing on the floor about ten feet beyond the end of the pool.  \par
Next to him a warden had already taken the buoyancy bag, opened it, and adroitly \par
separated the gold bars and the lead weights from the information discs.  As \par
Carol's eyes adjusted to the dim light around her, she saw that the warden was \par
now loading the gold on a small platform sitting on top of tank treads about a \par
foot above the floor.  Immediately thereafter, the warden placed the information \par
discs and the lead weights on two other platforms.  A carpet that had been lying \par
inconspicuously over against the wall on the left then rose up, apparently \par
activated the treads under the platforms, and directed them toward a nearby \par
hallway leading out of the room.\par
\tab Carol pulled off her mask and finished removing her diving gear.  She was \par
in a medium-sized room somewhat like the ones she and Troy had encountered at \par
the beginning of her last dive.  The curved wall partitions were colored black \par
and white.  There was a small window to the ocean next to the splash pool on her \par
left.  The ceilings were low and tight, only a couple of feet above her head, \par
giving her a feeling of claustrophobia.  So here I am again, she thought, Back \par
in Wonderland.  This time I will take plenty of pictures.  She photographed the \par
procession of the carpet and three platforms just as it disappeared from the \par
room.  She then changed lenses and took a dozen quick close-up pictures of the \par
warden standing next to Troy.  It had the same amoebalike central body as the \par
one she had confronted the day before, but there were only five implements \par
sticking out of its upper half.  The warden had probably been customized for its \par
particular job of taking the objects from the trio.\par
\tab Troy walked over beside her.  "Where's Nick?" he asked.  My God, Carol \par
thought as she turned around and looked back at the slide and splash pool.  I \par
almost forgot.  She chastised herself for not having waited for Nick.  After \par
all, he's never been down here .  .  .\par
\tab Nick's big body careened out of control against the sides of the slide and \par
he hurtled into the splash pool.  The heavy buoyancy bag came down behind him \par
and hit him hard, just above the kidneys.  He stumbled to his feet, fell down in \par
the pool, and then stood up again.  In his diving apparatus with the thin \par
plastic material from the bag tied around his wrist, it was he who looked like \par
the visitor from outer space.\par
\tab Carol and Troy were laughing as Nick climbed out of the splash pool.  "All \par
right.  Professor!"  exclaimed Troy.  He reached forward to give him a hand.  \par
"Good show.  It's a shame we don't have that entry on tape."\par
\tab Nick removed his mouthpiece.  He was out of breath.  "Thanks a lot for \par
waiting, team," he stammered.  He looked around him.  "What is this place, \par
anyway?"\par
\tab The warden meanwhile had approached him from the side and was already \par
tugging at the bag with one of its appendages.  "Just a minute, weirdo," Nick \par
said, suppressing his fright.  "Let me get my bearings first."\par
\tab The warden didn't stop.  A knifelike appendage cut the bag below where it \par
was attached to Nick's wrist.  Next the warden took the entire bag, including \par
its lead and gold contents, and somehow pushed it through its own semipermeable \par
outer skin.  The bag could be seen intact, adjacent to the rectangular control \par
boxes, as the warden turned and hurried across the floor.  It went through the \par
same exit that the carpet and platforms had used earlier.\par
\tab "You're welcome," Nick managed to say as he watched the strange creature \par
disappear with the loot.  He finished taking off his diving gear and walked over \par
to Troy.  "Okay, Jefferson, you're the main man here.  What do we do now?"\par
\tab "Well, Professor," he answered, "as far as I can tell, our job is \par
finished.  If you guys want, we can suit up again and jump through that window \par
wall over there.  We'd be back in the boat in less than five minutes.  If I've \par
read the messages right, these alien dudes will be ready to leave very shortly."\par
\tab "You mean that's it?  We're done?"  Carol asked.  Troy nodded.  "This is \par
the most overrated experience since my first sexual encounter," Carol commented.\par
\tab Nick was walking across the room, moving directly away from the splash \par
pool and his two friends.  "Where are you going?"  Troy asked.\par
\tab "I paid a hefty admission price," Nick replied.  "I'm at least entitled to \par
a tour."  Carol and Troy followed him.  They crossed the empty room and walked \par
through an exit between two wall partitions on the opposite side.  They entered \par
a short, dark, covered corridor.  They could see light at the other end.  They \par
emerged into another room, this one circular and significantly larger.  It had \par
the high cathedral ceilings that Carol had liked so much on her last visit.\par
\tab This room was not empty.  Sitting in its middle facing them was a \par
gigantic, enclosed, translucent cylinder, about twenty-five feet high altogether \par
and ten feet in diameter at its base.  A horde of orange pipes and purple cable \par
sheaths attached the cylinder to a group of machines built into the wall behind \par
it.  There was a light green liquid filling the inside of the cylinder and eight \par
gold metallic objects floating at different heights in the liquid.  The objects \par
were many different shapes.  One looked like a starfish, another like a box, a \par
third like a derby hat; the only thing the objects had in common was their gold \par
metallic outer covering.  Upon close inspection of the cylinder, thin membranes \par
could be seen inside the liquid.  These surfaces effectively partitioned the \par
internal volume and gave each of the golden objects its own unique subvolume.\par
\tab "All right, genius," Nick said to Troy, after he stared at the cylinder \par
for almost a full minute.  "Explain what this is all about."  Carol was in a \par
photographer's paradise.  She had nearly finished recording all hundred and \par
twenty-eight pictures that could be stored on one minidisc.  She had \par
photographed the cylinder from all angles, including a close-up of each of the \par
objects suspended in the liquid, and was now working on the machines behind it.  \par
She stopped taking pictures to listen to Troy's reply.\par
\tab "Well, Professor .  .  ."  Troy started.  His forehead was knitted as he \par
tried to concentrate.  "As far as I can make out from what they've been trying \par
to tell me, this spaceship is on a mission to a dozen planets that are scattered \par
in this part of the galaxy.  On each planet the aliens leave one of those golden \par
things you see in the cylinder.  They contain tiny embryos or seeds that have \par
been genetically engineered for survival on that specific planet."\par
\tab Carol walked over beside them.  "So the ship goes from planet to planet, \par
dropping off these packages containing seeds of some kind?  Sort of a galactic \par
Johnny Appleseed?"\par
\tab "Sort of, angel, except that there are both animal and plant seeds inside \par
the container.  Plus advanced robots that nurture and educate the growing things \par
until they reach maturity.  Then the creatures can flourish on their own without \par
help."\par
\tab "All in that one little package?"  Nick asked.  He looked again at the \par
fascinating objects floating in the liquid in the cylinder.  He loved the golden \par
color.  All of a sudden he thought of the trident.  He imagined thousands of \par
tiny swarming embryos inside its outer golden surface and in his mind's eye he \par
projected the growth of the swarm into the future.  There was something fearsome \par
about creatures genetically engineered to survive on the planet Earth.  What if \par
they are not friendly?\par
\tab Nick's heart sped up as he realized what had been bothering him, partly \par
subconsciously, since he started believing Troy's story about the aliens.  Why \par
did they stop on the Earth in the first place?  What do they really want from \par
us?  His mind raced on.  And if that trident contains beings destined for Earth \par
that are extremely advanced, he thought, then it doesn't matter if they are \par
friendly.  We will be finished sooner or later anyway.\par
\tab Carol and Troy were talking in general terms about the way an advanced \par
civilization might use seeds to colonize other planets.  Nick wasn't listening \par
carefully.  I can't tell Troy or even Carol.  If the aliens know what I'm \par
thinking they will stop me.  I'd better do it soon.\par
\tab "Troy," he heard Carol say as she began to take another set of pictures of \par
the objects in the cylinder, "is it just co-incidence that the trident we found \par
on Thursday looks so much like one of these seed packages?"\par
\tab Nick did not wait for Troy to answer.  "Excuse me," he interrupted in a \par
loud voice.  "I forgot something very important.  I must go back to the boat.  \par
Stay here and wait for me.  I'll be right back."\par
\tab He burst out of the room, down the corridor, and across the room with the \par
low ceiling and the window on the ocean.  Good, he said to himself, nothing is \par
going to stop me.  Without even pausing to put on his diving gear, Nick took a \par
huge breath and dove through the window.  He was afraid that his lungs were \par
going to explode before he reached the surface.  But he made it.  He climbed up \par
the ladder and onto the boat.\par
\par
\tab Nick went immediately to the bottom drawer underneath the racks of \par
electronic equipment.  He reached in and grabbed the golden trident.  He could \par
feel that the axis rod had thickened considerably.  It was now nearly twice as \par
thick as it had been the first time that he held it.  Carol was right.  Damnit, \par
why didn't I listen to her at the time?  He pulled the object completely out of \par
the drawer.  The sun was just about to come up behind him.  In the dawn light \par
Nick could see that the trident had changed in several other ways.  It was \par
heavier.  The individual tines on the fork end were much thicker and had almost \par
grown together.  In addition, there was an open hole into a soft, gooey interior \par
on the north pole of the larger of the two spheres.\par
\tab Nick examined it carefully.  Suddenly he felt powerful arms wrap \par
themselves around his chest and upper body, forcing him to drop the trident on \par
the floor of the boat.  "Now just hold steady," he heard a lightly accented \par
voice say, "and turn around slowly.  We won't hurt you if you cooperate."\par
\tab Nick turned around.  Commander Winters and a tall, fat seaman that Nick \par
had never seen before were standing in front of him in wetsuits.  Lieutenant \par
Ramirez was still holding him from behind.  Ramirez gradually released Nick and \par
bent down to pick up the trident.  He handed it to Winters.  "Thank you, \par
Lieutenant," Winters said.  "Where are your companions, Williams?" he then asked \par
Nick.  "Down there with my missile?"\par
\tab Nick didn't say anything at first.  Too much was happening too fast.  He \par
was having difficulty integrating Winters into his scenario for returning the \par
trident to the spaceship.  As soon as Nick had felt the changes in its outer \par
surface, he had known for certain that the trident was one of the seed packages.\par
\tab Winters was studying the trident.  "And what's the significance of this \par
thing?" he said.  "You guys have taken enough photographs of it."\par
\tab Nick was doing some calculations.  If I am delayed here very long, then \par
Carol and Troy will undoubtedly leave the ship.  And the aliens will launch.  He \par
took a deep breath.  My only chance is the truth.\par
\tab "Commander Winters," Nick began, "please listen very carefully to what I'm \par
about to say.  It will sound fantastic, even preposterous, but it's all true.  \par
And if you will come with me, I can prove everything to you.  The fate of the \par
human race may well depend on what we do in the next five minutes."  He paused \par
to organize his ideas.\par
\tab For some reason Winters thought about the ridiculous carrot story that \par
Todd had told him.  But the earnestness he was seeing in Nick's face persuaded \par
him to continue to pay attention.  "Go ahead, Williams," he said.\par
\tab "Carol Dawson and Troy Jefferson are right now onboard a super-advanced \par
extraterrestrial spaceship that is directly under this boat.  The alien vehicle \par
is traveling from planet to planet depositing packages of embryonic beings that \par
are genetically designed to survive on a particular planet.  That golden thing \par
in your hand is, in a sense, a cradle for creatures that may later flourish on \par
the Earth.  I must return it to the aliens before they leave or our descendants \par
may not survive."\par
\tab Commander Winters looked at Nick as if he had lost his mind.  The \par
commander started to say something.  "No," Nick interrupted.  "Hear me out.  The \par
spacecraft also stopped here because it needed some repairs.  At one time we \par
thought it might have found your missile.  That's partially how we got involved \par
in the first place.  We didn't know about the creatures in the cradle.  So we \par
were trying to help.  One of the things the aliens needed for their repairs was \par
gold.  You see, they only had three days \emdash  "\par
\tab "Jesus K.  Christ!"  Winters shouted at Nick.  "Do you really expect me to \par
believe this crap?  This is the looniest, most farfetched story I have ever \par
heard in my entire life.  You're nuts.  Cradles, aliens who need gold for \par
repairs .  .  .  I suppose next you'll be telling me that they are six feet tall \par
and look like carrots \emdash  " \tab "And have four vertical slits in their faces?"  \par
Nick added.\par
\tab Winters glanced around.  "You told him?" he said to Lieutenant Ramirez.  \par
Ramirez shook his head back and forth.\par
\tab "No," Nick continued abruptly as the commander looked completely confused.  \par
"The carrot thing wasn't an alien, at least not one of the superaliens who made \par
the ship.  The carrot was a holographic projection .  .  ."\par
\tab The perplexed Commander Winters waved his hands.  " I'm not listening to \par
any more of this nonsense, Williams.  At least not here.  What I want to know is \par
what you and your friends know about the location of the missile.  Now will you \par
come with us over to our boat of your own free will, or do we have to tie you \par
up?"\par
\tab At that moment, six feet above them, a ten-legged, black, spiderlike \par
creature with a body about four inches in diameter walked unnoticed to the edge \par
of the canopy.  It extended three antennae in their direction and then leaped \par
off the side, landing on the back of Lieutenant Ramirez' neck.  "Aieee," \par
screamed the lieutenant during the pause in the conversation.  He fell down on \par
his knees behind Nick and grasped at the black thing that was trying to take a \par
sample chunk out of his neck.  For a second nobody moved.  Then Nick grabbed a \par
large pair of pliers from the counter and thwacked the black thing once, twice, \par
and even a third time before it released its grip on Ramirez' neck.\par
\tab All four men watched it fall to the deck, scuttle rapidly over to the \par
cradle that Commander Winters had put down so that he could assist Ramirez, \par
shrink its size by a factor of ten, and disappear into the cradle through the \par
soft gooey opening on the top of the sphere.  Within seconds the goo hardened \par
and all the external surfaces of the cradle were again rigid.\par
\tab Winters was flabbergasted.  Ramirez crossed himself.  The seaman looked as \par
if he were about to faint.  "I swear to you that my story is true, Commander," \par
Nick said calmly.  "All you have to do is come down with me and see for \par
yourself.  I left my diving gear down there so that I could hurry up here to \par
retrieve this thing.  We can go together with my last working tank and share the \par
air supply."\par
\tab Winters' head was spinning.  The ten-legged spider was the straw that \par
broke the camel's back.  He felt that he had now entered the Twilight Zone.  I \par
have never seen or heard anything even remotely like this before in my life, \par
Winters thought.  And only half an hour ago I had wild hallucinations with \par
musical accompaniment.  Maybe I am the one losing touch with reality.  \par
Lieutenant Ramirez was still on his knees.  It looked as if he were praying.  Or \par
maybe this is finally my sign from God.\par
\tab "All right, Williams," the commander was surprised to hear himself say.  \par
"I'll go with you.  But my men will wait here on your boat for our return."\par
\tab Nick picked up the trident and raced around the canopy to prepare the \par
diving equipment.\par
\par
\tab It took Carol and Troy a few seconds to react to Nick's abrupt departure.  \par
"That was strange," Carol said finally.  "What do you suppose he forgot?"\par
\tab "I have no idea," Troy shrugged.  "But I hope he hurries back.  I don't \par
think it's very long until launch.  And I'm sure they will throw us out before \par
then."\par
\tab Carol thought for a moment and then turned back to look at the cylinder.  \par
"You know, Troy, those golden things are exactly like the trident on the \par
outside.  Did you say \emdash  "\par
\tab "I didn't answer you before, angel," Troy interrupted.  "But yes, you're \par
right.  It is the same material.  I hadn't realized until we came down here \par
today that what we picked up on that first dive was the seed package for Earth.  \par
They may have tried to tell me before; maybe I just didn't understand them."\par
\tab Carol was fascinated.  She walked over and put her face against the \par
cylinder wall.  It felt more like glass than plastic.  "So maybe I was right \par
when I thought it was heavier and thicker .  .  ."  she said, as much to herself \par
as to Troy.  "And inside that trident are seeds for better plants and animals?"  \par
Troy nodded his head in response.\par
\tab There was now some motion inside the cylinder.  The thin membranes \par
separating the subvolumes were growing what appeared to be guidewires that were \par
wrapping themselves around the individual golden objects.  Carol reloaded her \par
camera with a new disc and ran around the outside of the cylinder, stopping in \par
the best positions to photograph the process.  Troy looked down at his bracelet.  \par
"There's no doubt about it, angel.  These ETs are definitely preparing to \par
launch.  Maybe we should go."\par
\tab 'We'll wait as long as we can," Carol shouted from across the room.  \par
"These photographs will he priceless."  They both could now hear weird noises \par
behind the walls.  The noises were not loud, but they were distracting because \par
they were erratic and so totally alien.  Troy paced nervously as he listened to \par
the gamut of sounds.  Carol walked over beside him.  "Besides," she said, "Nick \par
asked us to wait for him."\par
\tab "That's great," Troy answered, "as long as they wait as well."  He seemed \par
uncharacteristically nervous.  "I don't want to be onboard when these guys leave \par
the Earth."\par
\tab "Hey there, Mr. Jefferson," Carol said, you are supposed to he the calm \par
one.  Relax.  You just said yourself that you think they'll throw us out before \par
they leave."  She paused and looked searchingly at Troy.  "What do you know that \par
I don't?"\par
\tab Troy turned away from her and started walking toward the exit.  Carol ran \par
after him and grabbed his arm.  "What is it, Troy?" she said.  'What's wrong?"\par
\tab "Look, angel," he replied, not looking directly at her, "I just figured it \par
out myself a minute ago.  And I'm still not sure what it means.  I hope I \par
haven't made a terrible \emdash  "\par
\tab "What are you talking about?" she interrupted him.  "You're not making any \par
sense."\par
\tab "The Earth package," he blurted out.  "It has human seeds in it too.  \par
Along with the trees and insects and grasses and birds."\par
\tab Carol stood facing Troy, trying to understand what was bothering him so \par
much.  "When they came here a long long time ago," he said, his face wrinkled \par
with concern, "they took specimens of the different species and returned them to \par
their home world.  Where they were improved by genetic engineering and prepared \par
for their eventual return to the Earth.  Some of those specimens were human \par
beings."\par
\tab Carol's heart quickened as she realized what Troy was telling her.  So \par
that's it, she said to herself.  There are superhumans inside that package we've \par
found.  Not just better flowers and better bugs, but better people as well.  But \par
unlike Troy, Carol's immediate reaction was not fear.  She was overwhelmed by \par
curiosity.\par
\tab "Can I see them?" she asked excitedly.  Troy didn't understand.  "The \par
superhumans, or whatever you want to call them .  .  .  ," she continued, "can I \par
see them?"\par
\tab Troy shook his head.  "They're just tiny zygotes, angel.  More than a \par
billion would fit in your hand.  You wouldn't be able to see anything."\par
\tab Carol was not dissuaded.  " But these guys have such amazing technological \par
ability.  Maybe they can .  .  ."  She stopped.  "Wait a minute, Troy.  Remember \par
that carrot on the base?  It was a holographic projection and must have come \par
somehow out of the information base on this spacecraft."\par
\tab Carol walked away from Troy into the middle of the room.  She raised her \par
arms and looked up at the ceiling thirty feet above her.  "Okay, you guys, \par
whoever you are," she invoked in a loud voice.  "Now there's something that I \par
want.  We risked our ass to get what you needed for your repairs.  You can at \par
least reciprocate.  I want to see what we might look like someday .  .  ."\par
\tab To their left, not too far from one of the large blocky machines connected \par
to the cylinder, two of the wall partitions moved apart to form a hallway.  They \par
could see light at the other end.  "Come on," an exultant Carol called to Troy, \par
who was again smiling and admiring her assertiveness, "let's go see what our \par
superaliens have created for us now."\par
\tab At the end of the short corridor, there was a softly lit square room about \par
twenty feet on a side.  Against the opposite wall, illuminated by a blue light \par
that gave the entire tableau a surrealistic appearance, eight children were \par
standing around a large, glowing model of the Earth.  As Carol and Troy \par
approached, they recognized that what they were seeing was not real, that it was \par
simply a complex sequence of images projected into the air in front of them.  \par
But the diaphanous picture contained such rich detail that it was easy to forget \par
it was just a projection.\par
\tab The children were four or five years old.  All were wearing only a thin \par
white loincloth that covered their genitals.  There were four girls and four \par
boys.  Two of them were black, two were Caucasian with blue eyes and blonde \par
hair, two were Oriental, and the final boy and girl, definitely twins, looked \par
like a mixture of all humanity What Carol immediately noticed was their eyes.  \par
All eight children had large, piercing eyes of brilliant intensity that were \par
focused on the glowing Earth in front of them.\par
\tab "The continents of this planet," the little black boy was saying, "were \par
once tied together in a single gigantic land mass that stretched from pole to \par
pole.  This was relatively recently, only about two hundred million years ago.  \par
Since that time the motion of the plates on which the individual land masses \par
rest has completely changed the configuration of the surface.  Here, for \par
example, you can see the Indian sub continent tearing away from Antarctica a \par
hundred million years ago and moving across the ocean toward an eventual \par
collision with Asia.  It was this collision and the subsequent plate interaction \par
that lifted the Himalayas, the highest mountains on the planet, to their current \par
height."\par
\tab As the little boy was talking, the electronic model Earth in front of him \par
demonstrated the continental changes that he was describing.  "But what is the \par
mechanism that causes these plates and land masses to move with respect to each \par
other?" the tiny blonde-haired girl asked.\par
\tab "Psst," Carol whispered in Troy's ear.  "How come they are speaking \par
English and know all this Earth geography?"  Troy looked at her as if he were \par
disappointed and made a circular motion with his hands.  Of course, Carol said \par
to herself, they've already processed the discs.\par
\tab ".  .  .  then this activity results in material being thrust upward from \par
the mantle below the Earth's crust.  Eventually the continents are pushed apart.  \par
Any other questions?"  The black boy was smiling.  He pointed at the model in \par
front of him.  "Here's what will happen to the land masses in the next fifty \par
million years or so.  The Americas will continue to move to the West, away from \par
Africa and Europe, making the South Atlantic a much larger ocean.  The Persian \par
Gulf will close altogether, Australia will drive north toward the equator and \par
press against Asia, and both Baja California and the area around Los Angeles \par
will split off from North America to drift northward in the Pacific Ocean.  By \par
fifty million years from now Los Angeles will start sliding into the Aleutian \par
Islands."\par
\tab All of the children watched the changing globe with complete attention.  \par
When the continents on the surface of the model stopped moving, the Oriental boy \par
stepped slightly out from the group.  "We have seen this continental drift \par
phenomenon that Brian has been describing on half a dozen other planets, all of \par
them bodies mostly covered by a liquid.  Tomorrow Sherry will lead a more \par
detailed discussion about the forces inside a planet that cause the sea floor to \par
spread in the first place."\par
\tab A projected image of a warden entered the scene from the left and removed \par
both the Earth globe and several other unidentified props.  The small boy waited \par
patiently for the warden to complete his task and then continued, "Darla and \par
David now want to share with us a project they have been working on for several \par
days.  They will play the music while Miranda and Justin perform the dance they \par
choreographed."\par
\tab The mixed twins turned eagerly to their classmates.  The girl spoke out.  \par
"When we first learned about adult love and the changes that we all can expect \par
after we pass puberty, David and I tried to envision what it would be like to \par
find a new desire even stronger than those we already know.  Our joint vision \par
became a short musical composition and a dance.  We call it 'The Dance of Love.' \par
"\par
\tab The two children sat down away from the group, almost at the side of the \par
image, and began moving their fingers rapidly as if they were typing on the \par
floor.  A light synthesized melody, pleasant and spirited, filled the room.  The \par
blond boy and the Oriental girl began to dance in the center of the group.  At \par
first in the dance, the two were totally separate, unaware of each other, each \par
child completely absorbed in his own activities.  The boy knelt down to pick a \par
beautiful flower, its red and white coloring shimmering in the holographic \par
projection.  The girl bounced a large bright blue ball as she danced.  After a \par
while the little girl noticed the boy and approached him, somewhat tentatively, \par
offering to share the ball.  The boy played ball with her but ignored everything \par
except the game.\par
\tab This is magic, thought Carol as she watched the children's images moving \par
with grace and deft precision in front of her.  These children are wonderful.  \par
But they can't be real.  They are too orderly, too self-contained.  Where is the \par
tension, the strife?  But despite her questions she was profoundly moved by the \par
scene she was witnessing.  The children were acting in concert, as a group, \par
flowing in harmony from activity to activity.  Their body language was open and \par
unafraid.  No neuroses were blocking their learning process.\par
\tab The dance continued.  The music deepened as the boy began to pay attention \par
to his partner and she began arranging her hair with his favorite flowers for \par
their brief encounters.  The body movements changed as well, the sprightly, \par
exuberant bounces of the initial stages giving way to subtly suggestive motions \par
designed to awaken and then tease the budding libido.  The tiny dancers touched, \par
moved away, and came back together in an embrace.\par
\tab Carol was entranced.  How would my life have been different, she wondered, \par
if I had known all this at the age of five?  She remembered her rich friend at \par
soccer camp, Jessica from Laguna Beach, whom she had seen occasionally in \par
subsequent years.  Jessica was always ahead, always had to be first.  She had \par
had sex with boys before I even started my period.  And look what happened to \par
her.  Three marriages, three divorces, just thirty years old.\par
\tab Carol tried to stop her mind from drifting so that she could pay complete \par
attention to the dance.  Suddenly she remembered her camera.  She had just taken \par
her first pictures of the children when she heard a noise behind her.  Nick was \par
coming toward them through the corridor.  And he was carrying the trident in his \par
hand.\par
\tab Nick started to say something but Troy hushed him by putting his finger \par
against his own lips and pointing at the dance in progress.  The tempo had now \par
changed.  The two mixed children had somehow put the music on automatic (it \par
seemed to be repeating some of the early verses, but with additional instruments \par
in a more complex pattern) and joined the blond boy and the Oriental girl in the \par
dance.  Carol's first impression before Nick spoke out loud was that the dance \par
was now exploring friendships between the paired couple and other people.\par
\tab "What's this all about?"  Nick said.  The moment he spoke the entire \par
projected tableau vanished.  All of the children, the dance, and the music \par
disappeared in an instant.  Carol was surprised to find that she was \par
disappointed and even a little angry.  "Now you've blown it," she said.\par
\tab Nick looked at his companions' stern faces.  "Jesus," he said, holding up \par
the cradle, "such a greeting.  I bust my butt to go retrieve this damn thing and \par
you guys are pissed when I come back because I interrupt a movie of some kind."\par
\tab "For your information, Mr. Williams," Carol replied, "what we were \par
watching was no ordinary movie.  In fact, those kids in that dance are the same \par
species as the ones in your trident."  Nick looked at her skeptically.  "Tell \par
him, Troy."\par
\tab "She's right, Professor," Troy said.  "We just figured it out while you \par
were gone.  That thing you're carrying is the seed package for Earth.  Some of \par
the zygotes in there are what Carol calls superhumans.  Genetically engineered \par
humans with more capability than you or me.  Like the kids we just saw."\par
\tab Nick lifted the cradle to eye level.  "I had figured out myself that this \par
thing was a seed package.  But what's this shit about human seeds?"  He glanced \par
at Troy.  "You're serious, aren't you?"  Troy nodded his head.  Troy nodded.  \par
All three of them stared intently at the object in front of them.  Carol kept \par
glancing back and forth from the trident to where the image of the superchildren \par
had been.  "It still doesn't seem possible," Nick added, "but then nothing else \par
has for the last \emdash  "\par
\tab "So what did you forget, Nick?"  Carol interrupted.  "And why did you \par
bring that thing back?"  There was no immediate response from Nick.  "By the \par
way," she smiled, "you missed the show of a lifetime."\par
\tab "The trident was what I forgot," Nick answered.  "It occurred to me, while \par
I was studying the gold objects in the cylinder, that our trident might be a \par
seed package.  And I was worried that it might be dangerous .  .  ."\par
\tab The sudden sound of organ music flooding down the corridor from the large \par
room behind them stopped their conversation.  Nick and Carol looked at Troy.  He \par
put the bracelet up to his ear as if he were listening to it and cracked a large \par
grin.  "I think that's the five-minute warning," Troy said.  "We'd better make \par
our last touchdown and clear out of here."\par
\tab The trio turned and walked back down the corridor to the room with the \par
cylinder.  When they arrived.  Carol and Troy were astonished to see a figure in \par
a blue and white wetsuit on the opposite side of the room.  He was kneeling \par
reverently right next to the cylinder.\par
\tab "Oh, yeah."  said Nick with a nervous laugh, "I forgot to tell you.  \par
Commander Winters came back with me .  .  ."\par
\par
\tab Commander Winters had felt quite comfortable in the water even though he \par
had not been down on a dive in five years.  Nick had gone freestyle, swimming \par
right beside the commander and using the emergency mouthpiece connected to the \par
air supply on Winters' back.  Despite his sense of urgency, Nick had remembered \par
that Winters was basically a novice again and had not rushed the first part of \par
the dive.  But when Winters had refused several times to follow Nick up close to \par
the light in the ocean, Nick had become exasperated.\par
\tab Nick had then taken a final deep breath from the ancillary mouthpiece and \par
grabbed Winters by the shoulders.  With gestures, he had explained to the \par
commander that he, Nick, was going to go through the plastic stuff or whatever \par
it was in front of the light and that Winters could either follow him or not.  \par
The commander had reluctantly given Nick his hand.  Nick turned around \par
immediately and pulled Winters into and through the membrane that separated the \par
alien spaceship from the ocean.\par
\tab Winters had been completely terrified during his tumble on the water slide \par
inside the vehicle.  As a result he had lost his bearings and had had great \par
difficulty standing up after he landed in the splash pool.  Nick was already out \par
of the pool and anxious to find his friends.  "Look," Nick had said, as soon as \par
he could get the commander's attention, "I'm going to leave you now for a few \par
minutes."  He had pointed at the exit on the opposite of the room.  "We'll be in \par
the big room with the high ceilings just on the other side of that wall."  Then \par
he had left carrying the strange golden object from the boat.\par
\tab Winters was left alone.  He carefully pulled himself out on the side of \par
the splash pool and methodically stacked his equipment alongside all the rest of \par
the diving gear.  He looked around the room, noting the curves in the black and \par
white partitions.  He too felt the closeness of the ceiling.  Now according to \par
Williams, the commander thought to himself, I'm in part of an alien spaceship \par
that has temporarily stopped on Earth.  So far, except for that clever one-way \par
entrance that I did not have time to analyze, I see no evidence of \par
extraterrestrial origin .  .  .\par
\tab Comforted by his logic, he eased across the room toward the opposite wall \par
and into the dark corridor.  But his newfound sense of comfort was totally \par
destroyed when he walked into the room dominated by the enormous cylinder with \par
the golden objects floating in the light green liquid.  He arched his back and \par
stared at the vaulted, cathedral ceilings far above his head.  He then \par
approached the cylinder.\par
\tab For Winters, the connection between the trident that Nick had been holding \par
and the objects inside the cylinder was instantaneous.  Those must be more seed \par
packages, destined for other worlds.  Winters thought, his crisp logic \par
disappearing in a quick leap of faith.  With six-root carrots and who knows what \par
else to populate a few of the billions of worlds in our galaxy alone.\par
\tab The commander walked around the cylinder as if he were in a dream.  His \par
mind continually replayed both what Nick had told him right before they \par
descended and the amazing scene he had witnessed when the spiderlike creature \par
had shrunk up and jumped into the golden object.  So it's all true.  All those \par
things the scientists have been saying about the possibility of vast hordes of \par
living creatures out there among the stars.  He stopped for a moment, partially \par
listening to the strange noises behind the walls.  And we are only a few of \par
God's many many children.\par
\tab Organ music, similar in timbre to that which Carol had heard when she had \par
finished playing "Silent Night," but with a different tune, began to sound in \par
the distant reaches of the ceiling above him.  It reminded Winters of church \par
music.  His reaction was instinctual .  He knelt down in front of the cylinder \par
and clasped his hands together in prayer.\par
\tab The music swelled in the room.  What Winters heard in his head was the \par
introduction to the Doxology.  the short hymn that he had heard every single \par
Sunday for eighteen years in the Presbyterian church in Columbus, Indiana.  In \par
his mind's eye he was thirteen years old again and sitting next to Betty in his \par
choir robes.  He smiled at her and they stood up together.\par
\tab Praise God from whom all blessings flow.\par
\tab The choir sang the first phrase of the hymn and Winters' brain was \par
bombarded by a montage of memories from his early teens and before, a suite of \par
epiphanic images of his innocent and unknowing closeness with a parental God, \par
one who was in the wall behind his bed or just over his rooftop or at most in \par
the summer afternoon clouds above Columbus.  Here was an eight-year-old boy \par
praying that his father would not find out that it was he who had set fire to \par
the vacant lot across from the Smith mansion.  Another time, at ten, the little \par
Vernon wept bitter tears as he held his dead cocker spaniel Runtie in his arms \par
and begged the omniscient God to accept his dead dog's soul into heaven.\par
\tab The night before the Easter pageant, the first time that Vernon had \par
portrayed Him in His final hours, dragging the cross to Calvary, eleven-year-old \par
Vernon had been unable to sleep.  As the night was passing by the boy began to \par
panic, began to fear that he would freeze up and forget his lines.  But then he \par
had known what to do.  He had reached under his pillow and found the little New \par
Testament that always stayed there, day and night. He had opened it to Matthew \par
28.  "Go ye therefore," it had said, "baptizing all nations .  .  ."\par
\tab That had been enough.  Then Vernon had prayed for sleep.  His friendly, \par
fatherly God had sent the little boy an image of himself delivering a \par
spellbinding performance in the pageant the next day.  Comforted by that \par
picture, he had fallen asleep.\par
\tab Praise Him all creatures here below.\par
\tab With the second phrase of the hymn resounding in his ears the venue for \par
Winters' mental montage changed to Annapolis Maryland.  He was a young man now, \par
in the last two years of his university work at the Naval Academy.  The pictures \par
that flooded his brain were all taken at the same place, outside the beautiful \par
little Protestant chapel in the middle of the campus.  He was either walking in \par
or walking out.  He went in the snow, in the rain, and in the late summer heat.  \par
He would fulfill his pledge.  He had made a bargain with God, a business deal as \par
it were, you do your part and I'll do mine.  It was no longer a one-sided \par
relationship.  Now, life had taught the serious young midshipman from Indiana \par
that it was necessary to offer this God something in order to guarantee His \par
compliance with the deal.\par
\tab For two years Vernon went regularly to the chapel, twice a week at least.  \par
He did not really worship there; he corresponded with a worldly God, one that \par
read the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.  They discussed things.  \par
Vernon reminded Him that he was steadfastly upholding his end of the deal and \par
thanked Him for keeping His part of the bargain.  But never once did they talk \par
about Joanna Carr.  She didn't matter.  The whole affair was between Midshipman \par
Vernon Winters and God.\par
\tab Praise Him above ye heavenly host.\par
\tab The commander had unconsciously bowed his head almost to the floor by the \par
time he heard the third phrase of the hymn.  In his heart he knew the next stops \par
on this spiritual journey.  He was off the coast of Libya first, praying those \par
horrible words requesting death and destruction for Gaddafi's family.  God had \par
changed as Lieutenant Winters had matured.  He was now an executive, a president \par
of something larger than a nation, an admiral, a judge, somewhat remote, but \par
still accessible in time of real need.\par
\tab However, he had lost his all-forgiving nature.  He had become stern and \par
judgmental.  Killing a small Arab girl wasn't like burning down the vacant lot \par
across from the Smith mansion.  Winters' God now held him personally accountable \par
for all his actions.  And there were some sins almost beyond forgiveness, some \par
deeds so heinous that one might wait for weeks, months, or even years in the \par
anterooms of His court before He would consent to hear your plea for mercy and \par
expiation.\par
\tab Again the commander remembered his desperate search for Him after that \par
awful evening when he had sat on the couch beside his wife and watched the \par
videotaped newsreels of the Libya bombing.  She had been so proud of him.  She \par
had taped every segment of CBS news that had covered the North African \par
engagement and then surprised him with a complete showing the day after he \par
returned to Norfolk.  It was only then that the full horror of what he had done \par
had struck Winters.  Struggling not to vomit as the camera had shown the \par
gruesome result of those missiles that had been fired from his planes, Winters \par
had stumbled out into the night air, alone, and wandered until daybreak.\par
\tab He had been looking for Him.  A dozen times in the next three years this \par
rite would repeat itself and he would wander again, all night, alternately \par
praying and walking, hoping for some sign that He had listened to the \par
commander's prayers.  The stars and moon above him on those nights had been \par
magnificent.  But they could not grant forgiveness, could not give surcease to \par
his troubled soul.\par
\tab Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\par
\tab And so God became blackness, a void, for Commander Winters.  On those rare \par
occasions afterward when he would pray, there was no longer any mental image of \par
God, no picture of Him at all in his mind.  There was just blackness, darkness, \par
emptiness.  Until this moment.  As he knelt there outside the cylinder, heard \par
the final phrase of the Doxology, and prayed to God to forgive him his doubts, \par
his longings for Tiffani Thomas, and his general lack of direction, there was an \par
explosion of light in Winters mind's eye.  God was speaking to him!  God had at \par
last given him a sign!\par
\tab It was not the sign that Winters had been seeking, not evidence that He \par
had finally forgiven the commander and accepted his penance, but something much \par
much better.  The explosion of light in Winter's mind was a star, a solar \par
furnace forging helium out of hydrogen.  As his mental camera backed away \par
rapidly, Winters could see planets around that star and signs of intelligence on \par
a few of the planets.  There were other stars and other planets in the distance.  \par
Billions of stars in this galaxy alone and, after the mammoth voids between the \par
galaxies, more huge collections of stars and planets and living creatures \par
stretching incomprehensible distances in all directions.\par
\tab Winters' body shook with joy and his eyes flooded with tears when he \par
realized how completely God had answered his prayers.  It would not have been \par
enough for Him to simply reveal to Winters that he was forgiven.  No, this Lord \par
of everything imaginable, whose domain embraced chemicals risen to consciousness \par
on millions of worlds in a vast and uncountable universe, this God who was truly \par
omnipotent and ubiquitous, had gone way beyond his prayers.  He had shown \par
Winters the unity in everything.  He had not limited Himself just to the affairs \par
of one individual on a small and insignificant blue planet orbiting an ordinary \par
yellow sun in one of the spiral arms of the Milky Way Galaxy; he had also shown \par
Winters how that species and its pool of intelligence and spirituality was \par
connected to every part of every atom in His grand dominion.\par
\par
\tab As Nick walked across the room toward Commander Winters, the intermittent \par
noises behind the walls increased in amplitude and frequency.  Around on the far \par
side of the cylinder, next to one of the larger support machines, a door opened \par
and two carpets, moving inchworm style, came into the room.  They were \par
immediately followed by two wardens and four platforms on treads.  The platforms \par
were carrying stacks of building materials.  Each of the wardens led two \par
platforms to a corner of the room, where they started constructing secure anchor \par
stanchions for the cylinder.\par
\tab The two carpets confronted Nick in the center of the room.  They stood up \par
on end and leaned in the direction of the exit toward the ocean.  "They're \par
telling us it's time to go," Carol said as she and Troy came up beside Nick.\par
\tab "I understand that," Nick replied.  "But I'm not yet ready to leave."  He \par
turned to Troy.  "Does this game have an X key at all?" he asked.  "I could use \par
a time out."\par
\tab Troy laughed.  "I don't think so, Professor.  And there's no way we can \par
save the game and try again."\par
\tab Nick looked as if he were in deep thought.  The carpets continued to \par
beckon.  "Come on, Nick," Carol grabbed him by the arm.  "Let's go before they \par
get angry."\par
\tab Suddenly Nick advanced toward one of the carpets and extended the golden \par
cradle.  "Here," he said, "take this and put it with the rest of them, up there, \par
in the cylinder where it belongs."  The carpet recoiled and twisted its top from \par
side to side.  Then it pulled its two vertical sides together and pointed at \par
Nick.\par
\tab "I don't need a bracelet to interpret that gesture," Troy remarked.  "The \par
carpet is plainly telling you to take the trident back to your boat."\par
\tab Nick nodded his head and was quiet for a moment.  "Is this the only one?" \par
he asked Troy.  Troy didn't understand the question.  "Is this the only seed \par
package for Earth?"\par
\tab "I think so," Troy answered after a moment's hesitation.  He looked at \par
Nick with a puzzled expression.\par
\tab Meanwhile the activity level in the room had increased substantially.  As \par
Commander Winters ambled toward the trio in the middle of the hubbub, the \par
wardens and platforms were actively building in the corners, moving equipment \par
could be heard behind the walls, and the organ music was growing louder and \par
slightly ominous.  In addition, a giant sock or cover of some kind, lined with a \par
soft, pliant material, had unfurled above them in the ceiling and was descending \par
slowly over the cylinder.  Commander Winters stared around the room with \par
undisguised astonishment.  Still serenely content in his heart from the beauty \par
and intensity of his epiphany, he was not paying much attention to the \par
conversation beside him.\par
\tab "They must take this thing with them," Nick was saying earnestly to Carol \par
and Troy.  "Don't you see?  It's even more important now that I know there are \par
human seedlings inside.  Our children won't have a chance."\par
\tab "But they were so beautiful, so smart," Carol said.  "You didn't see them \par
like we did.  I can't believe those children would ever hurt anybody or \par
anything."\par
\tab They wouldn't mean to destroy us," Nick argued.  "It would just happen."\par
\tab The carpets were starting to jump up and down.  "I know, I know," Nick \par
said as he again extended the cradle toward them.  "You want us to go.  But \par
first, please listen to me.  We've helped you, now I'm asking that you help us.  \par
I'm afraid of what might be in this package, afraid that it might upset the \par
delicate stability of our planet.  Our progress as a species has been slow, in \par
fits and starts, with almost as many backward steps as forward.  Whatever is \par
here could threaten our future development.  Or maybe even halt it altogether."\par
\tab The activity in the room continued unabated.  There was no noticeable \par
reaction to Nick's speech from the impatient carpets, who were now taking turns \par
walking over to the exit in case the dumb humans still did not understand their \par
message.  Nick looked entreatingly at Carol.  She returned his gaze and smiled.  \par
After a few seconds she came over and took his hand.  Their eyes met for a brief \par
moment as she started talking and Nick saw a new expression, something \par
approaching admiration, in her glance.\par
\tab "He's right, you know," Carol said in the direction of the pair of \par
carpets.  "You haven't thought carefully enough about the outcome of this \par
mission of yours.  Sooner or later your special embryos and the humans already \par
on this planet will interact and there will be a catastrophe.  If the seed \par
package is found early in the development of your superhumans, I am certain the \par
Earthlings will feel compelled to destroy it.  What possible other reaction \par
could they have?  The magnitude of the threat may not be fully known, but it is \par
easy to recognize that creatures genetically engineered by superaliens could \par
pose a gigantic problem for the native species of this planet."\par
\tab Troy was standing just behind Nick and Carol, listening attentively to \par
what she was saying.  Around him the preparations for launch continued.  The \par
wardens and platforms had finished constructing and installing the two pairs of \par
stanchions that would be connected to the cylinder during launch to minimize \par
vibrations.  The golden cradles in the cylinder could no longer be seen; the \par
cover had descended almost to the floor.\par
\tab ".  .  .  So unless you take this golden package back with you, perhaps to \par
place it on another world which does not yet have intelligence, there will be \par
unnecessary death.  Either your seedlings will perish before maturity or the \par
native humans like us will eventually be swallowed up, if not killed outright, \par
by the more capable beings you have engineered.  That hardly seems to be a fair \par
reward for our effort on your behalf."\par
\tab Carol stopped to watch four strange cords extend themselves from the top \par
and near the bottom of the cylinder, wriggle through the air, and end up \par
attached to the stanchions in the corners of the room.  The carpets were \par
becoming increasingly agitated.  The two wardens finished supervising their \par
prelaunch procedures.  They turned abruptly toward the four human beings and \par
moved in their direction.\par
\tab Carol tightened her hold on Nick's hand.  "Perhaps it's true that our \par
natural development is a slow and not altogether satisfactory process, " she \par
continued, fear creeping into her voice as the dreaded wardens quickly \par
approached them, "and it's certainly true that we humans here make mistakes, \par
both as individuals and as groups .  However, you can't overlook the fact that \par
this imperfect process produced us, and we had enough foresight or compassion or \par
whatever you want to call it \emdash  "\par
\tab "Hold it," shouted Troy.  He seized the cradle from Nick's hand and jumped \par
directly into the path of one of the menacing wardens.  He was only inches away \par
from two whirling, threatening rods with cutting implements on the end.  "Hold \par
it," he shouted again.  Miraculously, all activity ceased.  The carpets and \par
wardens stood still, the noises in the wall stopped, even the organ music was \par
silenced.  "Of all of us," Troy said in a loud voice, his head tilted back and \par
aimed at the ceiling, "I have the most knowledge of what your mission is all \par
about.  And the most to lose by recommending that you abandon this part of it.  \par
But I agree with my friends."\par
\tab Troy removed his bracelet and then dramatically jammed both the bracelet \par
and the cradle inside the warden.  He felt as if he were plunging his hand into \par
a bowl of hot bread dough.  He released both objects and withdrew his hand.  The \par
warden didn't move.  The bracelet and the cradle remained where Troy left them \par
inside the warden's body.\par
\tab "From the very beginning I realized that the bracelet you gave me enabled \par
me to have special powers, talents that were not naturally mine.  I understood, \par
without knowing the specifics, that there would be a substantial and continuing \par
reward for my helping you.  And I thought that finally, finally, Troy Jefferson \par
would be somebody special in this world."\par
\tab Troy walked past the amazed Commander Winters, who was following the \par
proceedings with a peaceful detachment, and came up beside Nick and Carol.  It \par
was absolutely quiet in the room.  "When my brother, Jamie, was killed," he \par
began again softly, "I swore that I would do whatever was necessary to leave my \par
imprint on society.  During those two years that I wandered all over the \par
country, I spent most of my time daydreaming.  My dreams all had the same \par
conclusion.  I would discover something new and earthshaking and become both \par
rich and famous overnight."\par
\tab Troy gave Carol a quick kiss and winked.  "I love you, angel," he said.  \par
"And you too, Professor."  Troy then turned around and faced the covered \par
cylinder.  "When I left here on Thursday afternoon, I was so excited I couldn't \par
contain myself.  I kept saymg, 'Shit, Jefferson, here it is.  You are going to \par
be the most important man in the history of the fucking world.' "\par
\tab Troy paused.  "But I have learned something very important these last \par
three days," he said, "something that most of us probably never consider.  It is \par
that the process is more important than the end result.  It is what you learn \par
while you're dreaming or scheming or working toward a goal that is essential and \par
valuable, not the achievement of the goal itself.  And that's why you guys must \par
now do what my friends have asked.\par
\tab "I know that you ETs have tried to explain to me in these last several \par
minutes, through the bracelet that you offered me for life, that the new humans \par
you are depositing here will lead us primitive beings into a bold and wonderful \par
era.  That may be true.  And I agree that we could use some help, that our \par
species is full of prejudice and selfishness and all kinds of other problems.  \par
But you cannot simply give us the answers.  Without the benefit of the struggle \par
to improve ourselves, without the process of overcoming our own weaknesses, \par
there will be no fundamental change in us old humans.  We will not become \par
better.  We will become second-class citizens, acolytes in a future of your \par
vision and design.  So take your perfect humans away and let us make it on our \par
own.  We deserve the chance."\par
\tab There was no movement in the room for several seconds after Troy finished.  \par
Then the warden in front of him jerked sideways and began to move.  Troy braced \par
for an attack.  But the warden moved in the direction of the exit next to the \par
cylinder.  The bracelet and cradle could still be seen inside its body.\par
\tab "All right, team," Troy shouted happily.  Nick and Carol hugged.  Troy \par
took Commander Winters by the hand.  As they were leaving, the four of them \par
turned around one last time to look at the large chamber.  In this final view, \par
each one of them saw the room in terms of his own amazing experiences.  The \par
noises had begun again behind the walls.  And the carpets, platforms, and \par
wardens were filing out of the room through the door beside the covered \par
cylinder.\par
\par
\tab They had only been onboard the boat for three or four minutes when the \par
water underneath them suddenly became very turbulent.  They were strangely \par
quiet, all four of them.  A frustrated Lieutenant Ramirez paced about the deck, \par
trying to get someone to tell him what had happened under the water.  Even \par
Commander Winters virtually ignored the lieutenant and just shook his head or \par
gave simple answers to all his questions.\par
\tab They were certain that the spaceship was about to launch.  They didn't \par
realize that it would glide gently away from their area first, so that it would \par
not submerge them with a giant wave, before breaking the water and heading into \par
the sky.  The water stayed agitated for several minutes.  All of them scanned \par
the ocean for a sign of the vehicle.\par
\tab "Look," yelled Commander Winters excitedly, pointing at a giant silver \par
bird lifting into the sky about forty-five degrees away from the early morning \par
sun.  Its rise was initially slow, but as it rose it accelerated rapidly.  Nick \par
and Carol and Troy clasped hands tightly as they watched the awesome spectacle.  \par
Winters came over and stood beside the trio.  After thirty seconds the craft had \par
disappeared above the clouds.  There was never any sound.\par
\tab "Fantastic," said Commander Winters.\par
