<P>The worlds of Frank Herbert are many and fasci&#173;nating.
Aliens play games with Earth as their play&#173;ground. Advertising
put sex back into the Space Force. The Bureau of Sabotage keeps
governments operating at a nice slow rate. And things are rarely
what they seem . . . and no one heeds the warn&#173;ings until the
cosmic jokers' laughter echoes through the galaxy.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ivor Norris Gump, professional troubleshooter, goes down the
tubes.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen Everest masterminds the craziest ad cam&#173;paign of the
century.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>William R. Custer sets out to save the world by giving it its
most destructive weapon.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>And aliens and Earthlings wander through a maze of galactic
happenings, never ending up quite where they expected but always
ending up somewhere.</P>

<P><STRONG>FRANK HERBERT,</STRONG> whose work has been compared to
such widely varied writers as Aldous Huxley and Edgar Rice
Burroughs, has been a newspaperman on the West Coast for many
years. Both a writer and professional photographer, he is also a
student of subjects ranging from Oriental religions to jungle
botany and undersea geology. His rich background of experience
includes work as a television cameraman, radio news commentator,
oyster, diver, jungle survival instructor, lay analyst, and teacher
of creative writing.</P>

<P> </P>
<P>'Better men than you have tried!' snarled Clinton Watt.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I quote paragraph four, section ninety-one of the Semantic
Revision to the Constitution,' said saboteur extraordinary Jorj X.
McKie. ''The need for obstructive processes in government having
been established as one of the chief safeguards for human rights,
the question of immunities must be defined with extreme
precision.''</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie sat across a glistening desk from the Intergalactic
Government's Secretary of Sabotage, Clinton Watt. An air of tension
filled the green-walled office, carrying over into the screen-view
behind Watt which showed an expanse of the System Government's
compound and people scurrying about their morning business with a
sense of urgency.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Watt, a small man who appeared to crackle with suppressed
energy, passed a hand across his shaven head. 'All right,' he said
in a suddenly tired voice. 'This is the only Secretariat of
government that's never immune from sabotage. You've satisfied the
legalities by quoting the law. Now, do your damnedest!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie, whose bulk and fat features usually gave him the
appearance of a grandfatherly toad, glowered like a gnome-dragon.
His mane of red hair appeared to dance with inner flame.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Damnedest!' he snapped. 'You think I came in here to try to
unseat you? You think that?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>And McKie thought: <EM>Let's hope he thinks that!</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Stop the act, McKie!' Watt said. 'We both know you're eligible
for this chair.' He patted the arm of his chair. 'And we both know
the only way you can eliminate me and qualify yourself for the
appointment is to overcome me with a masterful sabotage. Well,
McKie, I've sat here more than eighteen years. Another five months
and it'll be a new record. Do your damnedest. I'm waiting.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I came in here for only one reason,' McKie said. 'I want to
report on the search for saboteur extraordinary Napoleon
Bildoon.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie sat back wondering: <EM>If Watt knew my real purpose here
would he act just this way? Perhaps.</EM> The man had been behaving
oddly since the start of this interview, but it was difficult to
determine real motive when dealing with a fellow member of the
Bureau of Sabotage.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Cautious interest quickened Watt's bony face. He wet his lips
with his tongue and it was obvious he was asking himself if this
were more of an elaborate ruse. But McKie had been assigned the
task of searching for the missing agent, Bildoon, and it was just
possible ...</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Have you found him?' Watt asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>I'm not sure,' McKie said. He ran his fingers through his red
hair. 'Bildoon's a Pan-Spechi, you know.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'For disruption's sake!' Watt exploded. 'I know who and what my
own agents are! But we take care of our own. And when one of our
best people just drops from sight ... What's this about not being
sure?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The Pan-Spechi are a curious race of creatures,' McKie said.
'Just because they've taken on humanoid shape we tend to forget
their five-phase life cycle.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Bildoon told me himself he'd hold his group's ego at least
another ten years,' Watt said. 'I think he was being truthful, but
...' Watt shrugged and some of the bursting energy seemed to leave
him. 'Well, the group ego's the only place where the Pan-Spechi
show vanity, so ...' Again he shrugged.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'My questioning of the other Pan-Spechi in the Bureau has had to
be circumspect, of course,' McKie said. 'But I did follow one lead
clear to Achus.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie brought a white vial from his copious jacket, scattered a
metallic powder on the desktop.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Watt pushed himself back from the desk, eyeing the powder with
suspicion. He took a cautious sniff, smelled chalf, the
quick-scribe powder. Still ...</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It's just chalf,' McKie said. And he thought: <EM>If he buys
that, I may get away with this.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'So scribe it,' Watt said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Concealing his elation, McKie held a chalf-memory stick over the
dusted surface. A broken circle with arrows pointing to a
right-hand flow appeared in the chalf. At each break in the circle
stood a symbol - in one place the Pan-Spechi character for ego,
then the delta for fifth gender and, finally, the three lines that
signified the dormant cr&#232;che-triplets.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie pointed to the fifth gender delta. 'I've seen a Pan-Spechi
in this position who looks a bit like Bildoon and <EM>appears</EM>
to have some of his mannerisms. There's no identity response from
the creature, of course. Well, you know how the quasi-feminine
fifth gender reacts.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Don't ever let that amorous attitude fool you,' Watt warned.
'In spite of your nasty disposition I wouldn't want to lose you
into a Pan-Spechi cr&#232;che.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Bildoon wouldn't rob a fellow agent's identity,' McKie said. He
pulled at his lower lip, feeling an abrupt uncertainty. Here, of
course, was the most touchy part of the whole scheme. 'If it was
Bildoon.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Did you meet this group's ego holder?' Watt asked and his voice
betrayed real interest.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'No,' McKie said. 'But I think the ego-single of this Pan-Spechi
is involved with the Tax Watchers.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie waited, wondering if Watt would rise to the bait.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I've never heard of an ego change being forced onto a
Pan-Spechi,' Watt said in a musing tone, 'but that doesn't mean
it's impossible. If those Tax Watcher do gooders found Bildoon
sabotaging their efforts and ... Hmmm.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Then Bildoon was after the Tax Watchers,' McKie said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Watt scowled. McKie's question was in extreme bad taste. Senior
agents, unless joined on a project or where the information was
volunteered, didn't snoop openly into the work of their fellows.
Left hand and right hand remained mutually ignorant in the Bureau
of Sabotage and for good reason. Unless ... Watt stared
speculatively at his saboteur extraordinary.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie shrugged as Watt remained silent. 'I can't operate on
inadequate information,' he said. 'I must, therefore, resign the
assignment to search for Bildoon. Instead, I will now look into the
Tax Watchers.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You will not!' Watt snapped.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie forced himself not to look at the design he had drawn on
the desktop. The next few moments were the critical ones.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You'd better have a legal reason for that refusal,' McKie
said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Watt swiveled sideways in his chair, glanced at the screenview,
then addressed himself to the side wall. 'The situation has become
one of extreme delicacy, Jorj. It's well known that you're one of
our finest saboteurs.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Save your oil for someone who needs it,' McKie growled.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Then I'll put it this way,' Watt said, returning his gaze to
McKie. 'The Tax Watchers in the last few days have posed a real
threat to the Bureau. They've managed to convince a High Court
magistrate they deserve the same immunity from our ministrations
that a ... well, public water works or ... ah ... food processing
plant might enjoy. The magistrate, Judge Edwin Dooley, invoked the
Public Safety amendment. Our hands are tied. The slightest
suspicion that we've disobeyed the injunction and ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Watt drew a finger across his throat.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Then I quit,' McKie said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You'll do nothing of the kind!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'This TW outfit is trying to eliminate the Bureau, isn't it?'
McKie asked. 'I remember the oath I took just as well as you
do.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Jorj, you couldn't be that much of a simpleton,' Watt said.
'You quit, thinking that absolves the Bureau from responsibility
for you! That trick's as old as time!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Then fire me!' McKie said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I've no legal reason to fire you Jorj.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Refusal to obey orders of a superior,' McKie said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It wouldn't fool anybody, you dolt!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie appeared to hesitate, said: 'Well, the public doesn't know
the inner machinery of how we change the Bureau's command. Perhaps
it's time we opened up.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Jorj, before I could fire you there'd have to be a reason so
convincing that ... Just forget it.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie's eyes lifted until the eyes were mere slits. The crucial
few moments had arrived. He had managed to smuggle a Jicuzzi stim
into this office past all of Watt's detectors, concealing the
thing's detectable radiation core within an imitation of the lapel
badge that Bureau agents wore.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'In Lieu of Red Tape,' McKie said and touched the badge with a
finger, feeling the raised letters there - 'ILRT.' The touch
focused the radiation core onto the metallic dust scattered over
the desktop.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Watt gripped the arms of the chair, studying McKie with a new
look of wary tension.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We are under legal injunction to keep hands off the Tax
Watchers,' Watt said. 'Anything that happens to those people or to
their project for scuttling us - even legitimate accidents - will
be laid at our door. We must be able to defend ourselves. No one
who has ever been connected with us dares fall under the slightest
suspicion of complicity.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'How about a floor waxed to dangerous slickness in the path of
one of their messengers? How about a doorlock changed to delay
-'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Nothing.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie stared at his chief. Everything depended now on the man
holding very still. He knew Watt wore detectors to warn him of
concentrated beams of radiation. But this Jicuzzi stim had been
rigged to diffuse its charge off the metallic dust on the desk and
that required several seconds of relative quiet.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The men held themselves rigid in the staredown until Watt began
to wonder at the extreme stillness of McKie's body. The man was
even holding his breath!</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie took a deep breath, stood up.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I warn you, Jorj,' Watt said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Warn me?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I can restrain you by physical means if necessary.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Clint, old enemy, save your breath. What's done is done.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A smile touched McKie's wide mouth. He turned, crossed to the
room's only door, paused there, hand on knob.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What have you done?' Watt exploded.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie continued to look at him.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Watt's scalp began itching madly. He put a hand there, felt a
long tangle of ... tendrils! They were lengthening under his
fingers, growing out of his scalp, waving and writhing.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'A Jicuzzi stim,' Watt breathed.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie let himself out, closed the door.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Watt leaped out of his chair, raced to the door.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Locked!</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He knew McKie and didn't try unlocking it. Frantically, Watt
slapped a molecular dispersion wad against the door, dived through
as the wad blasted. He landed in the outer hall, stared first one
direction, then the other.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The hall was empty.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Watt sighed. The tendrils had stopped growing, but they were
long enough now that he could see them writhing past his eyes - a
rainbow mass of wrigglers, part of himself. And McKie with the
original stim was the only one who could reverse the process -
unless Watt were willing to spend an interminable time with the
Jicuzzi themselves. No. That was out of the question.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Watt began assessing his position.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The stim tendrils couldn't be removed surgically, couldn't be
tied down or contained in any kind of disguise without endangering
the person afflicted with them. Their presence would hamper him,
too, during this critical time of trouble with the Tax Watchers.
How could he appear in conferences and interviews with these things
writhing in their Medusa dance on his head? It would be laughable!
He'd be an object of comedy.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>And if McKie could stay out of the way until a Case of
Exchangement was brought before the full Cabinet ... But, no! Watt
shook his head. This wasn't the kind of sabotage that required a
change of command in the Bureau. This was a gross thing. No
subtlety to it. This was like a practical joke. Clownish.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>But McKie was noted for his clownish attitude, his irreverence
for all the blundering self-importance of government.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Have I been self-important?</EM> Watt wondered.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>In all honesty, he had to admit it.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>I'll have to submit my resignation today,</EM> he thought.
<EM>Right after I fire McKie. One look at me and there'll be no
doubt of why I did it. This is about as convincing a reason as you
could find.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>Watt turned to his right, headed for the lab to see if they
could help him bring this wriggling mass under control.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>The President will want me to stay at the helm until McKie
makes his next move,</EM> Watt thought. <EM>I have to be able to
function somehow.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1"><STRONG>Chapter II</STRONG></P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie waited in the living room of the Achusian mansion with ill
concealed unease. Achus was the administrative planet for the
Vulpecula region, an area of great wealth, and this room high on a
mountaintop commanded a natural view to the southwest across lesser
peaks and foothills misted in purple by a westering G3 sun.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>But McKie ignored the view, trying to watch all corners of the
room at once. He had seen a fifth gender Pan-Spechi here in company
with the fourth-gender ego-holder. That could only mean the
cr&#232;che with its three dormants was nearby. By all accounts,
this was a dangerous place for someone not protected by bonds of
friendship and community of interest.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The value of the Pan-Spechi to the universal human society in
which they participated was beyond question. What other species had
such refined finesse in deciding when to hinder and when to help?
Who else could send a key member of its group into circumstances of
extreme peril without fear that the endangered one's knowledge
would be lost?</P>
<P> </P>
<P>There was always a dormant to take up where the lost one had
left off.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Still, the Pan-Spechi did have their idiosyncrasies. And their
hungers were at times bizarre.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ahh, McKie.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The voice, deep and masculine, came from his left. McKie whirled
to study the figure that came through a door carved from a single
artificial emerald of glittering cr&#232;me de menthe colors.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The speaker was humanoid but with Pan-Spechi multi-faceted eyes.
He appeared to be a terranic man (except for the blue-green eyes)
of an indeterminate, well-preserved middle age. The body suggested
a certain daintiness in its yellow tights and singlet. The head was
squared in outline with close-cropped blond hair, a fleshy chunk of
nose and thick splash of mouth.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Panthor Bolin here,' the Pan-Spechi said. 'You are welcome in
my home, Jorj McKie.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie relaxed slightly. Pan-Spechi were noted for honoring
hospitality once it was extended ... provided the guest didn't
violate their mores.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm honored that you've agreed to see me,' McKie said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The honor is mine,' Bolin said. 'We've long recognized you as a
person whose understanding of the Pan-Spechi is most subtle and
penetrating. I've longed for the chance to have uninhibited
conversation with you. And here you are.' He indicated a chairdog
against the wall to his right, snapped his fingers. The
semi-sentient artifact glided to a position behind McKie. 'Please
be seated.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie, his caution re-alerted by Bolin's reference to
'uninhibited conversation,' sank into the chairdog, patting it
until it assumed the contours he wanted.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Bolin took a chairdog facing him, leaving only about a meter
separating their knees.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Have your egos shared nearness before?' McKie asked. 'You
appeared to recognize me.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Recognition goes deeper than ego,' Bolin said. 'Do you wish to
join identities and explore this question?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie wet his lips with his tongue. This was delicate ground
with the Pan-Spechi, whose one ego moved somehow from member to
member of the unit group as they traversed their <EM>circle of
being.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I ... ah ... not at this time,' McKie said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Well spoken,' Bolin said. 'Should you ever change your mind, my
ego-group would consider it a most signal honor. Yours is a strong
identity, one we respect.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm ... most honored,' McKie said. He rubbed nervously at his
jaw, recognizing the dangers in this conversation. Each Pan-Spechi
group maintained a supremely jealous attitude of and about its
wandering ego. The ego imbued the holder of it with a touchy sense
of honor. Inquiries about it could be carried out only through such
formula questions as McKie already had asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Still, if this were a member of the pentarchal life circle
containing the missing saboteur extraordinary Napoleon Bildoon ...
if it were, much would be explained.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You're wondering if we really can communicate,' Bolin said.
McKie nodded.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The concept <EM>of humanity,'</EM> Bolin said, '- our term for
it would translate approximately as <EM>comsentiency -</EM> has
been extended to encompass many different shapes, life systems and
methods of mentation. And yet we have never been sure about this
question. It's one of the major reasons many of us have adopted
your life-shape and much of your metabolism. We wished to
experience your strengths and your weaknesses. This helps ... but
is not an absolute solution.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Weaknesses?' McKie asked, suddenly wary.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ahhh-hummm,' Bolin said. 'I see. To allay your suspicions I
will have translated for you soon one of our major works. One of
the strongest sympathetic bonds we have with your species, for
example, is the fact that we both originated as extremely
vulnerable surface-bound creatures whose most sophisticated defense
came to be the social structure.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'll be most interested to see the translation,' McKie
said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Do you wish more amenities or do you care to state your
business now?' Bolin asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I was ... ah ... assigned to seek out a missing agent of our
Bureau,' McKie said, 'to be certain no harm had befallen this ...
ah ... agent.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Your avoidance of gender is most refined,' Bolin said. 'I
appreciate the delicacy of your position and your good taste. I
will say this for now: the Pan-Spechi you seek is not at this time
in need of your assistance. Your concern, however, is appreciated.
It will be communicated to those upon whom it will have the most
influence.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That's a great relief to me,' McKie said. And he wondered:
<EM>What did he really mean by that?</EM> This thought elicited
another, and McKie said: 'Whenever I run into this problem of
communication between species I'm reminded of an old
culture/teaching story.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh?' Bolin registered polite curiosity.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Two practitioners of the art of mental healing, so the story
goes, passed each other every morning on their way to their
respective offices. They knew each other, but weren't on intimate
terms. One morning as they approached each other, one of them
turned to the other and said, 'Good morning.' The one greeted
failed to respond, but continued toward his office. Presently,
though he stopped, turned and stared at the retreating back of the
man who'd spoken, musing to himself: 'Now, what did he really mean
by that?''</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Bolin began to chuckle, then laugh. His laughter grew louder and
louder until he was holding his sides.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>It wasn't that funny,</EM> McKie thought.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Bolin's laughter subsided. 'A very educational story,' he said.
'I'm deeply indebted to you. This story shows your awareness of how
important it is in communication that we be aware of the other's
identity.'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Does it?</EM> McKie wondered. <EM>How's that?</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>And McKie found himself caught up by his knowledge of how the
Pan-Spechi could pass a single ego-identity from individual to
individual within the life circle group of five distinct
protoplasmic units. He wondered how it felt when the ego-holder
gave up the identity to become the fifth gender, passing the ego
spark to a newly matured unit from the cr&#232;che. Did the fifth
gender willingly become cr&#232;che nurse and give itself up as a
mysterious identity-food for the three dormants in the cr&#232;che?
he wondered.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I heard about what you did to Secretary of Sabotage Clinton
Watt,' Bolin said. 'The story of your dismissal from the service
preceded you here.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes,' McKie said. 'That's why I'm here, too.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You've penetrated to the fact that our Pan-Spechi community
here on Achus is the heart of the Tax Watchers' organization,'
Bolin said. 'It was very brave of you to walk right into our hands.
I understand how much more courage it takes for your kind to face
unit extinction than it does for our kind. Admirable! You are
indeed a prize.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie fought down a sensation of panic, reminding himself that
the records he had left in his private locker of Bureau
headquarters could be deciphered in time even if he did not
return.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes,' Bolin said, 'you wish to satisfy yourself that the
ascension of a Pan-Spechi to the head of your Bureau will pose no
threat to other human species. This is understandable.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie shook his head to clear it. 'Do you read minds?' he
demanded.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Telepathy is not one of our accomplishments,' Bolin said, his
voice heavy with menace. 'I do hope that was a generalized question
and in no way directed at the intimacies of my ego-group.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I felt that you were reading my mind,' McKie said, tensing
himself for defense.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That was how I interpreted the question,' Bolin said. 'Forgive
my question. I should not have doubted your delicacy or your
tact.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You do hope to place a member in the job of Bureau Secretary,
though?' McKie said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Remarkable that you should've suspected it,' Bolin said. 'How
can you be sure our intention is not merely to destroy the
Bureau?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm not.' McKie glanced around the room, regretting that he had
been forced to act alone.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Where did we give ourselves away?' Bolin mused.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Let me remind you,' McKie said, 'that I have accepted the
hospitality you offered and that I've not offended your mores.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Most remarkable,' Bolin said. 'In spite of all the temptations
I offered, you have not offended our mores. This is true. You are
an embarrassment, indeed you are. But perhaps you have a weapon.
Yes?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie lifted a wavering <EM>shape</EM> from an inner pocket.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ahhh, the Jicuzzi stim,' Bolin said. 'Now, let me see, is that
a weapon?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie held the <EM>shape</EM> on his palm. It appeared flat at
first, like a palm-sized sheet of pink paper. Gradually, the
flatness grew a superimposed image of a tube laid on its surface,
then another image of an S-curved spring that coiled and wound
around the tube.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Our species can control its shape to some extent,' Bolin said.
'There's some question on whether I can consider this a
weapon.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie curled his fingers around the <EM>shape,</EM> squeezed.
There came a pop, and fumaroles of purple light emerged between his
fingers accompanied by an odor of burnt sugar.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Exit stim,' McKie said. 'Now I'm completely defenseless,
entirely dependent upon your hospitality.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ah, you are a tricky one,' Bolin said. 'But have you no regard
for Sec Clinton Watt? To him, the change you forced upon him is an
affliction. You've destroyed the instrument that might have
reversed the process.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'He can apply to the Jicuzzi,' McKie said, wondering why Bolin
should concern himself over Watt.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ah, but they will ask your permission to intervene,' Bolin
said. 'They are so formal. Drafting their request should take at
least three standard years. They will not take the slightest chance
of offending you. And you, of course, cannot volunteer your
permission without offending them. You know, they may even build a
nerve-image of you upon which to test their petition. You are not a
callous person, McKie, in spite of your clownish poses. I'd not
realized how important this confrontation was to you.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Since I'm completely at your mercy,' McKie said, 'would you try
to stop me from leaving here?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'An interesting question,' Bolin said. 'You have information I
don't want revealed at this time. You're aware of this,
naturally?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Naturally.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I find the constitution a most wonderful document,' Bolin said.
'The profound awareness of the individual's identity and its
relationship to society as a whole. Of particular interest is the
portion dealing with the Bureau of Sabotage, those amendments
recognizing that the Bureau itself might at times need ... ah ...
adjustment.'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Now what's he driving at?</EM> McKie wondered. And he noted
how Bolin squinted his eyes in thought, leaving only a thin line of
faceted glitter.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I shall speak now as chief officer of the Tax Watchers,' Bolin
said, 'reminding you that we are legally immune from sabotage.'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>I've found out what I wanted to know,</EM> McKie thought.
Now if I can only get out of here with <EM>it!</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Let us consider the training of saboteurs extraordinary,' Bolin
said. 'What do the trainees learn about the make-work and
feather-bedding elements in Bureau activity'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>He's not going to trap me in a lie,</EM> McKie thought. 'We
come right out and tell our trainees that one of our chief
functions is to create jobs for the politicians to fill,' he said.
'The more hands in the pie, the slower the mixing.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You've heard that telling a falsehood to your host is a great
breach of Pan-Spechi mores, I see,' Bolin said. 'You understand, of
course, that refusal to answer certain questions is interpreted as
a falsehood?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'So I've been told,' McKie said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Wonderful! And what are your trainees told about the foot
dragging and the monkeywrenches you throw into the path of
legislation?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I quote from the pertinent training brochure,' McKie said. ''A
major function of the Bureau is to slow passage of
legislation.''</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Magnificent! And what about the disputes and outright battles
Bureau agents have been known to incite?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Strictly routine,' McKie said. 'We're duty bound to encourage
the growth of anger in government wherever we can. It exposes the
temperamental types, the ones who can't control themselves, who
can't think on their feet.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ah,' Bolin said. 'How entertaining.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We keep entertainment value in mind,' McKie admitted. 'We use
drama and flamboyance wherever possible to keep our activities
fascinating to the public.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Flamboyant obstructionism,' Bolin mused.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Obstruction is a factor in strength,' McKie said. 'Only the
strongest surmount the obstructions to succeed in government. The
strongest ... or the most devious, which is more or less the same
thing when it comes to government.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'How illuminating,' Bolin said. He rubbed the backs of his
hands, a Pan-Spechi mannerism denoting satisfaction. 'Do you have
special instructions regarding political parties?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We stir up dissent between them,' McKie said. 'Opposition tends
to expose reality, that's one of our axioms.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Would you characterize Bureau agents as troublemakers?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Of course! My parents were happy as the devil when I showed
troublemaking tendencies at an early age. They knew there'd be a
lucrative outlet for this when I grew up. They saw to it that I was
channeled in the right directions all through school - special
classes in Applied Destruction, Advanced Irritation, Anger I and II
... only the best teachers.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You're suggesting the Bureau's an outlet for society's regular
crop of 'troublemakers?''</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Isn't that obvious? And troublemakers naturally call for the
services of troubleshooters. That's an outlet for do-gooders.
You've a check and balance system serving society.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie waited, watching the Pan-Spechi, wondering if his answers
had gone far enough.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I speak as a Tax Watcher, you understand?' Bolin asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I understand.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The public pays for this Bureau. In essence, the public is
paying people to cause trouble.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Isn't that what we do when we hire police, tax investigators
and the like?' McKie asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A look of gloating satisfaction came over Bolin's face. 'But
these agencies operate for the greater good of humanity!' he
said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Before he begins training,' McKie said, and his voice took on a
solemn, lecturing tone, 'the potential saboteur is shown the entire
sordid record of history. The do-gooders succeeded once ... long
ago. They eliminated virtually all red tape from government. This
great machine with its power over human lives slipped into high
speed. It moved faster and faster.' McKie's voice grew louder.
'Laws were conceived and passed in the same hour! Appropriations
came and were gone in a fortnight. New bureaus flashed into
existence for the most insubstantial reasons.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie took a deep breath, realizing he'd put sincere emotional
weight behind his words.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Fascinating,' Bolin said. 'Efficient government, eh?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Efficient?' McKie's voice was filled with outrage. 'It was like
a great wheel thrown suddenly out of balance! The whole structure
of government was in imminent danger of fragmenting before a
handful of people, wise with hindsight, used measures of
desperation and started what was called the Sabotage Corps.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ahhh, yes, I've heard about the Corps' violence.'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>He's needling me,</EM> McKie thought, but found that honest
anger helped now. 'All right, there was bloodshed and terrible
destruction at the beginning,' he said. 'But the big wheels were
slowed. Government developed a controllable speed.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Sabotage,' Bolin sneered. 'In lieu of red tape.'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>I needed that reminder,</EM> McKie thought.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'No task too small for Sabotage, no task too large,' McKie said.
'We keep the wheel turning slowly and smoothly. Some anonymous
Corpsman put it into words a long time ago: 'When in doubt, delay
the big ones and speed the little ones.''</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Would you say the Tax Watchers were a 'big one' or a 'little
one'?' Bolin asked, his voice mild.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Big one,' McKie said and waited for Bolin to pounce.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>But the Pan-Spechi appeared amused. 'An unhappy answer.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'As it says in the Constitution,' McKie said. ''The pursuit of
unhappiness is an inalienable right of all humans.''</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Trouble is as trouble does,' Bolin said and clapped his
hands.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Two Pan-Spechi in the uniforms of system police came through the
cr&#232;me de menthe emerald door.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You heard?' Bolin asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We heard,' one of the police said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Was he defending his bureau?' Bolin asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'He was,' the policeman said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You've seen the court order,' Bolin said. 'It pains me because
Ser McKie accepted the hospitality of my house, but he must be held
incommunicado until he's needed in court. He's to be treated
kindly, you understand?'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Is he really bent on destroying the Bureau?</EM> McKie asked
himself in sudden consternation. <EM>Do I have it figured
wrong?</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You contend my words were sabotage?' McKie asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Clearly an attempt to sway the chief officer of the Tax
Watchers from his avowed duties,' Bolin said. He stood, bowed.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie lifted himself out of the chairdog, assumed an air of
confidence he did not feel. He clasped his thick-fingered hands
together and bowed low, a grandfather toad rising from the deep to
give his benediction. 'In the words of the ancient proverb,' he
said, ''The righteous man lives deep within a cavern and the sky
appears to him as nothing but a small round hole.''</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Wrapping himself in dignity, McKie allowed the police to escort
him from the room.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Behind him, Bolin gave voice to puzzlement: 'Now, what did he
mean by that?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1"><STRONG>Chapter III</STRONG></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Hear ye! Hear ye! System High Court, First Bench, Central
Sector, is now in session!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The robo-clerk darted back and forth across the cleared lift
dais of the courtarena, its metal curves glittering in the morning
light that poured down through the domed weather cover. Its voice,
designed to fit precisely into the great circular room, penetrated
to the farthest walls: 'All persons having petitions before this
court draw near!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The silvery half globe carrying First Magistrate Edwin Dooley
glided through an aperture behind the lift dais and was raised to
an appropriate height. His white sword of justice lay diagonally
across the bench in front of him. Dooley himself sat in dignified
silence while the robo-clerk finished its stentorian announcement
and rolled to a stop just beyond the lift field.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Judge Dooley was a tall, black browed man who affected the
ancient look with ebon robes over white linen. He was noted for
decisions of classic penetration.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He sat now with his face held in rigid immobility to conceal his
anger and disquiet. Why had they put him in this hot spot? Because
he'd granted the Tax Watchers' injunction? No matter how he ruled
now, the result likely would be uproar. Even President Bindley was
watching this one through one of the hot-line projectors.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The President had called shortly before this session. It had
been Phil and Ed all through the conversation, but the intent
remained clear. The Administration was concerned about this case.
Vital legislation pended; votes were needed. Neither the budget nor
the Bureau of Sabotage had entered their conversation, but the
President had made his point - <EM>don't compromise the Bureau but
save that Tax Watcher support for the Administration!</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Clerk, the roster,' Judge Dooley said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>And he thought: <EM>They'll get judgment according to strict
interpretation of the law! Let them argue with that!</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>The robo-clerk's reelslate buzzed. Words appeared on the
repeater in front of the judge as the clerk's voice announced: 'The
People versus Clifton Watt, Jorj X. McKie and the Bureau of
Sabotage.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Dooley looked down into the courtarena, noting the group seated
at the black oblong table in the Defense ring on his left: a
sour-faced Watt with his rainbow horror of Medusa head, McKie's fat
features composed in the look of someone trying not to snicker at a
sly joke - the two defendants flanking their attorney, Pander
Oulson, the Bureau of Sabotage's chief counsel. Oulson was a great
thug of a figure in defense white with glistening eyes under beetle
brows and a face fashioned mostly of scars.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>At the Prosecution table on the right sat Prosecutor Holjance
Vohnbrook, a tall scarecrow of a man dressed in conviction red.
Gray hair topped a stern face as grim and forbidding as a latter
day Cotton Mather. Beside him sat a frightened appearing young aide
and Panthor Bolin, the Pan-Spechi complainant, his multi-faceted
eyes hidden beneath veined lids.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Are we joined for trial?' Dooley asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Both Oulson and Vohnbrook arose, nodded.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'If the court pleases,' Vohnbrook rumbled, 'I would like to
remind the Bureau of Sabotage personnel present that this court is
exempt from their ministrations.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'If the prosecutor trips over his own feet,' Oulson said, 'I
assure him it will be his own clumsiness and no act of mine nor of
my colleagues.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Vohnbrook's face darkened with a rush of blood. 'It's well known
how you ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A great drumming boomed through the courtarena as Dooley touched
the handle of his sword of office. The sound drowned the
prosecutor's words. When silence was restored, Dooley said: 'This
court will tolerate no displays of personality. I wish that
understood at the outset.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Oulson smiled, a look like a grimace in his scarred face. 'I
apologize, Your Honor,' he said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Dooley sank back into his chair, noting the gleam in Oulson's
eyes. It occurred to Dooley then that the defense attorney,
sabotage-trained, could have brought on the prosecutor's attack to
gain the court's sympathy.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The charge is outlaw sabotage in violation of this court's
injunction,' Dooley said. 'I understand that opening statements
have been waived by both sides, the public having been admitted to
causae in this matter by appropriate postings?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'So recorded,' intoned the robo-clerk.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Oulson leaned forward against the defense table, said: 'Your
Honor, defendant Jorj X. McKie has not accepted me as counsel and
wishes to argue for separate trial. I am here now representing only
the Bureau and Clinton Watt.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Who is appearing for defendant McKie?' the judge asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie, feeling like a man leaping over a precipice, got to his
feet, said: 'I wish to represent myself, Your Honor.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You should be cautioned against this course,' Dooley said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Set Oulson has advised me I have a fool for a client,' McKie
said. 'But in common with most Bureau agents, I have legal
training. I've been admitted to the System Bar and have practiced
under such codes as the Gowachin where the double-negative
innocence requirement must be satisfied before bringing criminal
accusation against the prosecutor and proceeding backward the
premise that ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'This is not Gowachin,' Judge Dooley said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'May I remind the Court,' Vohnbrook said, 'that defendant McKie
is a saboteur extraordinary. This goes beyond questions of
champerty. Every utterance this man ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The law's the same for official saboteurs as it is for others
in respect to the issue at hand,' Oulson said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Gentlemen!' the judge said. 'If you please? I will decide law
in this court.' He waited through a long moment of silence. 'The
behavior of all parties in this matter is receiving my most careful
attention.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie forced himself to radiate calm good humor.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Watt, whose profound knowledge of the saboteur extraordinary
made this pose a danger signal, tugged violently at the sleeve of
defense attorney Oulson. Oulson waved him away. Watt glowered at
McKie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'If the court permits,' McKie said, 'a joint defense on the
present charge would appear to violate ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The court is well aware that this case was bound over on the
basis of deposa summation through a ruling by a robo-legum,' Dooley
said. 'I warn both defense and prosecution, however, that I make my
own decisions in such matters. Law and robo-legum are both human
constructions and require human interpretation. And I will add
that, as far as I'm concerned, in all conflicts between human
agencies and machine agencies the human agencies are
paramount.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Is this a hearing or a trial?' McKie asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We will proceed as in trial, subject to the evidence as
presented.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie rested his palms on the edge of the defense table,
studying the judge. The saboteur felt a surge of misgiving. Dooley
was a no-nonsense customer. He had left himself a wide avenue
within the indictment. And this was a case that went far beyond
immediate danger to the Bureau of Sabotage. Far-reaching precedents
could be set here this day - or disaster could strike. Ignoring
instincts of self preservation, McKie wondered if he dared try
sabotage within the confines of the court.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The robo-legum indictment requires joint defense,' McKie said.
'I admit sabotage against Ser Clinton Watt, but remind the court of
Paragraph Four, section ninety-one, of the Semantic Revision to the
Constitution, wherein the Secretary of Sabotage is exempted from
all immunities. I move to quash the indictment as it regards
myself. I was at the time a legal officer of the Bureau required by
my duties to test the abilities of my superior.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Vohnbrook scowled at McKie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Mmmm,' Dooley said. He saw that the prosecutor had detected
where McKie's logic must lead. If McKie were legally dismissed from
the Bureau at the time of his conversation with the Pan-Spechi, the
prosecution's case might fall through.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Does the prosecutor wish to seek a conspiracy indictment?'
Dooley asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>For the first time since entering the courtarena, defense
attorney Oulson appeared agitated. He bent his scarred features
close to Watt's gorgon head, conferred in whispers with the
defendant. Oulson's face grew darker and darker as he whispered.
Watt's gorgon tendrils writhed in agitation.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We don't seek a conspiracy indictment at this time,' Vohnbrook
said. 'However, we would be willing to separate ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Your Honor!' Oulson said, surging to his feet. 'Defense must
protest separation of indictments at this time. It's our contention
that &#8230;'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Court cautions both counsel in this matter that this is not a
Gowachin jurisdiction,' Dooley said in an angry voice. 'We don't
have to convict the defender and exonerate the prosecutor before
trying a case. However, if either of you would wish a change of
venue ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Vohnbrook, a smug expression on his lean face, bowed to the
judge. 'Your Honor,' he said, 'we wish at this time to request
removal of defendant McKie from the indictment and ask that he be
held as a prosecution witness.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Objection!' Oulson shouted. 'Prosecution well knows it cannot
hold a key witness under trumped up ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Overruled,' Dooley said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Exception!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Noted.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Dooley waited as Oulson sank into his chair. This is a day to
remember, the judge thought. Sabotage itself outfoxed! Then he
noted the glint of sly humor in the eyes of saboteur extraordinary
McKie, realizing with an abrupt sense of caution that McKie too had
manoeuvered for this position.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Prosecution may call its first witness,' the judge said, and he
punched a code signal that sent a robo-aide to escort McKie away
from the defense table and into a holding box.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A look of almost pleasure came over prosecutor Vohnbrook's
cadaverous face. He rubbed one of his downdrooping eyelids, said:
'Call Panthor Bolin.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The Achusian capitalist got to his feet, strode to the witness
ring. The robo-clerk's screen flashed for the record: 'Panthor 
Bolin of Achus IV, certified witness in this System High
Court.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The oath of sincerity having been administered, Panther Bolin
is prepared for testifying,' the robo-clerk reelslated.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Panthor Bolin, are you chief officer of the civil organization
known as the Tax Watchers?' Vohnbrook asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I ... ah ... y-yes' Bolin faltered. He passed a large blue
handkerchief across his forehead, staring sharply at McKie.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>He just now realizes what it is I must do,</EM> McKie
thought.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I show you this recording from the robo-legum indictment
proceedings,' Vohnbrook said. 'It is certified by System police as
being a conversation between yourself and Jorj X. McKie in which
...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Your Honor!' Oulson objected. 'Both witnesses to this alleged
conversation are present in this courtarena. There are more direct
ways to bring out any pertinent information from this matter.
Further, since the clear threat of a conspiracy charge remains in
this case, I object to introducing this recording as forcing a man
to testify against himself.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ser McKie is no longer on trial here and Ser Oulson is not
McKie's attorney of record,' Vohnbrook gloated.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The objection does, however, have some merit,' Dooley said. He
looked at McKie seated in the holding box.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'There's nothing shameful about that conversation with Ser
Bolin,' McKie said. 'I've no objection to introducing this record
of the conversation.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Bolin rose up on his toes, made as though to speak, sank
back.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Now he is certain,</EM> McKie thought.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Then I will admit this record subject to judicial deletions,'
Dooley said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Clinton Watt, seated at the defense table, buried his gorgon
head in his arms.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Vohnbrook, a death's-head grin on his long face, said: 'Ser
Bolin, I show you this recording. Now, in this conversation, was
Sabotage Agent McKie subjected to any form of coercion?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Objection!' Oulson roared, surging to his feet. His scarred
face was a scowling mask. 'At the time of this alleged recording,
Ser McKie was not an agent of the Bureau!' He looked at Vohnbrook.
'Defense objects to the prosecutor's obvious effort to link Ser
McKie with ...'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>'Alleged</EM> conversation!' Vohnbrook snarled. 'Ser McKie
himself admits the exchange!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>In a weary voice, Dooley said: 'Objection sustained. Unless
tangible evidence of conspiracy is introduced here, references to
Ser McKie as an agent of Sabotage will not be admitted here.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But, Your Honor,' Vohnbrook protested, 'Ser McKie's own actions
preclude any other interpretation!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I've ruled on this point,' Dooley said 'Proceed.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie got to his feet in the holding box, said: 'Would Your 
Honor permit me to act as a friend of the Court here?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Dooley leaned back, hand on chin, turning the question over in
his mind. A general feeling of uneasiness about the case was
increasing in him and he couldn't pinpoint it. McKie's every action
appeared suspect. Dooley reminded himself that the saboteur
extraordinary was notorious for sly plots, for devious and
convoluted schemes of the wildest and most improbable inversions -
like onion layers in a five dimensional klein-shape. The man's
success in practicing under the Gowachin legal code could be
understood.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You may explain what you have in mind,' Dooley said, 'but I'm
not yet ready to admit your statements into the record.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The Bureau of Sabotage's own Code would clarify matters,' McKie
said, realizing that these words burned his bridges behind him. 'My
action in successfully sabotaging <EM>acting</EM> Secretary Watt is
a matter of record.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie pointed to the gorgon mass visible as Watt lifted his head
and glared across the room.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>'Acting</EM> Secretary?' the judge asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'So it must be presumed,' McKie said. 'Under the Bureau's Code,
once the Secretary is sabotaged he ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Your Honor!' Oulson shouted. 'We are in danger of breach of
security here! I understand these proceedings are being
broadcast!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'As Director-in-Limbo of the Bureau of Sabotage, I will decide
what is a breach of security and what isn't!' McKie snapped.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Watt returned his head to his arms, groaned.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Oulson sputtered.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Dooley stared at McKie in shock.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Vohnbrook broke the spell. The prosecutor said: 'Your Honor,
this man has not been sworn to sincerity. I suggest we excuse Ser
Bolin for the time being and have Ser McKie continue his
<EM>explanation</EM> under oath.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Dooley took a deep breath, said: 'Does defense have any
questions of Ser Bolin at this time?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Not at this time,' Oulson muttered. 'I presume he's subject to
recall?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'He is,' Dooley said, turning to McKie. 'Take the witness ring,
Ser McKie.'</P>
<P> </P>

<P> </P>
<P class="c1"><STRONG>Chapter IV</STRONG></P>
<P> </P>
<P>Bolin, moving like a sleepwalker, stepped out of the ring,
returned to the prosecution table. The Pan-Spechi's multifaceted
eyes reflected an odd glitter, moving with a trapped sense of
evasiveness. McKie entered the ring, took the oath and faced
Vohnbrook, composing his features in a look of purposeful
decisiveness that he knew his actions must reflect.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You called yourself Director-in-Limbo of the Bureau of
Sabotage,' Vohnbrook said. 'Would you explain that, please?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Before McKie could answer, Watt lifted his head from his arms,
growled: 'You traitor, McKie!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Dooley grabbed the pommel of his sword of justice to indicate an
absolute position and barked: 'I will tolerate no outbursts in my
courts!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Oulson put a hand on Watt's shoulder. Both of them glared at
McKie. The medusa tendrils of Watt's head writhed as they ranged
through the rainbow spectrum.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I caution the witness,' Dooley said, 'that his remarks would
appear to admit a conspiracy. Anything he says now may be used
against him.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'No conspiracy, Your Honor,' McKie said. He faced Vohnbrook, but
appeared to be addressing Watt. 'Over the centuries, the function
of Sabotage in the government has grown more and more open, but
certain aspects of changing the guard, so to speak, have been held
as a highly placed secret. The rule is that if a man can protect
himself from sabotage he's fit to boss Sabotage. Once sabotaged,
however, the Bureau's Secretary must resign and submit his position
to the President and the full Cabinet.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'He's out?' Dooley asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Not necessarily,' McKie said. 'If the act of sabotage against
the Secretary is profound enough, subtle enough, carries enough far
reaching effects, the Secretary is replaced by the successful
saboteur. He is, indeed, out.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Then it's now up to the President and the Cabinet to decide
between Ser Watt and yourself, is that what you're saying?' Dooley
asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Me?' McKie asked. 'No, I'm Director-in-Limbo because I
accomplished a successful act of sabotage against Ser Watt and
because I happen to be senior saboteur extraordinary on duty.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But it's alleged that you were fired,' Vohnbrook objected.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'A formality,' McKie said. 'It's customary to fire the saboteur
who's successful in such an effort. This makes him eligible for
appointment as Secretary if he so aspires. However, I have no such
ambition at this time.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Watt jerked upright, staring at McKie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie ran a finger around his collar, realizing the physical
peril he was about to face. A glance at the Pan-Spechi confirmed
the feeling. Panthor Bolin was holding himself in check by a
visible effort.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'This is all very interesting,' Vohnbrook sneered, 'but how can
it possibly have any bearing on the present action? The charge here
is outlaw sabotage against the Tax Watchers represented by the
person of Ser Panthor Bolin. If Ser McKie ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'If the distinguished Prosecutor will permit me,' McKie said, 'I
believe I can set his fears at rest. It should be obvious to -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'There's conspiracy here!' Vohnbrook shouted. 'What about the
...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A loud pounding interrupted him as Judge Dooley lifted his
sword, its theremin effect filling the room. When silence had been
restored, the judge lowered his sword, replaced it firmly on the
ledge in front of him.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Dooley took a moment to calm himself. He sensed now the delicate
political edge he walked and thanked his stars that he had left the
door open to rule that the present session was a hearing.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We will now proceed in an orderly fashion,' Dooley said.
'That's one of the things courts are for, you know.' He took a deep
breath. 'Now, there are several people present whose dedication to
the maintenance of law and order should be beyond question. I'd
think that among those we should number Ser Prosecutor Vohnbrook;
the distinguished defense counsel, Ser Oulson: Ser Bolin, whose
race is noted for its reasonableness and humanity; and the
distinguished representatives of the Bureau of Sabotage, whose
actions may at times annoy and anger us, but who are, we know,
consecrated to the principle of strengthening us and exposing our
inner resources.'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>This judge missed his calling,</EM> McKie thought. <EM>With
speeches like that, he could get into the Legislative
branch.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>Abashed, Vohnbrook sank back into his chair.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Now,' the judge said, 'unless I'm mistaken, Ser McKie has
referred to two acts of sabotage.' Dooley glanced down at McKie.
'Ser McKie?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'So it would appear. Your Honor,' McKie said, hoping he read the
judge's present attitude correctly. 'However, this court may be in
a unique position to rule on that very question. You see, Your
Honor, the alleged act of sabotage to which I refer was initiated
by a Pan-Spechi agent of the Bureau. Now, though, the secondary
benefits of that action appear to be sought after by a cr&#232;che
mate of that agent, whose ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You dare suggest that I'm not the holder of my cell's ego?'
Bolin demanded.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Without knowing quite where it was or what it was, McKie was
aware that a weapon had been trained on him by the Pan-Spechi.
References in their culture to the weapon for defense of the ego
were clear enough.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I make no such suggestion,' McKie said, speaking hastily and
with as much sincerity as he could put into his voice. 'But surely
you cannot have misinterpreted the terranic-human culture so much
that you do not know what will happen now.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Warned by some instinct, the judge and other spectators to this
interchange remained silent.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Bolin appeared to be trembling in every cell of his body. 'I am
distressed,' he muttered.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'If there were a way to achieve the necessary rapport and avoid
that distress I would have taken it,' McKie said. 'Can you see
another way?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Still trembling, Bolin said: 'I must do what I must do.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>In a low voice, Dooley said: 'Ser McKie, just what is going on
here?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Two cultures are, at last, attempting to understand each
other,' McKie said. 'We've lived together in apparent understanding
for centuries, but appearances can be deceptive.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Oulson started to rise, was pulled back by Watt.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>And McKie noted that his former Bureau chief had assessed the
peril here. It was a point in Watt's favor.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You understand, Ser Bolin,' McKie said, watching the Pan-Spechi
carefully, 'that these things must be brought into the open and
discussed carefully before a decision can be reached in this court.
It's a rule of law to which you've submitted. I'm inclined to favor
your bid for the Secretariat, but my own decision awaits the
outcome of this hearing.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What things must be discussed?' Dooley demanded. 'And what
gives you the right, Ser McKie, to call this a hearing?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'A figure of speech,' McKie said, but he kept his attention on
the Pan-Spechi, wondering what the terrible weapon was that the
race used in defense of its egos. 'What do you say, Ser Bolin?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You protect the sanctity of your home life,' Bolin said. 'Do
you deny me the same right?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Sanctity, not secrecy,' McKie said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Dooley looked from McKie to Bolin, noted the compressed-spring
look of the Pan-Spechi, the way he kept a hand hidden in a jacket
pocket. It occurred to the judge then that the Pan-Spechi might
have a weapon ready to use against others in this court. Bolin had
that look about him. Dooley hesitated on the point of calling
guards, reviewed what he knew of the Pan-Spechi. He decided not to
cause a crisis. The Pan-Spechi were admitted to the concourse of
humanity, good friends but terrible enemies, and there were always
those allusions to their hidden powers, to their ego jealousies, to
the fierceness with which they defended the secrecy of their
cr&#232;ches.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Slowly Bolin overcame the trembling. 'Say what you feel you
must,' he growled.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie said a silent prayer of hope that the Pan-Spechi could
control his reflexes, addressed himself to the nexus of pickups on
the far wall that was recording this courtarena scene for broadcast
to the entire universe.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'A Pan-Spechi who took the name of Napoleon Bildoon was one of
the leading agents in the Bureau of Sabotage,' McKie said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Agent Bildoon dropped from sight at the time Panthor Bolin took
over as chief of the Tax Watchers. It's highly probable that the
Tax Watcher organization is an elaborate and subtle sabotage of the
Bureau of Sabotage itself, a move originated by Bildoon.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'There is no such person as Bildoon!' Bolin cried.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ser McKie,' Judge Dooley said, 'would you care to continue this
interchange in the privacy of my chambers?' The judge stared down
at the saboteur, trying to appear kindly but firm.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Your Honor,' McKie said, 'may we out of respect for a fellow
human, leave that decision to Ser Bolin?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Bolin turned his multi-faceted eyes toward the bench, spoke in a
low voice: 'If the court please, it were best this were done
openly.' He jerked his hand from his pocket. It came out empty. He
leaned across the table, gripped the far edge. 'Continue, if you
please, Ser.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie swallowed, momentarily overcome with admiration for the
Pan-Spechi. 'It will be a distinct pleasure to serve under you, Ser
Bolin,' McKie said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Do what you must!' Bolin rasped.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie looked from the wonderment in the faces of Watt and the
attorneys up to the questioning eyes of Judge Dooley. 'In
Pan-Spechi parlance, there is no person called Bildoon. But there
was such a person, a group mate of Ser Bolin. I hope you notice the
similarity in the names they chose for themselves?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ah ... yes,' Dooley said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm afraid I've been somewhat of a nosey Parker, a peeping Tom
and several other categories of snoop where the Pan-Spechi are
concerned,' McKie said. 'But it was because I suspected the act of
sabotage to which I've referred here. The Tax Watchers revealed too
much inside knowledge of the Bureau of Sabotage.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I ... ah ... am not quite sure I understand you,' Dooley
said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The best kept secret in the universe, the Pan-Spechi cyclic
change of gender and identity, is no longer a secret where I'm
concerned,' McKie said. He swallowed as he saw Bolin's fingers go
white where they tightly gripped the prosecution table.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It relates to the issue at hand?' Dooley asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Most definitely, Your Honor,' McKie said. 'You see, the
Pan-Spechi have a unique gland that controls mentation, dominance,
the relationship between reason and instinct. The five group mates
are, in reality, one person. I wish to make that clear for reasons
of legal necessity.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Legal necessity?' Dooley asked. He glanced down at the
obviously distressed Bolin, back to McKie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The gland, when it's functioning, confers ego dominance on the
Pan-Spechi in whom it functions. But it functions for a time that's
definitely limited - twenty-five to thirty years.' McKie looked at
Bolin. Again, the Pan-Spechi was trembling. 'Please understand, Ser
Bolin,' he said, 'that I do this out of necessity and that this is
not an act of sabotage.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Bolin lifted his face toward McKie. The Pan-Spechi's features
appeared contorted in grief. 'Get it over with, man!' he
rasped.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes,' McKie said, turning back to the judge's puzzled face.
'Ego transfer in the Pan-Spechi, Your Honor, involves a transfer of
what may be termed basic-experience-learning. It's accomplished
through physical contractor when the ego holder dies, no matter how
far he may be separated from the cr&#232;che, this seems to fire up
the eldest of the cr&#232;che triplets. The ego-single also
bequeaths a verbal legacy to his mate whenever possible - and
that's most of the time. Specifically, it's this time.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Dooley leaned back. He was beginning to see the legal question
McKie's account had posed.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The act of sabotage which might make a Pan-Spechi eligible for
appointment as Secretary of the Bureau of Sabotage was initiated by
a ... ah ... cell mate of the Ser Bolin in court today, is that
it?' Dooley asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie wiped his brow. 'Correct, Your Honor.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But that cell mate is no longer the ego dominant, eh?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Quite right, Your Honor!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The ... ah ... former ego holder, this ... ah ... Bildoon, is
no longer eligible?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Bildoon, or what was once Bildoon, is a creature operating
solely on instinct now, Your Honor,' McKie said. 'Capable of acting
as cr&#232;che nurse for a time and, eventually, fulfilling another
destiny I'd rather not explain.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I see.' Dooley looked at the weather cover of the court arena.
He was beginning to see what McKie had risked here. 'And you favor
this, ah, Ser Bolin's bid for the Secretariat?' Dooley asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'If President Bindley and the Cabinet follow the recommendation
of the Bureau's senior agents, the procedure always followed in the
past, Ser Bolin will be the new Secretary,' McKie said. 'I favor
this.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Why?' Dooley asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Because of this unique roving ego, the Pan-Spechi have a more
communal attitude toward fellow sentients than do most other
species admitted to the concourse of humanity,' McKie said. 'This
translates as a sense of responsibility toward all life. They're
not necessarily maudlin about it. They oppose where it's necessary
to build strength. Their cr&#232;che life demonstrates several
clear examples of this which I'd prefer not to describe.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I see,' Dooley said, but he had to admit to himself that he did
not. McKie's allusions to unspeakable practices were beginning to
annoy him. 'And you feel that this Bildoon-Bolin act of sabotage
qualifies him, provided this court rules they are one and the same
person?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We're not the same person!' Bolin cried. 'You don't dare say
that ... that shambling, clinging &#8230;'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Easy,' McKie said. 'Ser Bolin, I'm sure you see the need for
this legal fiction.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Legal fiction,' Bolin said as though clinging to the words. The
multi-faceted eyes glared across the courtarena at McKie. 'Thank
you for the verbal nicety, McKie.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You've not answered my question, Ser McKie,' Dooley said,
ignoring the exchange with Bolin.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Sabotaging Ser Watt through an attack on the entire Bureau
contains subtlety and finesse never before achieved in such an
effort,' McKie said. 'The entire Bureau will be strengthened by
it.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie glanced at Watt. The acting Secretary's medusa tangle had
ceased its writhing. He was staring at Bolin with a speculative
look in his eyes. Sensing the quiet in the court-arena, he glanced
up at McKie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Don't you agree, Ser Watt?' McKie asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh, yes. Quite,' Watt said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The note of sincerity in Watt's voice startled the judge. For
the first time, he wondered at the dedication which these men
brought to their jobs.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Sabotage is a very sensitive Bureau,' Dooley said. 'I've some
serious reservations -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'If Your Honor please,' McKie said, 'forbearance is one of the
chief attributes a saboteur can bring to his duties. Now, I wish
you to understand what our Pan-Spechi friend has done here this
day. Let us suppose that I had spied upon the most intimate moments
between you, Judge, and your wife, and that I reported them in
detail here in open court with half the universe looking on. Let us
suppose further that you had the strictest moral code against such
discussions with outsiders. Let us suppose that I made these
disclosures in the basest terms with every four-letter word at my
command. Let us suppose that you were armed, traditionally, with a
deadly weapon to strike at such blasphemers, such -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Filth!' Bolin grated.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes,' McKie said. 'Filth. Do you suppose, Your Honor, that you
could have stood by without killing me?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Good heavens!' Dooley said.</P>

<P class="c1"><STRONG>Chapter V</STRONG></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ser Bolin,' McKie said, 'I offer you and all your race my most
humble apologies.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'd hoped once to undergo the ordeal in the privacy of a
judge's chambers with as few outsiders as possible,' Bolin said.
'But once you were started in open court ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It had to be this way,' McKie said. 'If we'd done it in
private, people would've come to be suspicious about a Pan-Spechi
in control of ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'People?' Bolin asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Non Pan-Spechi,' McKie said. 'It'd have been a barrier between
our species.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And we've been strengthened by all this,' McKie said. 'Those
provisions of the Constitution that provide the people with a
slowly moving government have been demonstrated anew. We've
admitted the public to the inner workings of Sabotage, shown them
the valuable character of the man who'll be the new Secretary.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I've not yet ruled on the critical issue here,' Dooley
said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But Your Honor!' McKie said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'With all due respect to you as a saboteur extraordinary, Ser
McKie,' Dooley said, 'I'll make my decision on evidence gathered
under my direction.' He looked at Bolin. 'Ser Bolin, would you
permit an agent of this court to gather such evidence as will allow
me to render verdict without fear of harming my own species?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We're humans together,' Bolin growled.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But terranic humans hold the balance of power,' Dooley said. 'I
owe allegiance to law, yes, but my terranic fellows depend on me,
too. I have a ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You wish your own agents to determine if Ser McKie has told the
truth about us?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ah ... yes,' Dooley said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Bolin looked at McKie. 'Ser McKie, it is I who apologize to you.
I had not realized how deeply xenophobia penetrated your
fellows.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Because,' McKie said, 'outside of your natural modesty, you
have no such fear. I suspect you know the phenomenon only through
reading of us.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But all strangers are potential sharers of identity,' Bolin
said. 'Ah, well.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'If you're through with your little chat,' Dooley said, 'would
you care to answer my question, Ser Bolin? This is still I hope, a
court of law.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Tell me, Your Honor,' Bolin said, 'would you permit me to
witness the tenderest intimacies between you and your wife?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Dooley's face darkened, but he saw suddenly in all of its stark
detail the extent of McKie's analogy and it was to the judge's
credit that he rose to the occasion. 'If it were necessary to
promote understanding,' he rasped, 'yes!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I believe you would,' Bolin murmured. He took a deep breath.
'After what I've been through here today, one more sacrifice can be
borne, I guess. I grant your investigators the privilege requested,
but advise that they be discreet.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It will strengthen you for the trials ahead as Secretary of the
Bureau,' McKie said. 'The Secretary, you must bear in mind, has no
immunities from sabotage whatsoever.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But,' Bolin said, 'the Secretary's legal orders carrying out
his Constitutional functions must be obeyed by all agents.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>McKie nodded, seeing in the glitter of Bolin's eyes, a vista of
peeping Tom assignments with endless detailed reports to the
Secretary of Sabotage - at least until the fellow's curiosity had
been satisfied and his need for revenge satiated.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>But the others in the court-room, not having McKie's insight,
merely wondered at the question: <EM>What did he really mean by
that?</EM></P>

<P>He was too old for this kind of work even if his name was Ivar
Norris Gump, admittedly the best troubleshooter in the company's
nine-hundred-year history. If it'd been anyone but his old friend
Poss Washington calling for help, there'd have been a polite
refusal signed "Ing." Semi-retirement gave a troubleshooter the
right to turn down dangerous assignments.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Now, after three hours on duty in a full vac suit within a
Skoarnoff tube's blank darkness, Ing ached with tiredness. It
impaired his mental clarity and his ability to survive and he knew
it.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>You will take your work seriously at all times,</EM> he
thought. <EM>Axiom: A troubleshooter shall not get into</EM>
<EM>trouble.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing shook his head at the handbook's educated ignorance, took a
deep breath and tried to relax. Right now he should be back home on
Mars, his only concerns the routine maintenance of the Phobos Relay
and an occasional lecture to new 'shooters.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Damn that Poss,</EM> he thought.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The big trouble was in here, though-in the tube, and six good
men had died trying to find it. They were six men he had helped
train-and that was another reason he had come. They were all caught
up in the same dream.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Around Ing stretched an airless tubular cave twelve kilometers
long, two kilometers diameter. It was a lightless hole carved
through lava rock beneath the moon's Mare Nectaris. Here was the
home of the "Beam"-the beautiful, deadly, vitally <EM>serious</EM>
beam, a tamed violence which suddenly had become balky.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing thought of all the history which had gone into this tube.
Some nine hundred years ago the Seedling Compact had been signed.
In addition to its Solar System Communications duties, the Haigh
Company had taken over then the sending out of small containers,
their size severely limited by the mass an angtrans pulse could
push. Each container held twenty female rabbits. In the rabbit
uteri, dormant, their metabolism almost at a standstill, lay two
hundred human embryos nestled with embryos of cattle, all the
domestic stock needed to start a new human economy. With the
rabbits went plant seeds, insect eggs and design tapes for
tools.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The containers were rigged to fold out on a planet's surface to
provide a shielded living area. There the embryos would be
machine-transferred into inflatable gestation vats, brought to full
term, cared for and educated by mechanicals until the human
<EM>seed</EM> could fend for itself.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Each container had been pushed to trans-light speed by angtrans
pulses-" "Like pumping a common garden swing," said the popular
literature. The life mechanism was controlled by signals
transmitted through the "Beam" whose tiny impulses went "around the
corner" to bridge in milliseconds distances which took matter
centuries to traverse.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing glanced up at the miniature beam sealed behind its quartz
window in his suit. There was the hope and the frustration. If they
could only put a little beam such as that in each container, the
big beam could home on it. But under that harsh bombardment, beam
anodes lasted no longer than a month. They made-do with reflection
plates on the containers, then, with beam-bounce and programmed
approximations. And somewhere the programmed approximations were
breaking down.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Now, with the first Seedling Compact vessel about to land on
Theta Apus IV, with mankind's interest raised to fever pitch-beam
contact had turned unreliable. The farther out the container, the
worse the contact.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing could feel himself being drawn toward that frail cargo out
there. His instincts were in communion with those containers which
would drift into limbo unless the beam was brought under control.
The embryos would surely die eventually and the dream would die
with them.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Much of humanity feared the containers had fallen into the hands
of alien life, that the human embryos were being taken over by
something <EM>out there.</EM> Panic ruled in some quarters and
there were shouts that the SC containers betrayed enough human
secrets to make the entire race vulnerable.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>To Ing and the six before him, the locus of the problem seemed
obvious. It lay in here and in the anomaly math newly derived to
explain how the beam might be deflected from the containers. What
to do about that appeared equally obvious. But six men had died
following that obvious course. They had died here in this utter
blackness.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Sometimes it helped to quote the book.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Often you didn't know what you hunted here-a bit of stray
radiation perhaps, a few cosmic rays that had penetrated a weak
spot in the force-baffle shielding, a dust leak caused by a
moonquake, or a touch of heat, a hot spot coming up from the
depths. The big beam wouldn't tolerate much interference. Put a
pinhead flake of dust in its path at the wrong moment, let a tiny
flicker of light intersect it, and it went whiplash wild. It
writhed like a giant snake, tore whole sections off the tube walls.
Beam auroras danced in the sky above the moon then and the human
attendants scurried.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A troubleshooter at the wrong spot in the tube died.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing pulled his hands into his suit's barrel top, adjusted his
own tiny beam scope, the unit that linked him through a short reach
of angspace to beam control. He checked his instruments, read his
position from the modulated contact ripple through the soles of his
shielded suit.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He wondered what his daughter, Lisa, was doing about now.
Probably getting the boys, his grandsons, ready for the slotride to
school. It made Ing feel suddenly old to think that one of his
grandsons already was in Mars Polytechnic aiming for a Haigh
Company career in the footsteps of his famous grandfather.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The vac suit was hot and smelly around Ing after a three-hour
tour. He noted from a dial that his canned-cold temperature balance
system still had an hour and ten minutes before red-line.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>It's the cleaners,</EM> Ing told himself. <EM>It has to be
the vacuum cleaners. It's the old familiar cussedness of inanimate
objects.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>What did the handbook say? <EM>"Frequently it pays to</EM>
<EM>look first for the characteristics of devices in use which</EM>
<EM>may be such that an essential pragmatic approach</EM>
<EM>offers the best chance for success. It often is possible
to</EM> <EM>solve an accident or malfunction problem with</EM>
<EM>straightforward and uncomplicated approaches,
delib&#173;</EM><EM>erately ignoring their more subtle
aspects.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>He slipped his hands back into his suit's arms, shielded his
particle counter with an armored hand, cracked open the cover,
peered in at the luminous dial. Immediately, an angry voice
crackled in the speakers:</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Douse that light! We're beaming!"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing snapped the lid closed by reflex, said: "I'm in the
backboard shadow. Can't see the beam." Then: "Why wasn't I told
you're beaming?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Another voice rumbled from the speakers: "It's Poss here, Ing.
I'm monitoring your position by sono, told them to go ahead without
disturbing you."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"What's the supetrans doing monitoring a troubleshooter?" Ing
asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"All right, Ing."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing chuckled, then: "What're you doing, testing?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Yes. We've an inner-space transport to beam down on Titan,
thought we'd run it from here."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Did I foul the beam?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"We're still tracking clean."</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Inner-space transmission open and reliable,</EM> Ing
thought, <EM>but the long reach out to the stars was</EM>
<EM>muddied.</EM> Maybe the scare mongers were right. Maybe it was
outside interference, an alien intelligence.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"We've lost two cleaners on this transmission," Washington said.
"Any sign of them?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Negative."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>They'd lost two cleaners on the transmission, Ing thought. That
was getting to be routine. The flitting vacuum cleaners-supported
by the beam's field, patrolling its length for the slightest trace
of interfer&#173;ence, had to be replaced at the rate of about a
hundred a year normally, but the rate had been going up. As the
beam grew bigger, unleashed more power for the long reach, the
cleaners proved less and less effective at dodging the angtrans
throw, the controlled whiplash. No part of a cleaner survived
contact with the beam. They were energy-charged in phase with the
beam, keyed for instant dissolution to add their energy to the
transmission.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"It's the damned cleaners," Ing said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"That's what you all keep saying," Washington said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing began prowling to his right. Somewhere off there the
glassite floor curved gradually upward and became a wall-and then a
ceiling. But the opposite side was always two kilometers away, and
the moon's gravity, light as that was, imposed limits on how far he
could walk up the wall. It wasn't like the little Phobos beam where
they could use a low-power magnafield outside and walk right around
the tube.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He wondered then if he was going to insist on riding one of the
cleaners... the way the six others had done.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing's shuffling, cautious footsteps brought him out of the anode
backboard's shadow. He turned, saw a pencil line of glowing purple
stretching away from him to the cathode twelve kilometers distant.
He knew there actually was no purple glow, that what he saw was a
visual simulation created on the one-way surface of his faceplate,
a reaction to the beam's presence displayed there for his benefit
alone.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Washington's voice in his speaker said: "Sono has you in Zone
Yellow. Take it easy, Ing."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing altered course to the right, studied the beam.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Intermittent breaks in the purple line betrayed the presence
between himself and that lambent energy of the robot vacuum
cleaners policing the perimeter, hanging on the sine lines of the
beam field like porpoises gamboling on a bow wave.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Transport's down," Washington said. "We're phasing into a
long-throw test. Ten-minute program."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing nodded to himself, imagined Washington sitting there in the
armored bubble of the control room, a giant, with a brooding face,
eyes alert and glittering. Old Poss didn't want to believe it was
the cleaners, that was sure. If it was the cleaners, someone was
going to have to ride the wild goose. There'd be more deaths...
more rides... until they tested out the new theory. It certainly
was a helluva time for someone to come up with an anomaly
<EM>hole</EM> in the angtrans math. But that's what someone back at
one of the trans-time computers on Earth had done... and if he was
right-&#173;then the problem had to be the cleaners.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing studied the shadow breaks in the beam-robotic torpedoes,
sensor-trained to collect the tiniest debris. One of the shadows
suddenly reached away from him in both directions until the entire
beam was hidden. A cleaner was approaching him. Ing waited for it
to identify the Authorized Intruder markings which it could
<EM>see</EM> the same way he saw the beam.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The beam reappeared.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Cleaner just looked you over," Washington said. "You're getting
in pretty close."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing heard the worry in his friend's voice, said: "I'm all right
long's I stay up here close to the board."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He tried to picture in his mind then the cleaner lifting over
him and returning to its station along the beam.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"I'm plotting you against the beam," Washington said. "Your
shadow width says you're approaching Zone Red. Don't crowd it, Ing.
I'd rather not have to clean a fried troubleshooter out of
there."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Hate to put you to all that extra work," Ing said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Give yourself plenty of 'lash room."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"I'm miking the beam thickness against my helmet cross-hairs,
Poss. Relax."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing advanced another two steps, sent his gaze traversing the
beam's length, seeking the beginnings of the controlled whiplash
which would <EM>throw</EM> the test message into angspace. The
chained energy of the purple rope began to bend near its center far
down the tube. It was an action visible only as a gentle flickering
outward against the cross-hairs of his faceplate.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He backed off four steps. The throw was a chancy thing when you
were this close-and if interfering radiation ever touched that
beam...</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing crouched, sighted along the beam, waited for the throw. An
experienced troubleshooter could tell more from the way the beam
whipped than banks of instruments could reveal. Did it push out a
double bow? Look for faulty field focus. Did it waver up and down?
Possible misalignment of vertical hold. Did it split or spread into
two loops? Synchronization problem.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>But you had to be in here close and alert to that fractional
margin between good seeing and <EM>goodnight!</EM> forever.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Cleaners began paying more attention to him in this close, but
he planted himself with his AI markings visible to them, allowing
them to fix his position and go on about their business.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>To Ing's trained eye, the cleaner action appeared more intense,
faster than normal. That agreed with all the previous
reports-unless a perimeter gap had admitted stray foreign
particles, or perhaps tiny shades dislodged from the tube's walls
by the pulse of the moon's own life.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing wondered then if there could be an overlooked hole in the
fanatic quadruple-lock controls giving access to the tube. But
they'd been sniffing along that line since the first sign of
trouble. Not likely a hole would've escaped the inspectors. No-it
was in here. And cleaner action <EM>was</EM> increased, a definite
lift in tempo.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Program condition?" Ing asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Transmission's still Whorf positive, but we haven't found an
angspace opening yet."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Time?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Eight minutes to program termination."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Cleaner action's way up," Ing said. "What's the dirt
count?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A pause, then: "Normal."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing shook his head. The monitor that kept constant count of the
quantity of debris picked up by the cleaners shouldn't show normal
in the face of this much activity.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"What's the word from Mare Nubium transmitter?" Ing asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Still shut down and full of inspection equipment. Nothing to
show for it at last report."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Imbrium?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Inspection teams are out and they expect to be back into test
phase by 0900. You're not thinking of ordering <EM>us</EM> to shut
down for a complete clean-out?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Not yet."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"We've got a budget to consider, too, Ing. Remem&#173;ber
that."</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Huh!</EM> Ing thought. <EM>Not like Poss to worry about</EM>
<EM>budget in this kind of an emergency. He trying to tell</EM>
<EM>me something?</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>What did the handbook say? <EM>"The good trouble-shooter is cost
conscious, aware that down time and</EM> <EM>equipment replacement
are factors of serious concern</EM> <EM>to the Haigh
Company."</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing wondered then if he should order the tube opened for
thorough inspection. But the Imbrium and Nubium tubes had revealed
nothing and the decontam&#173;ination time <EM>was</EM> costly.
They were the older tubes, though-Nubium the first to be built.
They were smaller than Nectaris, simpler locks. But their beams
weren't getting through any better than the Nectaris tube with its
behemoth size, greater safeguards.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Stand by," Washington said. "We're beginning to get whipcount
on the program."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>In the abrupt silence, Ing saw the beam curl. The whiplash came
down the twelve kilometers of tube curling like a purple wave,
traveling the entire length in about two thousandths of a second.
It was a thing so fast that the visual effect was of seeing it
<EM>after</EM> it had happened.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing stood up, began analyzing what he had seen. The beam had
appeared clean, pure-a perfect throw... except for one little flare
near the far end and another about midway. Little flares. The
afterimage was needle shaped, rigid... pointed.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"How'd it look?" Washington asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Clean," Ing said. "Did we get through?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"We're checking," Washington said, then: "Limited contact. Very
muddy. About thirty per cent...just about enough to tell us the
container's still there and its contents seem to be alive."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Is it in orbit?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>''Seems to be. Can't be sure."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Give me the cleaner count," Ing said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A pause, then: "Damnation! We're down another two."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Exactly two?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Yes. Why?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Dunno yet. Do your instruments show beam deflections from
hitting two cleaners? What's the energy sum?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Everyone thinks the cleaners are causing this," Washington
muttered. "I tell you they couldn't. They're fully phased
<EM>with</EM> the beam, just add energy to it if they hit. They're
<EM>not</EM> debris!"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"But does the beam really eat them?" Ing asked. "You saw the
anomaly report."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Oh, Ing, let's not go into that again." Washington's voice
sounded tired, irritated.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The stubborness of Washington's response confused Ing. This
wasn't like the man at all. "Sure," Ing said, "but what if they're
going somewhere we can't see?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Come off that, Ing! You're as bad as all the others. If there's
one place we know they're <EM>not</EM> going, that's into angspace.
There isn't enough energy in the universe to put cleaner mass
around the corner."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Unless that hole in our theories really exists," Ing said. And
he thought: <EM>Poss is trying to tell me</EM> <EM>something. What?
Why can't he come right out and say</EM> <EM>it?</EM> He waited,
wondering at an idea that nibbled at the edge of his mind-a
concept... What was it? Some half-forgotten association...</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Here's the beam report," Washington said. "De&#173;flection
shows only one being taken, but the energy sum's doubled all right.
One balanced out the other. That happens."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing studied the purple line, nodding to himself. The beam was
almost the color of a scarf his wife had worn on their honeymoon.
She'd been a good wife, Jennie-raising Lisa in Marsxamps and
blister pods, sticking with her man until the canned air and hard
life had taken her.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The beam lay quiescent now with only the faintest auroral bleed
off. Cleaner tempo was down. The test program still had a few
minutes to go, but Ing doubted it'd produce another throw into
angspace. You acquired an instinct for the transmission pulse after
a while. You could sense when the beam was going to open its tiny
signal window across the light-years.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"I saw both of those cleaners go," Ing said. "They didn't seem
to be torn apart or anything-just flared out."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Energy consumed," Washington said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Maybe."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing thought for a moment. A hunch was beginning to grow in him.
He knew a way to test it. The question was: Would Poss go along
with it? Hard to tell in his present mood. Ing wondered about his
friend. Darkness, the isolation of this position within the tube
gave voices from outside a disembodied quality.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Poss, do me a favor," Ing said. "Give me a straight 'lash-gram.
No fancy stuff, just a demonstration throw. I want a clean ripple
the length of the beam. Don't try for angspace, just 'lash it."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Have you popped your skull? Any 'lash can hit angspace. And you
get one fleck of dust in that beam path..."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"We'd rip the sides off the tube; I know. But this is a clean
beam, Poss. I can see it. I just want a little ripple."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Why?"</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Can I tell him?</EM> Ing wondered.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing decided to tell only part of the truth, said: "I want to
check the cleaner tempo during the program. Give me a debris
monitor and a crossing count for each observation post. Have them
focus on the cleaners, not on the beam."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Why?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"You can see for yourself cleaner activity doesn't agree with
the beam condition," Ing said. "Something's wrong there-accumulated
programming error or... I dunno. But I want some actual facts to go
on-a physical count during a 'lash."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"You're not going to get new data running a test that could be
repeated in the laboratory."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"This isn't a laboratory."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Washington absorbed this, then: "Where would you be during the
'lash?"</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>He's going to do it,</EM> Ing thought. He said: "I'll be
close to the anode end here. 'Lash can't swing too wide here."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"And if we damage the tube?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing hesitated remembering that it was a friend out there, a
friend with responsibilities. No telling who might be monitoring
the conversation, though... and this test was vital to the idea
nibbling at Ing's awareness.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Humor me, Poss," Ing said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Humor him," Washington muttered. "All right, but this'd better
not be humorous."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Wait till I'm in position," Ing said. "A straight 'lash."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He began working up the tube slope out of Zone Yellow into the
Gray and then the White. Here, he turned, studied the beam. It was
a thin purple ribbon stretching off left and right-shorter on the
left toward the anode. The long reach of it going off toward the
cathode some twelve kilometers to his right was a thin wisp of
color broken by the flickering passage of cleaners.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Any time," Ing said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He adjusted the suit rests against the tube's curve, pulled his
arms into the barrel top, started the viewplate counter recording
movement of the cleaners. Now came the hard part-waiting and
watching. He had a sudden feeling of isolation then, wondering if
he'd done the right thing. There was an element of burning bridges
in this action.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>What did the handbook say? <EM>"There is no point in</EM>
<EM>planning sophisticated research on a specific factor's</EM>
<EM>role unless that factor is known to be present."</EM></P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>If it isn't there, you can't study it,</EM> Ing thought.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"You will take your work seriously," he muttered. Ing smiled
then, thinking of the tragicomic faces, the jowly board chairmen he
visualized behind the handbook's pronouncements. Nothing was left
to chance-no task, no item of personal tidiness, no physical
exercise. Ing considered himself an expert on handbooks. He owned
one of the finest collections of them dating from ancient times
down to the present. In moments of boredom he amused himself with
choice quotes.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Program going in," Washington said. "I wish I knew what you
hope to find by this."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"I quote," Ing said. "The objective worker makes as large a
collection of data as possible and analyzes these in their entirety
in relation to selected factors whose relationship to a questioned
phenomenon is to be investigated."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"What the devil's that supposed to mean?" Washing&#173;ton
demanded.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Damned if I know," Ing said, "but it's right out of the Haigh
Handbook." He cleared his throat. "What's the cleaner tempo from
your stations?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Up a bit."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Give me a countdown on the 'lash."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"No sign yet. There's... wait a minute! Here's some
action-twenty-five... twenty seconds."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing began counting under his breath.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Zero.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A progression of tiny flares began far off to his right,
flickered past him with increasing brightness. They were a blur
that left a glimmering afterimage. Sensors in his suit soles began
reporting the fall of debris.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Holy O'Golden!" Washington muttered.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"How many'd we lose?" Ing asked. He knew it was going to be
bad-worse than he'd expected.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>There was a long wait, then Washington's shocked voice: "A
hundred and eighteen cleaners down. It isn't possible!"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Yeah," Ing said. "They're all over the floor. Shut off the beam
before that dust drifts up into it."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The beam disappeared from Ing's faceplate responders.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Is that what you thought would happen, Ing?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Kind of."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Why didn't you warn me?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"You wouldn't have given me that 'lash."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Well how the devil're we going to explain a hundred and
eighteen cleaners? Accounting'll be down on my neck like a..."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Forget Accounting," Ing said. "You're a beam engineer; open
your eyes. Those cleaners weren't absorbed by the beam. They were
cut down and scattered over the floor."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"But the..."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Cleaners are designed to respond to the beam's needs," Ing
said. "As the beam moves they move. As the debris count goes up,
the cleaners work harder. It one works a little too hard and
doesn't get out of the way fast enough, it's supposed to be
absorbed-its energy converted by the beam. Now, a false 'lash
catches a hundred and eighteen of them off balance. Those cleaners
weren't eaten; they were scattered over the floor."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>There was silence while Washington absorbed this,</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Did that 'lash touch angspace?" Ing asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"I'm checking," Washington said. Then: "No...wait a minute:
there's a whole ripple of angspace... contacts, very low energy-a
series lasting about an eighty-millionth of a second. I had the
responders set to the last decimal or we'd have never caught
it."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"To all intents and purposes we didn't touch," Ing said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Practically not." Then: "Could somebody in cleaner programming
have flubbed the dub?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"On a hundred and eighteen units?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Yeah. I see what you mean. Well, what're we going to say when
they come around for an explanation?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"We quote the book. 'Each problem should be approached in two
stages: (1) locate those areas which contribute most to the
malfunction, and (2) take remedial action designed to reduce
hazards which have been positively identified.' We tell 'em, Poss,
that we were positively identifying hazards."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing stepped over the lock sill into the executive salon, saw
that Washington already was seated at the corner table which
convention reserved for the senior beam engineer on duty, the
Supervisor of Trans&#173;mission.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>It was too late for day lunch and too early for the second shift
coffee break. The salon was almost empty.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Three junior executives at a table across the room to the right
were sharing a private joke, but keeping it low in Washington's
presence. A security officer sat nursing a teabulb beside the
passage to the kitchen tram on the left. His shoulders bore a touch
of dampness from a perspiration reclaimer to show that he had
recently come down from the surface. Security had a lot of officers
on the station, Ing noted... and there always seemed to be one
around Washington.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The vidwall at the back was tuned to an Earthside news
broadcast: There were hints of political upsets because of the beam
failure, demands for explanations of the money spent. Washington
was quoted as saying a solution would be forthcoming.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing began making his way toward the corner, moving around the
empty tables.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Washington had a coffeebulb in front of him, steam drifting
upward. Ing studied the man-Possible Washington (Impossible,
according to his junior engineers) was a six-foot eight-inch
powerhouse of a man with wide shoulders, sensitive hands, a sharply
Moorish-Semitic face of cafe au lait skin and startingly blue eyes
under a dark crewcut. (The company's senior medic referred to him
as "a most amazing throw of the genetic dice.") Washington's size
said a great deal about his abilities. It took a considerable
expenditure to lift his extra kilos moonside. He had to be worth
just that much more.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing sat down across from Washington, gestured to the waiter-eye
on the table surface, ordered Mars-lichen tea.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"You just come from Assembly?" Washington asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"They said you were up here," Ing said. "You look tired,
Earthside give you any trouble about your report?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Until I used your trick and quoted the book: 'Every test under
field conditions shall approximate as closely as possible the
conditions set down by laboratory precedent.'"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Hey, that's a good one," Ing said. "Why didn't you tell them
you were following a hunch-you had a hunch I had a hunch."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Washington smiled.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing took a deep breath. It felt good to sit down. He realized
he'd worked straight through two shifts without a break.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"You look tired yourself," Washington said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing nodded. Yes, he was tired. He was too old to push this hard.
Ing had few illusions about himself. He'd always been a runt, a
little on the weak side- skinny and with an almost weaselish face
that was saved from ugliness by widely set green eyes and a thick
crewcut mop of golden hair. The hair was turning gray now, but the
brain behind the wide brow still functioned smoothly.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The teabulb came up through the table slot. Ing pulled the bulb
to him, cupped his hands around its warmth. He had counted on
Washington to keep the worst of the official pressure off him, but
now that it had been done, Ing felt guilty.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"No matter how much I quote the book," Washing&#173;ton said,
"they don't like that explanation."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Heads will roll and all that?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"To put it mildly."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Well we have a position chart on where every cleaner went
down," Ing said. "Every piece of wreckage has been reassembled as
well as possible. The undamaged cleaners have been gone over with
the proverbial comb of fine teeth."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"How long until we have a clean tube?" Washington asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"About eight hours."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing moved his shoulders against the chair. His thigh muscles
still ached from the long session in the Skoarnoff tube and there
was a pain across his shoulders.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Then it's time for some turkey talk," Washington said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing had been dreading this moment. He knew the stand Washington
was going to take.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The Security officer across the room looked up, met Ing's eyes,
looked away. <EM>Is he listening to us?</EM> Ing wondered.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"You're thinking what the others thought," Wash&#173;ington
said. "That those cleaners were kicked around the corner into
angspace."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"One way to find out," Ing said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>There was a definite lift to the Security officer's chin at that
remark. He <EM>was</EM> listening.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"You're not taking that suicide ride," Washington said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Are the other beams getting through to the Seed Ships?" Ing
asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"You know they aren't!"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Across the room, the junior executives stopped their own
conversation, peered toward the corner table. The Security officer
hitched his chair around to watch both the executives and the
corner table.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing took a sip of his tea, said: "Damn' tea here's always too
bitter. They don't know how to serve it anywhere except on Mars."
He pushed the bulb away from him. "Join the Haigh Company and save
the Universe for Man."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"All right, Ing," Washington said. "We've known each other a
long time and can speak straight out. What're you hiding from
me?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing sighed.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"I guess I owe it to you," he said. "Well, I guess it begins
with the fact that every transmitter's a unique individual, which
you know as well as I do. We map what it does and operate by
prediction statistics. We play it by ear, as they say. Now, let's
consider something out of the book. A tube is, after all, just a
big cave in the rock, a controlled environment for the beam to do
its work. The book says: <EM>'By anglespace transmission, any place
in the universe is just around the corner from any other
place.'</EM> This is a damned loose way to describe something we
don't really understand. It makes it sound as though we know what
we're talking about."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"And you say we're putting matter around that corner,"
Washington said, "but you haven't told me what you're-"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"I know," Ing said. "We place a modulation of energy where it
can be <EM>seen</EM> by the Seed Ship's instruments. But that's a
transfer of energy, Poss. And energy's interchangeable with
matter."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"You're twisting definitions.  We put a highly unstable, highly
transitory reflection phenomenon in such a position that time/space
limitations are" changed. That's by the book, too. But you're still
not telling me..."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Poss, I have a crew rigging a cleaner for me to ride. We've
analyzed the destruction pattern-which is what I wanted from that
test 'lash-and I think we can kick me into angspace aboard one of
these wild geese."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"You fool! I'm still Supetrans here and I say you're not going
in there on..."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Now, take it easy, Poss. You haven't even..."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Granting you get kicked around that stupid corner, how do you
expect to get back? And what's the purpose, anyway? What can you do
if you..."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"I can go there and look, Poss. And the cleaner we're rigging
will be more in the nature of a lifeboat. I can get down on TA-IV,
maybe take the container with me, give our <EM>seeds a</EM> better
chance. And if we learn how to kick me around there, we can do it
again with..."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"This is stupidity!"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Look," Ing said. "What're we risking? One old man long past his
prime."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing faced the angry glare in Washington's eyes and realized an
odd thing about himself. He wanted to get through there, wanted to
give that container of embryos its chance. He was drunk with the
same dream that had spawned the Seeding Compact. And he saw now
that the other troubleshooters, the six who'd gone before him, must
have been caught in the same web. They'd all seen where the trouble
had to be. One of them would get through. There were tools in the
container; another beam could be rigged on the other side. There
was a chance of getting back,.. afterward...</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"I let them talk me into sending for you," Washington growled.
"The understanding was you'd examine the set up, confirm or deny
what the others . saw-but I didn't have to send you into
that..."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"I want to go, Poss," Ing said. He saw what was eating on his
friend now. The man had sent six troubleshooters in there to die-or
disappear into an untraceable void, which was worse. Guilt had
him.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>And I'm refusing permission, Washington said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The Security officer arose from his table, crossed to stand over
Washington. "Mr. Washington," he said, "I've been listening and it
seems to me if Mr. Gump wants to go you can't..."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Washington got to his feet, all six feet eight inches of him,
caught the Security man by the jacket. "So they told you to
interfere if I tried to stop him!" He shook the man with an odd
gentleness. "If you are on my station after the next shuttle
leaves, I will see to it per&#173;sonally that you have an
unexplained accident." He released his grip.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The Security agent paled, but stood his ground. "One call from
me and this no longer will be <EM>your</EM> station."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Poss," Ing said, "you can't fight city hall. And if you try
they'll take you out of here. Then I'll have to make do with second
best at this end. I need you as beam jockey here when I ride that
wild goose."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Washington glared at him. "Ing, it won't work!"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing studied his friend, seeing the pressures which had been
brought to bear, understanding how Earthside had maneuvered to get
that request sent from a friend to Ivar Norris Gump. It all said
something about Earthside's desperation. The patterns of secrecy,
the Security watch, the hints in the newscasts-Ing felt something
of the same urgency himself which these things betrayed. And he
knew if Washington could overcome this guilt block the man would
share mankind's need to help those drifting containers.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"No matter how many people get hurt-or killed," Ing said, "we
have to give the embryos in those containers their chance. You
know, I'm right-this is the main chance. And we need you, Poss. I
want everything going for me I can get. And no matter what happens,
we'll know you did your best for me..."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Washington took two short breaths. His shoulders slumped. "And
nothing I say..."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Nothing you say."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"You're going?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"I'm going where the wild goose goes."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"And who faces the family afterward?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"A friend, Poss. A friend faces the family and makes the blow as
soft as possible."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"If you'll excuse me," the Security officer said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>They ignored him as the man returned to his table.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Washington allowed himself a deep, sighing breath. Some of the
fire returned to his eyes. "All right," he growled. "But I'm going
to be on this end every step of the way. And I'm telling you now
you get no Go signal until everything's rigged to my
satisfaction."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Of course, Poss. That's why I can't afford to have you get into
a fracas and be booted out of here."</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing's left ankle itched.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>It was maddening. His hand could reach only to the calf inside
the webbing of his shieldsuit. The ankle and its itch could not be
lifted from the area of the sole contact controls.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The suit itself lay suspended in an oil bath within a shocktank.
Around the shocktank was something that resembled a standard
cleaner in shape but not in size. It was at least twice the length
of a cleaner and it was fatter. The fatness allowed for phased
shells-Washington's idea. It had grown out of analysis of the
debris left by the test 'lash.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The faint hissing of his oxygen regenerators came to Ing through
his suit sensors. His viewplate had been replaced by a set of
screens linked to exterior pickups. The largest screen, at top
center, reported the view from a scanner on the belly. It showed a
rope of fluorescing purple surrounded by blackness.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The beam.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>It was a full five centimeters across, larger than Ing had ever
before seen it. The nearness of that potential violence filled him
with a conditioned dread. He'd milked too many beams in too many
tubes, wary of the slightest growth in size to keep him at a safe
distance.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>This was a monster beam. All his training and experience cried
out against its size.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing reminded himself of the analysis which had produced the
false cleaner around him now.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Eighty-nine of the cleaners recovered from the tube floor had
taken their primary damage at the pickup orifice. They'd been
oriented to the beam itself, disregarding the local particle count.
But the most important discovery was that the cleaners had fallen
through the beam without being sliced in two. They had passed
completely through the blade of that purple knife without being
severed. There'd been no break in the beam. The explanation had to
rest in that topological anomaly-angspace. Part of the beam and/or
the cleaners had gone into angspace.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He was gambling his life now that the angspace bounce coincided
with the energy phasing which kept the cleaners from deflecting the
beam. The outside carrier, Ing's false cleaner, was phased with the
beam. It would be demolished. The next inner shell was one hundred
and eighty degrees out of phase. The next shell was back in phase.
And so on for ten shells.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>In the center lay Ing his hands and feet on the controls of a
suit that was in effect a miniature lifeboat.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>As the moment of final commitment approached, Ing began to feel
a prickly sensation in his stomach. And the ankle continued to
itch. But there was no way he could turn back and still live with
himself. He was a troubleshooter, the best in the Haigh Company.
There was no doubt that the company-and those lonely drifting human
embryos had never needed him more desperately.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Report your condition, Ing."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The voice coming from the speaker beside Ing's face-mask was
Washington's with an unmistakable edge of fear in it.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"All systems clear," Ing said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Program entering its second section," Washington said. "Can you
see any of the other cleaners?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Forty contacts so far," Ing said. "All normal." He gasped as
his cleaner dodged a transient 'lash.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"You all right?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"All right," Ing said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The ride continued to be a rough one, though. Each time the beam
'lashed, his cleaner dodged. There was no way to anticipate the
direction. Ing could only trust his suit webbing and the oil-bath
shocktank to keep him from being smashed against a side of the
compartment.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"We're getting an abnormal number of transients," Washington
said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>That called for no comment and Ing remained silent. He looked up
at his receiver above the speaker. A quartz window gave him a view
of the tiny beam which kept him in contact with Washington. The
tiny beam, less than a centimeter long, glowed sharply purple
through its inspection window. It, too, was crackling and jumping.
The little beam could stand more interference than a big one, but
it clearly was disturbed.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing turned his attention to the big beam in the
view&#173;screen, glanced back at the little beam. The difference
was a matter of degree. It often seemed to Ing that the beams
should illuminate the area around them, and he had to remind
himself that the parallel quanta couldn't deviate that much.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Getting 'lash count," Washington said. "Ing! Condition
critical! Stand by."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing concentrated on the big beam now. His stomach was a hard
knot. He wondered how the other troubleshooters had felt in this
moment. The same, no doubt. But they'd been flying without the
protection Ing had. They'd paved the way, died to give
informa&#173;tion.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The view of the beam was so close and restricted that Ing knew
he'd get no warning of the whip-just a sudden shift in size or
position.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>His heart leaped as the beam flared in the screen. The cleaner
rolled sideways as it dodged, letting the beam pass to one side,
but there was an ominous bump. Momentarily, the screen went blank,
but the purple rope flickered back into view as his cleaner's
sensors lined up and brought him back into position.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing checked his instruments. That bump-what had that been?</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Ing!" Washington's voice came sharply urgent from the
speaker.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"What's the word?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"We have one of the other cleaners on grav-track," Washington
said. "It's in your shadow. Hold on."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>There came a murmur of voices, hushed words, indistinguishable,
then: "The beam touched you, Ing. You've got a phase arc between
two of your shells on the side opposite the beam. One of the other
cleaners has locked onto that arc with one of its sensors. Its
other sensors are still on the beam and it's riding parallel with
you, in your shadow. We're getting you out of there."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing tried to swallow in a dry throat. He knew the danger without
having it explained. There was an arc, light in the tube. His
cleaner was between the arc and the beam, but the other cleaner was
up there behind him, too. If they had to dodge a 'lash, the other
cleaner would be confused because its sensor contacts were now
split. It'd be momentarily delayed. The two cleaners would collide
and release light in the tube. The big beam would go wild. The
protective shells would be struck from all sides.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Washington was working to get him out, but that would take time.
You couldn't just yank a primary program out. That created its own
'lash conditions. And if you damped the beam, the other cleaners
would home on the arc. There'd be carnage in the tube.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Starting phase out," Washington said. "Estimating three minutes
to control the second phase. We'll just..."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"'Lash!"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The word rang in Ing's ears even as he felt his cleaner lift at
the beginning of a dodge maneuver. He had time to think that the
warning must've come from one of the engineers on the monitor
board, then a giant gong rang out.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A startled: "What the hell!" blasted from his speaker to be
replaced by a strident hissing, the ravening of a billion
snakes.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing felt his cleaner still lifting, pressing him down against
the webbing, his face hard against the protective mask. There was
no view of the big beam in his screen and the small beam revealed a
wavering, crackling worm of red-little window which should've
showed the line of his own beam revealed a wavering, crackling worm
of red-purple.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Abruptly, Ing's world twisted inside out.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>It was like being squeezed flat into a one-molecule puddle and
stretched out to infinity. He <EM>saw</EM> around the outside of an
inner-viewed universe with light extended to hard rods of
brilliance that poked through from one end to the other. He
realized he wasn't seeing with his eyes, but was absorbing a
sensation compounded from every sense organ he possessed. Beyond
this inner view everything was chaos, undefined madness.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>The beam got me,</EM> he thought. <EM>I'm dying.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>One of the light rods resolved itself into a finite row of
spinning objects-over, under, around... over, under, around. The
movement was hypnotic. With a feeling of wonder, Ing recognized
that the object was his own suit and a few shattered pieces of the
protective shells. The tiny beam of his own transmitter had been
opened and was spitting shards of purple.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>With the recognition came a sensation of being compressed. Ing
felt himself being pushed down into the blackness that jerked at
him, twisting, pounding. It was like going over a series of rapids.
He felt the web harness bite into his skin.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Abruptly, the faceplate viewscreens showed jewel brilliance
against velvet black-spots of light: sharp blue, red, green, gold.
A glaring white light spun into view surrounded by whipping purple
ribbons. The ribbons looked like beam auroras.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing's body ached. His mind felt as though immersed in fog, every
thought laboring against deadly slowness.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Jewel brilliance-spots of light.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Again, glaring white.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Purple ribbons.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The speaker above him crackled with static. Through its window,
he saw his tiny beam spattering and jumping. It seemed important to
do something about that. Ing slipped a hand into one of his suit
arms, encountered a shattered piece of protective shell drifting
close.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The idea of drifting seemed vital, but he couldn't decide
why.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gently, he nudged the piece of shell up until it formed a rough
shield over his receiver beam.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Immediately, a tinny little voice came from his speaker: "Ing!
Come in, Ing! Can you hear me, Ing?" Then, more distant: "You
there! To hell with the locks! Suit up and get in there. He must be
down..."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Poss?" Ing said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Ing! Is that you, Ing?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Yeah, Poss. I'm...I seem to be all in one piece."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Are you down on the floor some place? We're coming in after
you. Hold on."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"I dunno where I am. I can see beam auroras."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Don't try to move. The tube's all smashed to hell. I'm patched
through the Imbrium tube to talk to you. Just stay put. We'll be
right with you."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Poss, I don't think I'm in the tube."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>From some place that Ing felt existed on a very tenuous basis,
he felt his thoughts stirring, recognition patterns forming.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Some of the jewel brilliance he saw was stars. He saw that now.
Some of it was... debris, bits and pieces of cleaners, odd chunks
of matter. There was light somewhere toward his feet, but the
sensors there appeared to've been destroyed or something was
covering them.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Debris.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beam auroras.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The glaring white spun once more into view. Ing adjusted his
spin with a short burst from a finger jet. He saw the thing clearly
now, recognized it: the ball and sensor tubes of a Seeding Compact
container.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He grew conscious that the makeshift shield for his little beam
had slipped. Static filled his speakers. Ing replaced the bit of
shell.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"... Do you mean you're not in the tube?" Washing&#173;ton's
voice asked. "Ing, come in. What's wrong?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"There's an SC container about a hundred meters or so directly
in front of me," Ing said. "It's surrounded by cleaner debris. And
there're auroras, angspace ribbons, all over the sky here. I...
think I've come through."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"You couldn't have. I'm receiving you too strong. What's this
about auroras?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"That's why you're receiving me,," Ing said. "You're stitching a
few pieces of beam through here. Light all over the place; there's
a sun down beneath my feet somewhere. You're getting through to me,
but the container's almost surrounded by junk. The reflection and
beam spatter in there must be enormous. I'm going in now and clean
a path for the beam contact."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Are you sure you're..." <EM>Hiss, crackle.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>The little piece of shell had slipped again.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing cased it back into position as he maneuvered with his belt
jets.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"I'm all right, Poss."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The turn brought the primary into view-a great golden ball that
went dim immediately as his scanner filters adjusted. To his right
beyond the sun lay a great ball of blue with chunks of cottony
clouds drifting over it. Ing stared, transfixed by the beauty of
it.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A virgin planet.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A check of the lifeboat instruments installed in his suit showed
what the SC container had revealed before contact had gone
intermittent-Theta Apus IV, almost Earth normal except for larger
oceans, smaller land masses.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing took a deep breath, smelled the canned air of his suit.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>To work,</EM> he thought.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>His suit jets brought him in close to the debris and he began
nudging it aside, moving in closer and closer to the container. He
lost his beam shield, ignored it, cut down receiver volume to
reduce the static.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Presently, he drifted beside the container.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>With an armored hand, he shielded his beam.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Poss? Come in, Poss."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Are you really there, Ing?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Try a beam contact with the container, Poss."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"We'll have to break contact with you."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Do it."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing waited.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Auroral activity increased-great looping ribbons over the sky
all around him.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>So that's what it looks like at the receiving end,</EM> Ing
thought. He looked up at the window revealing his own beam-clean
and sharp under the shadow of his upraised hand. The armored
fingers were black outlines against the blue world beyond. He began
calculating then how long his own beam would last without
replacement of anode and cathode. Hard bombardment, sharp tiny
beam-its useful life would only be a fraction of what a big beam
could expect.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Have to find a way to rig a beam once we get down,</EM> he
thought.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Ing? Come in, Ing?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing heard the excitement in Washington's voice.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"You got through, eh, Poss, old boss?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Loud and clear. Now, look-if you can weld yourself fast to the
tail curve of that container we can get you down with it. It's
over-engineered to handle twice your mass on landing sequence."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing nodded to himself. Riding the soft, safe balloon, which the
container would presently become, offered a much more attractive
prospect than maneuvering his suit down, burning it out above a
watery world where a landing on solid ground would take some
doing.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"We're maneuvering to give re-entry for contact with a major
land mass," Washington said. "Tell us when you're fast to the
container."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing maneuvered in close, put an armored hand on the container's
surface, feeling an odd sensation of communion with the metal and
life that had spent nine hundred years in the void.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Old papa Ing's going to look after you,</EM> he thought.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>As he worked, welding himself solidly to the tail curve of the
container, Ing recalled the chaos he had glimpsed in his spewing,
jerking ride through angspace.<BR>
<BR></P>
<P>He shuddered.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Ing, when you feel up to it, we want a detailed report,"
Washington said. "We're planning now to put people through for
every one of the containers that's giving trouble."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"You figured out how to get us back?" Ing asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Earthside says it has the answer if you can assemble enough
mass at your end to anchor a full-sized beam."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Again, Ing thought of that ride through chaos. He wasn't sure he
wanted another such trip. Time to solve that problem when it arose,
though. There'd be something in the book about it.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ing smiled at himself then, sensing an instinctive reason for
all the handbooks of history. Against chaos, man had to raise a
precise and orderly alignment of actions, a system within which he
could sense his own existence.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>A watery world down there,</EM> he thought. <EM>Have to</EM>
<EM>find some way to make paper for these kids before they</EM>
<EM>come out of their vats. Plenty of things to teach
them.</EM></P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Watery world.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>He recalled then a sentence of swimming instruc&#173;tions from
the "Blue Jackets Manual," one of the ancient handbooks in his
collection: "Breathing may be accomplished by swimming with the
head out of water."</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Have to remember that one,</EM> he thought. <EM>The
kids'll</EM> <EM>need a secure and orderly world.</EM></P>

<P> </P>
<P>With an increasing sense of unease, Alan Wallace studied his
client as they neared the public hearing room on the second floor
of the Old Senate Orace Building. The guy was too relaxed.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Bill, I'm worried about this,' Wallace said. 'You could damn
well lose your grazing rights here in this room today.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>They were almost into the gantlet of guards, reporters and TV
cameramen before Wallace got his answer.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Who the hell cares?' Custer asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Wallace, who prided himself on being the Washington-type lawyer
- above contamination by complaints and briefs, immune to all shock
- found himself tongue-tied with surprise.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>They were into the ruck then and Wallace had to pull on his bold
face, smiling at the press, trying to soften the sharpness of that
necessary phrase:</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'No comment. Sorry.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'See us after the hearing if you have any questions, gentlemen,'
Custer said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The man's voice was level and confident.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>He has himself over-controlled,</EM> Wallace thought.
<EM>Maybe he was just joking ... a graveyard joke.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>The marble-walled hearing room blazed with lights. Camera
platforms had been raised above the seats at the rear. Some of the
smaller UHF stations had their cameramen standing on the window
ledges.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The subdued hubbub of the place eased slightly, Wallace noted,
then picked up tempo as William R. Custer - 'The Baron of Oregon'
they called him - entered with his attorney, passed the press
tables and crossed to the seats reserved for them in the witness
section.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ahead and to their right, that one empty chair at the long table
stood waiting with its aura of complete exposure.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'<EM>Who the hell cares?'</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>That wasn't a Custer-type joke, Wallace reminded himself. For
all his cattle-baron pose, Custer held a doctorate in agriculture
and degrees in philosophy, math and electronics. His western
neighbors called him 'The Brain'.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>It was no accident that the cattlemen had chosen him to
represent them here.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Wallace glanced covertly at the man, studying him. The cowboy
boots and string tie added to a neat dark business suit would have
been affectation on most men. They merely accented Custer's good
looks - the sun-burned, windblown outdoorsman. He was a little
darker of hair and skin than his father had been, still light
enough to be called blonde, but not as ruddy and without the late
father's drink-tumescent veins.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>But then young Custer wasn't quite thirty.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Custer turned, met the attorney's eyes. He smiled.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Those were good patent attorneys you recommended, Al,' Custer
said. He lifted his briefcase to his lap, patted it. 'No mincing
around or mealy-mouthed excuses. Already got this thing on the
way.' Again, he tapped the briefcase.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>He brought that damn' light gadget here with him?</EM>
Wallace wondered. <EM>Why?</EM> He glanced at the briefcase.
<EM>Didn't know it was that small ... but maybe he's just talking
about the plans for it.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Let's keep our minds on this hearing,' Wallace whispered. 'This
is the only thing that's important.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Into a sudden lull in the room's high noise level, the voice of
someone in the press section carried across them: 'greatest
political show on earth.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I brought this as an exhibit,' Custer said. Again, he tapped
the briefcase. It <EM>did</EM> bulge oddly.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Exhibit?</EM> Wallace asked himself.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>It was the second time in ten minutes that Custer had shocked
him. This was to be a hearing of a subcommittee of the Senate
Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. The issue was Taylor
grazing lands. What the devil could that ... <EM>gadget</EM> have
to do with the battle of words and laws to be fought here?</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You're supposed to talk over all strategy with your attorney,'
Wallace whispered. 'What the devil do you ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He broke off as the room fell suddenly silent.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Wallace looked up to see the subcommittee chairman, Senator
Haycourt Tiborough, stride through the wide double doors followed
by his coterie of investigators and attorneys. The senator was a
tall man who had once been fat. He had dieted with such savage
abruptness that his skin had never recovered. His jowls and the
flesh on the back of his hands sagged. The top of his head was
shiny bald and ringed by a three-quarter tonsure that had purposely
been allowed to grow long and straggly so that it fanned back over
his ears.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The senator was followed in close lock step by syndicated
columnist Anthony Poxman who was speaking fiercely into Tiborough's
left ear. TV cameras tracked the pair.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>If Poxman's covering this one himself instead of sending a
flunky, it's going to be bad,</EM> Wallace told himself.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Tiborough took his chair at the center of the committee table
feeing them, glanced left and right to assure himself the other
members were present.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Senator Spealance was absent, Wallace noted, but he had party
organization difficulties at home, and the Senior Senator from
Oregon was, significantly, not present. Illness, it was
reported.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A sudden attack of caution, that common Washington malady, no
doubt. He knew where his campaign money came from ... but he also
knew where the votes were.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>They had a quorum, though.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Tiborough cleared his throat, said: 'The committee will please
come to order.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The senator's voice and manner gave Wallace a cold chill. <EM>We
were nuts trying to fight this one in the open,</EM> he thought.
<EM>Why'd I let Custer and his friends talk me into this? You can't
butt heads with a United States senator who's out to get you. The
only way's to fight him on the inside.</EM></P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>And now Custer suddenly turned screwball.</EM></P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Exhibit 1</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Gentlemen,' said Tiborough, 'I think we can ... that is, today
we can dispense with preliminaries ... unless my colleagues ... if
any of them have objections.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Again, he glanced at the other senators - five of them. Wallace
swept his gaze down the line behind that table - Flowers of
Nebraska (a horse trader), Johnstone of Ohio (a parliamentarian -
devious), Lane of South Carolina (a Republican in Democrat
disguise), Emery of Minnesota (new and eager - dangerous because he
lacked the old inhibitions) and Meltzer of New York (poker player,
fine old family with traditions).</P>
<P> </P>
<P>None of them had objections.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>They've had a private meeting - both sides of the aisle -
and talked over a smooth steamroller procedure,</EM> Wallace
thought.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>It was another ominous sign.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'This is a subcommittee of the United States Senate Committee on
Interior and Insular Affairs,' Tiborough said, his tone formal. 'We
are charged with obtaining expert opinion on proposed amendments to
the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934. Today's hearing will begin with
testimony and ... ah, questioning of a man whose family has been in
the business of raising beef cattle in Oregon for three
generations.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Tiborough smiled at the TV cameras.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>The son-of-a-bitch is playing to the galleries,</EM> Wallace
thought. He glanced at Custer. The cattleman sat relaxed against
the back of his chair, eyes half lidded, staring at the
senator.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We call as our first witness today Mr William R. Custer of
Bend, Oregon,' Tiborough said. 'Will the clerk please swear in Mr
Custer.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Custer moved forward to the 'hot seat', placed his briefcase on
the table. Wallace pulled a chair up beside his client, noted how
the cameras turned as the clerk stepped forward, put the Bible on
the table and administered the oath.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Tiborough ruffled through some papers in front of him, waited
for full attention to return to him, said: 'This subcommittee ...
we have before us a bill, this is a United States Senate Bill
entitled SB-1024 of the current session, an act amending the Taylor
Grazing Act of 1934 and, the intent is, as many have noted, that we
would broaden the base of the advisory committees to the Act and
include a wider public representation.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Custer was fiddling with the clasp of his briefcase.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>How the hell could that light gadget be an exhibit
here?</EM> Wallace asked himself. He glanced at the set of Custer's
jaw, noted the nervous working of a muscle. It was the first sign
of unease he'd seen in Custer. The sight failed to settle Wallace's
own nerves.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ah, Mr Custer,' Tiborough said. 'Do you - did you bring a
preliminary statement? Your counsel ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I have a statement,' Custer said. His big voice rumbled through
the room, requiring instant attention and the shift of cameras that
had been holding tardily on Tiborough, expecting an addition to the
question.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Tiborough smiled, waited, then: 'Your attorney - is your
statement the one your counsel supplied the committee?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'With some slight additions of my own' Custer said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Wallace felt a sudden qualm. They were too willing to accept
Custer's statement. He leaned close to his client's ear, whispered:
'They know what your stand is. Skip the preliminaries.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Custer ignored him, said: 'I intend to speak plainly and simply.
I oppose the amendment. Broaden the base and wider public
representation are phases of political double talk. The intent is
to pack the committees, to put control of them into the hands of
people who don't know the first thing about the cattle business and
whose private intent is to destroy The Taylor Grazing Act
itself.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Plain, simple talk,' Tiborough said. 'This committee ... we
welcome such directness. Strong words. A majority of this committee
... we have taken the position that the public range lands have
been too long subjected to the tender mercies of the stockmen
advisors, that the lands ... stockmen have exploited them to their
own advantage.'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>The gloves were off.</EM> Wallace thought. <EM>I hope Custer
knows what he's doing. He's sure as hell not accepting
advice.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>Custer pulled a sheaf of papers from his briefcase and Wallace
glimpsed shiny metal in the case before the flap was closed.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Christ! That looked like a gun or something!</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>Then Wallace recognized the papers - the brief he and his staff
had labored over - and the preliminary statement. He noted with
alarm the penciled markings and marginal notations. How could
Custer have done that much to it in just twenty-four hours?</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Again, Wallace whispered in Custer's ear: 'Take it easy, Bill.
The bastard's out for blood.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Custer nodded to show he had heard, glanced at the papers,
looked up directly at Tiborough.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A hush settled on the room, broken only by the scraping of a
chair somewhere in the rear, and the whirr of cameras.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1"><STRONG>Chapter II</STRONG></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'First, the nature of these lands we're talking about,' Custer
said. 'In my state ...' He cleared his throat, a mannerism that
would have indicated anger in the old man, his father. There was no
break in Custer's expression, though, and his voice remained level.
'... in my state, these were mostly Indian lands. This nation took
them by brute force, right of conquest. That's about the oldest
right in the world, I guess. I don't want to argue with it at this
point.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Mr Custer.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>It was Nebraska's Senator Flowers, his amiable farmer's face set
in a tight grin. 'Mr Custer, I hope.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Is this a point of order?' Tiborough asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Mr Chairman,' Flowers said, 'I merely wished to make sure we
weren't going to bring up that old suggestion about giving these
lands back to the Indians.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Laughter shot across the hearing room. Tiborough chuckled as he
pounded his gavel for order.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You may continue, Mr Custer,' Tiborough said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Custer looked at Flowers, said: 'No, Senator, I don't want to
give these lands back to the Indians. When they had these lands,
they only got about three hundred pounds of meat a year off eighty
acres. We get five hundred pounds of the highest grade proteins -
premium beef - from only ten acres.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'No one doubts the efficiency of your factory-like methods,'
Tiborough said. 'You can ... we know your methods wring the largest
amount of meat from a minimum acreage.'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Ugh!</EM> Wallace thought. <EM>That was a low blow -
implying Bill's overgrazing and destroying the land value.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'My neighbors, the Warm Springs Indians, use the same methods I
do,' Custer said. 'They are happy to adopt our methods because we
use the land while maintaining it and increasing its value. We
don't permit the land to fall prey to natural disasters such as
fire and erosion. We don't ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'No doubt your methods are meticulously correct,' Tiborough
said. 'But I fail to see where ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Has Mr Custer finished his preliminary statement yet?' Senator
Flowers cut in.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Wallace shot a startled look at the Nebraskan. That was help
from an unexpected quarter.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Thank you, Senator,' Custer said. 'I'm quite willing to adapt
to the Chairman's methods and explain the meticulous correctness of
my operation. Our lowliest cowhands are college men, highly paid.
We travel ten times as many jeep miles as we do horse miles. Every
outlying division of the ranch - every holding pen and grazing
supervisor's cabin is linked to the central ranch by radio. We use
the ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I concede that your methods must be the most modern in the
world,' Tiborough said. 'It's not your methods as much as the
results of those methods that are at issue here. We ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He broke off at a disturbance by the door. An Army colonel was
talking to the guard there. He wore Special Services fouragere -
Pentagon.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Wallace noted with an odd feeling of disquiet that the man was
armed - a .45 at the hip. The weapon was out of place on him, as
though he had added it suddenly on an overpowering need ...
emergency.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>More guards were coming up outside the door now - Marines and
Army. They carried rifles.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The colonel said something sharp to the guard, turned away from
him and entered the committee room. All the cameras were tracking
him now. He ignored them, crossed swiftly to Tiborough and spoke to
him.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The senator shot a startled glance at Custer, accepted a sheaf
of papers the colonel thrust at him. He forced his attention off
Custer, studied the papers, leafing through them. Presently, he
looked up, stared at Custer.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A hush fell over the room.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I find myself at a loss, Mr Custer,' Tiborough said. 'I have
here a copy of a report ... it's from the Special Services branch
of the Army ... through the Pentagon, you understand. It was just
handed to me by, ah ... the colonel here.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He looked up at the colonel who was standing, one hand resting
lightly on the bolstered .45. Tiborough looked back at Custer and
it was obvious the senator was trying to marshall his thoughts.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It is,' Tiborough said, 'that is ... this report supposedly ...
and I have every confidence it is what it is represented to be ...
here in my hands ... they say that ... uh, within the last, uh, few
days they have, uh, investigated a certain device ... weapon they
call it, that you are attempting to patent. They report ...' He
glanced at the papers, back to Custer, who was staring at him
steadily. '... this, uh, weapon, is a thing that ... it is
extremely dangerous.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It is,' Custer said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I ... ah, see.' Tiborough cleared his throat, glanced up at the
colonel who was staring fixedly at Custer. The senator brought his
attention back to Custer.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Do you in fact have such a weapon with you, Mr Custer?'
Tiborough asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I have brought it as an exhibit, sir.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Exhibit?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes, sir.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Wallace rubbed his lips, found them dry. He wet them with his
tongue, wished for the water glass, but it was beyond Custer.
<EM>Christ! That stupid cowpuncher!</EM> He wondered if he dared
whisper to Custer. Would the senators and that Pentagon lackey
interpret such an action as meaning he was part of Custer's crazy
antics?</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Are you threatening this committee with your weapon, Mr
Custer?' Tiborough asked. 'If you are, I may say special
precautions have been taken ... extra guards in this room and we
... that is, we will not allow ourselves to worry too much about
any action you may take, but ordinary precautions are in

<P>Wallace could no longer sit quietly. He tugged Custer's sleeve,
got an abrupt shake of the head. He leaned close, whispered: 'We
could ask for a recess, Bill. Maybe we ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Don't interrupt me,' Custer said. He looked at Tiborough.
'Senator, I would not threaten you or any other man. Threats in the
way you mean them are a thing we no longer can indulge in.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You ... I believe you said this device is an exhibit,'
Tiborough said. He cast a worried frown at the report in his hands.
'I fail ... it does not appear germane.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Senator Plowers cleared his throat. 'Mr Chairman,' he said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The chair recognizes the senator from Nebraska,' Tiborough
said, and the relief in his voice was obvious. He wanted time to
think.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Mr Custer,' Plowers said, 'I have not seen the report, the
report my distinguished colleague alludes to; however, if I may ...
is it your wish to use this committee as some kind of publicity
device?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'By no means, Senator,' Custer said. 'I don't wish to profit by
my presence here ... not at all.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Tiborough had apparently come to a decision. He leaned back,
whispered to the colonel, who nodded and returned to the outer
hall.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You strike me as an eminently reasonable man, Mr Custer,'
Tiborough said. 'If I may ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'May I,' Senator Plowers said. 'May I, just permit me to
conclude this one point. May we have the Special Services report in
the record?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Certainly,' Tiborough said. 'But what I was about to
suggest.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'May I,' Plowers said. 'May I, would you permit me, please, Mr
Chairman, to make this point clear for the record?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Tiborough scowled, but the heavy dignity of the Senate overcame
his irritation. 'Please continue, Senator, I had thought you were
finished.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I respect ... there is no doubt in my mind of Mr Custer's
truthfulness,' Flowers said. His face eased into a grin that made
him look grandfatherly, a kindly elder statesman. 'I would like,
therefore, to have him explain how this ... ah, weapon, can be an
exhibit in the matter before our committee.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Wallace glanced at Custer, saw the hard set of the man's jaw,
realized the cattleman had gotten to Flowers somehow. This was a
set piece.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Tiborough was glancing at the other senators, weighing the
advisability of high-handed dismissal ... perhaps a star chamber
session. No ... they were all too curious about Custer's device,
his purpose here.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The thoughts were plain on the senator's face.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Very well,' Tiborough said. He nodded to Custer. 'You may
proceed, Mr Custer.'</P>

<P>'During last winter's slack season,' Custer said, 'two of my men
and I worked on a project we've had in the works for three years -
to develop a sustained-emission laser device.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Custer opened his briefcase, slid out a fat aluminium tube
mounted on a pistol grip with a conventional appearing trigger.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'This is quite harmless,' he said. 'I didn't bring the power
pack.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That is ... this is your weapon?' Tiborough asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Calling this a weapon is misleading,' Custer said. 'The term
limits and oversimplifies. This is also a brush-cutter, a
substitute for a logger's saw and axe, a diamond cutter, a milling
machine ... and a weapon. It is also a turning point in
history.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Come now, isn't that a bit pretentious?' Tiborough asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We tend to think of history as something old and slow,' Custer
said. 'But history is, as a matter of fact, extremely rapid and
immediate. A President is assassinated, a bomb explodes over a
city, a dam break, a revolutionary device is announced.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Lasers have been known for quite a few years,' Tiborough said.
He looked at the papers the colonel had given him. 'The principle
dates from 1956 or thereabouts.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I don't wish it to appear that I'm taking credit for inventing
this device,' Custer said. 'Nor am I claiming sole credit for
developing the sustained-emission laser. I was merely one of a
team. But I do hold the device here in my hand, gentlemen.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Exhibit, Mr Custer,' Flowers reminded him. 'How is this an
exhibit?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'May I explain first how it works?' Custer asked. 'That will
make the rest of my statement much easier.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Tiborough looked at Plowers, back to Custer. 'If you will tie
this all together, Mr Custer,' Tiborough said. 'I want to ... the
bearing of this device on our - we are hearing a particular bill in
this room.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Certainly, Senator,' Custer said. He looked at his device. 'A
ninety-volt radio battery drives this particular model. We have
some that require less voltage, some that use more. We aimed for a
construction with simple parts. Our crystals are common quartz. We
shattered them by bringing them to a boil in water and then
plunging them into ice water ... repeatedly. We chose twenty pieces
of very close to the same size - about one gram, slightly more than
fifteen grains each.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Custer unscrewed the back of the tube, slid out a round length
of plastic trailing lengths of red, green, brown, blue and yellow
wire.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Wallace noticed how the cameras of the TV men centered on the
object in Custer's hands. Even the senators were leaning forward,
staring.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>We're gadget crazy people,</EM> Wallace thought.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The crystals were dipped in thinned household cement and then
into iron filings,' Custer said. 'We made a little jig out of a
fly-tying vice and opened a passage in the filings at opposite ends
of the crystals. We then made some common celluloid -
nitrocellulose, acetic acid, gelatin and alcohol - all very common
products, and formed it in a length of garden hose just long enough
to take the crystals end to end. The crystals were inserted in the
hose, the celluloid poured over them and the whole thing was seated
in a magnetic waveguide while the celluloid was cooling. This
centered and aligned the crystals. The waveguide was constructed
from wire salvaged from an old TV set and built following the
directions in the Radio Amateur's Handbook.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Custer re-inserted the length of plastic into the tube, adjusted
the wires. There was an unearthly silence in the room with only the
cameras whirring. It was as though everyone were holding his
breath.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'A laser requires a resonant cavity, but that's complicated,'
Custer said. 'Instead, we wound two layers of fine copper wire
around our tube, immersed it in the celluloid solution to coat it
and then filed one end flat. This end took a piece of mirror cut to
fit. We then pressed a number eight embroidery needle at right
angles into the mirror end of the tub; until it touched the side of
the number one crystal.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Custer cleared his throat.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Two of the senators leaned back. Plowers coughed. Tiborough
glanced at the banks of TV cameras and there was a questioning look
in his eyes.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We then determined the master frequency of our crystal
series,'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Custer said. 'We used a test signal and oscilloscope, but any
radio amateur could do it without the oscilloscope. We constructed
an oscillator of that master frequency, attached it at the needle
and a bare spot scraped in the opposite edge of the waveguide.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And this ... ah ... worked?' Tiborough asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'No.' Custer shook his head. 'When we fed power through a
voltage multiplier into the system we produced an estimated four
hundred joules emission and melted half the tube. So we started all
over again.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You are going to tie this in?' Tiborough asked. He frowned at
the papers in his hands, glanced toward the door where the colonel
had gone.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I am, sir, believe me,' Custer said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Very well, then,' Tiborough said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'So we started all over,' Custer said. 'But for the second
celuloid dip we added bismuth - a saturate solution, actually. It
stayed gummy and we had to paint over it with a sealing coat of the
straight celluloid. We then coupled this bismuth layer through a
pulse circuit so that it was bathed in a counter wave -180 degrees
out of phase with the master frequency. We had, in effect, immersed
the unit in a thermoelectric cooler that exactly countered the heat
production. A thin beam issued from the unmirrored end when we
powered it. We have yet to find something that thin beam cannot
cut.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Diamonds?' Tiborough asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Powered by less than two hundred volts, this device could cut
our planet in half like a ripe tomato,' Custer said. 'One man could
destroy an aerial armada with it, knock down ICBMs before they
touched atmosphere, sink a fleet, pulverize a city. I'm afraid,
sir, that I haven't mentally catalogued all the violent
implications of this device. The mind tends to boggle at the
enormous power focused in ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Shut down those TV cameras!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>It was Tiborough shouting, leaping to his feet and making a
sweeping gesture to include the banks of cameras. The abrupt
violence of his voice and gesture fell on the room like an
explosion. 'Guards!' he called. 'You there at the door. Cordon off
that door and don't let anyone out who heard this fool!' He whirled
back to face Custer. 'You irresponsible idiot!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm afraid, Senator,' Custer said, 'that you're locking the
barn door many weeks too late.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>For a long minute of silence Tiborough glared at Custer. Then:
'You did this deliberately, eh?'</P>
<P> </P>

<P class="c1"><STRONG>Chapter III</STRONG></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Senator, if I'd waited any longer, there might have been no
hope for us at all.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Tiborough sat back into his chair, still keeping his attention
fastened on Custer. Flowers and Johnston on his right had their
heads close together whispering fiercely. The other senators were
dividing their attention between Custer and Tiborough, their eyes
wide and with no attempt to conceal their astonishment.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Wallace, growing conscious of the implications in what Custer
had said, tried to wet his lips with his tongue. <EM>Christ!</EM>
he thought. <EM>This stupid cowpoke has sold us all down the
river!</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>Tiborough signaled an aide, spoke briefly with him, beckoned the
colonel from the door. There was a buzzing of excited conversation
in the room. Several of the press and TV crew were huddled near the
windows on Custer's left, arguing. One of their number - a
florid-faced man with gray hair and horn-rimmed glasses, started
across the room toward Tiborough, was stopped by a committee aide.
They began a low-voiced argument with violent gestures.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A loud curse sounded from the door. Poxman, the syndicated
columnist, was trying to push past the guards there.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Poxman!' Tiborough called. The columnist turned. 'My orders are
that no one leaves,' Tiborough said. 'You are not an exception.' He
turned back to face Custer.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The room had fallen into a semblance of quiet, although there
still were pockets of muttering and there was the sound of running
feet and a hurrying about in the hall outside.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Two channels went out of here live,' Tiborough said. 'Nothing
much we can do about them, although we will trace down as many of
their viewers as we can. Every bit of film in this room and every
sound tape will be confiscated, however.' His voice rose as
protests sounded from the press section. 'Our national security is
at stake. The President has been notified. Such measures as are
necessary will be taken.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The colonel came hurrying into the room, crossed to Tiborough,
quietly said something.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You should've warned me!' Tiborough snapped. 'I had no idea
that ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The colonel interrupted with a whispered comment.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'These papers ... your damned report is <EM>not</EM> clear!'
Tiborough said. He looked around at Custer. 'I see you're smiling,
Mr Custer. I don't think you'll find much to smile about before
long.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Senator, this is not a happy-smile,' Custer said. 'But I told
myself several days ago you'd fail to see the implications of this
thing,' He tapped the pistol-shaped device he had rested on the
table. 'I told myself you'd fall back into the old, useless
pattern.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Is that what you told yourself, really?' Tiborough said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Wallace, hearing the venom in the senator's voice, moved his
chair a few inches farther away from Custer.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Tiborough looked at the laser projector. 'Is that thing really
disarmed?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes, sir.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'If I order one of my men to take it from you, you will not
resist?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Which of your men will you trust with it, Senator?' Custer
asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>In the long silence that followed, someone in the press section
emitted a nervous guffaw.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Virtually every man on my ranch has one of these things,'
Custer said. 'We fell trees with them, cut firewood, make fence
posts. Every letter written to me as a result of my patent
application has been answered candidly. More than a thousand sets
of schematics and instructions on how to build this device have
been sent out to varied places in the world.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You vicious traitor!' Tiborough rasped.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You're certainly entitled to your opinion, Senator,' Custer
said. 'But I warn you I've had time for considerably more
concentrated and considerably more painful thought than you've
applied to this problem. In my estimation, I had no choice. Every
week I waited to make this thing public, every day, every minute,
merely raised the odds that humanity would be destroyed by..:'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You said this thing applied to the hearings on the grazing
act,' Flowers protested, and there was a plaintive note of
complaint in his voice.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Senator, I told you the truth,' Custer said. 'There's no real
reason to change the act, now. We intend to go on operating under
it - with the agreement of our neighbors and others concerned.
People are still going to need food.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Tiborough glared at him. 'You're saying we can't force you to
...' He broke off at a disturbance in the doorway. A rope barrier
had been stretched there and a line of Marines stood with their
backs to it, facing the hall. A mob of people was trying to press
through. Press cards were being waved.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Colonel, I told you to clear that hall!' Tiborough barked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The colonel ran to the barrier. 'Use your bayonets if you have
to!' he shouted.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The disturbance subsided at the sound of his voice. More,
uniformed men could be seen moving in along the barrier. Presently,
the noise receded.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Tiborough turned back to Custer. 'You make Benedict Arnold look
like the greatest friend the United States ever had,' he said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Cursing me isn't going to help you,' Custer said. 'You are
going to have to live with this thing; so you'd better try
understanding it.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That appears to be simple,' Tiborough said. 'All I have to do
is send twenty-five cents to the Patent office for the schematics
and then write you a letter.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The world already was headed toward suicide,' Custer said.
'Only fools failed to realize ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'So you decided to give us a little push,' Tiborough said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'H. G. Wells warned us,' Custer said. 'That's how far back it
goes, but nobody listened. 'Human history becomes more and more a
race between education and catastrophe,' Wells said. 'But those
were just words. Many scientists have remarked the growth curve on
the amount of raw energy becoming available to humans - and the
diminishing curve on the number of persons required to use that
energy. For a long time now, more and more violent power was being
made available to fewer and fewer people. It was only a matter of
time until total destruction was put into the hands of single
individuals.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And you didn't think you could take your government into your
confidence.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The government already was committed to a political course
diametrically opposite the one this device requires,' Custer said,
'Virtually every man in the government has a vested interest in not
reversing that course.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'So you set yourself above the government?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm probably wasting my time,' Custer said, 'but I'll try to
explain it. Virtually every government in the world is dedicated to
manipulating something called the 'mass man'. That's how
governments have stayed in power. But there is no such man. When
you elevate the non-existent 'mass man' you degrade the individual.
And obviously it was only a matter of time until all of us were at
the mercy of the individual holding power.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You talk like a commie!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They'll say I'm a goddamn' capitalist pawn,' Custer said. 'Let
me ask you, Senator, to visualize a poor radio technician in a
South American country. Brazil, for example. He lives a
hand-to-mouth existence, ground down by an overbearing,
unimaginative, essentially uncouth ruling oligarchy. What is he
going to do when this device comes into his hands?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Murder, robbery and anarchy.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You could be right,' Custer said. 'But we might reach an
understanding out of ultimate necessity - that each of us must
cooperate in maintaining the dignity of all.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Tiborough stared at him, began to speak musingly: 'We'll have to
control the essential materials for constructing this thing ... and
there may be trouble for awhile, but ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You're a vicious fool.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>In the cold silence that followed, Custer said: 'It was too late
to try that ten years ago. I'm telling you this thing can be
patch-worked out of a wide variety of materials that are already
scattered over the earth. It can be made in basements and mud huts,
in palaces and shacks. The key item is the crystals, but other
crystals will work, too. That's obvious. A patient man can grow
crystals ... and this world is full of patient men.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm going to place you under arrest,' Tiborough said. 'You have
outraged every rule -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You're living in a dream world,' Custer said. 'I refuse to
threaten you, but I'll defend myself from any attempt to oppress or
degrade me. If I cannot defend myself, my friends will defend me.
No man who understands what this device means will permit his
dignity to be taken from him.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Custer allowed a moment for his words to sink in, then: 'And
don't twist those words to imply a threat. Refusal to threaten a
fellow human is an absolute requirement in the day that has just
dawned on us.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You haven't changed a thing!' Tiborough raged. 'If one man is
powerful with that thing, a hundred are ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'All previous insults aside,' Custer said, 'I think you are a
highly intelligent man, Senator. I ask you to think long and hard
about this device. Use of power is no longer the deciding factor
because one man is as powerful as a million. Restraint -
<EM>self</EM>-restraint is now the key to survival. Each of us is
at the mercy of his neighbor's good will. Each of us, Senator - the
man in the palace and the man in the shack. We'd better do all we
can to increase that good will - not attempting to buy it, but
simply recognizing that individual dignity is the one inalienable
right of ...'</P>
<P> </P>

'You're a living example of ...'</P>

<P>It was one of the TV cameramen in the left rear of the room.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Let's stop insulting Mr Custer and hear him out,' the cameraman
said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Get that man's name,' Tiborough told an aide. 'If he ...'</P>

<P>'I'm an expert electronic technician, Senator,' the man said.
'You can't threaten me now.'</P>

<P>'The revolution begins,' Custer said. He waved a hand as the
senator started to whirl away. 'Sit down, Senator.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Wallace, watching the senator obey, saw how the balance of
control had changed in this room.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ideas are in the wind,' Custer said. 'There comes a time for a
thing to develop. It comes into being. The spinning jenny came into
being because that was its time. It was based on countless ideas
that had preceded it.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And this is the age of the laser?' Tiborough asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It was bound to come,' Custer said. 'But the number of people
in the world who're filled with hate and frustration and violence
has been growing with terrible speed. You add to that the enormous
danger that this might fall into the hands of just one group or
nation or ...' Custer shrugged. 'This is too much power to be
confined to one man or group with the hope they'll administer
wisely. I didn't dare delay. That's why I spread this thing now and
announced it as broadly as I could.'</P>

<P>Tiborough leaned back in his chair, his hands in his lap. His
face was pale and beads of perspiration stood out on his
forehead.</P>

music has disrupted some valence of their reproductive cycle,' said
Dr Fladdis. 'At least, that's how we've translated their
explanation. This is the reason for the law prohibiting any traffic
in music devices.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm not a child!' snapped Laoconia. 'You don't have to explain
all ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We cannot be too careful,' said Dr Fladdis. 'With the memory of
Monligol still fresh in all minds.' He shuddered. 'We must return
to the spirit of the SocAnth motto: <EM>'For the Greater Good of
the Universe'</EM> We've been warned.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I don't see how music can be anything but a secondary
stimulant,' said Laoconia. 'However, I shall keep an open
mind.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Laoconia Wilkinson looked up from her notes, said: 'Marie, was
that a noise outside?' She pushed a strand of gray hair from her
forehead.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Marie Medill stood at the opposite side of the field hut,
staring out one of the two windows. 'I only hear the leaves,' she
said. 'They're awfully loud in that wind.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You're sure it wasn't Gafka?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Marie sighed and said, 'No, it wasn't his namesong.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Stop calling that monster a him!' snapped Laoconia.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Marie's shoulders stiffened.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Laoconia observed the reflex and thought how wise the Service
had been to put a mature, veteran anthropologist in command here. A
hex-dome hut was too small to confine brittle tempers. And the two
women had been confined here for 25 weeks already. Laoconia stared
at her companion - such a young romantic, that one.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Marie's pose reflected boredom ... worry ...</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Laoconia glanced around the hut's crowded interior.
Servo-recorders, night cameras, field computers, mealmech,
collapsible floaters, a desk, two chairs, folding bunks, three wall
sections taken up by the transceiver linking them with the mother
ship circling in satellite orbit overhead. Everything in its place
and a place for everything.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Somehow, I just can't help calling Gafka a him,' said Marie.
She shrugged. 'I know it's nonsense. Still ... when Gafka sings
...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Laoconia studied the younger woman. A blonde girl in a one-piece
green uniform; heavy peasant figure, good strong legs, an oval face
with high forehead and dreaming blue eyes.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Speaking of singing,' said Laoconia, 'I don't know what I shall
do if Gafka doesn't bring permission for us to attend their Big
Sing. We can't solve this mess without the facts.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'No doubt,' said Marie. She spoke snappishly, trying to keep her
attention away from Laoconia. The older woman just sat there. She
was always just sitting there - so efficient, so driving, a tall
gawk with windburned face, nose too big, mouth too big, chin too
big, eyes too small.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Marie turned away.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'With every day that passes I'm more convinced that this music
thing is a blind alley,' said Laoconia. 'The Rukuchp birthrate
keeps going down no matter how much of our music you teach
them.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But Gafka agrees,' protested Marie. 'Everything points to it.
Our discovery of this planet brought the Rukuchps into contact with
the first alien music they've ever known. Somehow, that's disrupted
their breeding cycle. I'm sure of it.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Breeding cycle,' sniffed Laoconia. 'For all we know, these
creatures could be ambulatory vegetables without even the most
rudimentary ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm so worried,' said Marie. 'It's music at the root of the
problem, I'm sure, but if it ever got out that we smuggled in those
education tapes and taught Gafka all our musical forms ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We did <EM>not</EM> smuggle anything!' barked Laoconia. 'The
law is quite clear. It only prohibits any form of mechanical
reproducer of actual musical sounds. Our tapes are all completely
visual.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I keep thinking of Monligol,' said Marie. 'I couldn't live with
the knowledge that I'd contributed to the extinction of a sentient
species. Even indirectly. If our <EM>foreign</EM> music really has
disrupted ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We don't even know if they breed!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But Gafka says ... '</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Gafka says! A dumb vegetable. Gafka says!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Not so dumb,' countered Marie. 'He learned to speak our
language in less than three weeks, but <EM>we</EM> have only the
barest rudiments of songspeech.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Gafka's an idiot-savant,' said Laoconia. 'And I'm not certain
I'd call what that creature does <EM>speaking.'</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It is too bad that you're tone deaf,' said Marie sweetly.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Laoconia frowned. She leveled a finger at Marie. 'The thing I
note is that we only have their word that their birthrate is
declining. They called on us for help, and now they obstruct every
attempt at field observation.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They're so shy,' said Marie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They're going to be shy one SocAnth field expedition if they
don't invite us to that Big Sing,' said Laoconia. 'Oh! If the
Council had only authorized a <EM>full</EM> field expedition with
armed support!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They couldn't!' protested Marie. 'After Monligol, practically
every sentient race in the universe is looking on Rukuchp as a
final test case. If we mess up another race with our meddling
...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Meddling!' barked Laoconia. 'Young woman, the Social
Anthropological Service is a holy calling! Erasing ignorance,
helping the backward races!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And we're the only judges of what's backward,' said Marie. 'How
convenient. Now, you take Monligol. Everyone knows that insects
carry disease. So we move in with our insecticides and kill off the
symbiotic partner essential to Monligolian reproduction. How
uplifting.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They should have told us,' said Laoconia.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They couldn't,' said Marie. 'It was a social taboo.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Well ...' Laoconia shrugged. 'That doesn't apply here.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'How do you know?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I've had enough of this silly argument,' barked Laoconia. 'See
if Gafka's coming. He's overdue.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Marie inhaled a trembling breath, stamped across to the field
hut's lone door and banged it open. Immediately the tinkle of
glaze-forest leaves grew louder. The wind brought an odor of
peppermint from the stubble plain to her left.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>She looked across the plain at the orange ball of Almac sinking
toward a flat horizon, swung her glance to the right where the wall
of the glazeforest loomed overhead. Rainbow-streaked batwing leaves
clashed in the wind, shifting in subtle competition for the last of
the day's orange light.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Do you see <EM>it?'</EM> demanded Laoconia.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Marie dropped her attention to the foot of the forest wall,
where stubble spikes crowded against great glasswood trunks.
'No.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What is keeping that creature?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Marie shook her head, setting blonde curls dancing across her
uniform collar. 'It'll be dark soon,' she said. 'He said he'd
return before it got fully dark.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Laoconia scowled, pushed aside her notes. <EM>Always calling it
a him! They're nothing but animated Easter eggs! If only ...</EM>
She broke the train of thought, attention caught by a distant
sound.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'There!' Marie peered down the length of glazeforest wall.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A fluting passage of melody hung on the air. It was the
meister-song of a delicate wind instrument. As they listened, the
tones deepened to an organ throb while a section of cello strings
held the melody. Glazeforest leaves began to tinkle in sympathetic
harmony. Slowly, the music faded.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It's Gafka,' whispered Marie. She cleared her throat, spoke
louder, self-consciously: 'He's coming out of the forest quite a
ways down.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I can't tell one from the other,' said Laoconia. 'They all look
alike and sound alike. Monsters.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They do look alike,' agreed Marie, 'but the sound is quite
individual.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Let's not harp on my tone deafness!' snapped Laoconia. She
joined Marie at the door. 'If they'll only let us attend their Sing
...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A six-foot Easter egg ambled toward them on four of its five
prehensile feet.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The crystal glistening of its vision cap, tipped slightly toward
the field hut, was semi-lidded by inner cloud-pigment in the
direction of the setting sun. Blue and white greeting colors edged
a great bellows muscle around the torso. The bell extension of a
mouth/ear - normally visible in a red-yellow body beneath the
vision cap - had been retracted to a multi-creased pucker.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What ugly brutes,' said Laoconia.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Shhhh!' said Marie. 'You don't know how far away he can hear
you.' She waved an arm. 'Gaaafkaa!' Then: 'Damn!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What's wrong?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I only made eight notes out of his name instead of nine.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gafka came up to the door, picking a way through the stubble
spikes. The orange mouth/ear extended, sang a 22-note harmonica
passage: 'Maarrriee Mmmmmmedillll.' Then a second concerto:
'Laoconnnnia Wiiilkinnnsonnnn.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'How lovely!' said Marie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I wish you'd talk straight out the way we taught you,' said
Laoconia. 'That singing is difficult to follow.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gafka's vision cap tipped toward her. The voice shifted to a
singsong waver: 'But polite sing greeting.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Of course,' said Laoconia. 'Now.' She took a deep breath. 'Do
we have permission to attend your Big Sing?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gafka's vision cap tipped toward Marie, back to Laoconia.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Please, Gafka?' said Marie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Difficulty,' wavered Gafka. 'Not know how say. Not have
knowledge your kind people. Is subject not want for talking.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I see,' said Laoconia, recognizing the metaphorical formula.
'It has to do with your breeding habits.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gafka's vision cap clouded over with milky pigment, a sign the
two women had come to recognize as embarrassment.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Now, Gafka,' said Laoconia. 'None of that. We've explained
about science and professional ethics, the desire to be of real
help to one another. You must understand that both Marie and I are
here for the good of your people.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A crystal moon unclouded in the part of the vision cap facing
Laoconia.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'If we could only get them to speak straight out,' said
Laoconia.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Marie said: 'Please, Gafka. We only want to help.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Understand I,' said Gafka. 'How else talk this I?' More of the
vision cap unclouded. 'But must ask question. Friends perhaps not
like.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We are scientists,' said Laoconia. 'You may ask any question
you wish.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You are too old for ... breeding?' asked Gafka. Again the
vision cap clouded over, sparing Gafka the sight of Laoconia
shocked speechless.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Marie stepped into the breech. 'Gafka! Your people and my people
are ... well, we're just too different. We couldn't. There's no way
... that is ... '</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Impossible!' barked Laoconia. 'Are you implying that we might
be sexually attacked if we attended your Big Sing?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gafka's vision cap unclouded, tipped toward Laoconia. Purple
color bands ran up and down the bellows muscle, a sign of
confusion.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Not understand I about sex thing,' said Gafka. 'My people never
hurt other creature.' The purple bands slowed their upward-downward
chasing, relaxed into an indecisive green. The vision cap tipped
toward Marie. 'Is true all life kinds start egg young same?' This
time the clouding of the vision cap was only a momentary
glimmerwhite.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Essentially, that is so,' agreed Laoconia. 'We all <EM>do</EM>
start with an egg. However, the fertilization process is different
with different peoples.' Aside to Marie, she said: 'Make a note of
that point about eggs. It bears out that they may be oviparian as I
suspected.' Then: 'Now, I must know what you meant by your
question.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gafka's vision cap rocked left, right, settled on a point
between the two women. The sing-song voice intoned: 'Not understand
I about different ways. But know I you see many thing my people not
see. If breeding (glimmerwhite) different, or you too old for
breeding (glimmerwhite) my people say you come Big Sing. Not want
we make embarrass for you.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We are scientists,' said Laoconia. 'It's quite all right. Now,
may we bring our cameras and recording equipment?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Bring you much of things?' asked Gafka.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We'll only be taking one large floater to carry our equipment,'
said Laoconia. 'How long must we be prepared to stay?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'One night,' said Gafka. 'I bring worker friends to help with
floater. Go I now. Soon be dark. Come moonrise I return, take to
Big Sing place you.' The trumpet mouth fluted three minor notes of
farewell, pulled back to an orange pucker. Gafka turned, glided
into the forest. Soon he had vanished among reflections of
glass-wood boles.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'A break at last!' barked Laoconia. She strode into the hut,
speaking over her shoulder. 'Call the ship. Have them monitor our
equipment. Tell them to get duplicate recordings. While we're
starting to analyze the sound-sight record down here they can be
transmitting a copy to the master computers at Kampichi. We want as
many minds on this as possible. We may never get another chance
like this one!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Marie said: 'I don't -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Snap to it!' barked Laoconia.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Shall I talk to Dr Baxter?' asked Marie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Talk to Helen?' demanded Laoconia. 'Why would you want to
bother Helen with a routine question like this?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I just want to discuss ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That transceiver is for official use only,' said Laoconia.
Transmit the message as I've directed. We're here to solve the
Rukuchp breeding problem, not to chit-chat.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I feel suddenly so uneasy,' said Marie. 'There's something
about this situation that worries me.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Uneasy?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I think we've missed the point of Gafka's warning.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Stop worrying,' said Laoconia. 'The natives won't give us any
trouble. Gafka was looking for a last excuse to keep us from
attending their Big Sing. You've seen how stupidly shy they
are.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But what if -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I've had a great deal of experience in handling native
peoples,' said Laoconia. 'You never have trouble as long as you
keep a firm, calm grip on the situation at all times.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Maybe so. But ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Think of it!' said Laoconia. 'The first humans ever to attend a
Rukuchp Big Sing. Unique! You mustn't let the magnitude of our
achievement dull your mind. Stay cool and detached as I do. Now get
that call off to the ship!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>It was a circular clearing perhaps two kilometers in diameter,
dark with moonshadows under the giant glaze trees. High up around
the rim of the clearing, moonlight painted prismatic rainbows along
every leaf edge. A glint of silver far above the center of the open
area betrayed the presence of a tiny remote-control floater
carrying night cameras and microphones.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Except for a space near the forest edge occupied by Laoconia and
Marie, the clearing was packed with silent shadowy humps of Rukuchp
natives. Vision caps glinted like inverted bowls in the
moonlight.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Seated on a portable chair beside the big pack-floater, Laoconia
adjusted the position of the tiny remote unit high above them. In
the monitor screen before her she could see what the floater lenses
covered - the clearing with its sequin glitter of Rukuchp vision
caps and the faintest gleam of red and green instrument lights
between herself and Marie seated on the other side of the floater.
Marie was monitoring the night lenses that would make the scene
appear as bright as day on the recording wire.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Marie straightened, rubbed the small of her back. 'This clearing
must be at least two kilometers across,' she whispered,
impressed.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Laoconia adjusted her earphones, tested a relay. Her feet ached.
It had been at least a four-hour walk in here to this clearing. She
began to feel latent qualms about what might be ahead in the nine
hours left of the Rukuchp night. That stupid warning ...</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I said it's a big clearing,' whispered Marie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Laoconia cast an apprehensive glance at the silent Rukuchp
figures packed closely around. 'I didn't realize there'd be so
many,' she whispered. 'It doesn't look to me as though they're
dying out. What does your monitor screen show?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They fill the clearing,' whispered Marie. 'And I think they
extend back under the trees. I wish I knew which one was Gafka. I
should've watched when he left us.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Didn't he say where he was going?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'He just asked if this spot was all right for us and if we were
ready to help them.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Well, I'm sure everything's going to be all right,' said
Laoconia. She didn't sound very convincing, even to herself.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Isn't it time to contact the ship?' asked Marie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They'll be calling any -' A light flashed red on the panel in
front of Laoconia. 'Here they are now.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>She flipped a switch, spoke into her cheek microphone.
'Yes?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The metallic chattering in Laoconia's earphones only made Marie
feel more lonely. The ship was so far away above them.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That's right,' said Laoconia. 'Transmit your record immediately
and ask Kampichi to make an independent study. We'll compare notes
later.' Silence while she listened, then: 'I'm sure there's no
danger. You can keep an eye on us through the overhead lenses. But
there's never been a report of a Rukuchp native offering violence
to anyone ... Well, I don't see what we can do about it now. We're
here and that's that. I'm signing off now.' She flipped the
switch.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Was that Dr Baxter?' asked Marie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes. Helen's monitoring us herself, though I don't see what she
can do. Medical people are very peculiar sometimes. Has the
situation changed with the natives?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They haven't moved that I can see.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Why couldn't Gafka have given us a preliminary briefing?' asked
Laoconia. 'I detest this flying blind.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I think it still embarrasses him to talk about breeding,' said
Marie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Everything's too quiet,' hissed Laoconia. 'I don't like
it.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They're sure to do something soon,' whispered Marie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>As though her words were the signal, an almost inaudible
vibration began to throb in the clearing. Glaze leaves started
their sympathetic tinkle-chiming. The vibration grew, became an
organ rumble with abrupt piping obbligato that danced along its
edges. A cello insertion pulled a melody from the sound, swung it
over the clearing while the glazeforest chimed louder and
louder.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'How exquisite,' breathed Marie. She forced her attention onto
the instruments in front of her. Everything was functioning.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The melody broke to a single clear high note of harmonic
brilliance - a flute sound that shifted to a second phase with
expanded orchestration. The music picked up element after element
while low-register tympani built a stately rhythm into it, and
zither tinkles laid a counter-point on the rhythm.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Pay attention to your instruments,' hissed Laoconia.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Marie nodded, swallowing. The music was like a song heard
before, but never before played with this perfection. She wanted to
close her eyes; she wanted to submit entirely to the ecstasy of
sound.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Around them, the Rukuchp natives remained stationary, a rhythmic
expansion and contraction of bellows muscles their only
movement.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>And the rapture of music intensified.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Marie moved her head from side to side, mouth open. The sound
was an infinity of angel choirs - every sublimity of music ever
conceived - now concentrated into one exquisite distillation. She
felt that it could not possibly grow more beautiful.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>But it did.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>There came a lifting-expanding-floating ... a long gliding
suspenseful timelessness.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Silence.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Marie felt herself drifting back to awareness, found her hands
limply fumbling with dials. Some element of habit assured her that
she had carried out her part of the job, but that music ... She
shivered.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They sang for 47 minutes,' hissed Laoconia. She glanced around.
'Now what happens?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Marie rubbed her throat, forced her attention onto the luminous
dials, the floater, the clearing. A suspicion was forming in the
back of her mind.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I wish I knew which one of these creatures was Gafka,'
whispered Laoconia. 'Do we dare arouse one of them, ask after
Gafka?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We'd better not,' said Marie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'These creatures did nothing but sing,' said Laoconia. 'I'm more
certain than ever that the music is stimulative and nothing
more.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I hope you're right,' whispered Marie. Her suspicion was taking
on more definite shape ... <EM>music, controlled sound, ecstasy of
controlled sound ...</EM> Thoughts tumbled over each other
<EM>in</EM> her mind.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Time dragged out in silence.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What do you suppose they're doing?' hissed Laoconia. 'They've
been sitting like this for 25 minutes.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Marie glanced around at the ring of Rukuchp natives hemming in
the little open space, black mounds topped by dim silver. The
stillness was like a charged vacuum.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>More time passed.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Forty minutes!' whispered Laoconia. 'Do they expect us to sit
here all night?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Marie chewed her lower lip. <EM>Ecstasy of sound,</EM> she
thought. And she thought of sea urchins and the parthenogenetic
rabbits of Calibeau.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A stirring movement passed through the Rukuchp ranks. Presently,
shadowy forms began moving away into the glaze-forest's
blackness.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Where are they going?' hissed Laoconia. 'Do you see Gafka?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'No.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The transmission-receive light flashed in front of Laoconia. She
flipped the switch, pressed an earphone against her head. 'They
just seem to be leaving,' she whispered into the cheek microphone.
'You see the same thing we do. There's been no movement against us.
Let me call you back later. I want to observe this.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A Rukuchp figure came up beside Marie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Gafka?' said Marie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Gafka,' intoned the figure. The voice sounded sleepy.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Laoconia leaned across the instrument-packed floater. 'What are
they doing now, Gafka?' she demanded.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'All new song we make from music you give,' said Gafka.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Is the sing all ended?' asked Marie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Same,' breathed Gafka.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What's this about a new song?' demanded Laoconia.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Not have your kind song before correct,' said Gafka. 'In it too
much new. Not understand we how song make you. But now you teach,
make right you.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What is all this nonsense?' asked Laoconia. 'Gafka, where are
your people all going?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Going,' sighed Gafka.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Laoconia looked around her. 'But they're departing singly ... or
... well, there don't seem to be any mated pairs. What <EM>are</EM>
they doing?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Go each to wait,' said Gafka.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>And Marie thought of caryocinesis and daughter nuclei.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I don't understand,' complained Laoconia.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You teach how new song sing,' sighed Gafka. 'New song best all
time. We keep this song. Better much than old song. Make better -'
the women detected the faint glimmer-haze lidding of Gafka's vision
cap - 'make better young. Strong more.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Gafka,' said Marie, 'is the song all you do? I mean, there
isn't anything else?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'All,' breathed Gafka. 'Best song ever.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Laoconia said: 'I think we'd better follow some of these
...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That's not necessary,' said Marie. 'Did you enjoy their music
Dr Wilkinson?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Well ...' There appeared to be embarrassment in the way the
older woman turned her head away. 'It was <EM>very</EM>
beautiful.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And you <EM>enjoyed</EM> it?' persisted Marie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I don't see what ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You're tone deaf,' said Marie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It's obviously a stimulant of some sort!' snapped Laoconia. 'I
don't understand now why they won't let us ... '</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They let us,' said Marie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Laoconia turned to Gafka. 'I must insist, Gafka, that we be
permitted to study all phases of your breeding process. Otherwise
we can be of no help to you.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You best help ever,' said Gafka. 'Birthrate all good now. You
teach way out from mixing of music.' A shudder passed upward
through Gafka's bellows muscles.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Do you make sense out of this?' demanded Laoconia.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm afraid I do,' said Marie. 'Aren't you tired, Gafka?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Same,' sighed Gafka.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Laoconia, Dr Wilkinson, we'd better get back to the hut,' said
Marie. 'We can improvise what we'll need for the Schafter
test.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But the Schafter's for determining <EM>human</EM> pregnancy!'
protested Laoconia.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The red light glowed in front of Laoconia. She flipped the
switch. 'Yes?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Scratching sounds from the earphones broke the silence. Marie
felt that she did not want to hear the voice from the ship.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Laoconia said: 'Of course I know you're monitoring the test of
... Why should I tell Marie you've already given Schafter tests to
yourself ...' Laoconia's voice climbed. 'WHAT? You can't be ser ...
That's impossible! But, Helen, we ... they ... you ... we ... Of
course! ... Where could we have ... Every woman on the ship
...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>There was a long silence while Marie watched Laoconia listening
to the earphones, nodding. Presently, Laoconia lifted the earphones
off her head and put them down gently. Her voice came out
listlessly. 'Dr Bax ... Helen suspected that ... she administered
Schafter tests to herself and some of the others.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'She listened to that music?' asked Marie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The whole universe listened to that music,' said Laoconia.
'Some smuggler monitored the ship's official transmission of our
recordings. Rebroadcast stations took it. Everyone's going crazy
about our <EM>beautiful</EM> music.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh. no,' breathed Marie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Laoconia said: 'Everyone on the ship listened to our recordings.
Helen said she suspected immediately after the broadcast, but she
waited the full half hour before giving the Schafter test.'
Laoconia glanced at the silent hump of Gafka standing beside Marie.
'Every woman on that ship who could become pregnant is
pregnant.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It's obvious, isn't it?' asked Marie. 'Gafka's people have
developed a form of group parthenogenesis. Their Big Sing sets off
the blastomeric reaction.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But we're humans!' protested Laoconia. 'How can ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And parts of us are still very primitive,' said Marie. 'This
shouldn't surprise us. Sound's been used before to induce the first
mitotic cleavage in an egg. Gafka's people merely have this as
their sole breeding method - with corresponding perfection of
technique.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Laoconia blinked, said: 'I wonder how this ever got
started?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And when they first encountered our <EM>foreign</EM> music,'
said Marie, 'it confused them, mixed up their musical
relationships. They were fascinated by the new musical forms. They
experimented for new sensations ... and their birthrate fell off.
Naturally.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Then you came along,' said Laoconia, 'and taught them how to
master the new music.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Exactly.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Marie!' hissed Laoconia.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We were right here during that entire ... You don't suppose
that we ... that I ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I don't know about you,' said Marie, 'but I've never felt more
certain of anything in my life.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>She chewed at her lower lip, fought back tears. 'I'm going to
have a baby. Female. It'll have only half the normal number of
chromosomes. And it'll be sterile. And I ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Say I to you,' chanted Gafka. There was an air of sadness in
the singsong voice. 'Say I to you: all life kinds start egg young
same. Not want I to cause troubles. But you say different you.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Parthenogenesis,' said Laoconia with a show of her old energy.
'That means, of course, that the human reproductive process need
not ... that is, uh ... we'll not have to ... I mean to say that
men won't be ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The babies will be drones.' said Marie. 'You know that.
Unfertile drones. This may have its vogue, but it surely can't
last.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Perhaps,' said Laoconia. 'But I keep thinking of all those
re-broadcasts of our recordings. I wonder if these Rukuchp
creatures ever had two sexes?' She turned toward Gafka. 'Gafka, do
you know if ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Sorry cause troubles,' intoned Gafka. The singsong voice
sounded weaker. 'Must say farewell now. Time for birthing me.'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>'You</EM> are going to give birth?' asked Laoconia.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Same.' breathed Gafka. 'Feel pain on eye-top.' Gafka's
prehensile legs went into a flurry of digging in the ground beside
the floater.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Well, you were right about one thing, Dr Wilkinson,' said
Marie. 'She-he is not a <EM>him.'</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gafka's legs bent, lowered the ovoid body into the freshly dug
concavity in the ground. Immediately, the legs began to shrink back
into the body. A crack appeared across the vision cap, struck
vertically down through the bellows muscles.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Presently, there were two Gafkas, each half the size of the
original. As the women watched, the two half-sized Gafkas began
extruding new legs to regain the normal symmetry.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh, no,' whispered Marie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>She had a headache.</P>

<P class="c1"><STRONG>Escape Felicity</STRONG></P>
<H3 class="c3">By Frank Herbert, 1966</H3>
<P class="c1"> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'An escape-proof prison cannot be built,' he kept telling
himself. His name was Roger Beirut, five feet tall, one hundred and
three pounds, crewcut black hair, a narrow face with a long nose
and wide mouth and space-bleached eyes that appeared to reflect
rather than absorb what they saw.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut knew his prison - the D-Service. He had got himself
rooted down in the Service like a remittance man half asleep in a
hammock on some palm-shaded tropical beach, telling himself his
luck would change some day and he'd get out of there.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He didn't delude himself that a one-man D-ship was a hammock, or
that space was a tropical beach. But the sinecure element was there
and the ships were solicitous cocoons, each with a climate designed
precisely for the lone occupant.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>That each pilot carried the prison's bars in his mind had taken
Beirut a long time to understand. Out here aimed into the void
beyond Capella Base, he could feel the bars where they had been dug
into his psyche, cemented and welded there. He blamed the operators
of Bu-psych and the deep-sleep hypnotic debriefing after each
search trip. He told himself that Bu-psych did something to the
helpless pilots then installed this compulsion they called the
<EM>Push.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>Some young pilots managed to escape it for a while - tougher
psyches, probably, but sooner or later, Bu-psych got them all. It
was a common compulsion that limited the time a D-ship pilot could
stay out before he turned tail and fled for home.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'This time I'll break away,' Beirut told himself. He knew he was
talking aloud, but he had his computer's vocoders turned off and
his absent mumblings would be ignored.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The gas cloud of Grand Nuage loomed ahead of him, clearly
defined on his instruments like a piece of torn fabric thrown
across the stars. He'd come out of subspace dangerously close, but
that was the gamble he'd taken.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Bingaling Benar, fellow pilot and sometime friend, had called
him nuts when Beirut had said he was going to tackle the cloud.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Didn't you do that once before?' Bingaling asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I was going to once, but I changed my mind,' Beirut had
said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You gotta slow down, practically crawl in there,' Bingaling had
said. 'I stood it in eighty-one days, man. I had the push for real
- couldn't take any more and I came home. Anyway, it's nothing but
cloud all the way through.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Bingaling's <EM>endless</EM> cloud was growing larger in the
ship's instruments now. But the cloud enclosed a mass of space that
could hide a thousand suns.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Eighty-one days,</EM> he thought.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Eighty, ninety days, that's all anyone can take out there,'
Bingaling had said. 'And I'm telling you, in that cloud it's worse.
You get the push practically the minute you go in.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut had his ship down to a safe speed now, nosing into the
first tenuous layers. There was no mystery about the cloud's
composition, he reminded himself. It was hydrogen, but in a
concentration that made swift flight suicidal.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They got this theory,' Bingaling had said, 'that it's an embryo
star like. One day it's just going to go fwoosh and compress down
into one star mass.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut eased the controls. He could sense his ship around him
like an extension of his own nerves. She was a pinnacle class for
which he and his fellow pilots had a simple and obscene nickname -
two hundred and fifty meters long, crowded from nose to tubes with
the equipment for determining if a planet could support human life.
In the sleep-freeze compartment directly behind him were the
double-checks - two pairs of rhesus monkeys and ten pairs of white
mice.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>D-ship pilots contended they'd seeded more planets with rhesus
monkeys and white mice than they had with humans.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut switched to his stern instruments. One hour into the
cloud and already the familiar stars behind him were beginning to
fuzz off. He felt the first stirrings of unease; not the push ...
but disquiet.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He crossed his arms, touching the question-mark insignia at his
left shoulder. He could feel the ripe green film of corrosion on
the brass threads. <EM>I should polish up,</EM> he thought. But he
knew he wouldn't. He looked around him at the pilot compartment,
seeing unracked food cannisters, a grease smear across the computer
console, dirty fatigues wadded under a dolly seat.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>It was a sloppy ship.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut knew what was said about him and his fellow pilots back
in the top echelons of the D-Service.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Rogues make the best searchers.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>It was an axiom, but the rogues had their drawbacks. They
flouted rules, sneered at protocol, ignored timetables, laughed at
vector search plans ... and kept sloppy ships. And when they
disappeared - as they often did - the Service could never be sure
what had happened or where.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Except that the man had been prevented from returning ...
because there was always the push.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut shook his head. Every thought seemed to come back to the
push. He didn't have it yet, he assured himself. Too soon. But the
thought was there, aroused. It was the fault of that cloud.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He re-activated the rear scanners. The familiar stars were gone,
swallowed in a blanket of nothingness. Angrily, he turned off the
scanner switch.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>I've got to keep busy,</EM> he thought.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>For a time he set himself to composing and refining a new stanza
for the endless D-ship ballad: 'I Left My Love On Lyra In The Hands
Of Gentle Friends.' But his mind kept returning to the fact that
the stanza might never be heard ... if his plans succeeded. He
wondered then how many such stanzas had been composed never to be
heard.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The days went by with an ever-slowing, dragging monotony.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Eighty-one days,</EM> he reminded himself time and again.
<EM>Bingaling turned back at eighty-one days.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>By the seventy-ninth day he could see why. There was no doubt
then that he was feeling the first ungentle suasions of the push.
His mind kept searching for logical reasons.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>You've done your best. No shame in turning back now.
Bingaling's undoubtedly right - it's nothing but cloud all the way
through. No stars in here</EM> ... no <EM>planets.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>But he was certain what the Bu-psych people had done to him and
this helped. He watched the forward scanners for the first sign of
a glow. And this helped, too. He was still going some place.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The eighty-first day passed.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The eighty-second.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>On the eighty-sixth day he began to see a triple glow ahead -
like lights through fog; only the fog was black and otherwise
empty.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>By this time it was taking a conscious effort to keep his hands
from straying toward the flip-flop controls that would turn the
ship one hundred eighty degrees onto its return track.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Three lights in the emptiness.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ninety-four days - two days longer than he'd ever withstood the
push before - and his ship swam free of the cloud into open space
with three stars lined out at a one o'clock angle ahead of him - a
distant white-blue giant, a nearby orange dwarf and in the center
... a lovely golden sol-type to the fifth decimal of
comparison.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Feverishly, Beirut activated his mass-anomaly scanners, probing
space around the golden-yellow sun.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The push was terrible now, insisting that he turn around. But
this was the final convincer for Beirut . If the thing Bu-psych had
done to him insisted he go back now, right after discovering three
new suns - then there could be only one answer to the question
'Why?' They didn't want a B-Service rogue settling down on his own
world. The push was a built-in safeguard to make sure the scout
returned.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut forced himself to study his instruments.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Presently, the golden star gave up its secret - a single planet
with a single moon. He punched for first approximation, watched the
results stutter off the feedout tape: planetary mass .998421 of
Earth norm ... rotation forty plus standard hours ... mean orbital
distance 243 million kilometers ... perturbation nine degrees ...
orbital variation thirty-eight plus.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut sat bolt upright with surprise.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Thirty-eight plus! A variation percentage in that range could
only mean the mother star had another companion - and a big one. He
searched space around the star.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Nothing.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Then he saw it.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>At first he thought he'd spotted the drive flare of another ship
- an alien. He swallowed, the push momentarily subdued, and did a
quick mental review of the alien-space contact routine worked out
by Earth's bigdomes and which, so far as anyone knew, had never
been put to the test.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The flare grew until it resolved itself into the gaseous glow of
another astronomical body circling the golden sun.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Again, Beirut bent to his instruments. My God, how the thing
moved! More than forty kilometers per second. Tape began spewing
from the feedout: Mass 321.64 ... rotation nine standard hours ...
mean orbital distance 58 million kilometers ... perturbation blank
(insufficient data) ...</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut shifted to the filtered visual scanners, watched the
companion sweep across the face of its star and curve out of sight
around the other side. The thing looked oddly familiar, but he knew
he could never have seen it before. He wondered if he should
activate the computer's vocoder system and talk to it through the
speaker embedded in his neck, but the computer annoyed him with its
obscene logic.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The astronomical data went into the banks, though, for the
experts to whistle and marvel over later.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut shifted his scanners back to the planet. Shadowline
measurement gave it an atmosphere that reached fade-off at an
altitude of about a hundred and twenty-five kilometers. The
radiation index indicated a whopping tropical belt, almost sixty
degrees.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>With a shock of awareness, Beirut found his hands groping toward
the flip-flop controls. He jerked back, trembling. If he once
turned the ship over, he knew he wouldn't have the strength of
purpose to bring her back around. The push had reached terrifying
intensity.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut forced his attention onto the landing problem, began
feeding data into the computer for the shortest possible
space-to-ground course. The computer offered a few objections 'for
his own good,' but he insisted. Presently, a landing tape appeared
and he fed it into the control console, strapped down, kicked the
ship onto automatic and sat back perspiring. His hands held a death
grip on the sides of his crash-pad.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The B-ship began to buck with the first skipping-flat entrance
into the planet's atmosphere. The bucking stopped, returned,
stopped - was repeated many times. The B-ship's cooling system
whined. Hull plates creaked. Darkside, lightside, darkside - they
repeated themselves in his viewer. The automatic equipment began
reeling out atmospheric data: oxygen 23.9, nitrogen 74.8, argon
0.8, carbon dioxide 0.04 ... By the time it got into the trace
elements, Beirut was gasping with the similarity to the atmosphere
of Mother Earth.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The spectrum analyzer produced the datum that the atmosphere was
essentially transparent from 3,000 angstroms to 6 X 10<SUP>4</SUP>
angstroms. It was a confirmation and he ignored the instruments
when they began producing hydromagnetic data and water vapor
impingements. There was only one important fact here: he could
breathe the stuff out there.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Instead of filling him with a sense of joyful discovery - as it
might have thirty or forty days earlier - this turned on a new
spasm of the push. He had to consciously restrain himself from
clawing at the instrument panel.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut's teeth began to chatter.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The viewer showed him an island appearing over the horizon. The
B-ship swept over it. Beirut gasped at sight of an alabaster ring
of tall buildings hugging the curve of a bay. Bots on the water
resolved into sailboats as he neared. How oddly familiar it all
looked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Then he was past and headed for a mainland with a low range of
hills - more buildings, roads, the patchwork of fenced lands. Then
he was over a wide range of prairie with herds of moving animals on
it.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut's fingers curled into claws. His skin trembled.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The landing jets cut in and his seat reversed itself. The ship
nosed up and the seat adjusted to the new attitude. There came a
roaring as the ship lowered itself on its tail jets. The proximity
cut-off killed all engines.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The B-ship settled with a slight jolt.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Blue smoke and clouds of whirling ashes lifted past Beirut's
scanners from the scorched landing circle. Orange flames swept
through dry forage on his right, but the chemical automatics from
the ship's nose sent a borate shower onto the fire and extinguished
it. Beirut saw the backs of animals fleeing through the smoke haze
beyond the fire. Amplification showed them to be four-legged,
furred and with tiny flat heads. They ran like bouncing balls. A
light band of fear cinched on Beirut's chest. This place was too
earthlike. His teeth chattered with the unconscious demands of the
push.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>His instruments informed him they were picking up modulated
radio signals - FM and AM. A light showing that the
Probe-Test-Watch circuits were activated came alive. Computer
response circuit telltales began flickering. Abruptly, the P-T-W
bell rang, telling him: 'Something approaches!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The viewer showed a self-propelled vehicle rolling over a low
hill to the north supported by what appeared to be five monstrous
pneumatic bladders. It headed directly toward the B-ship belching
pale white smoke from a rear stack with the rhythm of steam power.
External microphones picked up the confirming 'chuff-chuff-chuff'
an' his computer announced that it was a double-action engine with
sounds that indicated five opposed pairs of pistons.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A five-sided dun brown cab with dark blue-violet windows
overhung the front of the thing.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>In his fascination with the machine, Beirut almost forgot the
wild urge pushing at him from within. The machine pulled up about
fifty meters beyond the charred landing circle, extruded a muzzle
that belched a puff of smoke at him. The external microphones
picked up a loud explosion and the D-ship rocked on its extended
tripods.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut clutched the arms of his chair then sprang to the
controls of the ship's automatic defenses, poised a hand over the
disconnect switch.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The crawling device outside whirled away, headed east toward a
herd of the bouncing animals.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut punched the 'Warning-Only' button.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A giant gout of earth leaped up ahead of the crawler, brought it
to a lurching halt at the brink of a smoking hole. Another gout of
earth bounced skyward at the left of the machine; another at the
right.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut punched 'Standby' on the defense mechanisms, turned to
assess the damage. Any new threat from the machine out there and
the B-ship's formidable arsenal would blast it out of existence.
That was always a step to be avoided, though, and he kept one eye
on the screen showing the thing out there. It sat unmoving but
still chuffing on the small patch of earth left by the three
blast-shots from the ship.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Less than ten seconds later, the computer out-chewed a strip of
tape that said the ship's nose section had been blasted open, all
proximity detectors destroyed. Beirut was down on this planet until
he could make repairs.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Oddly, this eased the pressures of the push within him. It was
still there and he could sense it, but the compulsive drive lay
temporarily idle as though it, top, had a standby switch.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut returned his attention to the crawler.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The damage had been done, and there was no helping it. A ship
could land with its arsenal set on 'Destroy,' but deciding what
needed destruction was a delicate proposition. Wise counsel said
you let the other side get in a first shot if their technology
appeared sufficiently primitive. Otherwise, you might make yourself
decidedly unwelcome.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Who'd have thought they'd have a cannon and fire the thing
without warning?</EM> he asked himself. And the reply stood there
accusingly in his mind: <EM>You should've thought of it, stupid.
Gunpowder and steam-power are almost always concurrent.</EM></P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Well, I was too upset by the push,</EM> he thought.
<EM>Besides, why'd they fire without warning?</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Again, the crawler's cab extruded the cannon muzzle and the cab
started to turn to bring the weapon to bear on the ship. A warning
blast sent earth cascading into the hole at the left of the
crawler. The cab stopped turning.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That's-a-baby,' Beirut said. 'Easy does it, fellows. Let's be
friends.' He nicked a blue switch at the left side of his board.
His external microphones damped out as a klaxon sent its bull roar
toward the crawler. It was a special sound capable of intimidating
almost any creature that heard it. The sound had an astonishing
effect on the crawler. A hatch in the middle of the cab popped open
and five creatures boiled out of it to stand on the deck of their
machine.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut keyed the microphone beside him into the central
computer, raised amplification on his view of the five creatures
from the machine. He began reading off his own reactions. The human
assessment always helped the computer's sensors.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Humanoid,' he said. 'Upright tubular bodies about a meter and a
half tall with two legs encased in some kind of boot. Sack-like
garments belted at the waist. Each has five pouches dangling from
the belt. Number five is significant here. Flesh color is pale
blue-violet. Two arms; articulation - humanoid, but very long
forearm. Wide hands with six fingers; looks like two opposable
thumbs, one to each side of the hand. Heads - squarish, domed,
covered with what appears to be a dark blue-violet beret. Eyes
semi-stalked, yellow and just inside the front <EM>corners</EM> of
the head. Those heads are very blocky. I suspect the eyes can be
twisted to look behind without turning the head.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The creatures began climbing down off their machine. Beirut went
on with his description: 'Large mouth orifice centered beneath the
eyes. There appears to be a chin articulation on a short hinge.
Orifice lipless, ovoid, no apparent teeth ... correction: there's a
dark line inside that may be the local equivalent. Separate small
orifices below each eye stalk - possibly for breathing. One just
turned its head. I see a slight indentation centered on the side of
the head - purpose unknown. It doesn't appear to be an ear.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The five were advancing on the ship now; Beirut backed off the
scanner to keep them in view, said: 'They carry bows and arrows.
That's odd, considering the cannon. Each has a back quiver with ...
five arrows. That five again. Bows slung on the string over left
shoulder. Each has a short lance in a back harness, a blue-violet
pennant just below the lance head. Some kind of figure on the
pennant - looks like an upside down 'U' in orange. Same figure
repeated on the front of their tunics which are also blue-violet.
Blue-violet and five. What's the prognosis?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut waited for the computer's answer to come to him through
the speaker grafted into his neck. Relays clicked and the vocoder
whispered through the bones of his head: 'Probable religious
association with color and number five. Extreme caution is
indicated on religious matters. Body armor and hand weapon
mandatory.'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>That's the trouble with computers,</EM> Beirut thought.
<EM>Too logical.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>The five natives had stopped just outside the fire-blackened
landing circle. They raised their arms to the ship, chanted
something that sounded like 'Toogayala-toogayala-toogayala.' The
sound came from the oval central orifice.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We'll toogayala in just a minute,' Beirut muttered. He brought
out a Borgen machine pistol, donned body armor, aimed two of the
ship's bombards directly at the steam wagon and set them on a
dead-man switch keyed to a fifteen-second stoppage of his heart. He
rigged the stern port to the PTW syslem, keyed to blow up any
unauthorized intruders. Into various pockets he stuffed a lingua
pack receptor tuned to his implanted speaker through the computer,
a standard contact kit for sampling whatever interested him, a half
dozen minigrenades, energy tablets, food analyzer, a throwing knife
in a sheath, a miniscanner linked to the shipcomputer and a
slingshot. With a final, grim sensation, he stuffed a medikit under
the armor next to his heart.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>One more glance around the familiar control center and he slid
down the tube to the stern port, opened it and stepped out.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The five natives threw themselves flat on the ground, arms
extended toward him.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut took a moment to study them and his surroundings. There
was a freshness to the air that even his nose filters could not
diminish. It was morning here yet and the sun threw flat light
against the low hills and clumps of scrub. They stood out with a
clean chiaroscuro dominated by the long blue spear of the ship's
shadow wavering across the prairie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut looked up at his B-ship. She was a red and white striped
tower on his side with a gaping hole where the nose should have
been. Her number - 1107 - stenciled in luminous green beneath the
nose had just escaped the damage area. He returned his attention to
the natives.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>They remained stretched out on the grass, their stalked eyes
stretched out and peering up at him.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Let's hope you have a good metal-working industry, friends,'
Beirut said. 'Otherwise, I'm going to be an extremely unhappy
visitor.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>At the sound of his voice, the five grunted in unison:
'Toogayala ung-ung.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ung-ung?' Beirut asked. 'I thought we were going to
toogaya-la.' He brought out the linguapack, hung it on his chest
with the mike aimed at the natives, moved toward them out of the
ship's shadow. As an afterthought, he raised his right hand, palm
out and empty in the universal human gesture of peace, but kept his
left hand on the Borgen.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Toogayala!' the five screamed.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>His linguapack remained silent. Toogayala and ung-ung were
hardly sufficient for breaking down a language.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut took another step toward them.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The five rocked back to then: knees and arose, crouching and
apparently poised for flight. Five pairs of stalked eyes pointed
toward him. Beirut had the curious feeling then that the five
appeared familiar. They looked a little like giant grasshoppers
that had been crossed with an ape. They looked like bug-eyed
monsters from a work of science fantasy he had read in his youth,
which he saw as clear evidence that what the imagination of man
could conceive, nature could produce.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut took another step toward the natives, said: 'Well, let's
talk a little, friends. Say something. Make language, huh.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The five backed up two steps. Their feet made a dry rustling
sound in the grass.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut swallowed. Their silence was a bit unnerving.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Abruptly, something emitted a buzzing sound. It seemed to come
from a native on Beirut 's right. The creature clutched for its
tunic, gabbled: 's'Chareecha! s'Chareecha!' It pulled a small
object from a pocket to the others gathered around.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut tensed, lifted the Borgen.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The natives ignored him to concentrate on the object in the one
creature's hands.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What's doing?' Beirut asked. He felt tense, uneasy. This wasn't
going at all the way the books said it should.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The five straightened suddenly and without a backward look,
returned to their steam wagon and climbed into the cab.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>What test did I fail?</EM> Beirutwondered.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Silence settled over the scene.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>In the course of becoming a B-ship pilot, Beirut had gained fame
for a certain pungency of speech. He paused a moment to practice
some of his more famed selections, then took stock of his situation
- standing here exposed at the foot of the ship while the
unpredictable natives remained in their steam wagon. He clambered
back through the port, sealed it, and jacked into the local
computer outlet for a heart-to-heart conference.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The buzzing item was likely a timepiece,' the computer said.
The creature in possession of it was approximately two millimeters
taller than his tallest companion. 'There are indications this one
is the leader of the group.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Leader schmeader,' Beirut said. 'What's this toogayala they
keep yelling?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>From long association with Beirut, the computer had adopted a
response pattern to meet the rhetorical question or the question
for which there obviously was no answer. 'Tut, tut,' it said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You sound like my old Aunt Martha,' Beirut said. 'They screamed
that toogayala. It's obviously important.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'When they noted your hand, that is when they raised their
voices to the highest decibel level thus far recorded here,' the
computer said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But why?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Possible answer,' the computer said. 'You have five
fingers.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Five,' Beirut said. 'Five ... five ... five ... '</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We detect only five heavenly bodies here,' the computer said.
'You have noted that the skies are otherwise devoid of stars. The
rapid companion is overhead right now, you know.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Five.' Beirut said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'This planet,' the computer said, 'the three hot gaseous and
plasma bodies and the other companion to this planet's sun.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut looked at his hand, flexed the fingers.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They may think you are a deity,' the computer said. 'They have
six fingers; you have five.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Empty skies except for three suns,' Beirut said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Don't forget this planet and the other companion,' the computer
said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut thought about living on such a planet - no banks of stars
across the heavens ... all that hidden behind the enclosing
hydrogen cloud.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He began to tremble unaccountably with an attack of
the<EM>push.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What'll it take to fix the nose of the ship?' Beirut asked. He
tried to still his trembling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'A sophisticated machine shop and the work of electronics
technicians of at least grade five. The repair data is available in
my banks.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What're they doing in that machine?' Beirut demanded. 'Why
don't they talk?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Tut, tut,' the computer said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Thirty-eight minutes later, the natives again emerged from their
steam wagon, took up stations standing at the edge of the charred
ground.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut repeated his precautionary measures, went out to join
them. He moved slowly, warily, the Borgen ready in his left
hand.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The five awaited him this time without retreating. They appeared
more relaxed, chattering in low voices among themselves, watching
him with those stalked eyes. The word sounds remained pure
gibberish to Beirut, but he had the lingua pack trained on them and
knew the computer would have the language in a matter of time.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut stopped about eight paces from the natives, said: 'Glad
to see you, boys. Have a nice nap in your car?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The tallest one nodded, said: 'What's doing?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut gaped, speechless.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A native on the left said: 'Let's hope you have a good
metal-working industry, friends. Otherwise I'm going to be an
extremely unhappy visitor.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The tallest one said: 'Glad to see you, boys. Have a nice nap in
your car?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They're mimicking me!' Beirut gasped.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Confirmed,' the computer said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut overcame an urge to laugh, said: 'You're the crummiest
looking herd of no-good animals I ever saw. It's a wonder your
mothers could stand the sight of you.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The tall native repeated it for him without an error.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Reference to mothers cannot be accepted at this time,' the
computer said. 'Local propagation customs unknown. There are
indications these may be part vegetable - part animal.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh shut up,' Beirut said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh, shut up,' said a native on his left.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Suggest silence on your part,' the computer said. 'They are
displaying signs of trying to break down your language. Better we
get their language, reveal less of ourselves.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut saw the wisdom in it, spoke subvocally for the speaker on
his throat: 'You're so right.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He clamped his lips into a thin line, stared at the natives.
Silence dragged on and on.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Presently the tall one said: 'Aagroop somilican.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Toogayala,' said the one on the left.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Cardinal number,' the computer said. 'Probable position five.
Hold up your five fingsrs and say toogayala.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut obeyed.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Toogayala, toogayala,' the natives agreed. One detached
himself, went to the wagon and returned with a black metal
figurine, about half a meter tall, extended it toward Beirut .</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Cautiously, Beirut moved forward, accepted the thing. It felt
heavy and cold in his hand, it was a beautifully styled figure of
one of the natives, the eye stalks drooping into inverted U-shapes,
mouth open.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut brought out his contact kit, pressed it against the
metal.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The kit went 'ping' as it took a sample.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The natives stared at him.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Iron-magnesium-nickel alloy,' the computer said. 'Figure
achieved by casting. Approximate age of figure, twenty-five million
standard years.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut felt his throat go dry. He spoke subvocally: 'That can't
be!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Rating accurate to plus or minus six thousand years,' the
computer said. 'You will note the figures carved on the casting.
The inverted U on the chest is probably the figure five. Beneath
that is writing. Pattern too consistent for different
interpretation.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Civilization for twenty-five million years,' Beirut said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Plus or minus six thousand years,' the computer said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Again, Beirut felt a surge of the <EM>push,</EM> fought it down.
He wanted to return to the crippled ship, flee this place in spite
of the dangers. His knees shook.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The native who had given him the figurine, stepped forward,
reclaimed it. 'Toogayala,' the native said. It pointed to the
inverted U on the figure and then to the symbol on its own
chest.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But they only have a steam engine,' Beirut protested.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Very sophisticated steam engine,' the computer said. 'Cannon is
retractable, gyroscopically mounted, self-tracking.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They can fix the ship!' Beirut said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'If they will,' the computer said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The tall native stepped forward now, touched a finger to the
lingua pack, said: 's'Chareecha' with a falling inflection. Beirut
watched the hand carefully. It was six-fingered, definitely, the
skin a mauve-blue. The fingers were horn-tipped and
double-knuckled.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Try ung-ung,' the computer suggested.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ung-ung,' Beirut said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The tall one jumped backward and all five sent their eye stalks
peering toward the sky. They set up an excited chattering among
themselves in which Beirut caught several repeated sounds: 'Yaubron
... s'Chareecha ... Autoga ... Sreese-sreese ... '</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We have an approximation for entry now,' the computer said.
'The tall one is called Autoga. Address him by name.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Autoga,' Beirut said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The tall one turned, tipped his eye stalks toward Beirut .</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Say <EM>Ai-Yaubron ung sreese s'Chareecha,'</EM> the computer
said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut obeyed.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The natives faced each other, returned their attention to Beirut
. Presently, they began grunting almost uncontrollably. Autoga sat
down on the ground, pounded it with his hands, all the while
keeping up the grunting.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What the devil?' Beirut said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They're laughing,' the computer said. 'Go sit beside
Autoga.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'On the ground?' Beirut asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Is it safe?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Of course.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Why're they laughing?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They're laughing at themselves. You tricked them, made them
jump. This is definitely laughter.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Hesitantly, Beirut moved to Autoga's side, sat down. Autoga
stopped grunting, put a hand on Beirut 's shoulder, spoke to his
companions. With a millisecond delay, the computer began
translating: 'This god-self-creation is a good Joe, boys. His
accent is lousy, but he has a sense of humor.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Are you sure of that translation?' Beirut asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Reasonably so,' the computer said. 'Without greater
morphological grounding, a cultural investigation in depth and
series comparisons of vocal evolution, you get only a gross literal
approximation, of course. We'll refine it while we go along. We're
ready to put your sub-vocals through the lingua pack.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Let's talk,' Beirut said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Out of the lingua pack on his chest came a series of sounds
approximating 'Ai-ing-eeya.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Computer translation of Autoga's reply was: 'That's a good idea.
It's open sky.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut shook his head. It didn't sound right. Open sky?</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Sorry we damaged your vehicle,' Autoga said. 'We thought you
were one of our youths playing with danger.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut swallowed. 'You thought my ship ... you people can make
ships of this kind?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh, we made a few about ten million <EM>klurch</EM> ago,'
Autoga said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It was at least fifteen million <EM>klurch,'</EM> said the
wrinkle-faced native on Beirut's left.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Now, Choon, there you go exaggerating again,' Autoga said. He
looked at Beirut . 'You'll have to forgive Choon. He wants
everything to be bigger, better and greater than it is.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What's a klurch?' Beirut asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The computer answered for his ears alone: 'Probable answer - the
local year, about one and one-third standards.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm glad you decided to be peaceful,' Beirut said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The lingua pack rendered this into a variety of sounds and the
natives stared at Beirut's chest.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'He is speaking from his chest,' Choon said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Autoga looked up at the ship. 'There are more of you?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Don't answer that,' the computer said. 'Suggest the ship is a
source of mystical powers.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut digested this, shook his head. Stupid computer! 'These
are sharp cookies,' he said speaking aloud.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What a delightful arrangement of noises,' Autoga said. 'Do it
again.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You thought I was one of your youths,' Beirut said. 'Now who do
you think I am?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The lingua pack remained silent. His ear speaker said: 'Suggest
that question not be asked.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ask it!' Beirut said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A gabble of sound came from the lingua pack.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We debated that during the presence of s'Chareecha,' Autoga
said. 'We hid in the purple darkness, you understand, because we
have no wish to seed under the influence of s'Chareecha. A majority
among us decided you are the personification of our design for a
deity. I dissented. My thought is that you are an unknown, although
I grant you temporarily the majority title.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut wet his lips with his tongue.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'He has five fingers,' Choon said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'This was the argument you used to convince Tura and Lecky,'
Autoga said. 'This argument still doesn't answer Spispi's objection
that the five fingers could be the product of genetic manipulation
or that plus amputation.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But the eyes,' Choon said. 'Who could conceive of such eyes?
Not in our wildest imaginations ... '</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Perhaps you offend our visitor,' Autoga said. He glanced at
Beirut, the stalked eyes bending outward quizzically.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And the articulation of the legs and arms,' one of the other
natives ventured.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You're repeating old arguments, Tura,' Autoga said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut suddenly had a picture of himself as he must appear to
these natives. Their eyes had obvious advantages over his. He had
seen them look behind themselves without turning their heads. The
double thumb arrangement looked useful. They must think one thumb
an odd limitation. He began to chuckle.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What is this noise?' Autoga asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm laughing,' Beirut said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I will render that: 'I'm laughing at myself,'' the computer
said. Sounds issued from the lingua pack.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'A person who can laugh at himself has taken a major step toward
the highest civilization,' Autoga said. 'No offense intended.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The theories of Picheck that the concerted wish for a deity
must produce same are here demonstrated,' Choon said. 'It's not
quite the shape of entity I had envisioned, however, but we
...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Why don't we inquire?' Autoga asked and turned to Beirut . 'Are
you a deity?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm a mortal human being, nothing more,' Beirut said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The lingua pack remained silent.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Translate that!' Beirut blared.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The computer spoke for him alone: 'The experience, training and
memory banks available suggest that it would be safer for you to
pose as a deity. Their natural awe would enable you to ... '</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We're not going to fool these characters for five minutes,'
Beirut said. 'They've built spaceships. They have advanced
electronic techniques. You heard their radio. They've had a
civilization for more than twenty-five million years.' He paused.
'Haven't they?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Definitely. The cast figure was an advanced form and
technique.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Then translate my words!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut grew conscious that he had been speaking aloud and the
natives were following his words and the movements of his mouth
with a rapt intensity.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Translate,' Autoga said. 'That would be <EM>chtsuyop,</EM>
no?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You must speak subvocally,' the computer said. 'They are
beginning to break down your language.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They're doing it in their heads, you stupid pile of electronic
junk,' Beirut said. 'I have to use you! And you think I can pose as
a god with these people?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I will translate because you command it and my override
circuits cannot circumvent your command,' the computer said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'A computer!' Autoga said. 'He has a translating computer in his
vehicle! How quaint.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Translate,' Beirut said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Sounds issued from the lingua pack.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I am vindicated,' Autoga said. 'And you will note that I did it
on nothing more than the design of the vehicle and the cut of his
clothing, plus the artifacts, of course.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'This is why you are in command,' Choon said. 'I suffer your
correction and instruction abysmally.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Autoga looked at Beirut. 'What will you require - other than the
repair of your vehicle?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Don't you want to know where I'm from?' Beirut asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You are from somewhere,' Autoga said. 'It has been theorized
that other suns and worlds might exist beyond the hydrogen cloud
from which we were formed. Your presence suggests this theory is
true.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But ... but don't you want contact with us ... trade, exchange
ideas?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It is now apparent,' Autoga said, 'that the empty universe
theory has been disproved. However, a primitive such as yourself,
even you must realize such interchange would be pointless.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But we ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We well know that the enclosure of our universe has forced us
in upon ourselves,' Choon said. 'If that's what you were going to
say?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'He was going into boring detail about what he has to offer us,'
Autoga said. 'I suggest we get about doing what has to be done.
Spispi, you and Tura take care of the computer in his vehicle.
Choon and I will ... '</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What're you doing?' Beirut asked. He leaped to his feet. At
least, he thought he leaped to his feet, but in a moment he grew
conscious that he was still sitting on the ground, the five natives
facing him, staring.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They are erasing some of my circuits!' the computer wailed. 'A
magneto-gravitic field encloses me and the ... aroo, tut-tut,
jingle bells, jingle bells.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'This is very interesting,' Autoga said presently. 'He has made
contact with a civilization of our level at some previous time. You
will note the residual inhibition against lengthy travel away from
his home. We'll make the inhibition stronger this time.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut stared at the chattering natives with a sense of deja vu.
The speaker in his neck remained silent. His lingua pack made no
sound. He felt movement in his mind like spiders crawling along his
nerves.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Who do you suppose he could've contacted?' Choon asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Not one of our groups, of course,' Autoga said. 'Before we stay
out in the light of s'Chareecha and plant ourselves for the next
seeding, we must start a flow of inquiry.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Who will talk to us about such things?' Choon asked. 'We are
mere herdsmen.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Perhaps we should listen more often to the entertainment
broadcasts,' Spispi said. 'Something may have been said.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We may be simple herdsmen whose inquiry will not go very far,'
Autoga said, 'but this has been an experience to afford us many
hours of conversation. Imagine having the empty universe theory
refuted!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beirut awoke in the control seat of his ship, smelled in the
stink of the place his own sweat touched by the chemistry of fear.
A glance at the instrument panel showed that he had succumbed to
the push and turned ship. He was headed back out of the cloud
without having found anything in it.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>An odd sadness came over Beirut.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>I'll find my planet some day,</EM> he thought. <EM>I'll have
alabaster buildings and sheltered waters for sailing and long
stretches of prairie for game animals.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>The automatic log showed turn-around at ninety-four days.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>I stood it longer than Bingaling,</EM> he thought.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He remembered the conversation with Bingaling then and the
curious reference to a previous attempt at the cloud. <EM>Maybe I
did,</EM> he thought. <EM>Maybe I forgot because the push got so
tough.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>Presently, his mind turned to thoughts of Capella Base, of going
home. Just the thought of it eased the pressures of the push which
was still faintly with him. The push ... the push - it had beaten
him again. Next trip out, he decided, he'd head the opposite
direction, see what was to be found out there.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Almost idly then Beirut wondered about the push. <EM>Why do we
call it the push?</EM> he wondered. <EM>Why, don't we call it the
pull?</EM> The question interested him enough to put it to the
computer. 'Tut-tut,' the computer said.</P>

<H2 class="c4"><STRONG>The GM Effect</STRONG></H2>
<H3 class="c3">By Frank Herbert, 1965</H3>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>It was a balmy fall evening and as Dr Valeric Sabantoce seated
himself at the long table in Meade Hall's basement seminar room, he
thought of how the weather would be sensationalized tomorrow by the
newspapers and wire services. They would be sure to remark on the
general clemency of the elements, pointing out how Nature's smiling
aspect made the night's tragedy so much more horrible.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Sabantoce was a short, rotund man with a wild shock of black
hair that looked as though it had never known a comb. His round
face with its look of infant innocence invariably led strangers to
an incorrect impression - unless they were at once exposed to his
ribald wit or caught the weighted stare of his deeply-socketed
brown eyes.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Fourteen people sat around the long table now - nine students
and five faculty - with Professor Joshua Latchley in the chairman's
seat at the head.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Now that we're all here,' Latchley said, 'I can tell you the
purpose of tonight's meeting. We are faced with a most terrible
decision. We ... ahhh -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Latchley fell silent, chewed at his lower lip. He was conscious
of the figure he cut here - a tall, ungainly bald man in
thick-lensed glasses ... the constant air of apology he wore as
though it were a shield. Tonight, he felt that this appearance was
a disguise. Who could guess - except Sabantoce, of course - at the
daring exposed by this seemingly innocent gathering?</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Don't leave 'em hanging there, Josh,' Sabantoce said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes ... ahh, yes,' Latchley said. 'It has occurred to me that
Dr Sabantoce and I have a special demonstration to present here
tonight, but before we expose you to that experiment, as it were,
perhaps we should recapitulate somewhat.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Sabantoce, wondering what had diverted Latchley, glanced around
the table - saw that they were <EM>not</EM> all there. Dr Richard
Marmon was missing.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Did he suspect and make a break for it?</EM> Sabantoce
wondered. He realized then that Latchley was stalling for time
while Marmon was being hunted out and brought in here.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Latchley rubbed his shiny pate. He had no desire to be here, he
thought. But this had to be done. He knew that outside on the
campus the special 9 P.M. hush had fallen over Yankton Technical
Institute and this was his favorite hour for strolling - perhaps up
to the frosh pond to listen to the frogs and the couples and to
think on the etymological derivations of-</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He became conscious of restless coughing and shuffling around
the table, realized he had permitted his mind to wander. He was
infamous for it, Latchley knew. He cleared his throat. <EM>Where
the devil was that Marmon? Couldn't they find him?</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'As you know,' Latchley said, 'we've made no particular efforts
to keep our discovery secret, although we've tried to discourage
wild speculation and outside discussion. Our intention was to
conduct thorough tests before publishing. All of you - both the
student ... ahh, 'guinea pigs' and your professors of the faculty
committee - have been most co-operative. But inevitably news of
what we are doing here has spread - sometimes in a very hysterical
and distorted manner.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What Professor Latchley is saying,' Sabantoce interrupted, 'is
that the fat's in the fire.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Expressions of curiosity appeared on the faces of the students
who, up to this moment, had been trying to conceal their boredom.
Old Dr Inkton had a fit of coughing.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'There's an old Malay expression,' Sabantoce said, 'that when
one plays Bumps-a-Daisy with a porcupine, one is necessarily jumpy.
Now, all of us should've known this porcupine was loaded.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Thank you, Dr Sabantoce,' Latchley said. 'I feel ... and I know
this is a most unusual course ... that all of you should share in
the decision that must be made here tonight. Each of you, by
participating in this project, has become involved far more deeply
here than is the usual case with scientific experiments of this
general type. And since you student <EM>assistants</EM> have been
kept somewhat in the dark, perhaps Dr Sabantoce, as original
discoverer of the GM effect, should fill you in on some of the
background.'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Stall it is,</EM> Sabantoce thought.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Discovery of the genetic memory, or GM effect, was an
accident,' Sabantoce said picking up his cue. 'Dr Marmon and I were
looking for a hormonal method of removing fat from the body. Our
Compound 105 had given excellent results on mice and hamsters. We
had six generations without apparent side effects and that morning
I had decided to try 105 on myself.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Sabantoce allowed himself a self-deprecating grin, said: 'You
may remember I had a few excess pounds then.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The responsive laughter told him he had successfully lightened
the mood which had grown a bit heavy after Latchley's portentous
tone.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Josh is a damn' fool,</EM> Sabantoce told himself. <EM>I
warned him to keep it light. This is a dangerous business.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It was eight minutes after ten A.M. when I took that first
dosage,' Sabantoce said. 'I remember it was a very pleasant spring
morning and I could hear Carl Kychre's class down the hall reciting
a Greek ode. In a few minutes I began to feel somewhat euphoric -
almost drunk, but very gently so - and I sat down on a lab stool.
Presently, I began reciting with Kychre's class, swinging my arm to
the rhythm of it. The next thing I knew, there was Carl in the lab
door with some students peering in behind him and I realized I
might have been a bit loud.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That's magnificent archaic Greek but it <EM>is</EM> disturbing
my class,' Carl said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Sabantoce waited for laughter to subside.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I suddenly realized I was two people,' Sabantoce said. 'I was
perfectly aware of where I was and who I was, but I also knew quite
certainly that I was a Hoplite soldier named Zagreut recently
returned from a mercenary venture on Kyrene. It was the <EM>double
exposure</EM> effect that so many of you have remarked. I had all
the memories and thoughts of this Hoplite, including his very
particular and earthy inclinations toward a female who was
uppermost in his/my awareness. And there was this other thing we've
all noticed: I was thinking his/my thoughts in Greek, but they were
cross-linked to my dominant present and its English-based
awareness. I could translate at will. It was a very heady
experience, this realization that I was two people.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>One of the graduate students said: 'You were a whole mob,
Doctor.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Again, there was laughter. Even old Inkton joined in.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I must've looked a bit peculiar to poor Carl,' Sabantoce said.
'He came into the lab and said: 'Are you all right?' I told him to
get Dr Marmon down there fast ... which he did. And speaking of
Marmon, do any of you know where he is?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Silence greeted the question; then Latchley said: 'He's being
... summoned.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'So,' Sabantoce said. 'Well, to get on: Marmon and I locked
ourselves in the lab and began exploring this thing. Within a few
minutes we found out you could direct the subject's awareness into
any stratum of his genetic inheritance, there to be
<EM>illuminated</EM> by an ancestor of his choice; and we were
caught immediately by the realization that this discovery gave an
entirely new interpretation to the concept of instinct and to
theories of memory storage. When I say we were excited, that's the
understatement of the century.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The talkative graduate student said 'Did the effect fade the way
it does with the rest of us?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'In about an hour,' Sabantoce said. 'Of course, it didn't fade
completely, as you know. That old Hoplite's right here with me, so
to speak - along with the rest of the <EM>mob.</EM> A touch of 105
and I have him full on - all his direct memories up to the
conception-moment of my next ancestor in his line. I have some
overlaps, too, and later memories of his through parallel ancestry
and later siblings. I'm also linked to his maternal line, of course
- and two of you are tied into this same fabric, as you know. The
big thing here is that the remarkably accurate memories of that
Hoplite play hob with several accepted histories of the period. In
fact, he was our first intimation that much recorded history is a
crock.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Old Inkton leaned forward, coughed hoarsely, said: 'Isn't it
about time, doctor, that we did something about that?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'In a way, that's why we're here tonight,' Sabantoce said. And
he thought: <EM>Still no sign of Marmon. I hope Josh knows what
he's talking about. But we have to stall some more.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Since only a few of us know the full story on some of our more
sensational discoveries, we're going to give you a brief outline of
those discoveries,' Sabantoce said. He put on his most disarming
smile, gestured to Latchley. 'Professor Latchley, as
historian-coordinator of that phase in our investigations, can
carry on from here.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Latchley cleared his throat, exchanged a knowing look with
Sabantoce. <EM>Did Marmon suspect?</EM> Latchley asked himself.
<EM>He couldn't possibly know ... but he might have
suspected.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Several obvious aspects of this research method confront one
immediately,' Latchley said, breaking his attention away from
Sabantoce and the worry about Marmon. 'As regards any major
incident of history - say, a battle - we find a broad selection of
subjects on the victorious side and, sometimes, no selection at all
on the defeated side. Through the numerous cross references found
within even this small group, for example, we find remarkably few
<EM>adjacent</EM> and incidental memories within the Troy quadrant
of the Trojan wars - some female subjects, of course, but few
males. The male bloodlines were virtually wiped out.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Again, Latchley sensed restlessness in his audience and felt a
moment of jealousy. Their attention didn't wander when Sabantoce
was speaking. The reason was obvious: Sabantoce gave them the dirt,
so to speak.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Latchley forced his apologetic smile, said: 'Perhaps you'd like
a little of the real dirt.'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>They did perk up, by heaven!</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'As many have suspected,' Latchley said, 'our evidence makes it
conclusive that Henry Tudor did order the murder of the two princes
in the Tower ... at the same time he set into motion the propaganda
against Richard III. Henry proves to've been a most vile sort -
devious, cruel, cowardly, murderous - political murder was an
accepted part of his regime.' Latchley shuddered. 'And thanks to
his sex drive, he's an ancestor of many of us.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Tell 'em about Honest Abe,' Sabantoce said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Latchley adjusted his glasses, touched the corner of his mouth
with a finger, then: 'Abraham Lincoln.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He said it as though announcing a visitor and there was a long
pause.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Presently, Latchley said: 'I found this most distressing,
Lincoln was my particular hero in childhood. As some of you know,
General Butler was one of my ancestors and ... well, this was
<EM>most</EM> distressing.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Latchley fumbled in his pocket, brought up a scrap of paper,
studied it, then: 'In a debate with Judge Douglas, Lincoln said: 'I
tell you very frankly that I am not in favor of Negro citizenship.
I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way
the social and political equality of the white and black races;
that I am not nor ever have been, in favor of making voters or
jurors of Negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to
intermarry with white people. I will say in addition that there is
a physical difference between the white and black races, which, I
suppose, will forever forbid the two races living together upon
terms of social and political equality; and in as much as they
cannot so live - while they do remain together - there must be the
position of the superiors and the inferiors; and that I, as much as
any other man, am in favor of the superior being assigned to the
white man.' '</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Latchley sighed, stuffed the paper into a pocket. 'Most
distressing,' he said. 'Once, in a conversation with Butler,
Lincoln suggested that all Negroes should be deported to Africa.
Another time, talking about the Emancipation Proclamation, he said:
'If it helps preserve the Union, that's enough. But it's as clear
to me as it is to any thinking man in the Republic that this
proclamation will be declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court
following the cessation of hostilities.' '</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Sabantoce interrupted: 'How many of you realize what hot
potatoes these are?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The faces around the table turned toward him then back to
Latchley.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Once you have the clue of an on-the-scene observer,' Latchley
said, 'you even find correspondence and other records of
corroboration. It's amazing how people used to hide their
papers.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The talkative graduate student leaned his elbows on the table,
said: 'The hotter the potato, the more people will notice it, isn't
that right, Professor Latchley?'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Poor fellow's bucking for a better grade even now,</EM>
Sabantoce thought. And he answered for Latchley: 'The hottest
potatoes are the most difficult to swallow, too.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The inane exchange between Sabantoce and the student left a
hollow silence behind it and a deepening sense of uneasiness.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Another student said: 'Where's Dr Marmon? I understand he has a
theory that the more GM we bring into contact with consciousness,
the more we're controlled by the dominant brutality of our
ancestors. You know, he says the most brutal ones survived to have
children and we kind of gloss that over in our present awareness
... or something like that.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Old Inkton stirred out of his semidaze, turned his sour milk
eyes on Latchley. 'Pilgrims,' he said. 'Ah, yes,' Latchley
said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Sabantoce said: 'We have eye-witness accounts of Puritans and
Pilgrims robbing and raping Indians. Brutality. Some of my
ancestors, I'm afraid.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Tea party,' Old Inkton said.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Why doesn't the old fool shut up?</EM> Latchley wondered.
And he found himself increasingly uneasy about Marmon's absence.
<EM>Could there have been a double double-cross?</EM> he asked
himself.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Why not outline the Boston Tea Party?' Sabantoce asked.
There're a few here who weren't in on that phase.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes ... ahhh-mmmm,' Latchley said. 'Massachusetts had a
smuggling governor then, of course. Everybody of consequence in the
Colonies was smuggling. Navigation Acts and all that. The governor
and his cronies were getting their tea from the Dutch. Had
warehouses full of it. The British East India Company was on the
verge of bankruptcy when the British Government voted a subsidy -
equivalent to more than twenty million dollars in current exchange.
Because of this ... ahh, subsidy, the East India Company's tea
could be sent in at about half the price of the smuggled tea - even
including the tax. The governor and his henchmen faced ruin. So
they hired brigands to wear Indian disguise and dump the East India
Company's tea into the harbor - about a half million dollars worth
of tea. And the interesting thing is it was better tea than the
smugglers had. Another item to note is that the governor and his
cronies then added the cost of the hired brigand onto the price
charged for their smuggled tea.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Hot potatoes,' Sabantoce said. 'And we haven't even gone into
the religious issues - Moses and his aides drafting the Ten
Commandments ... the argument between Pilate and the religious
fanatic.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Or the present United States southern senator whose grandfather
was a light-skinned Negro,' Latchley said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Again, that air of suspenseful uneasiness came over the room.
People turned and looked at their companions, twisted in their
chairs.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Sabantoce felt it and thought: <EM>We can't let them start
asking the wrong questions. Maybe this was a bad tack to take. We
should've stalled them some other way ... perhaps in some other
place. Where is Marmon?</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Our problem is complicated by accuracy, strangely enough,'
Latchley said. 'When you know where to look, the corroborating
evidence is easy to find. The records of that southern senator's
ancestry couldn't be disputed.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A student at the opposite end of the table said: 'Well, if we
have the evidence then nothing can stop us.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ahh ... mmmm,' Latchley said. 'Well ... ahh ... the financial
base for our own school is involv ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He was interrupted by a disturbance at the door. Two uniformed
men pushed a tall blond young man in a rumpled dark suit into the
room. The door was closed and there came the click of a lock. It
was an ominous sound.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Sabantoce rubbed his throat.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The young man steadied himself with a hand against the wall,
worked his way up the room to a point opposite Latchley, lurched
across to an empty chair and collapsed into it. A thick odor of
whisky accompanied him.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Latchley stared at him, feeling both relief and uneasiness. They
were <EM>really</EM> all here now. The newcomer stared back out of
deep-set blue eyes. His mouth was a straight, in-curving line in a
long face that appeared even longer because of an extremely high
forehead.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What's going on here, Josh?' he demanded.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Latchley put on his apologetic smile, said: 'Now, Dick, I'm
sorry we had to drag you away from wherev ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Drag!' The young man glanced at Sabantoce, back to Latchley.
'Who are those guys? Said they were campus police, but I never saw
'em before. Said I had to come with them ... vital importance!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I told you this was an important meeting tonight,' Sabantoce
said. 'You've ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Important meeting,' the young man sneered.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We must decide tonight about abandoning the project,' Latchley
said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A gasp sounded around the table.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>That was clever,</EM> Sabantoce thought. He looked down the
table at the others, said: 'Now that Dr Marmon is here, we can
bring the thing out and examine it.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Aband ... ' Marmon said and sat up straight in his chair.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A long moment of silence passed. Abruptly, the table erupted to
discord - everyone trying to talk at once. The noise subsided only
when Sabantoce overrode it, slamming a palm against the table and
shouting: 'Please!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Into the sudden silence, Latchley said: 'You have no idea how
painful this disclosure is to those of us who've already faced the
realities of it.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Realities?' Marmon demanded. He shook his head and the effort
he made to overcome the effects of drink was apparent to everyone
around the table.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Let me point out to ail of you just one <EM>little</EM> part of
our total problem,' Sabantoce said. 'The inheritance of several
major fortunes in this country could be legally attacked - with
excellent chances of success - on the basis or knowledge we've
uncovered.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Sabantoce gave them a moment to absorb this, then: 'We're boat
rockers in a world whose motto is 'Don't give up the ship.' And we
could tip over quite a few ships.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Let us face it,' Latchley said, picking up his cue from
Sabantoce.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We are not a very powerful group.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Just a minute!' Marmon shouted. He hitched his chair closer to
the table. 'Bunch of crepe hangers. Where's y'r common sense? We
got the goods on a whole bunch of bums! Have you any idea how much
that's worth?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>From down the table to his left came one explosive word:
'Blackmail?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Latchley looked at Sabantoce with a raised-eyebrows expression
that said clearly: 'See? I told you so.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Why not?' Marmon demanded. 'These bums have been blackmailing
us f'r centuries. 'B'lieve what I tell y', man, or we'll pull y'r
arms outa their sockets!' That's what they been tellin's ...
telling us.' He nibbed his lips.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Sabantoce stood up, moved around the table and rested a hand
lightly on Marmon's shoulder. 'O.K. We'll let Dr Marmon be the
devil's advocate. While he's talking, Dr Latchley and I will go out
and get the film and equipment for the little demonstration we've
prepared for you. It should give you a clear understanding of what
we're up against.' He nodded to Latchley, who arose and joined
him.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>They crossed to the door, trying not to move too fast. Sabantoce
rapped twice on the panel. The door opened and they slipped out
between two uniformed guards, one of whom closed and locked the
door behind them.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'This way, please,' the other guard said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>They moved up the hall, hearing Marmon's voice fade behind them:
'The bums have always controlled the history books and the courts
and the coinage and the military and every ... '</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Distance reduced the voice to an unintelligible murmur.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Damn' Commie,' one of the guards muttered.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It does seem such a waste,' Latchley said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Let's not kid ourselves,' Sabantoce said as he started up the
stairs to the building's side exit. 'When the ship's sinking, you
save what you can. I think the Bishop explained things clearly
enough: God's testing all men and this is the ultimate test of
faith.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ultimate test, certainly,' Latchley said, laboring to keep up
with Sabantoce. 'And I'm afraid I must agree with whoever it was
said this would produce only chaos - unsettled times ...
anarchy.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Obvious,' Sabantoce said, as he stepped through the outer door
being held by another guard.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Latchley and the escort followed.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>At once, Sabantoce noted that all the campus lights had been
extinguished. <EM>The contrived power failure,</EM> he thought.
<EM>They probably switched Meade to an emergency circuit so we
wouldn't notice.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>One of their guards stepped forward, touched Latchley's arm,
said: 'Take the path directly across the quad to the Medical
School. Use the back door into Vance Hall. You'll have to hurry.
There isn't much time.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Sabantoce led the way down the steps and onto the dark path away
from Meade Hall. The path was only a suggestion of lighter gray in
the darkness. Latchley stumbled into Sabantoce as they hurried,
said: 'Excuse me.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>There was an impression of many moving dark shapes in the
shadows around them. Once a light was flashed in their faces,
immediately extinguished.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A voice came from the dark corner of a building: 'Down here.
Quickly.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Hands guided them down steps, through a door, past heavy
draperies, through another door and into a small, dimly lighted
room.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Sabantoce recognized it - a medical storeroom that appeared to
have been emptied of its supplies rather quickly. There was a small
box of compresses on a shelf at his right.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The room was heavy with tobacco smoke and the odor of
perspiration. At least a dozen men loomed up in the gloom around
them - some of the men in uniform.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A heavy-jowled man with a brigadier's star on his shoulder
confronted Sabantoce, said: 'Glad to see you made it safely. Are
they all in that building now?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Every last one,' Sabantoce said. He swallowed.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What about the formula for your Compound 105?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Well,' Sabantoce said, and allowed a smirk to touch his lips:
'I took a little precaution about that - just to keep you honest. I
mailed a few copies around to ... '</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We know about those,' the brigadier said. 'We've had the mails
from this place closed off and censored for months. I mean those
copies you typed in the bursar's office.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Sabantoce turned white. 'Well, they're ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Latchley interrupted, saying: 'Really, what's going on here? I
thought we ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Be quiet!' the brigadier snapped. He returned his attention to
Sabantoce. 'Well?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I ... ahh ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Those are the ones we found under the floor of his rooms,' said
a man by the door. 'The typeface is identical, sir.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But I want to know if he made any other copies,' the brigadier
said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>It was clear from the expression on Sabantoce's face that he had
not. 'Well ... I ...' he began.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Again Latchley interrupted. 'I see no need to ... '</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The loud cork-popping sound of a silenced revolver cut him off.
The noise was repeated.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Latchley and Sabantoce crumpled to the floor, dead before they
hit it. The man by the door stepped back, holstering his
weapon.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>As though punctuating their deaths, the outside night was ripped
by an explosion.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Presently, a man leaned into the room, said: 'The walls went in
the way we planned, sir. Thermite and napalm are finishing it.
Won't be a trace of those dirty Commies.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Good work, captain,' the brigadier said. 'That will be all.
Just keep civilians away from the immediate area until we're
sure.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Very good, sir.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The head retreated and the door was closed.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Good man,</EM> the brigadier thought. He fingered the lone
remaining copy of Compound 105's formula in his pocket. <EM>They
were all good men. Hand picked. Have to use a different screening
process to pick the men for the next project, though: the
investigation of possible military uses in this Compound
105.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I want these bodies burned practically to ash,' he said,
gesturing with a toe at Sabantoce and Latchley. 'Deliver them with
those you pick up from the building.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>From the shadowed rear of the room came a heavy, growling voice:
'What'll I tell the senator?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Tell him anything you want,' the brigadier said. 'I'll show him
my private report later.' And he thought: <EM>There's an immediate,
use for this compound - we have a senator right in our
pockets.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Damn' nigger lovers,' the growling voice said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Speak not unkindly of the dead,' said a smooth tenor from the
opposite corner of the room.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A man in a black suit pushed himself through to the open area
around the bodies, knelt and began praying in a soft, mumbling
voice.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Tell me as soon as that fire's out,' the brigadier said.</P>

<H1 class="c2"><STRONG>The Featherbedders</STRONG></H1>
<H3 class="c3">By Frank Herbert, 1968</H3>
<P> </P>
<P><EM>'Once there was a Slorin with a one-syllable name who is
believed to have said: 'niche for every one of us and every one of
us in Ms niche.''</EM></P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>-</EM> Folk saying of the <EM>Scattership</EM> People</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>There must be a streak of madness in a Slorin who'd bring his
only offspring, an untrained and untried youth, on a mission as
potentially dangerous as this one, Smeg told himself.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The rationale behind his decision remained clear: The colonial
nucleus must preserve its elders for their detail memory. The
youngest of the group was the logical one to be volunteered for
this risk. Still ...</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg forced such thoughts out of his mind. They weakened him. He
concentrated on driving the gray motor-pool Plymouth they'd signed
out of the government garage in the state capital that morning. The
machine demanded considerable attention.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The Plymouth was only two years old, but this region's red rock
roads and potholes had multiplied those years by a factor of at
least four. The steering was loose and assorted squeaks arose from
front and rear as he negotiated a rutted down-grade. The road took
them into a shadowed gulch almost bare of vegetation and across the
rattling planks of a wooden bridge that spanned a dry creekbed.
They climbed out the other side through ancient erosion gullies,
past a rone of scrub cottonwoods and onto the reaching flat land
they'd been crossing for two hours.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg risked a glance at Rick, his offspring, riding silently
beside him. The youth had come out of the pupal stage with a
passable human shape. No doubt Rick would do better next time -
provided he had the opportunity. But he was well within the
seventy-five percent accuracy limit the Slorin set for themselves.
It was a universal fact that the untrained sentience saw what it
<EM>thought</EM> it saw. The mind tended to supply the missing
elements.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A nudge from the Slorin mind-cloud helped, of course, but this
carried its own perils. The nudged mind sometimes developed powers
of its own - with terrifying results. Slorin had learned long ago
to depend on the directional broadcast of the mind's narrow band,
and to locate themselves in a network limited by the band's rather
short range.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>However, Rick had missed none of the essentials for human
appearance. He had a gentle, slender face whose contours were
difficult to remember. His brown eyes were of a limpid softness
that made human females discard all suspicions while the males
concentrated on jealousy. Rick's hair was a coarse, but acceptable
black. The shoulders were a bit high and the thorax somewhat too
heroic, but the total effect aroused no probing questions.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>That was the important thing: no probing questions.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg permitted himself a silent sigh. His own shape - that of a
middle-aged government official, gray at the temples, slightly
paunchy and bent of shoulder, and with weak eyes behind gold-rimmed
glasses - was more in the Slorin tradition.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Live on the margins,</EM> Smeg thought. <EM>Attract no
attention.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>In other words, don't do what they were doing today.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Awareness of danger forced Smeg into extreme contact with this
body his plastic genes had fashioned. It was a good body, a close
enough duplicate to interbreed with the natives, but he felt it now
from the inside, as it were, a fabric of newness stretched over the
ancient substance of the Slorin. It was familiar, yet bothersomely
unfamiliar.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>I am Sumctroxelunsmeg,</EM> he reminded himself. <EM>I am a
Slorin of seven syllables, each addition to my name an honor to my
family. By the pupa of my jelly-sire whose name took fourteen
thousand heartbeats to pronounce, I shall not fail!</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>There! That was the spirit he needed - the eternal wanderer,
temporarily disciplined, yet without boundaries. 'If you want to
swim, you must enter the water,' he whispered.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Did you say something, Dad?' Rick asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ahhh, that was very good, Smeg thought. Dad - the easy
colloquialism.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I was girding myself for the ordeal, so to speak,' Smeg said.
'We must separate in a few minutes.' He nodded ahead to where a
town was beginning to hump itself out of the horizon.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I think I should barge right in and start asking about their
sheriff,' Rick said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg drew in a sharp breath, a gesture of surprise that fitted
this body. 'Feel out the situation first,' he said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>More and more, he began to question the wisdom of sending Rick
in there. Dangerous, damnably dangerous. Rick could get himself
irrevocably killed, ruined beyond the pupa's powers to restore.
Worse than that, he could be exposed. There was the real danger.
Give natives the knowledge of what they were fighting and they
tended to develop extremely effective methods.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Slorin memory carried a bagful of horror stories to verify this
fact.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The Slorin must remain ready to take any shape, adapt to any
situation,' Rick said. 'That it!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Rick spoke the axiom well, Smeg thought, but did he really
understand it? How could he? Rick still didn't have full control of
the behavior patterns that went with this particular body shape.
Again, Smeg sighed. If only they'd saved the infiltration squad,
the expendable specialists.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Thoughts such as this always brought the more disquieting
question: <EM>Saved them from what?</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>There had been five hundred pupae in the <EM>Scattership</EM>
before the unknown disaster. Now there were four secondary
ancestors and one new offspring created on this planet. They were
shipless castaways on an unregistered world, not knowing even the
nature of the disaster which had sent them scooting across the void
in an escape capsule with minimum shielding.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Four of them had emerged from the capsule as basic Slorin
poly-morphs to find themselves in darkness on a steep landscape of
rocks and trees. At morning, there'd been four additional trees
there - watching, listening, weighing the newness against memories
accumulated across a timespan in which billions of planets such as
this one could have developed and died.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The capsule had chosen an excellent landing site: no nearby
sentient constructions. The Slorin now knew the region's native
label - central British Columbia. In that period of awakening,
though, it had been a place of unknown dangers whose chemistry and
organization required the most cautious testing.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>In time, four black bears had shambled down out of the
mountains. Approaching civilization, they'd hidden and watched -
listening, always listening, never daring to use the mindcloud. Who
knew what mental powers the natives might have? Four roughly
fashioned hunters had been metamorphosed from Slorin pupae in a
brush-screened cave. The hunters had been tested, refined.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finally - the hunters had scattered.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Slorin always scattered.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'When we left Washington you said something about the
possibility of a trap,' Rick said. 'You don't really think -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Slorin have been unmasked on some worlds,' Smeg said. 'Natives
have developed situational protective devices. This has some of the
characteristics of such a trap.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Then why investigate? Why not leave it alone until we're
stronger?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Rick!' Smeg shuddered at the youth's massive ignorance. 'Other
capsules may have escaped,' he said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But if it's a Slorin down here, he's acting like a dangerous
fool.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'More reason to investigate. We could have a damaged pupa here,
one who lost part of the detail memory. Perhaps he doesn't know how
to act - except out of instincts.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Then why not stay out of the town and probe just a little bit
with the mindcloud?'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Rick cannot be trusted with this job,</EM> Smeg thought.
<EM>He's too raw, too full of the youthful desire to play with the
mindcloud.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Why not?' Rick repeated.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg pulled the car to a stop at the side of the dirt road,
opened his window. It was getting hot - be noon in about an hour.
The landscape was a hardscrabble flatness marked by sparse
vegetation and a clump of buildings about two miles ahead. Broken
fences lined both sides of the road. Low cottonwoods off to the
right betrayed the presence of the dry creekbed. Two scrofulous
oaks in the middle distance provided shade for several steers. Away
on the rim of the flatland, obscured by haze, there was a
suggestion of hills.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You going to try my suggestion?' Rick asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'No.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Then why're we stopping? This as far as you go?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'No.' Smeg sighed. 'This is as far as <EM>you</EM> go. I'm
changing plans. You will wait. I will go into the village.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But I'm the younger. I'm - '</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And I'm in command here.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The others won't like this. They said -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The others will understand my decision.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But Slorin law says -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Don't quote Slorin law to me!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But-'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Would you teach your grandfather how to shape a pupa?' Smeg
shook his head. Rick must learn how to control the anger which
flared in this bodily creation. 'The limit of the law is the limit
of enforcement - the real limit of organized society. We're not an
organized society. We're two Slorin - alone, cut off from our
pitiful net. Alone! Two Slorin of widely disparate ability. You are
capable of carrying a message. I do not judge you capable of
meeting the challenge in this village.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg reached across Rick, opened the door.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'This is a firm decision?' Rick asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It is. You know what to do?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Rick spoke stiffly: 'I take that kit of yours from the back and
I play the part of a soil engineer from the Department of
Agriculture.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Not a <EM>part,</EM> Rick. You <EM>are</EM> a soil
engineer.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But-'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You will make real tests which will go into a real report and
be sent to a real office with a real function. In the event of
disaster, you will assume my shape and step into my niche.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I see.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I truly hope you do. Meanwhile, you will go out across that
field. The dry creekbed is out there. See those cottonwoods?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I've identified the characteristics of this landscape.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Excellent. Don't deviate. Remember that you're the offspring of
Sumctroxelunsmeg. Your jelly-sire's name took fourteen thousand
heartbeats to pronounce. Live with pride.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I was supposed to go in there, take the risk of it -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'There are risks and there are risks. Remember, make real tests
for a real report. Never betray your niche. When you have made the
tests, find a place in that creekbed to secrete yourself. Dig in
and wait. Listen on the narrow band at all times. Listen, that is
all you do. In the event of disaster, you must get word to the
others. In the kit there's a dog collar with a tag bearing a
promise of reward and the address of our Chicago drop. Do you know
the greyhound shape?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I know the plan, Dad.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Rick slid out of the car. He removed a heavy black case from the
rear, closed the doors, stared in at his parent.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg leaned across the seat, opened the window. It creaked
dismally.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Good luck, Dad,' Rick said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg swallowed. This body carried a burden of attachment to an
offspring much stronger than any in previous Slorin experience. He
wondered how the offspring felt about the parent, tried to probe
his own feelings toward the one who'd created him, trained him,
sealed his pupa into the <EM>Scattership.</EM> There was no sense
of loss. In some ways, he <EM>was</EM> the parent. As different
experiences changed him, he would become more and more the
individual, however. Syllables would be added to his name. Perhaps,
someday, he might feel an urge to be reunited.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Don't lose your cool, Dad,' Rick said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The God of the Slorin has no shape,' Smeg said. He closed the
window, straightened himself behind the steering wheel.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Rick turned, trudged off across the field toward the
cotton-woods. A low cloud of dust marked his progress. He carried
the black case easily in his right hand.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg put the car in motion, concentrated on driving. That last
glimpse of Rick, sturdy and obedient, had pierced him with
unexpected emotions. Slorin parted, he told himself. It is natural
for Slorin to part. An offspring is merely an offspring.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A Slorin prayer came into his mind: 'Lord, let me possess this
moment without regrets and, losing it, gain it forever.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The prayer helped, but Smeg still felt the tug of that parting.
He stared at the shabby buildings of his target town. Someone in
this collection of structures Smeg was now entering had not learned
a basic Slorin lesson: <EM>There is a reason for living; Slorin
must not live in a way that destroys this reason.</EM> Moderation,
that was the key.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A man stood in the dusty sunglare toward the center of the town
- one lone man beside the dirt road that ran unchecked toward the
distant horizon. For one haunted moment Smeg had the feeling it was
not a man, but a dangerous other-shaped enemy he'd met before. The
feeling passed as Smeg brought the car to a stop nearby.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Here was the American peasant, Smeg realized - tall, lean,
dressed in wash-faded blue bib overalls, a dirty tan shirt and
tennis shoes. The shoes were coming apart to reveal bare toes. A
ground green painter's hat with green plastic visor did an
ineffective job of covering his yellow hair. The visor's rim was
cracked. It dripped a fringe of ragged binding that swayed when the
man moved his head.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg leaned out his window, smiled: 'Howdy.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'How do.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg's sense of hearing, trained in a history of billions of
such encounters, detected the xenophobia and reluctant bowing to
convention at war in the man's voice.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Town's pretty quiet,' Smeg said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yep.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Purely human accents, Smeg decided. He permitted himself to
relax somewhat, asked: 'Anything unusual ever happen around
here?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You fum the gov'ment?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That's right.' Smeg tapped the motor-pool insignia on his door.
'Department of Agriculture.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Then you ain't part of the gov'ment conspiracy?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Conspiracy?' Smeg studied the man for a clue to hidden
meanings. Was this one of those southern towns where anything from
the government just had to be communist?</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Guess you ain't,' the man said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Of course not.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That there was a serious question you asked, then ... about
unusual thing happening?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I ... yes.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Depends on what you call unusual.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What ... do <EM>you</EM> call unusual?' Smeg ventured.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Can't rightly say. And you?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg frowned, leaned out his window, looked up and down the
street, studied each detail: the dog sniffing under the porch of a
building labeled 'General Store,' the watchful blankness of windows
with here and there a twitching curtain to betray someone peering
out, the missing boards on the side of a gas station beyond the
store - one rusty pump there with its glass chamber empty. Every
aspect of the town spoke of heat-addled somnolence ... yet it was
wrong. Smeg could feel tensions, transient emotional eddies that
irritated his highly tuned senses. He hoped Rick already had a
hiding place and was listening.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'This is Wadeville, isn't it?' Smeg asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yep. Used to be county seat 'fore the war.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He meant the War Between The States, Smeg realized, recalling
his studies of regional history. As always, the Slorin were using
every spare moment to absorb history, mythology, arts, literature,
science - You never knew which might be the valuable piece of
information.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ever hear about someone could get right into your mind?' the
man asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg overcame a shock reaction, groped for the proper response.
Amused disbelief, he decided, and managed a small chuckle. 'That
the unusual thing you have around here?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Didn't say yes; didn't say no.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Why'd you ask then?' Smeg knew his voice sounded like crinkling
bread wrapper. He pulled his head back into the car's shadows.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I jes' wondered if you might be hunting fer a teleepath?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The man turned, hawked a cud of tobacco toward the dirt at his
left. A vagrant breeze caught the spittle, draped it across the
side of Smeg's car.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh, dang!' the man said. He produced a dirty yellow bandanna,
knelt and scrubbed with it at the side of the car.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg leaned out, studied this performance with an air of
puzzlement. The man's responses, the vague hints at mental powers -
they were confusing, fitted no pattern in Slorin experience.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You got somebody around here claiming to be a telepath?' Smeg
asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Can't say.' The man stood up, peered in at Smeg. 'Sorry about
that there. Wind, you know. Accident. Didn't mean no harm.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Certainly.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Hope you won't say nothing to the sheriff. Got 'er all cleaned
off your car now. Can't tell where I hit 'er.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The man's voice carried a definite tone of fear, Smeg realized.
He stared at this American peasant with a narrow, searching gaze.
<EM>Sheriff,</EM> he'd said. Was it going to be this easy? Smeg
wondered how to capitalize on that opening. Sheriff. Here was an
element of the mystery they'd come to investigate.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>As the silence drew out, the man said: 'Got 'er all clean. You
can get out and look for yourself.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm sure you did, Mr ... ahhh ... '</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Painter, Josh'a Painter. Most folks call me Josh on account of
my first name there, Josh'a Painter.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Pleased to meet you, Mr Painter. My name's Smeg, Henry
Smeg.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Smeg,' Painter said with a musing tone. 'Don't rightly believe
I ever heard that name before.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It used to be much longer,' Smeg said. 'Hungarian.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm curious, Mr Painter, why you'd be afraid I might tell the
sheriff because the wind blew a little tobacco juice on my
car?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Never can tell how some folks'll take things,' Painter said. He
looked from one end of Smeg's car to the other, back to Smeg. 'You
a gov'ment man, this car an' all, reckoned I'd best be sure, one
sensible man to another.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You've been having trouble with the government around here, is
that it?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Don't take kindly to most gov'ment men hereabouts, we don't.
But the sheriff, he don't allow us to do anything about that.
Sheriff is a mean man, a certain mean man sometimes, and he's got
my Barton.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Your barton,' Smeg said, drawing back into the car to conceal
his puzzlement. <EM>Barton?</EM> This was an entirely new term.
Strange that none of them had encountered it before. Their study of
languages and dialects had been most thorough. Smeg began to feel
uneasy about his entire conversation with this Painter. The
conversation had never really been under control. He wondered how
much of it he'd actually understood. There was in Smeg a longing to
venture a mindcloud probe, to nudge the man's motives, make him
<EM>want</EM> to explain.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You one of them survey fellows like we been getting?' Painter
asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You might say that,' Smeg said. He straightened his shoulders.
'I'd like to walk around and look at your town, Mr Painter. May I
leave my car here?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>''Tain't in the way that I can see,' Painter said. He managed to
appear both interested and disinterested in Smeg's question. His
glance flicked sideways, all around - at the car, the road, at a
house behind a privet hedge across the way.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Fine,' Smeg said. He got out, slammed the door, reached into
the back for the flat-crowned western hat he affected in these
parts. It tended to break down some barriers.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You forgetting your papers?' Painter asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Papers?' Smeg turned, looked at the man.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Them papers full of questions you gov'ment people all us
use.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh.' Smeg shook his head. 'We can forget about papers
today.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You jes' going to wander around?' Painter asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That's right.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Well, some folks'll talk to you,' Painter said. 'Got all kinds
of different folks here.' He turned away, started to walk off.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Please, just a minute,' Smeg said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Painter stopped as though he'd run into a barrier, spoke without
turning. 'You want something?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Where're you going, Mr Painter?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Jes' down the road a piece.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'd ... ahhh, hoped you might guide me,' Smeg said. 'That is if
you haven't anything better to do?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Painter turned, stared at him. 'Guide? In Wadeville?' He looked
around him, back to Smeg. A tiny smile tugged at his mouth.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Well, where do I find your sheriff, for instance?' Smeg
asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The smile disappeared. 'Why'd you want him?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Sheriffs usually know a great deal about an area.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You sure you actual' want to see him?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Sure. Where's his office?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Well now, Mr Smeg ... ' Painter hesitated, then: 'His office is
just around the corner here, next the bank.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Would you show me?' Smeg moved forward, his feet kicking up
dust puddles in the street. 'Which corner?<SUP>'</SUP></P>
<P><SUP> </SUP></P>
<P>'This'n right here.' Painter pointed to a field stone building
at his left. A weed-grown lane led off past it. The corner of a
wooden porch jutted from the stone building into the lane.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg walked past Painter, peered down the lane. Tufts of grass
grew in the middle and along both sides, green runners stretching
all through the area. Smeg doubted that a wheeled vehicle had been
down this way in two years - possibly longer.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A row of objects on the porch caught his attention. He moved
closer, studied them, turned back to Painter.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What're all those bags and packages on that porch?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Them?' Painter came up beside Smeg, stood a moment, lips
pursed, eyes focused beyond the porch.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Well, what are they?' Smeg pressed.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'This here's the bank.' Painter said. 'Them's night
deposits.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg turned back to the porch. Night deposits? Paper bags and
fabric sacks left out in the open?</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'People leaves 'em here if'n the bank ain't open,' Painter said.
'Bank's a little late opening today. Sheriff had 'em in looking at
the books last night.'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Sheriff examining the bank's books?</EM> Smeg wondered. He
hoped Rick was missing none of this and could repeat it accurately
... just in case. The situation here appeared far more mysterious
than the reports had indicated. Smeg didn't like the feeling of
this place at all.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Makes it convenient for people who got to get up early and them
that collects their money at night,' Painter explained.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They just leave it right put in the open?' Smeg asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yep. 'Night deposit' it's called. People don't have to come
around when -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I know what it's called! But ... right out in the open like
that ... without a guard?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Bank don't open till ten thirty most days,' Painter said. 'Even
later when the sheriff's had 'em in at night.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'There's a guard,' Smeg said. 'That's it, isn't it?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Guard? What we need a guard fer? Sheriff says leave them things
alone, they gets left alone.'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>The sheriff again,</EM> Smeg thought. 'Who ... ahh, deposits
money like this?' he asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Like I said: the people who got to get up early and ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But <EM>who</EM> are these people?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh. Well, my cousin Reb: He has the gas station down to the
forks. Mr Seelway at the General Store there. Some farmers with
cash crops come back late from the city. Folks work across the line
at the mill in Anderson when they get paid late of a Friday. Folks
like that.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They just ... leave their money out on this porch.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Why not?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Lord knows,' Smeg whispered.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Sheriff says don't touch it, why - it don't get touched.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg looked around him, sensing the strangeness of this
weed-grown street with its wide-open night depository protected
only by a sheriff's command. Who was this sheriff? <EM>What</EM>
was this sheriff?</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Doesn't seem like there'd be much money in Wadeville,' Smeg
said. 'That gas station down the main street out there looks
abandoned, looks like a good wind would blow it over. Most of the
other buildings -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Station's closed,' Painter said. 'You need gas, just go out to
the forks where my cousin, Reb - '</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Station failed?' Smeg asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Kind of.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Kind of?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Sheriff, he closed it.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Why?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Fire hazard. Sheriff, he got to reading the state Fire
Ordinance one day. Next day he told Jamison to dig up the gas tanks
and cart 'em away. They was too old and rusty, not deep enough in
the ground and didn't have no concrete on 'em. 'Sides that, the
building's too old, wood all oily.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The sheriff ordered it ... just like that.' Smeg snapped his
fingers.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yep. Said he had to tear down that station. Old Jamison sure
was mad.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But if the sheriff says do it, then it gets done?' Smeg
asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yep. Jamison's tearing it down - one board every day. Sheriff
don't seem to pay it no mind long as Jamison takes down that one
board every day.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg shook his head. One board every day. What did that signify?
Lack of a strong time sense? He looked back at the night deposits
on the porch, asked: 'How long have people been depositing their
money here this way?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Been since a week or so after the sheriff come.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And how long has that been?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ohhhhh ... four, five years maybe.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg nodded to himself. His little group of Slorin had been on
the planet slightly more than five years. This could be ... this
could be - He frowned. But what if it wasn't?</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The dull plodding of footsteps sounded from the main street
behind Smeg. He turned, saw a tall fat man passing there. The man
glanced curiously at Smeg, nodded to Painter.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Mornin', Josh,' the fat man said. It was a rumbling voice.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Morning', Jim,' Painter said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The fat man skirted the Plymouth, hesitated to read the emblem
on the car door, glanced back at Painter, resumed his plodding
course down the street and out of sight.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That was Jim,' Painter said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Neighbor?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yep. Been over to the Widow McNabry's again ... all the whole
dang' night. Sheriff's going to be mighty displeasured believe
me.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'He keeps an eye on your morals, too?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Morals?' Painter scratched the back of his neck. 'Can't rightly
say he does.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Then why would he mind if ... Jim -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Sheriff, he says it's a sin and a crime to take what don't
belong to you, but it's a blessing to give. Jim, he stood right up
to the sheriff, said he jes' went to the widow's to give. So -'
Painter shrugged.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The sheriff's open to persuasion, then?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Some folks seems to think so.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You don't?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'He made Jim stop smoking and drinking.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg shook his head sharply, wondering if he'd heard correctly.
The conversation kept darting around into seeming irrelevancies.
Headjusted his hat brim, looked at his hand. It was a good hand,
couldn't be told from the human original. 'Smoking and drinking?'
he asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yep.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But why?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Said if Jim was taking on new ree-sponsibilities like the widow
he couldn't commit suicide - not even slow like.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg stared at Painter who appeared engrossed with a nonexistent
point in the sky. Presently. Smeg managed: 'That's the weirdest
interpretation of the law I ever heard.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Don't let the sheriff hear you say that.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Quick to anger, eh?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Wouldn't say that.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What <EM>would</EM> you say?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Like I told Jim: Sheriff get his eye on you, that is it. You
going to toe the line. Ain't so bad till the sheriff get his eye on
you. When he see you - that is the end.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Does the sheriff have his eye on you, Mr Painter?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Painter made a fist, shook it at the air. His mouth drew back in
a fierce, scowling grimace. The expression faded. Presently, he
relaxed, sighed. 'Pretty bad, eh?' Smeg asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Dang conspiracy,' Painter muttered. 'Gov'ment got its nose in
things don't concern it.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh?' Smeg watched Painter closely, sensing they were on
productive ground. 'What does -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Dang near a thousand gallons a year!' Painter exploded.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Uhhh -' Smeg said. He wet his lips with his tongue, a gesture
he'd found to denote human uncertainty.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Don't care if you are part of the conspiracy,' Painter said.
'Can't do nothing to me now.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Believe me, Mr Painter, I have no designs on ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I made some 'shine when folks wanted,' Painter said. 'Less'n a
thousand gallons a year ... almost. Ain't much considering the size
of some of them stills t'other side of Anderson. But them's across
the line! 'Nother county! All I made was enough fer the folks
'round here.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Sheriff put a stop to it?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Made me bust up my still.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Made <EM>you</EM> bust up your still?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yep. That's when he got my Barton.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Your ... ahhh ... barton?' Smeg ventured.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Right from under Lilly's nose,' Painter muttered. His nostrils
dilated, eyes glared. Rage lay close to the surface.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg looked around him, searching the blank windows, the empty
doorways. What in the name of all the Slorin furies was a
barton?</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Your sheriff seems to hold pretty close to the law,' Smeg
ventured.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Hah!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'No liquor,' Smeg said. 'No smoking. He rough on speeders?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Speeders?' Painter turned his glare on Smeg. 'Now, you tell me
what we'd speed in, Mr Smeg.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Don't you have any cars here?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'If my cousin Reb didn't have his station over to the forks
where he get the city traffic, he'd be bust long ago. State got a
law - car got to stop in jes' so many feet. Got to have jes' so
many lights. Got to have windshield wiper things. Got to have tires
which you can measure the tread on. Got to steer absolutely jes'
right. Car don't do them things, it is<EM>junk.</EM> Junk! Sheriff,
he make you sell that car for junk! Ain't but two, three folks in
Wadeville can afford a car with all them things.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'He sounds pretty strict,' Smeg said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Bible-totin' parson with hell fire in his eye couldn't be
worse. I tell you, if that sheriff didn't have my Barton, I'd a run
out long ago. I'd a ree-beled like we done in Sixty-one. Same with
the rest of the folks here ... most of 'em.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'He has their ... ahhh, bartons?' Smeg asked, cocking his head
to one side, waiting.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Painter considered this for a moment, then: 'Well, now ... in a
manner of speaking, you could call it that way.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg frowned. Did he dare ask what a barton was? No! It might
betray too much ignorance. He longed for a proper Slorin net, all
the interlocked detail memories, the Slorin spaced out within the
limits of the narrow band, ready to relay questions, test
hypotheses, offer suggestions. But he was alone except for one
inexperienced offspring hiding out there across the fields ...
waiting for disaster. Perhaps Rick had encountered the word,
though. Smeg ventured a weak interrogative.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Back came Rick's response, much too loud: 'Negative.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>So Rick didn't know the word either.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg studied Painter for a sign the man had detected the narrow
band exchange. Nothing. Smeg swallowed, a natural fear response
he'd noticed in this body, decided to move ahead more strongly.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Anybody ever tell you you have a most unusual sheriff?' he
asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Them gov'ment survey fellows, that's what they say. Come here
with all them papers and all them questions, say they interested in
our crime rate. Got no crime in Wade County, they say. Think they
telling us something!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That's what I heard about you,' Smeg offered. 'No crime.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Hah!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But there must be some crime,' Smeg said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Got no 'shine,' Painter muttered. 'Got no robbing and stealing,
no gambling. Got no drunk drivers 'cepting they come from somewhere
else and then they is mighty displeasured they drunk drove in Wade
County. Got noy'w-venile dee-linquents like they talkabout in the
city. Got no patent medicine fellows. Got nothing.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You must have a mighty full jail, though.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Jail?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'All the criminals your sheriff apprehends.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Hah! Sheriff don't throw folks in jail, Mr Smeg. Not 'less they
is from over the line and needs to sleep off a little ol' spree
while they sobers up enough to pay the fine.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh!' Smeg stared out at the empty main street, remembering the
fat man - Jim. 'He gives the local residents a bit more latitude,
eh? Like your friend, Jim.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Jes' leading Jim along, I say.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What do you mean?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Pretty soon the widow's going to be in the family way. Going to
be a quick wedding and a baby and Jim'll be jes' like all the rest
of us.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg nodded as though he understood. It was like the reports
which had lured him here ... but unlike them, too. Painter's
'survey fellows' had been amused by Wadeville and Wade County, so
amused even their driest governmentese couldn't conceal it. Their
amusement had written the area off - 'purely a local phenomenon.'
Tough southern sheriff. Smeg was not amused. He walked slowly out
to the main street, looked back along the road he'd traveled.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Rick was out there listening ... waiting.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>What would the waiting produce?</P>
<P> </P>
<P>An abandoned building up the street caught Smeg's attention.
Somewhere within it a door creaked with a rhythm that matched the
breeze stirring the dust in the street. A 'SALOON' sign dangled
from the building on a broken guy wire. The sign swayed in the wind
- now partly obscured by a porch roof, now revealed: 'LOON' ...
'SALOON' ... 'LOON' ... 'SALOON' ...</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The mystery of Wadeville was like that sign, Smeg thought. The
mystery moved and changed, now one thing, now another. He wondered
how he could hold the mystery still long enough to examine it and
understand it.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A distant wailing interrupted his reverie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>It grew louder - a siren.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Here he come,' Painter said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg glanced at Painter. The man was standing beside him glaring
in the direction of the siren.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Here he sure do come,' Painter muttered.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Another sound accompanied the siren now - the hungry throbbing
of a powerful motor.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg looked toward the sound, saw a dust cloud on the horizon,
something vaguely red within it.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Dad! Dad!' That was Rick on the narrow band.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Before he could send out the questioning thought, Smeg felt it -
the growing force of a mindcloud so strong it made him stagger.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Painter caught his arm, steadied him.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Gets some folks that way the first time,' Painter said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg composed himself, disengaged his arm, stood trembling.
Another Slorin! It had to be another Slorin. But the fool was
broadcasting a signal that could bring down chaos on them all. Smeg
looked at Painter. The natives had the potential - his own Slorin
group had determined this. Were they in luck here? Was the local
strain insensitive? But Painter had spoken of it getting some folks
the first time. He'd spoken of telepaths.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Something was very wrong in Wadeville ... and the mindcloud was
enveloping him like a gray fog. Smeg summoned all his mental
energy, fought free of the controlling force. He felt himself
standing there then like an island of clarity and calm in the midst
of that mental hurricane.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>There were sharp sounds all around him now - window blinds
snapping up, doors slamming. People began to emerge. They lined the
street, a dull-eyed look of expectancy about them, an angry
wariness. They appeared to be respectable humans all, Smeg thought,
but there was a sameness about them he couldn't quite define. It
had something to do with a dowdy, slump-shoulder look.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You going to see the sheriff,' Painter said. 'That's for
sure.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg faced the oncoming thunder of motor and siren. A long red
fire truck with a blond young woman in green leotards astride its
hood emerged from the dust cloud, hurtled down the street toward
the narrow passage where Smeg had parked his car.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>At the wheel of the truck sat what appeared to be a dark-skinned
man in a white suit, dark blue shirt, a white ten-gallon hat. A
gold star glittered at his breast. He clutched the steering wheel
like a racing driver, head low, eyes forward.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg, free of the mindcloud, saw the driver for what he was - a
Slorin, still in polymorph, his shape approximating the human ...
but not well enough ... not well enough at all.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Clustered around the driver, on the truck's seat, clinging to
the sides and the ladders on top, were some thirty children. As
they entered the village, they began yelling and laughing,
screaming greetings.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'There's the sheriff,' Painter said. 'That unusual enough fer
you?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The truck swerved to avoid Smeg's car, skidded to a stop
opposite the Lane where he stood with Painter. The sheriff stood
up, looked back toward the parked car, shouted: 'Who parked that
automobile there? You see how I had to swing way out to git past
it? Somebody tear down my 'No Parking' sign again? Look out if you
did! You know I'll find out who you are! Who did that?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>While the sheriff was shouting, the children were tumbling off
the truck in a cacophony of greetings - 'Hi, Mama!' 'Daddy, you see
me?' 'We been all the way to Comanche Lake swimming.' 'You see the
way we come, Pa?' 'You make a pie for me, Mama? Sheriff says I kin
have a pie.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg shook his head at the confusion. All were off the truck now
except the sheriff and the blonde on the hood. The mindcloud
pervaded the mental atmosphere like a strong odor, but it stopped
none of the outcry.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Abruptly, there came the loud, spitting crack of a rifle shot. A
plume of dust burst from the sheriff's white suit just below the
golden star.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Silence settled over the street.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Slowly, the sheriff turned, the only moving figure in the frozen
tableaux. He looked straight up the street toward an open window in
the second story of a house beyond the abandoned service station.
His hand came up; a finger extruded. He shook the finger, a man
admonishing a naughty child.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I warned you,' he said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg uttered a Slorin curse under his breath. The fool! No
wonder he was staying in polymorph and relying on the mindcloud -
the whole village was in arms against him. Smeg searched through
his accumulated Slorin experience for a clue on how to resolve this
situation. A whole village aware of Slorin powers! Oh, that sinful
fool!</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The sheriff looked down at the crowd of silent children, staring
first at one and then another. Presently, he pointed to a barefoot
girl of about eleven, her yellow hair tied in pigtails, a soiled
blue and white dress on her gangling frame.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You there, Molly Mae,' the sheriff said. 'You see what your
daddy done?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The girl lowered her head and began to cry.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The blonde on the truck's hood leaped down with a lithe grace,
tugged at the sheriff's sleeve.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Don't interrupt the law in the carrying out of its duties,' the
sheriff said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The blonde put her hands on her hips, stamped a foot. 'Tad, you
hurt that child and I won't never speak to you, never again,' she
said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Painter began muttering half under his breath: 'No ... no ... no
... no -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Hurt Molly Mae?' the sheriff asked. 'Now, you know I won't hurt
her. But she's got to go away, never see her kin again as long as
she lives. You know that.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But Molly Mae didn't do you no hurt,' the young woman said. 'It
were her daddy. Why can't you send him away?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'There's some things you just can't understand,' the sheriff
said. 'Grown up adult can only be taken from sinful, criminal ways
a slow bit at a time 'less'n you make a little child of him. Now,
I'd be doing the crime if I made a little child out of a grown-up
adult. Little girl like Molly Mae, she's a child right now. Don't
make much difference.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>So that was it, Smeg thought. That was the sheriff's real hold
on this community. Smeg suddenly felt that a barton had to mean - a
hostage.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It's cruel,' the blond young woman said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Law got to be cruel sometimes,' the sheriff said. 'Law got to
eliminate crime. Almost got it done. Only crimes we had hereabouts
for months are crimes 'gainst me. Now, you all know you can't get
away with crimes like that. But when you show that
<EM>dis-</EM>regard for the majesty of the law, you got to be
punished. You got to remember, all of you, that every part of a
family is ree-sponsible for the whole entire family.'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Pure Slorin thinking,</EM> Smeg thought. He wondered if he
could make his move without exposing his own alien origins.
Something had to be done here and soon. Did he dare venture a probe
of greeting into the fool's mind? No. The sheriff probably wouldn't
even receive the greeting through that mindcloud noise.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Maybe you're doing something wrong then,' the young woman said.
'Seems awful funny to me when the only crimes are put right on the
law itself.'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>A very pertinent observation,</EM> Smeg thought.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Abruptly, Painter heaved himself into motion, lurched through
the crowd of children toward the sheriff.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The blond young woman turned, said: 'Daddy! You stay out'n
this.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You be still now, you hear, Barton Marie?' Painter growled.
'You know you can't do anything,' she wailed. 'He'll only send me
away.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Good! I say good!' Painter barked. He pushed in front of the
young woman, stood glaring up at the sheriff.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Now, Josh,' the sheriff said, his voice mild. They fell silent,
measuring each other.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>In this moment, Smeg's attention was caught by a figure walking
toward them on the road into the village. The figure emerged from
the dust - a young man carrying a large black case.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Rick!</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg stared at his offspring. The young man walked like a
puppet, loose at the knees. His eyes stared ahead with a blank
seeking.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>The mindcloud,</EM> Smeg thought. <EM>Rick was young, weak.
He'd been calling out, wide open when the mindcloud struck. The
force that had staggered a secondary ancestor had stunned the young
Slorin. He was coming now blindly toward the irritation
source.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Who that coming there?' the sheriff called. 'That the one
parked this car illegal?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Rick!' Smeg shouted.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Rick stopped.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Stay where you are!' Smeg called. This time, he sent an
awakening probe into the youth.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Rick stared around him, awareness creeping into his eyes. He
focused on Smeg, mouth falling open.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Dad!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Who're you?' the sheriff demanded, staring at Smeg. A jolt from
the mindcloud jarred Smeg.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>There was only one way to do this, Smeg realized. Fight fire
with fire. The natives already had felt the mindcloud.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg began opening the enclosing mental shields, dropped them
abruptly and lashed out at the sheriff. The Slorin polymorph
staggered back, slumped onto the truck seat. His human shape
twisted, writhed.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Who're you?' the sheriff gasped.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Shifting to the Slorin gutturals, Smeg said: 'I will ask the
questions here. Identify yourself.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg moved forward, a path through the children opening for him.
Gently, he moved Painter and the young woman aside.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Do you understand me?' Smeg demanded.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I ... understand you.' The Slorin gutturals were, rough and
halting, but recognizable.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>In a softer tone, Smeg said: 'The universe has many crossroads
where friends can meet. Identify yourself.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Min ... I think. Pzilimin.' The sheriff straightened himself on
the seat, restored some of his human shape to its previous form.
'Who are you?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I am Sumctroxelunsmeg, secondary ancestor.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What's a secondary ancestor?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg sighed. It was pretty much as he had feared. The name,
Pzilimin, that was the primary clue - a tertiary ancestor from the
<EM>Scattership.</EM> But this poor Slorin had been damaged,
somehow, lost part of his detail memory. In the process, he had
created a situation here that might be impossible to rectify. The
extent of the local mess had to be examined now, though.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I will answer your questions later,' Smeg said. 'Meanwhile
-'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You know this critter?' Painter asked. 'You part of the
conspiracy?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Shifting to English, Smeg said: 'Mr Painter, let the government
handle its own problems. This man is one of our problems.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Well, he sure is a problem and that's the truth.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Will you let me handle him?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You sure you can do it?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I ... think so.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I sure hope so.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg nodded, turned back to the sheriff. 'Have you any idea what
you've done here?' he asked in basic Slorin.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I ... found myself a suitable official position and filled it
to the best of my ability. Never betray your niche. I remember
that. Never betray your niche.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Do you know what you are?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm ... a Slorin?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Correct. A Slorin tertiary ancestor. Have you any idea how you
were injured?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I ... no. Injured?' He looked around at the people drawing
closer, all staring curiously. 'I ... woke up out there in the ...
field. Couldn't ... remember -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Very well, we'll - '</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I remembered one thing! We were supposed to lower the crime
rate, prepare a suitable society in which ... in which ... I ...
don't know.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg stared across the children's heads at Rick who had come to
a stop behind the truck, returned his attention to Pzilimin.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I have the crime rate here almost down to an irreducible
minimum,' the Slorin sheriff said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg passed a hand across his eyes. Irreducible minimum! He
dropped his hand, glared up at the poor fool. 'You have made these
people aware of Slorin,' he accused. 'You've made them aware of
themselves, which is worse. You've started them thinking about
what's behind the law. Something every native law enforcement
official on this planet knows by instinct, and you, a Slorin -
injured or not - couldn't see it.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'See what?' Pzilimin asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Without crime there's no need for law enforcement officers! We
are here to prepare niches in which Slorin can thrive. And you
begin by doing yourself out of a job! The first rule in any
position is to maintain enough of the required activity for that
job to insure your continued employment. Not only that, you must
increase your scope, open more such positions. This is what is
meant by not betraying your niche.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But ... we're supposed to create a society in which &#8230; in
which -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You were supposed to reduce the incidence of violence, you
fool! You must channel the crime into more easily manageable
patterns. You left them violence! One of them shot at you.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh ... they've tried worse than that.' Smeg looked to his
right, met Painter's questioning gaze.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'He another Hungarian?' Painter asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ah-h-h, yes!' Smeg said, leaping at this opportunity. 'Thought
so, you two talking that foreign language there.' Painter glared up
at Pzilimin. 'He oughta be dee-ported.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That's the very thing,' Smeg agreed. 'That's why I'm here.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Well, by gollies!' Painter said. He sobered. 'I better warn
you, though. Sheriff, he got some kind of machine sort of that
scrambles your mind. Can't hardly think when he turns it on.
Carries it in his pocket, I suspect.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We know all about that,' Smeg said. 'I have a machine of the
same kind myself. It's a defense secret and he had no right to use
it.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'll bet you ain't Department of Agriculture at all,' Painter
said. 'I bet you're with the CIA.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We won't talk about that,' Smeg said. 'I trust, however, that
you and your friends won't mention what has happened here.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We're true blue Americans, all of us, Mr Smeg. You don't have
to worry about us.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Excellent,' Smeg said. And he thought: <EM>How convenient. Do
they think me an utter fool?</EM> Smoothly, he turned back to
Pzilimin, asked: 'Did you follow all that?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They think you're a secret agent.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'So it seems. Our task of extracting you from this situation has
been facilitated. Now tell me, what have you done about their
children?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Their children?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You heard me.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Well ... I just erased all those little tracks in their little
minds and put 'em on a train headed north, the ones I sent away to
punish their folks. These creatures have a very strong protective
instinct toward the young. Don't have to worry about their -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I know about their instincts, Pzilimin. We'll have to find
those children, restore them and return them.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'How'll we find them?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Very simple. We'll travel back and forth across this continent,
listening on the narrow band. We will listen for you, Pzilimin. You
cannot erase a mind without putting your own patterns in it.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Is that what happened when I tried to change the adult?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg goggled at him, senses reeling. Pzilimin couldn't have done
that, Smeg told himself. He couldn't have converted a native into a
Slorin-patterned, full-power broadcast unit and turned it loose on
this planet. No Slorin could be that stupid! 'Who?' he managed.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Mr McNabry.'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>McNabry? McNabry?</EM> Smeg knew he'd heard the name
somewhere. <EM>McNabry? Widow McNabry!</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Sheriff, he say something about Widow McNabry?' Painter asked.
'I thought I heard him -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What happened to the late Mr McNabry?' Smeg demanded, whirling
on Painter.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh, he drowned down south of here. In the river. Never did find
his body.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg rounded on Pzilimin. 'Did you -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh no! He just ran off. We had this report he drowned and I
just -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'In effect, you killed a native.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I didn't do it on purpose.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Pzilimin, get down off that vehicle and into the rear seat of
my machine over here. We will forget that I'm illegally parked,
shall we?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What're you going to do?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm going to take you away from here. Now, get down off of
there!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes sir.' Pzilimin moved to obey. There was a suggestion of
rubbery, nonhuman action to his knees that made Smeg shudder.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Rick,' Smeg called. 'You will drive.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes, Dad.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Smeg turned to Painter. 'I hope you all realize the serious
consequences to yourselves if any of this should get out?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We sure do, Mr Smeg. Depend on it.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I am depending on it,' Smeg said. And he thought: <EM>Let them
analyze that little statement ... after we're gone.</EM> More and
more he was thanking the Slorin god who'd prompted him to change
places with Rick. One wrong move and this could've been a disaster.
With a curt nod to Painter, he strode to his car, climbed into the
rear beside Pzilimin. 'Let's go, Rick.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Presently, they were turned around, headed back toward the state
capital. Rick instinctively was pressing the Plymouth to the limit
of its speed on this dirt road. Without turning, he spoke over his
shoulder to Smeg:</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That was real cool, Dad, the way you handled that. We go right
back to the garage now?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We disappear at the first opportunity,' Smeg said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Disappear?' Pzilimin asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We're going pupa, all of us, and come out into new niches.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Why?' Rick said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Don't argue with me! That village back there wasn't what it
seemed.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Pzilimin stared at him. 'But you said we'd have to find their
children and -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That was for their benefit, playing the game of ignorance. I
suspect they've already found their children. Faster, Rick.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm going as fast as I dare right now, Dad.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'No matter. They're not going to chase us.' Smeg took off his
western hat, scratched where the band had pressed into his
temples.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What was that village. Dad?' Rick asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm not sure,' Smeg said. 'But they made it too easy for us to
get Pzilimin out of there. I suspect they are the source of the
disaster which set us down here without our ship.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Then why didn't they just ... eliminate Pzilimin and -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Why didn't Pzilimin simply eliminate those who opposed him?'
Smeg asked. 'Violence begets violence, Rick. This is a lesson many
sentient beings have learned. They had their own good reasons for
handling it this way.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What'll we do?' Rick asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We'll go to earth, like foxes, Rick. We will employ the utmost
caution and investigate this situation. That is what we'll do.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Don't they know that ... back there?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Indeed, they must. This should be very interesting.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Painter stood in the street staring after the retreating car
until it was lost in a dust cloud. He nodded to himself once.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A tall fat man came up beside him, said: 'Well, Josh, it
worked.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Told you it would,' Painter said. 'I knew dang well another
capsule of them Slorin got away from us when we took their
ship.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The blond young woman moved around in front of them, said: 'My
dad sure is smart.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You listen to me now, Barton Marie,' Painter said. 'Next time
you find a blob of something jes' lyin' in a field, you leave it
alone, hear?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'How was I to know it'd be so strong?' she asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That's jes' it!' Painter snapped. 'You never know. That's why
you leaves such things alone. It was you made him so dang strong,
pokin' him that way. Slorin aren't all that strong 'less'n you
ignite'em, hear?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes, Dad.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Dang near five years of him,' the fat man said. 'I don't think
I coulda stood another year. He was gettin' worse all the
time.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They always do,' Painter said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What about that Smeg?' the fat man asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That was a wise ol' Slorin,' Painter agreed. 'Seven syllables
if I heard his full name rightly.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Think he suspects?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Pretty sure he does.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What we gonna do?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What we allus do. We got their ship. We're gonna move out for a
spell.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh-h-h, not again!' the fat man complained.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Painter slapped the man's paunch. 'What you howling about, Jim?
You changed from McNabry into this when you had to. That's the way
life is. You change when you have to.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I was just beginning to get used to this place.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Barton Marie stamped her foot. 'But this is such a nice
body!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'There's other bodies, child,' Painter said. 'Jes' as nice.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'How long you think we got?' Jim asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh, we got us several months. One thing you can depend on with
Slorin, they are cautious. They don't do much of anything very
fast.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I don't want to leave,' Barton Marie said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It won't be forever, child,' Painter said. 'Once they give up
hunting for us, we'll come back. Slorin make a planet pretty nice
for our kind. That's why we tolerates 'em. Course, they're pretty
stupid. They work too hard. Even make their own ships ... for which
we can be thankful. They haven't learned how to blend into anything
but a bureaucratic society. But that's their misfortune and none of
our own.'</P>

<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What did you do about the government survey people?' Smeg asked
Pzilimin, bracing himself as the car lurched in a particularly deep
rut.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I interviewed them in my office, kept it pretty shadowy, wore
dark glasses,' Pzlimin said. 'Didn't use the ... mindcloud.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That's a blessing,' Smeg said. He fell silent for a space,
then: 'A damn poem keeps going through my head. Over and over, it
just keeps going around in my head.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'A poem, you said?' Rick asked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes. It's by a native wit ... Jonathan Swift, I believe his
name was. Read it during my first studies of their literature. It
goes something like this - 'A flea hath smaller fleas that on him
prey; and these have smaller still to bite 'em; and so proceed ad
infinitum'.'</P>

<P>On his last night on Earth, Ted Graham stepped out of a
glass-walled telephone booth, ducked to avoid a swooping moth that
battered itself in a frenzy against a bare globe above the
booth.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ted Graham was a long-necked man with a head of pronounced egg
shape topped by prematurely balding sandy hair. Something about his
lanky, intense appearance suggested his occupation: certified
public accountant.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He stopped behind his wife, who was studying a newspaper
classified page, and frowned. 'They said to wait here. They'll come
get us. Said the place is hard to find at night.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Martha Graham looked up from the newspaper. She was a doll-faced
woman, heavily pregnant, a kind of, pink prettiness about her. The
yellow glow from the light above the booth subdued the red-auburn
cast of her ponytail hair.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I just <EM>have</EM> to be in a house when the baby's born,'
she said. 'What'd they sound like?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I dunno. There was a funny kind of interruption - like an
argument in some foreign language.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Did they sound foreign?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'In a way.' He motioned along the night-shrouded line of
trailers toward one with two windows glowing amber. 'Let's wait
inside. These bugs out here are fierce.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Did you tell them which trailer is ours?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes. They didn't sound at all anxious to look at it. That's odd
- them wanting to trade their house for a trailer.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'There's nothing odd about it. They've probably just got itchy
feet like we did.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He appeared not to hear her. 'Funniest-sounding language you
ever heard when that argument started - like a squire of
noise.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Inside the trailer, Ted Graham sat down on the green couch that
opened into a double bed for company.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They could use a good tax accountant around here,' he said,
'When I first saw the place, I got that definite feeling. The
valley looks prosperous. It's a wonder nobody's opened an office
here before.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>His wife took a straight chair by the counter separating kitchen
and living area, folded her hands across her heavy stomach.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm just continental tired of wheels going around under me,'
she said. 'I want to sit and stare at the same view for the rest of
my life. I don't know how a trailer ever seemed glamorous when
-'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It was the inheritance gave us itchy feet,' he said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Tires gritted on gravel outside.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Martha Graham straightened. 'Could that be them?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Awful quick, if it is.' He went to the door, opened it, stared
down at the man who was just raising a hand to knock.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Are you Mr Graham?' asked the man.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes.' He found himself staring at the caller.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm Clint Rush. You called about the house?' The man moved
farther into the light. At first, he'd appeared an old man, fine
wrinkle lines in his face, a tired leather look to his skin. But as
he moved his head in the light, the wrinkles seemed to dissolve -
and with them, the years lifted from him.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes, we called,' said Ted Graham. He stood aside. 'Do you want
to look at the trailer now?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Martha Graham crossed to stand beside her husband. 'We've kept
it in awfully good shape,' she said. 'We've never let anything get
seriously wrong with it.'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>She sounds too anxious,</EM> thought Ted Graham. <EM>I wish
she'd let me do the talking for the two of us.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We can come back and look at your trailer tomorrow in
daylight,' said Rush. 'My car's right out here, if you'd like to
see our house.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ted Graham hesitated. He felt a nagging worry tug at his mind,
tried to fix his attention on what bothered him.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Hadn't we better take our car?' he asked. 'We could follow
you.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'No need,' said Rush. 'We're coming back into town tonight
anyway. We can drop you off then.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ted Graham nodded. 'Be right with you as soon as I lock up.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Inside the car, Rush mumbled introductions. His wife was a dark
shadow in the front seat, her hair drawn back in a severe bun. Her
features suggested gypsy blood. He called her Raimee.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Odd name,</EM> thought Ted Graham. And he noticed that she,
too, gave that strange first impression of age that melted in a
shift of light.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Mrs Rush turned her gypsy features toward Martha Graham. 'You
are going to have a baby?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>It came out as an odd, veiled statement.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Abruptly, the car rolled forward.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Martha Graham said, 'It's supposed to be born in about two
months. We hope it's a boy.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Mrs Rush looked at her husband. 'I have changed my mind,' she
said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Rush spoke without taking his attention from the road. 'It is
too ...' He broke off, spoke in a tumble of strange sounds.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ted Graham recognized it as the language he'd heard on the
telephone.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Mrs Rush answered in the same tongue, anger showing in the
intensity of her voice. Her husband replied, his voice calmer.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Presently, Mrs Rush fell moodily silent.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Rush tipped his head toward the rear of the car. 'My wife has
moments when she does not want to get rid of the old house. It has
been with her for many years.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ted Graham said, 'Oh.' Then: 'Are you Spanish?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Rush hesitated. 'No. We are Basque.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He turned the car down a well-lighted avenue that merged into a
highway. They turned onto a side road. There followed more turns -
left, right, right.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ted Graham lost track.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>They hit a jolting bump that made Martha gasp.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I hope that wasn't too rough on you,' said Rush. 'We're almost
there.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The car swung into a lane, its lights picking out the skeleton
outlines of trees: peculiar trees - tall, gaunt, leafless. They
added to Ted Graham's feeling of uneasiness.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The lane dipped, ended at a low wall of a house - red brick with
clerestory windows beneath overhanging eaves. The effect of the
wall and a wide-beamed door they could see to the left was
ultramodern.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ted Graham helped his wife out of the car, followed the Rushes
to the door.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I thought you told me it was an old house,' he said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It was designed by one of the first modernists,' said Rush. He
fumbled with an odd curved key. The wide door swung open onto a
hallway equally wide, carpeted by a deep pile rug. They could
glimpse floor-to-ceiling view windows at the end of the hall, city
lights beyond.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Martha Graham gasped, entered the hall as though in a trance.
Ted Graham followed, heard the door close behind them.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It's so-so - so <EM>big'</EM> exclaimed Martha Graham.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You want to trade <EM>this</EM> for our trailer?' asked Ted
Graham.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It's too inconvenient for us,' said Rush. 'My work is over the
mountains on the coast.' He shrugged. 'We cannot sell it.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ted Graham looked at him sharply. 'Isn't there any money around
here?' He had a sudden vision of a tax accountant with no
customers.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Plenty of money, but no real estate customers.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>They entered the living room. Sectional divans lined the walls.
Subdued lighting glowed from the corners. Two paintings hung on the
opposite walls - oblongs of odd lines and twists that made Ted
Graham dizzy.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Warning bells clamored in his mind.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Martha Graham crossed to the windows, looked at the light far
away below. 'I had no idea we'd climbed that far,' she said. 'It's
like a fairy city.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Mrs Rush emitted a short, nervous laugh.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ted Graham glanced around the room, thought: <EM>If the rest of
the house is like this, it's worth fifty or sixty thousand.</EM> He
thought of the trailer: <EM>A good one, but not worth more than
seven thousand.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>Uneasiness was like a neon sign flashing in his mind. 'This
seems so ...' He shook his head.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Would you like to see the rest of the house?' asked Rush.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Martha Graham turned from the window. 'Oh, yes.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ted Graham shrugged. <EM>No harm in looking,</EM> he
thought.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>When they returned to the living room, Ted Graham had doubled
his previous estimate on the house's value. His brain reeled with
the summing of it: a solarium with an entire ceiling covered by sun
lamps, an automatic laundry where you dropped soiled clothing down
a chute, took it washed and ironed from the other end ...</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Perhaps you and your wife would like to discuss it in private,'
said Rush. 'We will leave you for a moment.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>And they were gone before Ted Graham could protest.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Martha Graham said, 'Ted, I honestly never in my life
dreamed-'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Something's very wrong, honey.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But, Ted -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'This house is worth at least a hundred thousand dollars. Maybe
more. And they want to trade <EM>this -</EM>' he looked around him
- 'for a seven-thousand-dollar trailer?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ted, they're foreigners. And if they're so foolish they don't
know the value of this place, then why should -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I don't like it,' he said. Again he looked around the room,
recalled the fantastic equipment of the house. 'But maybe you're
right.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He stared out at the city lights. They had a lacelike quality:
tall buildings linked by lines of flickering incandescence.
Something Like a Roman candle shot skyward in the distance.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Okay!' he said. 'If they want to trade, let's go push the deal
...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Abruptly, the house shuddered. The city lights blinked out. A
humming sound filled the air.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Martha Graham clutched her husband's arm. 'Ted! Wha - what was
that?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I dunno.' He turned. 'Mr Rush!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>No answer. Only the humming.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The door at the end of the room opened. A strange man came
through it. He wore a short toga-like garment of gray, metallic
cloth belted at the waist by something that glittered and shimmered
through every color of the spectrum. An aura of coldness and power
emanated from him - a sense of untouchable hauteur.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He glanced around the room, spoke in the same tongue the Rushes
had used.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ted Graham said, 'I don't understand you, mister.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The man put a hand to his nickering belt. Both Ted and Martha
Graham felt themselves rooted to the floor, a tingling sensation
vibrating along every nerve.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Again the strange language rolled from the man's tongue, but now
the words were understood.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Who are you?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'My name's Graham. This is my wife. What's going -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'How did you get here?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The Rushes - they wanted to trade us this house for our
trailer. They brought us. Now look, we -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What is your talent - your occupation?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Tax accountant. Say! Why all these -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That was to be expected,' said the man. 'Clever! Oh,
excessively clever!' His hand moved again to the belt. 'Now be very
quiet. This may confuse you momentarily.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Colored lights filled both the Grahams' minds. They
staggered.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You are qualified,' said the man. 'You will serve.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Where are we?' demanded Martha Graham.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The coordinates would not be intelligible to you,' he said. 'I
am of the Rojac. It is sufficient for you to know that you are
under Rojac sovereignty.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ted Graham said, 'But -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You have, in a way, been kidnapped. And the Raimces have fled
to your planet - an unregistered planet.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm afraid,' Martha Graham said shakily.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You have nothing to fear,' said the man. 'You are no longer on
the planet of your birth - nor even in the same galaxy.' He glanced
at Ted Graham's wrist. 'That device on your wrist - it tells your
local time?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That will help in the search. And your sun - can you describe
its atomic cycle?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ted Graham groped in his mind for his science memories from
school, from the Sunday supplements. 'I can recall that our galaxy
is a spiral like -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Most galaxies are spiral.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Is this some kind of a practical joke?' asked Ted Graham.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The man smiled, a cold, superior smile. 'It is no joke. Now I
will make you a proposition.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ted nodded warily. 'All right, let's have the stinger.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The people who brought you here were tax collectors we Rojac
recruited from a subject planet. They were conditioned to make it
impossible for them to leave their job untended. Unfortunately,
they were clever enough to realize that if they brought someone
else in who could do their job, they were released from their
mental bonds. Very clever.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But-'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You may have their job,' said the man. 'Normally, you would be
put to work in the lower echelons, but we believe in meting out
justice wherever possible. The Raimces undoubtedly stumbled on your
planet by accident and lured you into this position without -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'How do you know I can do your job?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That moment of brilliance was an aptitude test. You passed.
Well, do you accept?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What about our baby?' Martha Graham worriedly wanted to
know.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You will be allowed to keep it until it reaches the age of
decision - about the time it will take the child to reach adult
stature.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Then what?' insisted Martha Graham.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The child will take its position in society - according to its
ability.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Will we ever see our child after that?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Possibly.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ted Graham said, 'What's the joker in this?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Again the cold, superior smile. 'You will receive conditioning
similar to that which we gave the Raimces. And we will want to
examine your memories to aid us in our search for your planet. It
would be good to find a new inhabitable place.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Why did they trap us like this?' asked Martha Graham.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It's lonely work,' the man explained. 'Your house is actually a
type of space conveyance that travels along your collection route -
and there is much travel to the job. And then - you will not have
friends, nor time for much other than work. Our methods are
necessarily severe at times.'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>'Travel?'</EM> Martha Graham repeated in dismay.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Almost constantly.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Ted Graham felt his mind whirling. And behind him, he heard his
wife sobbing.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The Raimces sat in what had been the Grahams' trailer.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'For a few moments, I feared he would not succumb to the bait,'
she said. 'I knew you could never overcome the mental compulsion
enough to leave them there without them first agreeing.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Raimce chuckled. 'Yes. And now I'm going to indulge in
everything the Rojac never permitted. I'm going to write ballads
and poems.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And I'm going to paint,' she said. 'Oh, the delicious
freedom!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Greed won this for us,' he said. 'The long study of the Grahams
paid off. They couldn't refuse to trade.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I knew they'd agree. The looks in their eyes when they saw the
house! They both had ...' She broke off, a look of horror coming
into her eyes. 'One of them did not agree I'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They both did. You heard them.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The baby?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He stared at his wife. 'But - but it is not at the age of
decision.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'In perhaps eighteen of this planet's years, it <EM>will</EM> be
at the age of decision. What then?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>His shoulders sagged. He shuddered. 'I will not be able to fight
it off. I will have to build a transmitter, call the Rojac and
confess!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And they will collect another inhabitable place,' she said, her
voice flat and toneless.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I've spoiled it,' he said. 'I've spoiled it!'</P>

<P> </P>
<P>The morning the space armor problem fell into the agency's lap,
Gwen Everest had breakfast at her regular restaurant, an automated
single-niche place catering to bachelor girls. Her order popped out
of the slot onto her table, and immediately the tabletop
projecta-menu switched to selling Interdorma's newest Interpretive
Telelog.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Your own private dream translator! The secret companion to
every neurosis!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen stared at the inch-high words doing a skitter dance above
her fried eggs. She had written that copy. Her food beneath the ad
looked suddenly tasteless. She pushed the plate away.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Along the speedwalk into Manhattan a <EM>you-seeker,</EM> its
roboflier senses programmed to her susceptibilities, flew beside
her ear. It was selling a year's supply of Geramyl - 'the breakfast
drink that helps you LIVE longer!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>In sudden anger, she turned on the roboflier, whispered a code
phrase she had wheedled from an engineer who serviced the things.
The roboflier darted upward in sudden erratic flight, crashed into
the side of a building.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A small break in her control. A beginning.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Waiting for Gwen along the private corridor to the
Single-master, Hucksting and Battlemont executive offices were
displays from the recent Religion of the Month Club campaign. She
ran a gamut of adecals, layouts, slogans, projos, quartersheets,
skinnies. The works.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Subscribe now and get these religions absolutely FREE! Complete
text of the Black Mass plus Abridged Mysticism!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>She was forced to walk through an adecal announcing: 'Don't be
Half Safe! Believe in Everything! Are you sure that African Bantu
Witchcraft is not the True Way?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>At the turn of the corridor stood a male-female graphic with
flesh-stimulant skinnies and supered voices, 'Find peace through
Tantrism.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The skinnies made her flesh crawl.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen fled into her office, slumped into her desk chair. With
mounting horror, she realized that she had either written or
supervised the writing of every word, produced every selling idea
along that corridor.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The interphon on her desk emitted its fluted 'Good morning.' She
slapped the blackout switch to keep the instrument from producing
an image. The last thing she wanted now was to see one of her
co-workers.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Who is it?' she barked.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Gwen?' No mistaking that voice: Andre Battlement, bottom name
on the agency totem.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What do you want?' she demanded.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Our Gwenny is feeling nasty this morning, isn't she?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh, Freud!' She slapped the disconnect, leaned forward with
elbows on the desk, put her face in her hands. <EM>Let's face
it,</EM> she thought, <EM>I'm 48, unmarried, and a prime mover in
an industry that's strangling the universe. I'm a professional
strangler.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Good morning,' fluted the interphon.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>She ignored it.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'A strangler,' she said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen recognized the basic problem here. She had known it since
childhood. Her universe was a continual replaying of 'The Emperor's
New Suit.' She saw the nakedness.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Good morning' fluted the interphon.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>She dropped her right hand away from her face, flicked the
switch. 'Now what?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Did you cut me off, Gwen?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What if I did?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Gwen, please! We have a problem.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We always have problems.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont's voice dropped one octave. 'Gwen. This is a Big
problem.'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Uncanny the way he can speak capital letters,</EM> she
thought. She said: 'Go away.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You've been leaving your Interdorma turned off!' accused
Battlemont. 'You mustn't. Neurosis can creep up on you.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Is that why you called me?' she asked,</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Of course not.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Then go away.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont did a thing then that everyone from Singlemaster on
down knew was dangerous to try with Gwen Everest. He pushed the
override to send his image dancing above her interphon.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>After the momentary flash of anger, Gwen correctly interpreted
the act as one of desperation. She found herself intrigued. She
stared at the round face, the pale eyes (definitely too small,
those eyes), the pug nose and wide gash of mouth above almost no
chin at all.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Plus the hairline in full retreat.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Andre, you are a mess,' she said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He ignored the insult. Still speaking in the urgency octave, he
said: 'I have called a full staff meeting. You must attend at
once.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Why?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'There are two military people in there, Gwen.' He gulped. 'It's
desperate. Either we solve their problem or they will ruin us. They
will draft every man in the agency!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Even you?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>She moved her right hand toward the interphon's emergency
disconnect. 'Good-by, Andre.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Gwen! My God! You can't let me down at a time like this!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Why not?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He spoke in breathless haste. 'We'll raise your salary. A bonus.
A bigger office. More help.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You can't afford me now,' she said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm begging you, Gwen. Must you abuse me?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>She closed her eyes, thought: <EM>The insects! The damned little
insects with their crummy emotions! Why can't I tell them all to go
to composite hell?</EM> She opened her eyes, said: 'What's the
military's flap?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlement mopped his forehead with a pastel blue handkerchief.
'It's the Space Service,' he said. 'The female branch. The WOMS.
Enlistments have fallen to almost nothing.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>She was interested in spite of herself. 'What's happened?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Something to do with the space armor. I don't know. I'm so
upset.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Why have they tossed it into our laps like this? The ultimatum,
I mean.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont glanced left and right, leaned forward. 'The
grapevine has it they're testing a new theory that creative people
work better under extreme stress.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The Psychological Branch again,' she said. 'Those
jackasses!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But what can we do?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Hoist 'em,' she said. 'You run along to the conference.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And you'll be there, Gwen?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'In a few minutes.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Don't delay too long, Gwen.' Again he mopped his forehead with
the blue handkerchief. 'Gwen, I'm frightened.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And with good reason.' She squinted at him. 'I can see you now:
Nothing on but a lead loincloth, dumping fuel into a radioactive
furnace. Freud, what a picture!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'This is no joke, Gwen!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I know.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You <EM>are</EM> going to help?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'In my own peculiar way, Andre.' She hit the emergency
disconnect.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Andre Battlemont turned away from his interphon, crossed his
office to a genuine Moslem prayer rug. He sat down on it facing the
floor-to-ceiling windows that looked eastward across midtown
Manhattan. This was the 1479th floor of the Stars of Space
building, and it was quite a view out there whenever the clouds
lifted. But the city remained hidden beneath a low ceiling this
morning. Up here it was sunny, though - except in Battlement's
mood. A fear-cycle ululated along his nerves.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>What he was doing on the prayer rug was practicing Yoga
breathing to calm those nerves. The military could wait. They
<EM>had</EM> to wait. The fact that he faced the general direction
of Mecca was left over from two months before. Yoga was a month
old. There was always some carry-over.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont had joined the Religion of the Month Club almost a
year ago - seduced by his own agency's deep motivation campaign
plus the Brotherhood Council's seal of approval. This month it was
the Reinspired Neo-Cult of St Freud. A test adecal superimposed
itself on the cloud-floor view beneath him. It began playing the
latest Gwen-Everest-inspired pitch of the IBMausoleum. Giant
rainbow letters danced across the fleecy background.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Make your advice immortal! Let us store your voice and thought
patterns in everlasting electronic memory circuits! When you are
gone, your loved ones may listen to your voice as you answer their
questions exactly the way you would most likely have answered them
in Life!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont shook his head. The agency, fearful of its dependence
on the live Gwen Everest, had secretly recorded her at a staff
conference once. Very illegal. The unions were death on it. But the
IBMausoleum had broken down with the first question put to Gwen's
ghost-voice.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Some people have thought patterns that are too complex to
permit accurate psyche-record,' the engineer explained.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont did not delude himself. The sole genius of the
agency's three owners lay in recognizing the genius of Gwen
Everest. She <EM>was</EM> the agency.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>It was like riding the tiger to have such an employee.
Singlemaster, Hucksting and Battlemont had ridden this tiger for 22
years. Battlemont closed his eyes, pitched her in his mind: a tall,
lean woman, but with a certain grace. Her face was long, dominated
by cold blue eyes, framed in waves of auburn hair. She had a wit
that could slash you to ribbons, and that priceless commodity: the
genius to pull selling sense out of utter confusion. Battlemont
sighed.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He was in love with Gwen Everest. Had been for 22 years. It was
the reason he had never married. His Interdorma explained that it
was because he wanted to be dominated by a strong woman. But that
only explained. It didn't help.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>For a moment, he thought wistfully of Singlemaster and Hucksting
both taking their annual three-month vacation at the geriatrics
center on Oahu. Battlemont wondered if he dared ask Gwen to take
her vacation with him. Just once.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>No.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He realized what a pitiful figure he made on the prayer rug.
Pudgy little man in a rather unattractive blue suit.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Tailors did things for him that they called 'improving your good
points.' But except when he viewed himself in a Vesta-Mirror to see
the sample clothes projected back onto his own idealized image, he
could never pin down what those good points were.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen would certainly turn him down.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He feared that more than anything. As long as there remained the
possibility ...</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Memory of the waiting Space Service deputation intruded.
Battlemont trembled, broke the Yoga breathing pattern The exercise
was having its usual effect: a feeling of vertigo. He heaved
himself to his feet.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'One cannot run away from fate,' he muttered.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>That was a carry-over from the Karma month.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>According to Gwen the agency's conference room had been copied
from a Florentine bordello's Emperor Room. It was a gigantic space.
The corners were all flossy curliques in heavy gilding an effect
carried over into deep carvings on the wall panels. The ceiling was
a mating of Cellini cupids with Dali landscapes.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Period stuff. Antique.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Into this baroque setting had been forced a one-piece table 6
feet wide and 42 feet long. It was an enlarged bit of Twentieth
Century Wailstreetiana fenced in by heavy wooden chairs. Beanbag
paper-weights and golden wheel ashtrays graced every place.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The air of the room was blue with the smoke of mood-cigs. ('It
rhymes with Good Bigs!') The staff seated around the table was
fighting off the depressant effect of the two Space Service
generals, one male and one female, sealed in flanking positions
beside Battlement's empty chair. There was a surprising lack of
small talk and paper rustling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>All staff members had learned of the ultimatum via the office
grapevine.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont slipped in his side door, crossed to his chair at the
end of the table, dropped into it before his knees gave out. He
stared from one frowning military face to the other.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>No response.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He cleared his throat. 'Sorry I'm ... ah ... Pressing business.
Unavoidable.' He cast a frantic glance around the table. No sign of
Gwen. He smiled at one officer, the other.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>No response.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>On his right sat Brigadier General Sonnet Finnister of the WOMS
(Women of Space). Battlemont had been appalled to see her walk.
Drill-sergeant stride. No nonsense. She wore a self-designed
uniform: straight pleated skirt to conceal bony hips, a loose
blouse to camouflage lack of upper development, and a long cape to
confuse the whole issue. Atop her head sat a duck-billed,
flat-fronted cap that had been fashioned for the single purpose of
hiding the Sonnet Finnister forehead, which went too high and too
wide.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>She seldom removed the hat.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>(This particular hat, Battlement's hurried private
investigations had revealed, looked hideous on every other member
of the WOMS. To a woman, they called it 'the Sonnet Bonnet'. There
had been the additional information that the general herself was
referred to by underlings as 'Sinister Finnister' - partly because
of the swirling cape.)</P>
<P> </P>
<P>On Battlemont's left sat General Nathan Owling of the Space
Engineers. Better known as 'Howling Owling' because of a
characteristic evidenced when he became angry. He appeared to have
been shaped in the officer caste's current mold of lean, blond
athlete. The blue eyes reminded Battlemont of Gwen's eyes, except
that the man's appeared colder.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>If that were possible.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Beyond Owling sat Leo Prim, the agency's art director. He was a
thin young man, thin to a point that vibrated across the edge of
emaciation. His black hair, worn long, held a natural wave. He had
a narrow Roman nose, soulful brown eyes, strong cleft in the chin,
generous mouth with large lips. A mood-cig dangled from the
lips.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>If Battlemont could have chosen his own appearance, he would
have liked to look like Leo Prim. Romantic. Battlemont caught
Prim's attention, ventured a smile of camaraderie.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>No response.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>General Sonnet Finnister tapped a thin finger on the tabletop.
It sounded to Battlemont like the slack drum of a death march.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Hadn't we better get started?' demanded Finnister.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Are we all here - finally?' asked Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont swallowed past a lump in his throat. 'Well ... ah ...
no ... ah ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Owling opened a briefcase in his lap, glanced at an intelligence
report, looked around the table. 'Miss Everest is missing,' he
announced.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister said: 'Couldn't we go ahead without her?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We'll wait,' said Owling. He was enjoying himself. <EM>Damned
parasites need a touch of the whip now and then!</EM> he thought.
<EM>Shows 'em where they stand.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister glared at Owling a hawk stare that had reduced full
colonels (male) to trembling. The stare rolled off Owling without
effect. <EM>Trust the high command to pair me with a male supremacy
type like Owling! she</EM> thought.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Is this place safe from snooping?' asked Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlement turned his own low-wattage glare on the staff seated
in the mood smoke haze around the table. No glance met his. 'That's
all anybody ever does around here!' he snapped.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What?' Owling started to rise.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Busybodies!' blared Battlement. 'My whole staff!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ohhh.' Owling sank back into his chair. 'I meant a different
kind of snooping.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh, that.' Battlemont shrugged, suppressed an urge to glance up
at the conference room's concealed recorder lenses. 'We cannot have
our ideas pirated by other agencies, you know. Absolutely safe
here.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen Everest chose this moment for her entrance. All eyes
followed her as she came through the end door, strode down the
length of the room.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont admired her grace. Such a feminine woman in spite of
her strength. So different from the female general.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen found a spare chair against the side wall, crowded it in
between Battlemont and Finnister.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The commander of the WOMS glared at the intruder. 'Who are
<EM>you?'</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont leaned forward. 'This is Miss Everest, our ... ah ...
' He hesitated, confused, Gwen had never had an official title with
the agency. Never needed it. Everyone in the place knew she was the
boss. 'Ahh ... Miss Everest is our ... ah ... director of
coordination,' said Battlemont.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Why! That's a wonderful title!' said Gwen. 'I must get it
printed on my stationery.' She patted Battlement's hand, faced him
and, in her best undercover-agent-going-into-action voice, said:
'Let's have it, Chief. Who are these people? What's going on?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>General Owling nodded to Gwen. 'I'm Owling, General, Space
Engineers.' He gestured to the rocket splash insignia on his
shoulder. 'My companion is General Finnister, WOMS.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen had recognized the famous Finnister face. She smiled
brightly, said: 'General Woms!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Finnister!' snapped the female general.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes, of course,' said Gwen. 'General Finnister Woms. Must not
go too informal, you know.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister spoke in slow cadence: 'I ... am ... General ...
Sonnet ... Finnister ... of ... the ... Women ... of ... Space! The
WOMS!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh, how stupid of me,' said Gwen. 'Of course you are.' She
patted the general's hand, smiled at Battlemont.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont, who well knew the falsity of this mood in Gwen
Everest, was trying to scrunch down out of sight in his chair.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>In that moment, Gwen realized with a twinge of fear that she had
reached a psychic point of no return. Something slipped a cog in
her mind. She glanced around the table. Familiar faces leaped at
her with unreal clarity. Staring eyes. (The best part of a
conference was to watch Gwen in action.) <EM>I can't take any more
of this,</EM> thought Gwen. <EM>I have to declare myself.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>She focused on the military. The rest of the people in this room
owned little pieces of her, but not these two. Owling and
Finnister. Space generals. Symbols. Targets!</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Let the chips fall where they may! Fire when ready, Gridley.
Shoot if you must this old gray head ... Wait until you see the
whites of their eyes.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen nodded to herself.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>One misstep and the agency was ruined.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Who cares?</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>It all passed in a split second, but the decision was made.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Rebellion!</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen turned her attention on Owling. 'Would you be kind enough
to end this stalling around and get the meeting under way?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Stall ...' Owling broke it off. The intelligence report had
said Gwen Everest was fond of shock tactics. He gave her a curt
nod, passed the nod to Finnister.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The female general addressed Battlemont. 'Your agency, as we
explained to you earlier, has been chosen for a vital task, Mr
Battlefield.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Battlemont,' said Gwen.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister stopped short. 'What?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'His name is Battlemont, not Battlefield,' said Gwen.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What of it?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Names are important,' said Gwen. I'm sure you appreciate
this.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The Finnister cheeks flushed. 'Quite!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Owing stepped into the breach. 'We are authorized to pay this
agency double the usual fee for performance,' he said. 'However, if
you fail us we'll draft every male employee here into the Space
service</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What an asinine idea!' said Gwen. 'Our people would destroy the
Space Service. From within.' Again she smiled at Battlemont.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Andre here could do it all by himself. Couldn't you, ducky?'
She patted Battlemont's cheek.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont tried to crouch farther down into the chair. He
avoided the eyes of the space brass, said : 'Gwen ... please.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What do you mean, destroy the Space Service?' demanded
Finnister.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen ignored her, addressed Owling. 'This is another one of the
Psych Branch's brainstorms,' she said. 'I can smell the stench of
'em in every word.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Owling frowned. As a matter of fact, he had the practical
builder's suspicion of everything subjective. This Everest woman
made a good point there. But the military had to stand shoulder to
shoulder against outsiders. He said: 'I don't believe you are
properly equipped to fathom military tactics. Let's get on to the
problem we ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Military tactics yet!' Gwen rapped the table. 'Deploy your
forces, men. This is it! Synchronize your watches. Over the
top!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Gwen!' said Battlemont.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Of course,' said Gwen. She faced Finnister. 'Would you mind
awfully outlining your problem in simple terms that our
un-militarized minds could understand?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A pause, a glare. Finnister spewed her words through stiff lips.
'Enlistments in the WOMS have fallen to an alarming degree.
<EM>You</EM> are going to correct this.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Behind Gwen, Battlemont nodded vigorously.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Women can release men for the more strenuous tasks,' said
Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And there are many things women can do that men cannot do,'
said Finnister.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Absolutely essential,' said Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Absolutely,' agreed Finnister.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Can't draft women, I suppose,' said Gwen.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Tried to get a bill through,' said Owling. 'Damned committee's
headed by an anti-military woman.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Good for her,' said Gwen.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You do <EM>not</EM> sound like the person for this job,' said
Owling. 'Perhaps ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh, simmer down,' said Gwen.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Miss Everest is the best in the business,' said Battlemont.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen said: 'Why are enlistments down? You've run the usual
surveys, I suppose.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It's the space armor,' said Finnister. 'Women don't like
it.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Too mechanical,' said Owling. Too practical.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We need ... ah ... glamor,' said Finnister. She adjusted the
brim of her cap.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen frowned at the cap, cast a glance up and down the Finnister
uniform. 'I've seen the usual news pictures of the armor,' she
said. 'What do they wear underneath it? Something like your
uniform?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister suppressed a surge of anger. 'No. They wear special
fatigues.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The armor cannot be removed while they are in space,' said
Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh?' said Gwen. 'What about physical functions, that sort of
thing?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Armor takes care of everything,' said Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Apparently not <EM>quite</EM> everything,' murmured Gwen. She
nodded to herself, mulling tactics.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont straightened, sniffed the atmosphere of the
conference room. Staff all alert, quiet, attentive. Mood had
lightened somewhat. Gwen appeared to be taking over. Good old Gwen.
Wonderful Gwen. No telling what she was up to. As usual. She'd
solve this thing, though. Always did. Unless ...</P>
<P> </P>
<P>He blinked. Could she be toying with them? He tried to imagine
Gwen's thought patterns. Impossible. IBMausoleum couldn't even do
it. Unpredictable. All Battlemont could be certain of was that Gwen
would get a gigantic belly laugh from the picture of the agency's
male staff members drafted, slaving away on space freighters.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont trembled.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>General Finnister was saying: 'The problem is not one of getting
women to enlist for Earth-based service. We need them in the ships,
the asteroid stations, the ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Let's get this straight,' said Gwen. 'My
great-great-grandmother was in some kind of armed service. I read
her diary once. She called it the 'whackies' or something like
that.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'WACS,' said Finnister.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes,' said Gwen. 'It was during the war with Spain.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Japan,' said Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What I'm driving at is, why all the sudden interest in women?
My great-great-grand-mother had one merry old time running away
from some colonel who wanted ... Well, you know. Is this some kind
of a dodge to provide women for your space colonels?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister scowled her blackest.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Quickly suppressed chuckles sounded around the table.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Owling decided to try a new tack. 'My dear lady, our motives are
of the highest. We need the abilities of women so that mankind can
march side by side to the stars.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen stared at him in open admiration. 'Go-wan!' she said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I mean it,' said Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You're a poet!' said Gwen. 'Oh ... and I've wronged you. Here I
was - dirty-minded me - thinking you wanted women for base
purposes. And all the time you wanted <EM>companions.</EM> Someone
to share this glorious new adventure.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Again, Battlemont recognized the danger signals. He tried to
squeeze himself into as small a target as possible. Most of the
staff around the table saw the same signals, but they were intent,
fascinated.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Exactly!' boomed Finnister.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen's voice erupted in an angry snarl: 'And we name all the
little bastards after the stars in Virgo, ehhh?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>It took a long moment for Finnister and Owling to see that they
had been gulled. Finnister started to rise.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Siddown!' barked Gwen. She grinned. She was having a
magnificent time. Rebellion carried a sense of euphoria.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Owling opened his mouth, closed it without a howl.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister sank back into her chair.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Shall we get down to business?' snapped Gwen. 'Let's look at
this glorified hunk of tin you want us to glamorize.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister found something she could focus her shocked attention
on. 'Space armor is mostly plastic, not tin.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Plastic-schmastic,' said Gwen. 'I want to see your Iron
Gertie.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>General Owling took two deep breaths to calm his nerves, snapped
open the briefcase, extracted a folder of design sketches. He
pushed them toward Gwen - a hesitant motion as though he feared she
might take his hand with them. He now recognized that the
incredible intelligence report was correct: this astonishing female
was the actual head of the agency.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Here's - Iron Gertie,' he said, and forced a chuckle.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen leafed through the folder while the others watched.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont stared at her. He realized something the rest of the
staff did not: Gwen Everest was not being the usual Gwen Everest.
There was a subtle difference. An abandon. Something was
<EM>very</EM> wrong!</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Without looking up from the drawings, Gwen addressed herself to
Finnister. 'That uniform you're wearing, General Finnister. You
design that yourself?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What? Oh, yes. I did.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont trembled.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen reached out, rapped one of Finnister's hips. 'Bony,' she
said. She turned a page in the folder, shook her head.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Well!' exploded Finnister.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Still without looking up, Gwen said: 'Simmer down. How about the
hat? You design that, too?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yesss!' It was a sibilant explosion.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen lifted her attention to the hat, spoke in a reasonable
tone: 'Possibly the most hideous thing I've ever seen.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Well of all the-'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Are you a fashion designer?' asked Gwen politely.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister shook her head as though to clear it of cobwebs.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You are <EM>not</EM> a fashion designer?' pressed Gwen.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister bit the words off. 'I have had <EM>some</EM>
experience in choosing -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The answer is no, then,' said Gwen. 'Thought so.' She brought
her attention back to the folder, turned a page.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister glared at her in open-mouthed rage.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen glanced up at Owling. 'Why'd you put the finger on this
agency?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Owling appeared to have trouble focusing his attention on Gwen's
question. Presently, he said: 'You were ... it was pointed out that
this agency was one of the most successful in ... if not the most
successful ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We were classified as experts, eh?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes. If you want to put it that way.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I want to put it that way.' She glanced at Finnister. 'So we
let the experts do the designing, is that clear? You people keep
your greasy fingers off. Understood?' She shot a hard stare at
Owling, back to Finnister.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I don't know about you!' Finnister snapped at Owling, 'but I've
had all-'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'If you value your military career you'll just sit down and
listen,' said Gwen. Again, she glared at Owling. 'Do you
understand?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Owling shook his head from side to side. Amazement dominated
him. Abruptly, he realized that his head shaking could be
interpreted as negative. He bobbed his head up and down, decided in
mid-motion that this was undignified. He stopped, cleared his
throat.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>What an astonishing female!</EM> he thought.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen pushed the folder of design sketches uptable to Leo Prim,
the art director. 'Tell me, General Owling,' she said, 'why is the
armor so bulky?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Leo Prim, who had opened the folder, began to chuckle.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Marvelous, isn't it?' said Gwen.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Someone farther uptable asked: 'What is?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen kept her attention on Owling. 'Some jassack engineer in the
Space Service designed a test model suit of armor like a gigantic
woman - breasts and all.' She glanced at Finnister. 'You ran a
survey on the stupid thing, of course?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister nodded. She was shocked speechless.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I could've saved you the trouble,' said Gwen. 'One of the
reasons you'd better listen carefully to what <EM>expert me</EM>
has to say. No woman in her right mind would get into that thing.
She'd feel big - and she'd feel naked.' Gwen shook her head.
'Freud! What a combination!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Owling wet his lips with his tongue. 'Ah, the armor has to
provide sufficient shielding against radiation, and it must remain
articulate under extremes of pressure and temperature,' he said.
'It can't be made any smaller and still permit a human being to fit
into it.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Okay,' said Gwen. 'I have the beginnings of an idea.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>She closed her eyes, thought: <EM>These military jerks are a
couple of sitting ducks. Almost a shame to pot them.</EM> She
opened her eyes, glanced at Battlemont. His eyes were closed. He
appeared to be praying. <EM>Could be the ruination of poor Andre
and his lovely people, too,</EM> she thought. <EM>What a marvelous
collection of professional stranglers! Well, can't be helped. When
Gwen Everest goes out, she goes out in a blaze of glory! All flags
flying! Full speed ahead! Damn the torpedoes!</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Well?' said Owling.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Fire one!</EM> thought Gwen. She said: 'Presumably, you have
specialists, experts who can advise us on technical details.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'At your beck and call whenever you say the word,' said
Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont opened his eyes, stared at the back of Gwen's neck. A
ray of hope stabbed through his panic. Was it possible that Gwen
was really taking over?</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'll also want all the dope on which psychological types make
the best WOMS,' said Gwen. 'If there is such a thing as a best
WOM.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont closed his eyes, shuddered.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I don't believe I've ever been treated this high-handedly in my
entire career!' blurted Finnister. 'I'm not entirely sure that
-'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Just a moment, please,' said Owling. He studied Gwen, who was
smiling at him. The intelligence report said this woman was
'probable genius' and should be handled delicately.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm only sorry the law doesn't give us the right to draft
women, too!' barked Finnister.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Then you wouldn't really have this problem, would you?' asked
Gwen. She turned her smile on Finnister. It was full of
beatitudes.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Owling said: 'I know we have full authority to handle this at
our own discretion, General Finnister, and I agree that we've been
subjected to some abuse but ... '</P>
<P>'Abuse!' Finnister said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And high time, too,' said Gwen.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A violent shudder passed through Battlemont. He thought: <EM>We
are doomed!</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'However,' said Owling, 'we mustn't let our personal feelings
cloud a decision for the good of the service.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I hear the bugles blowing,' murmured Gwen.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'This agency <EM>was</EM> chosen as the one most likely to solve
the problem,' said Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'There <EM>could</EM> have been a mistake!' said Finnister.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Not likely.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You are determined to turn this thing over to ... to ...'
Finnister broke off, tapped her palms on the table top.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It's advisable,' said Owling. He thought: <EM>This Gwen Everest
will solve our problem. No problem could resist her. No problem
would dare!</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>General Owling had become a Gwenophile.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Very well, then,' snarled Finnister. 'I will reserve my
judgment.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>General Finnister had become a Gwenophobe.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Which was part of Gwen Everest's program.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I presume you two will be available for technical consultations
from time to time,' said Gwen.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Our subordinates take care of details,' said Owling. 'All
General Finnister and I are interested in is the big picture, the
key to the puzzle.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Big picture, key to puzzle,' mused Gwen. 'Wonderful idea.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What?' Owling stared at her, puzzled.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Nothing,' said Gwen. 'Just thinking out loud.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Owling stood up, looked at Finnister. 'Shall we be going?"</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister also stood up, turned toward the door at the end of
the room. 'Yesss!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Together, one on each side of the table, they inarched the
length of the room: tump-a-thump-a-tump-a-thump-a-tump ... Just as
they reached the door and Owling opened it, Gwen jumped to her
feet. 'Charrrge!' she shouted.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The two officers froze, almost turned, thought better of it.
They left, slamming the door.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont spoke plaintively into the silence. 'Gwen, why do you
destroy us?</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Destroy you? Don't be silly!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But, Gwen ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Please be quiet, Andre; you're interrupting my train of
thought.' She turned to Leo Prim. 'Leo, take those sketches and
things of that big-breasted Bertha they designed. I want adecal
workups on them, full projos, the entire campaign outlay.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Big Bertha adecals, projos, the outlay,' said Prim.
'Right!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Gwen, what are you doing?' asked Battlemont. 'You said yourself
that -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You're babbling, Andre,' said Gwen. She glanced up at the
ceiling. An eye in one of the Cellini cupids winked at her. 'We got
the usual solid recordings of this conference, I presume?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Of course,' said Battlemont.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Take those recordings, Leo,' said Gwen. 'Do a sequence out of
them featuring only General Sinister Sonnet Bonnet Finnister.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What'd you call her?' asked Prim.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen explained about the Finnister nicknames. 'The fashion trade
knows all about her,' she finished. 'A living horror.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yeah, okay,' said Prim. 'A solid sequence of nothing but
Finnister. What do you want it to show?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Every angle of that uniform,' said Gwen. 'And the hat, Freud!
Don't forget that hat!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont spoke plaintively. 'I don't understand.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Good,' said Gwen. 'Leo, send me Restivo and Jim Spark ... a
couple more of your best design people. Include yourself. We'll
...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And, lo! Ben Adam's name led all the rest,' said
Battlemont,</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen turned, stared down at him. For one of the rare times in
their association, Battlemont had surprised her with something he
said.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>I wonder if our dear Andre could be human?</EM> she mused.
<EM>No! I must be going soft in the head.</EM> She said: 'Andre, go
take a meditation break until time to call our next conference. Eh?
There's a good fellow.'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Always before when she abused me it was like a joke between
us,</EM> thought Battlemont dolefully. <EM>But now she is trying to
hurt.</EM> His concern now was for Gwen, not for the agency. <EM>My
Gwen needs help. And I don't know what to do.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Meditation break time,' said Gwen. 'Or you could go to a mood
bar. Why don't you try the new Interdorma mediniche? A niche in
time saves the mind!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I prefer to remain awake for our last hours together,' said
Battlemont. A sob clutched at his throat. He stood up to cover the
moment, drew himself to attention, fixed Gwen with a despairing
glare. 'I feel the future crouching over us like a great beast!' He
turned his back on her, strode out through his private door.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I wonder what the devil he meant by that?' mused Gwen.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Prim said: 'This is the month of St Freud. They go for
prescience, extrasensory perception, that sort of thing.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh, certainly,' she said. 'I wrote the brochure.' But she found
herself disturbed by Battlemont's departure. <EM>He looked so
pitiful,</EM> she thought. <EM>What if this little caper backfires
and he gets drafted? It could happen. Leo and the rest of these
stranglers could take it. But Andre ...</EM> She gave a mental
shrug. <EM>Too late to turn back now.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>Department heads began pressing toward Gwen along the table.
'Say, Gwen, what about the production on ...' 'If I'm going to meet
any deadlines I'll need more ... ' 'Will we have to drop our other
...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Shaddup!' bellowed Gwen.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>She smiled sweetly into the shocked silence. 'I will meet with
each of you privately, just as soon as I get in a fresh stock of
crying towels. First things first, though. Number one problem: we
get the monkey off our backs. Eh?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>And she thought: <EM>You poor oafs! You aren't even aware how
close you are to disaster. You think Gwen is taking over as usual.
But Gwen doesn't care. Gwen doesn't give a damn any more. Gwen is
resigning in a blaze of glory! Into the valley of death rode the
600! Or was it 400? No matter. War is hell! I only regret that I
have but one life to give for my agency. Give me liberty or give me
to the WOMS.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>Leo Prim said: 'You're going for the throat on these two
military types, is that it?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Military tactics,' said Gwen. 'No survivors! Take no prisoners!
Death to the White Eyes!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Huh?' said Prim.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Get right on that assignment I gave you,' she said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Uhh ...' Prim looked down at the folder Owling had left.
'Workups on this Big Bertha thing ... a solido on Finnister. Okay.'
He shook his head. 'You know, this business could shape up into a
Complete Flap.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It could be worse than that,' Gwen cautioned.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Someone else said: 'It's absolutely the worst I've ever seen.
Drafted!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>And Gwen thought: <EM>Ooooh! Someone has trepidations!</EM>
Abruptly, she said: 'Absolutely worst flap.' She brightened.
'That's wonderful! One moment, all you lovely people.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>There was sudden stillness in the preparations for
departure.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It has been moved that we label this business the Absolutely
Worst Flap,' she said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Chuckles from the staff.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You will note,' said Gwen, 'that the initials A-W-F are the
first three letters in the word <EM>awful.'</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>Laughter.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Up to now,' said Gwen, 'we've only had to content with Minor,
Medium and Complete Flaps. Now I give you the AWF! It rhymes with
the grunt of someone being slugged in the stomach!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Into the laughter that filled the room, Prim said: 'How about
the U and L in awful? Can't let them go to waste.'</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>'</EM>Un<EM>limited!'</EM> snapped Gwen. 'Absolutely Worst
Flap Unlimited!' She began to laugh, had to choke it off as the
laughter edged into hysteria. <EM>What in hell's wrong with
me?</EM> she wondered. She glared at Prim. 'Let's get cracking,
men! Isn't a damn one of you would look good in uniform.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The laughter shaded down into nervous gutterings. 'That
Gwen!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen had to get out of there. It was like a feeling of nausea.
She pushed her way down the side of the room. The sparkle had gone
out of her rebellion. She felt that all of these people were
pulling at her, taking bits of herself that she could never
recapture. It made her angry. She wanted to kick, bite, claw.
Instead, she smiled fixedly. 'Excuse me. May I get through here?
Sorry. Thank you. Excuse me.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>And an image of Andre Battlemont kept intruding on her
consciousness. <EM>Such a pitiful little fellow. So ... well ...
sweet-Dammit! Sweet! In a despicable sort of way.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Twenty-five days slipped off the calendar. Twenty-five days of
splashing in a pool of confusion. Gwen's element. She hurled
herself into the problem. This one had to be just right. A tagline
for her exit. A Gwen Everest signature at the bottom of the
page.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Technical experts from the military swarmed all through the
agency. Experts on suit articulation. Experts on shielding.
Pressure coefficients. Artificial atmosphere. Waste reclamation.
Sub-miniature power elements. A locksmith. An expert on the new
mutable plastics. <EM>(He</EM> had to be flown in from the West
Coast.)</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Plus the fashion experts seen only by Gwen.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>It was quite a job making sure that each military expert saw
only what his small technical world required.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Came the day of the Big Picture. The very morning.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Adjacent to her office Gwen maintained a special room about 20
feet square. She called it 'my intimidation room.' It was almost
Louis XV: insubstantial chairs, teetery little tables, glass
gimcracks on the light fixtures, pastel cherubs on the wall
panels.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The chairs looked as though they might smash flat under the
weight of a medium-sized man. Each (with the exception of a padded
throne chair that slid from behind a wall panel for Gwen) had a
seat that canted forward. The sitters kept sliding off, gently,
imperceptibly.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>None of the tables had a top large enough for a note pad
<EM>and</EM> an ashtray. One of these items had to be balanced in
the lap or placed underfoot. That forced an occasional look at the
carpet.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The carpet had been produced with alarming psychological
triggers. The uninitiated felt that they were standing upside down
in a fishbowl.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>General Owling occupied one of the trick chairs. He tried to
keep from staring at the cherub centered in a wall panel directly
across from him, slightly to the right of the seated figure of
Andre Battlemont. Battlement looked ill. Owling pushed himself
backward in the chair. His knees felt exposed. He glanced at
General Finnister. She sat to his right beyond a spindly table. She
pulled her skirt down as he watched. He wondered why she sat so far
forward on the chair.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Damned uncomfortable little chairs!</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>He noted that Battlemont had brought in one of the big
conference room chairs for himself. Owling wondered why they all
couldn't have those big, square, solid, secure chairs. For that
matter, why wasn't this meeting being held in the big conference
room? Full staff. The Big Picture! He glanced up at the wall panel
opposite. <EM>Stupid damned cherub!</EM> He looked down at the rug,
grimaced, tore his gaze away.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister had looked at the rug when she came into the room, had
almost lost her balance. Now, she tried to keep her attention off
it. Her mind seethed with disquieting rumors. Individual reports
from the technical experts failed to reveal a total image. It was
like a jigsaw puzzle with pieces from separate puzzles all thrown
together. She pushed herself backward in the chair. <EM>What an
uncomfortable room.</EM> Intuition told her the place was subtly
deliberate. Her latent anger at Gwen Everest flared. <EM>Where is
that woman?</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont cleared his throat, glanced at the door to his right
through which Gwen was expected momentarily. <EM>Must she always be
late?</EM> Gwen had avoided him for weeks. Too busy. Suddenly this
morning she had to have Andre Battlemont front and center. A
figurehead. A prop for her little show. He knew pretty much what
she was doing, too. In the outward, physical sense. She might be
able to keep things from some of the people around here, but Andre
Battlemont ran his own intelligence system. As to what was going on
in her mind, though, he couldn't be sure. All he knew was that it
didn't fit. Not even for Gwen.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister said: 'Our technical people inform us that you've been
pretty interested -' she pushed herself back in the chair - 'in the
characteristics of some of the newer mutable plastics.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That is true,' said Battlemont.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Why?' asked Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ahhh, perhaps we'd better wait for Miss Everest,' said
Battlemont. 'She is bringing a solido projector.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You have mockups already?' asked Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Good! How many models?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'One. Our receptionist. Beautiful girl.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What?' Finnister and Owling in unison.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh! You mean ... that is, we have the one to show you. It is
really two ... but only one of ...' He shrugged, suppressed a
shudder.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister and Owling looked at each other.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont closed his eyes. <EM>Gwen, please hurry.</EM> He
thought about her solution to the military problem, began to
tremble. Her basic idea was sound, of course. Good psychological
roots. But the military would never go for it. Especially that
female general who walked like a sergeant. Battlemont's eyes
snapped open as he heard a door open.</P>
<P>Gwen came in pushing a portable display projector. A glance of
mutual dislike passed between Gwen and Finnister, was masked by
mutual bright smiles immediately.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Good morning, everybody,' chirped Gwen.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Danger signal!</EM> thought Battlemont. <EM>She's mad!
She's</EM> ... He stopped the thought, focused on it. <EM>Maybe she
is. We work her so hard.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Anxious to see what you have there,' said Owling. 'Just getting
ready to ask for a progress report when you called this
meeting.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We wanted to have something first that you could appreciate as
an engineer,' said Gwen.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Owling nodded.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister said: 'Our people report that you've been very
secretive about your work. Why?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The very walls have ears. Loose lips lose the Peace! Don't be
half safe!' Gwen positioned the projector in the center of the
room, took the remote control, crossed to a panel which swung out
to disgorge her chair. She sat down facing Finnister and
Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Seconds dragged past while she stared in fascination at
Finnister's knees.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Gwen?' said Battlemont.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister tugged down on the hem of her skirt.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What do you have to show us?' demanded Owling. He pushed
himself back in the chair.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'First,' said Gwen, 'let us examine the perimeters of the
problem. You must ask yourself: What do young women want when they
enter the service?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Sounds sensible,' said Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister nodded, her dislike of Gwen submerged in attention to
the words.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'They want several things,' said Gwen. 'They want travel ...
adventure ... the knight errant sort of thing. Tally-ho!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont, Finnister and Owling snapped to shocked
attention.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Gives you pause when you think about it,' murmured Gwen. 'All
those women looking for something. Looking for the free ride. The
brass ring. The pot at the end of the rainbow.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>She had them nodding again, Gwen noted. She raised her voice:
'The old carousel! The jingle-dingle joy journey!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont looked at her sadly. <EM>Mad. Ohhh, my poor, poor
Gwenny.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>Owling said: 'I ... uh ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But they all want one commodity!' snapped Gwen. 'And what's
that? Romance! That's what's that. And in the unconscious mind
what's that romance? That romance is sex!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I believe I've heard enough,' said Finnister.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'No,' said Owling. 'Let's uh ... this is all, I'm sure,
preliminary. I want to know where ... after all, the model ...
models they've developed ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What's with sex when you get all the folderol off it?' demanded
Gwen. 'The psychological roots. What's down there?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Owling scratched his throat, stared at her. He had a basic
distrust of subjective ideas, but he always came smack up against
the fear that maybe (just maybe now) they were correct. Some of
them appeared (and it could be appearance <EM>only)</EM> to
work.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'll tell you what's down there,' muttered Gwen. 'Motherhood.
Home. Security with a man. The flag.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Owling thought: <EM>It all sounds so sensible ...
except&#8230;</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And what does your armor do?' asked Gwen. 'Armor equals no
amour! They're locked up in desexed chunks of metal and plastic
where no men can get at them. Great Freud! Men can't even see them
in there!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Women don't really <EM>want</EM> men to get at them!' barked
Finnister. 'Of all the disgusting ideas I've ever -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Just a minute!' said Gwen. 'A <EM>normal</EM> woman always
wants the <EM>possibility.</EM> That's what she wants. And she
wants it under <EM>her</EM> control. You've eliminated the
possibility. You've taken all control out of their hands, put your
women at the mercy of the elements, separated from cold, masculine,
angular ABRUPT AND FINAL DEATH! by only a thin layer of plastic and
metal.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont stared at her helplessly. <EM>Poor Gwen. Doomed. And
she won't even sell this idea. We're all doomed with her.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister glared at Gwen, still smarting under the implied dig
of the word <EM>normal.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'How do you propose to get around these, ah, objections?' asked
Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You'll see,' said Gwen. 'Let's go in from the perimeter now.
Remember, the basic female idea is to be able to run away with the
assurance that she will be caught. She wants a certain amount of
exposure as a female without being too bare-ahhh-faced about
it.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Mmmmph!' said Finnister.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen smiled at her.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Gwen is deliberately destroying herself and us with
her,</EM> thought Battlemont.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Do you see what is lacking?' asked Gwen.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Hninimm-ahhhhh-hmmmmm,' said Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'A universal symbol,' said Gwen. 'A bold symbol. A symbol!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What do you propose?' asked Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>That's it!' said Gwen. 'A proposal! Plus -' she hesitated - 'the
symbol! The key is very simple.' She sat up, perky, grinning at
them. 'In fact, it's a key!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister and Owling spoke in unison: 'A key?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes. Two keys, actually. Symbolism's obvious.' She produced two
keys from her jacket pocket, held them up. 'As you can see, one key
is hard, angular ... a masculine key. The other has fancy curves.
It's daintier, more the ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Do you mean to tell me,' howled Owling, 'that you people have
spent all these weeks, all those consultations with our experts,
and come up with ... with ... with ...' He pointed, unable to
continue.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen shook her head from side to side. 'Oh, no. Remember, these
are just symbols. They're important, of course. One might even say
they were vital. Each key will be inscribed with the name of the
person who gets it.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What are they keys to?' asked Finnister. She was fascinated in
spite of herself.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'To the space armor, naturally,' said Gwen. 'These keys lock
your people in their armor - both men <EM>and</EM> women.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Lock them?' protested Finnister. 'But you said ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I know,' said Gwen. 'But, you see, a key that will lock people
into something will also let them out. As a matter of fact, any one
of these keys will open any suit. That's for the safety
factor.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But they can't get <EM>out</EM> of their suits when they're in
space!' howled Owling. 'Of all the ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>That's right!' said Gwen. They can't <EM>really</EM> get out. So
we give them the <EM>symbol</EM> of getting out. For
exchanging.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Exchanging?' asked Finnister.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Certainly. A male astronaut sees a girl astronaut he likes. He
asks her to trade keys. Very romantic. Symbolic of things that
<EM>may</EM> happen when they return to Earth or get to a base
where they can get out of the suits.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Miss Everest,' said Finnister, 'as you so aptly pointed out
earlier, no astronaut can see one of our women in this armor. And
even if he could, I don't believe that I'd ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>She froze, staring, shocked speechless.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Owen had pushed a stud on the solido projector's remote control.
A suit of space armor appeared to be hanging in the center of the
room. In the suit, wearing a form-fitting jacket, stood the
agency's busty receptionist. The suit of armor around her was
transparent from the waist up.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The bottom half remains opaque at all times,' said Gwen. 'For
reasons of modesty ... the connections. However, the top half
...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen pushed another stud. The transparent upper half faded
through gray to black until it concealed the model.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'For privacy when desired,' said Gwen. 'That's how we've used
the new mutable plastic. Gives the girl some control over her
environment.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Again, Gwen pushed the first stud. The upper half of the model
reappeared.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister gaped at the form-fitting uniform.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen stood up, took a pointer, gestured in through the
projection. 'This uniform was designed by a leading couturier. It
is made to reveal while concealing. A woman with only a fair figure
will appear to good advantage in it. A woman with an excellent
figure appears stunning, as you can see. Poor figures -' Gwen
shrugged - 'there <EM>are</EM> exercises for developing them. Or so
I am told.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister interrupted in a cold voice. 'And what do you propose
to do with that ... that uni ... clothing?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>This will be the regulation uniform for the WOMS,' said Gwen.
There's a cute little hat goes with it. Very sexy.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont said: 'Perhaps the changeover could be made slowly so
as to ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What changeover?' demanded Finnister. She leaped to her feet.
'General Owling?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont thought: <EM>I knew it. Oh, my poor Gwenny! They will
destroy her, too. I knew it.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We can't waste any more time with this agency,' said Finnister.
'Come, General.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Wait!' yelped Battlemont. He leaped to his feet. 'Gwen, I told
you ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister said: 'It's regrettable, but ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Perhaps we're being a little hasty,' said Owling. 'There may be
something to salvage from this ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes!' said Battlemont. 'Just a little more time is all we need
to get a fresh ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I think not,' said Finnister.</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen smiled from one to the other, thought: <EM>What a prize lot
of gooney birds!</EM> She felt a little drunk, as euphoric as if
she had just come from a mood bar. <EM>Rebellion, it's wonderful!
Up the Irish! Or something.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>Owling shrugged, thought: <EM>We have to stand together
against</EM> <EM>civilians. General Finnister is right. Too bad,
though.</EM> He got to his feet.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Just a little more time,' pleaded Battlemont.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>Too bad about Andre,</EM> thought Gwen. She had an
inspiration, said: 'One moment, please.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Three pairs of eyes focused on her.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister said: 'If you think you can stop me from going through
with our threat, dissuade yourself. I'm perfectly aware that you
had that uni ... that <EM>clothing</EM> designed to make
<EM>me</EM> look hideous!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Why not?' asked Gwen. 'I was only doing to you what you did to
virtually every other woman in the WOMS.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Gwen!' pleaded Battlemont in horror.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Be still, Andre,' said Gwen. 'It's just a matter of timing,
anyway. Today. Tomorrow. Next week. Not really important.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh, my poor Gwenny,' sobbed Battlemont.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I was going to wait,' said Gwen. 'Possibly a week. At least
until I'd turned in my resignation.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What're you talking about?' asked Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Resignation!' gasped Battlemont.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I just can't toss poor Andre here to the wolves,' said Gwen.
'The rest of our men, yes. Once they get inside they'll chew your
guts out, anyway.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What <EM>are</EM> you talking about?' asked Finnister.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The rest of the men in this agency can take care of themselves
... and you, too,' said Gwen. 'Wolves among wolves. But Andre here
is helpless. All he has is his position ... money. He's an
accident. Put him someplace where money and position are less
important, it'll kill him.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Regrettable,' said Finnister. 'Shall we be going, General
Owling?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I was going to ruin both of you,' said Gwen. 'But I'll tell you
what. You leave Andre alone and I'll just give <EM>one</EM> of you
the business.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Gwen, what are you saying?' whispered Battlemont.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yesss!' hissed Finnister. 'Explain yourself!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I just want to know the pecking order here,' said Gwen. 'Which
one of you ranks the other?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What does that have to do with it?' asked Finnister.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Just a minute,' said Owling. 'That intelligence report.' He
glared at Gwen. 'I'm told you've prepared an adecal on the test
model we made before coming to you.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Big Bertha,' said Gwen. 'And it's not just an adecal. I have
everything needed for a full national campaign. Look!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A solido of the breast-bearing test model replaced the
transparent suit hanging in the center of the room.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'The idea for Big Bertha here originated with General Owling,'
said Gwen. 'My campaign establishes that fact, then goes on to
feature an animated model of Big Bertha. She is a living panic.
Funniest thing you ever saw. General Owling, you will be the
laughing stock of the nation by nightfall of the day I start this
campaign.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Owling took a step forward.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont said: 'Gwen! They will destroy you!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Owling pointed at the projection. 'You ... you wouldn't!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But I would,' said Gwen. She smiled at him.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont tugged at Gwen's arm. She shook him off.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'It would ruin me,' whispered Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Presumably, you are capable of going through with this threat,'
said Finnister. 'Regrettable.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Owling whirled on Finnister. 'We must stand together!' he said
desperately.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You bet,' said Gwen. She pushed another stud on the remote
control.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>A projection of General Finnister in her famous uniform replaced
Big Bertha.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You may as well know the whole story,' said Gwen. 'I'm all set
with another campaign on the designing of this uniform, right from
the Sonnet Bonnet on down through the Sinister Finnister cape and
those sneaky walking shoes. I start with a dummy model of the
general clad in basic foundation garments. Then I go on to show how
each element of the present WOMS uniform was designed for the ...
ah ... Finnister ... ah ... figure.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'll sue!' barked Finnister.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Go ahead. Go ahead.' Gwen waved a sinuous arm.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>She acts drunk!</EM> thought Battlemont. <EM>But she never
drinks.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm all set to go black market with these campaigns,' said
Gwen. 'You can't stop me. I'll prove every contention I make about
that uniform. I'll expose you. I'll show why your enlistment drives
flopped.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Red suffused the Finnister face. 'All right!' she snapped. 'If
you're going to ruin us, I guess there's nothing we can do about
it. But mark this, Miss Everest. We'll have the men of this agency
in the service. You'll have that on your conscience! And the men we
draft will serve under friends of ours. I hope you know what that
means!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You don't have any friends,' said Gwen, but her voice lacked
conviction. <EM>It's backfiring,</EM> she thought. <EM>Oh, hell. I
didn't think they'd defy me.</EM></P>
<P> </P>
<P>'There may even be something we can do about you!' said
Finnister. 'A presidential order putting you in the service for
reasons of national emergency. Or an emergency clause on some bill.
And when we get our hands on you, Miss Everest ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Andre!' wailed Gwen. It was all getting out of hand. <EM>I
didn't want to hurt anybody,</EM> she thought. <EM>I just ...</EM>
She realized that she didn't know what she <EM>had</EM> wanted.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Battlemont was electrified. In 22 years, Gwen Everest had never
appealed to anyone for help. And now, for the first time, her
appeal was to him! He stepped between Gwen and Finnister. 'Andre is
right here,' he said. He felt inspired. His Gwen had appealed to
him! 'You assassin!' he said, shaking a finger under the Finnister
nose.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Now, see here!' snapped Owling. 'I won't stand for any more
of-'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And you!' barked Battlemont, whirling. 'We have recordings of
every conference here, from the first, and including this one! They
show what happened! Don't you know what is wrong with this poor
girl? You! You've driven her out of her mind!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen joined in the chorus: 'What?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Be still, Gwen,' said Battlemont. 'I will handle this.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Gwen couldn't take her attention off him. Battlemont was
magnificent. 'Yes, Andre.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I will prove it,' said Battlemont. 'With Interdorma
psychiatrists. With all the experts money can buy. You think you
have seen something in those campaigns our Gwen set up? Hah! I will
show you something.' He stabbed a finger at Owling. 'Can the
military drive you insane?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh, now see here,' said Owling. 'This has gone -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes! It <EM>can</EM> drive you insane!' said Battlemont. 'And
we will show, step by step, how you drove our poor Gwen out of her
mind with fear for her friends. Fear for me!' He slapped himself on
the chest, glared at Finnister. 'And you know what we will do next?
We will say to the public: This could happen to you! Who is next?
You? Or you? Or you? Then what happens to your money from Congress?
What happens to your enlistment quotas?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Now see here,' said Owling. 'We didn't ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Didn't you?' snarled Battlemont. 'You think this poor girl is
in her right mind?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Well, but we didn't ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Wait until you see our campaign,' said Battlemont. He took
Gwen's hand, patted it. 'There, there, Gwenny. Andre will fix.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes, Andre,' she said. They were the only words she could find.
She felt stupefied. <EM>He's in love with me,</EM> she thought.
Never before had she known anyone to be in love with her. Not even
her parents, who had always been repelled by the intellect they had
spawned. Gwen felt warmth seeping through her. A cog slipped into
motion in her mind. It creaked somewhat from long idleness. She
thought: <EM>He's in love with me!</EM> She wanted to hug him.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'We seem to be at a stalemate,' muttered Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister said: 'But we can't just -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Shut up!' ordered Owling. 'He'll do it! Can't you see
that?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But if we draft-'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'He'll do it for sure, then! Buy some other agency to run the
campaign.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But we could turn around and draft -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You can't draft everybody who disagrees with you, woman! Not in
this country! You'd start a revolution!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I ...' Finnister said helplessly.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And it's not just us he'd ruin,' said Owling. 'The whole
service. He'd strike right at the money. I know his type. He wasn't
bluffing. It'd be catastrophic!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P class="c1">* * * *</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Owling shook his head, seeing a parade of crumbling military
projects pass before his mind's eye, all falling into an abyss
labeled 'NSF.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You are an intelligent man, General Owling,' said
Battlemont.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That Psych Branch!' snarled Owling. 'Them and their bright
ideas!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I told you they were fuzzy-heads,' said Gwen.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You be still, Gwen,' said Battlemont.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes, Andre.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Well, what're we going to do?' demanded Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I tell you what,' said Battlemont 'You leave us alone, we leave
you alone.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But what about my enlistments?' wailed Finnister.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You think our Gwen, sick or well, can't solve your problems?'
asked Battlemont. 'For your enlistments you use the program as
outlined.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I won't!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You will,' said Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'General Owling, I refuse to have ...'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What happens if I have to dump this problem on the General
Staff?' asked Owling. 'Where will the head-chopping start? In the
Psych Branch? Certainly. Who'll be next? The people who could've
solved it in the field, that's who!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister said: 'But -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'For that matter,' said Owling, 'Miss Everest's ideas sounded
pretty sensible ... with some modifications, of course.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'No modifications,' said Battlemont.</P>
<P><EM> </EM></P>
<P><EM>He's a veritable Napoleon!</EM> thought Gwen.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Only in minor, unimportant details,' soothed Owling. 'For
engineering reasons.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Perhaps,' agreed Battlemont. 'Provided we pass on the
modifications before they are made.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I'm sure we can work it out,' said Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Finnister gave up, turned her back on them.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'One little detail,' murmured Battlemont. 'When you make out the
double-fee check to the agency, make a substantial addition-bonus
for Miss Everest.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Naturally,' said Owling.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Naturally,' said Battlemont.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>When the space brass had departed, Battlemont faced Gwen,
stamped his foot. 'You have been very bad, Gwen!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But, Andre -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Resignation!' barked Battlemont.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'But -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Oh, I understand, Gwen. It's my fault. I worked you much too
hard. But that is past.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Andre, you don't -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes, I do! I understand. You were going to sink the ship and go
down with it. My poor, dear Gwen. A death wish! If you'd only paid
attention to your Interdorma Telelog.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I didn't want to hurt anyone here, Andre. Only those two -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes, yes. I know. You're all mixed up.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>That's true.' She felt like crying. She hadn't cried ... since
... she couldn't remember when. 'You know,' she said, 'I can't
remember ever crying.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'That's it!' said Battlemont. 'I cry all the time. You need a
stabilizing influence. You need someone to teach you how to
cry.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Would you teach me, Andre?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Would I ...' He wiped the tears from his eyes. 'You are going
on a vacation. Immediately! I am going with you.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Yes, Andre.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And when we return -'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I don't want to come back to the agency, Andre. I ...
can't.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'So that's it!' said Battlemont. 'The advertising business! It
bugs you!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>She shrugged. 'I'm ... I just can't face another campaign. I ...
just ... can't.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You will write a book,' announced Battlemont.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'What?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Best therapy known,' said Battlemont. 'Did it myself once. You
will write about the advertising business. You will expose all the
dirty tricks: the hypno-jingles, the subvisual flicker images, the
advertisers who finance textbooks to get their sell into them, the
womb rooms where the <EM>you-seekers</EM> are programmed.
Everything.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'I could do it,' she said.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You will tell all,' said Battlemont.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Will I!'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'And you will do it under a pseudonym,' said Battlemont.
'Safer.'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'When do we start the vacation, Andre?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Tomorrow.' He experienced a moment of his old panic. 'You don't
mind that I'm ... ugly as a pig?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'You're just beautiful,' she said. She smoothed the hair across
his bald spot. 'You don't mind that I'm smarter than you?'</P>
<P> </P>
<P>'Ah, hah!' Battlemont drew himself to attention. 'You may be
smarter in the head, my darling, but you are <EM>not</EM> smarter
in the heart!'</P>
