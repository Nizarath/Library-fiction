\par The morning the space armor problem fell into the agency's lap, Gwen Everest had breakfast at her regular restaurant, an automated single-niche place catering to bachelor girls. Her order popped out of the slot onto her table, and immediately the tabletop
 projecta-menu switched to selling Interdorma's newest Interpretive Telelog.
\par 'Your own private dream translator! The secret companion to every neurosis!'
\par Gwen stared at the inch-high words doing a skitter dance above her fried eggs. She had written that copy. Her food beneath the ad looked suddenly tasteless. She pushed the plate away.
\par Along the speedwalk into Manhattan a }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 you-seeker, }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
its roboflier senses programmed to her susceptibilities, flew beside her ear. It was selling a year's supply of Geramyl - 'the breakfast drink that helps you LIVE longer!'
\par In sudden anger, she turned on the roboflier, whispered a code phrase she had wheedled from an engineer who serviced the things. The roboflier darted upward in sudden erratic flight, crashed into the side of a building.
\par A small break in her control. A beginning.
\par Waiting for Gwen along the private corridor to the Single-master, Hucksting and Battlemont executive offices were displays from the recent Religion of the Month Club campaign. She ran a gamut of adecals,
 layouts, slogans, projos, quartersheets, skinnies. The works.
\par 'Subscribe now and get these religions absolutely FREE! Complete text of the Black Mass plus Abridged Mysticism!'
\par She was forced to walk through an adecal announcing: 'Don't be Half Safe! Believe in Everything! Are you sure that African Bantu Witchcraft is not the True Way?'
\par At the turn of the corridor stood a male-female graphic with flesh-stimulant skinnies and supered voices, 'Find peace through Tantrism.'
\par The skinnies made her flesh crawl.
\par Gwen fled into her office, slumped into her desk chair. With mounting horror, she realized that she had either written or supervised the writing of every word, produced every selling idea along that corridor.
\par The interphon on her desk emitted its fluted 'Good morning.' She slapped the blackout switch to keep-the instrument from producing an image. The last thing she wanted now was to see one of her co-workers.
\par 'Who is it?' she barked.
\par 'Gwen?' No mistaking that voice: Andre Battlement, bottom name on the agency totem.
\par 'What do you want?' she demanded.
\par 'Our Gwenny is feeling nasty this morning, isn't she?'
\par 'Oh, Freud!' She slapped the disconnect, leaned forward with elbows on the desk, put her face in her hands. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Let's face it, }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 she thought, }{
\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 I'm 48, unmarried, and a prime mover in an industry that's strangling the universe. I'm a professional strangler.}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par 'Good morning,' fluted the interphon.
\par She ignored it.
\par 'A strangler,' she said.
\par Gwen recognized the basic problem here. She had known it since childhood. Her universe was a continual replaying of 'The Emperor's New Suit.' She saw the nakedness.
\par 'Good morning' fluted the interphon.
\par She dropped her right hand away from her face, flicked the switch. 'Now what?'
\par 'Did you cut me off, Gwen?'
\par 'What if I did?'
\par 'Gwen, please! We have a problem.'
\par 'We always have problems.'
\par Battlemont's voice dropped one octave. 'Gwen. This is a Big problem.'
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Uncanny the way he can speak capital letters, }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 she thought. She said: 'Go away.'
\par 'You've been leaving your Interdorma turned off!' accused Battlemont. 'You mustn't. Neurosis can creep up on you.'
\par 'Is that why you called me?' she asked,
\par 'Of course not.'
\par 'Then go away.'
\par Battlemont did a thing then that everyone from Singlemaster on down knew was dangerous to try with Gwen Everest. He pushed the override to send his image dancing above her interphon.
\par 
\par After the momentary flash of anger, Gwen correctly interpreted the act a
s one of desperation. She found herself intrigued. She stared at the round face, the pale eyes (definitely too small, those eyes), the pug nose and wide gash of mouth above almost no chin at all.
\par Plus the hairline in full retreat.
\par 'Andre, you are a mess,' she said.
\par He ignored the insult. Still speaking in the urgency octave, he said: 'I have called a full staff meeting. You must attend at once.'
\par 'Why?'
\par 'There are two military people in there, Gwen.' He gulped. 'It's desperate. Either we solve their problem or they will ruin us. They will draft every man in the agency!'
\par 'Even you?"
\par 'Yes!'
\par She moved her right hand toward the interphon's emergency disconnect. 'Good-by, Andre.'
\par 'Gwen! My God! You can't let me down at a time like this!'
\par 'Why not?'
\par He spoke in breathless haste. 'We'll raise your salary. A bonus. A bigger office. More help.'
\par 'You can't afford me now,' she said.
\par 'I'm begging you, Gwen. Must you abuse me?'
\par She closed her eyes, thought: }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 The insects! The damned little insects with their crummy emotions! Why can't I tell them all to go to composite hell? }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
She opened her eyes, said: 'What's the military's flap?'
\par Battlement mopped his forehead with a pastel blue handkerchief. 'It's the Space Service,' he said. 'The female branch. The WOMS. Enlistments have fallen to almost nothing.'
\par She was interested in spite of herself. 'What's happened?'
\par 'Something to do with the space armor. I don't know. I'm so upset.'
\par 'Why have they tossed it into our laps like this? The ultimatum, I mean.'
\par Battlemont glanced left and right, leaned forward. 'The grapevine has it they're testing a new theory that creative people work better under extreme stress.'
\par 'The Psychological Branch again,' she said. "Those jackasses!'
\par 'But what can we do?'
\par 'Hoist 'em,' she said. 'You run along to the conference.'
\par 'And you'll be there, Gwen?'
\par 'In a few minutes.'
\par 'Don't delay too long, Gwen.' Again he mopped his forehead with the blue handkerchief. 'Gwen, I'm frightened.'
\par 'And with good reason.' She squinted at him. 'I can see you now: Nothing on but a lead loincloth, dumping fuel into a radioactive furnace. Freud, what a picture!'
\par "This is no joke, Gwen!'
\par 'I know.'
\par 'You }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 are }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 going to help?'
\par 'In my own peculiar way, Andre.' She hit the emergency disconnect.
\par 
\par And
re Battlemont turned away from his interphon, crossed his office to a genuine Moslem prayer rug. He sat down on it facing the floor-to-ceiling windows that looked eastward across midtown Manhattan. This was the 1479th floor of the Stars of Space building,
 and it was quite a view out there whenever the clouds lifted. But the city remained hidden beneath a low ceiling this morning. Up here it was sunny, though - except in Battlement's mood. A fear-cycle ululated along his nerves.
\par What he was doing on the prayer rug was practicing Yoga breathing to calm those nerves. The military could wait. They }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 had }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
to wait. The fact that he faced the general direction of Mecca was left over from two months before. Yoga was a month old. There was always some carry-over.
\par Battle
mont had joined the Religion of the Month Club almost a year ago - seduced by his own agency's deep motivation campaign plus the Brotherhood Council's seal of approval. This month it was the Reinspired Neo-Cult of St Freud. A test adecal superimposed itse
lf on the cloud-floor view beneath him. It began playing the latest Gwen-Everest-inspired pitch of the IBMausoleum. Giant rainbow letters danced across the fleecy background.
\par 'Make your advice immortal! Let us store your voice and thought patterns in everla
sting electronic memory circuits! When you are gone, your loved ones may listen to your voice as you answer their questions exactly the way you would most likely have answered them in Life!'
\par Battlemont shook his head. The agency, fearful of its dependence 
on the live Gwen Everest, had secretly recorded her at a staff conference once. Very illegal. The unions were death on it. But the IBMausoleum had broken down with the first question put to Gwen's ghost-voice.
\par 'Some people have thought patterns that are too complex to permit accurate psyche-record,' the engineer explained.
\par Battlemont did not delude himself. The sole genius of the agency's three owners lay in recognizing the genius of Gwen Everest. She }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 was }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 the agency.
\par It was like riding the tiger to have suc
h an employee. Single-master, Hucksting and Battlemont had ridden this tiger for 22 years. Battlemont closed his eyes, pitched her in his mind: a tall, lean woman, but with a certain grace. Her face was long, dominated by cold blue eyes, framed in waves o
f auburn hair. She had a wit that could slash you to ribbons, and that priceless commodity: the genius to pull selling sense out of utter confusion. Battlemont sighed.
\par He was in love with Gwen Everest. Had been for 22 years. It was the reason he had never married. His Interdorma explained that it was because he wanted to be dominated by a strong woman. But that only explained. It didn't help.
\par For a moment, he thought wistfully of Singlemaster and Hucksting both taking their annual three-month vacation at the geriatrics center on Oahu. Battlemont wondered if he dared ask Gwen to take her vacation with him. Just once.
\par No.
\par He realized what a pitiful figure he made on the prayer rug. Pudgy little man in a rather unattractive blue suit.
\par Tailors did things for him that they called 'improving your good points.' But except when he viewed himself in a Vesta-Mirror to see the sample clothes projected back onto his own idealized image, he could never pin down what those good points were.

\par Gwen would certainly turn him down.
\par He feared that more than anything. As long as there remained the possibility ...
\par Memory of the waiting Space Service deputation intruded. Battlemont trembled, broke the Yoga breathing pattern The exercise was having its usual effect: a feeling of vertigo. He heaved himself to his feet.
\par 'One cannot run away from fate,' he muttered.
\par That was a carry-over from the Karma month.
\par 
\par According to Gwen the agency's conference room ha
d been copied from a Florentine bordello's Emperor Room. It was a gigantic space. The corners were all flossy curliques in heavy gilding an effect carried over into deep carvings on the wall panels. The ceiling was a mating of Cellini cupids with Dali lan
dscapes.
\par Period stuff. Antique.
\par Into this baroque setting had been forced a one-piece table 6 feet wide and 42 feet long. It was an enlarged bit of Twentieth Century Wailstreetiana fenced in by heavy wooden chairs. Beanbag paper-weights and golden wheel ashtrays graced every place.

\par The air of the room was blue with the smoke of mood-cigs. ('It rhymes with Good Bigs!') The staff seated around the table was fighting off the depressant effect of the two Space Service generals, one male and one female, sealed in
 flanking positions beside Battlement's empty chair. There was a surprising lack of small talk and paper rustling.
\par All staff members had learned of the ultimatum via the office grapevine.
\par Battlemont slipped in his side door, crossed to his chair at the end of the table, dropped into it before his knees gave out. He stared from one frowning military face to the other.
\par No response.
\par He cleared his throat. 'Sorry I'm ... ah ... Pressing business. Unavoidable.' He cast a frantic glance around the table. No sign of Gwen. He smiled at one officer, the other.
\par No response.
\par On his right sat Brigadier General Sonnet Finnister of the WOMS (Women of Space). Battlemont had been appalled to see her walk. Drill-sergeant stride. No nonsense. She wore a self-designed uniform:
 straight pleated skirt to conceal bony hips, a loose blouse to camouflage lack of upper development, and a long cape to confuse the whole issue. Atop her head sat a duck-billed, flat-fronted cap that had been fashioned for the single purpose of hiding th
e Sonnet Finnister forehead, which went too high and too wide.
\par She seldom removed the hat.
\par (This particular hat, Battlement's hurried private investigations had revealed, looked hideous on every other member of the WOMS. To a woman, they called it 'the Sonn
et Bonnet'. There had been the additional information that the general herself was referred to by underlings as 'Sinister Finnister' - partly because of the swirling cape.)
\par On Battlemont's left sat General Nathan Owling of the Space Engineers. Better known
 as 'Howling Owling' because of a characteristic evidenced when he became angry. He appeared to have been shaped in the officer caste's current mold of lean, blond athlete. The blue eyes reminded Battlemont of Gwen's eyes, except that the man's appeared c
older.
\par If that were possible.
\par Beyond Owling sat Leo Prim, the agency's art director. He was a thin young man, thin to a point that vibrated across the edge of emaciation. His black hair, worn long, held a natural wave. He had a narrow Roman nose, soulful br
own eyes, strong cleft in the chin, generous mouth with large lips. A mood-cig dangled from the lips.
\par If Battlemont could have chosen his own appearance, he would have liked to look like Leo Prim. Romantic. Battlemont caught Prim's attention, ventured a smile of camaraderie.
\par No response.
\par General Sonnet Finnister tapped a thin finger on the tabletop. It sounded to Battlemont like the slack drum of a death march.
\par 'Hadn't we better get started?' demanded Finnister.
\par 'Are we all here - finally?' asked Owling.
\par Battlemont swallowed past a lump in his throat. 'Well ... ah ... no ... ah ... '
\par Owling opened a briefcase in his lap, glanced at an intelligence report, looked around the table. 'Miss Everest is missing,' he announced.
\par Finnister said: 'Couldn't we go ahead without her?'
\par 'We'll wait,' said Owling. He was enjoying himself. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Damned parasites need a touch of the whip now and then! }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 he thought. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
Shows 'em where they stand.}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par 
\par Finnister glared at Owling a hawk stare that had reduced full colonels (male) to trembling. The stare rolled off Owling without effect. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
Trust the high command to pair me with a male supremacy type like Owling! she }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 thought.
\par 'Is this place safe from snooping?' asked Owling.
\par Battlement turned his own low-wattage glare on the staff seated in the mood smoke haze around the table. No glance met his. 'That's all anybody ever does around here!' he snapped.
\par 'What?' Owling started to rise.
\par 'Busybodies!' blared Battlement. 'My whole staff!'
\par 'Ohhh.' Owling sank back into his chair. 'I meant a different kind of snooping.'
\par 'Oh, that.' Battlemont shrugged, suppressed an urge to glance up at the conference room's concealed recorder lenses. 'We cannot have our ideas pirated by other agencies, you know. Absolutely safe here.'
\par Gwen Everest chose this moment for her entrance. All eyes followed her as she came through the end door, strode down the length of the room.
\par Battlemont admired her grace. Such a feminine woman in spite of her strength. So different from the female general.
\par Gwen found a spare chair against the side wall, crowded it in between Battlemont and Finnister.
\par The commander of the WOMS glared at the intruder. 'Who are }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 you?'}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par Battlemont leaned forward. 'This is Miss E
verest, our ... ah ... ' He hesitated, confused, Gwen had never had an official title with the agency. Never needed it. Everyone in the place knew she was the boss. 'Ahh ... Miss Everest is our ... ah ... director of coordination,' said Battlemont.
\par 'Why! That's a wonderful title!' said Gwen. 'I must get it printed on my stationery.' She patted Battlement's hand, faced him and, in her best undercover-agent-going-into-action voice, said: 'Let's have it, Chief. Who are these people? What's going on?'

\par General Owling nodded to Gwen. 'I'm Owling, General, Space Engineers.' He gestured to the rocket splash insignia on his shoulder. 'My companion is General Finnister, WOMS.'
\par Gwen had recognized the famous Finnister face. She smiled brightly, said: 'General Woms!'
\par 'Finnister!' snapped the female general.
\par 'Yes, of course,' said Gwen. 'General Finnister Woms. Must not go too informal, you know.'
\par Finnister spoke in slow cadence: 'I ... am ... General ... Sonnet ... Finnister ... of ... the ... Women ... of ... Space! The WOMS!'
\par 'Oh, how stupid of me,' said Gwen. 'Of course you are.' She patted the general's hand, smiled at Battlemont.
\par Battlemont, who well knew the falsity of this mood in Gwen Everest, was trying to scrunch down out of sight in his chair.
\par In that moment, G
wen realized with a twinge of fear that she had reached a psychic point of no return. Something slipped a cog in her mind. She glanced around the table. Familiar faces leaped at her with unreal clarity. Staring eyes. (The best part of a conference was to 
watch Gwen in action.) }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 I can't take any more of this, }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 thought Gwen. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 I have to declare myself.}{
\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par She focused on the military. The rest of the people in this room owned little pieces of her, but not these two. Owling and Finnister. Space generals. Symbols. Targets!
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Let the chips fall where they may! Fire when ready, Gridley. Shoot if you must this old gray head ... Wait until you see the whites of their eyes.}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par Gwen nodded to herself.
\par One misstep and the agency was ruined.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Who cares?}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par It all passed in a split second, but the decision was made.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Rebellion!}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par 
\par Gwen turned her attention on Owling. 'Would you be kind enough to end this stalling around and get the meeting under way?'
\par 'Stall ... ' Owling broke it off. The intelligence report had said Gwen Everest was fond of shock tactics. He gave her a curt nod, passed the nod to Finnister.
\par The female general addressed Battlemont. 'Your agency, as we explained to you earlier, has been chosen for a vital task, Mr Battlefield.'
\par 'Battlemont,' said Gwen.
\par Finnister stopped short. 'What?'
\par 'His name is Battlemont, not Battlefield,' said Gwen.
\par 'What of it?'
\par 'Names are important,' said Gwen. I'm sure you appreciate this.'
\par The Finnister cheeks flushed. 'Quite!'
\par Owing stepped into the breach. 'We are authorized to pay this agency double the usual fee for performance,' he said. 'However, if you fail us we'll draft every male employee here into the Space service
\par 'What an asinine idea!' said Gwen. 'Our people would destroy the Space Service. From within.' Again she smiled at Battlemont.
\par 'Andre here could do it all by himself. Couldn't you, ducky?' She patted Battlemont's cheek.
\par Battlemont tried to crouch farther down into the chair. He avoided the eyes of the space brass, said : 'Gwen ... please.'
\par 'What do you mean, destroy the Space Service?' demanded Finnister.
\par Gwen ignored her, addressed Owling. 'This is another one of the Psych Branch's brainstorms,' she said. 'I can smell the stench of 'em in every word.'
\par Owling frowned. As a matter of fact, he had the practical builder's suspicion of everything subjective. This Everest woman made a good point there. But the military had to stand shoulder to shoulder against outsiders. He said: 'I don't believe you 
are properly equipped to fathom military tactics. Let's get on to the problem we ... '
\par 'Military tactics yet!' Gwen rapped the table. 'Deploy your forces, men. This is it! Synchronize your watches. Over the top!'
\par 'Gwen!' said Battlemont.
\par 'Of course,' said Gwen. She faced Finnister. 'Would you mind awfully outlining your problem in simple terms that our un-militarized minds could understand?'
\par A pause, a glare. Finnister spewed her words through stiff lips. 'Enlistments in the WOMS have fallen to an alarming degree. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 You }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 are going to correct this.'
\par Behind Gwen, Battlemont nodded vigorously.
\par 'Women can release men for the more strenuous tasks,' said Owling.
\par 'And there are many things women can do that men cannot do,' said Finnister.
\par 'Absolutely essential,' said Owling.
\par 'Absolutely,' agreed Finnister.
\par 'Can't draft women, I suppose,' said Gwen.
\par 'Tried to get a bill through,' said Owling. 'Damned committee's headed by an anti-military woman.'
\par 'Good for her,' said Gwen.
\par 'You do }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 not }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 sound like the person for this job,' said Owling. 'Perhaps ... '
\par 'Oh, simmer down,' said Gwen.
\par 'Miss Everest is the best in the business,' said Battlemont.
\par Gwen said: 'Why are enlistments down? You've run the usual surveys, I suppose.'
\par 'It's the space armor,' said Finnister. 'Women don't like it.'
\par Too mechanical,' said Owling. Too practical.'
\par 'We need ... ah ... glamor,' said Finnister. She adjusted the brim of her cap.
\par Gwen frowned at the cap, cast a glance up and down the Finnister uniform. 'I've seen the usual news pictures of the armor,' she said. 'What do they wear underneath it? Something like your uniform?'
\par Finnister suppressed a surge of anger. 'No. They wear special fatigues.'
\par 'The armor cannot be removed while they are in space,' said Owling.
\par 'Oh?' said Gwen. 'What about physical functions, that sort of thing?'
\par 'Armor takes care of everything,' said Owling.
\par 'Apparently not }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 quite }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 everything,' murmured Gwen. She nodded to herself, mulling tactics.
\par 
\par Battlemont straightened, sniffed the atmosphere of the conf
erence room. Staff all alert, quiet, attentive. Mood had lightened somewhat. Gwen appeared to be taking over. Good old Gwen. Wonderful Gwen. No telling what she was up to. As usual. She'd solve this thing, though. Always did. Unless ...
\par He blinked. Could s
he be toying with them? He tried to imagine Gwen's thought patterns. Impossible. IBMausoleum couldn't even do it. Unpredictable. All Battlemont could be certain of was that Gwen would get a gigantic belly laugh from the picture of the agency's male staff 
members drafted, slaving away on space freighters.
\par Battlemont trembled.
\par General Finnister was saying: "The problem is not one of getting women to enlist for Earth-based service. We need them in the ships, the asteroid stations, the ... '
\par 'Let's get this straight,' said Gwen. 'My great-great-grandmother was in some kind of armed service. I read her diary once. She called it the "whackies" or something like that.'
\par 'WACS,' said Finnister.
\par 'Yes,' said Gwen. 'It was during the war with Spain.'
\par 'Japan,' said Owling.
\par 'What I'm driving at is, why all the sudden interest in women? My great-great-grand-mother had one merry old time running away from some colonel who wanted ... Well, you know. Is this some kind of a dodge to provide women for your space colonels?'
\par Finnister scowled her blackest.
\par Quickly suppressed chuckles sounded around the table.
\par Owling decided to try a new tack. 'My dear lady, our motives are of the highest. We need the abilities of women so that mankind can march side by side to the stars.'
\par Gwen stared at him in open admiration. 'Go-wan!' she said.
\par 'I mean it,' said Owling.
\par 'You're a poet!' said Gwen. 'Oh ... and I've wronged you. Here I was - dirty-minded me - thinking you wanted women for base purposes. And all the time you wanted }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 companions. }{
\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Someone to share this glorious new adventure.'
\par Again, Battlemont recognized the danger signals. He tried to squeeze himself into as small a target as possible. Most of the staff around the table saw the same signals, but they were intent, fascinated.
\par 'Exactly!' boomed Finnister.
\par Gwen's voice erupted in an angry snarl: 'And we name all the little bastards after the stars in Virgo, ehhh?'
\par It took a long moment for Finnister and Owling to see that they had been gulled. Finnister started to rise.
\par 'Siddown!' barked Gwen. She grinned. She was having a magnificent time. Rebellion carried a sense of euphoria.
\par Owling opened his mouth, closed it without a howl.
\par Finnister sank back into her chair.
\par 'Shall we get down to business?' snapped Gwen. 'Let's look at this glorified hunk of tin you want us to glamorize.'
\par Finnister found something she could focus her shocked attention on. 'Space armor is mostly plastic, not tin.'
\par 'Plastic-schmastic,' said Gwen. 'I want to see your Iron Gertie.'
\par General Owling took two
 deep breaths to calm his nerves, snapped open the briefcase, extracted a folder of design sketches. He pushed them toward Gwen - a hesitant motion as though he feared she might take his hand with them. He now recognized that the incredible intelligence r
eport was correct: this astonishing female was the actual head of the agency.
\par 'Here's - Iron Gertie,' he said, and forced a chuckle.
\par Gwen leafed through the folder while the others watched.
\par Battlemont stared at her. He realized something the rest of the staff did not: Gwen Everest was not being the usual Gwen Everest. There was a subtle difference. An abandon. Something was }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 very }{
\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 wrong!
\par 
\par Without looking up from the drawings, Gwen addressed herself to Finnister. 'That uniform you're wearing, General Finnister. You design that yourself?'
\par 'What? Oh, yes. I did.'
\par Battlemont trembled.
\par Gwen reached out, rapped one of Finnister's hips. 'Bony,' she said. She turned a page in the folder, shook her head.
\par 'Well!' exploded Finnister.
\par Still without looking up, Gwen said: 'Simmer down. How about the hat? You design that, too?'
\par 'Yesss!' It was a sibilant explosion.
\par Gwen lifted her attention to the hat, spoke in a reasonable tone: 'Possibly the most hideous thing I've ever seen.'
\par 'Well of all the-'
\par 'Are you a fashion designer?' asked Gwen politely.
\par Finnister shook her head as though to clear it of cobwebs.
\par 'You are }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 not }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 a fashion designer?' pressed Gwen.
\par Finnister bit the words off. 'I have had }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 some }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 experience in choosing -'
\par 'The answer is no, then,' said Gwen. 'Thought so.' She brought her attention back to the folder, turned a page.
\par Finnister glared at her in open-mouthed rage.
\par Gwen glanced up at Owling. 'Why'd you put the finger on this agency?'
\par Owling appeared to have trouble focusing his attention on Owen's question. Presently, he said: 'You were ... it was pointed out that this agency was one of the most successful in ... if not the most successful ... '
\par 'We were classified as experts, eh?'
\par 'Yes. If you want to put it that way.'
\par 'I want to put it that way.' She glanced at Finnister. 'So we let the experts do the designing, is that clear? You people keep your greasy fingers off. Understood?' She shot a hard stare at Owling, back to Finnister.
\par 'I don't know about you!' Finnister snapped at Owling, 'but I've had all-'
\par 'If you value your military career you'll just sit down and listen,' said Gwen. Again, she glared at Owling. 'Do you understand?'
\par Owling shook his head from side to side. Amazement dominated him. Abruptly, he realized that his h
ead shaking could be interpreted as negative. He bobbed his head up and down, decided in mid-motion that this was undignified. He stopped, cleared his throat.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 What an astonishing female! }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 he thought.
\par Gwen pushed the folder of design sketches uptable to Leo Prim, the art director. 'Tell me, General Owling,' she said, 'why is the armor so bulky?'
\par Leo Prim, who had opened the folder, began to chuckle.
\par 'Marvelous, isn't it?' said Gwen.
\par Someone farther uptable asked: 'What is?'
\par Gwen kept her attention on Owling. 'Some jassack engineer in the Space Service designed a test model suit of armor like a gigantic woman - breasts and all.' She glanced at Finnister. 'You ran a survey on the stupid thing, of course?'
\par Finnister nodded. She was shocked speechless.
\par 'I could've saved you the trouble,' said Gwen. 'One of the reasons you'd better listen carefully to what }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 expert me }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
has to say. No woman in her right mind would get into that thing. She'd feel big - and she'd feel naked.' Gwen shook her head. 'Freud! What a combination!'
\par Owling wet his lips with his tongue. 'Ah, the armor has to provide sufficient shielding against radiation, and it must remain articulate under extremes of pressure and temperature,' he said. 'It can't be made any smal
ler and still permit a human being to fit into it.
\par 'Okay,' said Gwen. 'I have the beginnings of an idea.'
\par She closed her eyes, thought: }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 These military jerks are a couple of sitting ducks. Almost a shame to pot them. }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 She opened her eyes, glanced at Battlemo
nt. His eyes were closed. He appeared to be praying. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Could be the ruination of poor Andre and his lovely people, too, }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 she thought. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
What a marvelous collection of professional stranglers! Well, can't be helped. When Gwen Everest goes out, she goes out in a blaze of glory! All flags flying! Full speed ahead! Damn the torpedoes!}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par 'Well?' said Owling.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Fire one! }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 thought Gwen. She said: 'Presumably, you have specialists, experts who can advise us on technical details.'
\par 'At your beck and call whenever you say the word,' said Owling.
\par Battlemont opened his eyes, stared at the back of Owen's neck. A ray of hope stabbed through his panic. Was it possible that Gwen was really taking over?
\par 'I'll also want all the dope on which psychological types make the best WOMS,' said Gwen. 'If there is such a thing as a best WOM.'
\par Battlemont closed his eyes, shuddered.
\par 'I don't believe I've ever been treated this high-handedly in my entire career!' blurted Finnister. 'I'm not entirely sure that -'
\par 'Just a moment, please,' said Owling. He studied Gwen, who was smiling at him. The intelligence report said this woman was 'probable genius' and should be handled delicately.
\par 'I'm only sorry the law doesn't give us the right to draft women, too!' barked Finnister.
\par 'Then you wouldn't really have this problem, would you?' asked Gwen. She turned her smile on Finnister. It was full of beatitudes.
\par Owling said: 'I know we have full authority to handle this at our own discretion, General Finnister, and I agree that we've been subjected to some abuse but ... '
\par 'Abuse!' Finnister said.
\par 'And high time, too,' said Gwen.
\par A violent shudder passed through Battlemont. He thought: }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 We are doomed!}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par 'However,' said Owling, 'we mustn't let our personal feelings cloud a decision for the good of the service.'
\par 'I hear the bugles blowing," murmured Gwen.
\par 'This agency }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 was }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 chosen as the one most likely to solve the problem,' said Owling.
\par 'There }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 could }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 have been a mistake!' said Finnister.
\par 'Not likely.'
\par 'You are determined to turn this thing over to ... to ... " Finnister broke off, tapped her palms on the table top.
\par 'It's advisable,' said Owling. He thought: }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 This Gwen Everest will solve our problem. No problem could resist her. No problem would dare!}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par General Owling had become a Gwenophile.
\par 'Very well, then,' snarled Finnister. 'I will reserve my judgment.'
\par General Finnister had become a Gwenophobe.
\par Which was part of Gwen Everest's program.
\par 'I presume you two will be available for technical consultations from time to time,' said Gwen.
\par 'Our subordinates take care of details,' said Owling. 'All General Finnister and I are interested in is the big picture, the key to the puzzle.'
\par 'Big picture, key to puzzle,' mused Gwen. 'Wonderful idea.'
\par 'What?' Owling stared at her, puzzled.
\par 'Nothing,' said Gwen. 'Just thinking out loud.'
\par Owling stood up, looked at Finnister. 'Shall we be going?"
\par Finnister also stood up, turned toward the door at the end of the room. 'Yesss!'
\par Together, one on each side of the table, they inarched the length of the room: tump-a-thump-a-tump-a-thump-a-tump ... Just as they reached the door and Owling opened it, Gwen jumped to her feet. 'Charrrge!' she shouted.
\par The two officers froze, almost turned, thought better of it. They left, slamming the door.
\par Battlemont spoke plaintively into the silence. 'Gwen, why do you destroy us?
\par 'Destroy you? Don't be silly!'
\par 'But, Gwen ... '
\par 'Please be quiet, Andre; you're interrupting my train of thought.' She turned to Leo Prim. 'Leo, take those sketches and things of that big-breasted Bertha they designed. I want adecal workups on them, full projos, the entire campaign outlay.'
\par 'Big Bertha adecals, projos, the outlay,' said Prim. 'Right!'
\par 'Gwen, what are you doing?' asked Battlemont. 'You said yourself that -'
\par 'You're babbling, Andre,' said Gwen. She glanced up at the ceiling. An eye in one of the Cellini cupids winked at her. 'We got the usual solid recordings of this conference, I presume?'
\par 'Of course,' said Battlemont.
\par 'Take those recordings, Leo,' said Gwen. 'Do a sequence out of them featuring only General Sinister Sonnet Bonnet Finnister.'
\par 'What'd you call her?' asked Prim.
\par 
\par Gwen explained about the Finnister nicknames. 'The fashion trade knows all about her,' she finished. 'A living horror.'
\par 'Yeah, okay,' said Prim. 'A solid sequence of nothing but Finnister. What do you want it to show?'
\par 'Every angle of that uniform,' said Gwen. 'And the hat, Freud! Don't forget that hat!'
\par Battlemont spoke plaintively. 'I don't understand.'
\par 'Good,' said Gwen. 'Leo, send me Restivo and Jim Spark ... a couple more of your best design people. Include yourself. We'll ... '
\par 'And, lo! Ben Adam's name led all the rest,' said Battlemont,
\par Gwen turned, stared down at him. For one of the rare times in their association, Battlemont had surprised her with something he said.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 I wonder if our dear Andre could be human? }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 she mused. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 No! I must be going soft in the head. }{
\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 She said: 'Andre, go take a meditation break until time to call our next conference. Eh? There's a good fellow.'
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Always before when she abused me it was like a joke between us, }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 thought Battlemont dolefully. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 But now she is trying to hurt. }{
\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 His concern now was for Gwen, not for the agency. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 My Gwen needs help. And I don't know what to do.}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par 'Meditation break time,' said Gwen. 'Or you could go to a mood bar. Why don't you try the new Interdorma mediniche? A niche in time saves the mind!'
\par 'I prefer to remain awake for our last hours together,' said Battlemont. A sob clutched at his throat. He stood up to cover the moment, d
rew himself to attention, fixed Gwen with a despairing glare. 'I feel the future crouching over us like a great beast!' He turned his back on her, strode out through his private door.
\par 'I wonder what the devil he meant by that?' mused Gwen.
\par Prim said: 'This is the month of St Freud. They go for prescience, extrasensory perception, that sort of thing.'
\par 'Oh, certainly,' she said. 'I wrote the brochure.' But she found herself disturbed by Battlemont's departure. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 He looked so pitiful, }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 she thought. }{
\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 What if this little caper backfires and he gets drafted? It could happen. Leo and the rest of these stranglers could take it. But Andre ... }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 She gave a mental shrug. }{
\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Too late to turn back now.}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par Department heads began pressing toward Gwen along the table. 'Say, Gwen, what about the production on ...' 'If I'm going to meet any deadlines I'll need more ... ' 'Will we have to drop our other ... '
\par 'Shaddup!' bellowed Gwen.
\par She smiled sweetly into the shocked silence. 'I will meet with each of you privately, just as soon as I get in a fresh stock of crying towels. First things first, though. Number one problem: we get the monkey off our backs. Eh?'
\par And she thought: }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 You poor oafs! You aren't even aware how close you are to disaster. You think Gwen is taking over as usual. But Gwen
 doesn't care. Gwen doesn't give a damn any more. Gwen is resigning in a blaze of glory! Into the valley of death rode the 600! Or was it 400? No matter. War is hell! I only regret that I have but one life to give for my agency. Give me liberty or give me
 to the WOMS.}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par Leo Prim said: 'You're going for the throat on these two military types, is that it?'
\par 'Military tactics,' said Gwen. 'No survivors! Take no prisoners! Death to the White Eyes!'
\par 'Huh?' said Prim.
\par 'Get right on that assignment I gave you,' she said.
\par 'Uhh ... ' Prim looked down at the folder Owling had left. 'Workups on this Big Bertha thing ... a solido on Finnister. Okay.' He shook his head. 'You know, this business could shape up into a Complete Flap.'
\par 'It could be worse than that,' Gwen cautioned.
\par Someone else said: 'It's absolutely the worst I've ever seen. Drafted!'
\par And Gwen thought: }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Ooooh! Someone" has trepidations I }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Abruptly, she said: 'Absolutely worst flap.' She brightened. "That's wonderful! One moment, all you lovely people.'

\par There was sudden stillness in the preparations for departure.
\par 'It has been moved that we label this business the Absolutely Worst Flap,' she said.
\par Chuckles from the staff.
\par 'You will note,' said Gwen, 'that the initials A-W-F are the first three letters in the word }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 awful.'}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par Laughter.
\par 'Up to now,' said Gwen, 'we've only had to content with Minor, Medium and Complete Flaps. Now I give you the AWF! It rhymes with the grunt of someone being slugged in the stomach!'
\par Into the laughter that filled the room, Prim said: 'How about the U and L in awful? Can't let them go to waste.'
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 '}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Un}{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 limitedl' }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
snapped Gwen. 'Absolutely Worst Flap Unlimited!' She began to laugh, had to choke it off as the laughter edged into hysteria. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 What in hell's wrong with me? }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
she wondered. She glared at Prim. 'Let's get cracking, men! Isn't a damn one of you would look good in uniform.'
\par The laughter shaded down into nervous gutterings. 'That Gwen!'
\par Gwen had to get out of there. It was like a feeling of nausea. She pushed her way down the side of the
 room. The sparkle had gone out of her rebellion. She felt that all of these people were pulling at her, taking bits of herself that she could never recapture. It made her angry. She wanted to kick, bite, claw. Instead, she smiled fixedly. 'Excuse me. May
 I get through here? Sorry. Thank you. Excuse me.'
\par And an image of Andre Battlemont kept intruding on her consciousness. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Such a pitiful little fellow. So ... well ... sweet-Dam-mit! Sweet! In a despicable sort of way.}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par 
\par Twenty-five days slipped off the calen
dar. Twenty-five days of splashing in a pool of confusion. Gwen's element. She hurled herself into the problem. This one had to be just right. A tagline for her exit. A Gwen Everest signature at the bottom of the page.
\par Technical experts from the military s
warmed all through the agency. Experts on suit articulation. Experts on shielding. Pressure coefficients. Artificial atmosphere. Waste reclamation. Sub-miniature power elements. A locksmith. An expert on the new mutable plastics. }{
\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 (He }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 had to be flown in from the West Coast.)
\par Plus the fashion experts seen only by Gwen.
\par It was quite a job making sure that each military expert saw only what his small technical world required.
\par Came the day of the Big Picture. The very morning.
\par Adjacent to her office Gwen maintai
ned a special room about 20 feet square. She called it 'my intimidation room.' It was almost Louis XV: insubstantial chairs, teetery little tables, glass gimcracks on the light fixtures, pastel cherubs on the wall panels.
\par The chairs looked as though they m
ight smash flat under the weight of a medium-sized man. Each (with the exception of a padded throne chair that slid from behind a wall panel for Gwen) had a seat that canted forward. The sitters kept sliding off, gently, imperceptibly.
\par None of the tables had a top large enough for a note pad }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 and }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
an ashtray. One of these items had to be balanced in the lap or placed underfoot. That forced an occasional look at the carpet.
\par The carpet had been produced with alarming psychological triggers. The uninitiated felt that they were standing upside down in a fishbowl.
\par General Owling occupied one of the trick chairs. He tried to keep from staring at the cherub centered in a wall panel directly across from him, slightly to the right of the seated figure of Andre Battlemo
nt. Battlement looked ill. Owling pushed himself backward in the chair. His knees felt exposed. He glanced at General Finnister. She sat to his right beyond a spindly table. She pulled her skirt down as he watched. He wondered why she sat so far forward o
n the chair.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Damned uncomfortable little chairs!}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par He noted that Battlemont had brought in one of the big conference room chairs for himself. Owling wondered why they all couldn't have those big, square, solid, secure chairs. For that matter, why wasn't this 
meeting being held in the big conference room? Full staff. The Big Picture! He glanced up at the wall panel opposite. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Stupid damned cherub! }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
He looked down at the rug, grimaced, tore his gaze away.
\par Finnister had looked at the rug when she came into the room
, had almost lost her balance. Now, she tried to keep her attention off it. Her mind seethed with disquieting rumors. Individual reports from the technical experts failed to reveal a total image. It was like a jigsaw puzzle with pieces from separate puzzl
es all thrown together. She pushed herself backward in the chair. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 What an uncomfortable room. }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
Intuition told her the place was subtly deliberate. Her latent anger at Gwen Everest flared. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Where is that woman?}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par Battlemont cleared his throat, glanced at the door to his right through which Gwen was expected momentarily. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Must she always be late? }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
Gwen had avoided him for weeks. Too busy. Suddenly this morning she had to have Andre Battlemont front and center. A figurehead. A prop for her little show. He knew pretty
 much what she was doing, too. In the outward, physical sense. She might be able to keep things from some of the people around here, but Andre Battlemont ran his own intelligence system. As to what was going on in her mind, though, he couldn't be sure. Al
l he knew was that it didn't fit. Not even for Gwen.
\par Finnister said: 'Our technical people inform us that you've been pretty interested -' she pushed herself back in the chair - 'in the characteristics of some of the newer mutable plastics.'
\par 'That is true,' said Battlemont.
\par 'Why?' asked Owling.
\par 'Ahhh, perhaps we'd better wait for Miss Everest,' said Battlemont. 'She is bringing a solido projector.'
\par 'You have mockups already?' asked Owling.
\par 'Yes.'
\par 'Good! How many models?'
\par 'One. Our receptionist. Beautiful girl.'
\par 'What?' Finnister and Owling in unison.
\par 'Oh! You mean ... that is, we have the one to show you. It is really two ... but only one of ... ' He shrugged, suppressed a shudder.
\par Finnister and Owling looked at each other.
\par 
\par Battlemont closed his eyes. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Gwen, please hurry. }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
He thought about her solution to the military problem, began to tremble. Her basic idea was sound, of course. Good psychological roots. But the military would never go for it. Especially that female general who walked like a se
rgeant. Battlemont's eyes snapped open as he heard a door open.
\par Gwen came in pushing a portable display projector. A glance of mutual dislike passed between Gwen and Finnister, was masked by mutual bright smiles immediately.
\par 'Good morning, everybody,' chirped Gwen.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Danger signal! }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 thought Battlemont. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 She's mad! She's }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
... He stopped the thought, focused on it. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Maybe she is. We work her so hard.}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par 'Anxious to see what you have there,' said Owling. 'Just getting ready to ask for a progress report when you called this meeting.'
\par 'We wanted to have something first that you could appreciate as an engineer,' said Gwen.
\par Owling nodded.
\par Finnister said: 'Our people report that you've been very secretive about your work. Why?'
\par 'The very walls have ears. Loose lips lose the 
Peace! Don't be half safe!' Gwen positioned the projector in the center of the room, took the remote control, crossed to a panel which swung out to disgorge her chair. She sat down facing Finnister and Owling.
\par Seconds dragged past while she stared in fascination at Finnister's knees.
\par 'Gwen?' said Battlemont.
\par Finnister tugged down on the hem of her skirt.
\par 'What do you have to show us?' demanded Owling. He pushed himself back in the chair.
\par 'First,' said Gwen, 'let us examine the perimeters of the problem. You must ask yourself: What do young women want when they enter the service?'
\par 'Sounds sensible,' said Owling.
\par Finnister nodded, her dislike of Gwen submerged in attention to the words.
\par They want several things,' said Gwen. 'They want travel ... adventure ... the knight errant sort of thing. Tally-ho!'
\par Battlement, Finnister and Owling snapped to shocked attention.
\par 'Gives you pause when you think about it,' murmured Gwen. 'All those women looking for something. Looking for the free ride. The brass ring. The pot at the end of the rainbow.'
\par She had them nodding again, Gwen noted. She raised her voice: The old carousel! The jingle-dingle joy journey!'
\par Battlement looked at her sadly. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Mad. Ohhh, my poor, poor Gwenny.}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par Owling said: 'I ... uh ... '
\par 'But they all want one commodity!' snapped Gwen. 'And what's that? Romance! That's what's that. And in the unconscious mind what's that romance? That romance is sex!'
\par 'I believe I've heard enough,' said Finnister.
\par 'No,' said Owling. 'Let's uh ... this is all, I'm sure, preliminary. I want to know where ... after all, the model ... models they've developed ... '
\par 'What's with sex when you get all the folderol off it?' demanded Gwen. 'The psychological roots. What's down there?'
\par Owling scratched his throat, stared at her. He had a basic distrust of subjective ideas, but he always came smack up against the fear that maybe (just maybe now) they were correct. Some of them appeared (and it could be appearance }{
\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 only) }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 to work.
\par 'I'll tell you what's down there,' muttered Gwen. 'Motherhood. Home. Security with a man. The flag.'
\par Owling thought: }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 It all sounds so sensible ... except.,}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 .
\par 'And what does your armor do?' asked Gwen. 'Armor equals no amour! They're locked up in desexed chunks of metal and plastic where no men can get at them. Great Freud! Men can't even see them in there!'
\par 'Women don't really }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 want }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 men to get at them!' barked Finnister. 'Of all the disgusting ideas I've ever -'
\par 'Just a minute!' said Gwen. 'A }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 normal }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 woman always wants the }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 possibility. }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
That's what she wants. And she wants it under }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 her }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 control. You've eliminated the possibility. You've taken all control out of thei
r hands, put your women at the mercy of the elements, separated from cold, masculine, angular ABRUPT AND FINAL DEATH! by only a thin layer of plastic and metal.'
\par Battlemont stared at her helplessly. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Poor Gwen. Doomed. And she won't even sell this idea. We're all doomed with her.}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par 
\par Finnister glared at Gwen, still smarting under the implied dig of the word }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 normal.}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par 'How do you propose to get around these, ah, objections?' asked Owling.
\par 'You'll see,' said Gwen. 'Let's go in from the perimeter now. Remember, the 
basic female idea is to be able to run away with the assurance that she will be caught. She wants a certain amount of exposure as a female without being too bare-ahhh-faced about it.'
\par 'Mmmmph!' said Finnister.
\par Gwen smiled at her.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Gwen is deliberately destroying herself and us with her, }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 thought Battlemont.
\par 'Do you see what is lacking?' asked Gwen.
\par 'Hninimm-ahhhhh-hmmmmm,' said Owling.
\par 'A universal symbol,' said Gwen. 'A bold symbol. A symbol!'
\par 'What do you propose?' asked Owling.
\par That's it!' said Gwen. 'A proposal! Plus -' she hesitated - 'the symbol! The key is very simple.' She sat up, perky, grinning at them. 'In fact, it's a key!'
\par Finnister and Owling spoke in unison: 'A key?'
\par 'Yes. Two keys, actually. Symbolism's obvious.' She produced two keys from her jacket pocket, held them up. 'As you can see, one key is hard, angular ... a masculine key. The other has fancy curves. It's daintier, more the ... '
\par 'Do you mean to tell me,' howled Owling, 'that you people have spent all these weeks, all those consultations with our experts, and come up with ... with ... with ... ' He pointed, unable to continue.
\par Gwen shook her head from side to side. 'Oh, no. Remember, these are just symbols. They're important, of course. One might even say they were vital. Each key will be inscribed with the name of the person who gets it.'
\par 'What are they keys to?' asked Finnister. She was fascinated in spite of herself.
\par To the space armor, naturally,' said Gwen. 'These keys lock your people in their armor - both men }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 and }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 women.'
\par 'Lock them?' protested Finnister. 'But you said ... '
\par 'I know,' said Gwen. 'But, you see, a key that will lock people into something will also let them out. As a matter of fact, any one of these keys will open any suit. That's for the safety factor.'
\par 'But they can't get }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 out }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 of their suits when they're in space!' howled Owling. 'Of all the ... '
\par That's right!' said Gwen. They can't }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 really }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 get out. So we give them the }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 symbol }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
of getting out. For exchanging.'
\par 'Exchanging?' asked Finnister.
\par 'Certainly. A male astronaut sees a girl astronaut he likes. He asks net to trade keys. Very romantic. Symbolic of things that }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 may }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
happen when they return to Earth or get to a base where they can get out of the suits.'
\par 'Miss Everest,' said Finnister, 'as you so aptly pointed out earlier, no astronaut can see one of our women in this armor. And even if he could, I don't believe that I'd ... '
\par She froze, staring, shocked speechless.
\par Owen had pushed a stud on the solido projector's remote control. A suit of spa
ce armor appeared to be hanging in the center of the room. In the suit, wearing a form-fitting jacket, stood the agency's busty receptionist. The suit of armor around her was transparent from the waist up.
\par The bottom half remains opaque at all times,' said Gwen. 'For reasons of modesty ... the connections. However, the top half ... '
\par Gwen pushed another stud. The transparent upper half faded through gray to black until it concealed the model.
\par 'For privacy when desired,' said Gwen. 'That's how we've used the new mutable plastic. Gives the girl some control over her environment.'
\par Again, Gwen pushed the first stud. The upper half of the model reappeared.
\par Finnister gaped at the form-fitting uniform.
\par Gwen stood up, took a pointer, gestured in through the projecti
on. 'This uniform was designed by a leading couturier. It is made to reveal while concealing. A woman with only a fair figure will appear to good advantage in it. A woman with an excellent figure appears stunning, as you can see. Poor figures -' Gwen shru
gged -'there }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 are }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 exercises for developing them. Or so I am told.'
\par Finnister interrupted in a cold voice. 'And what do you propose to do with that ... that uni ... clothing?'
\par This will be the regulation uniform for the WOMS,' said Gwen. There's a cute little hat goes with it. Very sexy.'
\par Battlemont said: 'Perhaps the changeover could be made slowly so as to ... '
\par 'What changeover?' demanded Finnister. She leaped to her feet. 'General Owling?'
\par Battlemont thought: }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 I knew it. Oh, my poor Gwenny! They will destroy her, too. I knew it.}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par 'We can't waste any more time with this agency,' said Finnister. 'Come, General.'
\par 'Wait!' yelped Battlemont. He leaped to his feet. 'Gwen, I told you ... '
\par Finnister said: 'It's regrettable, but ... '
\par 'Perhaps we're being a little hasty,' said Owling. There may be something to salvage from this ... '
\par 'Yes!' said Battlemont. 'Just a little more time is all we need to get a fresh ... '
\par 'I think not,' said Finnister.
\par 
\par Gwen smiled from one to the other, thought: }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 What a prize lot of gooney birds! }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 She felt a little drunk, as euphoric as if she had just come from a mood bar. }{
\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Rebellion, it's wonderful! Up the Irish! Or something.}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par Owling shrugged, thought: }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 We have to stand together against}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752  }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 civilians. General Finnister is right. Too bad, though. }{
\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 He got to his feet.
\par 'Just a little more time,' pleaded Battlemont.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 Too bad about Andre, }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 thought Gwen. She had an inspiration, said: 'One moment, please.'
\par Three pairs of eyes focused on her.
\par Finnister said: 'If you think you can stop me from going through with our threat, dissuade yourself. I'm perfectly aware that you had that uni ... that }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 clothing }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
designed to make }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 me }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 look hideous!'
\par 'Why not?' asked Gwen. 'I was only doing to you what you did to virtually every other woman in the WOMS.'
\par 'Gwen!' pleaded Battlemont in horror.
\par 'Be still, Andre,' said Gwen. 'It's just a matter of timing, anyway. Today. Tomorrow. Next week. Not really important.'
\par 'Oh, my poor Gwenny,' sobbed Battlemont.
\par 'I was going to wait,' said Gwen. 'Possibly a week. At least until I'd turned in my resignation.'
\par 'What're you talking about?' asked Owling.
\par 'Resignation!' gasped Battlemont.
\par 'I just can't toss poor Andre here to the wolves,' said Gwen. 'The rest of our men, yes. Once they get inside they'll chew your guts out, anyway.'
\par 'What }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 are }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 you talking about?' asked Finnister.
\par The rest of the men in this agency can take care of themselves ... and you, too,' said Gwen. 'Wolves among wolves. But Andre here is helpless. All he has is his pos
ition ... money. He's an accident. Put him someplace where money and position are less important, it'll kill him.'
\par 'Regrettable,' said Finnister. 'Shall we be going, General Owling?'
\par 'I was going to ruin both of you,' said Gwen. 'But I'll tell you what. You leave Andre alone and I'll just give }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 one }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 of you the business.'
\par 'Gwen, what are you saying?' whispered Battlemont.
\par 'Yesss!' hissed Finnister. 'Explain yourself!'
\par 'I just want to know the pecking order here,' said Gwen. 'Which one of you ranks the other?'
\par 'What does that have to do with it?' asked Finnister.
\par 'Just a minute,' said Owling. That intelligence report.' He glared at Gwen. 'I'm told you've prepared an adecal on the test model we made before coming to you.'
\par 'Big Bertha,' said Gwen. 'And it's not just an adecal. I have everything needed for a full national campaign. Look!'
\par A solido of the breast-bearing test model replaced the transparent suit hanging in the center of the room.
\par 'The idea for Big Bertha here originated with General Owling,' said Gwen.
 'My campaign establishes that fact, then goes on to feature an animated model of Big Bertha. She is a living panic. Funniest thing you ever saw. General Owling, you will be the laughing stock of the nation by nightfall of the day I start this campaign.'

\par Owling took a step forward.
\par Battlemont said: 'Gwen! They will destroy you!'
\par Owling pointed at the projection. 'You ... you wouldn't!'
\par 'But I would,' said Gwen. She smiled at him.
\par Battlemont tugged at Owen's arm. She shook him off.
\par 'It would ruin me,' whispered Owling.
\par 'Presumably, you are capable of going through with this threat,' said Finnister. 'Regrettable.'
\par Owling whirled on Finnister. 'We must stand together!' he said desperately.
\par 'You bet,' said Gwen. She pushed another stud on the remote control.
\par A projection of General Finnister in her famous uniform replaced Big Bertha.
\par 'You may as well know the whole story,' said Gwen. 'I'm all set with another campaign on the designing of this uniform, right from the Sonnet Bonnet on down through the Sinister Finn
ister cape and those sneaky walking shoes. I start with a dummy model of the general clad in basic foundation garments. Then I go on to show how each element of the present WOMS uniform was designed for the ... ah ... Finnister ... ah ... figure.'
\par 'I'll sue!' barked Finnister.
\par 'Go ahead. Go ahead.' Gwen waved a sinuous arm.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 She acts drunk! }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 thought Battlemont. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 But she never drinks.}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par 'I'm all set to go black market with these campaigns,' said Gwen. 'You can't stop me. I'll prove every contention I make about that uniform. I'll expose you. I'll show why your enlistment drives flopped.'
\par 
\par Red suffused the Finnister face. 'All right!' she snapped. 'If you're going to ruin us, I guess there's nothing we can do about it. But mark this, Miss Everest
. We'll have the men of this agency in the service. You'll have that on your conscience! And the men we draft will serve under friends of ours. I hope you know what that means!'
\par 'You don't have any friends,' said Gwen, but her voice lacked conviction. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 It's backfiring, }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 she thought. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
Oh, hell. I didn't think they'd defy me.}{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
\par There may even be something we can do about you!' said Finnister. 'A presidential order putting you in the service for reasons of national emergency. Or an emergency clause on some bill. And when we get our hands on you, Miss Everest ... '
\par 'Andre!' wailed Gwen. It was all getting out of hand. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 I didn't want to hurt anybody, }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 she thought. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 I just ... }{
\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 She realized that she didn't know what she }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 had }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 wanted.
\par Battlemont was electrified. In 22 years, 
Gwen Everest had never appealed to anyone for help. And now, for the first time, her appeal was to him! He stepped between Gwen and Finnister. 'Andre is right here," he said. He felt inspired. His Gwen had appealed to him! 'You assassin!' he said, shaking
 a finger under the Finnister nose.
\par 'Now, see here!' snapped Owling. 'I won't stand for any more of-'
\par 'And you!' barked Battlemont, whirling. 'We have recordings of every conference here, from the first, and including this one! They show what happened! Don't you know what is wrong with this poor girl? You! You've driven her out of her mind!'
\par Gwen joined in the chorus: 'What?'
\par 'Be still, Gwen,' said Battlemont. 'I will handle this.'
\par Gwen couldn't take her attention off him. Battlemont was magnificent. 'Yes, Andre.'
\par 'I will prove it,' said Battlemont. 'With Interdorma psychiatrists. With all the experts money can buy. You chink you have seen something in those campaigns our Gwen set up? Hah! I will show you something.' He stabbed a finger at Owling. 'Can the mi
litary drive you insane?'
\par 'Oh, now see here,' said Owling. "This has gone -'
\par 'Yes! It }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 can }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
drive you insane!' said Battlemont. 'And we will show, step by step, how you drove our poor Gwen out of her mind with fear for her friends. Fear for me!' He slapped h
imself on the chest, glared at Finnister. 'And you know what we will do next? We will say to the public: This could happen to you! Who is next? You? Or you? Or you? Then what happens to your money from Congress? What happens to your enlistment quotas?'

\par 'Now see here,' said Owling. 'We didn't ... '
\par 'Didn't you?' snarled Battlemont. 'You think this poor girl is in her right mind?'
\par 'Well, but we didn't ... '
\par 'Wait until you see our campaign,' said Battlemont. He took Gwen's hand, patted it. 'There, there, Gwenny. Andre will fix.'
\par 'Yes, Andre,' she said. They were the only words she could find. She felt stupefied. }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 He's in love with me, }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 
she thought. Never before had she known anyone to be in love with her. Not even her parents, who had always been repelled by the
 intellect they had spawned. Gwen felt warmth seeping through her. A cog slipped into motion in her mind. It creaked somewhat from long idleness. She thought: }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 He's in love with me! }{
\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 She wanted to hug him.
\par 'We seem to be at a stalemate,' muttered Owling.
\par Finnister said: 'But we can't just -'
\par 'Shut up!' ordered Owling. 'He'll do it! Can't you see that?'
\par 'But if we draft-'
\par 'He'll do it for sure, then! Buy some other agency to run the campaign.'
\par 'But we could turn around and draft -'
\par 'You can't draft everybody who disagrees with you, woman! Not in this country! You'd start a revolution!'
\par 'I ... ' Finnister said helplessly.
\par 'And it's not just us he'd ruin,' said Owling. The whole service. He'd strike right at the money. I know his type. He wasn't bluffing. It'd be catastrophic!'
\par 
\par Owling shook his head, seeing a parade of crumbling military projects pass before his mind's eye, all falling into an abyss labeled 'NSF.'
\par 'You are an intelligent man, General Owling,' said Battlemont.
\par 'That Psych Branch!' snarled Owling. 'Them and their bright ideas!'
\par 'I told you they were fuzzy-heads,' said Gwen.
\par 'You be still, Gwen,' said Battlemont.
\par 'Yes, Andre.'
\par 'Well, what're we going to do?' demanded Owling.
\par 'I tell you what,' said Battlemont 'You leave us alone, we leave you alone.'
\par 'But what about my enlistments?' wailed Finnister.
\par 'You think our Gwen, sick or well, can't solve your problems?' asked Battlemont. 'For your enlistments you use the program as outlined.'
\par 'I won't!'
\par 'You will,' said Owling.
\par 'General Owling, I refuse to have ... '
\par 'What happens if I have to dump this problem on the General Staff?' asked Owling. 'Where will the head-chopping start? In the Psych Branch? Certainly. Who'll be next? The people who could've solved it in the field, that's who!'
\par Finnister said: 'But -'
\par 'For that matter,' said Owling, 'Miss Everest's ideas sounded pretty sensible ... with some modifications, of course.'
\par 'No modifications," said Battlemont.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 He's a veritable Napoleon! }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 thought Gwen.
\par 'Only in minor, unimportant details,' soothed Owling. 'For engineering reasons.'
\par 'Perhaps,' agreed Battlemont. 'Provided we pass on the modifications before they are made.'
\par 'I'm sure we can work it out,' said Owling.
\par Finnister gave up, turned her back on them.
\par 'One little detail,' murmured Battlemont. 'When you make out the double-fee check to the agency, make a substantial addition-bonus for Miss Everest.'
\par 'Naturally,' said Owling.
\par 'Naturally,' said Battlemont.
\par When the space brass had departed, Battlemont faced Gwen, stamped his foot. 'You have been very bad, Gwen!'
\par 'But, Andre -'
\par 'Resignation!' barked Battlemont.
\par 'But -'
\par 'Oh, I understand, Gwen. It's my fault. I worked you much too hard. But that is past.'
\par 'Andre, you don't -'
\par 'Yes, I do! I understand. You were going to sink the ship and go down with it. My poor, dear Gwen. A death wish! If you'd only paid attention to your Interdorma Telelog.'
\par 'I didn't want to hurt anyone here, Andre. Only those two -'
\par 'Yes, yes. I know. You're all mixed up.'
\par That's true.' She felt like crying. She hadn't cried ... since ... she couldn't remember when. 'You know,' she said, 'I can't remember ever crying.'
\par 'That's it!' said Battlemont. 'I cry all the time. You need a stabilizing influence. You need someone to teach you how to cry.'
\par 'Would you teach me, Andre?'
\par 'Would I ... ' He wiped the tears from his eyes. 'You are going on a vacation. Immediately! I am going with you.'
\par 'Yes, Andre.'
\par 'And when we return - '
\par 'I don't want to come back to the agency, Andre. I ... can't.'
\par 'So that's it!' said Battlemont. 'The advertising business! It bugs you!'
\par 
\par She shrugged. 'I'm ... I just can't face another campaign. I ... just ... can't.'
\par 'You will write a book,' announced Battlemont.
\par 'What?'
\par 'Best therapy known,' said Battlemont. 'Did it myse
lf once. You will write about the advertising business. You will expose all the dirty tricks: the hypno-jingles, the subvisual flicker images, the advertisers who finance textbooks to get their sell into them, the womb rooms where the }{
\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 you-seekers }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 are programmed. Everything.'
\par 'I could do it,' she said.
\par 'You will tell all,' said Battlemont.
\par 'Will I!'
\par 'And you will do it under a pseudonym,' said Battlemont. 'Safer.'
\par 'When do we start the vacation, Andre?'
\par Tomorrow.' He experienced a moment of his old panic. 'You don't mind that I'm ... ugly as a pig?'
\par 'You're just beautiful,' she said. She smoothed the hair across his bald spot. 'You don't mind that I'm smarter than you?'
\par 'Ah, hah!' Battlemont drew himself to attention. 'You may be smarter in the head, my darling, but you are }{\i\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 not }{\fs20\insrsid1794595\charrsid14107752 smarter in the heart!'

\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
\par With an increasing sense of unease, Alan Wallace studied his client as they neared the public hearing room on the second floor of the Old Senate Orace Building. The guy was too relaxed.
\par 'Bill, I'm worried about this,' Wallace said. 'You could damn well lose your grazing rights here in this room today.'
\par They were almost into the gantlet of guards, reporters and TV cameramen before Wallace got his answer.
\par 'Who the hell cares?' Custer asked.
\par Wallace, who prided himself on being the Washington-type lawyer - above contamination by complaints and briefs, immune to all shock - found himself tongue-tied with surprise.
\par They were into the ruck then and Wallace had to pull on his bold face, smiling at the press, trying to soften the sharpness of that necessary phrase:
\par 'No comment. Sorry.'
\par 'See us after the hearing if you have any questions, gentlemen,' Custer said.
\par The man's voice was level and confident.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 He has himself over-controlled, }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Wallace thought. }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Maybe he was just joking ... a graveyard joke.}{
\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
\par The marble-walled hearing room blazed with lights. Camera platforms had been raised above the seats at the rear. Some of the smaller UHF stations had their cameramen standing on the window ledges.
\par The subdued hubbub of the place eased slightly, Wallace noted, then picked up t
empo as William R. Custer - 'The Baron of Oregon' they called him - entered with his attorney, passed the press tables and crossed to the seats reserved for them in the witness section.
\par Ahead and to their right, that one empty chair at the long table stood waiting with its aura of complete exposure.
\par ' }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Who the hell cares?'}{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
\par That wasn't a Custer-type joke, Wallace reminded himself. For all his cattle-baron pose, Custer held a doctorate in agriculture and degrees in philosophy, math and electronics. His western neighbors called him 'The Brain'.
\par It was no accident that the cattlemen had chosen him to represent them here.
\par Wallace glanced covertly at the man, studying him. The cowboy boots and string tie added to a neat dark business suit would have been affectatio
n on most men. They merely accented Custer's good looks - the sun-burned, windblown outdoorsman. He was a little darker of hair and skin than his father had been, still light enough to be called blonde, but not as ruddy and without the late father's drink
-tumescent veins.
\par But then young Custer wasn't quite thirty.
\par Custer turned, met the attorney's eyes. He smiled.
\par 
\par 'Those were good patent attorneys you recommended, Al,' Custer said. He lifted his briefcase to his lap, patted it. 'No mincing around or mealy-mouthed excuses. Already got this thing on the way.' Again, he tapped the briefcase.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 He brought that damn' light gadget here with him? }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Wallace wondered. }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Why? He }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
glanced at the briefcase. }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Didn't know it was that small ... but maybe he's just talking about the plans for it.}{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
\par 'Let's keep our minds on this hearing,' Wallace whispered. 'This is the only thing that's important.'
\par Into a sudden lull in the room's high noise level, the voice of someone in the press section carried across them: 'greatest political show on earth.'
\par 'I brought this as an exhibit,' Custer said. Again, he tapped the briefcase. It }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 did }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 bulge oddly.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Exhibit? }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Wallace asked himself.
\par It was the second time in ten minutes that Custer had shocked him. This was to be a hearing of a subcommittee of the Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. The issue was Taylor grazing lands. What the devil could that ... }{
\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 gadget }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 have to do with the battle of words and laws to be fought here?
\par 'You're supposed to talk over all strategy with your attorney,' Wallace whispered. 'What the devil do you ... '
\par He broke off as the room fell suddenly silent.
\par Wallace looked up to see the subcommittee chairman, Senator Haycourt Tiborough, stride through the wide double doors followed by his coterie of investigators and atto
rneys. The senator was a tall man who had once been fat. He had dieted with such savage abruptness that his skin had never recovered. His jowls and the flesh on the back of his hands sagged. The top of his head was shiny bald and ringed by a three-quarter
 tonsure that had purposely been allowed to grow long and straggly so that it fanned back over his ears.
\par The senator was followed in close lock step by syndicated columnist Anthony Poxman who was speaking fiercely into Tiborough's left ear. TV cameras tracked the pair.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 If Poxman's covering this one himself instead of sending a flunky, it's going to be bad, }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Wallace told himself.
\par Tiborough took his chair at the center of the committee table feeing them, glanced left and right to assure himself the other members were present.
\par Senator Spealance was absent, Wallace noted, but he had party organization difficulties at home, and the Senior Senator from Oregon was, significantly, not present. Illness, it was reported.
\par A sudden attack of caution, that common Washington malady, no doubt. He knew where his campaign money came from ... but he also knew where the votes were.
\par They had a quorum, though.
\par Tiborough cleared his throat, said: 'The committee will please come to order.'
\par 
\par The senator's voice and manner gave Wallace a cold chill. }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 We were nuts trying to fight this one in the open, }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 he thought. }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
Why 'd I let Custer and his friends talk me into this? You can't butt heads with a United States senator who's out to get you. The only way's to fight him on the inside.}{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 And now Custer suddenly turned screwball.}{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752

\par 'Gentlemen,' said Tiborough, 'I think we can ... that is, today we can dispense with preliminaries ... unless my colleagues ... if any of them have objections.'
\par Again, h
e glanced at the other senators - five of them. Wallace swept his gaze down the line behind that table - Flowers of Nebraska (a horse trader), Johnstone of Ohio (a parliamentarian -devious), Lane of South Carolina (a Republican in Democrat disguise), Emer
y of Minnesota (new and eager - dangerous because he lacked the old inhibitions) and Meltzer of New York (poker player, fine old family with traditions).
\par None of them had objections.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 They've had a private meeting - both sides of the aisle - and talked over a smooth steamroller procedure, }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Wallace thought.
\par It was another ominous sign.
\par 'This is a subcommittee of the United States Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs,' Tiborough said, his tone formal. 'We are charged with obtaining expert opinion on 
proposed amendments to the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934. Today's hearing will begin with testimony and ... ah, questioning of a man whose family has been in the business of raising beef cattle in Oregon for three generations.'
\par Tiborough smiled at the TV cameras.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 The son-of-a-bitch is playing to the galleries, }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
Wallace thought. He glanced at Custer. The cattleman sat relaxed against the back of his chair, eyes half lidded, staring at the senator.
\par 'We call as our first witness today Mr William R. Custer of Bend, Oregon,' Tiborough said. 'Will the clerk please swear in Mr Custer.'
\par Custer moved forward to the 'hot seat', placed his briefcase on the table. Wallace pulled a chair up beside his client, noted how the cameras turned as the clerk stepped forward, put the Bible on the table and administered the oath.
\par Tiborough ruffled through some papers in front of him, waited for full attention to return to him, said: 'This subcommittee ... we have before us a bill, this is a United States Senate Bill entitled SB-1024 of
 the current session, an act amending the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 and, the intent is, as many have noted, that we would broaden the base of the advisory committees to the Act and include a wider public representation.'
\par 
\par Custer was fiddling with the clasp of his briefcase.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 How the hell could that light gadget be an exhibit here? }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
Wallace asked himself. He glanced at the set of Custer's jaw, noted the nervous working of a muscle. It was the first sign of unease he'd seen in Custer. The sight failed to settle Wallace's own nerves.
\par 'Ah, Mr Custer,' Tiborough said. 'Do you - did you bring a preliminary statement? Your counsel ... '
\par 'I have a statement,' Custer said. His big voice rumbled through the room, requiring instant attention and the shift of cameras that had been holding tardily on Tiborough, expecting an addition to the question.
\par Tiborough smiled, waited, then: 'Your attorney - is your statement the one your counsel supplied the committee?'
\par 'With some slight additions of my own' Custer said.
\par Wallace felt a sudden qualm. They were too willing to accept Custer's statement. He leaned close to his client's ear, whispered: 'They know what your stand is. Skip the preliminaries.'
\par Custer ignored him, said: 'I intend to speak plainly and simply. I oppose the amen
dment. Broaden the base and wider public representation are phases of political double talk. The intent is to pack the committees, to put control of them into the hands of people who don't know the first thing about the cattle business and whose private i
ntent is to destroy The Taylor Grazing Act itself.'
\par 'Plain, simple talk,' Tiborough said. 'This committee ... we welcome such directness. Strong words. A majority of this committee ... we have taken the position that the public range lands have been too lon
g subjected to the tender mercies of the stockmen advisors, that the lands ... stockmen have exploited them to their own advantage.'
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 The gloves were off. }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Wallace thought. }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 I hope Custer knows what he's doing. }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 
He's sure as hell not accepting advice.}{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Custer pulled a sheaf of papers from his briefcase and Wallace glimpsed shiny metal in the case before the flap was closed.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Christ! That looked like a gun or something!}{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
\par Then Wallace recognized the papers - the brief he and his staff had labored over - and the preliminary statement. He noted with alarm the penciled markings and marginal notations. How could Custer have done that much to it in just twenty-four hours?

\par Again, Wallace whispered in Custer's ear: 'Take it easy, Bill. The bastard's out for blood.'
\par Custer nodded to show he had heard, glanced at the papers, looked up directly at Tiborough.
\par A hush settled on the room, broken only by the scraping of a chair somewhere in the rear, and the whirr of cameras.

\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 'First, the nature of these lands
 we're talking about,' Custer said. 'In my state ... ' He cleared his throat, a mannerism that would have indicated anger in the old man, his father. There was no break in Custer's expression, though, and his voice remained level.' ... in my state, these 
were mostly Indian lands. This nation took them by brute force, right of conquest. That's about the oldest right in the world, I guess. I don't want to argue with it at this point.'
\par 'Mr Custer.'
\par It was Nebraska's Senator Flowers, his amiable farmer's face set in a tight grin. 'Mr Custer, I hope.'
\par 'Is this a point of order?' Tiborough asked.
\par 'Mr Chairman,' Flowers said, 'I merely wished to make sure we weren't going to bring up that old suggestion about giving these lands back to the Indians.'
\par Laughter shot across the hearing room. Tiborough chuckled as he pounded his gavel for order.
\par 'You may continue, Mr Custer,' Tiborough said.
\par Custer looked at Flowers, said: 'No, Senator, I don't want to give these lands back to the Indians. When they had these lands, they
 only got about three hundred pounds of meat a year off eighty acres. We get five hundred pounds of the highest grade proteins -premium beef - from only ten acres.'
\par 'No one doubts the efficiency of your factory-like methods,' Tiborough said. 'You can ... we know your methods wring the largest amount of meat from a minimum acreage.'
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Ugh I }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Wallace thought. }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 That was a low blow - implying Bill's overgrazing and destroying the land value.}{
\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
\par 'My neighbors, the Warm Springs Indians, use the same methods I do,' Custe

\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 'Has Mr Custer finished his preliminary statement yet?' Senator Flowers cut in.

\par 'Thank you, Senator,' Custer s

\par 'I concede that your methods must be the most modern in the world,' Tiborough said. 'It's not your methods as much as the results of those methods that are at issue here. }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 We ... '
\par 
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 He broke off at a disturbance by the door. An Army colonel was talking to the guard there. He wore Special Services fouragere -Pentagon.
\par Wallace noted with an odd feeling of disquiet that the man was armed - a .45 at the hip. The weapon was out of place on him, as though he had added it suddenly on an overpowering need ... emergency.
\par More guards were coming up outside the door now - Marines and Army. They carried rifles.
\par The colonel said something sharp to the guard, turned away from him and entered the committee room. All the cameras were tracking him now. He ignored them, crossed swiftly to Tiborough and spoke to him.
\par The senator shot a startled glance at Custer, accepted a sheaf of papers the colonel thrust at him. He forced his attention off Custer, studied the papers, leafing through them. Presently, he looked up, stared at Custer.
\par A hush fell over the room.
\par 'I find myself at a loss, Mr Custer,' Tiborough said. 'I have here a copy of a report ... it's from the Special Services branch of the Army ... through the Pentagon, you understand. It was just handed to me by, ah ... the colonel here.'
\par He looked up at the colonel who was standing, one hand resting lightly on the bolstered .45. Tiborough looked back at Custer and it was obvious the senator was trying to marshall his thoughts.
\par 'It is,' Tiborough said, 'that is ... this report
 supposedly ... and I have every confidence it is what it is represented to be ... here in my hands ... they say that ... uh, within the last, uh, few days they have, uh, investigated a certain device ... weapon they call it, that you are attempting to pa
tent. They report ... ' He glanced at the papers, back to Custer, who was staring at hire steadily.' ... this, uh, weapon, is a thing that ... it is extremely dangerous.'
\par 'It is,' Custer said.
\par 'I ... ah, see.' Tiborough cleared his throat, glanced up at the colonel who was staring fixedly at Custer. The senator brought his attention back to Custer.
\par 'Do you in fact have such a weapon with you, Mr Custer?' Tiborough asked.
\par 'I have brought it as an exhibit, sir.'
\par 'Exhibit?'
\par 'Yes, sir.'
\par Wallace rubbed his lips, found them dry. He wet them with his tongue, wished for the water glass, but it was beyond Custer. }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Christ! That stupid cowpuncher! }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
He wondered if he dared whisper to Custer. Would the senators and that Pentagon lackey interpret such an action as meaning he was part of Custer's crazy antics?
\par 'Are you threatening this committee with your weapon, Mr Custer?' Tiborough asked. 'If you are, I may say special precautions have been taken ... extra guards in this room and we ... that is, we will not allow ourselves 
to worry too much about any action you may take, but ordinary precautions are in force.'
\par 
\par Wallace could no longer sit quietly. He tugged Custer's sleeve, got an abrupt shake of the head. He leaned close, whispered: 'We could ask for a recess, Bill. Maybe we ... '
\par 'Don't interrupt me,' Custer said. He looked at Tiborough. 'Senator, I would not threaten you or any other man. Threats in the way you mean them are a thing we no longer can indulgs in.'
\par 'You ... I believe you said this device is an exhibit,' Tiborough said. He cast a worried frown at the report in his hands. 'I fail ... it does not appear germane.'
\par Senator Plowers cleared his throat. 'Mr Chairman,' he said.
\par 'The chair recognizes the senator from Nebraska,' Tiborough said, and the relief in his voice was obvious. He wanted time to think.
\par 'Mr Custer,' Plowers said, 'I have not seen the report, the report my distinguished colleague alludes to; however, if I may ... is it your wish to use this committee as some kind of publicity device?'
\par 'By no means, Senator,' Custer said. 'I don't wish to profit by my presence here ... not at all.'
\par Tiborough had apparently come to a decision. He leaned back, whispered to the colonel, who nodded and returned to the outer hall.
\par 'You strike me as an eminently reasonable man, Mr Custer,' Tiborough said. 'If I may ... '
\par 'May I,' Senator Plowers said. 'May I, just permit me to conclude this one point. May we have the Special Services report in the record?'
\par 'Certainly,' Tiborough said. 'But what I was about to suggest.'
\par 'May I,' Plowers said. 'May I, would you permit me, please, Mr Chairman, to make this point clear for the record?'
\par Tiborough scowled, but the heavy dignity of the Senate overcame his irritation. 'Please continue, Senator, I had thought you were finished.'
\par 'I respect ... there is no doubt in my mind of Mr Custer's truthfulness,' Flowers said. His face eased into a grin that made him look grandfatherly, a kindly elder statesman. 'I would like, therefore, to have him explain how this ... ah, weapon, c
an be an exhibit in the matter before our committee.'
\par Wallace glanced at Custer, saw the hard set of the man's jaw, realized the cattleman had gotten to Flowers somehow. This was a set piece.
\par Tiborough was glancing at the other senators, weighing the advisability of high-handed dismissal ... perhaps a star chamber session. No ... they were all too curious about Custer's device, his purpose here.
\par The thoughts were plain on the senator's face.
\par 'Very well,' Tiborough said. He nodded to Custer. 'You may proceed, Mr Custer.'
\par 
\par 'During last winter's slack season,' Custer said, 'two of my men and I worked on a project we've had in the works for three years -to develop a sustained-emission laser device.'
\par Custer opened his briefcase, slid out a fat aluminium tube mounted on a pistol grip with a conventional appearing trigger.
\par 'This is quite harmless,' he said. 'I didn't bring the power pack.'
\par 'That is ... this is your weapon?' Tiborough asked.
\par 'Calling this a weapon is misleading,' Custer said. 'The term limits and oversimplifies. This is also a brush-cutter, a substitute for a logger's saw and axe, a diamond cutter, a milling machine ... and a weapon. It is also a turning point in history.'

\par 'Come now, isn't that a bit pretentious?' Tiborough asked.
\par 'We tend to think of history as something old and slow,' Custer said. 'But history is, as a matter of fact, extremely rapid and immediate. A President is assassinated, a bomb explodes over a city, a dam break, a revolutionary device is announced.'
\par 'Lasers have been known for quite a few years,' Tiborough said. He looked at the papers the colonel had given him. 'The principle dates from 1956 or thereabouts.'
\par 'I don't wish it to appear that I'm taking credit for inventing this device,' Custer said. 'Nor am I claiming sole credit for developing the sustained-emission laser. I was merely one of a team. But I do hold the device here in my hand, gentlemen.'
\par 'Exhibit, Mr Custer,' Flowers reminded him. 'How is this an exhibit?'
\par 'May I explain first how it works?' Custer asked. 'That will make the rest of my statement much easier.'
\par Tiborough looked at Plowers, back to Custer. 'If you will tie this all together, Mr Custer,' Tiborough said. 'I want to ... the bearing of this device on our - we are hearing a particular bill in this room.'
\par '
Certainly, Senator,' Custer said. He looked at his device. 'A ninety-volt radio battery drives this particular model. We have some that require less voltage, some that use more. We aimed for a construction with simple parts. Our crystals are common quartz
. We shattered them by bringing them to a boil in water and then plunging them into ice water ... repeatedly. We chose twenty pieces of very close to the same size - about one gram, slightly more than fifteen grains each.'
\par Custer unscrewed the back of the tube, slid out a round length of plastic trailing lengths of red, green, brown, blue and yellow wire.
\par Wallace noticed how the cameras of the TV men centered on the object in Custer's hands. Even the senators were leaning forward, staring.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 We're gadget crazy people, }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Wallace thought.
\par 'The crystals were dipped in thinned household cement and then into iron filings,' Custer said. 'We made a little jig out of a fly-tying vice and opened a passage in the filings at opposite ends o
f the crystals. We then made some common celluloid - nitrocellulose, acetic acid, gelatin and alcohol - all very common products, and formed it in a length of garden hose just long enough to take the crystals end to end. The crystals were inserted in the 
h
ose, the celluloid poured over them and the whole thing was seated in a magnetic waveguide while the celluloid was cooling. This centered and aligned the crystals. The waveguide was constructed from wire salvaged from an old TV set and built following the
 directions in the Radio Amateur's Handbook.'
\par Custer re-inserted the length of plastic into the tube, adjusted the wires. There was an unearthly silence in the room with only the cameras whirring. }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 It was as though everyone were holding his breath.
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 'A laser 
requires a resonant cavity, but that's complicated,' Custer said. 'Instead, we wound two layers of fine copper wire around our tube, immersed it in the celluloid solution to coat it and then filed one end flat. This end took a piece of mirror cut to fit. 
We then pressed a number eight embroidery needle at right angles into the mirror end of the tub; until it touched the side of the number one crystal.'
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 Custer cleared his throat.
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Two of the senators leaned back. Plowers coughed. Tiborough glanced at the banks of TV cameras and there was a questioning look in his eyes.
\par 
\par 'We then determined the master frequency of our crystal series,'
\par Custer said. 'We used a test signal and oscilloscope, but any radio amateur could do it without the oscilloscope. We constructed
 an oscillator of that master frequency, attached it at the needle and a bare spot scraped in the opposite edge of the waveguide.'
\par 'And this ... ah ... worked?' Tiborough asked.
\par 'No.' Custer shook his head. 'When we fed power through a voltage multiplier into the system we produced an estimated four hundred joules emission and melted half the tube. }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 So we started all over again.'
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 'You are going to tie this in?' Tiborough asked. He frowned at the papers in his hands, glanced toward the door where the colonel had gone.
\par 'I am, sir, believe me,' Custer said.
\par 'Very well, then,' Tiborough said.
\par 'So we started all over,' Custer said. 'But for the second celuloid dip we added bismuth - a saturate solution, actually. It stayed gummy and we had to paint over it with a 
sealing coat of the straight celluloid. We then coupled this bismuth layer through a pulse circuit so that it was bathed in a counter wave -180 degrees out of phase with the master frequency. We had, in effect, immersed the unit in a thermoelectric cooler
 that exactly countered the heat production. A thin beam issued from the unmirrored end when we powered it. We have yet to find something that thin beam cannot cut.'
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 'Diamonds?' Tiborough asked.
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 'Powered by less than two hundred volts, this device could cut
 our planet in half like a ripe tomato,' Custer said. 'One man could destroy an aerial armada with it, knock down ICBMs before they touched atmosphere, sink a fleet, pulverize a city. I'm afraid, sir, that I haven't mentally catalogued all the violent imp
lications of this device. The mind tends to boggle at the enormous power focused in ... }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 '
\par 'Shut down those TV cameras!'
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 It was Tiborough shouting, leaping to his feet and making a sweeping gesture to include the banks of cameras. The abrupt violence of his 
voice and gesture fell on the room like an explosion. 'Guards!' he called. 'You there at the door. Cordon off that door and don't let anyone out who heard this fool!' He whirled back to face Custer. 'You irresponsible idiot!'
\par 'I'm afraid, Senator,' Custer said, 'that you're locking the barn door many weeks too late.'
\par For a long minute of silence Tiborough glared at Custer. Then: 'You did this deliberately, eh?'

\par Tiborough sat back into his chair, still keeping his attention fastened on Custer. Piowsrs and Johnston on his right had their heads close together whispering fiercely. The other senators were dividing their attention between Custer and Tiborough, their e
yes wide and with no attempt to conceal their astonishment.
\par Wallace, growing conscious of the implications in what Custer had said, tried to wet his lips with his tongue. }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Christ! }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 he thought. }{

\par Tiborough sig
naled an aide, spoke briefly with him, beckoned the colonel from the door. There was a buzzing of excited conversation in the room. Several of the press and TV crew were huddled near the windows on Custer's left, arguing. One of their number - a florid-fa
ced man with gray hair and horn-rimmed glasses, started across the room toward Tiborough, was stopped by a committee aide. They began a low-voiced argument with violent gestures.
\par A loud curse sounded from the door. Foxman, the syndicated columnist, was trying to push past the guards there.
\par 'Poxman!' Tiborough called. The columnist turned. 'My orders are that no one leaves,' Tiborough said. 'You are not an exception.' He turned back to face Custer.
\par The room had fallen into a semblance of quiet, although there still were pockets of muttering and there was the sound of running feet and a hurrying about in the hall outside.
\par 'Two channels went out of here live,' Tiborough said. 'Nothing much we can do about them, although we will trace down as many of their viewer
s as we can. Every bit of film in this room and every sound tape will be confiscated, however.' His voice rose as protests sounded from the press section. 'Our national security is at stake. The President has been notified. Such measures as are necessary 
will be taken.'
\par The colonel came hurrying into the room, crossed to Tiborough, quietly said something.

\par 'Senator, this is not a happy-smile,' Custer said. 'But I told myself several days ago you'd fail to see the implications of this thing,' He tapped the pistol-shaped device he had rested on the table. 'I told myself you'd fall back into the old, useless p
attern.'
\par 'Is that what you told yourself, really?' }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 Tiborough said.
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Wallace, hearing the venom in the senator's voice, moved his chair a few inches farther away from Custer.

\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 In the long silence that followed, someone in the press section emitted a nervous guffaw.
\par 'Virtually every man on my r

derably more painful thought than you've applied to this problem. In my estimation, I had no choice. Every week I waited to make this thing public, every day, every minute, merely raised the odds that humanity would be destroyed by..:'
\par 'You said this thing applied to the hearings on the grazing act,' Flowers protested, and there was a plaintive note of complaint in his voice.
\par 'Senator, I told you the truth,' Custer said. 'There's no real reason to change the act, now. We intend to go on operating under it - with the agreement of our neighbors and others concerned. }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516

\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Tiborqugh glared at him. '
You're saying we can't force you to ... ' He broke off at a disturbance in the doorway. A rope barrier had been stretched there and a line of Marines stood with their backs to it, facing the hall. A mob of people was trying to press through. Press cards w
ere being waved.
\par 'Colonel, I told you to clear that hall!' Tiborough barked.
\par The colonel ran to the barrier. 'Use your bayonets if you have to!' he shouted.
\par The disturbance subsided at the sound of his voice. More, uniformed men could be seen moving in along the barrier. }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 Presently, the noise receded.
\par 
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Tiborough turned back to Custer. 'You make Benedict Arnold look like the greatest friend the United States ever had,' he said.
\par 'Cursing me isn't going to help you,' Custer said. 'You are going to have to live with this thing; so you'd better try understanding it.'
\par 'That appears to be simple,' Tiborough said. 'All I have to do is send twenty-five cents to the Patent office for the schematics and then write you a letter.'
\par 'The world already was headed toward suicide,' Custer said. 'Only fools failed to realize ... }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 '
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 'So you decided to give us a little push,' Tiborough said.
\par 'H. G. Wells warned us,' Custer said. 'That's how far back it goes, but nobody listened. 'Human history becomes more and more a race between ed
ucation and catastrophe,' Wells said. But those were just words. Many scientists have remarked the growth curve on the amount of raw energy becoming available to humans - and the diminishing curve on the number of persons required to use that energy. For 
a long time now, more and more violent power was being made available to fewer and fewer people. It was only a matter of time until total destruction was put into the hands of single individuals.'
\par 'And you didn't think you could take your government into your confidence.'
\par 'The government already was committed to a political course diametrically opposite the one this device requires,' Custer said, 'Virtually every man in the government has a vested interest in not reversing that course.'
\par 'So you set yourself above the government?'
\par 'I'm probably wasting my time,' Custer said, 'but I'll try to explain it. Virtually every government in the world is dedicated to manipulating something called the 'mass man'. That's how governments have stayed in power. But there is
 no such man. When you elevate the non-existent 'mass man' you degrade the individual. And obviously it was only a matter of time until all of us were at the mercy of the individual holding power.'
\par 'You talk like a commie!'
\par They'll say Pm a goddamn' capita
list pawn,' Custer said. 'Let me ask you, Senator, to visualize a poor radio technician in a South American country. Brazil, for example. He lives a hand-to-mouth existence, ground down by an overbearing, unimaginative, essentially uncouth ruling oligarch
y. What is he going to do when this device comes into his hands?'
\par 
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 'Murder, robbery and anarchy.'
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 'You could be right,' Custer said. 'But we might reach an understanding out of ultimate necessity - that each of us must cooperate in maintaining the dignity of all.'
\par Tiborough stared at him, began to speak musingly: 'We'll have to control the essential materials for constructing this thing ... and there may be trouble for awhile, but ... }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 '
\par 'You're a vicious fool.'
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 In the cold silence that followed, Custer said:
 'It was too late to try that ten years ago. I'm telling you this thing can be patch-worked out of a wide variety of materials that are already scatteredover the earth. It can be made in basements and mud huts, in palaces and shacks. The key item is the c
rystals, but other crystals will work, too. That's obvious. A patient man can grow crystals ... and this world is full of patient men.'
\par 'I'm going to place you under arrest,' Tiborough said. 'You have outraged every rule -'
\par 'You're living in a dream world,'
 Custer said. 'I refuse to threaten you, but I'll defend myself from any attempt to oppress or degrade me. If I cannot defend myself, my friends will defend me. No man who understands what this device means will permit his dignity to be taken from him.'

\par Custer allowed a moment for his words to sink in, then: 'And don't twist those words to imply a threat. Refusal to threaten a fellow human is an absolute requirement in the day that has just dawned on us.'
\par 'You haven't changed a thing!' Tiborough raged. 'If one man is powerful with that thing, a hundred are ... }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 '
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 'All previous insults aside,' Custer said, 'I think you are a highly intelligent man, Senator. I ask you to think long and hard about this device. Use of power is no longer the deciding factor beca

\par 'Senator!'
\par It was one of the TV cameramen in the left rear of the room.
\par 'Let's stop insulting Mr Custer and hear him out,' the cameraman said.
\par 'Get that man's name,' Tiborough told an aide. }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 'If he ... '
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 'I'm an expert electronic technician, Senator,' the man said. 'You can't threaten me now.'
\par 
\par Custer smiled, turned to face Tiborough.
\par 'The revolution begins,' Custer said. He waved a hand as the senator started to whirl away. 'Sit down, Senator.'
\par Wallace, watching the senator obey, saw how the balance of control had changed in this room.
\par 'Ideas are in the wind,' Custer said. 'There comes a time for a thing to develop. It comes into being. The spinning jenny came into being because that was its time. It was based on countless ideas that had preceded it.'
\par 'And this is the age of the laser?' Tiborough asked.
\par 'It was bound to come,' Custer said. 'But the number of people in the world who're filled with hate and frustration and violence has been growing with terrible speed. You add to that the enormous danger that this might fall into the han
ds of just one group or nation or ... ' Custer shrugged. 'This is too much power to be confined to one man or group with the hope they'll administer wisely. I didn't dare delay. That's why I spread this thing now and announced it as broadly as I could.'

\par Tiborough leaned back in his chair, his hands in his lap. His face was pale and beads of perspiration stood out on his forehead.
\par 'We won't make it.'
\par 'I hope you're wrong, Senator,' Custer said. 'But the only thing I know for sure is that we'd have had less chance of making it tomorrow than we have today.'

\par 'An escape-proof prison cannot be built,' he kept telling himself. His name was Roger Beirut, five feet tall, one hundred and three pounds, crewcut black hair, a narrow face with a long nose and wide mouth and space-bleached eyes that appeared to reflect 
rather than absorb what they saw.
\par Beirut knew his prison - the D-Service. He had got himself rooted down in the Service like a remittance man half asleep in a hammock on some palm-shaded tropical beach, telling himself his luck would change some day and he'd get out of there.
\par He didn't delude himself that a one-man D-ship was a hammock, or that space was a tropical beach. But the sinecure element was there and the ships were solicitous cocoons, each with a climate designed precisely for the lone occupant.
\par Th
at each pilot carried the prison's bars in his mind had taken Beirut a long time to understand. Out here aimed into the void beyond Capella Base, he could feel the bars where they had been dug into his psyche, cemented and welded there. He blamed the oper
ators of Bu-psych and the deep-sleep hypnotic debriefing after each search trip. He told himself that Bu-psych did something to the helpless pilots then installed this compulsion they called the }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Push.}{
\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
\par Some young pilots managed to escape it for a while - tougher psyches, probably, but sooner or later, Bu-psych got them all. It was a common compulsion that limited the time a D-ship pilot could stay out before he turned tail and fled for home.
\par 'This time I'll break away,' Beirut told himself. He knew he was talking aloud, but he had his computer's vocoders turned off and his absent mumblings would be ignored.
\par The gas cloud of Grand Nuage loomed ahead of him, clearly defined on his instruments like a piece of torn fabric thrown across the stars. He'd come out of subspace dangerously close, but that was the gamble he'd taken.
\par Bingaling Benar, fellow pilot and sometime friend, had called him nuts when Beirut had said he was going to tackle the cloud.
\par 'Didn't you do that once before?' Bingaling asked.
\par 'I was going to once, but I changed my mind,' Beirut had said.
\par 'You gotta slow down, practically crawl in there,' Bingaling had said. 'I stood it in eighty-one days, man. I had the push for real - couldn't take any more and I came home. Anyway, it's nothing but cloud all the way through.'
\par Bingaling's }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 endless }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 cloud was growing larger in the ship's instruments now. But the cloud enclosed a mass of space that could hide a thousand suns.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Eighty-one days, }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 he thought.
\par 'Eighty, ninety days, that's all anyone can take out there,' Bingaling had said. 'And I'm telling you, in that cloud it's worse. You get the push practically the minute you go in.'
\par 
\par Beirut had his ship down to a safe speed now, nosing into the first tenuous layers. There was no mystery about the cloud's composition, he reminded himself. It was hydrogen, but in a concentration that made swift flight suicidal.
\par 'They got this theory,' Bingaling had said, 'that it's an embryo star like. One day it's just going to go fwoosh and compress down into one star mass.'
\par Beirut e
ased the controls. He could sense his ship around him like an extension of his own nerves. She was a pinnacle class for which he and his fellow pilots had a simple and obscene nickname - two hundred and fifty meters long, crowded from nose to tubes with t
he equipment for determining if a planet could support human life. In the sleep-freeze compartment directly behind him were the double-checks - two pairs of rhesus monkeys and ten pairs of white mice.
\par D-ship pilots contended they'd seeded more planets with rhesus monkeys and white mice than they had with humans.
\par Beirut switched to his stern instruments. One hour into the cloud and already the familiar stars behind him were beginning to fuzz off. He felt the first stirrings of unease; not the push ... but disquiet.
\par He crossed his arms, touching the question-mark insignia at his left shoulder. He could feel the ripe green film of corrosion on the brass threads. }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 I should polish up, }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
he thought. But he knew he wouldn't. He looked around him at the pilot compartment, seeing unracked food cannisters, a grease smear across the computer console, dirty fatigues wadded under a dolly seat.
\par It was a sloppy ship.
\par Beirut knew what was said about him and his fellow pilots back in the top echelons of the D-Service.
\par 'Rogues make the best searchers.'
\par It was an axiom, but the rogues had their drawbacks. They flouted rules, sneered at protocol, ignored timetables, laughed at vector search plans ... and kept sloppy ships. And when they disappeared - as they often did - the Service c
ould never be sure what had happened or where.
\par Except that the man had been prevented from returning ... because there was always the push.
\par Beirut shook his head. Every thought seemed to come back to the push. He didn't have it yet, he assured himself. Too soon. But the thought was there, aroused. It was the fault of that cloud.
\par He re-activated the rear scanners. The familiar stars were gone, swallowed in a blanket of nothingness. Angrily, he turned off the scanner switch.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 I've got to keep busy, }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 he thought.
\par For a time he set himself to composing and refining a new stanza for the endless D-ship ballad: 'I Left My Love On Lyra In The Hands Of Gentle Friends.' But his mind kept returning to the fact that the stanza might never be heard ... if his plans succe
eded. He wondered then how many such stanzas had been composed never to be heard.
\par 
\par The days went by with an ever-slowing, dragging monotony.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Eighty-one days, }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 he reminded himself time and again. }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Bingaling turned back at eighty-one days.}{
\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
\par By the seventy-ninth day he could see why. There was no doubt then that he was feeling the first ungentle suasions of the push. His mind kept searching for logical reasons.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 You've done your best. No shame in turning back now. Bingaling's undoubtedly right - it's nothing but cloud all the way through. No stars in here }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 ... no }{
\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 planets.}{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
\par But he was certain what the Bu-psych people had done to him and this helped. He watched the forward scanners for the first sign of a glow. And this helped, too. He was still going some place.
\par The eighty-first day passed.
\par The eighty-second.
\par On the eighty-sixth day he began to see a triple glow ahead - like lights through fog; only the fog was black and otherwise empty.
\par By this time it was taking a conscious effort to keep his hands from straying toward the flip-flop controls that would turn the ship one hundred eighty degrees onto its return track.
\par Three lights in the emptiness.
\par Ninety-four days - two days longer than he'd ever withstood the push before - and his ship swam free of the cloud into open 
space with three stars lined out at a one o'clock angle ahead of him - a distant white-blue giant, a nearby orange dwarf and in the center ... a lovely golden sol-type to the fifth decimal of comparison.
\par Feverishly, Beirut activated his mass-anomaly scanners, probing space around the golden-yellow sun.
\par The push was terrible now, insisting that he turn around. But this was the final convincer for Beirut . If the thing Bu-psych had done to him insisted he go back now, right after discovering three new suns - 
then there could be only one answer to the question 'Why?' They didn't want a B-Service rogue settling down on his own world. The push was a built-in safeguard to make sure the scout returned.
\par Beirut forced himself to study his instruments.
\par Presently, the 
golden star gave up its secret - a single planet with a single moon. He punched for first approximation, watched the resultsstutteroff the feedout tape: planetarymass .998421 of Earth norm ... rotation forty plus standard hours ... mean orbital distance 2
43 million kilometers ... perturbation nine degrees ... orbital variation thirty-eight plus.
\par Beirut sat bolt upright with surprise.
\par 
\par Thirty-eight plus! A variation percentage in that range could only mean the mother star had another companion - and a big one. He searched space around the star.
\par Nothing.
\par Then he saw it.
\par At first he thought he'd spotted the drive flare of another ship -an alien. He swallowed, the push momentarily subdued, and did a quick mental review of the alien-space contact routine worked out by Earth's bigdomes and which, so far as anyone knew, had n
ever been put to the test.
\par The flare grew until it resolved itself into the gaseous glow of another astronomical body circling the golden sun.
\par Again, Beirut bent to his instruments. My God, how the thing moved! More than forty kilometers per second. Tape be
gan spewing from the feedout: Mass 321.64 ... rotation nine standard hours ... mean orbital distance 58 million kilometers ... perturbation blank (insufficient data) ...
\par Beirut shifted to the filtered visual scanners, watched the companion sweep across the
 face of its star and curve out of sight around the other side. The thing looked oddly familiar, but he knew he could never have seen it before. He wondered if he should activate the computer's vocoder system and talk to it through the speaker embedded in
 his neck, but the computer annoyed him with its obscene logic.
\par The astronomical data went into the banks, though, for the experts to whistle and marvel over later.
\par Beirut shifted his scanners back to the planet. Shadowline measurement gave it an atmosphere that reached fade-off at an altitude of about a hundred and twenty-five kilometers. The radiation index indicated a whopping tropical belt, almost sixty degrees.

\par With a shock of awareness, Beirut found his hands groping toward the flip-flop controls. He j
erked back, trembling. If he once turned the ship over, he knew he wouldn't have the strength of purpose to bring her back around. The push had reached terrifying intensity.
\par Beirut forced his attention onto the landing problem, began feeding data into the 
computer for the shortest possible space-to-ground course. The computer offered a few objections 'for his own good,' but he insisted. Presently, a landing tape appeared and he fed it into the control console, strapped down, kicked the ship onto automatic 
and sat back perspiring. His hands held a death grip on the sides of his crash-pad.
\par The B-ship began to buck with the first skipping-flat entrance into the planet's atmosphere. The bucking stopped, returned, stopped - was repeated many times. The B-ship's c
ooling system whined. Hull plates creaked. Darkside, lightside, darkside - they repeated themselves in his viewer. The automatic equipment began reeling out atmospheric data: oxygen 23.9, nitrogen 74.8, argon 0.8, carbon dioxide 0.04 ... By the time it go
t into the trace elements, Beirut was gasping with the similarity to the atmosphere of Mother Earth.
\par The spectrum analyzer produced the datum that the atmosphere was essentially transparent from 3,000 angstroms to 6 X 10}{\fs20\super\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 4}{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752  angstroms. It was a confirmation an
d he ignored the instruments when they began producing hydromagnetic data and water vapor impingements. There was only one important fact here: he could breathe the stuff out there.
\par Instead of filling him with a sense of joyful discovery - as it might have thirty or forty days earlier - this turned on a new spasm of the push. He had to consciously restrain himself from clawing at the instrument panel.
\par Beirut 's teeth began to chatter.
\par The viewer showed him an island appearing over the horizon. The B-ship sw
ept over it. Beirut gasped at sight of an alabaster ring of tall buildings hugging the curve of a bay. Bots on the water resolved into sailboats as he neared. How oddly familiar it all looked.
\par Then he was past and headed for a mainland with a low range of hills -more buildings, roads, the patchwork of fenced lands. Then he was over a wide range of prairie with herds of moving animals on it.
\par Beirut 's fingers curled into claws. His skin trembled.
\par The landing jets cut in and his seat reversed itself. The ship nosed up and the seat adjusted to the new attitude. There came a roaring as the ship lowered itself on its tail jets. The proximity cut-off killed all engines.
\par The B-ship settled with a slight jolt.
\par 
\par Blue smoke and clouds of whirling ashes lifted past Bei
rut 's scanners from the scorched landing circle. Orange flames swept through dry forage on his right, but the chemical automatics from the ship's nose sent a borate shower onto the fire and extinguished it. Beirut saw the backs of animals fleeing through
 
the smoke haze beyond the fire. Amplification showed them to be four-legged, furred and with tiny flat heads. They ran like bouncing balls. A light band of fear cinched on Beirut 's chest. This place was too earthlike. His teeth chattered with the unconsc
ious demands of the push.
\par His instruments informed him they were picking up modulated radio signals - FM and AM. A light showing that the Probe-Test-Watch circuits were activated came alive. Computer response circuit telltales began flickering. Abruptly, th
e P-T-W bell rang, telling him: 'Something approaches!'
\par The viewer showed a self-propelled vehicle rolling over a low hill to the north supported by what appeared to be five monstrous pneumatic bladders. It headed directly toward the B-ship belching pale w
hite smoke from a rear stack with the rhythm of steam power. External microphones picked up the confirming 'chuff-chuff-chuff' an' his computer announced that it was a double-action engine with sounds that indicated five opposed pairs of pistons.
\par A five-sided dun brown cab with dark blue-violet windows overhung the front of the thing.
\par In his fascination with the machine, Beirut almost forgot the wild urge pushing at him from within. The machine pulled up about fifty meters beyond the charred landing circle,
 extruded a muzzle that belched a puff of smoke at him. The external microphones picked up a loud explosion and the D-ship rocked on its extended tripods.
\par Beirut clutched the arms of his chair then sprang to the controls of the ship's automatic defenses, poised a hand over the disconnect switch.
\par The crawling device outside whirled away, headed east toward a herd of the bouncing animals.
\par Beirut punched the 'Warning-Only' button.
\par A giant gout of earth leaped up ahead of the crawler, brought it to a lurching halt at the brink of a smoking hole. Another gout of earth bounced skyward at the left of the machine; another at the right.
\par Beirut punched 'Standby' on the defense mechanisms, 
turned to assess the damage. Any new threat from the machine out there and the B-ship's formidable arsenal would blast it out of existence. That was always a step to be avoided, though, and he kept one eye on the screen showing the thing out there. It sat
 unmoving but still chuffing on the small patch of earth left by the three blast-shots from the ship.
\par Less than ten seconds later, the computer out-chewed a strip of tape that said the ship's nose section had been blasted open, all proximity detectors destroyed. Beirut was down on this planet until he could make repairs.
\par Oddly, this eased the pressures of the push within him. It was still there and he could sense it, but the compulsive drive lay temporarily idle as though it, top, had a standby switch.
\par Beirut returned his attention to the crawler.
\par The damage had been done, and there was no helping it. A ship could land with its arsenal set on 'Destroy,' but deciding what needed destruction was a delicate proposition. Wise counsel said you let the other side g
et in a first shot if their technology appeared sufficiently primitive. Otherwise, you might make yourself decidedly unwelcome.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Who'd have thought they'd have a cannon and fire the thing without warning? }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 he asked himself. And the reply stood there accusingly in his mind: }{
\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 You should've thought of it, stupid. Gunpowder and steam-power are almost always concurrent.}{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Well, I was too upset by the push, }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 he thought. }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Besides, why'd they fire without warning?}{
\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
\par 
\par Again, the crawler's cab extruded the cannon muzzle and the cab started to turn to bring the weapon to bear on the ship. A warning blast sent earth cascading into the hole at the left of the crawler. The cab stopped turning.
\par 'That's-a-baby,' Beirut said. 'Easy does it, fellows. Let's be friends.' He nicked a blu
e switch at the left side of his board. His external microphones damped out as a klaxon sent its bull roar toward the crawler. It was a special sound capable of intimidating almost any creature that heard it. The sound had an astonishing effect on the cra
wler. A hatch in the middle of the cab popped open and five creatures boiled out of it to stand on the deck of their machine.
\par Beirut keyed the microphone beside him into the central computer, raised amplification on his view of the five creatures from the machine. He began reading off his own reactions. The human assessment always helped the computer's sensors.
\par 'Humanoid,' he said. 'Upright tubular bodies about a meter and a half tall with two legs encased in some kind pf boot. Sack-like garments belted at t
he waist. Each has five pouches dangling from the belt. Number five is significant here. Flesh color is pale blue-violet. Two arms; articulation - humanoid, but very long forearm. Wide hands with six fingers; looks like two opposable thumbs, one to each s
ide of the hand. Heads - squarish, domed, covered with what appears to be a dark blue-violet beret. Eyes semi-stalked, yellow and just inside the front }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 corners }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
of the head. Those heads are very blocky. I suspect the eyes can be twisted to look behind without turning the head.'
\par The creatures began climbing down off their machine. Beirut went on with his description: 'Large mouth orifice centered beneath the eyes. There appears to be a chin articulation on a short hinge. Orifice lipless, ovoid, no apparent tee
th ... correction: there's a dark line inside that may be the local equivalent. Separate small orifices below each eye stalk - possibly for breathing. One just turned its head. I see a slight indentation centered on the side of the head - purpose unknown.
 It doesn't appear to be an ear.'
\par The five were advancing on the ship now; Beirut backed off the scanner to keep them in view, said: 'They carry bows and arrows. That's odd, considering the cannon. Each has a back quiver with ... five arrows. That five agai
n. Bows slung on the string over left shoulder. Each has a short lance in a back harness, a blue-violet pennant just below the lance head. Some kind of figure on the pennant - looks like an upside down 'U' in orange. Same figure repeated on the front of t
heir tunics which are also blue-violet. Blue-violet and five. What's the prognosis?'
\par Beirut waited for the computer's answer to come to him through the speaker grafted into his neck. Relays clicked and the vocoder whispered through the bones of his head: 'P
robable religious association with color and number five. Extreme caution is indicated on religious matters. Body armor and hand weapon mandatory.'
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 That's the trouble with computers, }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Beirut thought. }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Too logical.}{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
\par The five natives had stopped just outside the fire-blackened landing circle. They raised their arms to the ship, chanted something that sounded like 'Toogayala-toogayala-toogayala.' The sound came from the oval central orifice.
\par 'We'll toogayala in just a minute,' Beirut muttered. He brought out a Bo
rgen machine pistol, donned body armor, aimed two of the ship's bombards directly at the steam wagon and set them on a dead-man switch keyed to a fifteen-second stoppage of his heart. He rigged the stern port to the PTW syslem, keyed to blow up any unauth
o
rized intruders. Into various pockets he stuffed a lingua pack receptor tuned to his implanted speaker through the computer, a standard contact kit for sampling whatever interested him, a half dozen minigrenades, energy tablets, food analyzer, a throwing 
knife in a sheath, a miniscanner linked to the shipcomputer and a slingshot. With a final, grim sensation, he stuffed a medikit under the armor next to his heart.
\par One more glance around the familiar control center and he slid down the tube to the stern port, opened it and stepped out.
\par 
\par The five natives threw themselves flat on the ground, arms extended toward him.
\par Beirut took a moment to study them and his surroundings. There was a freshness to the air that even his nose filters could not diminish. It was mo
rning here yet and the sun threw flat light against the low hills and clumps of scrub. They stood out with a clean chiaroscuro dominated by the long blue spear of the ship's shadow wavering across the prairie.
\par Beirut looked up at his B-ship. She was a red 
and white striped tower on his side with a gaping hole where the nose should have been. Her number - 1107 - stenciled in luminous green beneath the nose had just escaped the damage area. He returned his attention to the natives.
\par They remained stretched out on the grass, their stalked eyes stretched out and peering up at him.
\par 'Let's hope you have a good metal-working industry, friends,' Beirut said. 'Otherwise, I'm going to be an extremely unhappy visitor.'
\par At the sound of his voice, the five grunted in unison: 'Toogayala ung-ung.'
\par 'Ung-ung?' Beirut asked. 'I thought we were going to toogaya-la.' He brought out the linguapack, hung it on his chest with the mike aimed at the natives, moved toward them out of t
he ship's shadow. As an afterthought, he raised his right hand, palm out and empty in the universal human gesture of peace, but kept his left hand on the Borgen.
\par 'Toogayala!' the five screamed.
\par His linguapack remained silent. Toogayala and ung-ung were hardly sufficient for breaking down a language.
\par Beirut took another step toward them.
\par The five rocked back to then: knees and arose, crouching and apparently poised for flight. Five pairs of stalked eyes pointed toward him. Beirut had the curious feeling then
 that the five appeared familiar. They looked a little like giant grasshoppers that had been crossed with an ape. They looked like bug-eyed monsters from a work of science fantasy he had read in his youth, which he saw as clear evidence that what the imag
ination of man could conceive, nature could produce.
\par Beirut took another step toward the natives, said: 'Well, let's talk a little, friends. Say something. Make language, huh.'
\par The five backed up two steps. Their feet made a dry rustling sound in the grass.
\par Beirut swallowed. Their silence was a bit unnerving.
\par Abruptly, something emitted a buzzing sound. It seemed to come from a native on Beirut 's right. The creature clutched for its tunic, gabbled: 's'Chareecha! s'Chareecha!' It pulled a small object from a pocket to the others gathered around.
\par Beirut tensed, lifted the Borgen.
\par The natives ignored him to concentrate on the object in the one creature's hands.
\par 'What's doing?' Beirut asked. He felt tense, uneasy. This wasn't going at all the way the books said it should.
\par The five straightened suddenly and without a backward look, returned to their steam wagon and climbed into the cab.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 What test did I fail? }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Beirut wondered.
\par Silence settled over the scene.
\par 
\par In the course of becoming a B-ship pilot, Beirut had gain
ed fame for a certain pungency of speech. He paused a moment to practice some of his more famed selections, then took stock of his situation - standing here exposed at the foot of the ship while the unpredictable natives remained in their steam wagon. He 
clambered back through the port, sealed it, and jacked into the local computer outlet for a heart-to-heart conference.
\par 'The buzzing item was likely a timepiece,' the computer said. The creature in possession of it was approximately two millimeters taller than his tallest companion. 'There are indications this one is the leader of the group.'
\par 'Leader schmeader,' Beirut said. 'What's this toogayala they keep yelling?'
\par From long association with Beirut , the computer had adopted a response pattern to meet the rhetorical question or the question for which there obviously was no answer. 'Tut, tut,' it said.
\par 'You sound like my old Aunt Martha,' Beirut said. 'They screamed that toogayala. It's obviously important.'
\par 'When they noted your hand, that is when they raised their voices to the highest decibel level thus far recorded here,' the computer said.
\par 'But why?'
\par 'Possible answer,' the computer said. 'You have five fingers.'
\par 'Five,' Beirut said. }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 'Five ... five ... five ... '
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 'We detect only five heavenly bodies here,' the computer said. 'You have noted that the skies are otherwise devoid of stars. The rapid companion is overhead right now, you know.'
\par 'Five.' Beirut said.
\par 'This planet,' the computer said, 'the three hot gaseous and plasma bodies and the other companion to this planet's sun.'
\par Beirut looked at his hand, flexed the fingers.
\par 'They may think you are a deity,' the computer said. 'They have six fingers; you have five.'
\par 'Empty skies except for three suns,' Beirut said.
\par 'Don't forget this planet and the other companion,' the computer said.
\par Beirut thought about living on such a planet - no banks of stars across the heavens ... all that hidden behind the enclosing hydrogen cloud.
\par He began to tremble unaccountably with an attack of }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 the push.}{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
\par 'What'll it take to fix the nose of the ship?' Beirut asked. He tried to still his trembling.
\par 'A sophisticated machine shop and the work of electronics technicians of at least grade five. The repair data is available in my banks.'
\par 'What're they doing in that machine?' Beirut demanded. 'Why don't they talk?'
\par 'Tut, tut,' the computer said.
\par 
\par Thirty-eight minutes later, the natives again emerged from their steam wagon, took up stations standing at the edge of the charred ground.
\par 
\par Beirut repeated his precautionary measures, went out to join them. He moved slowly, warily, the Borgen ready in his left hand.
\par The five awaited him this time without retreating. They appeared more relaxed, chattering in low voices among themselves, watching him with th
ose stalked eyes. The word sounds remained pure gibberish to Beirut , but he had the lingua pack trained on them and knew the computer would have the language in a matter of time.
\par Beirut stopped about eight paces from the natives, said: 'Glad to see you, boys. Have a nice nap in your car?'
\par The tallest one nodded, said: 'What's doing?'
\par Beirut gaped, speechless.
\par A native on the left said: 'Let's hope you have a good metal-working industry, friends. Otherwise I'm going to be an extremely unhappy visitor.'
\par The tallest one said: 'Glad to see you, boys. Have a nice nap in your car?'
\par 'They're mimicking me!' Beirut gasped.
\par 'Confirmed,' the computer said.
\par Beirut overcame an urge to laugh, said: 'You're the crummiest looking herd of no-good animals I ever saw. It's a wonder your mothers could stand the sight of you.'
\par The tall native repeated it for him without an error.
\par 'Reference to mothers cannot be accepted at this time,' the computer said. 'Local propagation customs unknown. There are indications these may be part vegetable - part animal.'
\par 'Oh shut up,' Beirut said.
\par 'Oh, shut up,' said a native on his left.
\par 'Suggest silence on your part,' the computer said. 'They are displaying signs of trying to break down your-language. Better we get their language, reveal less of ourselves.'
\par Beirut saw the wisdom in it, spoke subvocally for the speaker on his throat: 'You're so right.'
\par He clamped his lips into a thin line, stared at the natives. Silence dragged on and on.
\par Presently the tall one said: 'Aagroop somilican.'
\par 'Toogayala,' said the one on the left.
\par 'Cardinal number,' the computer said. 'Probable position five. Hold up your five fingsrs and say toogayala.'
\par Beirut obeyed.
\par 'Toogayala, toogayala,' the natives agreed. One detached himself, went to the st a n wagon and returned with a black metal figurine, about half a meter tall, extended it toward Beirut .
\par Cautiously, Beirut moved forward, accepted the thing. It felt heavy and cold in his hand, ft was a beautifully styled figure of one of the natives, the eye stalks drooping into inverted U-shapes, mouth open.
\par Beirut brought out his contact kit, pressed it against the metal.
\par The kit went 'ping' as it took a sample.
\par The natives stared at him.
\par 'Iron-magnesium-nickel alloy,' the computer said. 'Figure achieved by casting. Approximate age of figure, twenty-five million standard years.'
\par Beirut felt his throat go dry. He spoke subvocally: 'That can't be!'
\par 'Bating accurate to plus or minus six thousand years,' the 
computer said. 'You will note the figures carved on the casting. The inverted U on the chest is probably the figure five. Beneath that is writing. Pattern too consistent for different interpretation.'
\par 'Civilization for twenty-five million years,' Beirut said.
\par 'Plus or minus six thousand years,' the computer said.
\par Again, Beirut felt a surge }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 ofthepush, }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 fought it down. He wanted to return to the crippled ship, flee this place in spite of the dangers. His knees shook.
\par The native who had given him the figurine, stepped forward, reclaimed it. 'Toogayala,' the native said. It pointed to the inverted U on the figure and then to the symbol on its own chest.
\par 'But they only have a steam engine,' Beirut protested.
\par 'Very sophisticated steam engine,' the computer said. 'Cannon is retractable, gyroscopically mounted, self-tracking.'
\par 'They can fix the ship!' Beirut said.
\par 'If they will,' the computer said.
\par The tall native stepped forward now, touched a finger to the lingua pack, said: 's'Chareecha' with a falling inflection. Beirut watched the hand carefully. It was six-fingered, definitely, the skin a mauve-blue. The fingers were horn-tipped and double-knu
ckled.
\par Try ung-ung,' the computer suggested.'
\par 'Ung-ung,' Beirut said.
\par 
\par The tall one jumped backward and all five sent their eye stalks peering toward the sky. They set up an excited chattering among themselves in which Beirut caught several repeated sounds: 'Yaubron ... s'Chareecha ... Autoga ... Sreese-sreese ... '
\par 'We have an approximation for entry now,' the computer said. 'The tall one is called Autoga. Address him by name.'
\par 'Autoga,' Beirut said.
\par The tall one turned, tipped his eye stalks toward Beirut .
\par 'Say }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Ai-Yaubron ung sreese s'Chareecha,' }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 the computer said.
\par Beirut obeyed.
\par The natives faced each other, returned their attention to Beirut . Presently, they began grunting almost uncontrollably. Autoga sat down on the ground, pounded it with his hands, all the while keeping up the grunting.
\par 'What the devil?' Beirut said.
\par 'They're laughing,' the computer said. 'Go sit beside Autoga.'
\par 'On the ground?' Beirut asked.
\par 'Yes.'
\par 'Is it safe?'
\par 'Of course.'
\par 'Why're they laughing?'
\par 'They're laughing at themselves. You tricked them, made them jump. This is definitely laughter.'
\par Hesitantly, Beirut moved to Autoga's side, sat down. Autoga stopped grunting, put a hand on Beirut 's shoulder, spoke to his companions. With a millisecond delay, the computer began translating
: 'This god-self-creation is a good Joe, boys. His accent is lousy, but he has a sense of humor.'
\par 'Are you sure of that translation?' Beirut asked.
\par 'Reasonably so,' the computer said. 'Without greater morphological grounding, a cultural investigation in de
pth and series comparisons of vocal evolution, you get only a gross literal approximation, of course. We'll refine it while we go along. We're ready to put your sub-vocals through the lingua pack.'
\par 'Let's talk,' Beirut said.
\par Out of the lingua pack on his chest came a series of sounds approximating 'Ai-ing-eeya.'
\par Computer translation of Autoga's reply was: 'That's a good idea. It's open sky.'
\par Beirut shook his head. It didn't sound right. Open sky?
\par 'Sorry we damaged your vehicle,' Autoga said. 'We thought you were one of our youths playing with danger.'
\par Beirut swallowed. 'You thought my ship ... you people can make ships of this kind?'
\par 'Oh, we made a few about ten million }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 klurch }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 ago,' Autoga said.
\par 'It was at least fifteen million }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 klurch,' }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 said the wrinkle-faced native on Beirut 's left.
\par 'Now, Choon, there you go exaggerating again,' Autoga said. He looked at Beirut . 'You'll have to forgive Chpon. He wants everything to be bigger, better and greater than it is.'
\par 'What's a klurch?' Beirut asked.
\par The computer answered for his ears alone: 'Probable answer -the local year, about one and one-third standards.'
\par 'I'm glad you decided to be peaceful,' Beirut said.
\par The lingua pack rendered this into a variety of sounds and the natives stared at Beirut 's chest.
\par 'He is speaking from his chest,' Choon said.
\par Autoga looked up at the ship. 'There are more of you?'
\par 'Don't answer that,' the computer said. 'Suggest the ship is a source of mystical powers.'
\par Beirut digested this, shook his head. Stupid computer! 'These are sharp cookies,' he said speaking aloud.
\par 'What a delightful arrangement of noises,' Autoga said. 'Do it again.'
\par 'You thought I was one of your youths,' Beirut said. 'Now who do you think I am?'
\par The lingua pack remained silent. His ear speaker said: 'Suggest that question not be asked.'
\par 'Ask it ['Beirut said.
\par A gabble of sound came from the lingua pack.
\par 'We debated that during the presence of s'Chareecha,' Autoga said. 'We hid in the purple darkness, you und
erstand, because we have no wish to seed under the influence of s'Chareecha. A majority among us decided you are the personification of our design for a deity. I dissented. My thought is that you are an unknown, although I grant you temporarily the majori
ty title.'
\par Beirut wet his lips with his tongue.
\par 'He has five fingers,' Choon said.
\par 'This was the argument you used to convince Tura and Lecky,' Autoga said. 'This argument still doesn't answer Spispi's objection .hat the five fingers could be the product of genetic manipulation or that plus amputation.'
\par 'But the eyes,' Choon said. 'Who could conceive of such eyes? Not in our wildest imaginations ... '
\par 'Perhaps you offend our visitor,' Autoga said. He glanced at Beirut , the stalked eyes bending outward quizzically.
\par 'And the articulation of the legs and arms,' one of the other natives ventured.
\par 'You're repeating old arguments, Tura,' Autoga said.
\par 
\par Beirut suddenly had a
 picture of himself as he must appear to these natives. Their eyes had obvious advantages over his. He had seen them look behind themselves without turning their heads. The double thumb arrangement looked useful. They must think one thumb an odd limitatio
n. He began to chuckle.
\par 'What is this noise?' Autoga asked.
\par 'I'm laughing,' Beirut said.
\par 'I will render that: 'I'm laughing at myself,'' the computer said. Sounds issued from the lingua pack.
\par 'A person who can laugh at himself has taken a major step toward the highest civilization,' Autoga said. 'No offense intended.'
\par 'The theories of Picheck that the concerted wish for a deity must produce same are here demonstrated,' Choon said. 'It's not quite the shape of entity I had envisioned, however, but we ... '
\par 'Why don't we inquire?' Autoga asked and turned to Beirut . 'Are you a deity?'
\par 'I'm a mortal human being, nothing more,' Beirut said.
\par The lingua pack remained silent.
\par 'Translate that!' Beirut blared.
\par The computer spoke for him alone: 'The experience, training and memory banks available suggest that it would be safer for you to pose as a deity. Their natural awe would enable you to ... '
\par 'We're not going to fool these characters for five minutes,' Beirut said. 'They've built spaceships. They have advanced elec
tronic techniques. You heard their radio. They've had a civilization for more than twenty-five million years.' He paused. 'Haven't they?'
\par 'Definitely. The cast figure was an advanced form and technique.'
\par 'Then translate my words!'
\par Beirut grew conscious that he had been speaking aloud and the natives were following his words and the movements of his mouth with a rapt intensity.
\par 'Translate,' Autoga said. 'That would be }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 chtsuyop, }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 no?'
\par 'You must speak subvocally,' the computer said. 'They are beginning to break down your language.'
\par 'They're doing it in their heads, you stupid pile of electronic junk,' Beirut said. 'I have to use you! And you think I can pose as a god with these people?'
\par 'I will translate because you command it and my override circuits cannot circumvent your command,' the computer said.
\par 'A computer!' Autoga said. 'He has a translating computer in his vehicle! How quaint.'
\par 'Translate,' Beirut said.
\par Sounds issued from the lingua pack.
\par 'I am vindicated,' Autoga said. 'And you will note that I did it on nothing more than the design of the vehicle and the cut of his clothing, plus the artifacts, of course.'
\par 'This is why you are in command,' Choon said. 'I suffer your correction and instruction abysmally.'
\par Autoga looked at Beirut. 'What will you require-other than the repair of your vehicle?'
\par 'Don't you want to know where I'm from?' Beirut asked.
\par 'You are from somewhere,' Autoga said. 'It has been theorized that other suns and worlds might exist beyond the hydrogen cloud from which we were formed. Your presence suggests this theory is true.'
\par 'But ... but don't you want contact with us ... trade, exchange ideas?'
\par 'It is now apparent,' Autoga said, 'that the empty universe theory has been disproved. However, a primitive such as yourself, even you must realize such interchange would be pointless.'
\par 'But we ... '
\par 'We well know that the enclosure of our universe has forced us in upon ourselves,' Choon said. 'If that's what you were going to say?'
\par 'He was going into boring detail about what he has to offer us,' Autoga said. 'I suggest we get about doing what has to be done. Spispi, you and Tura take care of the computer in his vehicle. Choon and I will ... '
\par 'What're you doing?' Beirut asked. He leaped to his feet. At least, he thought he leaped to his feet, but in a moment he grew conscious that he was still sitting on the ground, the five natives facing him, staring.
\par 'They are erasing some of my circuits!' the computer wailed. 'A magneto-gravitic field encloses me and the ... aroo, tut-tut, jingle bells, jingle bells.'
\par 'This is very interesting,' Autoga said presently. 'He has made contact with a civilization of our level at some previous time. You will note the residual inhibition against lengthy travel away from his home. We'll make the inhibition stronger this time.'

\par Beirut stared at the chattering natives with a sense of deja vu. The speaker in his neck remained silent. His lingua pack made no sound. He felt movement in his mind like spiders crawling along his nerves.
\par 'Who do you suppose he could've contacted?' Choon asked.
\par 'Not one of our groups, of course,' Autoga said. 'Before we stay out in the light of s'Chareecha and plant ourselves for the next seeding, we must start a flow of inquiry.'
\par 'Who will talk to us about such things?' Choon asked. 'We are mere herdsmen.'
\par 'Perhaps we should listen more often to the entertainment broadcasts,' Spispi said. 'Something may have been said.'
\par 'We may be simple herdsmen whose inquiry will not go very far,' Autoga said, 'but this has been an experience to afford us many hours of conversation. Imagine having the empty universe theory refuted!'
\par 
\par Beirut awoke in the control seat of his ship, smelled in the stink of the place his own sweat touched by the chemistry of fear. A glance at the instrument panel showed th
at he had succumbed to the push and turned ship. He was headed back out of the cloud without having found anything in it.
\par An odd sadness came over Beirut.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 I'll find my planet some day, }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 he thought. }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
I'll have alabaster buildings and sheltered waters for sailing and long stretches of prairie for game animals.}{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
\par The automatic log showed turn-around at ninety-four days.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 I stood it longer than Bingaling, }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 he thought.
\par He remembered the conversation with Bingaling then and the curious reference to a previous attempt at the cloud. }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Maybe I did, }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 he thought. }{
\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Maybe I forgot because the push got so tough.}{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
\par Presently, his mind turned to thoughts of Capella Base, of going home. Just the thought of it eased the pressures
 of the push which was still faintly with him. The push ... the push - it had beaten him again. Next trip out, he decided, he'd head the opposite direction, see what was to be found out there.
\par Almost idly then Beirut wondered about the push. }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Why do we call it the push? }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 he wondered. }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Why, don't we call it the pull? }{
\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 The question interested him enough to put it to the computer. 'Tut-tut,' the computer said.

\par 'If you get caught we'll have to throw you to the wolves,' said Dr Fladdis. 'You understand, of course.'
\par Laoconia Wilkinson, senior field agent of the Social Anthropological Service, nodded her narrow head. 'Of course,' she barked. She rustled the travel and order papers in her lap.
\par 'It was very difficult to get High Council approval for this expedition after the ... ah ... unfortunate incident on Monligol,' said Dr Fladdis. 'That's why your operating restrictions are so severe.'
\par 'I'm permitted to take only this -' she glanced at her papers - 'Marie Medill?'
\par 'Well, the basic plan of action was her idea,' said Dr Fladdis. 'And we have no one else in the department with her qualifications in music.'
\par 'I'm not sure I approve of her plan,' muttered Laoconia.
\par 'Ah,' said Dr Fladdis, 'but it goes right to the heart of the situation on Rukuchp, and the beauty of it is that it breaks no law. That's a legal quibble, I agree. But what I mean is you'll be within the letter of the law.'
\par 'And outside its intent,' muttered Laoconia. 'Not that I agree with the law. Still -' she shrugged - 'music!'
\par Dr Fladdis chose to misunderstand. 'Miss Medill has her doctorate in music, yes,' he said. 'A highly educated young woman.'
\par 'If it weren't for the fact that this may be our last oppo
rtunity to discover how those creatures reproduce - ' said Laoconia. She shook her head. 'What we really should be doing is going in there with a full staff, capturing representative specimens, putting them through -'
\par 'You will note the prohibition in Section D of the High Council's mandate,' said Dr Fladdis. ' }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 'The Field Agent may not enclose, restrain or otherwise restrict the freedom of any Rukuchp native.''}{

\par 'Please!' snapped Dr Fladdis.
\par Laoconia stared at him. She had never before seen the Area Director so agitated.

\par 'We cannot be too careful,' said Dr Fladdis. 'With the memory of Monligol still fresh in all minds.' He shuddered. 'We must return to the spirit of the SocAnth motto: }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 'For the Greater Good of the Universe' }{
\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 We've been warned.'
\par 'I don't see how music can be anything but a secondary stimulant,' said Laoconia. 'However, I shall keep an open mind.'
\par 
\par Laoconia Wilkinson looked up from her notes, said: 'Marie, was that a noise outside?' She pushed a strand of gray hair from her forehead.
\par Marie Medill stood at the opposite side of the field hut, staring out one of the two windows. 'I only hear the leaves,' she said. 'They're awfully loud in that wind.'
\par 'You're sure it wasn't Gafka?'
\par Marie sighed and said, 'No, it wasn't his namesong.'
\par 'Stop calling that monster a him!' snapped Laoconia.
\par Marie's shoulders stiffened.
\par Laoconia observed the reflex and thought how wise the Service had been to put a mature, veteran anthropologist in command here. A hex-dome hut was too small
 to confine brittle tempers. And the two women had been confined here for 25 weeks already. Laoconia stared at her companion - such a young romantic, that one.
\par Marie's pose reflected boredom ... worry ...
\par Laoconia glanced around the hut's crowded interior.
 Servo-recorders, night cameras, field computers, mealmech, collapsible floaters, a desk, two chairs, folding bunks, three wall sections taken up by the transceiver linking them with the mother ship circling in satellite orbit overhead. Everything in its 
place and a place for everything.
\par 'Somehow, I just can't help calling Gafka a him,' said Marie. She shrugged. 'I know it's nonsense. }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 Still ... when Gafka sings ... '
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Laoconia studied the younger woman. A blonde girl in a one-piece green uniform; heavy peasant figure, good strong legs, an oval face with high forehead and dreaming blue eyes.
\par 'Speaking of singing,' said Laoconia, 'I don't know what I shall do if Gafka doesn't bring permission for us to attend their Big Sing. We can't solve this mess without the facts.'
\par 'No doubt,' said Marie. She spoke snappishly, trying to keep her attention away from Laoconia. The older woman just sat there. She was always just sitting there - so efficient, so driving, a tall gawk with windburned face, nose too big, mouth too 
big, chin too big, eyes too small.
\par 
\par Marie turned away.
\par 'With every day that passes I'm more convinced that this music thing is a blind alley,' said Laoconia. 'The Rukuchp birthrate keeps going down no matter how much of our music you teach them.'
\par 'But Gafka agrees,' protested Marie. 'Everything points to it. Our discovery of this planet brought the Rukuchps into contact with the first alien music they've ever known. Somehow, that's disrupted their breeding cycle. I'm sure of it.'
\par 'Breeding cycle,' sniffed Laoconia. 'For all we know, these creatures could be ambulatory vegetables without even the most rudimentary ... '
\par 'I'm so worried,' said Marie. 'It's music at the root of the problem, I'm sure, but if it ever got out that we smuggled in those education tapes and taught Gafka all our musical forms ... }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 '
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 'We did }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 not }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
smuggle anything!' barked Laoconia. 'The law is quite clear. It only prohibits any form of mechanical reproducer of actual musical sounds. Our tapes are all completely visual.'
\par 'I keep thinking of Monligol,' said Marie. 'I couldn't live with the knowledge that I'd contributed to the extinction of a sentient species. Even indirectly. If our }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 foreign }{
\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 music really has disrupted ... '
\par 'We don't even know if they breed!'
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 'But Gafka says ... '
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 'Gafka says! A dumb vegetable. Gafka says!'
\par 'Not so dumb,' countered Marie. 'He learned to speak our language in less than three weeks, but }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 we }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 have only the barest rudiments of songspeech.'
\par 'Gafka's an idiot-savant,' said Laoconia. 'And I'm not certain I'd call what that creature does }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 speaking.'}{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
\par 'It is too bad that you're tone deaf,' said Marie sweetly.
\par Laoconia frowned. She leveled a finger at Marie. 'The thing I note is that we only have their word that their birthrate is declining. They called on us for help, and now they obstruct every attempt at field observation.'
\par 'They're so shy,' said Marie.
\par 'They're going to be shy one SocAnth field expedition if they don't invite us to that Big Sing,' said Laoconia. 'Oh! If the Council had only authorized }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 a full }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 fi
eld expedition with armed support!'
\par 'They couldn't!' protested Marie. 'After Monligol, practically every sentient race in the universe is looking on Rukuchp as a final test case. If we mess up another race with our meddling ... '
\par 'Meddling!' barked Laoconia. 'Young woman, the Social Anthropological Service is a holy calling! Erasing ignorance, helping the backward races!'
\par 'And we're the only judges of what's backward,' said Marie. 'How convenient. Now, you take Monligol. Everyone knows that insects carry di
sease. So we move in with our insecticides and kill off the symbiotic partner essential to Monligolian reproduction. How uplifting.'
\par 'They should have told us,' said Laoconia.
\par 'They couldn't,' said Marie. 'It was a social taboo.'
\par 'Well ... ' Laoconia shrugged. 'That doesn't apply here.'
\par 'How do you know?'
\par 'I've had enough of this silly argument,' barked Laoconia. 'See if Gafka's coming. He's overdue.'
\par 
\par Marie inhaled a trembling breath, stamped across to the field hut's lone door and banged it open. Immediately the tinkle of glaze-forest leaves grew louder. The wind brought an odor of peppermint from the stubble plain to her left.
\par She looked across the plain at the orange ball of Almac sinking toward a flat horizon, swung her glance to the right where the wal
l of the glazeforest loomed overhead. Rainbow-streaked batwing leaves clashed in the wind, shifting in subtle competition for the last of the day's orange light.
\par 'Do you see }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 it?' }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 demanded Laoconia.
\par Marie dropped her attention to the foot of the forest wall, where stubble spikes crowded against great glasswood trunks. 'No.'
\par 'What is keeping that creature?'
\par Marie shook her head, setting blonde curls dancing across her uniform collar. 'It'll be dark soon,' she said. 'He said he'd return before it got fully dark.'
\par Laoconia scowled, pushed aside her notes. }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Always calling it a him! They're nothing but animated Easter eggs! If only ... }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
She broke the train of thought, attention caught by a distant sound.
\par 'There!' Marie peered down the length of glazeforest wall.
\par A f
luting passage of melody hung on the air. It was the meister-song of a delicate wind instrument. As they listened, the tones deepened to an organ throb while a section of cello strings held the melody. Glazeforest leaves began to tinkle in sympathetic har
mony. Slowly, the music faded.
\par 'It's Gafka,' whispered Marie. She cleared her throat, spoke louder, self-consciously: 'He's coming out of the forest quite a ways down.'
\par 'I can't tell one from the other,' said Laoconia. 'They all look alike and sound alike. Monsters.'
\par 'They do look alike,' agreed Marie, 'but the sound is quite individual.'
\par 'Let's not harp on my tone deafness!' snapped Laoconia. She joined Marie at the door. 'If they'll only let us attend their Sing ... '
\par A six-foot Easter egg ambled toward them on four of its five prehensile feet.
\par The crystal glistening of its vision cap, tipped slightly toward the field hut, was semi-lidded by inner cloud-pigment in the di
rection of the setting sun. Blue and white greeting colors edged a great bellows muscle around the torso. The bell extension of a mouth/ear - normally visible in a red-yellow body beneath the vision cap - had been retracted to a multi-creased pucker.

\par 'What ugly brutes,' said Laoconia.
\par 'Shhhh!' said Marie. 'You don't know how far away he can hear you.' She waved an arm. 'Gaaafkaa!' Then: 'Damn!'
\par 'What's wrong?'
\par 'I only made eight notes out of his name instead of nine.'
\par Gafka came tip to the door, picking a way through the stubble spikes. The orange mouth/ear extended, sang a 22-note harmonica passage: 'Maarrriee Mmmmmmedillll.' Then a ID-second concerto: 'Laoconnnnia Wiiilkinnnsonnnn.'
\par 'How lovely!' said Marie.
\par 'I wish you'd talk straight out the way we taught you,' said Laoconia. 'That singing is difficult to follow.'
\par 
\par Gafka's vision cap tipped toward her. The voice shifted to a singsong waver: 'But polite sing greeting.'
\par 'Of course,' said Laoconia. 'Now.' She took a deep breath. 'Do we have permission to attend your Big Sing?'
\par Gafka's vision cap tipped toward Marie, back to Laoconia.
\par 'Please, Gafka?' said Marie.
\par 'Difficulty,' wavered Gafka. 'Not know how say. Not have knowledge your kind people. Is subject not want for talking.'
\par 'I see,' said Laoconia, recognizing the metaphorical formula. 'It has to do with your breeding habits.'
\par Gafka's vision cap clouded over with milky pigment, a sign the two women had come to recognize as embarrassment.
\par 'Now, Gafka,' said Laoconia. 'None of that. We've explained about science and professional ethics, the desire to be of real help to one another. You must understand that both Marie and I are here for the good of your people.'
\par A crystal moon unclouded in the part of the vision cap facing Laoconia.
\par 'If we could only get them to speak straight out,' said Laoconia.
\par Marie said: 'Please, Gafka. We only want to help.'
\par 'Understand I,' said Gafka. 'How else talk this I?' More of the vision cap unclouded. 'But must ask question. Friends perhaps not like.'
\par 'We are scientists,' said Laoconia. 'You may ask any question you wish.'
\par 'You are too old for ... breeding?' asked Gafka. Again the vision cap clouded over, sparing Gafka the sight of Laoconia shocked speechless.
\par Marie stepped into the breech. 'Gafka! Your people and my people are ... well, we're just too different. We couldn't. There's no way ... that is ... '
\par 'Impossible!' barked Laoconia. 'Are you implying that we might be sexually attacked if we attended your Big Sing?'
\par Gafka's vision cap unclouded, tipped toward Laoconia. Purple color bands ran up and down the bellows muscle, a sign of confusion.
\par 'Not understand I about sex thing,' said Gafka. 'My people never hurt other creature.' The purple bands slowed their upward-downward chasing, rela
xed into an indecisive green. The vision cap tipped toward Marie. 'Is true all life kinds start egg young same?' This time the clouding of the vision cap was only a momentary glimmerwhite.
\par 'Essentially, that is so,' agreed Laoconia. 'We all }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 do }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 start with a
n egg. However, the fertilization process is different with different peoples.' Aside to Marie, she said: 'Make a note of that point about eggs. It bears out that they may be oviparian as I suspected.' Then: 'Now, I must know what you meant by your questi
on.'
\par Gafka's vision cap rocked left, right, settled on a point between the two women. The sing-song voice intoned: 'Not understand I about different ways. But know I you see many thing my people not see. If breeding (glimmerwhite) different, or you too old 
for breeding (glimmerwhite) my people say you come Big Sing. Not want we make embarrass for you.'
\par 
\par 'We are scientists,' said Laoconia. 'It's quite all right. Now, may we bring our cameras and recording equipment?'
\par 'Bring you much of things?' asked Gafka.
\par 'We'll only be taking one large floater to carry our equipment,' said Laoconia. 'How long must we be prepared to stay?'
\par 'One night,' said Gafka. 'I bring worker friends to help with floater. Go I now. Soon be dark. Come moonrise I return, take to Big Sing p
lace you.' The trumpet mouth fluted three minor notes of farewell, pulled back to an orange pucker. Gafka turned, glided into the forest. Soon he had vanished among reflections of glass-wood boles.
\par 'A break at last!' barked Laoconia. She strode into the hu
t, speaking over her shoulder. 'Call the ship. Have them monitor our equipment. Tell them to get duplicate recordings. While we're starting to analyze the sound-sight record down here they can be transmitting a copy to the master computers at Kampichi. We
 want as many minds on this as possible. We may never get another chance like this one!'
\par Marie said: 'I don't -'
\par 'Snap to it!' barked Laoconia.
\par 'Shall I talk to Dr Baxter?' asked Marie.
\par 'Talk to Helen?' demanded Laoconia. 'Why would you want to bother Helen with a routine question like this?'
\par 'I just want to discuss ... '
\par 'That transceiver is for official use only,' said Laoconia. Transmit the message as I've directed. We're here to solve the Rukuchp breeding problem, not to chit-chat.'
\par 'I feel suddenly so uneasy,' said Marie. 'There's something about this situation that worries me.'
\par 'Uneasy?'
\par 'I think we've missed the point of Gafka's warning.'
\par 'Stop worrying,' said Laoconia. 'The natives won't give us any trouble. Gafka was looking for a last excuse to keep us from attending their Big Sing. You've seen how stupidly shy they are.'
\par 'But what if -'
\par 'I've had a great deal of experience in handling native peoples,' said Laoconia. 'You never have trouble as long as you keep a firm, calm grip on the situation at all times.'
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 'Maybe so. But ... '
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 
'Think of it!' said Laoconia. 'The first humans ever to attend a Rukuchp Big Sing. Unique! You mustn't let the magnitude of our achievement dull your mind. Stay cool and detached as I do. Now get that call off to the ship!'
\par 
\par It was a circular clearing perhaps two kilometers in diameter, dark with moonshadows under the giant glaze trees. High up around the rim of the clearing, moonlight painted prismatic rainbows along every leaf edge. A glint of silver far above the center of
 the open area betrayed the presence of a tiny remote-control floater carrying night cameras and microphones.
\par Except for a space near the forest edge occupied by Laoconia and Marie, the clearing was packed with silent shadowy humps of Rukuchp natives. Vision caps glinted like inverted bowls in the moonlight.
\par Seated on a portable chair beside the big pack-floater, Laoconia adjusted the position of the tiny remote unit high above them. In the monitor screen before her she could see what the floater lenses cove
red - the clearing with its sequin glitter of Rukuchp vision caps and the faintest gleam of red and green instrument lights between herself and Marie seated on the other side of the floater. Marie was monitoring the night lenses that would make the scene 
appear as bright as day on the recording wire.
\par Marie straightened, rubbed the small of her back. 'This clearing must be at least two kilometers across,' she whispered, impressed.
\par Laoconia adjusted her earphones, tested a relay. Her feet ached. It had been at least a four-hour walk in here to this clearing. Sh\'ab
 began to feel latent qualms about what might be ahead in the nine hours left of the Rukuchp night. That stupid warning ...
\par 'I said it's a big clearing,' whispered Marie.
\par Laoconia cast an apprehensive glance at the silent Rukuchp figures packed closely around. 'I didn't realize there'd be so many,' she whispered. 'It doesn't look to me as though they're dying out. What does your monitor screen show?'
\par 'They fill the clearing,' whispered Marie. 'And I think they extend back under the trees. I wish I knew which one was Gafka. I should've watched when he left us.'
\par 'Didn't he say where he was going?'
\par 'He just asked if this spot was all right for us and if we were ready to help them.'
\par 'Well, I'm sure everything's going to be all right,' said Laoconia. She didn't sound very convincing, even to herself.
\par 'Isn't it time to contact the ship?' asked Marie.
\par 'They'll be calling any -' A light flashed red on the panel in front of Laoconia. 'Here they are now.'
\par 
\par She flipped a switch, spoke into her cheek microphone. 'Yes?'
\par The metallic chattering in Laoconia's earphones only made Marie feel more lonely. The ship was so far away above them.
\par 'That's right,' said Laoconia. Transmit your record immediately and ask Kampichi to 
make an independent study. We'll compare notes later.' Silence while she listened, then: 'I'm sure there's no danger. You can keep an eye on us through the overhead lenses. But there's never been a report of a Rukuchp native offering violence to anyone ..
. Well, I don't see what we can do about it now. We're here and that's that. I'm signing off now.' She flipped the switch.
\par 'Was that Dr Baxter?' asked Marie.
\par 'Yes. Helen's monitoring us herself, though I don't see what she can do. Medical people are very peculiar sometimes. Has the situation changed with the natives?'
\par 'They haven't moved that I can see.'
\par 'Why couldn't Gafka have given us a preliminary briefing?' asked Laoconia. 'I detest this flying blind.'
\par 'I think it still embarrasses him to talk about breeding,' said Marie.
\par 'Everything's too quiet,' hissed Laoconia. 'I don't like it.'
\par 'They're sure to do something soon,' whispered Marie.
\par As thou
gh her words were the signal, an almost inaudible vibration began to throb in the clearing. Glaze leaves started their sympathetic tinkle-chiming. The vibration grew, became an organ rumble with abrupt piping obbligato that danced along its edges. A cello
 insertion pulled a melody from the sound, swung it over the clearing while the glazeforest chimed louder and louder.
\par 'How exquisite,' breathed Marie. She forced her attention onto the instruments in front of her. Everything was functioning.
\par The melody brok
e to a single clear high note of harmonic brilliance - a flute sound that shifted to a second phase with expanded orchestration. The music picked up element after element while low-register tympani built a stately rhythm into it, and zither tinkles laid a
 counter-point on the rhythm.
\par 'Pay attention to your instruments,' hissed Laoconia.
\par Marie nodded, swallowing. The music was like a song heard before, but never before played with this perfection. She wanted to close her eyes; she wanted to submit entirely to the ecstasy of sound.
\par Around them, the Rukuchp natives remained stationary, a rhythmic expansion and contraction of bellows muscles their only movement.
\par And the rapture of music intensified.
\par 
\par Marie moved her head from side to side, mouth open. The sound was an infinity of angel choirs - every sublimity of music ever conceived - now concentrated into one exquisite distillation. She felt that it could not possibly grow more beautiful.
\par But it did.
\par There came a lifting-expanding-floating ... a long gliding suspenseful timelessness.
\par Silence.
\par Marie felt herself drifting back to awareness, found her hands limply fumbling with dials. Some element of habit assured her that she had carried out her part of the job, but that music ... }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 She shivered.
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 'They sang for 47 minutes,' hissed Laoconia. She glanced around. 'Now what happens?'
\par Marie rubbed her throat, forced her attention onto the luminous dials, the floater, the clearing. A suspicion was forming in the back of her mind.
\par 'I wish I knew which one of these creatures was Gafka,' whispered Laoconia. 'Do we dare arouse one of them, ask after Gafka?'
\par 'We'd better not,' said Marie.
\par 'These creatures did nothing but sing,' said Laoconia. 'I'm more certain than ever that the music is stimulative and nothing more.'
\par 'I hope you're right,' whispered Marie. Her suspicion was taking on more definite shape ... }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 music, controlled sound, ecstasy of controlled sound ... }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 
Thoughts tumbled over each other }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 in }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid15874516 her mind.
\par }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Time dragged out in silence.
\par 'What do you suppose they're doing?' hissed Laoconia. 'They've been sitting like this for 25 minutes.'
\par Marie glanced around at the ring of Rukuchp natives hemming in the little open space, black mounds topped by dim silver. The stillness was like a charged vacuum.
\par More time passed.
\par 'Forty minutes!' whispered Laoconia. 'Do they expect us to sit here all night?'
\par Marie chewed her lower lip. }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 Ecstasy of sound, }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 she thought. And she thought of sea urchins and the parthenogenetic rabbits of Calibeau.
\par A stirring movement passed through the Rukuchp ranks. Presently, shadowy forms began moving away into the glaze-forest's blackness.
\par 'Where are they going?' hissed Laoconia. 'Do you see Gafka?'
\par 'No.'
\par The transmission-receive light flashed in front of Laoconia. She flippe
d the switch, pressed an earphone against her head. 'They just seem to be leaving,' she whispered into the cheek microphone. 'You see the same thing we do. There's been no movement against us. Let me call you back later. I want to observe this.'
\par A Rukuchp figure came up beside Marie.
\par 'Gafka?' said Marie.
\par 'Gafka,' intoned the figure. The voice sounded sleepy.
\par Laoconia leaned across the instrument-packed floater. 'What are they doing now, Gafka?' she demanded.
\par 'All new song we make from music you give,' said Gafka.
\par 'Is the sing all ended?' asked Marie.
\par 'Same,' breathed Gafka.
\par 'What's this about a new song?' demanded Laoconia.
\par 'Not have your kind song before correct,' said Gafka. 'In it too much new. Not understand we how song make you. But now you teach, make right you.'
\par 'What is all this nonsense?' asked Laoconia. 'Gafka, where are your people all going?'
\par 'Going,' sighed Gafka.
\par Laoconia looked around her. 'But they're departing singly ... or ... well, there don't seem to be any mated pairs. What }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 are }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 they doing?'
\par 'Go each to wait,' said Gafka.
\par And Marie thought of caryocinesis and daughter nuclei.
\par 'I don't understand,' complained Laoconia.
\par 'You teach how new song sing,' sighed Gafka. 'New song best all time. We keep this song. Better much than old song. Make better - ' the women detected the faint glimmer-haze lidding of Gafka's vision cap - 'make better young. Strong more.'
\par 'Gafka,' said Marie, 'is the song all you do? I mean, there isn't anything else?'
\par 'All,' breathed Gafka. 'Best song ever.'
\par Laoconia said: 'I think we'd better follow some of these ... '
\par 'That's not necessary,' said Marie. 'Did you enjoy their music Dr Wilkinson?'
\par 'Well ... ' There appeared to be embarrassment in the way the older woman turned her head away. 'It was }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 very }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 beautiful.'
\par 'And you }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 enjoyed }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 it?' persisted Marie.
\par 'I don't see what ... '
\par 'You're tone deaf,' said Marie.
\par 'It's obviously a stimulant of some sort!' snapped Laoconia. 'I don't understand now why they won't let us ... '
\par 'They let us,' said Marie.
\par 
\par Laoconia turned to Gafka. 'I must insist, Gafka, that we be permitted to study all phases of your breeding process. Otherwise we can be of no help to you.'
\par 'You best help ever,' said Gafka. 'Birthrate all good now. You teach way out from mixing of music.' A shudder passed upward through Gafka's bellows muscles.
\par 'Do you make sense out of this?' demanded Laoconia.
\par 'I'm afraid I do,' said Marie. 'Aren't you tired, Gafka?'
\par 'Same,' sighed Gafka.
\par 'Laoconia, Dr Wilkinson, we'd better get back to the hut,' said Marie. 'We can improvise what we'll need for the Schafter test.'
\par 'But the Schafter's for determining }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 human }{\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 pregnancy!' protested Laoconia.
\par The red light glowed in front of Laoconia. She flipped the switch. 'Yes?'
\par Scratching sounds from the earphones broke the silence. Marie felt that she did not want to hear the voice from the ship.
\par Laoconia said: 'Of course I know you're monitoring the test of ... Why should I tell Marie you've already given Schafter tests to yourself ... ' Laoconia's voice climbed. 'WHAT? Yo
u can't be ser ... That's impossible! But, Helen, we ... they ... you ... we ... Of course! ... Where could we have ... Every woman on the ship ... '
\par There was a long silence while Marie watched Laoconia listening to the earphones, nodding. Presently, Laoc
onia lifted the earphones off her head and put them down gently. Her voice came out listlessly. 'Dr Bax ... Helen suspected that ... she administered Schafter tests to herself and some of the others.'
\par 'She listened to that music?' asked Marie.
\par 'The whole universe listened to that music,' said Laoconia. 'Some smuggler monitored the ship's official transmission of our recordings. Rebroadcast stations took it. Everyone's going crazy about our }{\i\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 beautiful }{
\fs20\insrsid11226386\charrsid14107752 music.'
\par 'Oh. no,' breathed Marie.
\par Laoconia said: 'Everyone
 on the ship listened to our recordings. Helen said she suspected immediately after the broadcast, but she waited the full half hour before giving the Schafter test.' Laoconia glanced at the silent hump of Gafka standing beside Marie. 'Every woman on that
 ship who could become pregnant is pregnant.'
\par 'It's obvious, isn't it?' asked Marie. 'Gafka's people have developed a form of group parthenogenesis. Their Big Sing sets off the blastomeric reaction.'
\par 'But we're humans!' protested Laoconia. 'How can ... '
\par 'A

\par 'Say I to you,' chanted Gafka. There was an air of sadness in the singsong voice. 'Say I to you: all life kinds start egg young same. Not want I to cause troubles. But you say different you.'

\par 'Same.' breathed Gafka. 'Feel pain on eye-top.' Gafka's prehensile legs went into a flurry of digging in the ground beside the floater.

\par Gafka's legs bent, lowered the ovoid body into the freshly dug concavity in the ground. Immediately, the legs began to shrink back into the body. A crack appeared across the vision cap, struck vertically down through the bellows muscles.
\par Presently, there were two Gafkas, each half the size of the original. As the women watched, the two half-sized Gafkas began extruding new legs to regain the normal symmetry.

\par }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
\par 'Better men than you have tried!' snarled Clinton Watt.
\par 'I quote paragraph four, section ninety-one of the Semantic Revision to the Constitution,' said saboteur extraordinary Jorj X. McKie. ''The need for obstructive processes in government having been established as one of the chief safeguards for human right
s, the question of immunities must be defined with extreme precision.''
\par McKie sat across a glistening desk from the Intergalactic Government's Secretary of Sabotage, Clinton Watt. An air of tension filled the green-walled office, carrying over into the scre
en-view behind Watt which showed an expanse of the System Government's compound and people scurrying about their morning business with a sense of urgency.
\par Watt, a small man who appeared to crackle with suppressed energy, passed a hand across his shaven hea
d. 'All right,' he said in a suddenly tired voice. 'This is the only Secretariat of government that's never immune from sabotage. You've satisfied the legalities by quoting the law. Now, do your damnedest!'
\par McKie, whose bulk and fat features usually gave him the appearance of a grandfatherly toad, glowered like a gnome-dragon. His mane of red hair appeared to dance with inner flame.
\par 'Damnedest!' he snapped. 'You think I came in here to try to unseat you? You think that?'
\par And McKie thought: }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 Let's hope he thinks that!}{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
\par 'Stop the act, McKie!' Watt said. 'We both know you're eligible for this chair.' He patted the arm of his chair. 'And we both know the only way you can eliminate me and qualify yourself for the appointment is to overcome me with 
a masterful sabotage. Well, McKie, I've sat here more than eighteen years. Another five months and it'll be a new record. Do your damnedest. I'm waiting.'
\par 'I came in here for only one reason,' McKie said. 'I want to report on the search for saboteur extraordinary Napoleon Bildoon.'
\par McKie sat back wondering: }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 If Watt knew my real purpose here would he act just this way? Perhaps. }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
The man had been behaving oddly since the start of this interview, but it was difficult to determine real motive when dealing with a fellow member of the Bureau of Sabotage.
\par 
\par Cautious interest quickened Watt's bony face. He wet his lips with his tongue and it was obvious he was asking himself if this were more of an elaborate ruse. But McKie had been assigned the task of searching for 
the missing agent, Bildoon, and it was just possible ...
\par 'Have you found him?' Watt asked.
\par I'm not sure,' McKie said. He ran his fingers through his red hair. 'Bildoon's a Pan-Spechi, you know.'
\par 'For disruption's sake!' Watt exploded. 'I know who and what my own agents are! But we take care of our own. And when one of our best people just drops from sight ... What's this about not being sure?'
\par 'The Pan-Spechi are a curious race of creatures,' McKie said. 'Just because they've taken on humanoid shape we tend to forget their five-phase life cycle.'
\par 'Bildoon told me himself he'd hold his group's ego at least another ten years,' Watt said. 'I think he was being truthful, but ... ' Watt shrugged and some of the bursting energy seemed to leave him. 'Well, the grou
p ego's the only place where the Pan-Spechi show vanity, so ... ' Again he shrugged.
\par 'My questioning of the other Pan-Spechi in the Bureau has had to be circumspect, of course,' McKie said. 'But I did follow one lead clear to Achus.'
\par 'And?'
\par McKie brought a white vial from his copious jacket, scattered a metallic powder on the desktop.
\par Watt pushed himself back from the desk, eyeing the powder with suspicion. He took a cautious sniff, smelled chalf, the quick-scribe powder. Still ...
\par 'It's just chalf,' McKie said. And he thought: }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 If he buys that, I may get away with this.}{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
\par 'So scribe it,' Watt said.
\par Concealing his elation, McKie held a chalf-memory stick over the dusted surface. A broken circle with arrows pointing to a right-hand flow appeared in the chalf. At}{\f793\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
 each break in the circle stood a symbol - in one place the Pan-Spechi character for ego, then the delta for fifth gender and, finally, the three lines that signified the dormant cr\'e8che-triplets.
\par }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 McKie pointed to the fifth gender delta. 'I've seen a Pan-Spechi in this position who looks a bit like Bildoon and }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 appears }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
to have some of his mannerisms. There's no identity response from the creature, of course. Well, you know how the quasi-feminine fifth gender reacts.'
\par 'Don't ever let that amorous attitude fool}{\f793\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752  you,' Watt warned. 'In spite of your nasty disposition I wouldn't want to lose you into  a Pan-Spechi cr\'e8che.'
\par }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 'Bildoon wouldn't rob a fellow agent's identity,' McKie said. He pulled at his lower lip, feeling an abrupt uncertainty. Here, of course, was the most touchy part of the whole scheme. 'If it was Bildoon.'
\par 'Did you meet this group's ego holder?' Watt asked and his voice betrayed real interest.
\par 'No,' McKie said. 'But I think the ego-single of this Pan-Spechi is involved with the Tax Watchers.'
\par McKie waited, wondering if Watt would rise to the bait.
\par 'I've never heard of an ego change being forced onto a Pan-Spechi,' Watt said in a musing tone, 'but that doesn't mean it's impossible. If those Tax Watcher do gooders found Bildoon sabotaging their efforts and ... Hmmm.'
\par 'Then Bildoon was after the Tax Watchers,' McKie said.
\par 
\par Watt scowled. McKie's question was in extreme bad taste. Senior agents, unless joined on a project or where the information was volunteered, didn't snoop openly into the work of 
their fellows. Left hand and right hand remained mutually ignorant in the Bureau of Sabotage and for good reason. Unless ... Watt stared speculatively at his saboteur extraordinary.
\par McKie shrugged as Watt remained silent. 'I can't operate on inadequate information,' he said. 'I must, therefore, resign the assignment to search for Bildoon. Instead, I will now look into the Tax Watchers.'
\par 'You will not!' Watt snapped.
\par McKie forced himself not to look at the design he had drawn on the desktop. The next few moments were the critical ones.
\par 'You'd better have a legal reason for that refusal,' McKie said.
\par Watt swiveled sideways in his chair, glanced at the screenview, then addressed himself to the side wall. 'The situation has become one of extreme delicacy, Jorj. It's well known that you're one of our finest saboteurs.'
\par 'Save your oil for someone who needs it,' McKie growled.
\par 'Then I'll put it this way,' Watt said, returning his gaze to McKie. 'The Tax Watchers in the last few days have posed a real threat to the B
ureau. They've managed to convince a High Court magistrate they deserve the same immunity from our ministrations that a ... well, public water works or ... ah ... food processing plant might enjoy. The magistrate, Judge Edwin Dooley, invoked the Public Sa
fety amendment. Our hands are tied. The slightest suspicion that we've disobeyed the injunction and ... '
\par Watt drew a finger across his throat.
\par 'Then I quit,' McKie said.
\par 'You'll do nothing of the kind!'
\par 'This TW outfit is trying to eliminate the Bureau, isn't it?' McKie asked. 'I remember the oath I took just as well as you do.'
\par 'Jorj, you couldn't be that much of a simpleton,' Watt said. 'You quit, thinking that absolves the Bureau from responsibility for you! That trick's as old as time!'
\par 'Then fire me!' McKie said.
\par 'I've no legal reason to fire you Jorj.'
\par 'Refusal to obey orders of a superior,' McKie said.
\par 'It wouldn't fool anybody, you dolt!'
\par McKie appeared to hesitate, said: 'Well, the public doesn't know the inner machinery of how we change the Bureau's command. Perhaps it's time we opened up.'
\par 'Jorj, before I could fire you there'd have to be a reason so convincing that ... Just forget it.'
\par 
\par McKie's eyes lifted until the eyes wer
e mere slits. The crucial few moments had arrived. He had managed to smuggle a Jicuzzi stim into this office past all of Watt's detectors, concealing the thing's detectable radiation core within an imitation of the lapel badge that Bureau agents wore.

\par 'In Lieu of Red Tape,' McKie said and touched the badge with a finger, feeling the raised letters there - 'ILRT.' The touch focused the radiation core onto the metallic dust scattered over the desktop.
\par Watt gripped the arms of the chair, studying McKie with a new look of wary tension.
\par 'We are under legal injunction to keep hands off the Tax Watchers,' Watt said. 'Anything that happens to those people or to their project for scuttling us - even legitimate accidents - will be laid at our door-. We must be able to
 defend ourselves. No one who has ever been connected with us dares fall under the slightest suspicion of complicity.'
\par 'How about a floor waxed to dangerous slickness in the path of one of their messengers? How about a doorlock changed to delay -'
\par 'Nothing.'
\par McKie stared at his chief. Everything depended now on the man holding very still. He knew Watt wore detectors to warn him of concentrated beams of radiation. But this Jicuzzi stim had been rigged to diffuse its charge off the metallic dust on the desk a
nd that required several seconds of relative quiet.
\par The men held themselves rigid in the staredown until Watt began to wonder at the extreme stillness of McKie's body. The man was even holding his breath!
\par McKie took a deep breath, stood up.
\par 'I warn you, Jorj,' Watt said.
\par 'Warn me?'
\par 'I can restrain you by physical means if necessary.'
\par 'Clint, old enemy, save your breath. What's done is done.'
\par A smile touched McKie's wide mouth. He turned, crossed to  the room's only door, paused there, hand on knob.
\par 'What have you done?' Watt exploded.
\par McKie continued to look at him.
\par Watt's scalp began itching madly. He put a hand there, felt a long tangle of ... tendrils! They were lengthening under his fingers, growing out of his scalp, waving and writhing.
\par 'A Jicuzzi stim,' Watt breathed.
\par McKie let himself out, closed the door.
\par Watt leaped out of his chair, raced to the door.
\par Locked!
\par He knew McKie and didn't try unlocking it. Frantically, Watt slapped a molecular dispersion wad against the door, dived through as the wad blasted. He landed in the outer hall, stared first one direction, then the other.
\par The hall was empty.
\par 
\par Watt sighed. The tendrils had stopped growing, but they were long enough now that he could see them writhing past his eyes - a rainbow mass of wrigglers, pa
rt of himself. And McKie with the original stim was the only one who could reverse the process-unless Watt were willing to spend an interminable time with the Jicuzzi themselves. No. That was out of the question.
\par Watt began assessing his position.
\par The stim
 tendrils couldn't be removed surgically, couldn't be tied down or contained in any kind of disguise without endangering the person afflicted with them. Their presence would hamper him, too, during this critical time of trouble with the Tax Watchers. How 
could he appear in conferences and interviews with these things writhing in their Medusa dance on his head? It would be laughable! He'd be an object of comedy.
\par And if McKie could stay out of the way until a Case of Exchangement was brought before the full C
abinet ... But, no! Watt shook his head. This wasn't the kind of sabotage that required a change of command in the Bureau. This was a gross thing. No subtlety to it. This was like a practical joke. Clownish.
\par But McKie was noted for his clownish attitude, his irreverence for all the blundering self-importance of government.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 Have I been self-important? }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 Watt wondered.
\par In all honesty, he had to admit it.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 I'll have to submit my resignation today, }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 he thought. }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 Right after I fire McKie. One look at me and there'll 
be no doubt of why I did it. This is about as convincing a reason as you could find.}{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
\par Watt turned to his right, headed for the lab to see if they could help him bring this wriggling mass under control.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 The President will want me to stay at the helm until McKie makes his next move, }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 Watt thought. }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752

\par }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
\par McKie waited in the living room of the Achusian mansion with ill concealed unease. Achus was the administrative planet for the Vulpecula region, an area of great w
ealth, and this room high on a mountaintop commanded a natural view to the southwest across lesser peaks and foothills misted in purple by a westering G}{\fs20\sub\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 3}{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752  sun.
\par But McKie ignored the view, trying to watch all corners of the room at once. He had seen a fifth }{\f793\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 gender Pan-Spechi here in company with the fourth-gender ego-holder. That could only mean the cr\'e8
che with its three dormants was nearby. By all accounts, this was a dangerous place for someone not protected by bonds of friendship and community of interest.}{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
\par The value of the Pan-Spechi to the universal human society in which they participated was beyond question. What other species had such refined finesse in deciding when to hinder and when to help? Who else could send a key member of its group into circumst
ances of extreme peril without fear that the endangered one's knowledge would be lost?
\par There was always a dormant to take up where the lost one had left off.
\par Still, the Pan-Spechi did have their idiosyncrasies. And their hungers were at times bizarre.
\par 'Ahh, McKie.'
\par }{\f793\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 The voice, deep and masculine, came from his left. McKie whirled to study the figure that came through a door carved from a single artificial emerald of glittering cr\'e8me de menthe colors.
\par }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 The speaker was humanoid but with Pan-Spechi multi-faceted
 eyes. He appeared to be a terranic man (except for the blue-green eyes) of an indeterminate, well-preserved middle age. The body suggested a certain daintiness in its yellow tights and singlet. The head was squared in outline with close-cropped blond hai
r, a fleshy chunk of nose and thick splash of mouth.
\par 'Panthor Bolin here,' the Pan-Spechi said. 'You are welcome in my home, Jorj McKie.'
\par McKie relaxed slightly. Pan-Spechi were noted for honoring hospitality once it was extended ... provided the guest didn't violate their mores.
\par 'I'm honored that you've agreed to see me,' McKie said.
\par 'The honor is mine,' Bolin said. 'We've long recognized you as a person whose understanding of the Pan-Spechi is most subtle and penetrating. I've longed for the chance to have
 uninhibited conversation with you. And here you are.' He indicated a chair-dog against the wall to his right, snapped his fingers. The semi-sentient artifact glided to a position behind McKie. 'Please be seated.'
\par McKie, his caution re-alerted by Bolin's reference to 'uninhibited conversation,' sank into the chairdog, patting it until it  assumed the contours he wanted.
\par Bolin took a chairdog facing him, leaving only about a meter separating their knees.
\par 
\par 'Have your egos shared nearness before?' McKie asked. 'You appeared to recognize me.'
\par 'Recognition goes deeper than ego,' Bolin said. 'Do you wish to join identities and explore this question?'
\par McKie wet his lips with his tongue. This was delicate ground with the Pan-Spechi, whose one ego moved somehow from member to member of the unit group as they traversed their }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 circle of being.}{
\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
\par 'I ... ah ... not at this time,' McKie said.
\par 'Well spoken,' Bolin said. 'Should you ever change your mind, my ego-group would consider it a most signal honor. Yours is a strong identity, one we respect.'
\par 'I'm ... most honored,' McKie said. He rubbed nervously at his jaw, recognizing the dangers in this conversation. Each Pan-Spechi group maintained a supremely jealous attitude of and about its wandering ego. The ego imbued the hol
der of it with a touchy sense of honor. Inquiries about it could be carried out only through such formula questions as McKie already had asked.
\par Still, if this were a member of the pentarchal life circle containing the missing saboteur extraordinary Napoleon Bildoon ... if it were, much would be explained.
\par 'You're wondering if we really can communicate,' Bolin said. McKie nodded.
\par 'The concept }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 of humanity,' }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 Bolin said,' - our term for it would translate approximately as }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 com-sentiency - }{
\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 has been extended to en
compass many different shapes, life systems and methods of mentation. And yet we have never been sure about this question. It's one of the major reasons many of us have adopted your life-shape and much of your metabolism. We wished to experience your stre
ngths and your weaknesses. This helps ... but is not an absolute solution.'
\par 'Weaknesses?' McKie asked, suddenly wary.
\par 'Ahhh-hummm,' Bolin said. 'I see. To allay your suspicions I will have translated for you soon one of our major works. One of the strongest
 sympathetic bonds we have with your species, for example, is the fact that we both originated as extremely vulnerable surface-bound creatures whose most sophisticated defense came to be the social structure.'
\par 'I'll be most interested to see the translation,' McKie said.
\par 'Do you wish more amenities or do you care to state your business now?' Bolin asked.
\par 'I was ... ah ... assigned to seek out a missing agent of our Bureau,' McKie said, 'to be certain no harm had befallen this ... ah ... agent.'
\par 'Your avoida
nce of gender is most refined,' Bolin said. 'I appreciate the delicacy of your position and your good taste. I will say this for now: the Pan-Spechi you seek is not at this time in need of your assistance. Your concern, however, is appreciated. It will be
 communicated to those upon whom it will have the most influence.'
\par 'That's a great relief to me,' McKie said. And he wondered: }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 What did he really mean by that? }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
This thought elicited another, and McKie said: 'Whenever I run into this problem of communication between species I'm reminded of an old culture/teaching story.'
\par 'Oh?' Bolin registered polite curiosity.
\par 'Two practitioners of the art of mental healing, so the story goes, passed each other every morning on their way to their respective offices. They kne
w each other, but weren't on intimate terms. One morning as they approached each other, one of them turned to the other and said, 'Good morning.' The one greeted failed to respond, but continued toward his office. Presently, though he stopped, turned and 
stared at the retreating back of the man who'd spoken, musing to himself: 'Now, what did he really mean by that?''
\par 
\par Bolin began to chuckle, then laugh. His laughter grew louder and louder until he was holding his sides.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 It wasn't that funny, }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 McKie thought.
\par Bolin's laughter subsided. 'A very educational story,' he said. 'I'm deeply indebted to you. This story shows your awareness of how important it is in communication that we be aware of the other's identity.'
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 Does it? }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 McKie wondered. }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 How's that?}{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
\par And McKie f
ound himself caught up by his knowledge of how the Pan-Spechi could pass a single ego-identity from individual to individual within the life circle group of five distinct protoplasmic units. He wondered how it felt when the ego-holder gave up the identity
 }{\f793\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 to become the fifth gender, passing the ego spark to a newly matured unit from the cr\'e8che. Did the fifth gender willingly become cr\'e8
che nurse and give itself up as a mysterious identity-food for the three dormants in the cr\'e8che? he wondered.
\par }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 'I heard about what you did to Secretary of Sabotage Clinton Watt,' Bolin said. 'The story of your dismissal from the service preceded you here.'
\par 'Yes,' McKie said. 'That's why I'm here, too.'
\par 'You've penetrated to the fact that our Pan-Spechi community he
re on Achus is the heart of the Tax Watchers' organization,' Bolin said. 'It was very brave of you to walk right into our hands. I understand how much more courage it takes for your kind to face unit extinction than it does for our kind. Admirable! You ar
e indeed a prize.'
\par McKie fought down a sensation of panic, reminding himself that the records he had left in his private locker of Bureau headquarters could be deciphered in time even if he did not return.
\par 'Yes,' Bolin said, 'you wish to satisfy yourself that the ascension of a Pan-Spechi to the head of your Bureau will pose no threat to other human species. This is understandable.'
\par McKie shook his head to clear it. 'Do you read minds?' he demanded.
\par 'Telepathy is not one of our accomplishments,' Bolin said, his voice heavy with menace. 'I do hope that was a generalized question and in no way directed at the intimacies of my ego-group.'
\par 'I felt that you were reading my mind,' McKie said, tensing himself for defense.
\par 
\par 'That was how I interpreted the question,' Bolin said. 'Forgive my question. I should not have doubted your delicacy or your tact.'
\par 'You do hope to place a member in the job of Bureau Secretary, though?' McKie said.
\par 'Remarkable that you should've suspected it,' Bolin said. 'How can you be sure our intention is not merely to destroy the Bureau?'
\par 'I'm not.' McKie glanced around the room, regretting that he had been forced to act alone.
\par 'Where did we give ourselves away?' Bolin mused.
\par 'Let me remind you,' McKie said, 'that I have accepted the hospitality you offered and that I've not offended your mores.'
\par 'Most remarkable,' Bolin said. 'In spite of all the temptations I offered, you have not offended our mores. This is true. You are an embarrassment, indeed you are. But perhaps you have a weapon. Yes?'
\par McKie lifted a wavering }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 shape }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 from an inner pocket.
\par 'Ahhh, the Jicuzzi stim,' Bolin said. 'Now, let me see, is that a weapon?'
\par McKie held the }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 shape }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 on his palm. It appeared flat at first, like a palm-sized sheet of pink paper. Gradually, the flatness grew 
a superimposed image of a tube laid on its surface, then another image of an S-curved spring that coiled and wound around the tube.
\par 'Our species can control its shape to some extent,' Bolin said. 'There's some question on whether I can consider this a weapon.'
\par McKie curled his fingers around the }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 shape, }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 squeezed. There came a pop, and fumaroles of purple light emerged between his fingers accompanied by an odor of burnt sugar.

\par 'Exit stim,' McKie said. 'Now I'm completely defenseless, entirely dependent upon your hospitality.'
\par 'Ah, you are a tricky one,' Bolin said. 'But have you no regard for Ser Clinton Watt? To him, the change you forced upon him is an affliction. You've destroyed the instrument that might have reversed the process.'
\par 'He can apply to the Jicuzzi,' McKie said, wondering why Bolin should concern himself over Watt.
\par 'Ah, but they will ask your permission to intervene,' Bolin said. 'They are so formal. Drafting their request should take at least three standard years. They will not take the slighte
st chance of offending you. And you, of course, cannot volunteer your permission without offending them. You know, they may even build a nerve-image of you upon which to test their petition. You are not a callous person, McKie, in spite of your clownish p
oses. I'd not realized how important this confrontation was to you.'
\par 
\par 'Since I'm completely at your mercy,' McKie said, 'would you try to stop me from leaving here?'
\par 'An interesting question,' Bolin said. 'You have information I don't want revealed at this time. You're aware of this, naturally?'
\par 'Naturally.'
\par 'I find the constitution a most wonderful document,' Bolin said. 'The profound awareness of the individual's ide
ntity and its relationship to society as a whole. Of particular interest is the portion dealing with the Bureau of Sabotage, those amendments recognizing that the Bureau itself might at times need ... ah ... adjustment.'
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 Now what's he driving at? }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 McKie wondered. And he noted how Bolin squinted his eyes in thought, leaving only a thin line of faceted glitter.
\par 'I shall speak now as chief officer of the Tax Watchers,' Bolin said, 'reminding you that we are legally immune from sabotage.'
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 I've found out what I wanted to know, }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 McKie thought. Now if I can only get out of here with }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 it!}{
\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
\par 'Let us consider the training of saboteurs extraordinary,' Bolin said. 'What do the trainees learn about the make-work and feather-bedding elements in Bureau activity'
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 He's not going to trap me in a lie, }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
McKie thought. 'We come right out and tell our trainees that one of our chief functions is to create jobs for the politicians to fill,' he said. 'The more hands in the pie, the slower the mixing.'
\par 'You've heard that telling a falsehood to your host is a great breach of Pan-Spechi mores, I see,' Bolin said. 'You understand, of course, that refusal to answer certain questions is interpreted as a falsehood?'
\par 'So I've been told,' McKie said.
\par 'Wonderful! And what are your trainees told about the foot dragging and the monkeywrenches you throw into the path of legislation?'
\par 'I quote from the pertinent training brochure,' McKie said. ''A major function of the Bureau is to slow passage of legislation.''
\par 'Magnificent! And what about the disputes and outright battles  Bureau agents have been known to incite?'
\par 'Strictly routine,' McKie said. 'We're duty bound to encourage the growth of anger in government wherever we can. It exposes the temperamental types, the ones who can't control themselves, who can't think on their feet.'
\par 'Ah,' Bolin said. 'How entertaining.'
\par 'We keep entertainment value in mind,' McKie admitted. 'We use drama and flamboyance wherever possible to keep our activities fascinating to the public.'
\par 'Flamboyant obstructionism,' Bolin mused.
\par 'Obstruction is a factor in strength,' McKie said. 'Only the strongest surmount the obstructions to succeed in government. The strongest ... or the most devious, which is more or less the same thing when it comes to government.'
\par 
\par 'How illuminating,' Bolin said. He rubbed the backs of his hands, a Pan-Spechi mannerism denoting satisfaction. 'Do you have special instructions regarding political parties?'
\par 'We stir up dissent between them,' McKie said. 'Opposition tends to expose reality, that's one of our axioms.'
\par 'Would you characterize Bureau agents as troublemakers?'
\par 'Of course! My parents were happy as the devil when I showed troublemaking tendencies at an early age. They knew there'd be a lucrative outlet for this when I grew up. They saw to it that 
I was channeled in the right directions all through school - special classes in Applied Destruction, Advanced Irritation, Anger I and II ... only the best teachers.'
\par 'You're suggesting the Bureau's an outlet for society's regular crop of 'troublemakers?''
\par 'Isn't that obvious? And troublemakers naturally call for the services of troubleshooters. That's an outlet for do-gooders. You've a check and balance system serving society.'
\par McKie waited, watching the Pan-Spechi, wondering if his answers had gone far enough.
\par 'I speak as a Tax Watcher, you understand?' Bolin asked.
\par 'I understand.'
\par The public pays for this Bureau. In essence, the public is paying people to cause trouble.'
\par 'Isn't that what we do when we hire police, tax investigators and the like?' McKie asked.
\par A look of gloating satisfaction came over Bolin's face. 'But these agencies operate for the greater good of humanity!' he said.
\par 'Before he begins training,' McKie said, and
 his voice took on a solemn, lecturing tone, 'the potential saboteur is shown the entire sordid record of history. The do-gooders succeeded once ... long ago. They eliminated virtually all red tape from government. This great machine with its power over h
u
man lives slipped into high speed. It moved faster and faster.' McKie's voice grew  louder. 'Laws were conceived and passed in the same hour! Appropriations came and were gone in a fortnight. New bureaus flashed into existence for the most insubstantial r
easons.'
\par McKie took a deep breath, realizing he'd put sincere emotional weight behind his words.
\par 'Fascinating,' Bolin said. 'Efficient government, eh?'
\par 'Efficient?' McKie's voice was filled with outrage. 'It was like a great wheel thrown suddenly out of bal
ance! The whole structure of government was in imminent danger of fragmenting before a handful of people, wise with hindsight, used measures of desperation and started what was called the Sabotage Corps.'
\par 'Ahhh, yes, I've heard about the Corps' violence.'
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 He's needling me, }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
McKie thought, but found that honest anger helped now. 'All right, there was bloodshed and terrible destruction at the beginning,' he said. 'But the big wheels were slowed. Government developed a controllable speed.'
\par 'Sabotage,' Bolin sneered. 'In lieu of red tape.'
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 I needed that reminder, }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 McKie thought.
\par 'No task too small for Sabotage, no task too large,' McKie said. 'We keep the wheel turning slowly and smoothly. Some anonymous Corpsman put it into words a long time ago: 'When in doubt, delay the big ones and speed the little ones.''
\par 
\par 'Would you say the Tax Watchers were a 'big one' or a 'little one'?' Bolin asked, his voice mild.
\par 'Big one,' McKie said and waited for Bolin to pounce.
\par But the Pan-Spechi appeared amused. 'An unhappy answer.'
\par 'As it says in the Constitution,' McKie said. ''The pursuit of unhappiness is an inalienable right of all humans.''
\par 'Trouble is as trouble does,' Bolin said and clapped his hands.
\par }{\f793\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 Two Pan-Spechi in the uniforms of system police came through the cr\'e8me de }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 menthe emerald door.
\par 'You heard?' Bolin asked.
\par 'We heard,' one of the police said.
\par 'Was he defending his bureau?' Bolin asked.
\par 'He was,' the policeman said.
\par 'You've seen the court order,' Bolin said. 'It pains me because Ser McKie accepted the hospitality of my house, but he must be held incommunicado until he's needed in court. He's to be treated kindly, you understand?'
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 Is he really bent on destroying the Bureau? }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 McKie asked himself in sudden consternation. }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 Do I have it figured wrong?}{
\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
\par 'You contend my words were sabotage?' McKie asked.
\par 'Clearly an attempt to sway the chief officer of the Tax Watchers from his avowed duties,' Bolin said. He stood, bowed.
\par McKie 
lifted himself out of the chairdog, assumed an air of confidence he did not feel. He clasped his thick-fingered hands together and bowed low, a grandfather toad rising from the deep  to give his benediction. 'In the words of the ancient proverb,' he said,
 ''The righteous man lives deep within a cavern and the sky appears to him as nothing but a small round hole.''
\par Wrapping himself in dignity, McKie allowed the police to escort him from the room.
\par Behind him, Bolin gave voice to puzzlement: 'Now, what did he mean by that?'

\par }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
\par 'Hear ye! Hear ye! System High Court, First Bench, Central Sector, is now in session!'
\par The robo-clerk darted back and forth across the cleared lift dais of the courtarena, its metal curves glittering in the morning light that
 poured down through the domed weather cover. Its voice, designed to fit precisely into the great circular room, penetrated to the farthest walls: 'All persons having petitions before this court draw near!'
\par The silvery half globe carrying First Magistrate 
Edwin Dooley glided through an aperture behind the lift dais and was raised to an appropriate height. His white sword of justice lay diagonally across the bench in front of him. Dooley himself sat in dignified silence while the robo-clerk finished its ste
ntorian announcement and rolled to a stop just beyond the lift field.
\par Judge Dooley was a tall, black browed man who affected the ancient look with ebon robes over white linen. He was noted for decisions of classic penetration.
\par He sat now with his face held 
in rigid immobility to conceal his anger and disquiet. Why had they put him in this hot spot? Because he'd granted the Tax Watchers' injunction? No matter how he ruled now, the result likely would be uproar. Even President Bindley was watching this one th
rough one of the hot-line projectors.
\par The President had called shortly before this session. It had been Phil and Ed all through the conversation, but the intent remained clear. The Administration was concerned about this case. Vital legislation pended; vote
s were needed. Neither the budget nor the Bureau of Sabotage had entered their conversation, but the President had made his point - }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
don't compromise the Bureau but save that Tax Watcher support for the Administration!}{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
\par 'Clerk, the roster,' Judge Dooley said.
\par And he thought: }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 They'll get judgment according to strict interpretation of the law! Let them argue with that!}{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
\par The robo-clerk's reelslate buzzed. Words appeared on the repeater in front of the judge as the clerk's voice announced: 'The People versus Clifton Watt, Jorj X. McKie and the Bureau of Sabotage.'
\par Dooley looked down into the courtarena, noting the group seated at the black oblong table in the Defense ring on his left: a sour-faced Watt with his rainbow horror of Medusa head, McKie's fat features co
mposed in the look of someone trying not to snicker at a sly joke - the two defendants flanking their attorney, Pander Oulson, the Bureau of Sabotage's chief counsel. Oulson was a great thug of a figure in defense white with glistening eyes under beetle b
rows and a face fashioned mostly of scars.
\par At the Prosecution table on the right sat Prosecutor Holjance Vohnbrook, a tall scarecrow of a man dressed in conviction red. Gray hair topped a stern face as grim and forbidding as a latter day Cotton Mather. Besi
de him sat a frightened appearing young aide and Panthor Bolin, the Pan-Spechi complainant, his multi-faceted eyes hidden beneath veined lids.
\par 'Are we joined for trial?' Dooley asked.
\par Both Oulson and Vohnbrook arose, nodded.
\par 'If the court pleases,' Vohnbrook rumbled, 'I would like to remind the Bureau of Sabotage personnel present that this court is exempt from their ministrations.'
\par 'If the prosecutor trips over his own feet,' Oulson said, 'I assure him it will be his own clumsiness and no act of mine nor of my colleagues.'
\par Vohnbrook's face darkened with a rush of blood. 'It's well known how you ... '
\par 
\par A great drumming boomed through 
the courtarena as Dooley touched the handle of his sword of office. The sound drowned the prosecutor's words. When silence was restored, Dooley said: 'This court will tolerate no displays of personality. I wish that understood at the outset.'
\par Oulson smiled, a look like a grimace in his scarred face. 'I apologize, Your Honor,' he said.
\par Dooley sank back into his chair, noting the gleam in Oulson's eyes. It occurred to Dooley then that the defense attorney, sabotage-trained, could have brought on the prosecutor's attack to gain the court's sympathy.
\par The charge is outlaw sabotage in violation of this court's injunction,' Dooley said. 'I understand that opening statements have been waived by both sides, the public having been admitted to causae in this matter by appropriate postings?'
\par 'So recorded,' intoned the robo-clerk.
\par Oulson leaned forward against the defense table, said: 'Your Honor, defendant Jorj X. McKie has not accepted me as counsel and wishes to argue for separate trial. I am here now representing only the Bureau and Clinton Watt.'
\par 'Who is appearing for defendant McKie?' the judge asked.
\par McKie, feeling like a man leaping over a precipice, got to his feet, said: 'I wish to represent myself, Your Honor.'
\par 'You should be cautioned against this course,' Dooley said.
\par 'Set Oulson has advised me I have a fool for a client,' McKie said. 'But in common with most Bureau agents, I have legal training. I've been admitted to the System Bar and have practiced under such codes as the Gowachin where the double-negative i
nnocence requirement must be satisfied before bringing criminal accusation against the prosecutor and proceeding backward the premise that ... '
\par 'This is not Gowachin,' Judge Dooley said.
\par 'May I remind the Court,' Vohnbrook said, 'that defendant McKie is a saboteur extraordinary. This goes beyond questions of champerty. Every utterance this man ... '
\par 'The law's the same for official saboteurs as it is for others in respect to the issue at hand,' Oulson said.
\par 'Gentlemen!' the judge said. 'If you please? I will decide law in this court.' He waited through a long moment of silence. 'The behavior of all parties in this matter is receiving my most careful attention.'
\par McKie forced himself to radiate calm good humor.
\par 
\par Watt, whose profound knowledge of the saboteur extraordinary made this pose a danger signal, tugged violently at the sleeve of defense attorney Oulson. Oulson waved him away. Watt glowered at McKie.
\par 'If the court permits,' McKie said, 'a joint defense on the present charge would appear to violate ... '
\par 'The court is well aware that this case was bound over on the basis of deposa summation through a ruling by a robo-legum,' Dooley said. 'I warn both defense and prosecution, however, that I make my own decisions in such matters. Law and robo-legum are bot
h human constructions and require human interpretation. And I will add that, as far as I'm concerned, in all conflicts between human agencies and machine agencies the human agencies are paramount.'
\par 'Is this a hearing or a trial?' McKie asked.
\par 'We will proceed as in trial, subject to the evidence as presented.'
\par McKie rested his palms on the edge of the defense table, studying the judge. The saboteur felt a surge of misgiving. Dooley was a no-nonsense customer. He had left himself a wide avenue within the ind
ictment. And this was a case that went far beyond immediate danger to the Bureau of Sabotage. Far-reaching precedents could be set here this day - or disaster could strike. Ignoring instincts of self preservation, McKie wondered if he dared try sabotage w
ithin the confines of the court.
\par 'The robo-legum indictment requires joint defense,' McKie said. 'I admit sabotage against Ser Clinton Watt, but remind the court of Paragraph Four, section ninety-one, of the Semantic Revision to the Constitution, wherein th
e Secretary of Sabotage is  exempted from all immunities. I move to quash the indictment as it regards myself. I was at the time a legal officer of the Bureau required by my duties to test the abilities of my superior.'
\par Vohnbrook scowled at McKie.
\par 'Mmmm,' Dooley said. He saw that the prosecutor had detected where McKie's logic must lead. If McKie were legally dismissed from the Bureau at the time of his conversation with the Pan-Spechi, the prosecution's case might fall through.
\par 'Does the prosecutor wish to seek a conspiracy indictment?' Dooley asked.
\par For the first time since entering the courtarena, defense attorney Oulson appeared agitated. He bent his scarred features close to Watt's gorgon head, conferred in whispers with the defendant. Oulson's 
face grew darker and darker as he whispered. Watt's gorgon tendrils writhed in agitation.
\par 'We don't seek a conspiracy indictment at this time,' Vohnbrook said. 'However, we would be willing to separate ... '
\par 'Your Honor!' Oulson said, surging to his feet. 'Defense must protest separation of indictments at this time. It's our contention that \'85 '
\par 'Court cautions both counsel in this matter that this is not a Gowachin jurisdiction,' Dooley said in an angry voice. 'We don't have to convict the defender and exon
erate the prosecutor before trying a case. However, if either of you would wish a change of venue ... '
\par Vohnbrook, a smug expression on his lean face, bowed to the judge. 'Your Honor,' he said, 'we wish at this time to request removal of defendant McKie from the indictment and ask that he be held as a prosecution witness.'
\par 
\par 'Objection!' Oulson shouted. 'Prosecution well knows it cannot hold a key witness under trumped up ... '
\par 'Overruled,' Dooley said.
\par 'Exception!'
\par 'Noted.'
\par Dooley waited as Oulson sank into
 his chair. This is a day to remember, the judge thought. Sabotage itself outfoxed! Then he noted the glint of sly humor in the eyes of saboteur extraordinary McKie, realizing with an abrupt sense of caution that McKie too had manoeuvered for this positio
n.
\par 'Prosecution may call its first witness,' the judge said, and he punched a code signal that sent a robo-aide to escort McKie away from the defense table and into a holding box.
\par A look of almost pleasure came over prosecutor Vohnbrook's cadaverous face. He rubbed one of his downdrooping eyelids, said: 'Call Panthor Bolin.'
\par The Achusian capitalist got to his feet, strode to the witness ring. The robo-clerk's screen flashed for the record: 'Panthor  Bolin of Achus IV, certified witness in this System High Court.'
\par 'The oath of sincerity having been administered, Panther Bolin is prepared for testifying,' the robo-clerk reelslated.
\par 'Panthor Bolin, are you chief officer of the civil organization known as the Tax Watchers?' Vohnbrook asked.
\par 'I ... ah ... y-yes' Bolin faltered. He passed a large blue handkerchief across his forehead, staring sharply at McKie.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 He just now realizes what it is I must do, }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 McKie thought.
\par 'I show you this recording from the robo-legum indictment proceedings,' Vohnbrook said. 'It is certified by System police as being a conversation between yourself and Jorj X. McKie in which ... '
\par 'Your Honor!' Oulson objected. 'Both witnesses to this alleged conversation are present in this courtarena. There are more direct ways to bring out any pertinen
t information from this matter. Further, since the clear threat of a conspiracy charge remains in this case, I object to introducing this recording as forcing a man to testify against himself.'
\par 'Ser McKie is no longer on trial here and Ser Oulson is not McKie's attorney of record,' Vohnbrook gloated.
\par 'The objection does, however, have some merit,' Dooley said. He looked at McKie seated in the holding box.
\par 'There's nothing shameful about that conversation with Ser Bolin,' McKie said. 'I've no objection to introducing this record of the conversation.'
\par Bolin rose up on his toes, made as though to speak, sank back.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 Now he is certain, }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 McKie thought.
\par 'Then I will admit this record subject to judicial deletions,' Dooley said.
\par Clinton Watt, seated at the defense table, buried his gorgon head in his arms.
\par Vohnbrook, a death's-head grin on his long face, said: 'Ser Bolin, I show you this recording. Now, in this conversation, was Sabotage Agent McKie subjected to any form of coercion?'
\par 'Objection!' Oulson roared, surging to his feet. His scarred face was a scowling mask. 'At the time of this alleged recording, Ser McKie was not an agent of the Bureau!' He looked at Vohnbrook. 'Defense objects to the prosecutor's obvious effort to li
nk Ser McKie with ... '
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 'Alleged }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 conversation!' Vohnbrook snarled. 'Ser McKie himself admits the exchange!'
\par 
\par In a weary voice, Dooley said: 'Objection sustained. Unless tangible evidence of conspiracy is introduced here, references to Ser McKie as an agent of Sabotage will not be admitted here.'
\par 'But, Your Honor,' Vohnbrook protested, 'Ser McKie's own actions preclude any other interpretation!'
\par 'I've ruled on this point,' Dooley said 'Proceed.' 
\par McKie got to his feet in the holding box, said: 'Would Your  Honor permit me to act as a friend of the Court here?'
\par Dooley leaned back, hand on chin, turning the question over in his mind. A general feeling of uneasiness about the case was increasing in him and he couldn't pinpoint it. McKie's every action appeared s
uspect. Dooley reminded himself that the saboteur extraordinary was notorious for sly plots, for devious and convoluted schemes of the wildest and most improbable inversions -like onion layers in a five dimensional klein-shape. The man's success in practi
cing under the Gowachin legal code could be understood.
\par 'You may explain what you have in mind,' Dooley said, 'but I'm not yet ready to admit your statements into the record.'
\par 'The Bureau of Sabotage's own Code would clarify matters,' McKie said, realizing that these words burned his bridges behind him. 'My action in successfully sabotaging }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 acting }{
\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 Secretary Watt is a matter of record.'
\par McKie pointed to the gorgon mass visible as Watt lifted his head and glared across the room.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 'Acting }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 Secretary?' the judge asked.
\par 'So it must be presumed,' McKie said. 'Under the Bureau's Code, once the Secretary is sabotaged he ... '
\par 'Your Honor!' Oulson shouted. 'We are in danger of breach of security here! I understand these proceedings are being broadcast!'
\par 'As Director-in-Limbo of the Bureau of Sabotage, I will decide what is a breach of security and what isn't!' McKie snapped.
\par Watt returned his head to his arms, groaned.
\par Oulson sputtered.
\par Dooley stared at McKie in shock.
\par Vohnbrook broke the spell. The prosecutor said: 'Your Honor, this man has not been sworn to sincerity. I suggest we excuse Ser Bolin for the time being and have Ser McKie continue his }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 explanation }{
\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 under oath.'
\par Dooley took a deep breath, said: 'Does defense have any questions of Ser Bolin at this time?'
\par 'Not at this time,' Oulson muttered. 'I presume he's subject to recall?'
\par 'He is,' Dooley said, turning to McKie. 'Take the witness ring, Ser McKie.'

\par Bolin, moving like a sleepwalker, stepped ou
t of the ring, returned to the prosecution table. The Pan-Spechi's multifaceted eyes reflected an odd glitter, moving with a trapped sense of evasiveness. McKie entered the ring, took the oath and faced Vohnbrook, composing his features in a look of purpo
seful decisiveness that he  knew his actions must reflect.
\par 'You called yourself Director-in-Limbo of the Bureau of Sabotage,' Vohnbrook said. 'Would you explain that, please?'
\par Before McKie could answer, Watt lifted his head from his arms, growled: 'You traitor, McKie!'
\par Dooley grabbed the pommel of his sword of justice to indicate an absolute position and barked: 'I will tolerate no outbursts in my courts!'
\par Oulson put a hand on Watt's shoulder. Both of them glared at McKie. The medusa tendrils of Watt's head writhed as they ranged through the rainbow spectrum.
\par 'I caution the witness,' Dooley said, 'that his remarks would appear to admit a conspiracy. Anything he says now may be used against him.'
\par 'No conspiracy, Your Honor,' McKie said. He faced Vohnbrook, but
 appeared to be addressing Watt. 'Over the centuries, the function of Sabotage in the government has grown more and more open, but certain aspects of changing the guard, so to speak, have been held as a highly placed secret. The rule is that if a man can 
protect himself from sabotage he's fit to boss Sabotage. Once sabotaged, however, the Bureau's Secretary must resign and submit his position to the President and the full Cabinet.'
\par 'He's out?' Dooley asked.
\par 'Not necessarily,' McKie said. 'If the act of sabotage against the Secretary is profound enough, subtle enough, carries enough far reaching effects, the Secretary is replaced by the successful saboteur. He is, indeed, out.'
\par 'Then it's now up to the President and the Cabinet to decide between Ser Watt and yourself, is that what you're saying?' Dooley asked.
\par 'Me?' McKie asked. 'No, I'm Director-in-Limbo because I accomplished a successful act of sabotage against Ser Watt and because I happen to be senior saboteur extraordinary on duty.'
\par 'But it's alleged that you were fired,' Vohnbrook objected.
\par 'A formality,' McKie said. 'It's customary to fire the saboteur who's successful in such an effort. This makes him eligible for appointment as Secretary if he so aspires. However, I have no such ambition at this time.'
\par 
\par Watt jerked upright, staring at McKie.
\par McKie ran a finger around his collar, realizing the physical peril he was about to face. A glance at the Pan-Spechi confirmed the feeling. Panthor Bolin was holding himself in check by a visible  effort.
\par 'This is all very interesting,' Vohnbrook sneered, 'but how can it possibly have any bearing on the present action? The charge here is outlaw sabotage against the Tax Watchers represented by the person of Ser Panthor Bolin. If Ser McKie ... '
\par 'If the distinguished Prosecutor will permit me,' McKie said, 'I believe I can set his fears at rest. It should be obvious to -'
\par 'There's conspiracy here!' Vohnbrook shouted. 'What about the ... '
\par A loud pounding interrupted him as Judge Dooley lifted his sword, its theremin effect filling the room. When silence had been restored, the judge lowered his sword, replaced it firmly on the ledge in front of him.
\par Dooley took a moment to calm himself. He sensed now the delicate political edge he walked and thanked his stars that he had left the door open to rule that the present session was a hearing.
\par 'We will now proceed in an orderly fashion,' Dooley said. 'That's
 one of the things courts are for, you know.' He took a deep breath. 'Now, there are several people present whose dedication to the maintenance of law and order should be beyond question. I'd think that among those we should number Ser Prosecutor Vohnbroo
k
; the distinguished defense counsel, Ser Oulson: Ser Bolin, whose race is noted for its reasonableness and humanity; and the distinguished representatives of the Bureau of Sabotage, whose actions may at times annoy and anger us, but who are, we know, cons
ecrated to the principle of strengthening us and exposing our inner resources.'
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 This judge missed his calling, }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 McKie thought. }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 With speeches like that, he could get into the Legislative branch.
\par }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 Abashed, Vohnbrook sank back into his chair.
\par 'Now,' the judge said, 'unless I'm mistaken, Ser McKie has referred to two acts of sabotage.' Dooley glanced down at McKie. 'Ser McKie?'
\par 'So it would appear. Your Honor,' McKie said, hoping he read the judge's present attitude correctly. 'However, this court may be in a uniq}{\f793\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
ue position to rule on that very question. You see, Your Honor, the alleged act of sabotage to which I refer was initiated by a Pan-Spechi agent of the Bureau. Now, though, the secondary benefits of that action appear to be sought after by a cr\'e8
che mate of}{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752  that agent, whose ... '
\par 'You dare suggest that I'm not the holder of my cell's ego?' Bolin demanded.
\par Without knowing quite where it was or what it was, McKie was aware that a weapon had been trained on him by the Pan-Spechi. References in their culture to the weapon for defense of the ego were clear enough.
\par 'I make no such suggestion,' McKie said, speaking hastily and with as much sincerity as he could put into his voice. 'But surely you cannot have misinterpreted the terranic-human culture so much that you do not know what will happen now.'
\par 
\par Warned by some instinct, the judge and other spectators to this interchange remained silent.
\par Bolin appeared to be trembling in every cell of his body. 'I am distressed,' he muttered.
\par 'If there were a way to achieve the necessary rapport and avoid that distress I would have taken it,' McKie said. 'Can you see another way?'
\par Still trembling, Bolin said: 'I must do what I must do.'
\par In a low voice, Dooley said: 'Ser McKie, just what is going on here?'
\par 'Two cultures are, at last, attempting to understand each other,' McKie said. 'We've lived together in apparent understanding for centuries, but appearances can be deceptive.'
\par Oulson started to rise, was pulled back by Watt.
\par And McKie noted that his former Bureau chief had assessed the peril here. It was a point in Watt's favor.
\par 'You understand, Ser Bolin,' McKie said, watching the Pan-Spechi carefully, 'that these things must be brought into the open and discussed carefully before a decision can be reached in this court. It's a 
rule of law to which you've submitted. I'm inclined to favor your bid for the Secretariat, but my own decision awaits the outcome of this hearing.'
\par 'What things must be discussed?' Dooley demanded. 'And what gives you the right, Ser McKie, to call this a hearing?'
\par 'A figure of speech,' McKie said, but he kept his attention on the Pan-Spechi, wondering what the terrible weapon was that the race used in defense of its egos. 'What do you say, Ser Bolin?'
\par 'You protect the sanctity of your home life,' Bolin said. 'Do you deny me the same right?'
\par 'Sanctity, not secrecy,' McKie said.
\par Dooley looked from McKie to Bolin, noted the compressed-spring look of the Pan-Spechi, the way he kept a hand hidden in a jacket pocket. It occurred to the judge then that the Pan-Spec
hi might have a weapon ready to use against others in this court. Bolin had that look about him. Dooley hesitated on the point of calling guards, reviewed what he knew of the Pan-Spechi. He decided not to cause a crisis. The Pan-Spechi were admitted to th
e}{\f793\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
 concourse of humanity, good friends but terrible enemies, and there were always those allusions to their hidden powers, to their ego jealousies, to the fierceness with which they defended the secrecy of their cr\'e8ches.
\par }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 Slowly Bolin overcame the trembling. 'Say what you feel you must,' he growled.
\par 
\par McKie said a silent prayer of hope that the Pan-Spechi could control his reflexes, addressed himself to the nexus of pickups on the far wall that was recording this courtarena scene for broadcast to the entire universe.
\par 'A Pan-Spechi who took the name of Napoleon Bildoon was one of the leading agents in the Bureau of Sabotage,' McKie said.
\par 'Agent Bildoon dropped from sight at the time Panthor Bolin took over as chief of the Tax Watchers. It's highly probable that the Tax Watcher organization is an elaborate and subtle sabotage of the Bureau of Sabotage itself, a move originated by Bildoon.'

\par 'There is no such person as Bildoon!' Bolin cried. 
\par 'Ser McKie,' Judge Dooley said, 'would you care to continue this interchange in the privacy of my chambers?' The judge stared down at the saboteur, trying to appear kindly but firm.
\par 'Your Honor,' McKie said, 'may we out of respect for a fellow human, leave that decision to Ser Bolin?'
\par Bolin turned his multi-fac
eted eyes toward the bench, spoke in a low voice: 'If the court please, it were best this were done openly.' He jerked his hand from his pocket. It came out empty. He leaned across the table, gripped the far edge. 'Continue, if you please, Ser.'
\par McKie swallowed, momentarily overcome with admiration for the Pan-Spechi. 'It will be a distinct pleasure to serve under you, Ser Bolin,' McKie said.
\par 'Do what you must!' Bolin rasped.
\par McKie looked from the wonderment in the faces of Watt and the attorneys up to the 
questioning eyes of Judge Dooley. 'In Pan-Spechi parlance, there is no person called Bildoon. But there was such a person, a group mate of Ser Bolin. I hope you notice the similarity in the names they chose for themselves?'
\par 'Ah ... yes,' Dooley said.
\par 'I'm 
afraid I've been somewhat of a nosey Parker, a peeping Tom and several other categories of snoop where the Pan-Spechi are concerned,' McKie said. 'But it was because I suspected the act of sabotage to which I've referred here. The Tax Watchers revealed to
o much inside knowledge of the Bureau of Sabotage.'
\par 'I ... ah ... am not quite sure I understand you,' Dooley said.
\par 'The best kept secret in the universe, the Pan-Spechi cyclic change of gender and identity, is no longer a secret where I'm concerned,' McKie said. He swallowed as he saw Bolin's fingers go white where they tightly gripped the prosecution table.
\par 'It relates to the issue at hand?' Dooley asked.
\par 'Most definitely, Your Honor,' McKie said. 'You see, the Pan-Spechi have a unique gland that controls 
mentation, dominance, the relationship between reason and instinct. The five group mates are, in reality, one person. I wish to make that clear for reasons of legal necessity.'
\par 'Legal necessity?' Dooley asked. He glanced down at the obviously distressed Bolin, back to McKie.
\par 'The gland, when it's functioning, confers ego dominance on the Pan-Spechi in whom it functions. But it functions for a time that's definitely limited - twenty-five to thirty years.' McKie looked at Bolin. Again, the Pan-Spechi was trem
bling. 'Please understand,  Ser Bolin,' he said, 'that I do this out of necessity and that this is not an act of sabotage.'
\par 
\par Bolin lifted his face toward McKie. The Pan-Spechi's features appeared contorted in grief. 'Get it over with, man!' he rasped.
\par 'Yes
,' McKie said, turning back to the judge's puzzled face. 'Ego transfer in the Pan-Spechi, Your Honor, involves a transfer of what may be termed basic-experience-learning. It's accomplished through physical contractor when the ego holder dies, no matter ho
w}{\f793\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752  far he may be separated from the cr\'e8che, this seems to fire up the eldest of the cr\'e8
che triplets. The ego-single also bequeaths a verbal legacy to his mate whenever possible - and that's most of the time. Specifically, it's this time.'
\par }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 Dooley leaned back. He was beginning to see the legal question McKie's account had posed.
\par 'The act of sabotage which might make a Pan-Spechi eligible for appointment as Secretary of the Bureau of Sabotage was initiated by a ... ah ... cell mate of the Ser Bolin in court today, is that it?' Dooley asked.
\par McKie wiped his brow. 'Correct, Your Honor.'
\par 'But that cell mate is no longer the ego dominant, eh?'
\par 'Quite right, Your Honor!'
\par 'The ... ah ... former ego holder, this ... ah ... Bildoon, is no longer eligible?'
\par }{\f793\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 'Bildoon, or what was once Bildoon, is a creature operating solely on instinct now, Your Honor,' McKie said. 'Capable of acting as cr\'e8
che nurse for a time and, eventually, fulfilling another destiny I'd rather not explain.'
\par }{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 'I see.' Dooley looked at the weather cover of the court arena. He was beginning to see what McKie had risked here. 'And you favor this, ah, Ser Bolin's bid for the Secretariat?' Dooley asked.
\par 'If President Bindley and the Cabinet follow the recommendation of the Bureau's senior agents, the procedure always followed in the past, Ser Bolin will be the new Secretary,' McKie said. 'I favor this.'
\par 'Why?' Dooley asked.
\par 'Because of this unique roving ego, the Pan-Spechi have a more communal attitude toward fellow sentients than do most other sp}{\f793\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 
ecies admitted to the concourse of humanity,' McKie said. 'This translates as a sense of responsibility toward all life. They're not necessarily maudlin about it. They oppose where it's necessary to build strength. Their cr\'e8
che life demonstrates several cl}{\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 ear examples of this which I'd prefer not to describe.'
\par 'I see,' Dooley said, but he had to admit to himself that he did not. McKie's allusions to unspeakable practices were beginning to annoy him. 'And you feel that this Bildoon-Bolin act of sabotage qual
ifies him, provided this court rules they are one and the same person?'
\par 'We're not the same person!' Bolin cried. 'You don't dare say that ... that shambling, clinging \'85 '
\par 'Easy,' McKie said. 'Ser Bolin, I'm sure you see the need for this legal fiction.'
\par 'Legal fiction,' Bolin said as though clinging to the words. The multi-faceted eyes glared across the courtarena at McKie. 'Thank you for the verbal nicety, McKie.'
\par 'You've not answered my question, Ser McKie,' Dooley said, ignoring the exchange with Bolin.
\par 'Sabotaging Ser Watt through an attack on the entire Bureau contains subtlety and finesse never before achieved in such an effort,' McKie said. 'The entire Bureau will be strengthened by it.'
\par McKie glanced at Watt. The acting Secretary's medusa tangle had ceased its writhing. He was staring at Bolin with a speculative look in his eyes. Sensing the quiet in the court-arena, he glanced up at McKie.
\par 'Don't you agree, Ser Watt?' McKie asked.
\par 'Oh, yes. Quite,' Watt said.
\par The note of sincerity in Watt's voice startled the judge. For the first time, he wondered at the dedication which these men brought to their jobs.
\par 'Sabotage is a very sensitive Bureau,' Dooley said. 'I've some serious reservations -'
\par 'If Your Honor please,' McKie said, 'forbearance is one of the
 chief attributes a saboteur can bring to his duties. Now, I wish you to understand what our Pan-Spechi friend has done here this day. Let us suppose that I had spied upon the most intimate moments between you, Judge, and your wife, and that I reported th
e
m in detail here in open court with half the universe looking on. Let us suppose further that you had the strictest moral code against such discussions with outsiders. Let us suppose that I made these disclosures in the basest terms with every four-letter
 word at my command. Let us suppose that you were armed, traditionally, with a deadly weapon to strike at such blasphemers, such -'
\par 'Filth!' Bolin grated.
\par 'Yes,' McKie said. 'Filth. Do you suppose, Your Honor, that you could have stood by without killing me?'
\par 'Good heavens!' Dooley said.

\par 'Ser Bolin,' McKie said, 'I offer you and all your race my most humble apologies.'
\par 'I'd hoped once to undergo the ordeal in the privacy of a judge's chambers with as few outsiders as possible,' Bolin said. 'But once you were started in open court ... '
\par 'It had to be this way,' McKie said. 'If we'd done it in private,  people would've come to be suspicious about a Pan-Spechi in control of ... '
\par 'People?' Bolin asked.
\par 'Non Pan-Spechi,' McKie said. 'It'd have been a barrier between our species.
\par 'And we've been strengthened by all this,' McKie said. 'Those provisions of the Constitution that 
provide the people with a slowly moving government have been demonstrated anew. We've admitted the public to the inner workings of Sabotage, shown them the valuable character of the man who'll be the new Secretary.'
\par 'I've not yet ruled on the critical issue here,' Dooley said.
\par 'But Your Honor!' McKie said.
\par 'With all due respect to you as a saboteur extraordinary, Ser McKie,' Dooley said, 'I'll make my decision on evidence gathered under my direction.' He looked at Bolin. 'Ser Bolin, would you permit an agen
t of this court to gather such evidence as will allow me to render verdict without fear of harming my own species?'
\par 'We're humans together,' Bolin growled.
\par 'But terranic humans hold the balance of power,' Dooley said. 'I owe allegiance to law, yes, but my terranic fellows depend on me, too. I have a ... '
\par 'You wish your own agents to determine if Ser McKie has told the truth about us?'
\par 'Ah ... yes,' Dooley said.
\par Bolin looked at McKie. 'Ser McKie, it is I who apologize to you. I had not realized how deeply xenophobia penetrated your fellows.'
\par 'Because,' McKie said, 'outside of your natural modesty, you have no such fear. I suspect you know the phenomenon only through reading of us.'
\par 'But all strangers are potential sharers of identity,' Bolin said. 'Ah, well.'
\par 'If you're through with your little chat,' Dooley said, 'would you care to answer my question, Ser Bolin? This is still I hope, a court of law.'
\par 'Tell me, Your Honor,' Bolin said, 'would you permit me to witness the tenderest intimacies between you and your wife?'
\par 
\par Dooley's face darkened, but he saw suddenly in all of its stark detail the extent of McKie's analogy and it was to the judge's credit that he rose to the occasion. 'If it were necessary to promote understanding,' he rasped, 'yes!'
\par 'I believe you would,' Bolin murmured. He took a deep breath. 'After what I've been through here today, one more sacrifice can be borne, I guess. I grant your investigators the privilege requested, but advise that they be discreet.'
\par 'It will strengthen you for the trials ahead as Secretary of the Bureau,' McKie said. 'The Secretary, you must bear in mind, has  no immunities from sabotage whatsoever.'
\par 'But,' Bolin said, 'the Secretary's legal orders carrying out his Constitutional functions must be obeyed by all agents.'
\par McKie nodded, seeing in the glitter of Bolin's eyes, a vista of peeping Tom assignments with endless detailed reports to the Secretary of Sabotage - at least until the fellow's curiosity had been satisfied and his need for revenge satiated.
\par But the others in the court-room, not having McKie's insight, merely wondered at the question: }{\i\fs20\insrsid4328311\charrsid14107752 What did he really mean by that?

 which is what they call lovemaking through the grill of a consel gate
\par The type-look was almost perfect except when he forgot himself while passing through one of the deeper jungle glades
\par His skin tended to shade down to green then, fading him into the background of leaves and vines, giving a strange disembodiment to the mud-grey shirt and ragged trousers, the inevitable frayed straw hat and rawhide sandals soled with pieces cut from w
orn tires.
\par Such lapses became less and less frequent the farther he got from the Parana headwaters, the sertao hinterland of Goyaz where men with his bang-cut black hair and glittering eyes were common
\par By the time he reached bandeirantes country, he had achieved almost perfect control over the chameleon effect.
\par But now he was out of the jungle growth and into the brown dirt tracks that separated the parceled farms of the resettlement plan. In his own way, he knew he was approaching the bandeirante checkpoin
ts, and with an almost human gesture, he fingered the cedula de gracias al sacar, the certificate of white blood, tucked safely beneath his shirt. Now and again, when humans were not near, he practiced speaking aloud the name that had been chosen for him
\emdash "Antonio Raposo Tavares."
\par The sound was a bit stridulant, harsh on the edges, but he knew it would pass. It already had. Goyaz Indies were notorious for the strange inflection of their speech. The farm folk who had given him a roof and fed him the previous night had said as much.

\par When their questions had become pressing, he had squatted on the doorstep and played his flute, the qena of the Andes Indian that he carried in a leather purse hung from his shoulder. He had kept the sound to a conventional, non-dan
gerous pitch. The gesture of the flute was a symbol of the region. When a Guarani put flute to nose and began playing, that was a sign words were ended.
\par The farm folk had shrugged and retired.
\par Now, he could see red-brown rooftops ahead and the white crysta
l shimmering of a bandeirante tower with its aircars alighting and departing. The scene held an odd hive-look He stopped, finding himself momentarily overcome by the touch of instincts that he knew he had to master or fail in the ordeal to come.
\par He united 
his mental identity then, thinking, We are greenslaves subservient to the greater whole The thought lent him an air of servility that was like a shield against the stares of the humans trudging past all around him. His kind knew many mannerisms and had le
arned early that servility was a form of concealment.
\par Presently, he resumed his plodding course toward the town and the tower.
\par The dirt track gave way to a two-lane paved market road with its footpaths in the ditches on both sides. This, in turn, curved alo
ngside a four-deck commercial transport highway where even the footpaths were paved. And now there were groundcars and aircars in greater number, and he noted that the flow of people on foot was increasing.
\par Thus far, he had attracted no dangerous attention The occasional snickering side-glance from natives of the area could be safely ignored, he knew. Probing stares held peril, and he had detected none. The servility shielded him.
\par The sun was well along toward mid-morning and the day's heat was beginning to press down on the earth, raising a moist hothouse sunk from the dirt beside the pathway, mingling the perspiration odors of humanity around him.
\par And they were around him now, close and pressing, moving slower and slower as they approached the checkpoint bottleneck. Presently, the forward motion stopped. Progress resolved itself into shuffle and stop, shuffle and stop.
\par This was the critical test now and there was no avoiding it. He waited with something like an Indian's stoic patience. His breathing had gro
wn deeper to compensate for the heat, and he adjusted it to match that of the people around him, suffering the temperature rise for the sake of blending into his surroundings.
\par Andes Indians didn't breathe deeply here in the lowlands.
\par Shuffle and stop.
\par Shuffle and stop.
\par He could see the checkpoint now.
\par Fastidious bandeirantes in sealed white cloaks with plastic helmets, gloves, and boots stood in a double row within a shaded brick corridor leading into the town. He could see sunlight hot on the street be
yond the corridor and people hurrying away there after passing the gantlet.
\par The sight of that free area beyond the corridor sent an ache of longing through all the parts of him. The suppression warning flashed out instantly on the heels of that instinctive reaching emotion.
\par No distraction could be permitted now; he was into the hands of the first bandeirante, a hulking blonde fellow with pink skin and blue eyes.
\par "Step along now! Lively now!" the fellow said.
\par A gloved hand propelled him toward two bandeirantes standing on the right side of the line.
\par "Give this one an extra treatment," the blonde giant called. "He's from the upcountry by the look of him."
\par The other two bandeirantes had him now, one jamming a breather mask over his face, the other fitting a plastic bag over him. A tube trailed from the bag out to machinery somewhere in the street beyond the corridor.
\par "Double shot!" one of the bandeirantes called.
\par Fuming blue gas puffed out the bag around him, and he took a sharp, gasping breath through the mask.
\par Agony!
\par The gas drove through every multiple linkage of his being with needles of pain.
\par We must not weaken, he thought.
\par But it was a deadly pain, killing. The linkages were beginning to weaken.
\par "Okay on this one," the bag handler called.
\par The mask was pulled away. The bag was slipped off. Hands propelled him down the corridor toward the sunlight.
\par "Lively now! Don't hold up the line."
\par The stink of the poison gas was all around him. It was a new one\emdash a dissembler. They hadn't prepared him for this poison!
\par Now, he was into the sunlight and turning down a street lined with fruit stalls, merchants bartering with customers or standing fat and watchful behind their displays.
\par In his extremity, the fruit beckoned to him with the promise of life-saving sanctuary for a few parts of him, but the integrating totality fought off the lure. He shuffled as fast as he dared, dodging past the customers, through the knots of idlers.

\par "You like to buy some fresh oranges?"
\par An oily dark hand thrust two oranges toward his face.
\par "Fresh oranges from the green country. Never been a bug anywhere near these."
\par He avoided the hand, although the odor of the oranges came near overpowering him.
\par Now, he was clear of the stalls, around a corner down a narrow side street. Another corner and he saw far away to his left the lure of greenery in open country, the free area beyond the town.
\par He turned toward the green, increasing his speed, measuring out the time still available to him. There was still a chance. Poison clung to his clothing, but free air was filtering through the fabric\emdash and the thought of victory was like an antidote.

\par We can make it yet!
\par The green drew closer and closer\emdash trees and ferns beside a river bank. He heard the running water. There was a bridge thronging with foot traffic from converging streets.
\par No help for it; he joined the throng, avoided contact as much as possible. The linkages of his legs and back were beginning to go, and he knew
 the wrong kind of blow could dislodge whole segments. He was over the bridge without disaster. A dirt track led off the path and down toward the river.
\par He turned toward it, stumbled against one of two men carrying a pig in a net slung between them. Part of the shell on his right upper leg gave way and he could feel it begin to slip down inside his pants.
\par The man he had hit took two backward steps, almost dropped the end of the burden.
\par "Careful!" the man shouted.
\par The man at the other end of the net said: "Damn drunks."
\par The pig set up a squirming, squealing distraction.
\par In this moment, he slipped past them onto the dirt track leading down toward the river. He could see the water down there now, boiling with aeration from the barrier filters.
\par Behind him, one of the pig carriers said: "I don't think he was drunk, Carlos. His skin felt dry and hot. Maybe he was sick."
\par The track turned around an embankment of raw dirt dark brown with dampness and dipped toward a tunnel through ferns and bushes. The men with the pi
g could no longer see him, he knew, and he grabbed at his pants where the part of his leg was slipping, scurried into the green tunnel.
\par Now, he caught sight of his first mutated bee. It was dead, having entered the barrier vibration area here without any p
rotection against that deadliness. The bee was one of the butterfly type with iridescent yellow and orange wings. It lay in the cup of a green leaf at the center of a shaft of sunlight.
\par He shuffled past, having recorded the bee's shape and color. They had 
considered the bees as a possible answer, but there were serious drawbacks to this course. A bee could not reason with humans, that was the key fact. And humans had to listen to reason soon, else all life would end.
\par There came the sound of someone hurrying down the path behind him, heavy footsteps thudding on the earth.

\par He was reduced to a slow shuffling now and soon it would be only crawling progress, he knew. Eyes searched the greenery around him for a place of concealment. A thin break in the f
ern wall on his left caught his attention. Tiny human footprints led into it\emdash 
children. He forced his way through the ferns, found himself on a low narrow path along the embankment. Two toy aircars, red and blue, had been abandoned on the path. His staggering foot pressed them into the dirt.
\par The path led close to a wall of black dirt festooned with creepers, around a sharp turn, and onto the lip of a shallow cave. More toys lay in the green gloom at the cave's mouth.
\par He knelt, crawled over the toys into the blessed dankness, lay there a moment, waiting.
\par The pounding footsteps hurried past a few feet below.
\par Voices reached up to him.
\par "He was headed toward the river. Think he was going to jump in?"
\par "Who knows? But I think me for sure he was sick."
\par "Here; down this way. Somebody's been down this way."
\par The voices grew indistinct, blended with the babbling sound of the river.
\par The men were going on down the path. They had missed his hiding place. But why had they pursued him? He had not seriously injured the one by stumbling against him. Surely they did not suspect.
\par Slowly, he steeled himself for what had to be done, brought his specialized parts into play, and began burrowing into the earth at the end of the cave. Deeper and deeper he burrowed, thrusting the excess d
irt behind and out to make it appear the cave had collapsed.
\par Ten meters in he went before stopping. His store of energy contained just enough reserve for the next stage. He turned on his back, scattering the dead parts of his legs and back, exposing the qu
een and her guard cluster to the dirt beneath his chitinous spine. Orifices opened at his thighs, exuded the cocoon foam, the soothing green cover that would harden into a protective shell.
\par This was victory; the essential parts had survived.
\par Time was the thing now\emdash ten and one-half days to gather new energy, go through the metamorphosis, and disperse. Soon, there would be thousands of him\emdash 
each with its carefully mimicked clothing and identification papers and appearance of humanity.
\par Identical\emdash each of them.
\par There would be other checkpoints, but not as severe; other barriers, lesser ones.
\par This human copy had proved a good one. They had learned many things from study of their scattered captives and from the odd crew directed by the red-haired human
 female they'd trapped in the sertao. How strange she was: like a queen and not like a queen. It was so difficult to understand human creatures, even when you permitted them limited freedom\'85
 almost impossible to reason with them. Their slavery to the planet would have to be proved dramatically, perhaps.
\par The queen stirred near the cool dirt. They had learned new things this time about escaping notice. All of the subsequent colony clusters would share that knowledge. One of them\emdash at least\emdash would get through to 
the city by the Amazon "River Sea" where the death-for-all originated. One had to get through.
\par Senhor Gabriel Martinho, prefect of the Mato Grosso Barrier Company, paced his study, muttering to himself as he passed the tall, narrow window that admitted the
 evening sunlight. Occasionally, he paused to glare down at his son, Joao, who sat on a tapir-leather sofa beneath one of the tall bookcases that lined the room.
\par The elder Martinho was a dark wisp of a man, limb-thin, with grey hair and cavernous brown eye
s above an eagle nose, slit mouth, and boot-toe chin. He wore old-style black clothing as befitted his position, his linen white against the black, and with golden cuffstuds glittering as he waved his arms.
\par "I am an object of ridicule!" he snarled.
\par Joao, a younger copy of the father, his hair still black and wavy, absorbed the statement in silence. He wore a bandeirante's white coverall suit sealed into plastic boots at the calf.
\par "An object of ridicule!" the elder Martinho repeated.
\par It began to grow dark in
 the room, the quick tropic darkness hurried by thunderheads piled along the horizon. The waning daylight carried a hazel blue cast. Heat lightning spattered the patch of sky visible through the tall window, sent dazzling electric radiance into the study.
 Drumming thunder followed. As though that were the signal, the house sensors turned on lights wherever there were humans. Yellow illumination filled the study.
\par The Prefect stopped in front of his son. "Why does my own son, a bandeirante, a jefe of the Irmandades, spout these Carsonite stupidities?"
\par Joao looked at the floor between his boots. He felt both resentment and shame. To disturb his father this way, that was a hurtful thing, with the elder Martinho's delicate heart. But the old man was so blind!
\par "Th
ose rabble farmers laughed at me," the elder Martinho said. "I told them we'd increase the green area by ten thousand hectares this month, and they laughed. 'Your own son does not even believe this!' they said. And they told me some of the things you had 
been saying."
\par "I am sorry I have caused you distress, father," Joao said. "The fact that I'm a bandeirante\'85"He shrugged. "How else could I have learned the truth about this extermination program?"
\par His father quivered.
\par "Joao! Do you sit there and tell me you took a false oath when you formed your Irmandades band?"
\par "That's not the way it was, father."
\par Joao pulled a sprayman's emblem from his breast pocket, fingered it. "I believed it\'85 then. We could shape mutated bees to fill every gap in the insect ecology. T
his I believed. Like the Chinese, I said: 'Only the useful shall live!' But that was several years ago, father, and since then I have come to realize we don't have a complete understanding of what usefulness means."
\par "It was a mistake to have you educated i
n North America," his father said. "That's where you absorbed this Carsonite heresy. It's all well and good for them to refuse to join the rest of the world in the Ecological Realignment; they do not have as many million mouths to feed. But my own son!"

\par Joao spoke defensively: "Out in the red areas you see things, father. These things are difficult to explain. Plants look healthier out there and the fruit is\'85"
\par "A purely temporary thing," his father said. "We will shape bees to meet whatever need we find. The destroyers take food from our mouths. It is very simple. They must die and be replaced by creatures which serve a function useful to mankind."
\par "The birds are dying, father," Joao said.
\par "We are saving the birds! We have specimens of every kind in our sanctuaries. We will provide new foods for them to\'85"
\par "But what happens if our barriers are breached\'85 before we can replace the population of natural predators? What happens then?"
\par The elder Martinho shook a thin finger under his son's nose. "This is nonsense! 
I will hear no more of it! Do you know what else those mameluco farmers said? They said they have seen bandeirantes reinfesting the green areas to prolong their jobs! That is what they said. This, too, is nonsense\emdash 
but it is a natural consequence of defeatist talk just such as I have heard from you tonight. And every setback we suffer adds strength to such charges!"
\par "Setbacks, father?"
\par "I have said it: setbacks!"
\par Senhor Prefect Martinho turned, paced to his desk and back. Again, he stopped in front of his son, placed hands on hips. "You refer to the Piratininga, of course?"
\par "You accuse me, father?"
\par "Your Irmandades were on that line."
\par "Not so much as a flea got through us!"
\par "Yet, a week ago the Piratininga was green. Now, it is crawling. Crawling!"
\par "I cannot watch every bandeirante in the Mato Grosso," Joao protested. "If they\'85"
\par "The IEO gives us only six months to clean up," the elder Martinho said. He raised his hands, palms up; his face was flushed. "Six months! Then they throw an embargo around all Brazil\emdash 
the way they have done with North America." He lowered his hands. "Can you imagine the pressures on me? Can you imagine the things I must listen to about the bandeirantes and especially about my own son?"
\par Joao scratched his chin with the sprayman's emblem. The reference to the International Ecological Organization made him think of Dr. Rhin Kelly, the IEO's lovely field director. His mind pictured her as he had l
ast seen her in the A' Chigua nightclub at Bahia\emdash red-haired, green-eyed\'85 so lovely and strange. But she had been missing almost six weeks now\emdash somewhere in the sertao, and there were those who said she must be dead.
\par Joao looked at his father. If only the old man weren't so excitable. "You excite yourself needlessly, father," he said. "The Piratininga was not a full barrier, just a\'85"
\par "Excite myself!"
\par The Prefect's nostrils dilated; he bent toward his son. "Already we have gone past two deadlines. We gained an
 extension when I announced you and the bandeirantes of Diogo Alvarez had cleared the Piratininga. How do I explain now that it is reinfested, that we have the work to do over?"
\par Joao returned the sprayman's emblem to his pocket. It was obvious he'd not be 
able to reason with his father this night. Frustration sent a nerve quivering along Joao's jaw. The old man had to be told, though; someone had to tell him. And someone of his father's stature had to get back to the Bureau, shake them up there, and make t
hem listen.
\par The Prefect returned to his desk, sat down. He picked up an antique crucifix, one that the great Aleihadinho had carved in ivory. He lifted it, obviously seeking to restore his serenity, but his eyes went wide and glaring. Slowly, he returned th
e crucifix to its position on the desk, keeping his attention on it.
\par "Joao," he whispered.
\par It's his heart! Joao thought.
\par He leaped to his feet, rushed to his father's side. "Father! What is it?"
\par The elder Martinho pointed, hand trembling.
\par Through the spike
d crown of thorns, across the agonized ivory face, over the straining muscles of the Christ figure crawled an insect. It was the color of the ivory, faintly reminiscent of a beetle in shape, but with a multi-clawed fringe along its wings and thorax, and w
ith furry edging to its abnormally long antennae.
\par The elder Martinho reached for a roll of papers to smash the insect, but Joao put out a hand restraining him. "Wait. This is a new one. I've never seen anything like it. Give me a handlight. We must follow it, find where it nests."
\par Senhor Prefect Martinho muttered under his breath, withdrew a small permalight from a drawer of the desk, handed the light to his son.
\par Joao peered at the insect, still not using the light. "How strange it is," he said. "See how it exactly matches the tone of the ivory."
\par The insect stopped, pointed its antennae toward the men.
\par "Things have been seen," Joao said. "There are stories. Something like this was found near one of the barrier villages last month. It was inside the green area
, on a path beside a river. Two fanners found it while searching for a sick man." Joao looked at his father. "They are very watchful of sickness in the newly green regions, you know. There have been epidemics\'85 and that is another thing."
\par "There is no relationship," his father snapped. "Without insects to carry disease, we will have less illness."
\par "Perhaps," Joao said, and his tone said he did not believe it.
\par Joao returned his attention to the insect. "I do not think our ecologists know all they say they do.
 And I mistrust our Chinese advisors. They speak in such flowery terms of the benefits from eliminating useless insects, but they will not let us go into their green areas and inspect. Excuses. Always excuses. I think they are having troubles they do not 
wish us to know."
\par "That's foolishness," the elder Martinho growled, but his tone said this was not a position he cared to defend. "They are honorable men. Their way of life is closer to our socialism than it is to the decadent capitalism of North America. Y
our trouble is you see them too much through the eyes of those who educated you."
\par "I'll wager this insect is one of the spontaneous mutations," Joao said. "It is almost as though they appeared according to some plan. Find me something in which I may capture this creature and take it to the laboratory."
\par The elder Martinho remained standing by his chair. "Where will you say it was found?"
\par "Right here," Joao said.
\par "You will not hesitate to expose me to more ridicule?"
\par "But father\'85"
\par "Can't you hear what they will say? In his own home this insect is found. It is a strange new kind. Perhaps he breeds them there to reinfest the green."
\par "Now you are talking nonsense, father. Mutations are common in a threatened species. And we cannot deny there is a threat to insect species\emdash 
the poisons, the barrier vibrations, the traps. Get me a container, father. I cannot leave this creature, or I'd get a container myself."
\par "And you will tell where it was found?"
\par "I can do nothing else. We must cordon off this area, search it out. This could be\'85 an accident\'85"
\par "Or a deliberate attempt to embarrass me."
\par Joao took his attention from the insect, studied his father. That was a possibility, of course. The Carsonites had friends in many places\'85 and some were fanatics who would stoop to any scheme. Still\'85
\par Decision came to Joao. He returned his attention to the motionless insect. His father had to be told, had to be reasoned with at any cost. Someone whose voice carried authority had to get down to the Capitol and make them listen.
\par "Our earliest poisons killed off the weak and selected out those insects immune to this threat," Joao said. "Only the immune remained to breed. The poisons we use now\'85 some of them, do not leave such loopholes, and the deadly vibrations at the barriers
\'85"He shrugged. "This is a form of beetle, father. I will show you a thing."
\par Joao drew a long, thin whistle of shiny metal from his pocket. "There was a time when this called countless beetles to their deaths. I had merely to tune it across th
eir attraction spectrum." He put the whistle to his lips, blew while turning the end of it.
\par No sound audible to human ears came from the instrument, but the beetle's antennae writhed.
\par Joao removed the whistle from his mouth.
\par The antennae stopped writhing.
\par "It stayed put, you see," Joao said. "And there are indications of malignant intelligence among them. The insects are far from extinction, father\'85 and they are beginning to strike back."
\par "Malignant intelligence, pah!"
\par "You must believe me, father," Joao sa
id. "No one else will listen. They laugh and say we are too long in the jungle. And where is our evidence? And they say such stories could be expected from ignorant farmers but not from bandeirantes. You must listen, father, and believe. It is why I was c
hosen to come here\'85 because you are my father and you might listen to your own son."
\par "Believe what?" the elder Martinho demanded, and he was the Prefect now, standing erect, glaring coldly at his son.
\par "In the sertao of Goyaz last week," Joao said, "Antonil Lisboa's bandeirante lost three men who\'85"
\par "Accidents."
\par "They were killed with formic acid and oil of copahu."
\par "They were careless with their poisons. Men grow careless when they\'85"
\par "Father! The formic acid was a particularly strong type, but still recognizable as having been\'85 or being of a type manufactured by insects. And the men were drenched with it. While the oil of copahu
\par M
\par "You imply that insects such as this\'85" The Prefect pointed to the motionless creature on the crucifix. "\'85 blind creatures such as this\'85"
\par "They're not blind, father."
\par "I did not mean literally blind, but without intelligence," the elder Martinho said. "You cannot be seriously implying that these creatures attacked humans and killed them."
\par "We have yet to discover precisely how the men were slain," Joao said. "We have only their bodies and the physical evidence at the scene. But there have been other deaths, father, and men missing, and we grow more and more certain that\'85"
\par He broke off as the beetle crawled off the crucifix onto the desk. Immediately, it darkened to brown, blending with the wood surface.
\par "Please, father. Get me a container."
\par The beetle reached the edge of the desk, hesitated. Its antennae curled back, then forward.
\par "I will get you a container only if you promise to use discretion in your story of where this creature was found," the Prefect said.
\par "Father, I\'85"
\par The beetle leaped off the desk far out into the middle of the room, scuttled to the wall, up the wall, into a crack beside a window.
\par Joao pressed the switch of the handlight, directed its beam into the hole which had swallowed the strange beetle.
\par "How long has this hole been here, father?"
\par "For years. It was a flaw in the masonry\'85 an earthquake, I believe."
\par Joao turned, cro
ssed to the door in three strides, went through an arched hallway, down a flight of stone steps, through another door and short hall, through a grillwork gate, and into the exterior garden. He set the handlight to full intensity, washed its blue glare ove
r the wall beneath the study window.
\par "Joao, what are you doing?"
\par "My job, father," Joao said. He glanced back, saw that the elder Martinho had stopped just outside the gate.
\par Joao returned his attention to the exterior wall, washed the blue glare of light on the stones beneath the window. He crouched low, running the light along the ground, peering behind each clod, erasing all shadows.
\par His searching scrutiny passed over the raw earth, turned to the bushes, then the lawn.
\par Joao heard his father come up behind.
\par "Do you see it, son?"
\par "No, father."
\par "You should have allowed me to crush it."
\par From the outer garden that bordered the road and the stone fence, there came a piercing stridulation. It hung on the air in almost tangible waves, making Joao think of the hunti
ng cry of jungle predators. A shiver moved up his spine. He turned toward the driveway where he had parked his airtruck, sent the blue glare of light stabbing there.
\par He broke off, staring at the lawn. "What is that?"
\par The ground appeared to be in motion, reaching out toward them like the curling of a wave on a beach. Already, they were cut off from the house. The wave was still some ten paces away, but moving in rapidly.
\par Joao stood up, clutched his father's arm. He spoke quietly, hoping not to alarm the old man further. "We must get to my truck, father. We must run across them."
\par "Them?"
\par "Those are like the insect we saw inside, father\emdash millions of them. Perhaps they are not beetles, after all. Perhaps they are like army ants. We must make it to the truck. I ha
ve equipment and supplies there. We will be safe inside. It is a bandeirante truck, father. You must run with me. I will help you."
\par They began to run, Joao holding his father's arm, pointing the way with the light.
\par Let his heart be strong enough, Joao prayed.
\par They were into the creeping wave of insects then, but the creatures leaped aside, opening a pathway which closed behind the running men.
\par The white form of the airtruck loomed out of the shadows at the far curve of the driveway about fifteen meters ahead.
\par "Joao\'85 my heart," the elder Martinho gasped.
\par "You can make it," Joao panted. "Faster!" He almost lifted his father from the ground for the last few paces.
\par They were at the wide rear door into the truck's lab compartment now. Joao yanked open the door, slapped the light switch, reached for a spray hood and poison gun. He stopped, stared into the yellow-lighted compartment.
\par Two men sat there\emdash sertao Indians by the look of them, with bright glaring eyes and bang-cut black hair beneath straw hats. They looked to be identical twins\emdash 
even to the mud-grey clothing and sandals, the leather shoulder bags. The beetle-like insects crawled around them, up the walls, over the instruments and vials.
\par "What the devil?" Joao blurted.
\par One of the pair held a qena flute. He gestured with it, spoke in a rasping, oddly inflected voice: "Enter. You will not be harmed if you obey."
\par Joao felt his father sag, caught the old man in his arms. How light he felt! Joao stepped up into the truck, carrying his father. The elder Martinho breathed in short, painful gasps. His face was a pale blue and sweat stood out on his forehead.
\par "Joao," he whispered. "Pain\'85 my chest."
\par "Medicine, father," Joao said. "Where is your medicine?"
\par "House," the old man said.
\par "It appears to be dying," one of the Indians rasped.
\par Still holding his father in his arms, Joao whirled toward the pair, blazed: "I don't know who you are or why you loosed those bugs here, but my father's dying and needs help. Get out of my way!"
\par "Obey or both die," said the Indian with the flute.
\par "He needs his medicine and a doctor," Joao pleaded. He didn't like the way the Indian pointed that flute. The motion suggested the instrument was actually a weapon.
\par "What part has failed?" asked the other Indian. He stared curiously at Joao's father. The old man's breathing had become shallow and rapid.
\par "It's his heart," Joao said. "I know you farmers don't think he's acted fast enough for\'85"
\par "Not farmers," said the one with the flute. "Heart?"
\par "Pump, said the other.
\par "Pump." The Indian with the flute stood up from the bench at the front of the lab, gestured down. "Put\'85 father here."
\par The other one got off the bench, stood aside.
\par In spite of fear for his father, Joao was caught by the strange look of this pair, the fine, scale-like lines in their skin, the glittering brilliance of their eyes.
\par "Put father here," repeated the one with the flute, pointing at the bench. "Help can be\'85"
\par "Attained," said the other one.
\par "Attained," said the one with the flute.
\par Joao focused now on the masses of insects around the walls, the waiting quietude in their ranks. They were like the one in the study.
\par The old man's breathing was now very shallow, very rapid.
\par He's dying, Joao thought in desperation.
\par "Help can be attained," repeated the one with the flute. "If you obey, we will not harm."
\par The Indian lifted his flute, pointed it at Joao like a weapon. "Obey."
\par There was no mistaking the gesture.
\par Slowly, Joao advanced, deposited his father gently on the bench.
\par The other Indian bent over the elder Martinho's head, raised an eyelid. There was a professional directness about the gesture. The Indian pushed gently on the dying man's diaphragm, removed the Prefect's belt,
 loosened his collar. A stubby brown finger was placed against the artery in the old man's neck.
\par "Very weak," the Indian rasped.
\par Joao took another, closer look at this Indian, wondering at a sertao backwoodsman who behaved like a doctor.
\par "We've got to get him to a hospital," Joao said. "And his medicine in\'85"
\par "Hospital," the Indian agreed.
\par "Hospital?" asked the one with the flute.
\par A low, stridulant hissing came from the other Indian.
\par "Hospital," said the one with the flute.
\par That stridulant hissing! Joao stared at the Indian beside the Prefect. The sound had been reminiscent of the weird call that had echoed across the lawn.
\par The one with the flute poked him, said: "You will go into front and maneuver this\'85"
\par "Vehicle," said the one beside Joao's father.
\par "Vehicle," said the one with the flute.
\par "Hospital?" Joao pleaded.
\par "Hospital," agreed the one with the flute.
\par Joao looked once more to his father. The other Indian already was strapping the elder Martinho to the bench in preparation for movement. How competent the man appeared in spite of his backwoods look
\par "Obey," said the one with the flute.
\par Joao opened the door into the front compartment, slipped through, feeling the other one follow A few drops of rain spattered darkly against the curved windshield Joao squeeze
d into the operator's seat, noted how the Indian crouched behind him, flute pointed and ready
\par A dart gun of some kind, Joao guessed.
\par He punched the igniter button on the dash, strapped himself in while waiting for the turbines to build up speed The Indian 
still crouched behind him, vulnerable now if the airtruck were spun sharply. Joao flicked the communications switch on the lower left corner of the dash, looked into the tiny screen there giving him a view of the lab compartment. The rear doors were open.
 He closed them by hydraulic remote. His father was securely strapped to the bench now, Joao noted, but the other Indian was equally secured.
\par The turbines reached their whining peak. Joao switched on the lights, engaged the hydrostatic drive. The truck lift
ed six inches, angled upward as Joao increased pump displacement. He turned left onto the street, lifted another two meters to increase speed, headed toward the lights of a boulevard.
\par The Indian spoke beside his ear: "You will turn toward the mountain over there." A hand came forward, pointing to the right.
\par The Alejandro Clime is there in the foothills, Joao thought.
\par He made the indicated turn down a cross street angling toward the boulevard.
\par Casually, he gave pump displacement another boost, lifted another meter, and increased speed once more In the same motion, he switched on the intercom to the rear compartment, tuned for the spare amplifier and pickup in the compartment beneath the bench w
here his father lay.
\par The pickup, capable of making a dropped pin sound like a cannon, gave forth only a distant hissing and rasping. Joao increased amplification. The instrument should have been transmitting the old man's heartbeats now, sending a noticeabl
e drum-thump into the forward cabin.
\par There was nothing.
\par Tears blurred Joao's eyes, and he shook his head to clear them.
\par My father is dead, he thought. Killed by these crazy backwoodsmen
\par He noted in the dash screen that the Indian back there had a hand under the elder Martinho's back. The Indian appeared to be massaging the dead man's back, and a rhythmic rasping matched the motion.
\par Anger filled Joao. He felt like driving the airtruck into an abutment, dying himself to kill these crazy men.
\par They were approaching the outskirts of the city, and ring-girders circled off to the left giving access to the boulevard. This was an area of small gardens and cottages protected by over-fly canopies.
\par Joao lifted the airtruck above the canopies, headed toward the boulevard.
\par To the clinic, yes, he thought. But it is too late
\par In that instant, he realized there were no heartbeats at all coming from that rear compartment\emdash only the slow, rhythmic grating, a faint susurration, and a cicada-like hum up and down scale.
\par "To the mountains, there," said the Indian behind him.
\par Again, the hand came forward to point off to the right.
\par Joao, with that hand close to his eyes and illuminated by the dash, saw the scale-like parts of a finger shift position slightly. In that shift, he recognized the scale-shapes by their claw fringes.
\par The beetles'
\par The finger was composed of linked beetles working in unison!
\par Joao turned, stared into the Indian's eyes, seeing now why they glistened so: they were composed of thousands of tiny facets.
\par "Hospital, there," the creature beside him said, pointing.
\par Joao turned back to the controls, fighting to keep from losing composure. They were not Indians\'85 they weren't even human. They were insects\emdash some kind of hive-cluster shaped and organized to mimic a man.
\par The implications of this discovery raced through his mind. How did they support their weight? How did they feed and breathe?
\par How did they speak?
\par Everything had to be subordinated to the urgency of getting this information and proof of it back to one of the big labs where the facts could be explored.
\par Even the death of his father could not be considered now. He had to capture one of these things, get out with it
\par He reached overhead, flicked on the command transmitter, set its beacon for a homing call Let some of my Irmaos be awake and monitoring their sets, he prayed
\par "More to the right," said the creature behind him.
\par Again, Joao corrected course
\par The moon was high overhead now, illuminating a line of bandeirante towers off to the left. The first barrier.
\par They would be out of the green area soon and into the grey\emdash 
then, beyond that, another barrier and the great red that stretched out in reaching fingers through the Goyaz and the Mato Grosso Joao could see scattered lights of Resettlement Plan farms ahead, and darkness beyond.
\par The airtruck was going faster than he wanted, but Joao dared not slow it. They might become suspicious.
\par "You must go higher," said the creature behind him.
\par Joao increased pump displacement, raised the nose. He levelled off at three hundred meters.
\par More bandeirante towers loomed ahead, spaced at closer intervals. Joao picked up the barrier signals on his meters, looked back at the Indian The dissembler vibrations seemed not to affect the creature.
\par Joao looked out his side window and down. No one woul
d challenge him, he knew This was a bandeirante airtruck headed into the red zone . . and with its transmitter sending out a homing call. The men down there would assume he was a band leader headed out on a contract after a successful bid\emdash 
and calling his men to him for the job ahead.
\par He could see the moon-silvered snake of the Sao Francisco winding off to his left, and the lesser waterways like threads ravelled out of the foothills.
\par I must find the nest\emdash where we're headed, Joao thought. He wondered if he dared turn on his receiver\emdash but if his men started reporting in . . No. That could make the creatures suspect, they might take violent counter-action.
\par My men will realize something is wrong when I don't answer, he thought. They will follow.
\par If any of them hear my call.
\par Hours droned past.
\par Nothing but moonlighted jungle sped beneath them now, and the moon was low on the horizon, near setting. This was the deep red region where broadcast poisons had been used at first with disastrous results. This was where the w
ild mutations had originated It was here that Rhin Kelly had been reported missing.
\par This was the region being saved for the final assault, using a mobile barrier line when that line could be made short enough.
\par Joao armed the emergency charge that would separate the front and rear compartments of the truck where he fired it. The stub wings of the front compartment and its emergency rocket motors could get him back into bandeirante country.
\par With the specimen sitting behind him safely subdued, Joao hoped
\par He looked up through the canopy, scanned the horizon as far as he could. Was that moonlight glistening on a truck far back to the right? He couldn't be sure.
\par "How much farther?" Joao asked.
\par "Ahead," the creature rasped.
\par Now that he was alert for it, Joao heard the modulated stridulation beneath that voice.
\par "But how long?" Joao asked. "My father . ."
\par "Hospital for\'85 the father\'85 ahead," said the creature.
\par It would be dawn soon, Joao realized He could see the first false line of light along the horizon behind. This 
night had passed so swiftly. Joao wondered if these creatures had injected some time-distorting drug into him without his knowing. He thought not. He was maintaining himself in the necessities of the moment. There was no time for fatigue or boredom when h
e had to record every landmark half visible in the night, sense everything there was to sense about these creatures with him.
\par How did they coordinate all those separate parts?
\par They appeared conscious. Was that mimicry, too? What did they use for a brain?
\par Da
wn came, revealing the plateau of the Mato Grosso. Joao looked out his windows. This region, he knew, stretched across five degrees of latitude and six degrees of longitude. Once, it had been a region of isolated fazendas farmed by independent blacks and 
by sertanistos chained to the encomendero plantation system. It was hardwood jungles, narrow rivers with banks overgrown by lush trees and ferns, savannahs, and tangled life.
\par Even in this age it remained primitive, a fact blamed largely on insects and disease. It was one of the last strongholds of teeming insect life, if the International Ecological Organization's reports could be believed.
\par Supplies for the bandeirantes making the assault on this insect stronghold would come by way of Sao Paulo, by air and b
y transport on the multi-decked highways, then on antique diesel trains to Itapira, on river runners to Bahus and by airtruck to Registo and Leopoldina on the Araguaya.
\par This area crawled with insects: wire worms in the roots of the savannahs, grubs digging
 in the moist black earth, hopping beetles, dart-like angita wasps, chalcis flies, chiggers, sphecidae, braconidae, fierce hornets, white termites, hemipteric crawlers, blood roaches, thrips, ants, lice, mosquitoes, mites; moths, exotic butterflies, manti
dae\emdash and countless unnatural mutations of them all.
\par This would be an expensive fight\emdash unless it were stopped\emdash  because it already had been lost.
\par I mustn't think that way, Joao told himself. Out of respect for my father
\par Maps of the IEO showed this region in varied intensities of red. Around the red ran a ring of grey with pink shading where one or two persistent forms of insect life resisted man's poisons, jelly flames, astringents, sonitoxics\emdash 
the combination of flamant couroq and supersonics that drove insects from their hiding places into waiting death\emdash  and all the mechanical traps and lures in the bandeirante arsenal.
\par A grid map would be placed over this area and each thousand-acre square offered for bid to the independent bands to deinfest.
\par We bandeirantes are a kind of ultimate predator, Joao thought. It's no wonder these creatures mimic us.
\par But how good, really, was the mimicry? he asked himself. And how deadly to the predators?
\par "There," sad the creature behind him, and the multi-part hand came forward to point toward a black scarp visible ahead in the grey light of morning.
\par Joao's foot kicked a trigger on the floor releasing a great cloud of orange dye-fog beneath the truck to mark the ground and forest for a mile aro
und under this spot. As he kicked the trigger, Joao began counting down the five-second delay to the firing of the separation charge.
\par It came in a roaring blast that Joao knew would smear the creature behind him against the rear bulkhead. He sent the stub 
wings out, fed power to the rocket motors, and backed hard around. He saw the detached rear compartment settling slowly earthward above the dye cloud, its fall cushioned as the pumps of the hydrostatic drive automatically compensated.
\par I will come back, father, Joao thought. You will be buried among family and friends
\par He locked the controls, twisted in the seat to see what had happened to his captive.
\par A gasp escaped Joao's lips.
\par The rear bulkhead crawled with insects clustered around something white and puls
ing. The mud-grey shirt and trousers were torn, but insects already were repairing it, spinning out fibers that meshed and sealed on contact. There was a yellow sac-like extrusion near the pulsing white, and a dark brown skeleton with familiar articulatio
n.
\par It looked like a human skeleton\emdash but chitinous.
\par Before his eyes, the thing was reassembling itself, the long, furry antennae burrowing into the structure and interlocking.
\par The flute-weapon was not visible, and the thing's leather pouch had been thrown into a rear corner, but its eyes were in place in their brown sockets, staring at him. The mouth was reforming.
\par The yellow sac contracted, and a voice issued from the half-formed mouth.
\par "You must listen," it rasped.
\par Joao gulped, whirled back to the controls, unlocked them, and sent the cab into a wild, spinning turn.
\par A high-pitched rattling buzz sounded behind him. The noise seemed to pick up every bone in his body and shake it. Something crawled on his neck. He slapped at it, felt it squash.
\par All Joao could th
ink of was escape. He stared frantically out at the earth beneath, seeing a blotch of white in a savannah off to his right and, in the same instant, recognizing another airtruck banking beside him, the insignia of his own Irmandades band bright on its sid
e.
\par The white blotch in the savannah was resolving itself into a cluster of tents with an IEO orange and green banner flying beside them.
\par Joao dove for the tents, praying the other airtruck would follow.
\par Something stung his cheek. They were in his hair\emdash bitin
g, stinging. He stabbed the braking rockets, aimed for open ground about fifty meters from the tents. Insects were all over the inside of the glass now, blocking his vision. Joao said a silent prayer, hauled back on the control arm, felt the cab mush out,
 touch ground, skidding and slewing across the savannah. He kicked the canopy release before the cab stopped, broke the seal on his safety harness, and launched himself up and out to land, sprawling in grass.
\par He rolled through the grass, feeling the insects
 bite like fire over every exposed part of his body. Hands grabbed him and he felt a jelly hood splash across his face to protect it. A voice he recognized as Thome of his own band said: "This way, Johnny! Run!" They ran.
\par He heard a spraygun fire: "Whooosh!"
\par And again.
\par And again.
\par Arms lifted him and he felt a leap.
\par They landed in a heap and a voice said, "Mother of God! Would you look at that!"
\par Joao clawed the jelly hood from his face, sat up to stare across the savannah. The grass seethed and boiled with insects around the uptilted cab and the airtruck that had landed beside it.
\par Joao looked around him, counted seven of his Irmaos with Thome, his chief sprayman, in command.
\par Beyond them clustered five other people, a red-haired woman slightly in front, half turned to look at the savannah and at him. He recognized the woman immediately: Dr. Rhin Kelly of the IEO. When they had met in the A' Chigua n
ightclub in Bahia, she had seemed exotic and desirable to Joao. Now, she wore a field uniform instead of gown and jewels, and her eyes held no invitation at all.
\par "I see a certain poetic justice in this\'85 traitors," she said.
\par Joao lifted himself to his feet,
 took a cloth proffered by one of his men, wiped off the last of the jelly. He felt hands brushing him, clearing dead insects off his coveralls. The pain of his skin was receding under the medicant jelly, and now he found himself dominated by puzzled ques
tioning as he recognized the mood of the IEO personnel.
\par They were furious and it was directed at him\'85 and at his fellow Irmandades.
\par Joao studied the woman, noting how her green eyes glared at him, the pink flush to her skin.
\par "Dr. Kelly?" Joao said.
\par "If it isn't Joao Martinho, jefe of the Irmandades," she said, "the traitor of the Piratininga."
\par "They are crazy, that is the only thing, I think," said Thome.
\par "Your pets turned on you, didn't they?" she demanded. "And wasn't that inevitable?"
\par "Would you be so kind as to explain," Joao said.
\par "I don't need to explain," she said. "Let your friends out there explain." She pointed toward the rim of jungle beyond the savannah.
\par Joao looked where she pointed, saw a line of men in bandeirante white standing untouched amids
t the leaping, boiling insects in the jungle shadow. He took a pair of binoculars from around the neck of one of his men, focused on the figures. Knowing what to look for made the identification easy.
\par "Tommy," Joao said.
\par His chief sprayman, Thome, bent close, rubbing at an insect sting on his swarthy cheek.
\par In a low voice, Joao explained what the figures at the jungle edge were.
\par "Aieee," Thome said.
\par An Irmandade on Joao's left crossed himself.
\par "What was it we leaped across corning in here?" Joao asked.
\par "A ditch," Thome said. "It seems to be filled with couroq jelly\'85 an insect barrier of some kind."
\par Joao nodded. He began to have unpleasant suspicions about their position here. He looked at Rhin Kelly. "Dr. Kelly, where are the rest of your people? Surely there are more than five in an IEO field crew."
\par Her lips compressed, but she remained silent.
\par "So?" Joao glanced around at the tents, seeing their weathered condition. "And where is your equipment, your trucks and lab huts and jitneys?"
\par "Funny thing you should ask," she said, but there was uncertainty atop the sneering quality of her voice. "About a kilometer into the trees over there\'85" she nodded to her left, "\'85 is a wrecked jungle truck containing most of our\'85
 equipment, as you call it. The track spools of our truck were eaten away by acid."
\par "Acid?"
\par "It smelled like oxalic," said one of her companions, a blonde Nordic with a scar beneath his right eye.
\par "Start from the beginning," Joao said.
\par "We were cut off here almost six weeks ago," said the blonde man. "Something got our radio, our truck\emdash they looked like giant chiggers and they can shoot an acid spray about fifteen meters."
\par "There's a glass case containing three dead specimens in my lab tent," said Dr. Kelly.
\par Joao pursed his lips, thinking. "So?"
\par "I heard part of what you were telling your men there," she said. "Do you expect us to believe that?"
\par "It is of no importance to me what you believe," Joao said. "How did you get here?"
\par "We fought our way in here from the truck using caramuru cold-fire spray," said the blonde man. "We dragged along what supplies we could, dug a trench around our perimeter, poured in the couroq powder, and topped it off with all our copahu oil\'85
 and here we sat."
\par "How many of you?" Joao asked.
\par "There were fourteen of us," said the man.
\par Joao rubbed the back of his neck where the insect stings were again beginning to burn. He glanced around at his men, assessing their condition and equipment, counted four spray rifles, saw the men carried spare charge cylinders on slings around their 
necks.
\par "The airtruck will take us," he said. "We had better get out of here."
\par Dr. Kelly looked out to the savannah, said: "I think it has been too late for that since a few seconds after you landed, bandeirante. I think in a day or so there'll be a few less traitors around. You're caught in your own trap."
\par Joao whirled to stare at the airtruck, barked: "Tommy! Vince! Get
\par \'85" He broke off as the airtruck sagged to its left.
\par "It's only fair to warn you," said Dr. Kelly, "to stay away from the edge of the ditch unless you first spray the opposite side. They can shoot a stream of acid at least fifteen meters\'85 and as you can see\'85" she nodded toward the airtruck, "\'85
 the acid eats metal."
\par "You're insane," Joao said. "Why didn't you warn us immediately?"
\par "Warn you?"
\par Her blonde companion said: "Rhin, perhaps we\'85"
\par "Be quiet, Hogar," she said, and turned back to Joao. "We lost nine men to your playmates." She looked at the small band of Irmandades. "Our lives are little enough to pay now for the extinction of eight of you\'85 traitors."
\par "You are insane," Joao said.
\par "Stop playing innocent, bandeirante," she said. "We have seen your companions out there. We have seen the new playmates you bred\'85 and we understand that you were too greedy; now your game has gotten out of hand."
\par "You've not seen my Irmaos doing these things," Joao said. He looked at Thome. "Tommy, keep an eye on these insane ones." He lifted the spray rifle from one of his men, took the man's spare charges, indicated the other three armed men. "You\emdash 
come with me."
\par "Johnny, what do you do?" Thome asked.
\par "Salvage the supplies from the truck," Joao said. He walked toward the ditch nearest the airtruck, laid down a hard mist of foamal beyond the ditch, beckoned the others to follow, and leaped the ditch.
\par Little more than an hour later, with all of them acid burned\emdash two seriously\emdash the Irmandades retreated back across the ditch. They had salvaged less than a fourth of the equipment in the truck, and this did not include a transmitter.
\par "It is evident the little devils went first for the communications equipment," Thome said. "How could they tell?"
\par Joao said: "I do not want to guess." He broke open a first aid box, began treating his men. One had a cheek and shoulder badly splashed with acid. Another was losing flesh off his back.
\par Dr. Kelly came up, helped him treat the men, but refused to speak, even to answering the simplest question.
\par Finally, Joao touched up a spot on his own arm, neutralizing the acid and covering the burn with fleshtape. He gritted his teeth against the pain, stared at Rhin Kelly. "Where are these chigua you found?"
\par "Go find them yourself!" she snapped.
\par "You are a blind, unprincipled megalomaniac," Joao said, speaking in an even voice. "Do not push me too far."
\par Her face went pale and the green eyes blazed.
\par Joao grabbed her arm, hauled her roughly toward the tents. "Show me these chigua!"
\par She jerked free of him, threw back her red hair, stared at him defiantly. Joao faced her, looked her up and down with a calculating slowness.
\par "Go ahead, do violence to me," she said. "I'm sure I couldn't stop you."
\par "You act like a woman who wants\'85 needs violence," Joao said. "Would you like me to turn you over to my men? They're a little tired of your raving."
\par Her face flamed. "You would not dare!"
\par "Don't be so melodramatic," he said. "I wouldn't give you the pleasure. "
\par "You insolent\'85 you\'85"
\par Joao showed her a wolfish grin, said: "Nothing you say will make me turn you over to my men!"
\par "Johnny."
\par It was Thome calling.
\par Joao turned, saw Thome talking to the Nordic IEO man who had volunteered information. What had she called him? Hogar.
\par Thome beckoned.
\par Joao crossed to the pair, bent close as Thome signaled secrecy.
\par "The gentleman here says the female doctor was bitten by an insect that got past their barrier's fumes."
\par "Two weeks ago," Hogar whispered.
\par "She has not been the same since," Thome said. "We humor her, jefe, no?"
\par Joao wet his lips with his tongue. He felt suddenly dizzy and too warm.
\par "The insect that bit her was similar to the ones that were on you," Hogar said, and his voice sounded apologetic.
\par They are making fun of me! Joao thought.
\par "I give the orders here!" he snapped.
\par "Yes, jefe," Thome said. "But you\'85"
\par "What difference does it make who gives the orders?"
\par It was Dr. Kelly close behind him.
\par Joao turned, glared at her. How hateful she looked\'85 in spite of her beauty.
\par "What's the difference?" she demanded. "We'll all be dead in a few days anyway." She stared out across the savannah. "More of your friends have arrived."
\par Joao looked to the forest shadow, saw more human-like figures arriving. They appeared familiar and he wondered what it was\emdash 
 something at the edge of his mind, but his head hurt. Then he realized they looked like sertao Indians, like the pair who had lured him here. There were at least a hundred of them, apparently identical in every visible respect.
\par More were arriving by the second.
\par Each of them carried a qena flute.
\par There was something about the flutes that Joao felt he should remember.
\par Another figure came advancing through the Indians, a thin man in a black suit, his hair shiny silver in the sunlight.
\par "Father!" Joao gasped.
\par I'm sick, he thought.I must be delirious.
\par "That looks like the Prefect," Thome said. "Is it not so, Ramon?"
\par The Irmandade he addressed said: "If it is not the Prefect, it is his twin. Here, Johnny. Look with the glasses."
\par Joao took the glasses, focused on the figure advancing toward them through the grass. The glasses felt so heavy. They trembled in his hands and the figure coming toward them was blurred.
\par "I cannot see!" Joao muttered and he almost dropped the glasses.
\par A hand steadied him, and he realized he was reeling.
\par In an instant of clarity, he saw that the line of Indians had raised their flutes, pointing to the IEO camp. That buzzing-rasping that had shaken his bones in the airtruck cab filled the universe around him. He saw his companions begin to fall.
\par In the instant before his world went blank, Joao heard his father's voice calling strongly: "Joao! Do not resist! Put down your weapons!"
\par The trampled grassy earth of the campsite, Joao saw, was coming up to meet his face.
\par It cannot be my father, Joao thought. My father is dead and they've copied him\'85 mimicry, nothing more.
\par Darkness.
\par There was a dream of being carried, a dream of tears and shouting, a dream of violent protests and defiance and rejection.
\par He awoke to yellow-orange light and the figure who could not be his father bending over him, thrusting a hand out, saying: "Then examine my hand if you don't believe!"
\par But Joao's attention was on a face behind his father. It was a giant face, baleful in the strange light, its eyes bri
lliant and glaring with pupils within pupils. The face turned, and Joao saw it was no more than two centimeters thick. Again, it turned, and the eyes focused on Joao's feet.
\par Joao forced himself to look down, began trembling violently as he saw he was half enveloped in a foaming green cocoon, that his skin shared some of the same tone.
\par "Examine my hand!" ordered the old-man figure beside him.
\par "He has been dreaming." It was a resonant voice that boomed all around him, seemingly coming from beneath the giant face. "He has been dreaming," the voice repeated. "He is not quite awake."
\par With an abrupt, violent motion, Joao reached out, clutched the proffered hand.
\par It felt warm\'85 human.
\par For no reason he could explain, tears came to Joao's eyes.
\par "Am I dreaming?" he whispered. He shook his head to clear away the tears.
\par "Joao, my son," said his father's voice.
\par Joao looked up at the familiar face. It was his father and no mistake. "But\'85 your heart," Joao said.
\par "My pump," the old man said. "Look." And he pulled his hand away, turned to display where the back of his black suit had been cut away, its edges held by some gummy substance, and a pulsing surface of oily yellow between those cut edges.
\par Joao saw the hair-fine scale lines, the multiple shapes, and he recoiled.
\par So it was a copy, another of their tricks.
\par The old man turned back to face him. "The old pump failed and they gave me a new one," he said. "It shares my blood and lives off me and it'll give me a few more years. What do you think our bright IEO specialists will say about the usefulness of that?"

\par "Is it really you?" Joao demanded.
\par "All except the pump," said the old man. "They had to give you and some of the others a whole new blood system because of all the corrosive poison that got into you."
\par Joao lifted his hands, stared at them.
\par "They know medical tricks we haven't even dreamed about," the old man said. "I haven't been this excited since I was a boy. I can hardly wait to get back and\'85 Joao! What is it?"
\par Joao was thrusting himself up, glaring at the old man. "We're not human anymore if\'85 We're not human!"
\par "Be still, son!" the old man ordered.
\par "If this is true," Joao protested, "they're in control." He nodded toward the giant face behind his father. "They'll rule us!"
\par He sank back, gasping. "We'll be their slaves."
\par "Foolishness," rumbled the drum voice.
\par Joao looked at the giant face, growing aware of the fluorescent insects above it, seeing that the insects clung to the ceiling of a cave, noting finally a patch of night sky and stars where the fluorescent insects ended.
\par "What is a slave?" rumbled the voice.
\par Joao looked beneath the face where the voice originated, saw a white mass about four meters across, a pulsing yellow sac protruding from it, insects cr
awling over it, into fissures along its surface, back to the ground beneath. The face appeared to be held up from that white mass by dozens of round stalks, their scaled surfaces betraying their nature.
\par "Your attention is drawn to our way of answering your threat to us," rumbled the voice, and Joao saw that the sound issued from the pulsing yellow sac. "This is our brain. It is vulnerable, very vulnerable, weak, yet strong\'85
 just as your brain. Now, tell me, what is a slave?"
\par Joao fought down a shiver of revulsion, said: "I'm a slave now; I'm in bondage to you."
\par "Not true," rumbled the voice. "A slave is one who must produce wealth for another, and there is only one true wealth in all the universe\emdash living time. Are we slaves because we have given your father more time to live?"
\par Joao looked up to the giant, glittering eyes, thought he detected amusement there.
\par "The lives of all those with you have been spared or extended as well," drummed the voice. "That makes us your slaves, does it not?"
\par "What do you take in return?"
\par "Ah, hah!" the voice fairly barked. "Quid pro quo! You are, indeed, our slaves as well. We are tied to each other by a bond of mutual slavery that cannot be broken\emdash never could be."
\par "It is very simple once you understand it," Joao's father said.
\par "Understand what?"
\par "Some of our kind once lived in greenhouses and their cells remembered the experience," rumbled the voice. "You know about greenhouses, of course?" It turned to look out at the cave mouth where dawn was beginning to touch the world with gr
ey. "That out there, that is a greenhouse, too." Again, it looked down at Joao, the giant eyes glaring. "To sustain life, a greenhouse must achieve a delicate balance\emdash 
enough of this chemical, enough of that one, another substance available when needed. What is poison one day can be sweet food the next."
\par "What's all this to do with slavery?" Joao demanded.
\par "Life has developed over millions of years in this greenhouse we call Earth," the voice rumbled. "Sometimes it developed in the poison excrement of other life\'85
 and then that poison became necessary to it. Without a substance produced by the wire worm, that savannah grass out there would die\'85 in time. Without substances produced by
\par \'85 insects, your kind of life would die. Sometimes, just a
 faint trace of the substance is needed, such as the special copper compound produced by the arachnids. Sometimes, the substance must subtly change each time before it can be used by a life form at the end of the chain. The more different forms of life th
ere are, the more life the greenhouse can support. This is the lesson of the greenhouse. The successful greenhouse must grow many times many forms of life. The more forms of life it has, the healthier it is."
\par "You're saying we have to stop killing insects," Joao said. "You're saying we have to let you take over."
\par "We say you must stop killing yourselves," rumbled the voice. "Already, the Chinese are\'85 I believe you would call it reinfesting their land. Perhaps they will be in time, perhaps not. Here, it is not too late. There\'85 they were fast and thorough\'85
 and they may need help."
\par "You\'85 give us no proof," Joao said.
\par "There will be time for proof, later," said the voice. "Now, join your woman friend outside; let the sun work on your skin and the chlorophyll in your blood, and when you come back, tell me if the sun is your slave."

\par 
\par There must be a streak of madness in a Slorin who'd bring his only offspring, an untrained and untried youth, on a mission as potentially dangerous as this one, Smeg told himself.
\par The rationale behind his decision remained clear: The colonial nucleus must preserve its elders for their detail memory. The youngest of the group was the logical one to be volunteered for this risk. Still ...
\par Smeg forced such thoughts out of his mind. They weakened him. He concentrated on driving the gray motor-pool Plymouth they'd signed out of the government garage in the state capital that morning. The machine demanded considerable attention.
\par The Plymouth was only two years old, but this region's 
red rock roads and potholes had multiplied those years by a factor of at least four. The steering was loose and assorted squeaks arose from front and rear as he negotiated a rutted down-grade. The road took them into a shadowed gulch almost bare of vegeta
tion and across the rattling planks of a wooden bridge that spanned a dry creekbed. They climbed out the other side through ancient erosion gullies, past a rone of scrub cottonwoods and onto the reaching flat land they'd been crossing for two hours.

\par Smeg ri
sked a glance at Rick, his offspring, riding silently beside him. The youth had come out of the pupal stage with a passable human shape. No doubt Rick would do better next time - provided he had the opportunity. But he was well within the seventy-five per
cent accuracy limit the Slorin set for themselves. It was a universal fact that the untrained sentience saw what it }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid2515399 thought }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid2515399 
it saw. The mind tended to supply the missing elements.
\par A nudge from the Slorin mind-cloud helped, of course, but this carried its ow
n perils. The nudged mind sometimes developed powers of its own - with terrifying results. Slorin had learned long ago to depend on the directional broadcast of the mind's narrow band, and to locate themselves in a network limited by the band's rather sho
rt range.
\par However, Rick had missed none of the essentials for human appearance. He had a gentle, slender face whose contours were difficult to remember. His brown eyes were of a limpid softness that made human females discard all suspicions while the males 
concentrated on jealousy. Rick's hair was a coarse, but acceptable black. The shoulders were a bit high and the thorax somewhat too heroic, but the total effect aroused no probing questions.
\par That was the important thing: no probing questions.
\par Smeg permitted himself a silent sigh. His own shape - that of a middle-aged government official, gray at the temples, slightly paunchy and bent of shoulder, and with weak eyes behind gold-rimmed glasses - was more in the Slorin tradition.

\par In other words, don't do what they were doing today.
\par Awareness of danger forced Smeg into extreme contact with this body his plastic genes had fashioned. It was a good body, a close enough duplicate to interbreed wit
h the natives, but he felt it now from the inside, as it were, a fabric of newness stretched over the ancient substance of the Slorin. It was familiar, yet bothersomely unfamiliar.

s, each addition to my name an honor to my family. By the pupa of my jelly-sire whose name took fourteen thousand heartbeats to pronounce, I shall not fail!}{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid2515399 
\par There! That was the spirit he needed - the eternal wanderer, temporarily disciplined, yet without boundaries. 'If you want to swim, you must enter the water,' he whispered.
\par 
\par 'Did you say something, Dad?' Rick asked.
\par Ahhh, that was very good, Smeg thought. Dad - the easy colloquialism.
\par 'I was girding myself for the ordeal, so to speak,' Smeg said. 'We must separate in a few minutes.' He nodded ahead to where a town was beginning to hump itself out of the horizon.
\par 'I think I should barge right in and start asking about their sheriff,' Rick said.
\par Smeg drew in a sharp breath, a gesture of surprise that fitted this body. 'Feel out the situation first,' he said.
\par More and more, he began to question the wisdom of sending Rick in there. Dangerous, damnably dangerous. Rick could get himself irrevocably killed, ruined beyond the pupa's powers to restore. Worse than 
that, he could be exposed. There was the real danger. Give natives the knowledge of what they were fighting and they tended to develop extremely effective methods.
\par Slorin memory carried a bagful of horror stories to verify this fact.
\par 'The Slorin must remain ready to take any shape, adapt to any situation,' Rick said. 'That it!'
\par Rick spoke the axiom well, Smeg thought, but did he really understand it? How could he? Rick still didn't have full control of the behavior patterns that went with this particular bo
dy shape. Again, Smeg sighed. If only they'd saved the infiltration squad, the expendable specialists.
\par Thoughts such as this always brought the more disquieting question: }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid2515399 Saved them from what?}{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid2515399 
\par There had been five hundred pupae in the }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid2515399 Scattership }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid2515399 before the
 unknown disaster. Now there were four secondary ancestors and one new offspring created on this planet. They were shipless castaways on an unregistered world, not knowing even the nature of the disaster which had sent them scooting across the void in an 
escape capsule with minimum shielding.
\par Four of them had emerged from the capsule as basic Slorin poly-morphs to find themselves in darkness on a steep landscape of rocks and trees. At morning, there'd been four additional trees there - watching, listening, 
weighing the newness against memories accumulated across a timespan in which billions of planets such as this one could have developed and died.
\par The capsule had chosen an excellent landing site: no nearby sentient constructions. The Slorin now knew the reg
ion's native label - central British Columbia. In that period of awakening, though, it had been a place of unknown dangers whose chemistry and organization required the most cautious testing.
\par In time, four black bears had shambled down out of the mountains
. Approaching civilization, they'd hidden and watched - listening, always listening, never daring to use the mindcloud. Who knew what mental powers the natives might have? Four roughly fashioned hunters had been metamorphosed from Slorin pupae in a brush-
screened cave. The hunters had been tested, refined.
\par Finally - the hunters had scattered.
\par Slorin always scattered.
\par 
\par 'When we left Washington you said something about the possibility of a trap,' Rick said. 'You don't really think -'
\par 'Slorin have been unmasked on some worlds,' Smeg said. 'Natives have developed situational protective devices. This has some of the characteristics of such a trap.'
\par 'Then why investigate? Why not leave it alone until we're stronger?'
\par 'Rick!' Smeg shuddered at the youth's massive ignorance. 'Other capsules may have escaped,' he said.
\par 'But if it's a Slorin down here, he's acting like a dangerous fool.'
\par 'More reason to investigate. We could have a damaged pupa here, one who lost part of the detail memory. Perhaps he doesn't know how to act - except out of instincts.'
\par 'Then why not stay out of the town and probe just a little bit with the mindcloud?'
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid2515399 Rick cannot be trusted with this job, }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid2515399 Smeg thought. }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid2515399 He's too raw, too full of the youthful desire to play with the mindcloud.}{
\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid2515399 
\par 'Why not?' Rick repeated.
\par Smeg pulled the car to a stop at the side of the dirt road, opened his window. It was getting hot - be noon in about an hour. The landscape was a hardscrabble flatness marked by sparse vegetation
 and a clump of buildings about two miles ahead. Broken fences lined both sides of the road. Low cottonwoods off to the right betrayed the presence of the dry creekbed. Two scrofulous oaks in the middle distance provided shade for several steers. Away on 
the rim of the batland, obscured by haze, there was a suggestion of hills.
\par 'You going to try my suggestion?' Rick asked.
\par 'No.'
\par 'Then why're we stopping? This as far as you go?'
\par 'No.' Smeg sighed. 'This is as far as }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid2515399 you }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid2515399 go. I'm changing plans. You will wait. I will go into the village.'
\par 'But I'm the younger. I'm - '
\par 'And I'm in command here.'
\par 'The others won't like this. They said -'
\par 'The others will understand my decision.'
\par 'But Slorin law says -'
\par 'Don't quote Slorin law to me!'
\par 'But-'
\par 'Would you teach your 
grandfather how to shape a pupa?' Smeg shook his head. Rick must learn how to control the anger which flared in this bodily creation. 'The limit of the law is the limit of enforcement - the real limit of organized society. We're not an organized society. 
We're two Slorin - alone, cut off from our pitiful net. Alone! Two Slorin of widely disparate ability. You are capable of carrying a message. I do not judge you capable of meeting the challenge in this village.'
\par Smeg reached across Rick, opened the door.
\par 'This is a firm decision?' Rick asked.
\par 'It is. You know what to do?'
\par Rick spoke stiffly: 'I take that kit of yours from the back and I play the part of a soil engineer from the Department of Agriculture.'
\par 'Not a }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid2515399 part, }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid2515399 Rick. You }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid2515399 are }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid2515399 a soil engineer.'
\par 'But-'
\par 'You will make real tests which will go into a real report and be sent to a real office with a real function. In the event of disaster, you will assume my shape and step into my niche.'
\par 'I see.'
\par 'I truly hope you do. Meanwhile, you will go out across that field. }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 The dry creekbed is out there. See those cottonwoods?'
\par 'I've identified the characteristics of this landscape.'
\par 'Excellent. Don't deviate. Remember that you're the offspring of Sumctroxelunsmeg. Your jelly-sire's name took fourteen thousand heartbeats to pronounce. Live with pride.'
\par 'I was supposed to go in there, take the risk of it -'
\par 'There are risks and there are risks. Remember, make real tests for a real report. Never betray your niche. When you have made the tests, find a place 
in that creekbed to secrete yourself. Dig in and wait. Listen on the narrow band at all times. Listen, that is all you do. In the event of disaster, you must get word to the others. In the kit there's a dog collar with a tag bearing a promise of reward an
d the address of our Chicago drop. Do you know the greyhound shape?'
\par 'I know the plan, Dad.'
\par Rick slid out of the car. He removed a heavy black case from the rear, closed the doors, stared in at his parent.
\par Smeg leaned across the seat, opened the window. It creaked dismally.
\par 'Good luck, Dad,' Rick said.
\par Smeg swallowed. This body carried a burden of attachment to an offspring much stronger than any in previous Slorin experience. He wondered how the offspring felt about the parent, tried to probe his own feeli
ngs toward the one who'd created him, trained him, sealed his pupa into the }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 Scattership. }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 There was no sense of loss. In some ways, he }{
\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 was }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 
the parent. As different experiences changed him, he would become more and more the individual, however. Syllables would be added to his name. Perhaps, someday, he might feel an urge to be reunited.
\par 'Don't lose your cool, Dad,' Rick said.
\par 'The God of the Slorin has no shape,' Smeg said. He closed the window, straightened himself behind the steering wheel.
\par Rick turned, trudged off across the field toward the cotton-woods. A low cloud of dust marked his progress. He carried the black case easily in his right hand.
\par Smeg put the car in motion, concentrated on driving. That last glimpse of Rick, sturdy and obedient, had pierced him with unexpected emotions. Slorin parted, he told himself. It is natural for Slorin to part. An offspring is merely an offspring.
\par A Slorin prayer came into his mind: 'Lord, let me possess this moment without regrets and, losing it, gain it forever.'
\par The prayer helped, but Smeg still felt the tug of that parting. He stared at the shabby buildings of his target town. Someone in this collection of structures Smeg was now entering had not learned a basic Slorin lesson: }{
\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 There is a reason for living; Slorin must not live in a way that destroys this reason. }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 Moderation, that was the key.
\par 
\par A man stood in the dusty sunglare toward the center of the
 town - one lone man beside the dirt road that ran unchecked toward the distant horizon. For one haunted moment Smeg had the feeling it was not a man, but a dangerous other-shaped enemy he'd met before. The feeling passed as Smeg brought the car to a stop
 nearby.
\par Here was the American peasant, Smeg realized - tall, lean, dressed in wash-faded blue bib overalls, a dirty tan shirt and tennis shoes. The shoes were coming apart to reveal bare toes. A ground green painter's hat with green plastic visor did an in
effective job of covering his yellow hair. The visor's rim was cracked. It dripped a fringe of ragged binding that swayed when the man moved his head.
\par Smeg leaned out his window, smiled: 'Howdy.'
\par 'How do.'
\par Smeg's sense of hearing, trained in a history of billions of such encounters, detected the xenophobia and reluctant bowing to convention at war in the man's voice.
\par 'Town's pretty quiet,' Smeg said.
\par 'Yep.'
\par Purely human accents, Smeg decided. He permitted himself to relax somewhat, asked: 'Anything unusual ever happen around here?'
\par 'You fum the gov'ment?'
\par 'That's right.' Smeg tapped the motor-pool insignia on his door. 'Department of Agriculture.'
\par 'Then you ain't part of the gov'ment conspiracy?'
\par 'Conspiracy?' Smeg studied the man for a clue to hidden meanings. Was this one of those southern towns where anything from the government just had to be communist?
\par 'Guess you ain't,' the man said.
\par 'Of course not.'
\par 'That there was a serious question you asked, then ... about unusual thing happening?'
\par 'I ... yes.'
\par 'Depends on what you call unusual.'
\par 'What ... do }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 you }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 call unusual?' Smeg ventured.
\par 'Can't rightly say. And you?'
\par Smeg frowned, leaned out his window, looked up and down the street, studied each deta
il: the dog sniffing under the porch of a building labeled 'General Store,' the watchful blankness of windows with here and there a twitching curtain to betray someone peering out, the missing boards on the side of a gas station beyond the store - one rus
t
y pump there with its glass chamber empty. Every aspect of the town spoke of heat-addled somnolence ... yet it was wrong. Smeg could feel tensions, transient emotional eddies that irritated his highly tuned senses. He hoped Rick already had a hiding place
 and was listening.
\par 'This is Wadeville, isn't it?' Smeg asked.
\par 'Yep. Used to be county seat 'fore the war.'
\par He meant the War Between The States, Smeg realized, recalling his studies of regional history. As always, the Slorin were using every spare moment to
 absorb history, mythology, arts, literature, science - You never knew which might be the valuable piece of information.
\par 'Ever hear about someone could get right into your mind?' the man asked.
\par Smeg overcame a shock reaction, groped for the proper response. Amused disbelief, he decided, and managed a small chuckle. 'That the unusual thing you have around here?'
\par 'Didn't say yes; didn't say no.'
\par 'Why'd you ask then?' Smeg knew his voice sounded like crinkling bread wrapper. He pulled his head back into the car's shadows.
\par 'I jes' wondered if you might be hunting fer a teleepath?'
\par The man turned, hawked a cud of tobacco toward the dirt at his left. A vagrant breeze caught the spittle, draped it across the side of Smeg's car.
\par 'Oh, dang!' the man said. He produced a dirty yellow bandanna, knelt and scrubbed with it at the side of the car.
\par 
\par Smeg leaned out, studied this performance with an air of puzzlement. The man's responses, the vague hints at mental powers -they were confusing, fitted no pattern in Slorin experience.
\par 'You got somebody around here claiming to be a telepath?' Smeg asked.
\par 'Can't say.' The man stood up, peered in at Smeg. 'Sorry about that there. Wind, you know. Accident. Didn't mean no harm.'
\par 'Certainly.'
\par 'Hope you won't say nothing to the sheriff. Got 'er all cleaned off your car now. Can't tell where I hit 'er.'
\par The man's voice carried a definite tone of fear, Smeg realized. He stared at this American peasant with a narrow, searching gaze. }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 Sheriff, }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 
he'd said. Was it going to be this easy? Smeg wondered how to capitalize on that opening. Sheriff. Here was an element of the mystery they'd come to investigate.
\par As the silence drew out, the man said: 'Got 'er all clean. You can get out and look for yourself.'
\par 'I'm sure you did, Mr ... ahhh ... '
\par 'Painter, Josh'a Painter. Most folks call me Josh on account of my first name there, Josh'a Painter.'
\par 'Pleased to meet you, Mr Painter. My name's Smeg, Henry Smeg.'
\par 'Smeg,' Painter said with a musing tone. 'Don't rightly believe I ever heard that name before.'
\par 'It used to be much longer,' Smeg said. 'Hungarian.'
\par 'Oh.'
\par 'I'm curious, Mr Painter, why you'd be afraid I might tell the sheriff because the wind blew a little tobacco juice on my car?'
\par 'Never can tell how some folks'll take things,' Painter said. He looked from one end of Smeg's car to the other, back to Smeg. 'You a gov'ment man, this car an' all, reckoned I'd best be sure, one sensible man to another.'
\par 'You've been having trouble with the government around here, is that it?'
\par 'Don't take kindly to most gov'ment men hereabouts, we don't. But the sheriff, he don't allow us to do anything about that. Sheriff is a mean man, a certain mean man sometimes, and he's got my Barton.'
\par 'Your barton,' Smeg said, drawing back into the car to conceal his puzzlement. }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 Barton? }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 
This was an entirely new term. Strange that none of them had encountered it before. Their study of languages and dialects had been most thorough. Smeg began to feel uneasy about his entire conversation wi
th this Painter. The conversation had never really been under control. He wondered how much of it he'd actually understood. There was in Smeg a longing to venture a mindcloud probe, to nudge the man's motives, make him }{
\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 want }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 to explain.
\par 'You one of them survey fellows like we been getting?' Painter asked.
\par 'You might say that,' Smeg said. He straightened his shoulders. 'I'd like to walk around and look at your town, Mr Painter. May I leave my car here?'
\par ' 'Tain't in the way that I can see,' Painter said. He managed to appear both interested and disinterested in Smeg's question. His glance flicked sideways, all around - at the car, the road, at a house behind a privet hedge across the way.
\par 'Fine,' Smeg said. He got out, slammed the door, reached into the back for the flat-crowned western hat he affected in these parts. It tended to break down some barriers.
\par 'You forgetting your papers?' Painter asked.
\par 'Papers?' Smeg turned, looked at the man.
\par 'Them papers full of questions you gov'ment people all us use.'
\par 'Oh.' Smeg shook his head. 'We can forget about papers today.'
\par 'You jes' going to wander around?' Painter asked.
\par 'That's right.'
\par 'Well, some folks'll talk to you,' Painter said. 'Got all kinds of different folks here.' He turned away, started to walk off.
\par 'Please, just a minute,' Smeg said.
\par Painter stopped as though he'd run into a barrier, spoke without turning. 'You want something?'
\par 'Where're you going, Mr Painter?'
\par 'Jes' down the road a piece.'
\par 'I'd ... ahhh, hoped you might guide me,' Smeg said. 'That is if you haven't anything better to do?'
\par Painter turned, stared at him. 'Guide? In Wadeville?' He looked around him, back to Smeg. A tiny smile tugged at his mouth.
\par 'Well, where do I find your sheriff, for instance?' Smeg asked.
\par The smile disappeared. 'Why'd you want him?'
\par 'Sheriffs usually know a great deal about an area.'
\par 'You sure you actual' want to see him?'
\par 'Sure. Where's his office?'
\par 'Well now, Mr Smeg ... ' Painter hesitated, then: 'His office is just around the corner here, next the bank.'
\par 'Would you show me?' Smeg moved forward, his feet kicking up dust puddles in the street. 'Which corner?}{\fs20\super\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 '
\par '}{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 This'n right here.' Painter pointed to a field stone building at his left. A weed-grown lane led off past it. The corner of a wooden porch jutted from the stone building into the lane.
\par 
\par Smeg walked past Painter, peered down the lane. Tufts of grass grew in the middle and along both sides, green runners stretching all through the area. Smeg doubted that a wheeled vehicle had been down this way in two years - possibly longer.
\par A row of objects on the porch caught his attention. He moved closer, studied them, turned back to Painter.
\par 'What're all those bags and packages on that porch?'
\par 'Them?' Painter came up beside Smeg, stood a moment, lips pursed, eyes focused beyond the porch.
\par 'Well, what are they?' Smeg pressed.
\par 'This here's the bank.' Painter said. 'Them's night deposits.'
\par Smeg turned back to the porch. Night deposits? Paper bags and fabric sacks left out in the open?
\par 'People leaves 'em here if'n the bank ain't open,' Painter said. 'Bank's a little late opening today. Sheriff had 'em in looking at the books last night.'
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 Sheriff examining the bank's books? }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 Smeg wondered. He hoped Rick was missing none of 
this and could repeat it accurately ... just in case. The situation here appeared far more mysterious than the reports had indicated. Smeg didn't like the feeling of this place at all.
\par 'Makes it convenient for people who got to get up early and them that collects their money at night,' Painter explained.
\par 'They just leave it right put in the open?' Smeg asked.
\par 'Yep. 'Night deposit' it's called. People don't have to come around when -'
\par 'I know what it's called! But ... right out in the open like that ... without a guard?'
\par 'Bank don't open till ten thirty most days,' Painter said. 'Even later when the sheriff's had 'em in at night.'
\par 'There's a guard,' Smeg said. 'That's it, isn't it?'
\par 'Guard? What we need a guard fer? Sheriff says leave them things alone, they gets left alone.'
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 The sheriff again, }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 Smeg thought. 'Who ... ahh, deposits money like this?' he asked.
\par 'Like I said: the people who got to get up early and ... '
\par 'But }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 who }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 are these people?'
\par 'Oh. Well, my cousin Reb: He has the gas station down to the forks. Mr Seelway at the General Store there. Some farmers with cash crops come back late from the city. Folks work across the line at the mill in Anderson when they get paid late of a 
Friday. Folks like that.'
\par 'They just ... leave their money out on this porch.'
\par 'Why not?'
\par 'Lord knows,' Smeg whispered.
\par 'Sheriff says don't touch it, why - it don't get touched.'
\par Smeg looked around him, sensing the strangeness of this weed-grown street with its wide-open night depository protected only by a sheriff's command. Who was this sheriff? }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 What }{
\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 was this sheriff?
\par 'Doesn't seem like there'd be much money in Wadeville,' Smeg said. 'That gas station down the main street out there looks abandoned, looks like a good wind would blow it over. Most of the other buildings -'
\par 'Station's closed,' Painter said. 'You need gas, just go out to the forks where my cousin, Reb - '
\par 'Station failed?' Smeg asked.
\par 'Kind of.'
\par 'Kind of?'
\par 'Sheriff, he closed it.'
\par 'Why?'
\par 'Fire
 hazard. Sheriff, he got to reading the state Fire Ordinance one day. Next day he told Jamison to dig up the gas tanks and cart 'em away. They was too old and rusty, not deep enough in the ground and didn't have no concrete on 'em. 'Sides that, the buildi
ng's too old, wood all oily.'
\par 'The sheriff ordered it ... just like that.' Smeg snapped his fingers.
\par 'Yep. Said he had to tear down that station. Old Jamison sure was mad.'
\par 'But if the sheriff says do it, then it gets done?' Smeg asked.
\par 'Yep. Jamison's tearing it down - one board every day. Sheriff don't seem to pay it no mind long as Jamison takes down that one board every day.'
\par Smeg shook his head. One board every day. What did that signify? Lack of a strong time sense? He looked back at the night deposits on the porch, asked: 'How long have people been depositing their money here this way?'
\par 'Been since a week or so after the sheriff come.'
\par 'And how long has that been?'
\par 'Ohhhhh ... four, five years maybe.'
\par Smeg nodded to himself. His little group of Slorin had been on the planet slightly more than five years. This could be ... this could be - He frowned. But what if it wasn't?
\par The dull plodding of footsteps sounded from the main street behind Smeg. He turned, saw a tall fat man passing there. The man glanced curiously at Smeg, nodded to Painter.
\par 'Mornin', Josh,' the fat man said. It was a rumbling voice.
\par 'Morning', Jim,' Painter said.
\par The fat man skirted the Plymouth, hesitated to read the emblem on the car door, glanced back at Painter, resumed his plodding course down the street and out of sight.
\par 'That was Jim,' Painter said.
\par 'Neighbor?'
\par 'Yep. Been over to the Widow McNabry's again ... all the whole dang' night. Sheriff's going to be mighty displeasured believe me.'
\par 'He keeps an eye on your morals, too?'
\par 'Morals?' Painter scratched the back of his neck. 'Can't rightly say he does.'
\par 'Then why would he mind if ... Jim -'
\par 'Sheriff, he says it's a sin and a crime to take what don't belong to you, but it's a blessing to give. Jim, he stood right up to the sheriff, said he jes' went to the widow's to give. So -' Painter shrugged.
\par 'The sheriff's open to persuasion, then?'
\par 'Some folks seems to think so.'
\par 'You don't?'
\par 'He made Jim stop smoking and drinking.'
\par Smeg shook his head sharply, wondering if he'd heard correctly. The conversation kept darting around into seeming irrelevancies. }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 He }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 
adjusted his hat brim, looked at his hand. It was a good hand, couldn't be told from the human original. 'Smoking and drinking?' he asked.
\par 'Yep.'
\par 'But why?'
\par 'Said if Jim was taking on new ree-sponsibilities like the widow he couldn't commit suicide - not even slow like.'
\par Smeg stared at Painter who appeared engrossed with a nonexistent point in the sky. Presently. Smeg managed: 'That's the weirdest interpretation of the law I ever heard.'
\par 'Don't let the sheriff hear you say that.'
\par 'Quick to anger, eh?'
\par 'Wouldn't say that.'
\par 'What }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 would you }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 say?'
\par 'Like I told Jim: Sheriff get his eye on you, that is it. You going to toe the line. Ain't so bad till the sheriff get his eye on you. When he see you - that is the end.'
\par 'Does the sheriff have his eye on you, Mr Painter?'
\par Painter made a fist, shook it at the air. His mouth drew back in a fierce, scowling grimace. The expression faded. Presently, he relaxed, sighed. 'Pretty bad, eh?' Smeg asked.
\par 'Dang conspiracy,' Painter muttered. 'Gov'ment got its nose in things don't concern it.'
\par 'Oh?' Smeg watched Painter closely, sensing they were on productive ground. 'What does - '
\par 'Dang near a thousand gallons a year!' Painter exploded.
\par 'Uhhh -' Smeg said. He wet his lips with his tongue, a gesture he'd found to denote human uncertainty.
\par 'Don't care if you are part of the conspiracy,' Painter said. 'Can't do nothing to me now.'
\par 'Believe me, Mr Painter, I have no designs on ... '
\par 'I made some 'shine when folks wanted,' Painter said. 'Less'n a thousand gallons a year ... almost. Ain't much consid
ering the size of some of them stills t'other side of Anderson. But them's across the line! 'Nother county! All I made was enough fer the folks 'round here.'
\par 'Sheriff put a stop to it?'
\par 'Made me bust up my still.'
\par 'Made }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 you }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 bust up your still?'
\par 'Yep. That's when he got my Barton.'
\par 'Your ... ahhh ... barton?' Smeg ventured.
\par 'Right from under Lilly's nose,' Painter muttered. His nostrils dilated, eyes glared. Rage lay close to the surface.
\par Smeg looked around him, searching the blank windows, the empty doorways. What in the name of all the Slorin furies was a barton?
\par 'Your sheriff seems to hold pretty close to the law,' Smeg ventured.
\par 'Hah!'
\par 'No liquor,' Smeg said. 'No smoking. He rough on speeders?'
\par 'Speeders?' Painter turned his glare on Smeg. 'Now, you tell me what we'd speed in, Mr Smeg.'
\par 'Don't you have any cars here?'
\par 'If my cousin Reb didn't have his station over to the forks where he get the city traffic, he'd be bust long ago. State got a law - car got to stop in jes' so many feet. Got to have jes' so m
any lights. Got to have windshield wiper things. Got to have tires which you can measure the tread on. Got to steer absolutely jes' right. Car don't do them things, it }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 is junk. }{
\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 Junk! Sheriff, he make you sell that car for junk! Ain't but two, three folks in Wadeville can afford a car with all them things.'
\par 'He sounds pretty strict,' Smeg said.
\par 'Bible-totin' parson with hell fire in his eye couldn't be worse. I tell you, if that sheriff didn't have my Barton, I'd a run out long ago. I'd a ree-beled like we done in Sixty-one. Same with the rest of the folks here ... most of 'em.'
\par 'He has their ... ahhh, bartons?' Smeg asked, cocking his head to one side, waiting.
\par Painter considered this for a moment, then: 'Well, now ... in a manner of speaking, you could call it that way.'
\par Smeg frowned. Did he dare ask what a barton was? No! It might betray too much ignorance. He longed for a proper Slorin net, all the interlocked detail memories, the Slorin spaced out within the limits of the narrow band, ready to relay quest
ions, test hypotheses, offer suggestions. But he was alone except for one inexperienced offspring hiding out there across the fields ... waiting for disaster. Perhaps Rick had encountered the word, though. Smeg ventured a weak interrogative.
\par Back came Rick's response, much too loud: 'Negative.'
\par So Rick didn't know the word either.
\par Smeg studied Painter for a sign the man had detected the narrow band exchange. Nothing. Smeg swallowed, a natural fear response he'd noticed in this body, decided to move ahead more strongly.
\par 'Anybody ever tell you you have a most unusual sheriff?' he asked.
\par 'Them gov'ment survey fellows, that's what they say. Come here with all them papers and all them questions, say they interested in our crime rate. Got no crime in Wade County, they say. Think they telling us something!'
\par 'That's what I heard about you,' Smeg offered. 'No crime.'
\par 'Hah!'
\par 'But there must be some crime,' Smeg said.
\par 'Got no 'shine,' Painter muttered. 'Got no robbing and stealing, no gambling. Got no drunk drivers 'cepting they come from somewhere else and then they is mighty displeasured they 
drunk drove in WadeCounty. Got noy'w-venile dee-linquents like they talkabout in the city. Got no patent medicine fellows. Got nothing.'
\par 'You must have a mighty full jail, though.'
\par 'Jail?'
\par 'All the criminals your sheriff apprehends.'
\par 'Hah! Sheriff don't throw folks in jail, Mr Smeg. Not 'less they is from over the line and needs to sleep off a little ol' spree while they sobers up enough to pay the fine.'
\par 'Oh!' Smeg stared out at the empty main street, remembering the fat man - Jim. 'He gives the local residents a bit more latitude, eh? Like your friend, Jim.'
\par 'Jes' leading Jim along, I say.'
\par 'What do you mean?'
\par 'Pretty soon the widow's going to be in the family way. Going to be a quick wedding and a baby and Jim'll be jes' like all the rest of us.'
\par Smeg nod
ded as though he understood. It was like the reports which had lured him here ... but unlike them, too. Painter's 'survey fellows' had been amused by Wadeville and Wade County, so amused even their driest governmentese couldn't conceal it. Their amusement
 had written the area off - 'purely a local phenomenon.' Tough southern sheriff. Smeg was not amused. He walked slowly out to the main street, looked back along the road he'd traveled.
\par Rick was out there listening ... waiting.
\par What would the waiting produce?
\par An abandoned building up the street caught Smeg's attention. Somewhere within it a door creaked with a rhythm that matched the breeze stirring the dust in the street. A 'SALOON' sign dangled from the building on a broken guy wire. The sign swayed in the 
wind - now partly obscured by a porch roof, now revealed: 'LOON' ... 'SALOON' ... 'LOON' ... 'SALOON' ...
\par The mystery of Wadeville was like that sign, Smeg thought. The mystery moved and changed, now one thing, now another. He wondered how he could hold the mystery still long enough to examine it and understand it.
\par A distant wailing interrupted his reverie.
\par It grew louder - a siren.
\par 'Here he come,' Painter said.
\par Smeg glanced at Painter. The man was standing beside him glaring in the direction of the siren.
\par 'Here he sure do come,' Painter muttered.
\par Another sound accompanied the siren now - the hungry throbbing of a powerful motor.
\par Smeg looked toward the sound, saw a dust cloud on the horizon, something vaguely red within it.
\par 'Dad! Dad!' That was Rick on the narrow band.
\par Before he could send out the questioning thought, Smeg felt it - the growing force of a mindcloud so strong it made him stagger.
\par Painter caught his arm, steadied him.
\par 'Gets some folks that way the first time,' Painter said.
\par Smeg composed himself, disengaged his arm, stood trembling. Another Slorin! It had to be another Slorin. But the fool was broadcasting a signal that could bring down chaos on them all. Smeg looked at Painter. The natives had the potential - h
is own Slorin group had determined this. Were they in luck here? Was the local strain insensitive? But Painter had spoken of it getting some folks the first time. He'd spoken of telepaths.
\par Something was very wrong in Wadeville ... and the mindcloud was env
eloping him like a gray fog. Smeg summoned all his mental energy, fought free of the controlling force. He felt himself standing there then like an island of clarity and calm in the midst of that mental hurricane.
\par There were sharp sounds all around him now
 - window blinds snapping up, doors slamming. People began to emerge. They lined the street, a dull-eyed look of expectancy about them, an angry wariness. They appeared to be respectable humans all, Smeg thought, but there was a sameness about them he cou
ldn't quite define. It had something to do with a dowdy, slump-shoulder look.
\par 'You going to see the sheriff,' Painter said. 'That's for sure.'
\par Smeg faced the oncoming thunder of motor and siren. A long red fire truck with a blond young woman in green leotards astride its hood emerged from the dust cloud, hurtled down the street toward the narrow passage where Smeg had parked his car.
\par At the wheel of the truck sat what appeared to be a dark-skinned man in a white suit, dark blue shirt, a white ten-gallon hat. A gold star glittered at his breast. He clutched the steering wheel like a racing driver, head low, eyes forward.
\par Smeg, free of the mindcloud, saw the driver for what he was - a Slorin, still in polymorph, his shape approximating the human ... but not well enough ... not well enough at all.
\par Clustered around the driver, on the truck's seat, clinging to the sides and the ladders on top, were some thirty children. As they entered the village, they began yelling and laughing, screaming greetings.
\par 'There's the sheriff,' Painter said. 'That unusual enough fer you?'
\par The truck swerved to avoid Smeg's car, skidded to a stop opposite the Lane where he stood with Painter. The sheriff stood up, looked back toward the parked car, shouted: 'Who parked that automobile the
re? You see how I had to swing way out to git past it? Somebody tear down my 'No Parking' sign again? Look out if you did! You know I'll find out who you are! Who did that?'
\par While the sheriff was shouting, the children were tumbling off the truck in a caco
phony of greetings - 'Hi, Mama!' 'Daddy, you see me?' 'We been all the way to Comanche Lake swimming.' 'You see the way we come, Pa?' 'You make a pie for me, Mama? Sheriff says I kin have a pie.'
\par 
\par Smeg shook his head at the confusion. All were off the truck now except the sheriff and the blonde on the hood. The mindcloud pervaded the mental atmosphere like a strong odor, but it stopped none of the outcry.
\par Abruptly, there came the loud, spitting crack of a rifle shot. A plume of dust burst from the sheriff's white suit just below the golden star.
\par Silence settled over the street.
\par Slowly, the sheriff turned, the only moving figure in the frozen tableaux. He looked straight up the street toward an open window in the second story of a house beyond the abandoned s
ervice station. His hand came up; a finger extruded. He shook the finger, a man admonishing a naughty child.
\par 'I warned you,' he said.
\par Smeg uttered a Slorin curse under his breath. The fool! No wonder he was staying in polymorph and relying on the mindcloud
 - the whole village was in arms against him. Smeg searched through his accumulated Slorin experience for a clue on how to resolve this situation. A whole village aware of Slorin powers! Oh, that sinful fool!
\par The sheriff looked down at the crowd of silent children, staring first at one and then another. Presently, he pointed to a barefoot girl of about eleven, her yellow hair tied in pigtails, a soiled blue and white dress on her gangling frame.
\par 'You there, Molly Mae,' the sheriff said. 'You see what your daddy done?'
\par The girl lowered her head and began to cry.
\par The blonde on the truck's hood leaped down with a lithe grace, tugged at the sheriff's sleeve.
\par 'Don't interrupt the law in the carrying out of its duties,' the sheriff said.
\par The blonde put her hands on her hips, stamped a foot. 'Tad, you hurt that child and I won't never speak to you, never again,' she said.
\par Painter began muttering half under his breath: 'No ... no ... no ... no -'
\par 'Hurt Molly Mae?' the sheriff asked. 'Now, you know I won't hurt her. But she's got to go away, never see her kin again as long as she lives. You know that.'
\par 'But Molly Mae didn't do you no hurt,' the young woman said. 'It were her daddy. Why can't you send him away?'
\par 'There's some things you just ca
n't understand,' the sheriff said. 'Grown up adult can only be taken from sinful, criminal ways a slow bit at a time 'less'n you make a little child of him. Now, I'd be doing the crime if I made a little child out of a grown-up adult. Little girl like Mol
ly Mae, she's a child right now. Don't make much difference.'
\par So that was it, Smeg thought. That was the sheriff's real hold on this community. Smeg suddenly felt that a barton had to mean - a hostage.
\par 'It's cruel,' the blond young woman said.
\par 'Law got to be cruel sometimes,' the sheriff said. 'Law got to eliminate crime. Almost got it done. Only crimes we had hereabouts for months are crimes 'gainst me. Now, you all know you can't get away with crimes like that. But when you show that }{
\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 dis-}{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 regard for the majesty of the law, you got to be punished. You got to remember, all of you, that every part of a family is ree-sponsible for the whole entire family.'

\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 Pure Slorin thinking, }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 Smeg thought. He wondered if he could make his move without exposing his own alien or
igins. Something had to be done here and soon. Did he dare venture a probe of greeting into the fool's mind? No. The sheriff probably wouldn't even receive the greeting through that mindcloud noise.
\par 'Maybe you're doing something wrong then,' the young woman said. 'Seems awful funny to me when the only crimes are put right on the law itself.'
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 A very pertinent observation, }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 Smeg thought.
\par 
\par Abruptly, Painter heaved himself into motion, lurched through the crowd of children toward the sheriff.
\par 
\par The blond young woman turned, said: 'Daddy! You stay out'n this.'
\par 'You be still now, you hear, Barton Marie?' Painter growled. 'You know you can't do anything,' she wailed. 'He'll only send me away.'
\par 'Good! I say good!' Painter barked. He pushed in front of the young woman, stood glaring up at the sheriff.
\par 'Now, Josh,' the sheriff said, his voice mild. They fell silent, measuring each other.
\par In this moment, Smeg's attention was caught by a figure walking toward them on the road into the village. The figure emerged from the dust - a young man carrying a large black case.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 Rick!}{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 
\par Smeg stared at his offspring. The young man walked like a puppet, loose at the knees. His eyes stared ahead with a blank seeking.
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 The mindcloud, }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 Smeg thought. }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 Rick was young, weak. He'd been calling out,
 wide open when the mindcloud struck. The force that had staggered a secondary ancestor had stunned the young Slorin. He was coming now blindly toward the irritation source.}{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 
\par 'Who that coming there?' the sheriff called. 'That the one parked this car illegal?'
\par 'Rick!' Smeg shouted.
\par Rick stopped.
\par 'Stay where you are!' Smeg called. This time, he sent an awakening probe into the youth.
\par Rick stared around him, awareness creeping into his eyes. He focused on Smeg, mouth falling open.
\par 'Dad!'
\par 'Who're you?' the sheriff demanded, staring at Smeg. A jolt from the mindcloud jarred Smeg.
\par There was only one way to do this, Smeg realized. Fight fire with fire. The natives already had felt the mindcloud.
\par Smeg began opening the enclosing mental shields, dropped them abruptly and lashed out at the sheriff. The Slorin polymorph staggered back, slumped onto the truck seat. His human shape twisted, writhed.
\par 'Who're you?' the sheriff gasped.
\par Shifting to the Slorin gutturals, Smeg said: 'I will ask the questions here. Identify yourself.'
\par Smeg moved forward, a path through the children opening for him. Gently, he moved Painter and the young woman aside.
\par 'Do you understand me?' Smeg demanded.
\par 'I ... understand you.' The Slorin gutturals were, rough and halting, but recognizable.
\par In a softer tone, Smeg said: 'The universe has many crossroads where friends can meet. Identify yourself.'
\par 'Min ... I think. Pzilimin.' The sheriff straightened himself on the seat, restored some of his human shape to its previous form. 'Who are you?'
\par 'I am Sumctroxelunsmeg, secondary ancestor.'
\par 'What's a secondary ancestor?'
\par Smeg sighed. It was pretty much as he had feared. The name, Pzilimin, that was the primary clue - a tertiary ancestor from the }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 Scattership. }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 
But this poor Slorin had been damaged, somehow, lost part of his detail memory. In the process, he had created a situation here that might be impossible to rectify. The extent of the local mess had to be examined now, though.
\par 'I will answer your questions later,' Smeg said. 'Meanwhile -'
\par 'You know this critter?' Painter asked. 'You part of the conspiracy?'
\par Shifting to English, Smeg said: 'Mr Painter, let the government handle its own problems. This man is one of our problems.'
\par 'Well, he sure is a problem and that's the truth.'
\par 'Will you let me handle him?'
\par 'You sure you can do it?'
\par 'I ... think so.'
\par 'I sure hope so.'
\par 
\par Smeg nodded, turned back to the sheriff. 'Have you any idea what you've done here?' he asked in basic Slorin.
\par 'I ... found myself a suitable official position and filled it to the best of my ability. Never betray your niche. I remember that. Never betray your niche.'
\par 'Do you know what you are?'
\par 'I'm ... a Slorin?'
\par 'Correct. A Slorin tertiary ancestor. Have you any idea how you were injured?'
\par 'I ... no. Injured?' He looked around at the people drawing closer, all staring curiously. 'I ... woke up out there in the ... field. Couldn't ... remember -'
\par 'Very well, we'll - '
\par 'I remembered one thing! We were supposed to lower the crime rate, prepare a suitable society in which ... in which ... I ... don't know.'
\par Smeg stared across the children's heads at Rick who had come to a stop behind the truck, returned his attention to Pzilimin.
\par 'I have the crime rate here almost down to an irreducible minimum,' the Slorin sheriff said.
\par Smeg passed a hand across his eyes. Irreducible minimum! He dropped his hand, glared up at the poor fool. 'You have made these people aware of Slorin,' he accused. 'You've made them aware of themselves, which is worse. You've star
ted them thinking about what's behind the law. Something every native law enforcement official on this planet knows by instinct, and you, a Slorin -injured or not - couldn't see it.'
\par 'See what?' Pzilimin asked.
\par 'Without crime there's no need for law enforc
ement officers! We are here to prepare niches in which Slorin can thrive. And you begin by doing yourself out of a job! The first rule in any position is to maintain enough of the required activity for that job to insure your continued employment. Not onl
y that, you must increase your scope, open more such positions. This is what is meant by not betraying your niche.'
\par 'But ... we're supposed to create a society in which \'85 in which -'
\par 'You were supposed to reduce the incidence of violence, you fool! You must channel the crime into more easily manageable patterns. You left them violence! One of them shot at you.'
\par 'Oh ... they've tried worse than that.' Smeg looked to his right, met Painter's questioning gaze.
\par 'He another Hungarian?' Painter asked.
\par 'Ah-h-h, yes!' Smeg said, leaping at this opportunity. 'Thought so, you two talking that foreign language there.' Painter glared up at Pzilimin. 'He oughta be dee-ported.'
\par 'That's the very thing,' Smeg agreed. 'That's why I'm here.'
\par 'Well, by gollies!' Painter said. He sobered. 'I better warn you, though. Sheriff, he got some kind of machine sort of that scrambles your mind. Can't hardly think when he turns it on. Carries it in his pocket, I suspect.'
\par 'We know all about that,' Smeg said. 'I have a machine of the same kind myself. It's a defense secret and he had no right to use it.'
\par 'I'll bet you ain't Department of Agriculture at all,' Painter said. 'I bet you're with the CIA.'
\par 'We won't talk about that,' Smeg said. 'I trust, however, that you and your friends won't mention what has happened here.'
\par 'We're true blue Americans, all of us, Mr Smeg. You don't have to worry about us.'
\par 'Excellent,' Smeg said. And he thought: }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 How convenient. Do they think me an utter fool? }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 Smoothly, he turned back to Pzilimin, asked: 'Did you follow all that?'
\par 'They think you're a secret agent.'
\par 'So it seems. Our task of extracting you from this situation has been facilitated. Now tell me, what have you done about their children?'
\par 'Their children?'
\par 'You heard me.'
\par 'Well ... I just erased all th
ose little tracks in their little minds and put 'em on a train headed north, the ones I sent away to punish their folks. These creatures have a very strong protective instinct toward the young. Don't have to worry about their -'
\par 'I know about their instincts, Pzilimin. We'll have to find those children, restore them and return them.'
\par 'How'll we find them?'
\par 'Very simple. We'll travel back and forth across this continent, listening on the narrow band. We will listen for you, Pzilimin. You cannot erase a mind without putting your own patterns in it.'
\par 'Is that what happened when I tried to change the adult?'
\par Sme
g goggled at him, senses reeling. Pzilimin couldn't have done that, Smeg told himself. He couldn't have converted a native into a Slorin-patterned, full-power broadcast unit and turned it loose on this planet. No Slorin could be that stupid! 'Who?' he man
aged.
\par 'Mr McNabry.'
\par }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 McNabry? McNabry? }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 Smeg knew he'd heard the name somewhere. }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 McNabry? Widow McNabry!}{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 

\par 
\par 'Sheriff, he say something about Widow McNabry?' Painter asked. 'I thought I heard him -'
\par 'What happened to the late Mr McNabry?' Smeg demanded, whirling on Painter.
\par 'Oh, he drowned down south of here. In the river. Never did find his body.'
\par Smeg rounded on Pzilimin. 'Did you - '
\par 'Oh no! He just ran off. We had this report he drowned and I just -'
\par 'In effect, you killed a native.'
\par 'I didn't do it on purpose.'
\par 'Pzilimin, get down off that vehicle and into the rear seat of my machine over here. We wiil forget that I'm illegally parked, shall we?'
\par 'What're you going to do?'
\par 'I'm going to take you away from here. Now, get down off of there!'
\par 'Yes sir.' Pzilimin moved to obey. There was a suggestion of rubbery, nonhuman action to his knees that made Smeg shudder.
\par 'Rick,' Smeg called. 'You will drive.'
\par 'Yes, Dad.'
\par Smeg turned to Painter. 'I hope you all realize the serious consequences to yourselves if any of this should get out?'
\par 'We sure do, Mr Smeg. Depend on it.'
\par 'I am depending on it,' Smeg said. And he thought: }{\i\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 Let them analyze that little statement ... after we're gone. }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 
More and more he was thanking the Slorin god who'd prompted him to change places with Rick. One wrong move and this could've been a disaster. With a curt nod to Painter, he strode to his car, climbed into the rear beside Pzilimin. 'Let's go, Rick.'
\par Presently, they were turned around, headed back toward the state capital. Rick instinctively was pressing the Plymouth to the limit of its speed on this dirt road. Without turning, he spoke over his shoulder to Smeg:
\par 'That was real cool, Dad, the way you handled that. We go right back to the garage now?'
\par 'We disappear at the first opportunity,' Smeg said.
\par 'Disappear?' Pzilimin asked.
\par 'We're going pupa, all of us, and come out into new niches.'
\par 'Why?' Rick said.
\par 'Don't argue with me! That village back there wasn't what it seemed.'
\par Pzilimin stared at him. 'But you said we'd have to find their children and -'
\par 'That was for their benefit, playing the game of ignorance. I suspect they've already found their children. Faster, Rick.'
\par 'I'm going as fast as I dare right now, Dad.'
\par 'No matter. They're not going to chase us.' Smeg took off his western hat, scratched where the band had pressed into his temples.
\par 'What was that village. Dad?' Rick asked.
\par 'I'm not sure,' Smeg said. 'But they made it too easy for us to get Pzilimin out of there. I suspect they are the source of the disaster which set us down here without our ship.'
\par 'Then why didn't they just ... eliminate Pzilimin and -'
\par 'Why didn't Pzilimin simply eliminate those who opposed him?' Smeg asked. 'Violence begets violence, Rick. This is a lesson many sentient beings have learned. They had their own good reasons for handling it this way.'
\par 'What'll we do?' Rick asked.
\par 'We'll go to earth, like foxes, Rick. We will employ the utmost caution and investigate this situation. That is what we'll do.'
\par 'Don't they know that ... back there?'
\par 'Indeed, they must. This should be very interesting.'
\par 
\par Painter stood in the street staring after the retreating car until it was lost in a dust cloud. He nodded to himself once.
\par A tall fat man came up beside him, said: 'Well, Josh, it worked.'
\par 'Told you it would,' Painter said. 'I knew dang well another capsule of them Slorin got away from us when we took their ship.'
\par The blond young woman moved around in front of them, said: 'My dad sure is smart.'
\par 'You listen to me now, Barton Marie,' Painter said. 'Next time you find a blob of something jes' lyin' in a field, you leave it alone, hear?'
\par 'How was I to know it'd be so strong?' she asked.
\par 'That's jes' it!' Painter snapped. 'You never know. That's why you leaves such things alone. It was you made him so dang strong, pokin' him that way. Slorin aren't all that strong 'less'n you ignite'em, hear?'
\par 'Yes, Dad.'
\par 'Dang near five years of him,' the fat man said. 'I don't think I coulda stood another year. He was gettin' worse all the time.'
\par 'They always do,' Painter said.
\par 'What about that Smeg?' the fat man asked.
\par 'That was a wise ol' Slorin,' Painter agreed. 'Seven syllables if I heard his full name rightly.'
\par 'Think he suspects?'
\par 'Pretty sure he does.'
\par 'What we gonna do?'
\par 'What we allus do. We got their ship. We're gonna move out for a spell.'
\par 'Oh-h-h, not again!' the fat man complained.
\par Painter slapped the man's paunch. 'What you howling about, Jim? You changed from McNabry into this when you had to. That's the way life is. You change when you have to.'
\par 'I was just beginning to get used to this place.'
\par Barton Marie stamped her foot. 'But this is such a nice body!'
\par 'There's other bodies, child,' Painter said. 'Jes' as nice.'
\par 'How long you think we got?' }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid15874516 Jim asked.
\par }{\fs20\insrsid13398815\charrsid13398815 'Oh, we got us several months. One thing you can depend on with Slorin, they are cautious. They don't do much of anything very fast.'
\par 'I don't want to leave,' Barton Marie said.
\par 'It won't be forever, child,' Painter said. 'Once they give up hunting for us, we'll com
e back. Slorin make a planet pretty nice for our kind. That's why we tolerates 'em. Course, they're pretty stupid. They work too hard. Even make their own ships ... for which we can be thankful. They haven't learned how to blend into anything but a bureau
cratic society. But that's their misfortune and none of our own.'
\par 
\par 'What did you do about the government survey people?' Smeg asked Pzilimin, bracing himself as the car lurched in a particularly deep rut.
\par 'I interviewed them in my office, kept it pretty shadowy, wore dark glasses,' Pzlimin said. 'Didn't use the ... mindcloud.'
