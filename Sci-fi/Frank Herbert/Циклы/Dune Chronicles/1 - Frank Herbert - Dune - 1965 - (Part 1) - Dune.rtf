\par }{\fs28\insrsid1513027\charrsid13785764 A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Muad'Dib, then, take care that you f
irst place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first
 fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.
\par -from \'93Manual of Muad'Dib\'94 by the Princess Irulan
\par 
\par In the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy, Paul.
\par It was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that had served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore that cooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather.
\par The old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by Paul's room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in his bed.
\par By the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor, the awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door, standing one step ahead of his mother. The old woman was a witch shadow \endash  hair like matted spiderwebs, hooded 
\lquote round darkness of features, eyes like glittering jewels.
\par \'93Is he not small for his age, Jessica?\'94 the old woman asked. Her voice wheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset.
\par Paul's mother answered in her soft contralto: \'93The Atreides are known to start late getting their growth, Your Reverence.\'94 
\par \'93So I've heard, so I've heard,\'94 wheezed the old woman. \'93Yet he's already fifteen.\'94 
\par \'93Yes, Your Reverence.\'94
\par \'93He's awake and listening to us,\'94 said the old woman. \'93Sly little rascal.\'94 She chuckled. \'93But royalty has need of slyness. And if he's really the Kwisatz Haderach\'85 well\'85\'94 
\par Within the shadows of his bed, Paul held his eyes open to mere slits. Two bird-bright ovals \endash  the eyes of the old woman \endash  seemed to expand and glow as they stared into his.
\par \'93Sleep well, you sly little rascal,\'94 said the old woman. \'93Tomorrow you'll need all your faculties to meet my gom jabbar.\'94 
\par And she was gone, pushing his mother out, closing the door with a solid thump.
\par Paul lay awake wondering: What's a gom jabbar?
\par In all the upset during this time of change, the old woman was the strangest thing he had seen. 
\par Your Reverence.
\par And the way she called his mother Jessica like a common serving wench instead of what she was \endash  a Bene Gesserit Lady, a duke's concubine and mother of the ducal heir.
\par Is a gom jabbar something of Arrakis I must know before we go there? he wondered.
\par He mouthed her strange words: Gom jabbar\'85 Kwisatz Haderach.
\par There had been so many things to learn. Arrakis would be a place so different from Caladan that Paul's mind whirled with the new knowledge. Arrakis \endash  Dune \endash  Desert Planet.
\par Thufir Hawat, his father's Master of Assassins
, had explained it: their mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, had been on Arrakis eighty years, holding the planet in quasi-fief under a CHOAM Company contract to mine the geriatric spice, melange. Now the Harkonnens were leaving to be replaced by the House o
f Atreides in fief-complete \endash  an apparent victory for the Duke Leto. Yet, Hawat had said, this appearance contained the deadliest peril, for the Duke Leto was popular among the Great Houses of the Landsraad.
\par \'93A popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful,\'94 Hawat had said.
\par Arrakis \endash  Dune \endash  Desert Planet.
\par Paul fell asleep to dream of an Arrakeen cavern, silent people all around him moving in the dim light of glowglobes. It was solemn there and like a cathedral as he listened to a faint sound \endash  the drip-dr
ip-drip of water. Even while he remained in the dream, Paul knew he would remember it upon awakening. He always remembered the dreams that were predictions. 
\par The dream faded.
\par Paul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his bed \endash  thinking\'85 thinking. This wo
rld of Castle Caladan, without play or companions his own age, perhaps did not deserve sadness in farewell. Dr. Yueh, his teacher, had hinted that the faufreluches class system was not rigidly guarded on Arrakis. The planet sheltered people who lived at t
he desert edge without caid or bashar to command them: will-o'-the-sand people called Fremen, marked down on no census of the Imperial Regate. 
\par Arrakis \endash  Dune \endash  Desert Planet.
\par Paul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body lessons his mother had taught him. Three quick breaths triggered the responses: he fell into the floating awareness\'85 focusing the consciousness\'85 aortal dilation\'85
 avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness\'85 to be conscious by choice\'85 blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload regions\'85 one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone\'85
 animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct\'85 the animal destroys and does not produce\'85 animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual\'85
 the human requires a background grid through which to see his universe\'85 focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid\'85 bodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs\'85
 all things/cells/beings are impermanent\'85 strive for flow-permanence within\'85 
\par Over and over and over within Paul's floating awareness the lesson rolled.
\par When dawn touched Paul's window sill with yellow light, he sensed it through closed eyelids, opened them, hearing then the renewed bustle and hurry in the castle, seeing the familiar patterned beams of his bedroom ceiling.
\par The hall door opened and his mother peered in, hair like shaded bronze held with a black ribbon at the crown, her oval face emotionless and green eyes staring solemnly. 
\par \'93You're awake,\'94 she said. \'93Did you sleep well?\'94 
\par \'93Yes.\'94
\par He studied the tallness of her, saw the hint of tension in her shoulders as she chose clothing for him from the closet racks. Another might have missed the tension, but she had trained him in the Bene Gesserit Way \endash 
 in the minutiae of observation. She turned, holding a semiformal jacket for him. It carried the red Atreides hawk crest above the breast pocket.
\par \'93Hurry and dress,\'94 she said. \'93Reverend Mother is waiting.\'94 
\par \'93I dreamed of her once,\'94 Paul said. \'93Who is she?\'94 
\par \'93She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school. Now, she's the Emperor's Truthsayer. And Paul\'85\'94 She hesitated. \'93You must tell her about your dreams.\'94
\par \'93I will. Is she the reason we got Arrakis?\'94
\par \'93We did not get Arrakis.\'94 Jessica flicked dust from a pair of trousers, hung them with the jacket on the dressing stand beside his bed. \'93Don't keep Reverend Mother waiting.\'94 
\par Paul sat up, hugged his knees. \'93What's a gom jabbar?\'94 
\par Again, the training she had given him exposed her almost invisible hesitation, a nervous betrayal he felt as fear.
\par Jessica crossed to the window, flung wide the draperies, stared across the river orchards toward Mount Syubi. \'93You'll learn about\'85 the gom jabbar soon enough,\'94 she said. 
\par He heard the fear in her voice and wondered at it.
\par Jessica spoke without turning. \'93Reverend Mother is waiting in my morning room. Please hurry.\'94
\par 
\par The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam sat in a tapestried chair watching mother and son
 approach. Windows on each side of her overlooked the curving southern bend of the river and the green farmlands of the Atreides family holding, but the Reverend Mother ignored the view. She was feeling her age this morning, more than a little petulant. S
h
e blamed it on space travel and association with that abominable Spacing Guild and its secretive ways. But here was a mission that required personal attention from a Bene Gesserit-with-the-Sight. Even the Padishah Emperor's Truthsayer couldn't evade that 
responsibility when the duty call came.
\par Damn that Jessica! the Reverend Mother thought. If only she \lquote d borne us a girl as she was ordered to do!
\par Jessica stopped three paces from the chair, dropped a small curtsy, a gentle flick of left hand along the line of her skirt. Paul gave the short bow his dancing master had taught \endash  the one used \'93when in doubt of another's station.\'94
\par The nuances of Paul's greeting were not lost on the Reverend Mother. She said: \'93He's a cautious one, Jessica.\'94 
\par Jessica's hand went to Paul's shoulder, tightened there. For a heartbeat, fear pulsed through her palm. Then she had herself under control. \'93Thus he has been taught, Your Reverence.\'94 
\par What does she fear? Paul wondered.
\par The old woman studied Paul in one gestalten flicker: face oval like Jessica's, but strong bones\'85
 hair: the Duke's black-black but with browline of the maternal grandfather who cannot be named, and that thin, disdainful nose; shape of directly staring green eyes: like the old Duke, the paternal grandfather who is dead.
\par Now, there was a man who appreciated the power of bravura \endash  even in death, the Reverend Mother thought.
\par \'93Teaching is one thing,\'94 she said, \'93the basic ingredient is another. We shall see.\'94 The old eyes darted a hard glance at Jessica. \'93Leave us. I enjoin you to practice the meditation of peace.\'94
\par Jessica took her hand from Paul's shoulder. \'93Your Reverence, I \endash \'94 
\par \'93Jessica, you know it must be done.\'94 
\par Paul looked up at his mother, puzzled. 
\par Jessica straightened. \'93Yes\'85 of course.\'94
\par Paul looked back at the Reverend Mother. Politeness and his mother's obvious awe of this old woman argued caution. Yet he felt an angry apprehension at the fear he sensed radiating from his mother.
\par \'93Paul\'85 \'94 Jessica took a deep breath. \'93\'85 this test you're about to receive\'85 it's important to me.\'94 
\par \'93Test?\'94 He looked up at her.
\par \'93Remember that you're a duke's son, \'93Jessica said. She whirled and strode from the room in a dry swishing of skirt. The door closed solidly behind her.
\par Paul faced the old woman, holding anger in check. \'93Does one dismiss the Lady Jessica as though she were a serving wench?\'94 
\par A smile flicked the corners of the wrinkled old mouth. \'93The Lady Jessica was my serving wench, lad, for fourteen years at school.\'94 She nodded. \'93And a good one, too. Now, you come here!\'94
\par The command whipped out at him. Paul found himself obeying before he could think about it. Using the Voice on me, he thought. He stopped at her gesture, standing beside her knees.
\par \'93See this?\'94 she asked. From the folds of her gown, she lifted a green metal cube about fifteen centimeters on a side. She turned it and Paul saw that one side was open \endash  black and oddly frightening. No light penetrated that open blackness. 

\par \'93Put your right hand in the box,\'94 she said.
\par Fear shot through Paul. He started to back away, but the old woman said: \'93Is this how you obey your mother?\'94 
\par He looked up into bird-bright eyes.
\par Slowly, feeling the compulsions and unable to inhibit them, Paul put his hand into the box. He felt first a sense of cold as the blackness closed around his hand, then slick metal against his fingers and a prickling as though his hand were asleep.
\par A predatory look filled the old woman's features. She lifted her right hand away from the box and poised the hand close to the side of Paul's neck. He saw a glint of metal there and started to turn toward
\par \'93Stop!\'94 she snapped.
\par Using the Voice again! He swung his attention back to her face.
\par \'93I hold at your neck the gom jabbar,\'94 she said. \'93The gom jabbar, the high-handed enemy. It's a needle with a drop of poison on its tip. Ah-ah! Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison.\'94 
\par Paul tried to swallow in a dry throat. He could not take his attention from the seamed old face, the glistening eyes, the pale gums around silvery metal teeth that flashed as she spoke.
\par \'93A duke's son must know about poisons,\'94 she said. \'93
It's the way of our times, eh? Musky, to be poisoned in your drink. Aumas, to be poisoned in your food. The quick ones and the slow ones and the ones in between. Here's a new one for you: the gom jabbar. It kills only animals.\'94
\par Pride overcame Paul's fear. \'93You dare suggest a duke's son is an animal?\'94 he demanded.
\par \'93Let us say I suggest you may be human,\'94 she said. \'93Steady! I warn you not to try jerking away. I am old, but my hand can drive this needle into your neck before you escape me.\'94 
\par \'93Who are you?\'94 he whispered. \'93How did you trick my mother into leaving me alone with you? Are you from the Harkonnens?\'94 
\par \'93The Harkonnens? Bless us, no! Now, be silent.\'94 A dry finger touched his neck and he stilled the involuntary urge to leap away.
\par \'93Good,\'94 she said. \'93You pass the first test. Now, here's the way of the rest of it: If you withdraw your hand from the box you die. This is the only rule. Keep your hand in the box and live. Withdraw it and die.\'94
\par Paul took a deep breath to still his trembling. \'93If I call out there'll be servants on you in seconds and you'll die.\'94
\par \'93Servants will not pass your mother who stands guard outside that door. Depend on it. Your mother survived this test. Now it's your turn. Be honored. We seldom administer this to men-children.\'94
\par Curiosity reduced Paul's fear to a manageable level. He heard truth in the old woman's voice, no denying it. If his mother stood guard out there\'85 if this were truly a test\'85 And whatever it was, he knew himself caught in it, trapped by tha
t hand at his neck: the gom jabbar. He recalled the response from the Litany against Fear as his mother had taught him out of the Bene Gesserit rite.
\par \'93I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will
 face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.\'94
\par He felt calmness return, said: \'93Get on with it, old woman.\'94 
\par \'93Old woman!\'94 she snapped. \'93You've courage, and that can't be denied. Well, we shall see, sirra.\'94 She bent close, lowered her voice almost to a whisper. \'93
You will feel pain in this hand within the box. Pain. But! Withdraw the hand and I'll touch your neck with my gom jabbar \endash  the death so swift it's like the fall of the headsman's axe. Withdraw your hand and the gom jabbar takes you. Understand?\'94
 
\par \'93What's in the box?\'94 
\par \'93Pain.\'94
\par He felt increased tingling in his hand, pressed his lips tightly together. How could this be a test? he wondered. The tingling became an itch.
\par The old woman said; \'93You've heard of animals chewing off a leg to escape a trap? There's an animal kind of trick. A human would remain in the trap, endure the pain, feigning death that he might kill the trapper and remove a threat to his kind.\'94

\par The itch became the faintest burning. \'93Why are you doing this?\'94 he demanded.
\par \'93To determine if you're human. Be silent.\'94
\par Paul clenched his left hand into a fist as the burning sensation increased in the other hand. It mounted slowly: heat upon heat upon heat\'85
 upon heat. He felt the fingernails of his free hand biting the palm. He tried to flex the fingers of the burning hand, but couldn't move them.
\par \'93It burns,\'94 he whispered. 
\par \'93Silence!\'94
\par Pain throbbed up his arm. Sweat stood out on his forehead. Every fibre cried out to withdraw the hand from that burning pit\'85 but\'85
 the gom jabbar. Without turning his head, he tried to move his eyes to see that terrible needle poised beside his neck. He sensed that he was breathing in gasps, tried to slow his breaths and couldn't. 
\par Pain!
\par His world emptied of everything except that hand immersed in agony, the ancient face inches away staring at him. 
\par His lips were so dry he had difficulty separating them. 
\par The burning! The burning!
\par He thought he could feel skin curling black on that agonized hand, the flesh crisping and dropping away until only charred bones remained.
\par It stopped!
\par As though a switch had been turned off, the pain stopped.
\par Paul felt his right arm trembling, felt sweat bathing his body.
\par \'93Enough,\'94 the old woman muttered. \'93Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must've wanted you to fail.\'94 She leaned back, withdrawing the gom jabbar from the side of his neck. \'93Take your hand from the box, young human
, and look at it.\'94 
\par He fought down an aching shiver, stared at the lightless void where his hand seemed to remain of its own volition. Memory of pain inhibited every movement. Reason told him he would withdraw a blackened stump from that box. 
\par \'93Do it!\'94 she snapped.
\par He jerked his hand from the box, stared at it astonished. Not a mark. No sign of agony on the flesh. He held up the hand, turned it, flexed the fingers.
\par \'93Pain by nerve induction,\'94 she said. \'93Can't go around maiming potential humans. There're those who'd give a pretty for the secret of this box, though.\'94 She slipped it into the folds of her gown.
\par \'93But the pain \endash \'94 he said.
\par \'93Pain,\'94 she sniffed. \'93A human can override any nerve in the body.\'94
\par Paul felt his left hand aching, uncurled the clenched fingers, looked at four bloody marks where fingernails had bitten his palm. He dropped the hand to his side, looked at the old woman. \'93You did that to my mother once?\'94 
\par \'93Ever sift sand through a screen?\'94 she asked.
\par The tangential slash of her question shocked his mind into a higher awareness: Sand through a screen, he nodded. 
\par \'93We Bene Gesserit sift people to find the humans.\'94 
\par He lifted his right hand, willing the memory of the pain. \'93And that's all there is to it \endash  pain?\'94
\par \'93I observed you in pain, lad. Pain's merely the axis of the test. Your mother's told you about our ways of observing. I see the signs of her teaching in you. Our test is crisis and observation.\'94 
\par He heard the confirmation in her voice, said: \'93It's truth!\'94 
\par She stared at him. He senses truth! Could he be the one? Could he truly be the one? She extinguished the excitement, reminding herself: \'93Hope clouds observation.\'94 
\par \'93You know when people believe what they say,\'94 she said. 
\par \'93I know it.\'94
\par The harmonics of ability confirmed by repeated test were in his voice. She heard them, said: \'93Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach. Sit down, little brother, here at my feet.\'94 
\par \'93I prefer to stand.\'94
\par \'93Your mother sat at my feet once.\'94 
\par \'93I'm not my mother.\'94
\par \'93You hate us a little, eh?\'94 She looked toward the door, called out: \'93Jessica!\'94
\par The door flew open and Jessica stood there staring hard-eyed into the room. Hardness melted from her as she saw Paul. She managed a faint smile.
\par \'93Jessica, have you ever stopped hating me?\'94 the old woman asked.
\par \'93I both love and hate you,\'94 Jessica said. \'93The hate \endash  that's from pains I must never forget. The love \endash  that's\'85 \'94 
\par \'93Just the basic fact,\'94 the old woman said, but her voice was gentle. \'93You may come in now, but remain silent. Close that door and mind it that no one interrupts us.\'94
\par Jessica stepped into the room, closed the door and stood with her back to it. My son lives, she thought. My son lives and is\'85 human. I knew he was\'85 but\'85
 he lives. Now, I can go on living. The door felt hard and real against her back. Everything in the room was immediate and pressing against her senses. 
\par My son lives.
\par Paul looked at his mother. She told the truth. He wanted to get away alone and think this experience through, but knew he could not leave until he was dismissed. The old woman had gained a power ov
er him. They spoke truth. His mother had undergone this test. There must be terrible purpose in it\'85
 the pain and fear had been terrible. He understood terrible purposes. They drove against all odds. They were their own necessity. Paul felt that he had been infected with terrible purpose. He did not know yet what the terrible purpose was.
\par \'93Some day, lad,\'94 the old woman said, \'93you, too, may have to stand outside a door like that. It takes a measure of doing.\'94 
\par Paul looked down at the hand that had known pain,
 then up to the Reverend Mother. The sound of her voice had contained a difference then from any other voice in his experience. The words were outlined in brilliance. There was an edge to them. He felt that any question he might ask her would bring an ans
wer that could lift him out of his flesh-world into something greater. 
\par \'93Why do you test for humans?\'94 he asked. 
\par \'93To set you free.\'94 
\par \'93Free?\'94
\par \'93Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.\'94
\par \'93 \lquote Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man's mind,\rquote  \'93 Paul quoted.
\par \'93Right out of the Butlerian Jihad and the Orange Catholic Bible,\'94 she said. \'93But what the O.C. Bible should've said is: \lquote Thou shalt not make a machine to counterfeit a human mind.\rquote  Have you studied the Mentat in your service?\'94 

\par \'93I've studied with Thufir Hawat.\'94
\par \'93The Great Revolt took away a crutch,\'94 she said. \'93It forced human minds to develop. Schools were started to train human talents. \'93 
\par \'93Bene Gesserit schools?\'94
\par She nodded. \'93We have two chief survivors of those ancient schools: the Bene Gesserit and the Spacing Guild. The Guild, so we think, emphasizes almost pure mathematics. Bene Gesserit performs another function.\'94 
\par \'93Politics,\'94 he said.
\par \'93Kull wahad!\'94 the old woman said. She sent a hard glance at Jessica.
\par \'93I've not told him. Your Reverence,\'94 Jessica said.
\par The Reverend Mother returned her attention to Paul. \'93You did that on remarkably few clues,\'94 she said. \'93Politics indeed. The origi
nal Bene Gesserit school was directed by those who saw the need of a thread of continuity in human affairs. They saw there could be no such continuity without separating human stock from animal stock \endash  for breeding purposes.\'94
\par The old woman's words abruptly
 lost their special sharpness for Paul. He felt an offense against what his mother called his instinct for rightness. It wasn't that Reverend Mother lied to him. She obviously believed what she said. It was something deeper, something tied to his terrible
 purpose.
\par He said: \'93But my mother tells me many Bene Gesserit of the schools don't know their ancestry.\'94
\par \'93The genetic lines are always in our records,\'94 she said. \'93Your mother knows that either she's of Bene Gesserit descent or her stock was acceptable in itself.\'94 
\par \'93Then why couldn't she know who her parents are?\'94 
\par \'93Some do\'85 Many don't. We might, for example, have wanted to breed her to a close relative to set up a dominant in some genetic trait. We have many reasons.\'94
\par Again, Paul felt the offense against rightness. He said: \'93You take a lot on yourselves.\'94
\par The Reverend Mother stared at him, wondering: Did I hear criticism in his voice? \'93We carry a heavy burden,\'94 she said.
\par Paul felt himself coming more and more out of the shock of the test. He leveled a measuring stare at her, said: \'93You say maybe I'm the\'85 Kwisatz Haderach. What's that, a human gom jabbar?\'94 
\par \'93Paul,\'94 Jessica said. \'93You mustn't take that tone with \endash \'94 
\par \'93I'll handle this, Jessica,\'94 the old woman said. \'93Now, lad, do you know about the Truthsayer drug?\'94
\par \'93You take it to improve your ability to detect falsehood,\'94 he said. \'93My mother's told me.\'94 
\par \'93Have you ever seen truthtrance?\'94 
\par He shook his head. \'93No.\'94
\par \'93The drug's dangerous,\'94 she said, \'93but it gives insight. When a Truthsayer's gifted by the drug, she can look many places in her memory \endash  in her body's memory. We look down so many avenues of the past\'85 but only feminine avenues.\'94
 Her voice took on a note of sadness. \'93Yet, there's a place where no Truthsayer can see. We are repelled by it, terrorized. It is said a man will come one day and find in the gift of the drug his inward eye. He will look where we cannot \endash 
 into both feminine and masculine pasts.\'94 
\par \'93Your Kwisatz Haderach?\'94
\par \'93Yes, the one who can be many places at once: the Kwisatz Haderach. Many men have tried the drug\'85 so many, but none has succeeded.\'94 
\par \'93They tried and failed, all of them?\'94 
\par \'93Oh, no.\'94 She shook her head. \'93They tried and died.\'94
\par 
\par 
\par To attempt an understanding of Muad'Dib without understanding his mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, is to attempt seeing Truth without knowing Falsehood. It is the attempt to see the Light without knowing Darkness. It cannot be.
\par -from \'93Manual of Muad'Dib\'94 by the Princess Irulan
\par 
\par It was a relief globe of a world, partly in shadows, spinning under the impetus of a 
fat hand that glittered with rings. The globe sat on a freeform stand at one wall of a windowless room whose other walls presented a patchwork of multicolored scrolls, filmbooks, tapes and reels. Light glowed in the room from golden balls hanging in mobil
e suspensor fields.
\par An ellipsoid desk with a top of jade-pink petrified elacca wood stood at the center of the room. Veriform suspensor chairs ringed it, two of them occupied. In one sat a dark-haired youth of about sixteen years, round of face and with sul
len eyes. The other held a slender, short man with effeminate face.
\par Both youth and man stared at the globe and the man half-hidden in shadows spinning it.
\par A chuckle sounded beside the globe. A basso voice rumbled out of the chuckle: \'93There it is, Piter \endash  the biggest mantrap in all history. And the Duke's headed into its jaws. Is it not a magnificent thing that I, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, do?
\'94 
\par \'93Assuredly, Baron,\'94 said the man. His voice came out tenor with a sweet, musical quality.
\par The fat hand descend
ed onto the globe, stopped the spinning. Now, all eyes in the room could focus on the motionless surface and see that it was the kind of globe made for wealthy collectors or planetary governors of the Empire. It had the stamp of Imperial handicraft about 
it. Latitude and longitude lines were laid in with hair-fine platinum wire. The polar caps were insets of finest cloud-milk diamonds.
\par The fat hand moved, tracing details on the surface. \'93I invite you to observe,\'94 the basso voice rumbled. \'93Observe closely, Piter, and you, too, Feyd-Rautha, my darling: from sixty degrees north to seventy degrees south \endash 
 these exquisite ripples. Their coloring: does it not remind you of sweet caramels? And nowhere do you see blue of lakes or rivers or seas. And these lovely polar caps \endash 
 so small. Could anyone mistake this place? Arrakis! Truly unique. A superb setting for a unique Victory.\'94
\par A smile touched Piter's lips. \'93And to think. Baron: the Padishah Emperor believes he's given the Duke your spice planet. How poignant.\'94
\par \'93That's a nonsensical statement,\'94 the Baron rumbled. \'93You say this to confuse young Feyd-Rautha, but it is not necessary to confuse my nephew.\'94
\par The sullen-faced youth stirred in his chair, smoothed a wrinkle in the black leotards he wore. He sat upright as a discreet tapping sounded at the door in the wall behind him.
\par Piter unfolded from his chair, crossed to the door, cracked it wide enough to accept a message cylinder. He closed the door, unrolled the cylinder and scanned it. A chuckle sounded from him. Another.
\par \'93Well?\'94 the Baron demanded.
\par \'93The fool answered us, Baron!\'94
\par \'93Whenever did an Atreides refuse the opportunity for a gesture?\'94 the Baron asked. \'93Well, what does he say?\'94 
\par \'93He's most uncouth, Baron. Addresses you as \lquote Harkonnen\rquote  \endash  no \lquote Sire et Cher Cousin,\rquote  no title, nothing.\'94
\par \'93It's a good name,\'94 the Baron growled, and his voice betrayed his impatience. \'93What does dear Leto say?\'94
\par \'93He says: \lquote Your offer of a meeting is refused. I have ofttimes met your treachery and this all men know.\rquote  \'93 
\par \'93And?\'94 the Baron asked.
\par \'93He says: \lquote The art of kanly still has admirers in the Empire.\rquote  He signs it: \lquote Duke Leto of Arrakis.\rquote  \'93 Piter began to laugh. \'93Of Arrakis! Oh, my! This is almost too rich!\'94
\par {\*\bkmkstart One}{\*\bkmkend One}\'93Be silent, Piter,\'94 the Baron said, and the laughter stopped as though shut off with a switch. \'93Kanly, is it?\'94 the Baron asked. \'93
Vendetta, heh? And he uses the nice old word so rich in tradition to be sure I know he means it.\'94
\par \'93You made the peace gesture,\'94 Piter said. \'93The forms have been obeyed.\'94
\par \'93For a Mentat, you talk too much, Piter,\'94
 the Baron said. And he thought: I must do away with that one soon. He has almost outlived his usefulness. The Baron stared across the room at his Mental assassin, seeing the feature about him that most people noticed first: the eyes, the shaded slits of 
blue within blue, the eyes without any white in them at all.
\par A grin flashed across Piter's face. It was like a mask grimace beneath those eyes like holes. \'93But, Baron! Never has revenge been more beautiful. It is to see a plan of the most exquisite treachery: to make Leto exchange Caladan for Dune \endash 
 and without alternative because the Emperor orders it. How waggish of you!\'94 
\par In a cold voice, the Baron said: \'93You have a flux of the mouth, Piter.\'94
\par \'93But I am happy, my Baron. Whereas you\'85 you are touched by jealousy.\'94 
\par \'93Piter!\'94
\par \'93Ah-ah. Baron! Is it not regrettable you were unable to devise this delicious scheme by yourself?\'94
\par \'93Someday I will have you strangled, Piter.\'94 
\par \'93Of a certainty, Baron. Enfin! But a kind act is never lost, eh?\'94 
\par \'93Have you been chewing verite or semuta, Piter?\'94 
\par \'93Truth without fear surprises the Baron,\'94 Piter said. His face drew down into a caricature of a frowning mask. \'93Ah, hah! But you see, Baron, I know as a Mentat when you will send the executioner. You will hold back just so long as I 
am useful. To move sooner would be wasteful and I'm yet of much use. I know what it is you learned from that lovely Dune planet \endash  waste not. True, Baron?\'94 
\par The Baron continued to stare at Piter.
\par Feyd-Rautha squirmed in his chair. These wrangling fools! he thought. My uncle cannot talk to his Mental without arguing. Do they think I've nothing to do except listen their arguments?
\par \'93Feyd,\'94 the Baron said. \'93I told you to listen and learn when I invited you in here. Are you learning?\'94 
\par \'93Yes, Uncle.\'94 the voice was carefully subservient.
\par \'93Sometimes I wonder about Piter,\'94 the Baron said. \'93I cause pain out of necessity, but he\'85 I swear he takes a positive delight in it. For myself, I can feel pity toward the poor Duke Leto. Dr. Yueh will move against him soon, and tha
t'll be the end of all the Atreides. But surely Leto will know whose hand directed the pliant doctor\'85 and knowing that will be a terrible thing.\'94 
\par \'93Then why haven't you directed the doctor to slip a kindjal between his ribs quietly and efficiently?\'94 Piter asked. \'93You talk of pity, but \endash \'94
\par \'93The Duke must know when I encompass his doom,\'94 the Baron said. \'93And the other Great Houses must learn of it. The knowledge will give them pause. I'll gain a bit more room to maneuver. The necessity is obvious, but I don't have to like it.\'94

\par \'93Room to maneuver,\'94 Piter sneered. \'93Already you have the Emperor's eyes on you, Baron. You move too boldly. One day the Emperor will send a legion or two of his Sardaukar down here onto Giedi Prime and that'll be an end to the Baron Vladi
mir Harkonnen.\'94
\par \'93You'd like to see that, wouldn't you, Piter?\'94 the Baron asked. \'93You'd enjoy seeing the Corps of Sardaukar pillage through my cities and sack this castle. You'd truly enjoy that.\'94 
\par \'93Does the Baron need to ask?\'94 Piter whispered.
\par \'93You should've been a Bashar of the Corps,\'94 the Baron said. \'93You're too interested in blood and pain. Perhaps I was too quick with my promise of the spoils of Arrakis.\'94
\par Piter took five curiously mincing steps into the room, stopped directly behind Feyd-Rautha. There was a tight air of tension in the room, and the youth looked up at Piter with a worried frown.
\par \'93Do not toy with Piter, Baron,\'94 Piter said. \'93You promised me the Lady Jessica. You promised her to me.\'94 
\par \'93For what, Piter?\'94 the Baron asked. \'93For pain?\'94 
\par Piter stared at him, dragging out the silence.
\par Feyd-Rautha moved his suspensor chair to one side, said: \'93Uncle, do I have to stay? You said you'd \endash \'94
\par \'93My darling Feyd-Rautha grows impatient,\'94 the Baron said. He moved within the shadows beside the globe. \'93Patience, Feyd.\'94 And he turned his attention back to the Mentat. \'93What of the Dukeling, the child Paul, my dear Piter?\'94 
\par \'93The trap will bring him to you, Baron,\'94 Piter muttered.
\par \'93That's not my question,\'94 the Baron said. \'93You'll recall that you predicted the Bene Gesserit witch would bear a daughter to the Duke. You were wrong, eh, Mentat?\'94
\par \'93I'm not often wrong, Baron,\'94 Piter said, and for the first time there was fear in his voice. \'93Give me that: I'm not often wrong. And you know yourself these Bene Gesserit bear mos
tly daughters. Even the Emperor's consort had produced only females.\'94 
\par \'93Uncle,\'94 said Feyd-Rautha, \'93you said there'd be something important here for me to \endash \'94
\par \'93Listen to my nephew,\'94 the Baron said. \'93He aspires to rule my Barony, yet he cannot rule himself.\'94 The Baron stirred beside the globe, a shadow among shadows. \'93
Well then, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, I summoned you here hoping to teach you a bit of wisdom. Have you observed our good Mentat? You should've learned something from this exchange.\'94 
\par \'93But, Uncle \endash \'94 
\par \'93A most efficient Mentat, Piter, wouldn't you say, Feyd?\'94 
\par \'93Yes, but \endash \'94
\par \'93Ah! Indeed but! But he consumes too much spice, eats it like candy. Look at his eyes! He might've come directly from the Arrakeen labor pool. Efficient, Piter, but he's still emotion
al and prone to passionate outbursts. Efficient, Piter, but he still can err.\'94
\par Piter spoke in a low, sullen tone: \'93Did you call me in here to impair my efficiency with criticism, Baron?\'94
\par \'93Impair your efficiency? You know me better, Piter. I wish only for my nephew to understand the limitations of a Mentat.\'94 
\par \'93Are you already training my replacement?\'94 Piter demanded.
\par \'93Replace you? Why, Piter, where could I find another Mentat with your cunning and venom?\'94 
\par \'93The same place you found me, Baron.\'94
\par \'93Perhaps I should at that,\'94 the Baron mused. \'93You do seem a bit unstable lately. And the spice you eat!\'94
\par \'93Are my pleasures too expensive, Baron? Do you object to them?\'94
\par \'93My dear Piter, your pleasures are what tie you to me. How could I object to that? I merely wish my nephew to observe this about you.\'94
\par \'93Then I'm on display,\'94 Piter said. \'93Shall I dance? Shall I perform my various functions for the eminent Feyd-Rau-\'94 
\par \'93Precisely,\'94 the Baron said. \'93You are on display. Now, be silent.\'94 He glanced at Feyd-Rautha, noting his nephew's lips, the full and pouting look of them, the Harkonnen genetic marker, now twisted slightly in amusement. \'93
This is a Mentat, Feyd. It has been trained and conditioned to perform certain duties. The fact that it's encased in a human body, however, m
ust not be overlooked. A serious drawback, that. I sometimes think the ancients with their thinking machines had the right idea.\'94
\par \'93They were toys compared to me,\'94 Piter snarled. \'93You yourself, Baron, could outperform those machines.\'94
\par \'93Perhaps,\'94 the Baron said. \'93Ah, well\'85 \'94 He took a deep breath, belched. \'93Now, Piter, outline for my nephew the salient features of our campaign against the House of Atreides. Function as a Mentat for us, if you please.\'94
\par \'93Baron, I've warned you not to trust one so young with this information. My observations of \endash \'94
\par \'93I'll be the judge of this,\'94 the Baron said. \'93I give you an order, Mentat. Perform one of your various functions.\'94
\par \'93So be it,\'94 Piter said. He straightened, assuming an odd attitude of dignity \endash  as though it were another mask, but this time clothing his entire body. \'93
In a few days Standard, the entire household of the Duke Leto will embark on a Spacing Guild liner for Arrakis. The Guild will deposit them at the city of Arrakeen rather than at our city of Carthag. The Duke
's Mentat, Thufir Hawat, will have concluded rightly that Arrakeen is easier to defend.\'94
\par \'93Listen carefully, Feyd,\'94 the Baron said. \'93Observe the plans within plans within plans.\'94
\par Feyd-Rautha nodded, thinking: This is more like it. The old monster is letting me in on secret things at last. He must really mean for me to be his heir.
\par \'93There are several tangential possibilities,\'94 Piter said. \'93I indicate that House Atreides will go to Arrakis. We must not, however, ignore the possibility the Duke has contracted w
ith the Guild to remove him to a place of safety outside the System. Others in like circumstances have become renegade Houses, taking family atomics and shields and fleeing beyond the Imperium.\'94 
\par \'93The Duke's too proud a man for that,\'94 the Baron said.
\par \'93It is a possibility,\'94 Piter said. \'93The ultimate effect for us would be the same, however.\'94
\par \'93No, it would not!\'94 the Baron growled. \'93I must have him dead and his line ended.\'94
\par \'93That's the high probability,\'94 Piter said. \'93There are certain preparations that indicate when a House is going renegade. The Duke appears to be doing none of these things.\'94 
\par \'93So,\'94 the Baron sighed. \'93Get on with it, Piter.\'94 
\par \'93At Arrakeen,\'94 Piter said, \'93the Duke and his family will occupy the Residency, lately the home of Count and Lady Fenring.\'94 
\par \'93The Ambassador to the Smugglers,\'94 the Baron chuckled. 
\par \'93Ambassador to what?\'94 Feyd-Rautha asked.
\par \'93Your uncle makes a joke,\'94 Piter said. \'93He calls Count Fenring Ambassador to the Smugglers, indicating the Emperor's interest in smuggling operations on Arrakis.\'94 
\par Feyd-Rautha turned a puzzled stare on his uncle. \'93Why?\'94 
\par \'93Don't be dense, Feyd,\'94 the Baron snapped. \'93As long as the Guild remains effectively outside Imperial control, how could it be otherwise? How else could spies and assassins move about?\'94 
\par Feyd-Rautha's mouth made a soundless \'93Oh-h-h-h.\'94 
\par \'93We've arranged diversions at the Residency,\'94 Piter said. \'93There'll be an attempt on the life of the Atreides heir \endash  an attempt which could succeed.\'94 
\par \'93Piter,\'94 the Baron rumbled, \'93you indicated \endash \'94 
\par \'93I indicated accidents can happen,\'94 Piter said. \'93And the attempt must appear valid.\'94
\par \'93Ah, but the lad has such a sweet young body,\'94 the Baron said. \'93Of course, he's potentially more dangerous than the father\'85 with that witch mother training him. Accursed woman! Ah, well, please continue, Piter.\'94
\par \'93Hawat will have divined that we have an agent planted on him,\'94 Piter said. \'93The obvious suspect is Dr. Yueh, who is indeed our agent. But Hawat has investigated and found that our doctor is a Suk School graduate with Imperial Conditioning 
\endash  supposedly safe enough to minister even to the Emperor. Great store is set on Imperial Conditioning. It's assumed that ultimate conditioning cannot be removed without killing the subject. However, as someone once observed, given the right 
lever you can move a planet. We found the lever that moved the doctor.\'94
\par \'93How?\'94 Feyd-Rautha asked. He found this a fascinating subject. Everyone knew you couldn't subvert Imperial Conditioning! 
\par \'93Another time,\'94 the Baron said. \'93Continue, Piter.\'94 
\par \'93In place of Yueh,\'94 Piter said, \'93we'll drag a most interesting suspect across Hawat's path. The very audacity of this suspect will recommend her to Hawat's attention.\'94 
\par \'93Her?\'94 Feyd-Rautha asked.
\par \'93The Lady Jessica herself,\'94 the Baron said.
\par \'93Is it not sublime?\'94 Piter asked. \'93Hawat's mind will be so filled with this prospect it'll impair his function as a Mentat. He may even try to kill her.\'94 Piter frowned, then: \'93But I don't think he'll be able to carry it off.\'94 
\par \'93You don't want him to, eh?\'94 the Baron asked.
\par \'93Don't distract me,\'94 Piter said. \'93
While Hawat's occupied with the Lady Jessica, we'll divert him further with uprisings in a few garrison towns and the like. These will be put down. The Duke must believe he's gaining a measure of security. Then, when the moment is r
ipe, we'll signal Yueh and move in with our major force\'85 ah\'85 \'94 
\par \'93Go ahead, tell him all of it,\'94 the Baron said.
\par \'93We'll move in strengthened by two legions of Sardaukar disguised in Harkonnen livery.\'94
\par \'93Sardaukar!\'94 Feyd-Rautha breathed. His mind focused on the dread Imperial troops, the killers without mercy, the soldier fanatics of the Padishah Emperor.
\par \'93You see how I trust you, Feyd,\'94 the Baron said. \'93No hint of this must ever reach another Great House, else the Landsraad might unite against the Imperial House and there'd be chaos.\'94 
\par \'93The main point,\'94 Piter said, \'93is this: since House Harkonnen is being used to do the Imperial dirty work, we've gained a true advantage. It's a dangerous advantage, to be sure, but if used cautiously, will bring House Harkonnen
 greater wealth than that of any other House in the Imperium.\'94
\par \'93You have no idea how much wealth is involved, Feyd,\'94 the Baron said. \'93Not in your wildest imaginings. To begin, we'll have an irrevocable directorship in the CHOAM Company.\'94 
\par Feyd-Rautha nodded. Wealth was the thing. CHOAM was the key to wealth, each noble House dipping from the company's coffers whatever it could under the power of the directorships. Those CHOAM directorships \endash 
 they were the real evidence of political power in the Imperium, passing with the shifts of voting strength within the Landsraad as it balanced itself against the Emperor and his supporters.
\par \'93The Duke Leto,\'94 Piter said, \'93may attempt to flee to the new Fremen scum along the desert's edge. Or he may try to send his family into that imagined security. But that path is blocked by one of His Majesty's agents \endash 
 the planetary ecologist. You may remember him \endash  Kynes.\'94 
\par \'93Feyd remembers him,\'94 the Baron said. \'93Get on with it.\'94 
\par \'93You do not drool very prettily, Baron,\'94 Piter said. 
\par \'93Get on with it, I command you!\'94 the Baron roared.
\par Piter shrugged. \'93If matters go as planned,\'94 he said, \'93House Harkonnen will have a subfief on Arrakis within a Standard year. Your uncle will have dispensation of that fief. His own personal agent will rule on Arrakis.\'94 
\par \'93More profits,\'94 Feyd-Rautha said.
\par \'93Indeed,\'94 the Baron said. And he thought: It's only just. We're the ones who tamed Arrakis\'85except for the few mongrel Fremen hiding in the skirts of the desert\'85 and some tame smugglers bound to the planet almo
st as tightly as the native labor pool.
\par \'93And the Great Houses will know that the Baron has destroyed the Atreides,\'94 Piter said. \'93They will know.\'94 
\par \'93They will know,\'94 the Baron breathed.
\par \'93Loveliest of all,\'94 Piter said, \'93is that the Duke will know, too. He knows now. He can already feel the trap.\'94
\par \'93It's true the Duke knows,\'94 the Baron said, and his voice held a note of sadness. \'93He could not help but know\'85 more's the pity.\'94
\par The Baron moved out and away from the globe of Arrakis. As he emerged from the shadows, his figure took on dimension \endash 
 grossly and immensely fat. And with subtle bulges beneath folds of his dark robes to reveal that all this fat was sustained partly by portable suspensors harnessed to his flesh. He might weigh two hundred Standard kilos in a
ctuality, but his feet would carry no more than fifty of them.
\par \'93I am hungry,\'94 the Baron rumbled, and he rubbed his protruding lips with a beringed hand, stared down at Feyd-Rautha through fat-enfolded eyes. \'93Send for food, my darling. We will eat before we retire.\'94
\par 
\par 
\par Thus spoke St. Alia-of-the-Knife: \'93The Reverend Mother must combine the seductive wiles of a courtesan with the untouchable majesty of a virgin goddess, holding these attributes in tension so long as the powers of her youth endure. For when you
th and beauty have gone, she will find that the place-between, once occupied by tension, has become a wellspring of cunning and resourcefulness.\'94
\par -from \'93Muad'Dib, Family Commentaries\'94 by the Princess Irulan
\par 
\par \'93Well, Jessica, what have you to say for yourself?\'94 asked the Reverend Mother.
\par It was near sunset at Castle Caladan on the day of Paul's ordeal. The two women were alone in Jessica's morning room while Paul waited in the adjoining soundproofed Meditation Chamber.
\par Jessica stood facing the south windows. She saw and yet did not see the evening's banked colors across meadow and river. She heard and yet did not hear the Reverend Mother's question.
\par There had been another ordeal once \endash  so many years ago. A skinny girl with hair the color of bronze, her body to
rtured by the winds of puberty, had entered the study of the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, Proctor Superior of the Bene Gesserit school on Wallach IX. Jessica looked down at her right hand, flexed the fingers, remembering the pain, the terror, the a
nger. 
\par \'93Poor Paul,\'94 she whispered.
\par \'93I asked you a question, Jessica!\'94 The old woman's voice was snappish, demanding.
\par \'93What? Oh\'85 \'94 Jessica tore her attention away from the past, faced the Reverend Mother, who sat with back to the stone wall between the two west windows. \'93What do you want me to say?\'94 
\par \'93What do I want you to say? What do I want you to say?\'94 The old voice carried a tone of cruel mimicry.
\par \'93So I had a son!\'94 Jessica flared. And she knew she was being goaded into this anger deliberately.
\par \'93You were told to bear only daughters to the Atreides.\'94 
\par \'93It meant so much to him,\'94 Jessica pleaded.
\par \'93And you in your pride thought you could produce the Kwisatz Haderach!\'94 
\par Jessica lifted her chin. \'93I sensed the possibility.\'94 
\par \'93You thought only of your Duke's desire for a son,\'94 the old woman snapped. \'93
And his desires don't figure in this. An Atreides daughter could've been wed to a Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach. You've hopelessly complicated matters. We may lose both bloodlines now.\'94
\par \'93You're not infallible,\'94 Jessica said. She braved the steady stare from the old eyes.
\par Presently, the old woman muttered: \'93What's done is done.\'94 
\par \'93I vowed never to regret my decision,\'94 Jessica said.
\par \'93How noble,\'94 the Reverend Mother sneered. \'93No regrets. We shall see when you're a fugitive with a price on your head and every man's hand turned against you to seek your life and the life of your son.\'94 
\par Jessica paled. \'93Is there no alternative?\'94 
\par \'93Alternative? A Bene Gesserit should ask that?\'94 
\par \'93I ask only what you see in the future with your superior abilities.\'94
\par \'93I see in the future what I've seen in the past. You well know the pattern of our affairs, Jessica. The race knows its own mortality and fears stagnation of its heredity. It's in the bloodstream \endash  the urge to mingle genetic strains
 without plan. The Imperium, the CHOAM Company, all the Great Houses, they are but bits of flotsam in the path of the flood.\'94
\par \'93CHOAM,\'94 Jessica muttered. \'93I suppose it's already decided how they'll redivide the spoils of Arrakis.\'94
\par \'93What is CHOAM but the weather vane of our times,\'94 the old woman said. \'93
The Emperor and his friends now command fifty-nine point six-five per cent of the CHOAM directorship's votes. Certainly they smell profits, and likely as others smell those same profits his voting strength will
 increase. This is the pattern of history, girl.\'94
\par \'93That's certainly what I need right now,\'94 Jessica said. \'93A review of history.\'94
\par \'93Don't be facetious, girl! You know as well as I do what forces surround us. We've a three-point civilization: the Imperial Hou
sehold balanced against the Federated Great Houses of the Landsraad, and between them, the Guild with its damnable monopoly on interstellar transport. In politics, the tripod is the most unstable of all structures. It'd be bad enough without the complicat
ion of a feudal trade culture which turns its back on most science.\'94 
\par Jessica spoke bitterly: \'93Chips in the path of the flood \endash  and this chip here, this is the Duke Leto, and this one's his son, and this one's \endash \'94
\par \'93Oh, shut up, girl. You entered this with full knowledge of the delicate edge you walked.\'94 
\par \'93 \lquote I am Bene Gesserit: I exist only to serve,\rquote  \'93 Jessica quoted. 
\par \'93Truth.\'94 the old woman said. \'93And all we can hope for now is to prevent this from erupting into general conflagration, to salvage what we can of the key bloodlines.\'94
\par Jessica closed her eyes, feeling tears press out beneath the lids. She fought down the inner trembling, the outer trembling, the uneven breathing, the ragged pulse, the sweating of the palms. Presently, she said, \'93I'll pay for my own mistake.\'94 

\par \'93And your son will pay with you.\'94 
\par \'93I'll shield him as well as I'm able.\'94
\par \'93Shield!\'94 the old woman snapped. \'93You well know the weakness there! Shield your son too much, Jessica, and he'll not grow strong enough to fulfill any destiny.\'94
\par Jessica turned away, looked out the window at the gathering darkness. \'93Is it really that terrible, this planet of Arrakis?\'94 
\par \'93Bad enough, but not all bad. The Missionaria Protectiva has been in there and softened it up somewhat.\'94 The Reverend Mother heaved herself to her feet, straightened a fold in her gown. \'93Call the boy in here. I must be leaving soon.\'94 
\par \'93Must you?\'94
\par The old woman's voice softened. \'93Jessica, girl, I wish I could stand in your place and take your sufferings. But each of us must make her own path.\'94 
\par \'93I know.\'94
\par \'93You're as dear to me as any of my own daughters, but I cannot let that interfere with duty.\'94 
\par \'93I understand\'85 the necessity.\'94
\par \'93What you did, Jessica, and why you did it \endash  we both know. But kindness forces me to tell you there's little chance your lad will be the Bene Gesserit Totality. You mustn't let yourself hope too much.\'94
\par Jessica shook tears from the corners of her eyes. It was an angry gesture. \'93You make me feel like a little girl again \endash  reciting my first lesson.\'94 She forced the words out: \'93 \lquote Humans must never submit to animals.\rquote  \'93
 A dry sob shook her. In a low voice, she said: \'93I've been so lonely.\'94
\par \'93It should be one of the tests,\'94 the old woman said. \'93Humans are almost always lonely. Now summon the boy. He's had a long, frightening day. But he's had time to think and remember, and I must ask the other questions about these dreams of his.
\'94 
\par Jessica nodded, went to the door of the Meditation Chamber, opened it. \'93Paul, come in now, please.\'94
\par Paul emerged with a stubborn slowness. He stared at 
his mother as though she were a stranger. Wariness veiled his eyes when he glanced at the Reverend Mother, but this time he nodded to her, the nod one gives an equal. He heard his mother close the door behind him.
\par \'93Young man,\'94 the old woman said, \'93let's return to this dream business.\'94 
\par \'93What do you want?\'94 
\par \'93Do you dream every night?\'94
\par \'93Not dreams worth remembering. I can remember every dream, but some are worth remembering and some aren't.\'94 
\par \'93How do you know the difference?\'94 
\par \'93I just know it.\'94
\par The old woman glanced at Jessica, back to Paul. \'93What did you dream last night? Was it worth remembering?\'94
\par \'93Yes.\'94 Paul closed his eyes. \'93I dreamed a cavern\'85 and water\'85 and a girl there \endash  very skinny with big eyes. Her eyes are all blue, no whites in them. I talk to her and tell her about you, about seeing the Reverend Mother on Caladan.
\'94 Paul opened his eyes.
\par \'93And the thing you tell this strange girl about seeing me, did it happen today?\'94
\par Paul thought about this, then: \'93Yes. I tell the girl you came and put a stamp of strangeness on me.\'94
\par \'93Stamp of strangeness,\'94 the old woman breathed, and again she shot a glance at Jessica, returned her attention to Paul. \'93Tell me truly now, Paul, do you often have dreams of things that happen afterward exactly as you dreamed them?\'94 
\par \'93Yes. And I've dreamed about that girl before.\'94 
\par \'93Oh? You know her?\'94 
\par \'93I will know her.\'94 
\par \'93Tell me about her.\'94
\par Again, Paul closed his eyes. \'93We're in a little place in some rocks where it's sheltered. It's almost night, but it's hot and I can see patches of sand out of an opening in the rocks. We're\'85 waiting for something\'85
 for me to go meet some people. And she's frightened but trying to hide it from me, and I'm excited. And she says: \lquote Tell me about the waters of your homeworld, Usul.\rquote  \'93 Paul opened his eyes. \'93
Isn't that strange? My homeworld's Caladan. I've never even heard of a planet called Usul.\'94  
\par \'93Is there more to this dream?\'94 Jessica prompted.
\par \'93Yes. But maybe she was calling me Usul,\'94 Paul said. \'93I just thought of that.\'94 Again, he closed his eyes. \'93She as
ks me to tell her about the waters. And I take her hand. And I say I'll tell her a poem. And I tell her the poem, but I have to explain some of the words \endash  like beach and surf and seaweed and seagulls.\'94 
\par \'93What poem?\'94 the Reverend Mother asked.
\par Paul opened his eyes. \'93It's just one of Gurney Halleck's tone poems for sad times.\'94 
\par Behind Paul Jessica began to recite:
\par 
\par \'93I remember salt smoke from a beach fire 
\par And shadows under the pines \endash 
\par Solid, clean\'85 fixed \endash 
\par Seagulls perched at the tip of land, 
\par White upon green\'85 
\par And a wind comes through the pines 
\par To sway the shadows; 
\par The seagulls spread their wings, 
\par Lift 
\par And fill the sky with screeches. 
\par And I hear the wind 
\par Blowing across our beach,
\par And the surf, 
\par And I see that our fire 
\par Has scorched the seaweed.\'94
\par 
\par \'93That's the one,\'94 Paul said.
\par The old woman stared at Paul, then: \'93Young man, as a Proctor of the Bene Gesserit, I seek the Kwisatz Haderach, the male who truly can become one of us. Your mother sees this possibility in you, but she sees with the eyes of a mot
her. Possibility I see, too, but no more.\'94
\par She fell silent and Paul saw that she wanted him to speak. He waited her out.
\par Presently, she said: \'93As you will, then. You've depths in you; that I'll grant.\'94 
\par \'93May I go now?\'94 he asked.
\par \'93Don't you want to hear what the Reverend Mother can tell you about the Kwisatz Haderach?\'94 Jessica asked. 
\par \'93She said those who tried for it died.\'94
\par \'93But I can help you with a few hints at why they failed,\'94 the Reverend Mother said.
\par She talks of hints, Paul thought. She doesn't really know anything. And he said: \'93Hint then.\'94
\par \'93And be damned to me?\'94 She smiled wryly, a crisscross of wrinkles in the old face. \'93Very well: \lquote That which submits rules.\rquote  \'93 
\par He felt astonishment: she was talking about such elementary things as tension within meaning. Did she think his mother had taught him nothing at all?
\par \'93That's a hint?\'94 he asked.
\par \'93We're not here to bandy words or quibble over their meaning,\'94 the old woman said. \'93The willow submits to the wind and prospers until one day it is many willows \endash  a wall against the wind. This is the willow's purpose.\'94
\par Paul stared at her. She said purpose and he felt the word buffet him, reinfecting him with terrible purpose. He experienced a sudden anger at her: fatuous old witch with her mouth full of platitudes.
\par \'93You think I could be this Kwisatz Haderach,\'94 he said. \'93You talk about me, but you haven't said one thing about what we can do to help my father. I've heard you talking to my mother. You talk as though my father were dead. Well, he isn't!\'94

\par \'93If there were a thing to be done for him, we'd have done it,\'94 the old woman growled. \'93
We may be able to salvage you. Doubtful, but possible. But for your father, nothing. When you've learned to accept that as a fact, you've learned a real Bene Gesserit lesson.\'94
\par Paul saw how the words shook his mother. He glared at the old woman. How could she say such a thing about his father? What made her so sure? His mind seethed with resentment.
\par The Reverend Mother looked at Jessica. \'93You've been training him in the Way \endash  I've seen the signs of it. I'd have done the same in your shoes and devil take the Rules.\'94 
\par Jessica nodded.
\par \'93Now, I caution you,\'94 said the old woman, \'93to ignore the regular order of training. His own safety requires the Voice. He already has a good start in it, but we both know how much more he needs\'85 and that desperately.\'94
 She stepped close to Paul, stared down at him. \'93Goodbye, young human. I hope you make it. But if you don't \endash  well, we shall yet succeed.\'94
\par Once more she looked at Jessica. A flicker sign of understanding passed between them. Then the old woman swept from the room, her robes hissing, with not another backward glance. The room and its occupants already were shut from her thoughts.
\par But Jessica had caught one glimpse of the Reverend Mother's face as she turned away. There had been tears on the seamed cheeks. The tears were more unnerving than any other word or sign that had passed between them this day.
\par 
\par 
\par You have read that Muad'Dib had no playmates his own age on Caladan. The dangers were too great. But Muad'
Dib did have wonderful companion-teachers. There was Gurney Halleck, the troubadour-warrior. You will sing some of Gurney's songs, as you read along in this book. There was Thufir Hawat, the old Mentat Master of Assassins, who struck fear even into the he
art of the Padishah Emperor. There were Duncan Idaho, the Swordmaster of the Ginaz; Dr. Wellington Yueh, a name black in treachery but bright in knowledge; the Lady Jessica, who guided her son in the Bene Gesserit Way, and \endash  of course \endash 
 the Duke Leto, whose qualities as a father have long been overlooked.
\par -from \'93A Child's History of Muad'Dib\'94 by the Princess Irulan
\par 
\par Thufir Hawat slipped into the training room of Castle Caladan, closed the door softly. He stood there a moment, feeling old and tired and storm-leathered. His left leg ached where it had been slashed once in the service of the Old Duke.
\par Three generations of them now, he thought.
\par He stared across the big room bright with the light of noon pouring through the skylights, saw the boy seated with back to the door, intent on papers and charts spread across an ell table.
\par How many times must I tell that lad never to settle himself with his back to a door? Hawat cleared his throat. 
\par Paul remained bent over his studies.
\par A cloud shadow passed over the skylights. Again, Hawat cleared his throat.
\par Paul straightened, spoke without turning: \'93I know. I'm sitting with my back to a door.\'94 
\par Hawat suppressed a smile, strode across the room.
\par Paul looked up at the grizzled old man who stopped at a corner of the table. Hawat's eyes were two pools of alertness in a dark and deeply seamed face.
\par \'93I heard you coming down the hall,\'94 Paul said. \'93And I heard you open the door.\'94 
\par \'93The sounds I make could be imitated.\'94 
\par \'93I'd know the difference.\'94
\par He might at that, Hawat thought. That witch-mother of his is giving him the deep training, certainly. I wonder what her precious school thinks of that? Maybe that's why they sent the old Proctor here \endash  to whip our dear Lady Jessica into line.

\par Hawat pulled up a chair across from Paul, sat dow
n facing the door. He did it pointedly, leaned back and studied the room. It struck him as an odd place suddenly, a stranger-place with most of its hardware already gone off to Arrakis. A training table remained, and a fencing mirror with its crystal pris
ms quiescent, the target dummy beside it patched and padded, looking like an ancient foot soldier maimed and battered in the wars. 
\par There stand I, Hawat thought.
\par \'93Thufir, what're you thinking?\'94 Paul asked.
\par Hawat looked at the boy. \'93I was thinking we'll all be out of here soon and likely never see the place again.\'94 
\par \'93Does that make you sad?\'94
\par \'93Sad? Nonsense! Parting with friends is a sadness. A place is only a place.\'94 He glanced at the charts on the table. \'93And Arrakis is just another place.\'94 
\par \'93Did my father send you up to test me?\'94
\par Hawat scowled \endash  the boy had such observing ways about him. He nodded. \'93You're thinking it'd have been nicer if he'd come up himself, but you must know how busy he is. He'll be along later.\'94 
\par \'93I've been studying about the storms on Arrakis.\'94 
\par \'93The storms. I see.\'94 
\par \'93They sound pretty bad.\'94
\par \'93That's too cautious a word: bad. Those storms build up across six or seven thousand kilometers of flatlands, feed on anything that can give them a push \endash  coriolis force, other storms, anything that 
has an ounce of energy in it. They can blow up to seven hundred kilometers an hour, loaded with everything loose that's in their way \endash  sand, dust, everything. They can eat flesh off bones and etch the bones to slivers.\'94 
\par \'93Why don't they have weather control?\'94
\par \'93Arrakis has special problems, costs are higher, and there'd be maintenance and the like. The Guild wants a dreadful high price for satellite control and your father's House isn't one of the big rich ones, lad. You know that.\'94 
\par \'93Have you ever seen the Fremen?\'94 
\par The lad's mind is darting all over today, Hawat thought.
\par \'93Like as not I have seen them,\'94 he said. \'93There's little to tell them from the folk of the graben and sink. They all wear those great flowing robes. And they stink to heaven in any closed space. It's from those suits they wear  \endash 
 call them \lquote stillsuits\rquote  \endash  that reclaim the body's own water.\'94
\par Paul swallowed, suddenly aware of the moisture in his mouth, remembering a dream of thirst. That people could want so for water they had to recycle their body moisture struck him with a feeling of desolation. \'93Water's precious there,\'94 he said.

\par Hawat nodded, thinking: Perhaps I'm doing it, getting across to him the importance of this planet as an enemy. It's madness to go in there without that caution in our minds.
\par Paul looked up at the skylight, aware that it had begun to rain. He saw the spreading wetness on the gray meta-glass. \'93Water,\'94 he said.
\par \'93You'll learn a great concern for water,\'94 Hawat said. \'93As the Duke's son you'll never want for it, but you'll see the pressures of thirst all around you.\'94
\par Paul wet his lips with his tongue, thinking back to the day a week ago and the ordeal with the Reverend Mother. She, too, had said something about water starvation.
\par \'93You'll learn about the funeral plains,\'94 she'd said, \'93
about the wilderness that is empty, the wasteland where nothing lives except the spice and the sandworms. You'll stain your eyepits to reduce the sun glare. Shelter will mean a hollow out of the wind and hidden from view. You'll ride upon your own tw
o feet without \lquote thopter or groundcar or mount.\'94
\par And Paul had been caught more by her tone \endash  singsong and wavering \endash  than by her words.
\par \'93When you live upon Arrakis,\'94 she had said, \'93khala, the land is empty. The moons will be your friends, the sun your enemy.\'94 
\par Paul had sensed his mother come up beside him away from her post guarding the door. She had looked at the Reverend Mother and asked: \'93Do you see no hope. Your Reverence?\'94
\par \'93Not for the father.\'94 And the old woman had waved Jessica to silence, looked down at Paul. \'93Grave this on your memory, lad: A world is supported by four things\'85 \'94 She held up four big-knuckled fingers. \'93\'85
 the learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of the brave. But all of these are as nothing\'85 \'94 She closed her fingers into a fist. \'93\'85
 without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science of your tradition!\'94
\par A week had passed since that day with the Reverend Mother. Her words were only now beginning to come into full register. Now, sitting in the training room with Thufir Hawat, Paul felt a sharp pang of fear. He looked across at the Mentat's puzzled frown.

\par \'93Where were you woolgathering that time?\'94 Hawat asked.
\par \'93Did you meet the Reverend Mother?\'94
\par \'93That Truthsayer witch from the Imperium?\'94 Hawat's eyes quickened with interest. \'93I met her.\'94
\par \'93She\'85 \'94 Paul hesitated, found that he couldn't tell Hawat about the ordeal. The inhibitions went deep. 
\par \'93Yes? What did she?\'94
\par Paul took two deep breaths. \'93She said a thing.\'94 He closed his eyes, calling up the words, and when he spoke his voice unconsciously took on some of the old woman's tone: \'93 \lquote 
You, Paul Atreides, descendant of kings, son of a Duke, you must learn to rule. It's something none of your ancestors learned.\rquote  \'93 Paul opened his eyes, said: \'93That made me angry and I said my father rules an entire planet. And she said, 
\lquote He's losing it.\rquote  And I said my father was getting a richer planet. And she said. \lquote He'll lose that one, too.\rquote  And I wanted to run and warn my father, but she said he'd already been warned \endash 
 by you, by Mother, by many people.\'94 
\par \'93True enough,\'94 Hawat muttered. 
\par \'93Then why're we going?\'94 Paul demanded.
\par \'93Because the Emperor ordered it. And because there's hope in spite of what that witch-spy said. What else spouted from this ancient fountain of wisdom?\'94
\par Paul looked down at his right hand clenched into a fist beneath the table. Slowly, he willed the muscles to relax. She put some kind of hold on me, he thought. How?
\par \'93She asked me to tell her what it is to rule,\'94 Paul said. \'93And I said that one commands. And she said I had some unlearning to do.\'94
\par She hit a mark there right enough, Hawat thought. He nodded for Paul to continue.
\par \'93She said a ruler must learn to persuade and not to compel. She said he must lay the best coffee hearth to attract the finest men.\'94 
\par \'93How'd she figure your father attracted men like Duncan and Gurney?\'94 Hawat asked.
\par Paul shrugged. \'93Then she said a good ruler has to learn his world's language, that it's different for every world. And I thought she meant they did
n't speak Galach on Arrakis, but she said that wasn't it at all. She said she meant the language of the rocks and growing things, the language you don't hear just with your ears. And I said that's what Dr. Yueh calls the Mystery of Life.\'94 
\par Hawat chuckled. \'93How'd that sit with her?\'94
\par \'93I think she got mad. She said the mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience. So I quoted the First Law of Mentat at her: \lquote A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with th
e flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.\rquote  That seemed to satisfy her.\'94
\par He seems to be getting over it, Hawat thought, but that old witch frightened him. Why did she do it?
\par \'93Thufir,\'94 Paul said, \'93will Arrakis be as bad as she said?\'94 
\par \'93Nothing could be that bad,\'94 Hawat said and forced a smile. \'93
Take those Fremen, for example, the renegade people of the desert. By first-approximation analysis, I can tell you there're many, many more of them than the Imperium suspects. People live there, lad: a great many people, and\'85\'94
 Hawat put a sinewy finger beside his eye. \'93\'85 they hate Harkonnens with a bloody passion. You must not breathe a word of this, lad. I tell you only as your father's helper.\'94
\par \'93My father has told me of Salusa Secundus,\'94 Paul said. \'93Do you know, Thufir, it sounds much like Arrakis\'85 perhaps not quite as bad, but much like it.\'94
\par \'93We do not really know of Salusa Secundus today,\'94 Hawat said. \'93Only what it was like long ago\'85 mostly. But what is known \endash  you're right on that score.\'94
\par \'93Will the Fremen help us?\'94
\par \'93It's a possibility.\'94 Hawat stood up. \'93I leave today for Arrakis. Meanwhile, you take care of yourself for an old man who's fond of you, heh? Come around here like the good lad and sit facing the door. It's not that I think there's any danger i
n the castle; it's just a habit I want you to form.\'94
\par Paul got to his feet, moved around the table. \'93You're going today?\'94
\par \'93Today it is, and you'll be following tomorrow. Next time we meet it'll be on the soil of your new world.\'94 He gripped Paul's right arm at the bicep. \'93Keep your knife arm free, heh? And your shield at full charge.\'94
 He released the arm, patted Paul's shoulder, whirled and strode quickly to the door. 
\par \'93Thufir! \'93Paul called.
\par Hawat turned, standing in the open doorway. 
\par \'93Don't sit with your back to any doors,\'94 Paul said.
\par A grin spread across the seamed old face. \'93That I won't, lad. Depend on it.\'94 And he was gone, shutting the door softly behind.
\par Paul sat down where Hawat had been, straightened the papers. One more day here, he thought. He looked around the room. We \lquote 
re leaving. The idea of departure was suddenly more real to him than it had ever been before. He recalled another thing the old woman had said about a world being the sum of many things \endash  the people, the dirt, the growing things, the
 moons, the tides, the suns \endash  the unknown sum called nature, a vague summation without any sense of the now. And he wondered: What is the now?
\par The door across from Paul banged open and an ugly lump of a man lurched through it preceded by a handful of weapons.
\par \'93Well, Gurney Halleck,\'94 Paul called, \'93are you the new weapons master?\'94
\par Halleck kicked the door shut with one heel. \'93You'd rather I came to play games, I know,\'94 he said. He glanced abound the room, noting that Hawat's men already had been over it, check
ing, making it safe for a duke's heir. The subtle code signs were all around.
\par Paul watched the rolling, ugly man set himself back in motion, veer toward the training table with the load of weapons, saw the nine-string baliset slung over Gurney's shoulder with the multipick woven through the strings near the head of the fingerboard.

\par Halleck dropped the weapons on the exercise table, lined them up \endash  the rapiers, the bodkins, the kindjals, the slow-pellet stunners, the shield belts. The inkvine scar along his jawline writhed as he turned, casting a smile across the room.
\par \'93So you don't even have a good morning for me, you young imp,\'94 Halleck said. \'93And what barb did you sink in old Hawat? He passed me in the hall like a man running to his enemy's funeral.\'94 
\par Paul grinned. Of all his father's men, he liked Gurney Halleck best, knew the man's moods and deviltry, his humors, and thought of him more as a friend than as a hired sword.
\par Halleck swung the baliset off his shoulder, began tuning it. \'93If y\rquote  won't talk, y\rquote  won't,\'94 he said.
\par Paul stood, advanced across the room, calling out: \'93Well, Gurney, do we come prepared for music when it's fighting time?\'94 
\par \'93So it's sass for our elders today,\'94 Halleck said. He tried a chord on the instrument, nodded.
\par \'93Where's Duncan Idaho?\'94 Paul asked. \'93Isn't he supposed to be teaching me weaponry?\'94
\par \'93Duncan's gone to lead the second wave onto Arrakis,\'94 Halleck said. \'93All you have left is poor Gurney who's fresh out of fight and spoiling for music.\'94 He struck another chord, listened to it, smiled. \'93
And it was decided in council that you being such a poor fighter we'd best teach you the music trade so's you won't waste your life entire.\'94
\par \'93Maybe you'd better sing me a lay then,\'94 Paul said. \'93I want to be sure how not to do it.\'94
\par \'93Ah-h-h, hah!\'94 Gurney laughed, and he swung into \'93Galacian Girls.\'94 his multipick a blur over the strings as he sang:
\par 
\par \'93Oh-h-h, the Galacian girls 
\par Will do it for pearls, 
\par And the Arrakeen for water! 
\par But if you desire dames 
\par Like consuming flames, 
\par Try a Caladanin daughter!\'94
\par 
\par \'93Not bad for such a poor hand with the pick,\'94 Paul said, \'93but if my mother heard you singing a bawdy like that in the castle, she'd have your ears on the outer wall for decoration.\'94 
\par Gurney pulled at his left ear. \'93Poor decoration, too, they having been bruised so much listening at keyholes while a young lad I know practiced some strange ditties on his baliset.\'94
\par \'93So you've forgotten what it's like to find sand in your bed,\'94 Paul said. He pulled a shield belt from the table, buckled it fast around his waist. \'93Then, let's fight!\'94
\par Halleck's eyes went wide in mock surprise. \'93So! It was your wicked hand did that deed! Guard yourself today, young master \endash  guard yourself.\'94 He grabbed up a rapier, laced the air with it. \'93I'm a hellfiend out for revenge!\'94
\par Paul lifted the companion rapier, bent it in his hands, stood in the aguile, one foot forward. He let his manner go solemn in a comic imitation of Dr. Yueh.
\par \'93What a dolt my father sends me for weaponry,\'94 Paul intoned. \'93This doltish Gurney Halleck has forgotten the first lesson for a fighting man armed and shielded.\'94
 Paul snapped the force button at his waist, felt the crinkled-skin tingling of the defensive field at his forehead and down his back, heard external sounds take on characteristic shield-filtered flatness. \'93
In shield fighting, one moves fast on defense, slow on attack,\'94 Paul said. \'93Attack has the sole purpose of tricking the opponent into a misstep, setting him up for the attack sinister. The shield turns the fast blow, admits the slow kindjal!\'94
 Paul snapped up the rapier, feinted fast and whipped it back for a slow thrust timed to enter a shield's mindless defenses.
\par Halleck watched the action, turned at the last minute to let the blunted blade pass his chest. \'93Speed, excellent,\'94 he said. \'93But you were wide open for an underhanded counter with a slip-tip.\'94 
\par Paul stepped back, chagrined.
\par \'93I should whap your backside for such carelessness,\'94 Halleck said. He lifted a naked kindjal from the table and held it up. \'93This in the hand of an enemy can let out your l
ife's blood! You're an apt pupil, none better, but I've warned you that not even in play do you let a man inside your guard with death in his hand.\'94
\par \'93I guess I'm not in the mood for it today,\'94 Paul said.
\par \'93Mood?\'94 Halleck's voice betrayed his outrage even through the shield's filtering. \'93What has mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises \endash 
 no matter the mood! Mood's a thing for cattle or making love or playing the baliset. It's not for fighting.\'94 
\par \'93I'm sorry, Gurney.\'94 
\par \'93You're not sorry enough!\'94
\par Halleck activated his own shield, crouched with kindjal outthrust in left hand, the rapier poised high in his right. \'93Now I say guard yourself for true!\'94 He leaped high to one side, then forward, pressing a furious attack.
\par Paul fell back, parrying. He fel
t the field crackling as shield edges touched and repelled each other, sensed the electric tingling of the contact along his skin. What's gotten into Gurney? he asked himself. He's not faking this! Paul moved his left hand, dropped his bodkin into his pal
m from its wrist sheath.
\par \'93You see a need for an extra blade, eh?\'94 Halleck grunted. 
\par Is this betrayal? Paul wondered. Surely not Gurney!
\par Around the room they fought \endash  thrust and parry, feint and counterfeint. The air within their shield bubbles grew stale fr
om the demands on it that the slow interchange along barrier edges could not replenish. With each new shield contact, the smell of ozone grew stronger.
\par Paul continued to back, but now he directed his retreat toward the exercise table. If I can turn him beside the table, I'll show him a trick, Paul thought. One more step, Gurney. 
\par Halleck took the step.
\par Paul directed a parry downward, turned, saw Halleck's rapier catch against the table's edge. Paul flung himself aside, thrust high with rapier and came in across Halleck's neckline with the bodkin. He stopped the blade an inch from the jugular. 
\par \'93Is this what you seek?\'94 Paul whispered. 
\par \'93Look down, lad,\'94 Gurney panted.
\par Paul obeyed, saw Halleck's kindjal thrust under the table's edge, the tip almost touching Paul's groin.
\par \'93We'd have joined each other in death,\'94 Halleck said. \'93But I'll admit you fought some better when pressed to it. You seemed to get the mood.\'94 And he grinned wolfishly, the inkvine scar rippling along his jaw.
\par \'93The way you came at me,\'94 Paul said. \'93Would you really have drawn my blood?\'94
\par Halleck withdrew the kindjal, straightened. \'93If you'd fought one whit beneath your abilities. I'd have scratched you a good one, a scar you'd remember. I'll not have my favorite pupil fall to the first Harkonnen tramp who happens along.\'94
\par Paul deactivated his shield, leaned on the table to catch his breath. \'93I deserved that, Gurney. But it would've angered my father if you'd hurt me. I'll not have you punished for my failing.\'94 
\par \'93As to that,\'94 Halleck said, \'93it was my failing, too. And you needn't worry about a training scar or two. You're lucky you have so few. As to your father \endash 
 the Duke'd punish me only if I failed to make a first-class fighting man out of you. And I'd have been failing there if I hadn't explained the fallacy in this mood thing you've suddenly developed.\'94 
\par Paul straightened, slipped his bodkin back into its wrist sheath. 
\par \'93It's not exactly play we do here,\'94 Halleck said.
\par Paul nodded. He felt a sense of wonder at the uncharacteristic seriousness in Ha
lleck's manner, the sobering intensity. He looked at the beet-colored inkvine scar on the man's jaw, remembering the story of how it had been put there by Beast Rabban in a Harkonnen slave pit on Giedi Prime. And Paul felt a sudden shame that he had doubt
ed Halleck even for an instant. It occurred to Paul, then, that the making of Halleck's scar had been accompanied by pain \endash  a pain as intense, perhaps, as that inflicted by a Reverend Mother. He thrust this thought aside; it chilled their world.

\par \'93I guess I did hope for some play today,\'94 Paul said. \'93Things are so serious around here lately.\'94
\par Halleck turned away to hide his emotions. Something burned in his eyes. There was pain in him \endash  like a blister, all that was left of some lost yesterday that Time had pruned off him.
\par How soon this child must assume his manhood, Halleck thought. How soon he must read that form within his mind, that contract of brutal caution, to enter the necessary fact on the necessary line: \'93Please list your next of kin.\'94
\par Halleck spoke without turning: \'93I sensed the play in you, lad, and I'd like nothing better than to join in it. But this no longer can be play. Tomorrow we go to Arrakis. Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.\'94 
\par Paul touched his forehead with his rapier blade held vertical.
\par Halleck turned, saw the salute and acknowledged it with a nod. He gestured to the practice dummy. \'93Now, we'll work on your timing. Let me see you catch that thing sinister. I'll control it from over here where I can have a full view of the action. And
 I warn you I'll be trying new counters today. There's a warning you'd not get from a real enemy.\'94
\par Paul stretched up on his toes to relieve his muscles. He felt solemn with the sudden realization that his life had become filled with swift changes. He cross
ed to the dummy, slapped the switch on its chest with his rapier tip and felt the defensive field forcing his blade away.
\par \'93En garde!\'94 Halleck called, and the dummy pressed the attack. 
\par Paul activated his shield, parried and countered.
\par Halleck watched as he manipulated the controls. His mind seemed to be in two parts: one alert to the needs of the training fight, and the other wandering in fly-buzz.
\par I'm the well-trained fruit tree, he thought. Full of well-trained feelings and abilities and all of them grafted onto me \endash  all bearing for someone else to pick.
\par For some reason, he recalled his younger sister, her elfin face so clear in his mind. But she was dead now \endash  in a pleasure house for Harkonnen troops. She had loved pansies\'85 or was it daisies? He couldn't 
remember. It bothered him that he couldn't remember.
\par Paul countered a slow swing of the dummy, brought up his left hand entretisser.
\par That clever little devil! Halleck thought, intent now on Paul's interweaving hand motions. He's been practicing and studying on his own. That's not Duncan's style, and it's certainly nothing I've taught him.
\par This thought only added to Halleck's sadness. I'm infected by mood, he thought. And he began to wonder about Paul, if the boy ever listened fearfully to his pillow throbbing in the night. 
\par \'93If wishes were fishes we'd all cast nets,\'94 he murmured.
\par It was his mother's expression and he always used it when he felt the blackness of tomorrow on him. Then he thought what an odd expression that was to be taking to a planet that had never known seas or fishes.

\par -from \'93Dictionary of Muad'Dib\'94 by the Princess Irulan
\par 
\par Although he heard Dr. Yueh enter the training room, noting the stiff deliberation of the man's pace, Paul remained stretched out face down on 
the exercise table where the masseuse had left him. He felt deliciously relaxed after the workout with Gurney Halleck.
\par \'93You do look comfortable,\'94 said Yueh in his calm, high-pitched voice.
\par Paul raised his head, saw the man's stick figure standing several p
aces away, took in at a glance the wrinkled black clothing, the square block of a head with purple lips and drooping mustache, the diamond tattoo of Imperial Conditioning on his forehead, the long black hair caught in the Suk School's silver ring at the l
eft shoulder.
\par \'93You'll be happy to hear we haven't time for regular lessons today,\'94 Yueh said. \'93Your father will be along presently.\'94 
\par Paul sat up.
\par \'93However, I've arranged for you to have a filmbook viewer and several lessons during the crossing to Arrakis.\'94 
\par \'93Oh.\'94
\par Paul began pulling on his clothes. He felt excitement that his father would be coming. They had spent so little time together since the Emperor's command to take over the fief of Arrakis.
\par Yueh crossed to the ell table, thinking: How the boy has fil
led out these past few months. Such a waste! Oh, such a sad waste. And he reminded himself: I must not falter. What I do is done to be certain my Wanna no longer can be hurt by the Harkonnen beasts.
\par Paul joined him at the table, buttoning his jacket. \'93What'll I be studying on the way across?\'94
\par \'93Ah-h-h-h, the terranic life forms of Arrakis. The planet seems to have opened its arms to certain terranic life forms. It's not clear how. I must seek out the planetary ecologist when we arrive \endash  a Dr. Kynes \endash  and off
er my help in the investigation.\'94
\par And Yueh thought: What am I saying? I play the hypocrite even with myself.
\par \'93Will there be something on the Fremen?\'94 Paul asked.
\par \'93The Fremen?\'94 Yueh drummed his fingers on the table, caught Paul staring at the nervous motion, withdrew his hand.
\par \'93Maybe you have something on the whole Arrakeen population,\'94 Paul said.
\par \'93Yes, to be sure,\'94 Yueh said. \'93There are two general separations of the people \endash  Fremen, they are one group, and the others are the people of the graben, the sink,
 and the pan. There's some intermarriage, I'm told. The women of pan and sink villages prefer Fremen husbands; their men prefer Fremen wives. They have a saying: \lquote Polish comes from the cities; wisdom from the desert.\rquote  \'93
\par \'93Do you have pictures of them?\'94
\par \'93I'll see what I can get you. The most interesting feature, of course, is their eyes \endash  totally blue, no whites in them.\'94 
\par \'93Mutation?\'94 
\par \'93No; it's linked to saturation of the blood with melange.\'94 
\par \'93The Fremen must be brave to live at the edge of that desert.\'94 
\par \'93By all accounts,\'94 Yueh said. \'93They compose poems to their knives. Their women are as fierce as the men. Even Fremen children are violent and dangerous. You'll not be permitted to mingle with them, I daresay.\'94
\par Paul stared at Yueh, finding in these few glimpses of the Fremen a power of words that caught his entire attention. What a people to win as allies!
\par \'93And the worms?\'94 Paul asked. 
\par \'93What?\'94 
\par \'93I'd like to study more about the sandworms.\'94 
\par \'93Ah-h-h-h, to be sure. I've a filmbook on a small specimen, only one 
hundred and ten meters long and twenty-two meters in diameter. It was taken in the northern latitudes. Worms of more than four hundred meters in length have been recorded by reliable witnesses, and there's reason to believe even larger ones exist.\'94 

\par Paul glanced down at a conical projection chart of the northern Arrakeen latitudes spread on the table. \'93The desert belt and south polar regions are marked uninhabitable. Is it the worms?\'94 
\par \'93And the storms.\'94 
\par \'93But any place can be made habitable.\'94
\par \'93If it's economically feasible,\'94 Yueh said. \'93Arrakis has many costly perils.\'94 He smoothed his drooping mustache. \'93Your father will be here soon. Before I go, I've a gift for you, something I came across in packing.\'94
 He put an object on the table between them \endash  black, oblong, no larger than the end of Paul's thumb.
\par Paul looked at it. Yueh noted how the boy did not reach for it, and thought: How cautious he is.
\par \'93It's a very old Orange Catholic Bible made for space travelers. Not a filmbook, but actually printed on filament paper. It has its own magnifier and electrostatic charge system.\'94 He picked it up, demonstrated. \'93
The book is held closed by the charge, which forces against spring-locked covers. You press the edge \endash  thus, and the pages you've selected repel each other and the book opens.\'94 
\par \'93It's so small.\'94
\par \'93But it has eighteen hundred pages. You press the edge \endash  thus, and so\'85 and the charge moves ahead one page at a time as you read. Never touch the actual pages with your fingers. The filament tissue is too delicate.\'94 He
 closed the book, handed it to Paul. \'93Try it.\'94
\par Yueh watched Paul work the page adjustment, thought: I salve my own conscience. I give him the surcease of religion before betraying him. Thus may I say to myself that he has gone where I cannot go.
\par \'93This must've been made before filmbooks,\'94 Paul said.
\par \'93It's quite old. Let it be our secret, eh? Your parents might think it too valuable for one so young.\'94
\par And Yueh thought: His mother would surely wonder at my motives.
\par \'93Well\'85 \'94 Paul closed the book, held it in his hand. \'93If it's so valuable\'85 \'94
\par \'93Indulge an old man's whim,\'94 Yueh said. \'93It was given to me when I was very young.\'94 And he thought: I must catch his mind as well as his cupidity. \'93Open it to four-sixty-seven Kalima \endash  where it says: \lquote From water does all life
 begin.\rquote  There's a slight notch on the edge of the cover to mark the place.\'94
\par Paul felt the cover, detected two notches, one shallower than the other. He pressed the shallower one and the book spread open on his palm, its magnifier sliding into place. 
\par \'93Read it aloud,\'94 Yueh said.
\par Paul wet his lips with his tongue, read: \'93Think you of the fact that a deaf person cannot hear. Then, what deafness may we not all possess? What senses do we lack that we cannot see and cannot hear another world all around us? What 
is there around us that we cannot \endash \'94 
\par \'93Stop it!\'94 Yueh barked. 
\par Paul broke off, stared at him.
\par Yueh closed his eyes, fought to regain composure. What perversity caused the book to open at my Wanna's favorite passage? He opened his eyes, saw Paul staring at him.
\par \'93Is something wrong?\'94 Paul asked.
\par \'93I'm sorry,\'94 Yueh said. \'93That was\'85 my\'85 dead wife's favorite passage. It's not the one I intended you to read. It brings up memories that are\'85 painful.\'94 
\par \'93There are two notches,\'94 Paul said.
\par Of course, Yueh thought. Wanna marked her passage. His fingers are more sensitive than mine and found her mark. It was an accident, no more.
\par \'93You may find the book interesting,\'94 Yueh said. \'93It has much historical truth in it as well as good ethical philosophy.\'94 
\par Paul looked down at the tiny book in his palm \endash  such a small thing. Yet, it contained a mystery\'85 something had happened while he read from it. He had felt something stir his terrible purpose.
\par \'93Your father will be here any minute,\'94 Yueh said. \'93Put the book away and read it at your leisure.\'94
\par Paul touched the edge of it as Yueh had shown him. The book sealed itself. He slipped it into his tunic. For a moment there when Yueh had barked at him, Paul had feared the man would demand the book's return.
\par \'93I thank you for the gift. Dr. Yueh,\'94 Paul said, speaking formally. \'93It will be our secret. If there is a gift of favor you wish from me, please do not hesitate to ask.\'94 
\par \'93I\'85 need for nothing,\'94 Yueh said.
\par And he thought: Why do I stand here torturing myself? And torturing this poor lad\'85 though he does not know it. Oeyh! Damn those Harkonnen beasts! Why did they choose me for their abomination?

\par How do we approach the study of Muad'Dib's father? A man of surpassing warmth and surprising coldness was the Duke Leto Atreides. Yet
, many facts open the way to this Duke: his abiding love for his Bene Gesserit lady; the dreams he held for his son; the devotion with which men served him. You see him there \endash 
 a man snared by Destiny, a lonely figure with his light dimmed behind the glory of his son. Still, one must ask: What is the son but an extension of the father?
\par -from \'93Muad'Dib, Family Commentaries\'94 by the Princess Irulan
\par 
\par Paul watched his father enter the training room, saw the guards take up stations outside. One of them closed the door. As always, Paul experienced a sense of presence in his father, someone totally here.
\par The Duke was tall, olive-skinned. His thin face held harsh angles warmed only by deep gray eyes. He wore a black working uniform with red armorial hawk crest at the breast. A silvered shield belt with the patina of much use girded his narrow waist.
\par The Duke said: \'93Hard at work, Son?\'94
\par He crossed to the ell table, glanced at the papers on it, swept his gaze around the room and back to Paul. He felt tired, filled with t
he ache of not showing his fatigue. I must use every opportunity to rest during the crossing to Arrakis, he thought. There'll be no rest on Arrakis.
\par \'93Not very hard,\'94 Paul said. \'93Everything's so\'85 \'94 He shrugged.
\par \'93Yes. Well, tomorrow we leave. It'll be good to get settled in our new home, put all this upset behind.\'94
\par Paul nodded, suddenly overcome by memory of the Reverend Mother's words: \'93\'85 for the father, nothing.\'94
\par \'93Father,\'94 Paul said, \'93will Arrakis be as dangerous as everyone says?\'94
\par The Duke forced himself to the casual gesture, sat down on a corner of the table, smiled. A whole pattern of conversation welled up in his mind \endash 
 the kind of thing he might use to dispel the vapors in his men before a battle. The pattern froze before it could be vocalized, confronted by the single thought: 
\par This is my son.
\par \'93It'll be dangerous,\'94 he admitted.
\par \'93Hawat tells me we have a plan for the Fremen,\'94 Paul said. And he wondered: Why don't I tell him what that old woman said? How did she seal my tongue?
\par The Duke noted his son's distress, said: \'93As always, Hawat sees the main chance. But there's much more. I see also the Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles \endash 
 the CHOAM Company. By giving me Arrakis, His Majesty is forced to give us a CHOAM directorship\'85 a subtle gain.\'94 
\par \'93CHOAM controls the spice,\'94 Paul said.
\par \'93And Arrakis with its spice is our avenue into CHOAM,\'94 the Duke said. \'93There's more to CHOAM than melange.\'94 
\par \'93Did the Reverend Mother warn you?\'94 Paul blurted. He clenched his fists, feeling his palms slippery with perspiration. The effort it had taken to ask that question.
\par \'93Hawat tells me she frightened you with warnings about Arrakis,\'94 the Duke said. \'93Don't let a woman's fears cloud your mind. No woman wants her loved ones endangered. The hand behind those warnings was your
 mother's. Take this as a sign of her love for us.\'94 
\par \'93Does she know about the Fremen?\'94 
\par \'93Yes, and about much more.\'94 
\par \'93What?\'94
\par And the Duke thought: The truth could be worse than he imagines, but even dangerous facts are valuable if you've been trained to deal with them. And there's one place where nothing has been spared for my son \endash 
 dealing with dangerous facts. This must be leavened, though; he is young.
\par \'93Few products escape the CHOAM touch,\'94 the Duke said. \'93Logs, donkeys, horses, cows, lumber, dung, sharks, whale fur \endash  the most prosaic and the most exotic\'85
 even our poor pundi rice from Caladan. Anything the Guild will transport, the art forms of Ecaz, the machines of Richesse and Ix. But all fades before melange. A handful of spice will buy a home on Tupil
e. It cannot be manufactured, it must be mined on Arrakis. It is unique and it has true geriatric properties.\'94 
\par \'93And now we control it?\'94
\par \'93To a certain degree. But the important thing is to consider all the Houses that depend on CHOAM profits. And think of the enormous proportion of those profits dependent upon a single product \endash 
 the spice. Imagine what would happen if something should reduce spice production.\'94
\par \'93Whoever had stockpiled melange could make a killing,\'94 Paul said. \'93Others would be out in the cold.\'94
\par The Duke permitted himself a moment of grim satisfaction, looking at his son and thinking how penetrating, how truly educated that observation had been. He nodded. \'93The Harkonnens have been stockpiling for more than twenty years.\'94 
\par \'93They mean spice production to fail and you to be blamed.\'94
\par \'93They wish the Atreides name to become unpopular,\'94 the Duke said. \'93Think of the Landsraad Houses that look to me for a certain amount of leadership \endash  their unofficial spokesman. Think how they'd react if I were respons
ible for a serious reduction in their income. After all, one's own profits come first. The Great Convention be damned! You can't let someone pauperize you!\'94 A harsh smile twisted the Duke's mouth. \'93
They'd look the other way no matter what was done to me.\'94 
\par \'93Even if we were attacked with atomics?\'94
\par \'93Nothing that flagrant. No open defiance of the Convention. But almost anything else short of that\'85 perhaps even dusting and a bit of soil poisoning.\'94 
\par \'93Then why are we walking into this?\'94
\par \'93Paul!\'94 The Duke frowned at his son. \'93Knowing where the trap is \endash  that's the first step in evading it. This is like single combat, Son, only on a larger scale \endash  a feint within a feint within a feint\'85
 seemingly without end. The task is to unravel it. Knowing that the Harkonnens stockpile melange, we ask another question: Who else is stockpiling? That's the list of our enemies.\'94 
\par \'93Who?\'94
\par \'93Certain Houses we knew were unfriendly and some we'd thought friendly. We need not consider them for the moment because there is one other much more important: our beloved Padishah Emperor.\'94
\par Paul tried to swallow in a throat suddenly dry. \'93Couldn't you convene the Landsraad, expose \endash \'94
\par \'93Make our enemy aware we know which hand holds the knife? Ah, now, Paul \endash  we see the knife, now. Who knows where it mi
ght be shifted next? If we put this before the Landsraad it'd only create a great cloud of confusion. The Emperor would deny it. Who could gainsay him? All we'd gain is a little time while risking chaos. And where would the next attack come from?\'94 

\par \'93All the Houses might start stockpiling spice.\'94 
\par \'93Our enemies have a head start \endash  too much of a lead to overcome.\'94 
\par \'93The Emperor,\'94 Paul said. \'93That means the Sardaukar.\'94 
\par \'93Disguised in Harkonnen livery, no doubt,\'94 the Duke said. \'93But the soldier fanatics nonetheless.\'94 
\par \'93How can Fremen help us against Sardaukar?\'94 
\par \'93Did Hawat talk to you about Salusa Secundus?\'94 
\par \'93The Emperor's prison planet? No.\'94
\par \'93What if it were more than a prison planet, Paul? There's a question you never hear asked about the Imperial Corps of Sardaukar: Where do they come from?\'94 
\par \'93From the prison planet?\'94 
\par \'93They come from somewhere.\'94 
\par \'93But the supporting levies the Emperor demands from \endash \'94 
\par \'93That's what we're led to believe: they're just the Emperor's levies trained young and superbly. You hear an 
occasional muttering about the Emperor's training cadres, but the balance of our civilization remains the same: the military forces of the Landsraad Great Houses on one side, the Sardaukar and their supporting levies on the other. And their supporting lev
ies, Paul. The Sardaukar remain the Sardaukar.\'94 
\par \'93But every report on Salusa Secundus says S.S. is a hell world!\'94 
\par \'93Undoubtedly. But if you were going to raise tough, strong, ferocious men, what environmental conditions would you impose on them?\'94
\par \'93How could you win the loyalty of such men?\'94 
\par \'93There are proven ways: play on the certain knowledge of their superiority, the mystique of secret covenant, the esprit of shared suffering. It can be done. It has been done on many worlds in many times.\'94
\par Paul nodded, holding his attention on his father's face. He felt some revelation impending.
\par \'93Consider Arrakis,\'94 the Duke said. \'93When you get outside the towns and garrison villages, it's every bit as terrible a place as Salusa Secundus.\'94 
\par Paul's eyes went wide. \'93The Fremen!\'94
\par \'93We have there the potential of a corps as strong and deadly as the Sardaukar. It'll require patience to exploit them secretly and wealth to equip them properly. But the Fremen are there\'85
 and the spice wealth is there. You see now why we walk into Arrakis, knowing the trap is there.\'94 
\par \'93Don't the Harkonnens know about the Fremen?\'94 
\par \'93The Harkonnens sneered at the Fremen, hunted them for sport, never even bothered trying to count them. We know the Harkonnen policy with planetary populations \endash  spend as little as possible to maintain them.\'94
\par The metallic threads in the hawk symbol above his father's breast glistened as the Duke shifted his position. \'93You see?\'94 
\par \'93We're negotiating with the Fremen right now,\'94 Paul said.
\par \'93I sent a mission headed by Duncan Idaho,\'94 the Duke said. \'93A proud and ruthless man, Duncan, but fond of the truth. I think the Fremen will admire him. If we're lucky, they may judge us by him: Duncan, the moral.\'94 
\par \'93Duncan, the moral,\'94 Paul said, \'93and Gurney the valorous.\'94 
\par \'93You name them well,\'94 the Duke said.
\par And Paul thought: Gurney's one of those the Reverend Mother meant, a supporter of worlds \endash  \'93\'85 the valor of the brave.\'94 
\par \'93Gurney tells me you did well in weapons today,\'94 the Duke said.
\par \'93That isn't what he told me.\'94
\par The Duke laughed aloud. \'93I figured Gurney to be sparse with his praise. He says you have a nicety of awareness \endash  in his own words \endash  of the difference between a blade's edge and its tip.\'94 
\par \'93Gurney says there's no artistry in killing with the tip, that it should be done with the edge.\'94
\par \'93Gurney's a romantic,\'94 the Duke growled. This talk of killing suddenly disturbed him, coming from his son. \'93I'd sooner you never had to kill\'85 but if the need arises, you do it however you can \endash  tip or edge.\'94
 He looked up at the skylight, on which the rain was drumming.
\par Seeing the direction of his father's stare, Paul thought of the wet skies out there \endash  a thing never to be seen on Arrakis from all accounts \endash  and this thought of skies put him in mind of the space beyond. \'93Are the Guild ships really big?
\'94 he asked.
\par The Duke looked at him. \'93This will be your first time off planet,\'94 he said. \'93
Yes, they're big. We'll be riding a Heighliner because it's a long trip. A Heighliner is truly big. Its hold will tuck all our frigates and transports into a little corner \endash  we'll be just a small part of the ship's manifest.\'94 
\par \'93And we won't be able to leave our frigates?\'94 
\par \'93That's part of the price you pay for Guild Security. There could be Harkonnen ships right alongside us and we'd have nothing to fear from them. The Harkonnens know better than to endanger their shipping privileges.\'94 
\par \'93I'm going to watch our screens and try to see a Guildsman.\'94 
\par \'93You won't. Not even their agents ever see a Guildsman. The Guild's as jealous of its privacy as it is of its monopoly. Don't do anything to endanger our shipping privileges, Paul.\'94 
\par \'93Do you think they hide because they've mutated and don't look\'85 human anymore?\'94
\par \'93Who knows?\'94 The Duke shrugged. \'93It's a mystery we're not likely to solve. We've more immediate problems \endash  among them: you.\'94 
\par \'93Me?\'94
\par \'93Your mother wanted me to be the one to tell you, Son. You see, you may have Mentat capabilities.\'94
\par Paul stared at his father, unable to speak for a moment, then: \'93A Mentat? Me? But I\'85 \'94 
\par \'93Hawat agrees, Son. It's true.\'94
\par \'93But I thought Mentat training had to start during infancy and the subject couldn't be told because it might inhibit the early\'85 \'94 He broke off, all his past circumstances coming to focus in one flashing computation. \'93I see,\'94 he said.
\par \'93A day comes,\'94 the Duke said, \'93when the potentia
l Mentat must learn what's being done. It may no longer be done to him. The Mentat has to share in the choice of whether to continue or abandon the training. Some can continue; some are incapable of it. Only the potential Mentat can tell this for sure abo
ut himself.\'94 
\par Paul rubbed his chin. All the special training from Hawat and his mother \endash  the mnemonics, the focusing of awareness, the muscle control and sharpening of sensitivities, the study of languages and nuances of voices \endash 
 all of it clicked into a new kind of understanding in his mind.
\par \'93You'll be the Duke someday, Son,\'94 his father said. \'93A Mentat Duke would be formidable indeed. Can you decide now\'85 or do you need more time?\'94
\par There was no hesitation in his answer. \'93I'll go on with the training.\'94
\par \'93Formidable indeed,\'94
 the Duke murmured, and Paul saw the proud smile on his father's face. The smile shocked Paul: it had a skull look on the Duke's narrow features. Paul closed his eyes, feeling the terrible purpose reawaken within him. Perhaps being a Mentat i
s terrible purpose, he thought.
\par But even as he focused on this thought, his new awareness denied it.
\par 
\par 
\par With the Lady Jessica and Arrakis, the Bene Gesserit system of sowing implant-legends through the Missionaria Protectiva came to its full fruition. The w
isdom of seeding the known universe with a prophecy pattern for the protection of B.G. personnel has long been appreciated, but never have we seen a condition-ut-extremis with more ideal mating of person and preparation. The prophetic legends had taken on
 Arrakis even to the extent of adopted labels (including Reverend Mother, canto and respondu, and most of the Shari-a panoplia propheticus). And it is generally accepted now that the Lady Jessica's latent abilities were grossly underestimated.
\par -from \'93Analysis: The Arrakeen Crisis\'94 by the Princess Irulan [Private circulation: B.G. file number AR-81088587]
\par 
\par All around the Lady Jessica \endash  piled in corners of the Arrakeen great hall, mounded in the open spaces \endash  stood the packaged freight of their lives: boxes, trunks, cartons, cases \endash 
 some partly unpacked. She could hear the cargo handlers from the Guild shuttle depositing another load in the entry.
\par Jessica stood in the center of the hall. She moved in a slow turn, looking up and around at shadowed carvings, crannies and deeply recessed windows. This giant anachronism of a room reminded her of the Sisters\rquote 
 Hall at her Bene Gesserit school. But at the school the effect had been of warmth. Here, all was bleak stone.
\par Some architect had reached far back into history f
or these buttressed walls and dark hangings, she thought. The arched ceiling stood two stories above her with great crossbeams she felt sure had been shipped here to Arrakis across space at monstrous cost. No planet of this system grew trees to make such 
beams \endash  unless the beams were imitation wood. 
\par She thought not.
\par This had been the government mansion in the days of the Old Empire. Costs had been of less importance then. It had been before the Harkonnens and their new megalopolis of Carthag \endash  a cheap and 
brassy place some two hundred kilometers northeast across the Broken Land. Leto had been wise to choose this place for his seat of government. The name, Arrakeen, had a good sound, filled with tradition. And this was a smaller city, easier to sterilize an
d defend.
\par Again there came the clatter of boxes being unloaded in the entry. Jessica sighed.
\par Against a carton to her right stood the painting of the Duke's father. Wrapping twine hung from it like a frayed decoration. A piece of the twine was still clutched
 in Jessica's left hand. Beside the painting lay a black bull's head mounted on a polished board. The head was a dark island in a sea of wadded paper. Its plaque lay flat on the floor, and the bull's shiny muzzle pointed at the ceiling as though the beast
 were ready to bellow a challenge into this echoing room.
\par Jessica wondered what compulsion had brought her to uncover those two things first \endash  the head and the painting. She knew there was something symbolic in the action. Not since the day when the Duke's 
buyers had taken her from the school had she felt this frightened and unsure of herself. 
\par The head and the picture.
\par They heightened her feelings of confusion. She shuddered, glanced at the slit windows high overhead. It was still early afternoon here, and in these latitudes the sky looked black and cold \endash 
 so much darker than the warm blue of Caladan. A pang of homesickness throbbed through her. 
\par So far away, Caladan. 
\par \'93Here we are!\'94
\par The voice was Duke Leto's.
\par She whirled, saw him striding from the arched passage to the dining hall. His black working uniform with red armorial hawk crest at the breast looked dusty and rumpled.
\par \'93I thought you might have lost yourself in this hideous place,\'94 he said.
\par \'93It is a cold house,\'94 she said. She looked at his tallness, at
 the dark skin that made her think of olive groves and golden sun on blue waters. There was woodsmoke in the gray of his eyes, but the face was predatory: thin, full of sharp angles and planes.
\par A sudden fear of him tightened her breast. He had become such a savage, driving person since the decision to bow to the Emperor's command.
\par \'93The whole city feels cold,\'94 she said.
\par \'93It's a dirty, dusty little garrison town,\'94 he agreed. \'93But we'll change that.\'94 He looked around the hall. \'93These are public rooms for stat
e occasions. I've just glanced at some of the family apartments in the south wing. They're much nicer.\'94 He stepped closer, touched her arm, admiring her stateliness.
\par And again, he wondered at her unknown ancestry \endash  a renegade House, perhaps? Some black-barred royalty? She looked more regal than the Emperor's own blood.
\par Under the pressure of his stare, she turned half away, exposing her profile. And he realized there was no single and precise thing that brought her beauty to focus. The face was oval under a 
cap of hair the color of polished bronze. Her eyes were set wide, as green and clear as the morning skies of Caladan. The nose was small, the mouth wide and generous. Her figure was good but scant: tall and with its curves gone to slimness.
\par He remembered that the lay sisters at the school had called her skinny, so his buyers had told him. But that description oversimplified. She had brought a regal beauty back into the Atreides line. He was glad that Paul favored her. 
\par \'93Where's Paul?\'94 he asked.
\par \'93Someplace around the house taking his lessons with Yueh.\'94 
\par \'93Probably in the south wing,\'94 he said. \'93I thought I heard Yueh's voice, but I couldn't take time to look.\'94 He glanced down at her, hesitating. \'93I came here only to hang the key of Caladan Castle in the dining hall.\'94
\par She caught her breath, stopped the impulse to reach out to him. Hanging the key \endash  there was finality in that action. But this was not the time or place for comforting. \'93I saw our banner over the house as we came in,\'94 she said.
\par He glanced at the painting of his father. \'93Where were you going to hang that?\'94 
\par \'93Somewhere in here.\'94
\par \'93No.\'94 The word rang flat and final, telling her she could use trickery to persuade, but open argument was useless. Still, she had to try, even if the gesture served only to remind herself that she would not trick him.
\par \'93My Lord,\'94 she said, \'93if you'd only\'85 \'94
\par \'93The answer remains no. I indulge you shamefully in most things, not in this. I've just come from the dining hall where there are \endash \'94 
\par \'93My Lord! Please.\'94
\par \'93The choice is between your digestion and my ancestral dignity, my dear,\'94 he said. \'93They will hang in the dining hall.\'94 
\par She sighed. \'93Yes, my Lord.\'94
\par \'93You may resume your custom of dining in your rooms whenever possible. I shall expect you at your proper position only on formal occasions.\'94 
\par \'93Thank you, my Lord.\'94
\par \'93And don't go all cold and formal on me! Be thankful that I never married you, my dear. Then it'd be your duty to join me at table for every meal.\'94 
\par She held her face immobile, nodded.
\par \'93Hawat already has our own poison snooper over the dining table,\'94 he said. \'93There's a portable in your room.\'94 
\par \'93You anticipated this\'85 disagreement,\'94 she said.
\par \'93My dear, I think also of your comfort. I've engaged servants. They're locals, but Hawat has cleared them \endash  they're Fremen all. They'll do until our own people can be released from their other duties.\'94 
\par \'93Can anyone from this place be truly safe?\'94
\par \'93Anyone who hates Harkonnens. You may even want to keep the head housekeeper: the Shadout Mapes.\'94 
\par \'93Shadout,\'94 Jessica said. \'93A Fremen title?\'94
\par \'93I'm told it means \lquote well-dipper,\rquote  a meaning with rather important overtones here. She may not strike you as a servant type, although Hawat speaks highly of her on the basis of Duncan's report. They're convinced she wants to serve \endash 
 specifically that she wants to serve you.\'94 
\par \'93Me?\'94
\par \'93The Fremen have learned that you're Bene Gesserit,\'94 he said. \'93There are legends here about the Bene Gesserit.\'94
\par The Missionaria Protectiva, Jessica thought. No place escapes them.
\par \'93Does this mean Duncan was successful?\'94 she asked. \'93Will the Fremen be our allies?\'94
\par \'93There's nothing definite,\'94 he said. \'93They wish to observe us for a while, Duncan believes. They did, however, promise to stop raiding our outlying villages during a truce period. That's a more important gain than it might
 seem. Hawat tells me the Fremen were a deep thorn in the Harkonnen side, that the extent of their ravages was a carefully guarded secret. It wouldn't have helped for the Emperor to learn the ineffectiveness of the Harkonnen military.\'94 
\par \'93A Fremen housekeeper,\'94 Jessica mused, returning to the subject of the Shadout Mapes. \'93She'll have the all-blue eyes.\'94 
\par \'93Don't let the appearance of these people deceive you,\'94 he said. \'93There's a deep strength and healthy vitality in them. I think they'll be everything we need.\'94 
\par \'93It's a dangerous gamble,\'94 she said. 
\par \'93Let's not go into that again,\'94 he said.
\par She forced a smile. \'93We are committed, no doubt of that.\'94 She went through the quick regimen of calmness \endash  the two deep breaths, the ritual thought, then: \'93When I assign rooms, is there anything special I should reserve for you?\'94
\par \'93You must teach me someday how you do that,\'94 he said, \'93the way you thrust your worries aside and turn to practical matters. It must be a Bene Gesserit thing.\'94 
\par \'93It's a female thing,\'94 she said.
\par He smiled. \'93
Well, assignment of rooms: make certain, I have large office space next my sleeping quarters. There'll be more paper work here than on Caladan. A guard room, of course. That should cover it. Don't worry about security of the house. Hawat's men have
 been over it in depth.\'94 
\par \'93I'm sure they have.\'94
\par He glanced at his wristwatch. \'93And you might see that all our timepieces are adjusted for Arrakeen local. I've assigned a tech to take care of it. He'll be along presently.\'94 He brushed a strand of her hair back from her forehead. \'93
I must return to the landing field now. The second shuttle's due any minute with my staff reserves.\'94 
\par \'93Couldn't Hawat meet them, my Lord? You look so tired.\'94 
\par \'93The good Thufir is even busier than I am. You know this planet's infested with Harkonnen intrigues. Besides, I must try persuading some of the trained spice hunters against leaving. They have the option, you know, with the change of fief \endash 
 and this planetologist the Emperor and the Landsraad installed as Judge of the Change cannot be bought. He's allowing the opt. About eight hundred trained hands expect to go out on the spice shuttle and there's a Guild cargo ship standing by.\'94 
\par \'93My Lord\'85 \'94 She broke off, hesitating. 
\par \'93Yes?\'94
\par He will not be persuaded against trying to make this planet secure for us, she thought. And I cannot use my tricks on him. 
\par \'93At what time will you be expecting dinner?\'94 she asked.
\par That's not what she was going to say, he thought. Ah-h-h-h, my Jessica, would that we were somewhere else, anywhere away from this terrible place \endash  alone, the two of us, without a care.
\par \'93I'll eat in the officers\rquote  mess at the field,\'94 he said. \'93Don't expect me until very late. And\'85ah, I'll be sending a guardcar for Paul. I want him to attend our strategy conference.\'94 
\par He cleared his t
hroat as though to say something else, then, without warning, turned and strode out, headed for the entry where she could hear more boxes being deposited. His voice sounded once from there, commanding and disdainful, the way he always spoke to servants wh
en he was in a hurry: \'93The Lady Jessica's in the Great Hall. Join her there immediately.\'94 
\par The outer door slammed.
\par Jessica turned away, faced the painting of Leto's father. It had been done by the famed artist, Albe, during the Old Duke's middle years. He w
as portrayed in matador costume with a magenta cape flung over his left arm. The face looked young, hardly older than Leto's now, and with the same hawk features, the same gray stare. She clenched her fists at her sides, glared at the painting. 
\par \'93Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!\'94 she whispered. 
\par \'93What are your orders, Noble Born?\'94 
\par It was a woman's voice, thin and stringy.
\par Jessica whirled, stared down at a knobby, gray-haired woman in a shapeless sack dress of bondsman brown. The woman looked as wrinkled and d
esiccated as any member of the mob that had greeted them along the way from the landing field that morning. Every native she had seen on this planet, Jessica thought, looked prune dry and undernourished. Yet, Leto had said they were strong and vital. And 
there were the eyes, of course \endash  that wash of deepest, darkest blue without any white \endash  secretive, mysterious. Jessica forced herself not to stare.
\par The woman gave a stiff-necked nod, said: \'93I am called the Shadout Mapes, Noble Born. What are your orders?\'94
\par \'93You may refer to me as \lquote my Lady,\rquote  \'93 Jessica said. \'93I'm not noble born. I'm the bound concubine of the Duke Leto.\'94 
\par Again that strange nod, and the woman peered upward at Jessica with a sly questioning, \'93There's a wife, then?\'94
\par \'93There is not, nor has there ever been. I am the Duke's only\'85 companion, the mother of his heir-designate.\'94
\par Even as she spoke, Jessica laughed inwardly at the pride behind her words. What was it St. Augustine said? she asked herself. \'93The mind commands the body and it obeys. The mind orders itself and meets resistance.\'94 Yes \endash 
 I am meeting more resistance lately. I could use a quiet retreat by myself.
\par A weird cry sounded from the road outside the house. It was repeated: \'93Soo-soo-Sook! Soo-soo-Sook!\'94 Then: \'93Ikhut-eigh! Ikhut-eigh!\'94 And again: \'93Soo-soo-Sook!\'94
\par \'93What is that?\'94 Jessica asked. \'93I heard it several times as we drove through the streets this morning.\'94
\par \'93Only a water-seller, my Lady. But you've no need to interest yourself in such as they. The cistern here holds fifty thousand liters and it's always kept full.\'94 She glanced down at her dress. \'93
Why, you know, my Lady, I don't even have to wear my stillsuit here?\'94 She cackled. \'93And me not even dead!\'94
\par Jessica hesitated, wanting to question this Fremen woman, needing data to guide her. But bringing order of the confusion in the castle was more imperative. Still, she found the thought unsettling that water was a major mark of wealth here.
\par \'93My husband told me of your title, Shadout,\'94 Jessica said. \'93I recognized the word. It's a very ancient word.\'94
\par \'93You know the ancient tongues then?\'94 Mapes asked, and she waited with an odd intensity.
\par \'93Tongues are the Bene Gesserit's first learning,\'94 Jessica said. \'93I know the Bhotani Jib and the Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.\'94 
\par Mapes nodded. \'93Just as the legend says.\'94
\par And Jessica wondered: Why do I play out this sham? But the Bene Gesserit ways were devious and compelling.
\par \'93I know the Dark Things and the ways of the Great Mother,\'94 Jessica said. She read the more obvious signs in Mapes\rquote  actions and appearance, the petit betrayals. \'93Miseces prejia,\'94 she said in the Chakobsa tongue. \'93
Andral t're pera! Trada cik buscakri miseces perakri \endash \'94 
\par Mapes took a backward step, appeared poised to flee. 
\par \'93I know many things.\'94 Jessica said. \'93I know that you have borne children, that you have lost loved ones, that you have hidden in fear and that you have done violence and will yet do more violence. I know many things.\'94 
\par In a low voice, Mapes said: \'93I meant no offense, my Lady.\'94 
\par \'93You speak of the legend and seek answers,\'94 Jessica said. \'93Beware the answers you may find. I know you came prepared for violence with a weapon in your bodice.\'94 
\par \'93My Lady, I\'85 \'94
\par \'93There's a remote possibility you could draw my life's blood,\'94 Jessica said, \'93but in so doing you'd bring down more ruin than your wildest fears could imagine. There are worse things than dying, you know \endash  even for an entire people.\'94

\par \'93My Lady!\'94 Mapes pleaded. She appeared about to fall to her knees. \'93The weapon was sent as a gift to you should you prove to be the One.\'94
\par \'93And as the means of my death should I prove otherwise,\'94 Jessica said. She waited in the seeming relaxation that made the Bene Gesserit-trained so terrifying in combat. 
\par Now we see which way the decision tips, she thought.
\par Slowly, Mapes reached into the neck of h
er dress, brought out a dark sheath. A black handle with deep finger ridges protruded from it. She took sheath in one hand and handle in the other, withdrew a milk-white blade, held it up. The blade seemed to shine and glitter with a light of its own. It 
was double-edged like a kindjal and the blade was perhaps twenty centimeters long. 
\par \'93Do you know this, my Lady?\'94 Mapes asked.
\par It could only be one thing, Jessica knew, the fabled crysknife of Arrakis, the blade that had never been taken off the planet, and was known only by rumor and wild gossip. 
\par \'93It's a crysknife,\'94 she said.
\par \'93Say it not lightly,\'94 Mapes said. \'93Do you know its meaning?\'94 
\par And Jessica thought: There was an edge to that question. Here's the reason this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. My answer could precipitate violence or\'85
 what? She seeks an answer from me: the meaning of a knife. She's called the Shadow in the Chakobsa tongue. Knife, that's \'93Death Maker\'94 in Chakobsa. She's getting restive. I must answer now. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. 
\par Jessica said: \'93It's a maker \endash \'94
\par \'93}{\fs28\lang1031\langfe1033\langnp1031\insrsid1513027\charrsid13785764 Eighe-e-e-e-e-e!\'94 }{\fs28\insrsid1513027\charrsid13785764 
Mapes wailed. It was a sound of both grief and elation. She trembled so hard the knife blade sent glittering shards of reflection shooting around the room.
\par Jessica waited, poised. She had intended to say the knife was a maker of death and then add the ancient word, but every sense warned her now, all the deep training of alertness that exposed meaning in the most casual muscle twitch. 
\par The key word was\'85 maker.
\par Maker? Maker.
\par Still, Mapes held the knife as though ready to use it.
\par Jessica said: \'93Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the Maker?\'94
\par Mapes lowered the knife. \'93My Lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.\'94 
\par Jessica thought about the prophecy \endash  the Shari-a and all the panoplia propheticus, a Bene Gesserit of the Missionaria Protectiva dropped here long centuries ago \endash  long dead, no doubt, but her purpose accomplished: the protectiv
e legends implanted in these people against the day of a Bene Gesserit's need. 
\par Well, that day had come.
\par Mapes returned knife to sheath, said: \'93This is an unfixed blade, my Lady. Keep it near you. More than a week away from flesh and it begins to disintegrate. It's yours, a tooth of shai-hulud, for as long as you live.\'94
\par Jessica reached out her right hand, risked a gamble: \'93Mapes, you've sheathed that blade unblooded.\'94
\par With a gasp, Mapes dropped the sheathed knife into Jessica's hand, tore open the brown bodice, wailing: \'93Take the water of my life!\'94
\par Jessica withdrew the blade from its sheath. How it glittered! She directed the point toward Mapes, saw a fear greater than death-panic come over the woman. Poison in the point? Jessica wondered. She tipped up the 
point, drew a delicate scratch with the blade's edge above Mapes\rquote  left breast. There was a thick welling of blood that stopped almost immediately. Ultrafast coagulation, Jessica thought. A moisture-conserving mutation?
\par She sheathed the blade, said: \'93Button your dress, Mapes.\'94 
\par Mapes obeyed, trembling. The eyes without whites stared at Jessica. \'93You are ours,\'94 she muttered. \'93You are the One.\'94 
\par There came another sound of unloading in the entry. Swiftly, Mapes grabbed the sheathed knife, concealed it in Jessica's bodice. \'93Who sees that knife must be cleansed or slain!\'94 she snarled. \'93You know that, my Lady!\'94 
\par I know it now, Jessica thought.
\par The cargo handlers left without intruding on the Great Hall.
\par Mapes composed herself, said: \'93The uncleansed who have seen a crysknife may not leave Arrakis alive. Never forget that, my Lady. You've been entrusted with a crysknife.\'94 She took a deep breath. \'93
Now the thing must take its course. It cannot be hurried.\'94 She glanced at the stacked boxes and piled goods around them. \'93And there's work aplenty to while the time for us here.\'94 
\par Jessica hesitated. \'93The thing must take its course.\'94 That was a specific catchphrase from the Missionaria Protectiva's stock of incantations \endash  The coming of the Reverend Mother to free you.
\par But I'm not a Reverend Mother, Jessica thought. And then: Great Mother! They planted that one here! This must be a hideous place!
\par In matter-of-fact tones, Mapes said: \'93What'll you be wanting me to do first, my Lady?\'94
\par Instinct warned Jessica to match that casual tone. She said: \'93The painting of the Old Duke over there, it must be hung on one side of the dining hall. The bull's head must go on the wall opposite the painting.\'94
\par Mapes crossed to the bull's head. \'93What a great beast it must have been to carry such a head,\'94 she said. She stooped. \'93I'll have to be cleaning this first, won't I, my Lady?\'94 
\par \'93No.\'94 
\par \'93But there's dirt caked on its horns.\'94
\par \'93That's not dirt, Mapes. That's the blood of our Duke's father. Those horns were sprayed with a transparent fixative within hours after this beast killed the Old Duke.\'94 
\par Mapes stood up. \'93Ah, now!\'94 she said.
\par \'93It's just blood,\'94 Jessica said. \'93Old blood at that. Get some help hanging these now. The beastly things are heavy.\'94
\par \'93Did you think the blood bothered me?\'94 Mapes asked. \'93I'm of the desert and I've seen blood aplenty.\'94 
\par \'93I\'85 see that you have,\'94 Jessica said.
\par \'93And some of it my own,\'94 Mapes said. \'93More'n you drew with your puny scratch.\'94 
\par \'93You'd rather I'd cut deeper?\'94
\par \'93Ah, no! The body's water is scant enough \lquote thout gushing a wasteful lot of it into the air. You did the thing right.\'94 
\par And Jessica, noting the words and manner, caught the deeper implications in the phrase, \lquote the body's water.\rquote  Again she felt a sense of oppression at the importance of water on Arrakis.
\par \'93On which side of the dining hall shall I hang which one of these pretties, my Lady?\'94 Mapes asked.
\par Ever the practical one, this Mapes, Jessica thought. She said: \'93Use your own judgment, Mapes. It makes no real difference.\'94 
\par \'93As you say, my Lady.\'94 Mapes stooped, began clearing wrappings and twine from the head. \'93Killed an old duke, did you?\'94 she crooned.
\par \'93Shall I summon a handler to help you?\'94 Jessica asked. 
\par \'93I'll manage, my Lady.\'94
\par Yes, she'll manage, Jessica thought. There's that about this Fremen creature: the drive to manage.
\par Jessica felt the cold sheath of the crysknife beneath her bodice, thought of the long chain of Bene Gesserit scheming that had forged another link here. Because of that scheming, she had survived a deadly crisis. \'93It cannot be hurried,\'94 Mapes had sa
id. Yet there was a tempo of headlong rushing to this place that filled Jessica with foreboding. And not all the preparations of the Missionaria Protectiva nor Hawat's suspicious inspection of this castellated pile of rocks could dispel the feeling.

\par \'93When you've finished hanging those, start unpacking the boxes,\'94 Jessica said. \'93
One of the cargo men at the entry has all the keys and knows where things should go. Get the keys and the list from him. If there are any questions I'll be in the south wing.\'94 
\par \'93As you will, my Lady,\'94 Mapes said.
\par Jessica turned away, thinking: Hawat may have passed this residency as safe, but there's something wrong about the place. I can feel it.
\par An urgent need to see her son gripped Jessica. She began walking toward the arched doorway that led into the passage to the dining hall and the family wings. Faster and faster she walked until she was almost running.
\par Behind her, Mapes paused in clearing the wrappings from the bull's head, looked at the retreating back. \'93She's the One all right,\'94 she muttered. \'93Poor thing.\'94
\par 
\par 
\par \'93Yueh! Yueh! Yueh!\'94 goes the refrain. \'93A million deaths were not enough for Yueh!\'94
\par -from \'93A Child's History of Muad'Dib\'94 by the Princess Irulan
\par 
\par The door stood ajar, and Jessica stepped through it into a room with yellow w
alls. To her left stretched a low settee of black hide and two empty bookcases, a hanging waterflask with dust on its bulging sides. To her right, bracketing another door, stood more empty bookcases, a desk from Caladan and three chairs. At the windows di
rectly ahead of her stood Dr. Yueh, his back to her, his attention fixed upon the outside world. 
\par Jessica took another silent step into the room.
\par She saw that Yueh's coat was wrinkled, a white smudge near the left elbow as though he had leaned against chalk
. He looked, from behind, like a fleshless stick figure in overlarge black clothing, a caricature poised for stringy movement at the direction of a puppet master. Only the squarish block of head with long ebony hair caught in its silver Suk School ring at
 the shoulder seemed alive\endash turning slightly to follow some movement outside.
\par Again, she glanced around the room, seeing no sign of her son, but the closed door on her right, she knew, let into a small bedroom for which Paul had expressed a liking.
\par \'93Good afternoon. Dr. Yueh,\'94 she said. \'93Where's Paul?\'94 
\par He nodded as though to something out the window, spoke in an absent manner without turning: \'93Your son grew tired, Jessica. I sent him into the next room to rest.\'94
\par Abruptly, he stiffened, whirled with mustache flopping over his purpled lips. \'93Forgive me, my Lady! My thoughts were far away\'85 I\'85 did not mean to be familiar.\'94
\par She smiled, held out her right hand. For a moment, she was afraid he might kneel. \'93Wellington, please.\'94 
\par \'93To use your name like that\'85 I\'85 \'94
\par \'93We've known each other six years,\'94 she said. \'93It's long past time formalities should've been dropped between us\endash in private.\'94 
\par Yueh ventured a thin smile, thinking: I believe it has worked. Now, she'll think anything unusual in my manner is due to embarrassment. She'll not look for deeper reasons when she believes she already knows the answer.
\par \'93I'm afraid I was woolgathering,\'94 he said. \'93Whenever I\'85 feel especially sorry for you. I'm afraid I think of you as\'85 well, Jessica.\'94 
\par \'93Sorry for me? Whatever for?\'94
\par Yueh shrugged. Long ago, he had realized Jessica was not gifted with the full Truthsay as his Wanna had been. Still, he always used the truth with Jessica whenever possible. It was safest.
\par \'93You've seen this place, my\'85 Jessica.\'94 He stumbled over the name, plunged ahead: \'93So barren after Caladan. And the people! Those townswomen we passed on the way here wailing beneath their veils. The way they looked at us.\'94
\par She folded her arms across her breast, hugging herself, feeling the crysknife there, a blade ground from a sandworm's tooth, if the reports were right. \'93It's just that we're strange to them\endash 
different people, different customs. They've known only the Harkonnens.\'94 She looked past him out the windows. \'93What were you staring at out there?\'94 
\par He turned back to the window. \'93The people.\'94 
\par Jessica crossed to his side, looked to the left toward the front of the house where Yueh's attention was focused. A line of twenty palm trees grew there, the ground beneath them swept clean, barren. A screen fence separated them from 
the road upon which robed people were passing. Jessica detected a faint shimmering in the air between her and the people\endash a house shield\endash and went on to study the passing throng, wondering why Yueh found them so absorbing.
\par The pattern emerged and she put a hand to her cheek. The way the passing people looked at the palm trees! She saw envy, some hate\'85 even a sense of hope. Each person raked those trees with a fixity of expression.
\par \'93Do you know what they're thinking?\'94 Yueh asked. 
\par \'93You profess to read minds?\'94 she asked.
\par \'93Those minds,\'94 he said. \'93They look at those trees and they think; \lquote There are one hundred of us.\rquote  That's what they think.\'94 
\par She turned a puzzled frown on him. \'93Why?\'94
\par \'93Those are date palms,\'94 he said. \'93One date palm requires forty liters of water a day. A man requires but eight liters. A palm, then, equals five men. There are twenty palms out there\endash one hundred men.\'94 
\par \'93But some of those people look at the trees hopefully.\'94 
\par \'93They but hope some dates will fall, except it's the wrong season.\'94
\par \'93We look at this place with too critical an eye,\'94 she said. \'93There's hope as well as danger here. The spice could make us rich. With a fat treasury, we can make this world into whatever we wish.\'94
\par And she laughed silently at herself: Who am I trying to convince? The laugh broke through her restraints, emerging brittle, without humor. \'93But you can't buy security,\'94 she said.
\par Yueh turned away to hide his face from her. If only it were possible to hate these people instead of love them! In her manner, in many ways, Jessi
ca was like his Wanna. Yet that thought carried its own rigors, hardening him to his purpose. The ways of the Harkonnen cruelty were devious. Wanna might not be dead. He had to be certain.
\par \'93Do not worry for us, Wellington,\'94 Jessica said. \'93The problem's ours, not yours.\'94
\par She thinks I worry for her! He blinked back tears. And I do, of course. But I must stand before that black Baron with his deed accomplished, and take my one chance to strike him where he is weakest\endash in his gloating moment! 
\par He sighed.
\par \'93Would it disturb Paul if I looked in on him?\'94 she asked. 
\par \'93Not at all. I gave him a sedative.\'94 
\par \'93He's taking the change well?\'94 she asked.
\par \'93Except for getting a bit overtired. He's excited, but what fifteen-year-old wouldn't be under these circumstances?\'94 He crossed to the door, opened it. \'93He's in here.\'94 
\par Jessica followed, peered into a shadowy room.
\par Paul lay on a narrow cot, one arm beneath a light cover, the other thrown back over his head. Slatted blinds at a window beside the bed wove a loom of shadows across face and blanket.
\par Jessica stared at her son, seeing the oval shape of face so like her own. But the hair was the Duke's\endash coal-colored and tousled. Long lashes concealed the lime-toned eyes. Jessica smiled, feeling her fears retreat. She was suddenly caught
 by the idea of genetic traces in her son's features\endash her lines in eyes and facial outline, but sharp touches of the father peering through that outline like maturity emerging from childhood.
\par She thought of the boy's features as an exquisite distillation out of random patterns\endash 
endless queues of happenstance meeting at this nexus. The thought made her want to kneel beside the bed and take her son in her arms, but she was inhibited by Yueh's presence. She stepped back, closed the door softly.
\par Yueh had returned
 to the window, unable to bear watching the way Jessica stared at her son. Why did Wanna never give me children? he asked himself. I know as a doctor there was no physical reason against it. Was there some Bene Gesserit reason? Was she, perhaps, instructe
d to serve a different purpose? What could it have been? She loved me, certainly.
\par For the first time, he was caught up in the thought that he might be part of a pattern more involuted and complicated than his mind could grasp.
\par Jessica stopped beside him, said: \'93What delicious abandon in the sleep of a child.\'94 
\par He spoke mechanically: \'93If only adults could relax like that.\'94 
\par \'93Yes.\'94 
\par \'93Where do we lose it?\'94 he murmured.
\par She glanced at him, catching the odd tone, but her mind was still on Paul, thinking of the new rigors in his training here, thinking of the differences in his life now\endash so very different from the life they once had planned for him.
\par \'93We do, indeed, lose something,\'94 she said.
\par She glanced out to the right at a slope humped with a wind-troubled gray-green of bushes\endash dusty leaves and dry claw branches. The too-dark sky hung over the slope like a blot, and the milky light of the Arrakeen sun gave the scene a silver cast
\endash light like the crysknife concealed in her bodice. 
\par \'93The sky's so dark,\'94 she said.
\par \'93That's partly the lack of moisture,\'94 he said.
\par \'93Water!\'94 she snapped. \'93Everywhere you turn here, you're involved with the lack of water!\'94 
\par \'93It's the precious mystery of Arrakis,\'94 he said.
\par \'93Why is there so little of it? There's volcanic rock here. There're a dozen power sources I could name. There's polar ice. They say you can't drill in the desert\endash 
storms and sandtides destroy equipment faster than it can be installed, if the worms don't get you first. They've never found water traces there, anyway. But the myster
y, Wellington, the real mystery is the wells that've been drilled up here in the sinks and basins. Have you read about those?\'94 
\par \'93First a trickle, then nothing,\'94 he said.
\par \'93But, Wellington, that's the mystery. The water was there. It dries up. And never again is there water. Yet another hole nearby produces the same result: a trickle that stops. Has no one ever been curious about this?\'94
\par \'93It is curious,\'94 he said. \'93You suspect some living agency? Wouldn't that have shown in core samples?\'94
\par \'93What would have shown? Alien plant matter\'85 or animal? Who could recognize it?\'94 She turned back to the slope. \'93The water is stopped. Something plugs it. That's my suspicion.\'94 
\par \'93Perhaps the reason's known,\'94 he said. \'93The Harkonnens sealed off many sources of information about Arrakis. Perhaps there was reason to suppress this.\'94
\par \'93What reason?\'94 she asked. \'93And then there's the atmospheric moisture. Little enough of it, certainly, but there's some. It's the major source of water here, caught in windtraps and precipitators. Where does that come from?\'94 
\par \'93The polar caps?\'94
\par \'93Cold air takes up little moisture, Wellington. There are things here behind the Harkonnen veil that bear close investigation, and not all of those things are directly involved with the spice.\'94
\par \'93We are indeed behind the Harkonnen veil,\'94 he said. \'93Perhaps we'll\'85 \'94 He broke off, noting the sudden intense way she was looking at him. \'93Is something wrong?\'94
\par \'93The way you say \lquote Harkonnen,\rquote  \'93 she said. \'93Even my Duke's voice doesn't carry that weight of venom when he uses the hated name. I didn't know you had personal reasons to hate them, Wellington.\'94
\par Great Mother! he thought. I've aroused her suspicions! Now I must use every trick my Wanna taught me. There's only one solution: tell the truth as far as I can.
\par He said: \'93You didn't know that my wife, my Wanna\'85 \'94 He shrugged, unable to speak past a sudden constriction in his throat. Then: \'93They\'85 \'94
 The words would not come out. He felt panic, closed his eyes tightly, experiencing the agony in his chest and little else until a hand touched his arm gently.
\par \'93Forgive me,\'94 Jessica said. \'93I did not mean to open an old wound.\'94 And she thought: Those animals! His wife was Bene Gesserit\endash the signs are all over him. And it's obvious the Harkonnens killed her. Here's another poor victim bound to th
e Atreides by a cherem of hate.
\par \'93I am sorry,\'94 he said. \'93I'm unable to talk about it.\'94 He opened his eyes, giving himself up to the internal awareness of grief. That, at least, was truth.
\par Jessica studied him, seeing the up-angled cheeks, the dark sequins of
 almond eyes, the butter complexion, and stringy mustache hanging like a curved frame around purpled lips and narrow chin. The creases of his cheeks and forehead, she saw, were as much lines of sorrow as of age. A deep affection for him came over her.

\par \'93Wellington, I'm sorry we brought you into this dangerous place,\'94 she said.
\par \'93I came willingly,\'94 he said. And that, too, was true.
\par \'93But this whole planet's a Harkonnen trap. You must know that.\'94
\par \'93It will take more than a trap to catch the Duke Leto,\'94 he said. And that, too, was true.
\par \'93Perhaps I should be more confident of him,\'94 she said. \'93He is a brilliant tactician.\'94 
\par \'93We've been uprooted,\'94 he said. \'93That's why we're uneasy.\'94 
\par \'93And how easy it is to kill the uprooted plant,\'94 she said. \'93Especially when you put it down in hostile soil.\'94 
\par \'93Are we certain the soil's hostile?\'94
\par \'93There were water riots when it was learned how many people the Duke was adding to the population,\'94 she said. \'93They stopped only when the people learned we were installing new windtraps and condensers to take care of the load.\'94
\par \'93There is only so much water to support human life here,\'94 he said. \'93The people know if more come to drink a limited amount of water, the price goes up and the very poor die. But the Duke has solved this. It doesn't follow
 that the riots mean permanent hostility toward him.\'94
\par \'93And guards,\'94 she said. \'93Guards everywhere. And shields. You see the blurring of them everywhere you look. We did not live this way on Caladan.\'94 
\par \'93Give this planet a chance,\'94 he said.
\par But Jessica continued to stare hard-eyed out the window. \'93I can smell death in this place,\'94 she said. \'93
Hawat sent advance agents in here by the battalion. Those guards outside are his men. The cargo handlers are his men. There've been unexplained withdrawals of large sums from the treasury. The amounts mean only one thing: bribes in high places.\'94
 She shook her head. \'93Where Thufir Hawat goes, death and deceit follow.\'94 
\par \'93You malign him.\'94
\par \'93Malign? I praise him. Death and deceit are our only hopes now. I just do not fool myself about Thufir's methods.\'94 
\par \'93You should\'85 keep busy,\'94 he said. \'93Give yourself no time for such morbid\endash \'94
\par \'93Busy! What is it that takes most of my time, Wellington? I am the Duke's secretary\endash so busy that each day I learn new things to fear\'85 things even he doesn't suspect I know.\'94 She compressed her lips, spoke thinly: \'93
Sometimes I wonder how much my Bene Gesserit business training figured in his choice of me.\'94 
\par \'93What do you mean?\'94 He found himself caught by the cynical tone, the bitterness that he had never seen her expose.
\par \'93Don't you think, Wellington,\'94 she asked, \'93that a secretary bound to one by love is so much safer?\'94 
\par \'93That is not a worthy thought, Jessica.\'94
\par The rebuke came naturally to his lips. There was no doubt how the Duke felt about his concubine. One had only to watch him as he followed her with his eyes.
\par She sighed. \'93You're right. It's not worthy.\'94
\par Again, she hugged herself, pressing the sheathed crysknife against her flesh and thinking of the unfinished business it represented.
\par \'93There'll be much bloodshed soon,\'94 she said. \'93The Harkonnens won't rest until they're dead or my Duke destroyed. The Baron cannot forget that Leto is a cousin of the royal blood\endash no matter what the distance\endash 
while the Harkonnen titles came out of the CHOAM pocketbook. But the poison in him, deep in his mind, is the knowledge that an Atreides had a Harkonnen banished for cowardice after, the Battle of Corrin.\'94
\par \'93The old feud,\'94 Yueh muttered. And for a moment he felt an acid touch of hate. The old feud had trapped him in its web, killed his Wanna or\endash worse\endash 
left her for Harkonnen tortures until her husband did their bidding. The old feud had trapped him and these people were part of that poisonous thing. The irony was that such deadliness should come to flower here on Arrakis, the one so
urce in the universe of melange, the prolonger of life, the giver of health.
\par \'93What are you thinking?\'94 she asked.
\par \'93I am thinking that the spice brings six hundred and twenty thousand Solaris the decagram on the open market right now. That is wealth to buy many things.\'94 
\par \'93Does greed touch even you, Wellington?\'94 
\par \'93Not greed.\'94 
\par \'93What then?\'94
\par He shrugged. \'93Futility.\'94 He glanced at her. \'93Can you remember your first taste of spice?\'94 
\par \'93It tasted like cinnamon.\'94
\par \'93But never twice the same,\'94 he said. \'93It's like life\endash it
 presents a different face each time you take it. Some hold that the spice produces a learned-flavor reaction. The body, learning a thing is good for it, interprets the flavor as pleasurable\endash 
slightly euphoric. And, like life, never to be truly synthesized.\'94
\par \'93I think it would've been wiser for us to go renegade, to take ourselves beyond the Imperial reach,\'94 she said.
\par He saw that she hadn't been listening to him, focused on her words, wondering: Yes\endash why didn't she make him do this? She could make him do virtually anything.
\par He spoke quickly because here was truth and a change of subject: \'93Would you think it bold of me\'85 Jessica, if I asked a personal question?\'94
\par She pressed against the window ledge in an unexplainable pang of disquiet. \'93Of course not. You're\'85 my friend.\'94 
\par \'93Why haven't you made the Duke marry you?\'94 
\par She whirled, head up, glaring. \'93Made him marry me? But\endash \'94 
\par \'93I should not have asked,\'94 he said.
\par \'93No.\'94 She shrugged. \'93There's good political reason\endash as long as my Duke remains unmarried some of the Great Houses can still hope for alliance. And\'85 \'94 She sighed. \'93\'85
 motivating people, forcing them to your will, gives you a cynical attitude toward humanity. It degrades everything it touches. If I made him do\'85 this, then it would not be his doing.\'94
\par \'93It's a thing my Wanna might have said,\'94 he murmured. And this, too, was truth. He put a hand to his mouth, swallowing convulsively. He had never been closer to speaking out, confessing his secret role.
\par Jessica spoke, shattering the moment. \'93Besides, Wellington, the Duke is really two men. One of them I love very much. He's charming, witty, considerate\'85 tender\endash everything a woman could desire. But the other man is\'85
 cold, callous, demanding, selfish\endash as harsh and cruel as a winter wind. That's the man shaped by the father.\'94 Her face contorted. \'93If only that old man had died when my Duke was born!\'94
\par In the silence that came between them, a breeze from a ventilator could be heard fingering the blinds.
\par Presently, she took a deep breath, said, \'93Leto's right\endash these rooms are nicer than the ones in the other sections of the house.\'94 She turned, sweeping the room with her gaze. \'93
If you'll excuse me, Wellington, I want another look through this wing before I assign quarters.\'94
\par He nodded. \'93Of course.\'94 And he thought: if only there were some way not to do this thing that I must do.
\par Jessica dropped her arms, crossed to the hall door and stood there a moment, hesitating, then let herself out. All the time we talked he was hiding something, holding something back, she thought. To save my feeling
s, no doubt. He's a good man. Again, she hesitated, almost turned back to confront Yueh and drag the hidden thing from him. But that would only shame him, frighten him to learn he's so easily read. I should place more trust in my friends.
\par 
\par 
\par Many have marke
d the speed with which Muad'Dib learned the necessities of Arrakis. The Bene Gesserit, of course, know the basis of this speed. For the others, we can say that Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson o
f all was the basic trust that he could learn. It is shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad'Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.
\par -from \'93The Humanity of Muad'Dib\'94 by the Princess Irulan
\par 
\par Paul lay on the bed feigning sleep. It had been easy to palm Dr. Yueh's sleeping tablet, to pretend to swallow it. Paul suppressed a laugh. Even his mother had believed him asleep. He had wanted to jump up and ask her permission to
 go exploring the house, but had realized she wouldn't approve. Things were too unsettled yet. No. This way was best.
\par If I slip out without asking I haven't disobeyed orders. And I will stay in the house where it's safe.
\par He heard his mother and Yueh talking in the other room. Their words were indistinct\endash something about the spice\'85 the Harkonnens. The conversation rose and fell.
\par Paul's attention went to the carved headboard of his bed\endash a false headboard attached to the wall and concealing the controls for this
 room's functions. A leaping fish had been shaped on the wood with thick brown waves beneath it. He knew if he pushed the fish's one visible eye that would turn on the room's suspensor lamps. One of the waves, when twisted, controlled ventilation. Another
 changed the temperature.
\par Quietly, Paul sat up in bed. A tall bookcase stood against the wall to his left. It could be swung aside to reveal a closet with drawers along one side. The handle on the door into the hall was patterned on an ornithopter thrust bar.
\par It was as though the room had been designed to entice him. 
\par The room and this planet.
\par He thought of the filmbook Yueh had shown him\endash "Arrakis: His Imperial Majesty's Desert Botanical Testing Station.\'94 It was an old filmbook from before discovery of the s
pice. Names flitted through Paul's mind, each with its picture imprinted by the book's mnemonic pulse: saguaro, burro bush, date palm, sand verbena, evening primrose, barrel cactus, incense bush, smoke tree, creosote bush\'85
 kit fox, desert hawk, kangaroo mouse\'85 
\par Names and pictures, names and pictures from man's terranic past\endash and many to be found now nowhere else in the universe except here on Arrakis.
\par So many new things to learn about\endash the spice. 
\par And the sandworms.
\par A door closed in the other room. Paul heard his mother's footsteps retreating down the hall. Dr. Yueh, he knew, would find something to read and remain in the other room. 
\par Now was the moment to go exploring.
\par Paul slipped out of the bed, headed for the bookcase door that opened into the closet. He s
topped at a sound behind him, turned. The carved headboard of the bed was folding down onto the spot where he had been sleeping. Paul froze, and immobility saved his life.
\par From behind the headboard slipped a tiny hunter-seeker no more than five centimeters long. Paul recognized it at once\endash 
a common assassination weapon that every child of royal blood learned about at an early age. It was a ravening sliver of metal guided by some near-by hand and eye. It could burrow into moving flesh and chew its way up nerv
e channels to the nearest vital organ. 
\par The seeker lifted, swung sideways across the room and back.
\par Through Paul's mind flashed the related knowledge, the hunter-seeker limitations: Its compressed suspensor field distorted the vision of its transmitter eye
. With nothing but the dim light of the room to reflect his target, the operator would be relying on motion\endash 
anything that moved. A shield could slow a hunter, give time to destroy it, but Paul had put aside his shield on the bed. Lasguns would knock them down, but lasguns were expensive and notoriously cranky of maintenance\endash 
and there was always the peril of explosive pyrotechnics if the laser beam intersected a hot shield. The Atreides relied on their body shields and their wits.
\par Now, Paul held himself in near catatonic immobility, knowing he had only his wits to meet this threat.
\par The hunter-seeker lifted another half meter. It rippled through the slatted light from the window blinds, back and forth, quartering the room.
\par I must try to grab it, he thought. The suspensor field will make it slippery on the bottom. I must grip tightly.
\par The thing dropped a half meter, quartered to the left, circled back around the bed. A faint humming could be heard from it.
\par Who is operating that thing? Paul wondered. It has to be someone near. I could shout for Yueh, but it would take him the instant the door opened.
\par The hall door behind Paul creaked. A rap sounded there. The door opened.
\par The hunter-seeker arrowed past his head toward the motion.
\par Paul's right hand shot out and dow
n, gripping the deadly thing. It hummed and twisted in his hand, but his muscles were locked on it in desperation. With a violent turn and thrust, he slammed the thing's nose against the metal doorplate. He felt the crunch of it as the nose eye smashed an
d the seeker went dead in his hand. 
\par Still, he held it\endash to be certain.
\par Paul's eyes came up, met the open stare of total blue from the Shadout Mapes.
\par \'93Your father has sent for you,\'94 she said. \'93There are men in the hall to escort you.\'94
\par Paul nodded, his eyes and awareness focusing on this odd woman in a sack-like dress of bondsman brown. She was looking now at the thing clutched in his hand.
\par \'93I've heard of suchlike,\'94 she said. \'93It would've killed me, not so?\'94 
\par He had to swallow before he could speak. \'93I\'85 was its target.\'94 
\par \'93But it was coming for me.\'94
\par \'93Because you were moving.\'94 And he wondered: Who is this creature?
\par \'93Then you saved my life,\'94 she said. 
\par \'93I saved both our lives.\'94
\par \'93Seems like you could've let it have me and made your own escape,\'94 she said.
\par \'93Who are you?\'94 he asked.
\par \'93The Shadout Mapes, housekeeper.\'94 
\par \'93How did you know where to find me?\'94
\par \'93Your mother told me. I met her at the stairs to the weirding room down the hall.\'94 She pointed to her right. \'93Your father's men are still waiting.\'94
\par Those will be Hawat's men, he thought. We must find the operator of this thing.
\par \'93Go to my father's men,\'94 he said. \'93Tell them I've caught a hunter-seeker in the house and they're to spread out and find the operator. Tell them to seal off the house and its grounds immediately. Th
ey'll know how to go about it. The operator's sure to be a stranger among us.\'94
\par And he wondered: Could it be this creature? But he knew it wasn't. The seeker had been under control when she entered.
\par \'93Before I do your bidding, manling,\'94 Mapes said, \'93I must cleanse the way between us. You've put a water burden on me that I'm not sure I care to support. But we Fremen pay our debts\endash 
be they black debts or white debts. And it's known to us that you've a traitor in your midst. Who it is, we cannot say, but we're certain sure of it. Mayhap there's the hand guided that flesh-cutter.\'94 
\par Paul absorbed this in silence: a traitor. Before he could speak, the odd woman whirled away and ran back toward the entry.
\par He thought to call her back, but there was an air about her that told him she would resent it. She'd told him what she knew and now she was going to do his bidding. The house would be swarming with Hawat's men in a minute.
\par His mind went to other parts of that strange conversation: weirding room. He looked to his left where she had pointed. We Fremen. So that was a Fremen. He paused for the mnemonic blink that would store the pattern of her face in his memory\endash 
prune-wrinkled features darkly browned, blue-on-blue eyes without any white in them. He attached the label: The Shadout Mapes.
\par Still gripping the shattered seeker, Paul turned back into his room, scooped up his shield belt from the bed with his left hand, swung it around his waist and buckled it as he ran back out and down the hall to the left.
\par She'd said his mother was someplace down here\endash stairs\'85 a weirding room.
\par 
\par 
\par What had the Lady Jessica to sustain her in her time of trial? Think you carefully on this Bene Gesserit proverb and perhaps you will see: \'93Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. 
Climb the mountain just a little bit to test that it's a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain.\'94
\par -from \'93Muad'Dib: Family Commentaries\'94 by the Princess Irulan
\par 
\par At the end of the south wing, Jessica found a metal stair spiraling up to an oval door. She glanced back down the hall, again up at the door.
\par Oval? she wondered. What an odd shape for a door in a house.
\par Through the windows beneath the spiral stair she could see the great white sun of Arrakis moving on toward evening. Long
 shadows stabbed down the hall. She returned her attention to the stairs. Harsh sidelighting picked out bits of dried earth on the open metalwork of the steps.
\par Jessica put a hand on the rail, began to climb. The rail felt cold under her sliding palm. She stopped at the door, saw it had no handle, but there was a faint depression on the surface of it where a handle should have been.
\par Surely not a palm lock, she told herself. A palm lock must be keyed to one individual's hand shape and palm lines. But it looked like a palm lock. And there were ways to open any palm lock\endash as she had learned at school.
\par Jessica glanced back to make certain she was unobserved, placed her palm against the depression in the door. The most gentle of pressures to distort the lines\endash a turn of the wrist, another turn, a sliding twist of the palm across the surface. 

\par She felt the click.
\par But there were hurrying footsteps in the hall beneath her. Jessica lifted her hand from the door, turned, saw Mapes come to the foot of the stairs.
\par \'93There are men in the great hall say they've been sent by the Duke to get young master Paul,\'94 Mapes said. \'93They've the ducal signet and the guard has identified them.\'94 She glanced at the door, back to Jessica.
\par A cautious one, this Mapes, Jessica thought. That's a good sign.
\par \'93He's in the fifth room from this end of the hall, the small bedroom,\'94 Jessica said. \'93If you have trouble waking him, call on Dr. Yueh in the next room. Paul may require a wakeshot.\'94 
\par Again, Mapes cast a piercing stare at the oval door, and Jessica thought she detected loathing in the expression. Before Jessica could ask about the door and what it concealed, Mapes had turned away, hurrying back down the hall.
\par Hawat certified this place, Jessica thought. There can't be anything too terrible in here.
\par She pushed the door. It swung inward onto a small room with another oval door opposite. The other door had a wheel handle.
\par An airlock! Jessica thought. She glanced down, saw a door prop fallen to the floor of the little room. The prop carried Hawat's per
sonal mark. The door was left propped open, she thought. Someone probably knocked the prop down accidentally, not realizing the outer door would close on a palm lock. 
\par She stepped over the lip into the little room.
\par Why an airlock in a house? she asked herself. And she thought suddenly of exotic creatures sealed off in special climates. 
\par Special climate!
\par That would make sense on Arrakis where even the driest of off-planet growing things had to be irrigated.
\par The door behind her began swinging closed. She caug
ht it and propped it open securely with the stick Hawat had left. Again, she faced the wheel-locked inner door, seeing now a faint inscription etched in the metal above the handle. She recognized Galach words, read:
\par \'93O, Man! Here is a lovely portion of God's Creation; then, stand before it and learn to love the perfection of Thy Supreme Friend.\'94 
\par Jessica put her weight on the wheel. It turned left and the inner door opened. A gentle draft feathered her cheek, stirred her hair. She felt change in the air, a 
richer taste. She swung the door wide, looked through into massed greenery with yellow sunlight pouring across it.
\par A yellow sun? she asked herself. Then: Filter glass! 
\par She stepped over the sill and the door swung closed behind. 
\par \'93A wet-planet conservatory,\'94 she breathed:
\par Potted plants and low-pruned trees stood all about. She recognized a mimosa, a flowering quince, a sondagi, green-blossomed pleniscenta, green and white striped akarso\'85 roses\'85 
\par Even roses!
\par She bent to breathe the fragrance of a giant pink blossom, straightened to peer around the room. 
\par Rhythmic noise invaded her senses.
\par She parted a jungle overlapping of leaves, looked through to the center of the room. A low fountain stood there, small with fluted lips. The rhythmic noise was a peeling, spooling arc of water falling thud-a-gallop onto the metal bowl.
\par Jessica sent herself through the quick sense-clearing regimen, began a methodical inspection of the room's perimeter. It appeared to be about ten meters square. From its placement above the end
 of the hall and from subtle differences in construction, she guessed it had been added onto the roof of this wing long after the original building's completion.
\par She stopped at the south limits of the room in front of the wide reach of filter glass, stared
 around. Every available space in the room was crowded with exotic wet-climate plants. Something rustled in the greenery. She tensed, then glimpsed a simple clock-set servok with pipe and hose arms. An arm lifted, sent out a fine spray of dampness that mi
sted her cheeks. The arm retracted and she looked at what it had watered: a fern tree.
\par Water everywhere in this room\endash on a planet where water was the most precious juice of life. Water being wasted so conspicuously that it shocked her to inner stillness.
\par She glanced out at the filter-yellowed sun. It hung low on a jagged horizon above cliffs that formed part of the immense rock uplifting known as the Shield Wall.
\par Filter glass, she thought. To turn a white sun into something softer and more familiar. Who could
 have built such a place? Leto? It would be like him to surprise me with such a gift, but there hasn't been time. And he's been busy with more serious problems.
\par She recalled the report that many Arrakeen houses were sealed by airlock doors and windows to c
onserve and reclaim interior moisture. Leto had said it was a deliberate statement of power and wealth for this house to ignore such precautions, its doors and windows being sealed only against the omnipresent dust.
\par But this room embodied a statement far more significant than the lack of waterseals on outer doors. She estimated that this pleasure room used water enough to support a thousand persons on Arrakis\endash possibly more.
\par Jessica moved along the window, continuing to stare into the room. The move brought 
into view a metallic surface at table height beside the fountain and she glimpsed a white notepad and stylus there partly concealed by an overhanging fan leaf. She crossed to the table, noted Hawat's daysigns on it, studied a message written on the pad:

\par 
\par  \'93TO THE LADY JESSICA\endash 
\par May this place give you as much pleasure as it has given me. Please permit the room to convey a lesson we learned from the same teachers: the proximity of a desirable thing tempts one to overindulgence. On that path lies danger.
\par  My kindest wishes,
\par  MARGOT LADY FENRING\'94
\par 
\par Jessica nodded, remembering that Leto had referred to the Emperor's former proxy here as Count Fenring. But the hidden message of the note demanded immediate attention, couched as it was in a way to inform her the writ
er was another Bene Gesserit. A bitter thought touched Jessica in passing: The Count married his Lady.
\par Even as this thought flicked through her mind, she was bending to seek out the hidden message. It had to be there. The visible note contained the code ph
rase every Bene Gesserit not bound by a School Injunction was required to give another Bene Gesserit when conditions demanded it: \'93On that path lies danger.\'94 
\par Jessica felt the back of the note, rubbed the surface for coded dots. Nothing. The edge of the pad came under her seeking fingers. Nothing. She replaced the pad where she had found it, feeling a sense of urgency.
\par Something in the position of the pad? she wondered.
\par But Hawat had been over this room, doubtless had moved the pad. She looked at the leaf a
bove the pad. The leaf! She brushed a finger along the under surface, along the edge, along the stem. It was there! Her fingers detected the subtle coded dots, scanned them in a single passage:
\par \'93Your son and Duke are in immediate danger. A bedroom has been designed to attract your son. The H loaded it with death traps to be discovered, leaving one that may escape detection.\'94
 Jessica put down the urge to run back to Paul; the full message had to be learned. Her fingers sped over the dots; \'93I do not know the 
exact nature of the menace, but it has something to do with a bed. The threat to your Duke involves defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant. The H plan to give you as gift to a minion. To the best of my knowledge, this conservatory is safe. Forgive
 that I cannot tell more. My sources are few as my Count is not in the pay of the H. In haste, MF.\'94
\par Jessica thrust the leaf aside, whirled to dash back to Paul. In that instant, the airlock door slammed open. Paul jumped through it, holding something in his
 right hand, slammed the door behind him. He saw his mother, pushed through the leaves to her, glanced at the fountain, thrust his hand and the thing it clutched under the falling water.
\par \'93Paul!\'94 She grabbed his shoulder, staring at the hand. \'93What is that?\'94
\par He spoke casually, but she caught the effort behind the tone: \'93Hunter-seeker. Caught it in my room and smashed its nose, but I want to be sure. Water should short it out.\'94 
\par \'93Immerse it!\'94 she commanded. 
\par He obeyed.
\par Presently, she said: \'93Withdraw your hand. Leave the thing in the water.\'94
\par He brought out his hand, shook water from it, staring at the quiescent metal in the fountain. Jessica broke off a plant stem, prodded the deadly sliver. 
\par It was dead.
\par She dropped the stem into the water, looked at Paul. His eyes studied the room with a searching intensity that she recognized\endash the B.G. Way.
\par \'93This place could conceal anything,\'94 he said. 
\par \'93I've reason to believe it's safe,\'94 she said. 
\par \'93My room was supposed to be safe, too. Hawat said\endash \'94 
\par \'93It was a hunter-seeker,\'94 she reminded him \'93That means someone inside the house to operate it. Seeker control beams have a limited range. The thing could've been spirited in here after Hawat's investigation.\'94
\par But she thought of the message of the leaf: \'93\'85 defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant.\'94 Not Hawat, surely. Oh, surely not Hawat.
\par \'93Hawat's men are searching the house right now,\'94 he said. \'93That seeker almost got the old woman who came to wake me.\'94
\par \'93The Shadout Mapes,\'94 Jessica said, remembering the encounter at the stairs. \'93A summons from your father to\endash \'94 
\par \'93That can wait,\'94 Paul said. \'93Why do you think this room's safe?\'94 
\par She pointed to the note, explained about it. 
\par He relaxed slightly.
\par But Jessica remained inwardly tense, thinking: A hunter-seeker! Merciful Mother! It took all her training to prevent a fit of hysterical trembling.
\par Paul spoke matter of factly: \'93It's the Harkonnens, of course. We shall have to destroy them.\'94
\par A rapping sounded at the airlock door\endash the code knock of one of Hawat's corps.
\par \'93Come in,\'94 Paul called.
\par The door swung wide and a tall man in Atreides uniform with a Hawat insignia on his cap leaned into the room. \'93There you are, sir,\'94 he said. \'93The housekeeper said you'd be here.\'94 He glanced around the room. \'93
We found a cairn in the cellar and caught a man in it. He had a seeker console.\'94 
\par \'93I'll want to take part in the interrogation,\'94 Jessica said. 
\par \'93Sorry, my Lady. We messed him up catching him. He died.\'94 
\par \'93Nothing to identify him?\'94 she asked. 
\par \'93We've found nothing yet, my Lady.\'94 
\par \'93Was he an Arrakeen native?\'94 Paul asked. 
\par Jessica nodded at the astuteness of the question.
\par \'93He has the native look,\'94 the man said. \'93Put into that cairn more'n a month ago, by the look, and left there to await our coming. Stone and mortar where he came through into the cellar we
re untouched when we inspected the place yesterday. I'll stake my reputation on it.\'94 
\par \'93No one questions your thoroughness,\'94 Jessica said.
\par \'93I question it, my Lady. We should've used sonic probes down there.\'94 
\par \'93I presume that's what you're doing now,\'94 Paul said. 
\par \'93Yes, sir.\'94
\par \'93Send word to my father that we'll be delayed.\'94 
\par \'93At once, sir.\'94 He glanced at Jessica. \'93It's Hawat's order that under such circumstances as these the young master be guarded in a safe place.\'94 Again, his eyes swept the room. \'93What of this place?\'94
\par \'93I've reason to believe it safe,\'94 she said. \'93Both Hawat and I have inspected it.\'94
\par \'93Then I'll mount guard outside here, m'Lady, until we've been over the house once more.\'94 He bowed, touched his cap to Paul, backed out and swung the door closed behind him.
\par Paul broke the sudden silence, saying: \'93Had we better go over the house later ourselves? Your eyes might see things others would miss.\'94
\par \'93This wing was the only place I hadn't examined,\'94 she said. \'93I put if off to last because\'85 \'94 
\par \'93Because Hawat gave it his personal attention,\'94 he said. 
\par She darted a quick look at his face, questioning. 
\par \'93Do you distrust Hawat?\'94 she asked.
\par \'93No, but he's getting old\'85 he's overworked. We could take some of the load from him.\'94
\par \'93That'd only shame him and impair his efficiency,\'94 she said. \'93A stray insect won't be able to wander into this wing after he hears about this. He'll be shamed that\'85 \'94 
\par \'93We must take our own measures,\'94 he said.
\par \'93Hawat has served three generations of Atreides with honor,\'94 she said. \'93He deserves every respect and trust we can pay him\'85 many times over.\'94
\par Paul said: \'93When my father is bothered by something you've done he says \lquote Bene Gesserit!\rquote  like a swear word.\'94 
\par \'93And what is it about me that bothers your father?\'94 
\par \'93When you argue with him.\'94 
\par \'93You are not your father, Paul.\'94
\par And Paul thought: It'll worry her, but I must tell her what that Mapes woman said about a traitor among us.
\par \'93What're you holding back?\'94 Jessica asked. \'93This isn't like you, Paul.\'94 
\par He shrugged, recounted the exchange with Mapes.
\par And Jessica thought of the message of the leaf. She came to sudden decision, showed Paul the leaf, told him its message.
\par \'93My father must learn of this at once,\'94 he said. \'93I'll radiograph it in code and get if off.\'94
\par \'93No,\'94 she said. \'93You will wait until you can see him alone. As few as possible must learn about it.\'94
\par \'93Do you mean we should trust no one?\'94
\par \'93There's another possibility,\'94 she said. \'93This message may have been meant to get to us. The people who gave it to us may believe it's true, but it may be that the only purpose was to get this message to us.\'94
\par Paul's face remained sturdily somber. \'93To sow distrust and suspicion in our ranks, to weaken us that way,\'94 he said.
\par \'93You must tell your father privately and caution him about this aspect of it, \'93 she said. 
\par \'93I understand.\'94
\par She turned to the tall reach of filter glass, stared out to the southwest where the sun of Arrakis was sinking\endash a yellowed ball above the cliffs.
\par Paul turned with her, said: \'93I don't think it's Hawat, either. Is it possible it's Yueh?\'94
\par \'93He's not a lieutenant or companion,\'94 she said. \'93And I can assure you he hates the Harkonnens as bitterly as we do.\'94 
\par Paul directed his attention to the cliffs, thinking: And it couldn't be Gurney\'85 or Duncan. Could it be one of the sub-lieutenants? Impossible. They're all from families that've been loyal to us for generations\endash for good reason.
\par Jessica rubbed her forehead, sensing her own fatigue. So much peril here! She looked out at the filter-yellowed landscape, studying it. Beyond the ducal grounds stretched a high-fenced storage yard\endash 
lines of spice silos in it with stilt-legged watchtowers standing around it like so many startled spiders. She could see at least twenty storage yards of silos reaching out to the cliffs of the Shield Wall\endash silos repeated, stuttering a
cross the basin.
\par Slowly, the filtered sun buried itself beneath the horizon. Stars leaped out. She saw one bright star so low on the horizon that it twinkled with a clear, precise rhythm\endash a trembling of light: blink-blink-blink-blink-blink\'85 
\par Paul stirred beside her in the dusky room.
\par But Jessica concentrated on that single bright star, realizing that it was too low, that it must come from the Shield Wall cliffs. 
\par Someone signaling!
\par She tried to read the message, but it was in no code she had ever learned.
\par Other lights had come on down on the plain beneath the cliffs: little yellows spaced out against blue darkness. And one light off to their left grew brighter, began to wink back at the cliff\endash very fast: blinksquirt, glimmer, blink!
\par And it was gone.
\par The false star in the cliff winked out immediately. 
\par Signals\'85 and they filled her with premonition.
\par Why were lights used to signal across the basin? she asked herself. Why couldn't they use the communications network?
\par The answer was obvious: the communinet was certain to be tapped now by agents of the Duke Leto. Light signals could only mean that messages were being sent between his enemies\endash between Harkonnen agents.
\par There came a tapping at the door behind them and the voice of Hawat's man; \'93All clear, sir\'85 m'Lady. Time to be getting the young master to his father.\'94
\par 
\par 
\par It is said that the Duke Leto blinded himself to the perils of Arrakis, that he walked heedlessly into the pit. Would it not be more likely to suggest he had lived so long in the presence of extreme dange
r he misjudged a change in its intensity? Or is it possible he deliberately sacrificed himself that his son might find a better life? All evidence indicates the Duke was a man not easily hoodwinked.
\par -from \'93Muad'Dib: Family Commentaries\'94 by the Princess Irulan
\par 
\par The Duke Leto Atreides leaned against a parapet of the landing control tower outside Arrakeen. The night's first moon, an oblate silver coin, hung well above the southern horizon. Beneath it, the jagged cliffs of the Shield Wall shone like parched ici
ng through a dust haze. To his left, the lights of Arrakeen glowed in the haze\endash yellow\'85 white\'85 blue.
\par He thought of the notices posted now above his signature all through the populous places of the planet: \'93Our Sublime Padishah Emperor has charged me to take possession of this planet and end all dispute.\'94
\par The ritualistic formality of it touched him with a feeling of loneliness. Who was fooled by that fatuous legalism? Not the Fremen, certainly. Nor the Houses Minor who controlled the interior trade of Arrakis\'85
 and were Harkonnen creatures almost to a man.
\par They have tried to take the life of my son!
\par The rage was difficult to suppress.
\par He saw lights of a moving vehicle coming toward the landing field from Arrakeen. He hoped it was the guard and troop carrier bringing Paul. The delay was galling even though he knew it was prompted by caution on the part of Hawat's lieutenant. 
\par They have tried to take the life of my son!
\par He shook his head to drive out the angry thoughts, glanced back at the field where five of his own frigates were posted around the rim like monolithic sentries.
\par Better a cautious delay than\'85 
\par The lieutenant was a good one, he reminded himself. A man marked for advancement, completely loyal.
\par \'93Our Sublime Padishah Emperor\'85 \'94
\par If the people of this decadent garrison city could only see the Emperor's private note to his \'93Noble Duke"\endash the disdainful allusions to veiled men and women: \'93\'85
 but what else is one to expect of barbarians whose dearest dream is to live outside the ordered security of the faufreluches?\'94
\par The Duke felt in this moment that his own dearest dream was to end all class distinctions and never again think of deadly order. He looked up and out of the dust at the unwinking stars, thought: Around one of those little lights circles Caladan\'85 but I
'll never again see my home. The longing for Caladan was a sudden pain in his breast. He felt that it did not come from within himself, but that it reached out to him from Caladan. He could not bring himself to call this dry wasteland of Arrakis his home,
 and he doubted he ever would.
\par I must mask my feelings, he thought. For the boy's sake. If ever he's to have a home, this must be it. I may think of Arrakis as a hell I've reached before death, but he must find here that which will inspire him. There must be something.
\par A wave of self-pity, immediately despised and rejected, swept through him, and for some reason he found himself recalling two lines from a poem Gurney Halleck often repeated\endash 
\par 
\par \'93My lungs taste the air of Time 
\par Blown past falling sands\'85 \'94
\par 
\par Well, Gurney would find plenty of falling sands here, the Duke thought. The central wastelands beyond those moon-frosted cliffs were desert\endash 
barren rock, dunes, and blowing dust, an uncharted dry wilderness with here and there along its rim and perhaps scattered through it, knots of Fremen. If anything could buy a future for the Atreides line, the Fremen just might do it.
\par Provided the Harkonnens hadn't managed to infect even the Fremen with their poisonous schemes. 
\par They have tried to take the life of my son!
\par A scraping metal racket vibrated through the tower, shook the parapet beneath his arms. Blast shutters dropped in front of him, blocking the view.
\par Shuttle's coming in, he thought. Time to go down and get to work. He turned to the stairs behind him, headed down to the big assembly room, trying to remain calm as he descended, to prepare his face for the coming encounter. 
\par They have tried to take the life of my son!
\par The men were already boiling in from the field when he reached the yellow-domed room. They carried their spacebags over their shoulders, shouting and roistering like students returning from vacation.
\par \'93Hey! Feel that under your dogs? That's gravity, man!\'94 \'93How many G's does this place pull? Feels heavy.\'94 \'93Nine-tenths of a G by the book.\'94 
\par The crossfire of thrown words filled the big room.
\par \'93Did you get a good look at this hole on the way down? Where's all the loot this place's supposed to have?\'94 \'93The Harkonnens took it with \lquote em!\'94 \'93Me for a hot shower and a soft bed!\'94 \'93Haven't you heard, stupid? No showers
 down here. You scrub your ass with sand!\'94 \'93Hey! Can it! The Duke!\'94
\par The Duke stepped out of the stair entry into a suddenly silent room.
\par Gurney Halleck strode along at the point of the crowd, bag over one shoulder, the neck of his nine-string baliset clutc
hed in the other hand. They were long-fingered hands with big thumbs, full of tiny movements that drew such delicate music from the baliset.
\par The Duke watched Halleck, admiring the ugly lump of a man, noting the glass-splinter eyes with their gleam of savage understanding. Here was a man who lived outside the faufreluches while obeying their every precept. What was it Paul had called him? 

\par \'93Gurney, the valorous.\'94
\par Halleck's wispy blond hair trailed across barren spots on his head. His wide mouth was twisted i
nto a pleasant sneer, and the scar of the inkvine whip slashed across his jawline seemed to move with a life of its own. His whole air was of casual, shoulder-set capability. He came up to the Duke, bowed. 
\par \'93Gurney,\'94 Leto said.
\par \'93My Lord.\'94 He gestured with the baliset toward the men in the room. \'93This is the last of them. I'd have preferred coming in with the first wave, but\'85 \'94
\par \'93There are still some Harkonnens for you,\'94 the Duke said. \'93Step aside with me, Gurney, where we may talk.\'94 
\par \'93Yours to command, my Lord.\'94
\par They moved into an alcove beside a coil-slot water machine while the men stirred restlessly in the big room. Halleck dropped his bag into a corner, kept his grip on the baliset.
\par \'93How many men can you let Hawat have?\'94 the Duke asked. 
\par \'93Is Thufir in trouble. Sire?\'94
\par \'93He's lost only two agents, but his advance men gave us an excellent line on the entire Harkonnen setup here. If we move fast we may gain a measure of security, the breathing space we require. He wants as many men as you can spare\endash men who won'
t balk at a little knife work.\'94
\par \'93I can let him have three hundred of my best,\'94 Halleck said. \'93Where shall I send them?\'94
\par \'93To the main gate. Hawat has an agent there waiting to take them.\'94 
\par \'93Shall I get about it at once, Sire?\'94
\par \'93In a moment. We have another 
problem. The field commandant will hold the shuttle here until dawn on a pretext. The Guild Heighliner that brought us is going on about its business, and the shuttle's supposed to make contact with a cargo ship taking up a load of spice.\'94 
\par \'93Our spice, m'Lord?\'94
\par \'93Our spice. But the shuttle also will carry some of the spice hunters from the old regime. They've opted to leave with the change of fief and the Judge of the Change is allowing it. These are valuable workers, Gurney, about eight hundred of them. Bef
ore the shuttle leaves, you must persuade some of those men to enlist with us.\'94 
\par \'93How strong a persuasion, Sire?\'94
\par \'93I want their willing cooperation, Gurney. Those men have experience and skills we need. The fact that they're leaving suggests they're not pa
rt of the Harkonnen machine. Hawat believes there could be some bad ones planted in the group, but he sees assassins in every shadow.\'94
\par \'93Thufir has found some very productive shadows in his time, m'Lord.\'94
\par \'93And there are some he hasn't found. But I think planting sleepers in this outgoing crowd would show too much imagination for the Harkonnens.\'94
\par \'93Possibly, Sire. Where are these men?\'94
\par \'93Down on the lower level, in a waiting room. I suggest you go down and play a tune or two to soften their minds, then turn on 
the pressure. You may offer positions of authority to those who qualify. Offer twenty per cent higher wages than they received under the Harkonnens.\'94
\par \'93No more than that, Sire? I know the Harkonnen pay scales. And to men with their termination pay in their pockets and the wanderlust on them\'85 well. Sire, twenty per cent would hardly seem proper inducement to stay.\'94
\par Leto spoke impatiently: \'93Then use your own discretion in particular cases. Just remember that the treasury isn't bottomless. Hold it to twenty per cent whenever you can. We particularly need spice drivers, weather scanners, dune men\endash 
any with open sand experience.\'94
\par \'93I understand, Sire. \lquote They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity of the sand.\rquote  \'93
\par \'93A very moving quotation,\'94 the Duke said. \'93Turn your crew over to a lieutenant. Have him give a short drill on water discipline, then bed the men down for the night in the barracks adjoining the field. Field personnel will direct them. And do
n't forget the men for Hawat.\'94
\par \'93Three hundred of the best, Sire.\'94 He took up his spacebag. \'93Where shall I report to you when I've completed my chores?\'94 
\par \'93I've taken over a council room topside here. We'll hold staff there. I want to arrange a new planetary dispersal order with armored squads going out first.\'94
\par Halleck stopped in the act of turning away, caught Leto's eye. \'93Are you anticipating that kind of trouble, Sire? I thought there was a Judge of the Change here.\'94
\par \'93Both open battle and secret,\'94 the Duke said. \'93There'll be blood aplenty spilled here before we're through.\'94 
\par \'93 \lquote And the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land,\rquote  \'93 Halleck quoted. 
\par The Duke sighed. \'93Hurry back, Gurney.\'94
\par \'93Very good, m'Lord.\'94 The whipscar rippled to his grin. \'93 \lquote Behold, as a wild ass in the desert, go I forth to my work.\rquote  \'93 He turned, strode to the center of the room, paused to relay his orders, hurried on through the men.
\par Leto shook his head at the retreating back. Halleck was a continual amazement\endash a head full of songs, quotations, and flowery phrases\'85 and the heart of an assassin when it came to dealing with the Harkonnens.
\par Presently, Leto took a leisurely diagonal course across to the lift, acknowledging salutes with a casual hand wave. He 
recognized a propaganda corpsman, stopped to give him a message that could be relayed to the men through channels: those who had brought their women would want to know the women were safe and where they could be found. The others would wish to know that t
he population here appeared to boast more women than men.
\par The Duke slapped the propaganda man on the arm, a signal that the message had top priority to be put out immediately, then continued across the room. He nodded to the men, smiled, traded pleasantries with a subaltern.
\par Command must always look confident, he thought. All that faith riding on your shoulders while you sit in the critical seat and never show it.
\par He breathed a sigh of relief when the lift swallowed him and he could turn and face the impersonal doors.
\par They have tried to take the life of my son!
\par 
\par 
\par Over the exit of the Arrakeen landing field, crudely carved as though with a poor instrument, there was an inscription that Muad'Dib was to repeat many times. He saw it that first night on Arrakis, h
aving been brought to the ducal command post to participate in his father's first full staff conference. The words of the inscription were a plea to those leaving Arrakis, but they fell with dark import on the eyes of a boy who had just escaped a close br
ush with death. They said: \'93O you who know what we suffer here, do not forget us in your prayers. \'93
\par -from \'93Manual of Muad'Dib\'94 by the Princess Irulan
\par 
\par \'93The whole theory of warfare is calculated risk,\'94 the Duke said, \'93but when it comes to risking your own family, the element of calculation gets submerged in\'85 other things.\'94 
\par He knew he wasn't holding in his anger as well as he should, and he turned, strode down the length of the long table and back.
\par The Duke and Paul were alone in the conference room at the la
nding field. It was an empty-sounding room, furnished only with the long table, old-fashioned three-legged chairs around it, and a map board and projector at one end. Paul sat at the table near the map board. He had told his father the experience with the
 hunter-seeker and given the reports that a traitor threatened him.
\par The Duke stopped across from Paul, pounded the table: \'93Hawat told me that house was secure!\'94
\par Paul spoke hesitantly: \'93I was angry, too\endash at first. And I blamed Hawat. But the threat came from outside the house. It was simple, clever, and direct. And it would've succeeded were it not for the training given me by you and many others\endash 
including Hawat.\'94 
\par \'93Are you defending him?\'94 the Duke demanded. 
\par \'93Yes.\'94 
\par \'93He's getting old. That's it. He should be\endash \'94
\par \'93He's wise with much experience,\'94 Paul said. \'93How many of Hawat's mistakes can you recall?\'94
\par \'93I should be the one defending him,\'94 the Duke said. \'93Not you.\'94 
\par Paul smiled.
\par Leto sat down at the head of the table, put a hand over his son's. \'93You've\'85 matured lately, Son.\'94 He lifted his hand. \'93It gladdens me.\'94 He matched his son's smile. \'93
Hawat will punish himself. He'll direct more anger against himself over this than both of us together could pour on him.\'94
\par Paul glanced toward the darkened windows beyond the ma
p board, looked at the night's blackness. Room lights reflected from a balcony railing out there. He saw movement and recognized the shape of a guard in Atreides uniform. Paul looked back at the white wall behind his father, then down to the shiny surface
 of the table, seeing his own hands clenched into fists there.
\par The door opposite the Duke banged open. Thufir Hawat strode through it looking older and more leathery than ever. He paced down the length of the table, stopped at attention facing Leto.
\par \'93My Lord,\'94 he said, speaking to a point over Leto's head, \'93I have just learned how I failed you. It becomes necessary that I tender my resig\endash \'94
\par \'93Oh, sit down and stop acting the fool,\'94 the Duke said. He waved to the chair across from Paul. \'93If you made a mistake, 
it was in overestimating the Harkonnens. Their simple minds came up with a simple trick. We didn't count on simple tricks. And my son has been at great pains to point out to me that he came through this largely because of your training. You didn't fail th
ere!\'94 He tapped the back of the empty chair. \'93Sit down, I say!\'94 
\par Hawat sank into the chair. \'93But\endash \'94
\par \'93I'll hear no more of it,\'94 the Duke said. \'93The incident is past. We have more pressing business. Where are the others?\'94 
\par \'93I asked them to wait outside while I\endash \'94 
\par \'93Call them in.\'94 
\par Hawat looked into Leto's eyes. \'93Sire, I\endash \'94
\par \'93I know who my true friends are, Thufir,\'94 the Duke said. \'93Call in the men.\'94
\par Hawat swallowed. \'93At once, my Lord.\'94 He swiveled in the chair, called to the open door: \'93Gurney, bring them in.\'94 
\par Hal
leck led the file of men into the room, the staff officers looking grimly serious followed by the younger aides and specialists, an air of eagerness among them. Brief scuffing sounds echoed around the room as the men took seats. A faint smell of rachag st
imulant wafted down the table.
\par \'93There's coffee for those who want it,\'94 the Duke said.
\par He looked over his men, thinking: They're a good crew. A man could do far worse for this kind of war. He waited while coffee was brought in from the adjoining room and served, noting the tiredness in some of the faces.
\par Presently, he put on his mask of quiet efficiency, stood up and commanded their attention with a knuckle rap against the table.
\par \'93Well, gentlemen,\'94 he said, \'93our civilization appears to've fallen so deeply into the habit of invasion that we cannot even obey a simple order of the Imperium without the old ways cropping up.\'94 
\par Dry chuckles sounded around the table, and Paul realized that his father had said the precisely correct thing in precisely the correct tone to lift the mood here. Even the hint of fatigue in his voice was right.
\par \'93I think first we'd better learn if Thufir has anything to add to his report on the Fremen,\'94 the Duke said. \'93Thufir?\'94 
\par Hawat glanced up. \'93I've some economic matters to go into after my
 general report, Sire, but I can say now that the Fremen appear more and more to be the allies we need. They're waiting now to see if they can trust us, but they appear to be dealing openly. They've sent us a gift\endash 
stillsuits of their own manufacture\'85 maps of certain desert areas surrounding strongpoints the Harkonnens left behind,\'85\'94 He glanced down at the table. \'93
Their intelligence reports have proved completely reliable and have helped us considerably in our dealings with the Judge of the Change. They've also sent some incidental things\endash 
jewelry for the Lady Jessica, spice liquor, candy, medicinals. My men are processing the lot right now. There appears to be no trickery.\'94 
\par \'93You like these people, Thufir?\'94 asked a man down the table.
\par Hawat turned to face his questioner. \'93Duncan Idaho says they're to be admired.\'94
\par Paul glanced at his father, back to Hawat, ventured a question: \'93Have you any new information on how many Fremen there are?\'94 
\par Hawat looked at Paul. \'93From food processing and other evidence, Idaho esti
mates the cave complex he visited consisted of some ten thousand people, all told. Their leader said he ruled a sietch of two thousand hearths. We've reason to believe there are a great many such sietch communities. All seem to give their allegiance to so
meone called Liet.\'94 
\par \'93That's something new,\'94 Leto said.
\par \'93It could be an error on my part, Sire. There are things to suggest this Liet may be a local deity.\'94
\par Another man down the table cleared his throat, asked: \'93Is it certain they deal with the smugglers?\'94
\par \'93A smuggler caravan left this sietch while Idaho was there, carrying a heavy load of spice. They used pack beasts and indicated they faced an eighteen-day journey.\'94
\par \'93It appears,\'94 the Duke said, \'93that the smugglers have redoubled their operations during this period of unrest. This deserves some careful thought. We shouldn't worry too much about unlicensed frigates working off our planet\endash 
it's always done. But to have them completely outside our observation\endash that's not good.\'94 
\par \'93You have a plan. Sire,\'94 Hawat asked.
\par The Duke looked at Halleck. \'93Gurney, I want you to head a delegation, an embassy if you will, to contact these romantic businessmen. Tell them I'll ignore their operations as long as they give me a ducal tithe. Hawat here estimates that graft and extra
 fighting men heretofore required in their operations have been costing them four times that amount.\'94
\par \'93What if the Emperor gets wind of this?\'94 Halleck asked. \'93He's very jealous of his CHOAM profits, m'Lord.\'94
\par Leto smiled. \'93We'll bank the entire tithe openly
 in the name of Shaddam IV and deduct it legally from our levy support costs. Let the Harkonnens fight that! And we'll be ruining a few more of the locals who grew fat under the Harkonnen system. No more graft!\'94 
\par A grin twisted Halleck's face. \'93Ahh, m'Lord, a beautiful low blow. Would that I could see the Baron's face when he learns of this.\'94
\par The Duke turned to Hawat. \'93Thufir, did you get those account books you said you could buy?\'94
\par \'93Yes, my Lord. They're being examined in detail even now. I've skimmed them, though, and can give a first approximation.\'94 
\par \'93Give it, then.\'94
\par \'93The Harkonnens took ten billion Solaris out of here every three hundred and thirty Standard days.\'94
\par A muted gasp ran around the table. Even the younger aides, who had been betraying some boredom, sat up straighter and exchanged wide-eyed looks.
\par Halleck murmured: \'93 \lquote For they shall suck of the abundance of the seas and of the treasure hid in the sand.\rquote  \'93
\par \'93You see, gentlemen,\'94 Leto said. \'93Is there anyone here so naive he believes the Harkonnens have quietly packed up and walked away from all this merely because the Emperor ordered it?\'94 
\par There was a general shaking of heads, murmurous agreement.
\par \'93We will have to take it at the point of the sword,\'94 Leto said. He turned to Hawat. \'93This'd be a good point to report on equipment. How many sandcrawlers, harvesters, spice factories, and supporting equipment have they left us?\'94
\par \'93A full complement, as it says in the Imperial inventory audited by the Judge of the Change, my Lord,\'94 Hawat said. He gestured for an aide to pass him a folder, opened the folder on the table in front of him. \'93
They neglect to mention that less than half the crawlers are operable, that only about a third have carryalls to fly them to spice sands\endash that everything the Harkonnens left us i
s ready to break down and fall apart. We'll be lucky to get half the equipment into operation and luckier yet if a fourth of it's still working six months from now.\'94
\par \'93Pretty much as we expected,\'94 Leto said. \'93What's the firm estimate on basic equipment?\'94
\par Hawat glanced at his folder. \'93About nine hundred and thirty harvester-factories that can be sent out in a few days. About sixty-two hundred and fifty ornithopters for survey, scouting, and weather observation\'85 carryalls, a little under a thousand.
\'94 
\par Halleck said: \'93Wouldn't it be cheaper to reopen negotiations with the Guild for permission to orbit a frigate as a weather satellite?\'94 
\par The Duke looked at Hawat. \'93Nothing new there, eh, Thufir?\'94 
\par \'93We must pursue other avenues for now,\'94 Hawat said. \'93The Guild agent wasn't really negotiating with us. He was merely making it plain\endash one Mentat to another\endash 
that the price was out of our reach and would remain so no matter how long a reach we develop. Our task is to find out why before we approach him again.\'94
\par One of Halleck's aides down the table swiveled in his chair, snapped: \'93There's no justice in this!\'94
\par \'93Justice?\'94 The Duke looked at the man. \'93Who asks for justice? We make our own justice. We make it here on Arrakis\endash win or die, Do you regret casting your lot with us, sir?\'94
\par The man stared at the Duke, then: \'93No, Sire. You couldn't turn and I could do nought but follow you. Forgive the outburst, but\'85\'94 He shrugged. \'93\'85 we must all feel bitter at times.\'94 
\par \'93Bitterness I understand,\'94 the Duke said. \'93But let us not rail about just
ice as long as we have arms and the freedom to use them. Do any of the rest of you harbor bitterness? If so, let it out. This is friendly council where any man may speak his mind.\'94 
\par Halleck stirred, said: \'93I think what rankles, Sire, is that we've had no volunteers from the other Great Houses. They address you as \lquote Leto the Just\rquote  and promise eternal friendship, but only as long as it doesn't cost them anything.\'94

\par \'93They don't know yet who's going to win this exchange,\'94 the Duke said. \'93Most of the Houses have grown fat by taking few risks. One cannot truly blame them for this; one can only despise them.\'94 He looked at Hawat. \'93
We were discussing equipment. Would you care to project a few examples to familiarize the men with this machinery?\'94 
\par Hawat nodded, gestured to an aide at the projector.
\par A solido tri-D projection appeared on the table surface about a third of the way down from the Duke. Some of the men farther along the table stood up to get a better look at it. 
\par Paul leaned forward, staring at the machine.
\par Scaled against the tiny projected human figures around it, the thing was about one hundred and twenty meters long and about forty meters wide. It was basically a long, bug-like body moving on independent sets of wide tracks.
\par \'93This is a harvester factory,\'94 Hawat said. \'93We chose one in good repair for this projection. There's one dragline outfit that came in with the first team of Imperial ecologists, though, and it's still running\'85 although I don't know how\'85
 or why.\'94 
\par \'93If that's the one they call \lquote Old Maria,\rquote  it belongs in a museum,\'94 an aide said. \'93I think the Harkonnens kept it as a punishment job, a threat hanging over their workers\rquote  heads. Be good or you'll be assigned to \lquote 
Old Maria.\rquote  \'93
\par Chuckles sounded around the table.
\par Paul held himself apart from the humor, his attention focused on the projection and the question that filled his mind. He pointed to the image on the table, said: \'93Thufir, are there sandworms big enough to swallow that whole?\'94
\par Quick silence settled on the table. The Duke cursed under his breath, then thought: No\endash they have to face the realities here.
\par \'93There're worms in the deep desert could take this entire factory in one gulp,\'94 Hawat said. \'93Up here closer to the Shield Wall where most of the spicing's done there are plenty of worms that could 
cripple this factory and devour it at their leisure.\'94  
\par \'93Why don't we shield them?\'94 Paul asked.
\par \'93According to Idaho's report,\'94 Hawat said, \'93shields are dangerous in the desert. A body-size shield will call every worm for hundreds of meters around. It appea
rs to drive them into a killing frenzy. We've the Fremen word on this and no reason to doubt it. Idaho saw no evidence of shield equipment at the sietch.\'94 
\par \'93None at all?\'94 Paul asked.
\par \'93It'd be pretty hard to conceal that kind of thing among several thousand people,\'94 Hawat said. \'93Idaho had free access to every part of the sietch. He saw no shields or any indication of their use.\'94 
\par \'93It's a puzzle,\'94 the Duke said.
\par \'93The Harkonnens certainly used plenty of shields here,\'94 Hawat said. \'93They had repair depots in every garrison village, and their accounts show a heavy expenditure for shield replacements and parts.\'94
\par \'93Could the Fremen have a way of nullifying shields?\'94 Paul asked.
\par \'93It doesn't seem likely,\'94 Hawat said. \'93It's theoretically possible, of course\endash a shire-sized static counter charge is supposed to do the trick, but no one's ever been able to put it to the test.\'94 
\par \'93We'd have heard about it before now,\'94 Halleck said. \'93The smugglers have close contact with the Fremen and would've acquired such a device if it were available. And they'd have had no inhibitions against marketing it off planet.\'94
\par \'93I don't like an unanswered question of this importance,\'94 Leto said. \'93Thufir, I want you to give top priority to solution of this problem.\'94
\par \'93We're already working on it, my Lord.\'94 He cleared his throat. \'93Ah-h, Idaho did say one thing: he said you couldn't mistake the Fremen attitude toward shields. He said they were mostly amused by them.\'94
\par The Duke frowned, then: \'93The subject under discussion is spicing equipment.\'94
\par Hawat gestured to his aide at the projector.
\par The solido-image of the harvester-factory was replaced by a projection of a winged device that dwarfed the images of human figures around it. \'93This is a carryall,\'94 Hawat said. \'93It's essentially a large \lquote thopter, whose sole f
unction is to deliver a factory to spice-rich sands, then to rescue the factory when a sandworm appears. They always appear. Harvesting the spice is a process of getting in and getting out with as much as possible.\'94 
\par \'93Admirably suited to Harkonnen morality,\'94 the Duke said. 
\par Laughter was abrupt and too loud.
\par An ornithopter replaced the carryall in the projection focus.
\par \'93These \lquote thopters are fairly conventional,\'94 Hawat said. \'93Major modifications give them extended range. Extra care has been used in sealing essential areas against sand and dust. Only about one in thirty is shielded\endash 
possibly discarding the shield generator's weight for greater range.\'94
\par \'93I don't like this de-emphasis on shields,\'94 the Duke muttered. And he thought: Is this the Harkonnen secret? Does
 it mean we won't even be able to escape on shielded frigates if all goes against us? He shook his head sharply to drive out such thoughts, said: \'93Let's get to the working estimate. What'll our profit figure be?\'94
\par Hawat turned two pages in his notebook. \'93After assessing the repairs and operable equipment, we've worked out a first estimate on operating costs. It's based naturally on a depreciated figure for a clear safety margin.\'94
 He closed his eyes in Mentat semitrance, said: \'93Under the Harkonnens, maintenan
ce and salaries were held to fourteen per cent. We'll be lucky to make it at thirty per cent at first. With reinvestment and growth factors accounted for, including the CHOAM percentage and military costs, our profit margin will be reduced to a very narro
w six or seven per cent until we can replace worn-out equipment. We then should be able to boost it up to twelve or fifteen per cent where it belongs.\'94 He opened his eyes. \'93Unless my Lord wishes to adopt Harkonnen methods.\'94 
\par \'93We're working for a solid and permanent planetary base,\'94 the Duke said. \'93We have to keep a large percentage of the people happy\endash especially the Fremen.\'94 
\par \'93Most especially the Fremen,\'94 Hawat agreed.
\par \'93Our supremacy on Caladan,\'94 the Duke said, \'93depended on sea and air power. Here, we must develop something I choose to call desert power. This may include air power, but it's possible it may not. I call your attention to the lack of \lquote 
thopter shields.\'94 He shook his head. \'93The Harkonnens relied on turnover from off planet for some of their key personnel. We don't dare. Each new lot would have its quota of provocateurs.\'94
\par \'93Then we'll have to be content with far less profit and a reduced harvest,\'94 Hawat said. \'93Our output the first two seasons should be down a third from the Harkonnen average.\'94
\par \'93There it is,\'94 the Duke said, \'93exactly as we expected. We'll have to move fast with the Fremen. I'd like five full battalions of Fremen troops before the first CHOAM audit.\'94 
\par \'93That's not much time, Sire,\'94 Hawat said.
\par \'93We don't have much time, as you well know. They'll be here with Sardaukar disguised as Harkonnens at the first opportunity. How many do you think they'll ship in, Thufir?\'94 
\par \'93Four or five battalions all told, Sire. No more. Guild troop-transport costs being what they are.\'94
\par \'93Then five battalions of Fremen plus our own forces ought to do it. Let us have a few captive Sardaukar to parade in front of the Landsraad Council and matters will be much different\endash profits or no profits.\'94 
\par \'93We'll do our best, Sire.\'94
\par Paul looked at his father, back to Hawat, sudden
ly conscious of the Mentat's great age, aware that the old man had served three generations of Atreides. Aged. It showed in the rheumy shine of the brown eyes, in the cheeks cracked and burned by exotic weathers, in the rounded curve of the shoulders and 
the thin set of his lips with the cranberry-colored stain of sapho juice.
\par So much depends on one aged man, Paul thought.
\par \'93We're presently in a war of assassins,\'94 the Duke said, \'93but it has not achieved full scale. Thufir, what's the condition of the Harkonnen machine here?\'94
\par \'93We've eliminated two hundred and fifty-nine of their key people, my Lord. No more than three Harkonnen cells remain\endash perhaps a hundred people in all.\'94
\par \'93These Harkonnen creatures you eliminated,\'94 the Duke said, \'93were they propertied?\'94 
\par \'93Most were well situated, my Lord\endash in the entrepreneur class.\'94 
\par \'93I want you to forge certificates of allegiance over the signatures of each of them,\'94 the Duke said. \'93File copies with the Judge of the Change. We'll take the legal position that they stayed under
 false allegiance. Confiscate their property, take everything, turn out their families, strip them. And make sure the Crown gets its ten per cent. It must be entirely legal.\'94
\par Thufir smiled, revealing red-stained teeth beneath the carmine lips. \'93A move worthy of your grandsire, my Lord. It shames me I didn't think of it first.\'94
\par Halleck frowned across the table, surprised a deep scowl on Paul's face. The others were smiling and nodding.
\par It's wrong, Paul thought. This'll only make the others fight all the harder. They've nothing to gain by surrendering.
\par He knew the actual no-holds-barred convention that ruled in kanly, but this was the sort of move that could destroy them even as it gave them victory.
\par \'93 \lquote I have been a stranger in a strange land,\rquote  \'93 Halleck quoted.
\par Paul stared at him, recognizing the quotation from the O.C. Bible, wondering: Does Gurney, too, wish an end to devious plots?
\par The Duke glanced at the darkness out the windows, looked back at Halleck. \'93Gurney, how many of those sandworkers did you persuade to stay with us?\'94
\par \'93Two hundred eighty-six in all, Sire. I think we should take them and consider ourselves lucky. They're all in useful categories.\'94 
\par \'93No more?\'94 The Duke pursed his lips, then: \'93Well, pass the word along to\endash \'94
\par A disturbance at the door interrupted him. Duncan Idaho came through the guard there, hurried down the length of the table and bent over the Duke's ear.
\par Leto waved him back, said: \'93Speak out, Duncan. You can see this is strategy staff.\'94
\par Paul studied Idaho, marking the feline movemen
ts, the swiftness of reflex that made him such a difficult weapons teacher to emulate. Idaho's dark round face turned toward Paul, the cave-sitter eyes giving no hint of recognition, but Paul recognized the mask of serenity over excitement.
\par Idaho looked down the length of the table, said: \'93
We've taken a force of Harkonnen mercenaries disguised as Fremen. The Fremen themselves sent us a courier to warn of the false band. In the attack, however, we found the Harkonnens had waylaid the Fremen courier\endash badly wou
nded him. We were bringing him here for treatment by our medics when he died. I'd seen how badly off the man was and stopped to do what I could. I surprised him in the attempt to throw something away.\'94 Idaho glanced down at Leto. \'93
A knife, m'Lord, a knife the like of which you've never seen.\'94 
\par \'93Crysknife?\'94 someone asked.
\par \'93No doubt of it,\'94 Idaho said. \'93Milky white and glowing with a light of its own like.\'94 He reached into his tunic, brought out a sheath with a black-ridged handle protruding from it.
\par \'93Keep that blade in its sheath!\'94
\par The voice came from the open door at the end of the room, a vibrant and penetrating voice that brought them all up, staring.
\par A tall, robed figure stood in the door, barred by the crossed swords of the guard. A light tan robe completely enveloped the man except for a gap in the hood and black veil that exposed eyes of total blue\endash no white in them at all. 
\par \'93Let him enter,\'94 Idaho whispered. 
\par \'93Pass that man,\'94 the Duke said.
\par The guards hesitated, then lowered their swords. 
\par The man swept into the room, stood across from the Duke.
\par \'93This is Stilgar, chief of the sietch I visited, leader of those who warned us of the false band,\'94 Idaho said.
\par \'93Welcome, sir,\'94 Leto said. \'93And why shouldn't we unsheath this blade?\'94
\par Stilgar glanced at Idaho, said: \'93You observed the customs of cleanliness and honor among us. I would permit you to see the blade of the man you befriended.\'94 His gaze swept the others in the room. \'93
But I do not know these others. Would you have them defile an honorable weapon?\'94
\par \'93I am the Duke Leto,\'94 the Duke said. \'93Would you permit me to see this blade?\'94
\par \'93I'll permit you to earn the right to unsheath it,\'94 Stilgar said, and, as a mutter of protest sounded around the table, he raised a thin, darkly veined hand. \'93I remind you this is the blade of one who befriended you.\'94
\par In the waiting silence, Paul studied the man, sensing the aura of power that radiated from him. He was a leader\endash a Fremen leader.
\par A man near the center of the table across from Paul muttered: \'93Who's he to tell us what rights we have on Arrakis?\'94 
\par \'93It is said that the Duke Leto Atreides rules with the consent of the governed,\'94 the Fremen said. \'93Thus I must tell you the way it is with us: a certain responsibility falls on those who have seen a crysknife.\'94 He passed a dark glance 
across Idaho. \'93They are ours. They may never leave Arrakis without our consent.\'94 
\par Halleck and several of the others started to rise, angry expressions on their faces. Halleck said: \'93The Duke Leto determines whether\endash \'94
\par \'93One moment, please,\'94 Leto said, and the very mildness of his voice held them. This must not get out of hand, he thought. He addressed himself to the Fremen: \'93
Sir, I honor and respect the personal dignity of any man who respects my dignity. I am indeed indebted to you. And I always pay my debts. If it is your custom that this knife remain sheathed here, then it is so ordered\endash 
by me. And if there is any other way we may honor the man who died in our service, you have but to name it.\'94
\par The Fremen stared at the Duke, then slowly pulled aside his veil, revealing a thin nose and full-lipped mouth in a glistening black beard. Deliberately he bent over the end of the table, spat on its polished surface.
\par As the men around the table started to surge to their feet, Idaho's voice boomed across the room: \'93Hold!\'94
\par Into the sudden charged stillness, Idaho said: \'93We thank you, Stilgar, for the gift of your body's moisture. We accept it in the spirit with which it is given.\'94 And Idaho spat on the table in front of the Duke.
\par Aside to the Duke, he said; \'93Remember how precious water is here, Sire. That was a token of respect.\'94
\par Leto sank back into his own chair, caught Paul's eye, a rueful grin on his son's face, sensed the slow relaxation of tension around the table as understanding came to his men.
\par The Fremen looked at Idaho, said: \'93You measured well in my sietch, Duncan Idaho. Is there a bond on your allegiance to your Duke?\'94 
\par \'93He's asking me to enlist with him. Sire,\'94 Idaho said. 
\par \'93Would he accept a dual allegiance?\'94 Leto asked. 
\par \'93You wish me to go with him, Sire?\'94
\par \'93I wish you to make your own decision in the matter,\'94 Leto said, and he could not keep the urgency out of his voice.
\par Idaho studied the Fremen. \'93Would you have me under these conditions, Stilgar? There'd be times when I'd have to return to serve my Duke.\'94
\par \'93You fight well and you did your best for our friend,\'94 Stilgar said. He looked at Leto. \'93
Let it be thus: the man Idaho keeps the crysknife he holds as a mark of his allegiance to us. He must be cleansed, of course, and the rites observed, but this can be done
. He will be Fremen and soldier of the Atreides. There is precedent for this: Liet serves two masters.\'94 
\par \'93Duncan?\'94 Leto asked.
\par \'93I understand, Sire,\'94 Idaho said. 
\par \'93It is agreed, then,\'94 Leto said.
\par \'93Your water is ours, Duncan Idaho.\'94 Stilgar said. \'93The body of our friend remains with your Duke. His water is Atreides water. It is a bond between us.\'94
\par Leto sighed, glanced at Hawat, catching the old Mentat's eye. Hawat nodded, his expression pleased.
\par \'93I will await below,\'94 Stilgar said, \'93while Idaho makes farewell with his friends. Turok was the name of our dead friend. Remember that when it comes time to release his spirit. You are friends of Turok.\'94 
\par Stilgar started to turn away.
\par \'93Will you not stay a while?\'94 Leto asked.
\par The Fremen turned back, whipping his veil into place with a casual gesture, adjusting something beneath it. Paul glimpsed what looked like a thin tube before the veil settled into place. 
\par \'93Is there reason to stay?\'94 the Fremen asked. 
\par \'93We would honor you,\'94 the Duke said.
\par \'93Honor requires that I be elsewhere soon,\'94 the Fremen said. He shot another glance at Idaho, whirled, and strode out past the door guards.
\par \'93If the other Fremen match him, we'll serve each other well,\'94 Leto said.
\par Idaho spoke in a dry voice: \'93He's a fair sample, Sire.\'94 
\par \'93You understand what you're to do, Duncan?\'94 
\par \'93I'm your ambassador to the Fremen, Sire.\'94
\par \'93Much depends on you, Duncan. We're going to need at least five battalions of those people before the Sardaukar descend on us.\'94
\par \'93This is going to take some doing, Sire. The Fremen are a pretty independent bunch.\'94 Idaho hesitated, then: \'93
And, Sire, there's one other thing. One of the mercenaries we knocked over was trying to get this blade from our dead Fremen friend. The mercenary says there's a Harkonnen reward of a million Solaris for anyone who'll bring in a single crysknife.\'94

\par Leto's chin came up in a movement of obvious surprise. \'93Why do they want one of those blades so badly?\'94
\par \'93The knife is ground from a sandworm's tooth; it's the mark of the Fremen, Sire. With it, a blue-eyed man could penetrate any sietch in the land. They'd question me unless I were known. I don't look Fremen. But\'85 \'94 
\par \'93Piter de Vries,\'94 the Duke said.
\par \'93A man of devilish cunning, my Lord,\'94 Hawat said. 
\par Idaho slipped the sheathed knife beneath his tunic. 
\par \'93Guard that knife,\'94 the Duke said.
\par \'93I understand, m'Lord.\'94 He patted the transceiver on his belt kit. \'93I'll report soon as possible. Thufir has my call code. Use battle language.\'94 He saluted, spun about, and hurried after the Fremen.
\par They heard his footsteps drumming down the corridor.
\par A look of understanding passed between Leto and Hawat. They smiled.
\par \'93We've much to do, Sire,\'94 Halleck said. 
\par \'93And I keep you from your work,\'94 Leto said.
\par \'93I have the report on the advance bases,\'94 Hawat said. \'93Shall I give it another time, Sire?\'94 
\par \'93Will it take long?\'94
\par \'93Not for a briefing. It's said among the Fremen that there were more than two hundred of these advance bases built here on Arrakis during the Desert Botanical Testing Station period. All supposedly have been abandoned, but th
ere are reports they were sealed off before being abandoned.\'94 
\par \'93Equipment in them?\'94 the Duke asked. 
\par \'93According to the reports I have from Duncan.\'94 
\par \'93Where are they located?\'94 Halleck asked.
\par \'93The answer to that question,\'94 Hawat said, \'93is invariably: \lquote Liet knows.\rquote  \'93 
\par \'93God knows,\'94 Leto muttered.
\par \'93Perhaps not. Sire,\'94 Hawat said. \'93You heard this Stilgar use the name. Could he have been referring to a real person?\'94 
\par \'93Serving two masters,\'94 Halleck said. \'93It sounds like a religious quotation.\'94 
\par \'93And you should know,\'94 the Duke said. 
\par Halleck smiled.
\par \'93This Judge of the Change,\'94 Leto said, \'93the Imperial ecologist\endash Kynes\'85 Wouldn't he know where those bases are?\'94 
\par \'93Sire,\'94 Hawat cautioned, \'93this Kynes is an Imperial servant.\'94 
\par \'93And he's a long way from the Emperor,\'94 Leto said. \'93I want those bases. They'd be loaded with materials we could salvage and use for repair of our working equipment.\'94
\par \'93Sire!\'94 Hawat said. \'93Those bases are still legally His Majesty's fief.\'94
\par \'93The weather here's savage enough to destroy anything,\'94 the Duke said. \'93We can always blame the weather. Get this Kynes and at least find out if the bases exist.\'94
\par \'93 \lquote Twere dangerous to commandeer them,\'94 Hawat said. \'93Duncan was clear on one thing: those bases or the idea of them hold some deep significance for the Fremen. We might alienate the Fremen if we took those bases.\'94
\par Paul looked at the faces of the men around them, saw the intensity of the way they followed every word. They appeared deeply disturbed by his father's attitude.
\par \'93Listen to him, Father,\'94 Paul said in a low voice. \'93He speaks truth.\'94
\par \'93Sire,\'94 Hawat said, \'93those bases could give us material to repair every piece of equipment left us, yet be beyond reach for strategic reasons. It'd be rash to move without greater knowledge. This Kynes has arbiter authority
 from the Imperium. We mustn't forget that. And the Fremen defer to him.\'94
\par \'93Do it gently, then,\'94 the Duke said. \'93I wish to know only if those bases exist.\'94 
\par \'93As you will, Sire.\'94 Hawat sat back, lowered his eyes.
\par \'93All right, then,\'94 the Duke said. \'93We know what we have ahead of us\endash work. We've been trained for it. We've some experience in it. We know what the rewards are and the alternatives are clear enough. You all have your assignments.\'94
 He looked at Halleck. \'93Gurney, take care of that smuggler situation first.\'94 
\par \'93 \lquote I shall go unto the rebellious that dwell in the dry land,\rquote  \'93 Halleck intoned.
\par \'93Someday I'll catch that man without a quotation and he'll look undressed,\'94 the Duke said.
\par Chuckles echoed around the table, but Paul heard the effort in them.
\par The Duke turned to Hawat. \'93Set up another command post for intelligence and communications on this floor, Thufir. When you have them ready, I'll want to see you.\'94
\par Hawat arose, glanced around the room as though seeking support. He turned away, led the procession out of the room. The others moved hurriedly, scraping their chairs on the floor, balling up in little knots of confusion.
\par It ended up in confusion, Paul thought, staring at the backs of the last men to leave. Always before, Staff had ended on an incisive air. This meeting had just seemed to trickle out, worn down by its own inadequacies, and with an argument to top it off.

\par For the first time, Paul allowed himself to think about the real possibility of defeat\endash not thinking about it out of fear or because of war
nings such as that of the old Reverend Mother, but facing up to it because of his own assessment of the situation.
\par My father is desperate, he thought. Things aren't going well for us at all.
\par And Hawat\endash Paul recalled how the old Mentat had acted during the conference\endash subtle hesitations, signs of unrest. 
\par Hawat was deeply troubled by something.
\par \'93Best you remain here the rest of the night, Son,\'94 the Duke said. \'93It'll be dawn soon, anyway. I'll inform your mother.\'94 He got to his feet, slowly, stiffly. \'93Why don't
 you pull a few of these chairs together and stretch out on them for some rest.\'94 
\par \'93I'm not very tired, sir.\'94 
\par \'93As you will.\'94
\par The Duke folded his hands behind him, began pacing up and down the length of the table.
\par Like a caged animal, Paul thought.
\par \'93Are you going to discuss the traitor possibility with Hawat?\'94 Paul asked.
\par The Duke stopped across from his son, spoke to the dark windows. \'93We've discussed the possibility many times.\'94 
\par \'93The old woman seemed so sure of herself,\'94 Paul said. \'93And the message Mother\endash \'94
\par \'93Precautions have been taken,\'94 the Duke said. He looked around the room, and Paul marked the hunted wildness in his father's eyes. \'93Remain here. There are some things about the command posts I want to discuss with Thufir.\'94
 He turned, strode out of the room, nodding shortly to the door guards.
\par Paul stared at the place where his father had stood. The space had been empty even before the Duke left the room. And he recalled the old woman's warning: \'93\'85 for the father, nothing.\'94
\par 
\par 
\par On that first day when Muad'Dib rode through the streets of Arrakeen with his family, some of the people along the way recalled the legends and the prophecy and they ventured to shout: \'93Mahdi!\'94
 But their shout was more a question than a statement, for as yet they could only hope he wa
s the one foretold as the Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World. Their attention was focused, too, on the mother, because they had heard she was a Bene Gesserit and it was obvious to them that she was like the other Lisan al-Gaib.
\par -from \'93Manual of Muad'Dib\'94 by the Princess Irulan
\par 
\par The Duke found Thufir Hawat alone in the corner room to which a guard directed him. There was the sound of men setting up communications equipment in an adjoining room, but this place was fairly quiet. The Duke glanced aro
und as Hawat arose from a paper-cluttered table. It was a green-walled enclosure with, in addition to the table, three suspensor chairs from which the Harkonnen \'93H\'94 had been hastily removed, leaving an imperfect color patch.
\par \'93The chairs are liberated but quite safe,\'94 Hawat said. \'93Where is Paul, Sire?\'94
\par \'93I left him in the conference room. I'm hoping he'll get some rest without me there to distract him.\'94
\par Hawat nodded, crossed to the door to the adjoining room, closed it, shutting off the noise of static and electronic sparking.
\par \'93Thufir,\'94 Leto said, \'93the Imperial and Harkonnen stockpiles of spice attract my attention.\'94 
\par \'93M'Lord?\'94
\par The Duke pursed his lips. \'93Storehouses are susceptible to destruction.\'94 He raised a hand as Hawat started to speak. \'93Ignore the Empero
r's hoard. He'd secretly enjoy it if the Harkonnens were embarrassed. And can the Baron object if something is destroyed which he cannot openly admit that he has?\'94 
\par Hawat shook his head. \'93We've few men to spare. Sire.\'94 
\par \'93Use some of Idaho's men. And perhaps some of the Fremen would enjoy a trip off planet. A raid on Giedi Prime\endash there are tactical advantages to such a diversion, Thufir.\'94
\par \'93As you say, my Lord.\'94 Hawat turned away, and the Duke saw evidence of nervousness in the old man, thought: Perhaps he suspects I distrust him. He must know I've private reports of traitors. Well\endash best quiet his fears immediately.
\par \'93Thufir,\'94 he said, \'93since you're one of the few I can trust completely, there's another matter bears discussion. We both know how constant a watch we must keep to prevent traitors from infiltrating our forces\'85 but I have two new reports.\'94 

\par Hawat turned, stared at him.
\par And Leto repeated the stories Paul had brought.
\par Instead of bringing on the intense Mentat concentration, the reports only increased Hawat's agitation.
\par Leto studied the old man and, presently, said: \'93You've been holding something back, old friend. I should've suspected when you were so nervous during Staff. What is it that was too hot to dump in front of the full conference?\'94
\par Hawat's sapho-stained lips were pulled into a prim, straight line with tiny wrinkles radiating into them. They maintained their wrinkled stiffness as he said: \'93My Lord, I don't quite know how to broach this.\'94
\par \'93We've suffered many a scar for each other, Thufir,\'94 the Duke said. \'93You know you can broach any subject with me.\'94 
\par Hawat continued to stare at him, thinking: This is how I like him best. This is the man of honor who deserves every bit of my loyalty and service. Why must I hurt him?
\par \'93Well?\'94 Leto demanded.
\par Hawat shrugged. \'93It's a scrap of a note. We took it from a Harkonnen courier. The note was intended for an agent named Pardee. We've good reason to believe Pardee was top man in the Harkonnen underground here. The note\endash 
it's a thing that could have great consequence or no consequence. It's susceptible to various interpretations.\'94 
\par \'93What's the delicate content of this note?\'94
\par \'93Scrap of a note, my Lord. Incomplete. It was on minimic film with the usual destruction capsule attached. We stopped the acid action just short of full erasure, leaving only a fragment. The fragment, however, is extremely suggestive.\'94 
\par \'93Yes?\'94
\par Hawat rubbed at his lips. \'93It says: \lquote \'85 eto will never suspect, and when the blow falls on him from a beloved hand, its source alone should be enough to destroy him.\rquote 
 The note was under the Baron's own seal and I've authenticated the seal.\'94 
\par \'93Your suspicion is obvious,\'94 the Duke said and his voice was suddenly cold.
\par \'93I'd sooner cut off my arms than hurt you,\'94 Hawat said. \'93My Lord, what if\'85\'94
\par \'93The Lady Jessica,\'94 Leto said, and he felt anger consuming him. \'93Couldn't you wring the facts out of this Pardee?\'94 
\par \'93Unfortunately, Pardee no longer was among the living when we intercepted the courier. The courier, I'm certain, did not know what he carried.\'94 
\par \'93I see.\'94
\par Leto shook his head, thinking: What a slimy piece of business. There can't be anything in it. I know my woman. 
\par \'93My Lord, if\endash \'94 
\par \'93No!\'94 the Duke barked. \'93There's a mistake here that\endash \'94 
\par \'93We cannot ignore it, my Lord.\'94
\par \'93She's been with me for sixteen years! There've been countless opportunities for\endash You yourself investigated the school and the woman!\'94 
\par Hawat spoke bitterly: \'93Things have been known to escape me.\'94 
\par \'93It's impossible, I tell you! The Harkonnens want to destroy the Atreides line\endash meaning Paul, too. They've already tried once. Could a woman conspire against her own son?\'94
\par \'93Perhaps she doesn't conspire against her son. And yesterday's attempt could've been a clever sham.\'94 
\par \'93It couldn't have been a sham.\'94
\par \'93Sire, she isn't supposed to know her parentage, but what if she does know? What if she were an orphan, say, orphaned by an Atreides?\'94
\par \'93She'd have moved long before now. Poison in my drink\'85 a stiletto at night. Who has had better opportunity?\'94 
\par \'93The Harkonnens mean to destroy you, my Lord. Their intent is not just to kill. There's a range of fine distinctions in kanly. This could be a work of art among vendettas.\'94
\par The Duke's shoulders slumped. He closed his eyes, looking old and tired. It cannot be, he thought. The woman has opened her heart to me.
\par \'93What better way to destroy me than to sow suspicion of the woman I love?\'94 he asked.
\par \'93An interpretation I've considered,\'94 Hawat said. \'93Still\'85 \'94 
\par The Duke opened his eyes, stared at Hawat, thinking: Let him be suspicious. Suspicion is his trade, not mine. Perhaps if I appear to believe this, that will make another man careless. 
\par \'93What do you suggest?\'94 the Duke whispered.
\par \'93For now, constant surveillance, my Lord. She should be watched at all times. I will see it's done unobtrusively. Idaho would be the ideal choice for the
 job. Perhaps in a week or so we can bring him back. There's a young man we've been training in Idaho's troop who might be ideal to send to the Fremen as a replacement. He's gifted in diplomacy.\'94 
\par \'93Don't jeopardize our foothold with the Fremen.\'94 
\par \'93Of course not, Sire.\'94 
\par \'93And what about Paul?\'94 
\par \'93Perhaps we could alert Dr. Yueh.\'94 
\par Leto turned his back on Hawat. \'93I leave it in your hands.\'94 
\par \'93I shall use discretion, my Lord.\'94
\par At least I can count on that, Leto thought. And he said: \'93I will take a walk. If you need me, I'll be within the perimeter. The guard can\endash \'94
\par \'93My Lord, before you go, I've a filmclip you should read. It's a first-approximation analysis on the Fremen religion. You'll recall you asked me to report on it.\'94 
\par The Duke paused, spoke without turning. \'93Will it not wait?\'94 
\par \'93Of course, my Lord. You asked what they were shouting, though. It was \lquote Mahdi!\rquote  They directed the term at the young master. When they\endash \'94 
\par \'93At Paul?\'94
\par \'93Yes, my Lord. They've a legend here, a prophecy, that a leader will come to them, child of a Bene Gesserit, to lead them to true freedom. It follows the familiar messiah pattern.\'94 
\par \'93They think Paul is this\'85 this\'85 \'94
\par \'93They only hope, my Lord.\'94 Hawat extended a filmclip capsule.
\par The Duke accepted it, thrust it into a pocket. \'93I'll look at it later.\'94 
\par \'93Certainly, my Lord.\'94 
\par \'93Right now, I need time to\'85 think.\'94 
\par \'93Yes, my Lord.\'94
\par The Duke took a deep sighing breath, strode out the door. He turned to his right down the hall, began walking, hands behind his back, paying little attention to where he was. There were corridors and stairs and balconies and halls\'85
 people who saluted and stood aside for him.
\par In time he came back to the conference room, found it dark and Paul asleep on the table with a guard's robe thrown over him and a ditty pack for a pil
low. The Duke walked softly down the length of the room and onto the balcony overlooking the landing field. A guard at the corner of the balcony, recognizing the Duke by the dim reflection of lights from the field, snapped to attention.
\par \'93At ease,\'94 the Duke murmured. He leaned against the cold metal of the balcony rail.
\par A predawn hush had come over the desert basin. He looked up. Straight overhead, the stars were a sequin shawl flung over blue-black. Low on the southern horizon, the night's second moon peered through a thin dust haze\endash 
an unbelieving moon that looked at him with a cynical light.
\par As the Duke watched, the moon dipped beneath the Shield Wall cliffs, frosting them, and in the sudden intensity of darkness, he experienced a chill. He shivered. 
\par Anger shot through him.
\par The Harkonnens have hindered and hounded and hunted me for the last time, he thought. They are dung heaps with village provost minds! Here I make my stand! And he thought with a touch of sadness: I must rule with eye and claw\endash as the hawk
 among lesser birds. Unconsciously, his hand brushed the hawk emblem on his tunic.
\par To the east, the night grew a faggot of luminous gray, then seashell opalescence that dimmed the stars. There came the long, bell-tolling movement of dawn striking across a broken horizon. 
\par It was a scene of such beauty it caught all his attention. 
\par Some things beggar likeness, he thought.
\par He had never imagined anything here could be as beautiful as that shattered red horizon and the purple and ochre cliffs. Beyond the landin
g field where the night's faint dew had touched life into the hurried seeds of Arrakis, he saw great puddles of red blooms and, running through them, an articulate tread of violet\'85 like giant footsteps.
\par \'93It's a beautiful morning. Sire,\'94 the guard said. 
\par \'93Yes, it is.\'94
\par The Duke nodded, thinking: Perhaps this planet could grow on one. Perhaps it could become a good home for my son.
\par Then he saw the human figures moving into the flower fields, sweeping them with strange scythe-like devices\endash dew gatherers. Water so precious, here that even the dew must be collected.
\par And it could be a hideous place, the Duke thought.
\par

\par \'93There is probably no more terrible instant of enlightenment than the one in which you discover your father is a man\endash with human flesh.\'94
\par -from \'93Collected Sayings of Muad'Dib\'94 by the Princess Irulan
\par 
\par The Duke said: \'93Paul, I'm doing a hateful thing, but I must.\'94 He stood beside the portable poison snooper that had been brought into the conference room for their breakfast. The thing's sensor arms hung limp
ly over the table, reminding Paul of some weird insect newly dead.
\par The Duke's attention was directed out the windows at the landing field and its roiling of dust against the morning sky.
\par Paul had a viewer in front of him containing a short filmclip on Fremen religious practices. The clip had been compiled by one of Hawat's experts and Paul found himself disturbed by the references to himself.
\par \'93Mahdi!\'94
\par \'93Lisan al-Gaib!\'94
\par He could close his eyes and recall the shouts of the crowds. So that is what they hope, he
 thought. And he remembered what the old Reverend Mother had said: Kwisatz Haderach. The memories touched his feelings of terrible purpose, shading this strange world with sensations of familiarity that he could not understand. 
\par \'93A hateful thing,\'94 the Duke said. 
\par \'93What do you mean, sir?\'94
\par Leto turned, looked down at his son. \'93Because the Harkonnens think to trick me by making me distrust your mother. They don't know that I'd sooner distrust myself.\'94 
\par \'93I don't understand, sir.\'94
\par Again, Leto looked out the windows. The white sun was well up into its morning quadrant. Milky light picked out a boiling of dust clouds that spilled over into the blind canyons interfingering the Shield Wall.
\par Slowly, speaking in a slow voice to contain his anger, the Duke explained to Paul about the mysterious note. 
\par \'93You might just as well mistrust me,\'94 Paul said.
\par \'93They have to think they've succeeded,\'94 the Duke said. \'93They must think me this much of a fool. It must look real. Even your mother may not know the sham.\'94 
\par \'93But, sir! Why?\'94
\par \'93Your mother's response must not be an act. Oh, she's capable of a supreme act\'85
 but too much rides on this. I hope to smoke out a traitor. It must seem that I've been completely cozened. She must be hurt this way that she does not suffer greater hurt.\'94 
\par \'93Why do you tell me, Father? Maybe I'll give it away.\'94 
\par \'93They'll not watch you in this thing,\'94 the Duke said. \'93You'll keep the secret. You must.\'94 He walked to the windows, spoke without turning. \'93This way, if anything should happen to me, you can tell her the truth\endash 
that I never doubted her, not for the smallest instant. I should want her to know this.\'94
\par Paul recognized the death thoughts in his father's words, spoke quickly: \'93Nothing's going to happen to you, sir. The\endash \'94 
\par \'93Be silent, Son.\'94
\par Paul stared at his father's back, seeing the fatigue in the angle of the neck, in the line of the shoulders, in the slow movements. 
\par \'93You're just tired, Father.\'94
\par \'93I am tired,\'94 the Duke agreed. \'93I'm morally tired. The melancholy degeneration of the Great Houses has afflicted me at last, perhaps. And we were such strong people once.\'94 
\par Paul spoke in quick anger: \'93Our House hasn't degenerated!\'94
\par \'93Hasn't it?\'94
\par The Duke turned, faced his son, revealing dark circles beneath hard eyes, a cynical twist of mouth. \'93I should wed your mother, make her my Duchess. Yet\'85
 my unwedded state gives some Houses hope they may yet ally with me through their marriageable daughters.\'94 He shrugged. \'93So, I\'85 \'94 
\par \'93Mother has explained this to me.\'94
\par \'93Nothing wins more loyalty for a leader than an air of bravura,\'94 the Duke said. \'93I, therefore, cultivate an air of bravura.\'94 
\par \'93You lead well,\'94 Paul protested. \'93You govern well. Men follow you willingly and love you.\'94
\par \'93My propaganda corps is one of the finest,\'94 the Duke said. Again, he turned to stare out at the basin. \'93
There's greater possibility for us here on Arrakis than the Imperium could ever suspect. Yet sometimes I think it'd have been better if we'd run for it, gone renegade. Sometimes I wish we could sink back into anonymity among the people, become less expose
d to\'85 \'94 
\par \'93Father!\'94
\par \'93Yes, I am tired,\'94 the Duke said. \'93Did you know we're using spice residue as raw material and already have our own factory to manufacture filmbase?\'94 
\par \'93Sir?\'94
\par \'93We mustn't run short of filmbase,\'94 the Duke said. \'93Else, how could we flood village and city with our information? The people must learn how well I govern them. How would they know if we didn't tell them?\'94 
\par \'93You should get some rest,\'94 Paul said.
\par Again, the Duke faced his son. \'93Arrakis has another advantage I almost forgot to mention.
 Spice is in everything here. You breathe it and eat it in almost everything. And I find that this imparts a certain natural immunity to some of the most common poisons of the Assassins\rquote 
 Handbook. And the need to watch every drop of water puts all food production\endash yeast culture, hydroponics, chemavit, everything\endash under the strictest surveillance. We cannot kill off large segments of our population with poison\endash 
and we cannot be attacked this way, either. Arrakis makes us moral and ethical.\'94 
\par Paul started to speak, but the Duke cut him off, saying: \'93I have to have someone I can say these things to, Son.\'94 He sighed, glanced back at the dry landscape where even the flowers were gone now\endash 
trampled by the dew gatherers, wilted under the early sun.
\par \'93On Caladan, we ruled with sea and air power,\'94 the Duke said. \'93Here, we must scrabble for desert power. This is your inheritance, Paul. What is to become of you if anything happens to me? You'll not be a renegade House, but a guerrilla House
\endash running, hunted.\'94 
\par Paul groped for words, could find nothing to say. He had never seen his father this despondent.
\par \'93To hold Arrakis,\'94 the Duke said, \'93one is faced with decisions that may cost one his self-respect.\'94 He pointed out the window to the Atreides green and black banner hanging limply from a staff at the edge of the landing field. \'93
That honorable banner could come to mean many evil things.\'94
\par Paul swallowed in a dry throat. His father's words carried futility, a sense of fatalism that left the boy with an empty feeling in his chest.
\par The Duke took an antifatigue tablet from a pocket, gulped it dry. \'93Power and fear,\'94 he said. \'93The tools of statecraft. I must order new emphasis on guerrilla training for you. That filmclip there\endash they call you \lquote Mahdi'\endash 
'Lisan al-Gaib'\endash as a last resort, you might capitalize on that.\'94
\par Paul stared at his father, watching the shoulders straighten as the tablet did its work, but remembering the words of fear and doubt.
\par \'93What's keeping that ecologist?\'94 the Duke muttered. \'93I told Thufir to have him here early.\'94
\par 
\par 
\par My father, the Padishah Emperor, took me by the hand one day and I sensed in the ways my mother had taught me that he was disturbed. He led me down the Hall of Portraits to the ego-likeness of the Duke Leto Atreides. I marked the strong resemblance betwee
n them\endash my father and this man in the portrait\endash both with thin, elegant faces and sharp features dominated by cold eyes. \'93Princess-daughter,\'94 my father said, \'93
I would that you'd been older when it came time for this man to choose a woman.\'94 My father was 71 at
 the time and looking no older than the man in the portrait, and I was but 14, yet I remember deducing in that instant that my father secretly wished the Duke had been his son, and disliked the political necessities that made them enemies.
\par -"In My Father's House\'94 by the Princess Irulan
\par 
\par His first encounter with the people he had been ordered to betray left Dr. Kynes shaken. He prided himself on being a scientist to whom legends were merely interesting clues, pointing toward cultural roots. Yet the boy fitte
d the ancient prophecy so precisely. He had \'93the questing eyes,\'94 and the air of \'93reserved candor.\'94 
\par Of course, the prophecy left certain latitude as to whether the Mother Goddess would bring the Messiah with her or produce Him on the scene. Still, there was this odd correspondence between prediction and persons.
\par They met in midmorning outside the Arrakeen landing field's administration building. An unmarked ornithopter squatted nearby, humming softly on standby like a somnolent insect. An Atreides guard sto
od beside it with bared sword and the faint air-distortion of a shield around him.
\par Kynes sneered at the shield pattern, thinking: Arrakis has a surprise for them there!
\par The planetologist raised a hand, signaled for his Fremen guard to fall back. He strode on ahead toward the building's entrance\endash 
the dark hole in plastic-coated rock. So exposed, that monolithic building, he thought. So much less suitable than a cave.
\par Movement within the entrance caught his attention. He stopped, taking the moment to adjust his robe and the set of his stillsuit at the left shoulder.
\par The entrance doors swung wide. Atreides guards emerged swiftly, all of them heavily armed\endash slow-pellet stunners, swords and shields. Behind them came a tall man, hawk-faced, dark of skin and hair. He
 wore a jubba cloak with Atreides crest at the breast, and wore it in a way that betrayed his unfamiliarity with the garment. It clung to the legs of his stillsuit on one side. It lacked a free-swinging, striding rhythm.
\par Beside the man walked a youth with 
the same dark hair, but rounder in the face. The youth seemed small for the fifteen years Kynes knew him to have. But the young body carried a sense of command, a poised assurance, as though he saw and knew things all around him that were not visible to o
thers. And he wore the same style cloak as his father, yet with casual ease that made one think the boy had always worn such clothing.
\par \'93The Mahdi will be aware of things others cannot see,\'94 went the prophecy.
\par Kynes shook his head, telling himself: They're just people.
\par With the two, garbed like them for the desert, came a man Kynes recognized\endash Gurney Halleck. Kynes took a deep breath to still his resentment against Halleck, who had briefed him on how to behave with the Duke and ducal heir.
\par \'93You may call the Duke \lquote my Lord \lquote  or \lquote Sire.\rquote  \lquote Noble Born\rquote  also is correct, but usually reserved for more formal occasions. The son may be addressed as \lquote young Master\rquote  or \lquote my Lord.\rquote 
 The Duke is a man of much leniency, but brooks little familiarity.\'94 
\par And Kynes thought as he watched the group approach: They'll learn soon enough who's master on Arrakis. Order me questioned half the night by that Mentat, will they? Expect me to guide them on an inspection of spice mining, do they?
\par The import of Hawat's questions had not escaped Kynes. They wanted the Imperial bases. And it was obvious they'd learned of the bases from Idaho.
\par I will have Stilgar send Idaho's head to this Duke, Kynes told himself.
\par The ducal party was only a few paces away now, their feet in desert boots crunching the sand. 
\par Kynes bowed. \'93My Lord, Duke.\'94
\par As he had approached the solitary figure standing near the ornithopter, Leto had studied him: tall, thin, dressed for the desert in loose robe, stillsuit, and low boots. The man's hood was thrown back, its veil hanging t
o one side, revealing long sandy hair, a sparse beard. The eyes were that fathomless blue-within-blue under thick brows. Remains of dark stains smudged his eye sockets. 
\par \'93You're the ecologist,\'94 the Duke said.
\par \'93We prefer the old title here, my Lord,\'94 Kynes said. \'93Planetologist.\'94
\par \'93As you wish,\'94 the Duke said. He glanced down at Paul. \'93Son, this is the Judge of the Change, the arbiter of dispute, the man set here to see that the forms are obeyed in our assumption of power over this fief.\'94 He glanced at Kynes. \'93
And this is my son.\'94 
\par \'93My Lord,\'94 Kynes said.
\par \'93Are you a Fremen?\'94 Paul asked.
\par Kynes smiled. \'93I am accepted in both sietch and village, young Master. But I am in His Majesty's service, the Imperial Planetologist.\'94
\par Paul nodded, impressed by the man's air of strength. Halleck had pointed Kynes out to Paul from an upper window of the administration building: \'93The man standing there with the Fremen escort\endash the one moving now toward the ornithopter.\'94
\par Paul had inspected Kynes briefly with binoculars, noting the prim, straight mouth, the high forehead. Halleck had spoken in Paul's ear: \'93Odd sort of fellow. Has a precise way of speaking\endash clipped off, no fuzzy edges\endash razor-apt.\'94
\par And the Duke, behind them, had said: \'93Scientist type.\'94
\par Now, only a few feet from the man, Paul sensed the power in Kynes, the impact of personality, as though he were blood royal, born to command.
\par \'93I understand we have you to thank for our stillsuits and these cloaks,\'94 the Duke said.
\par \'93I hope they fit well, my Lord,\'94 Kynes said. \'93They're of Fremen make and as near as possible the dimensions given me by your man Halleck here.\'94
\par \'93I was concerned that you said you couldn't take us into the desert unless we wore these garments,\'94 the Duke said. \'93We can carry plenty of water. We don't intend to be out long and we'll have air cover\endash 
the escort you see overhead right now. It isn't likely we'd be forced down.\'94
\par Kynes stared at him, seeing the water-fat flesh. He spoke coldly: \'93You never talk of likelihoods on Arrakis. You speak only of possibilities.\'94
\par Halleck stiffened. \'93The Duke is to be addressed as my Lord or Sire!\'94
\par Leto gave Halleck their private handsignal to desist, said: \'93Our ways are new here, Gurney. We must make allowances.\'94 
\par \'93As you wish, Sire.\'94
\par \'93We are indebted to you, Dr. Kynes,\'94 Leto said. \'93These suits and the consideration for our welfare will be remembered.\'94 
\par On impulse, Paul called to mind a quotation from the O.C. Bible, said: \'93 \lquote The gift is the blessing of the river.\rquote  \'93
\par The words rang out overloud in the still air. The Fremen escort Kynes had left in the shade of the administration building leaped up from their squatting repose, muttering in open agitation. One cried out: \'93Lisan al-Gaib!\'94
\par Kynes whirled, gave a curt, chopping signal with a hand, waved the guard away. They fell back, grumbling among themselves, trailed away around the building. 
\par \'93Most interesting,\'94 Leto said.
\par Kynes passed a hard glare over the Duke and Paul, said: \'93Most of the desert natives here are a superstitious lot. Pay no attention to them. They mean no harm.\'94 But he thought of the words of the legend: \'93
They will greet you with Holy Words and your gifts will be a blessing.\'94
\par Leto's assessment of Kynes\endash based partly on Hawat's brief verbal report (guarded and full of suspicions)\endash suddenly crystallized: the man was Fremen. Kynes ha
d come with a Fremen escort, which could mean simply that the Fremen were testing their new freedom to enter urban areas\endash 
but it had seemed an honor guard. And by his manner, Kynes was a proud man, accustomed to freedom, his tongue and his manner guarded only by his own suspicions. Paul's question had been direct and pertinent. 
\par Kynes had gone native.
\par \'93Shouldn't we be going, Sire?\'94 Halleck asked.
\par The Duke nodded. \'93I'll fly my own \lquote thopter. Kynes can sit up front with me to direct me. You and Paul take the rear seats.\'94 
\par \'93One moment, please,\'94 Kynes said. \'93With your permission, Sire, I must check the security of your suits.\'94
\par The Duke started to speak, but Kynes pressed on: \'93I have concern for my own flesh as well as yours\'85 my Lord. I'm well aware of whose throat would be slit should harm befall you two while you're in my care.\'94
\par The Duke frowned, thinking: How delicate this moment! If I refuse, it may offend him. And this could be a man whose value to me is beyond measure. Yet\'85 to let him inside my shield, touching my person when I know so little about him?
\par The thoughts flicked through his mind with decision hard on their heels. \'93We're in your hands,\'94 the Duke said. He stepped forward, opening his robe, saw Halleck come up on the balls of his feet, poised and alert, but remaining where he was. \'93
And, if you'd be so kind,\'94 the Duke said, \'93I'd appreciate an explanation of the suit from one who lives so intimately with it.\'94
\par \'93Certainly,\'94 Kynes said. He felt up under the robe for the shoulder seals, speaking as he examined the suit. \'93It's basically a micro-sandwich\endash a high-efficiency filter and heat-exchange system.\'94 He adjusted the shoulder seals. \'93
The skin-contact layer's porous. Perspiration passes through it, having cooled the body\'85 near-normal evaporation process. The next two layers\'85 \'94 Kynes tightened the chest fit. \'93\'85
 include heat exchange filaments and salt precipitators. Salt's reclaimed.\'94 
\par The Duke lifted his arms at a gesture, said: \'93Most interesting.\'94 
\par \'93Breathe deeply,\'94 Kynes said. 
\par The Duke obeyed.
\par Kynes studied the underarm seals, adjusted one. \'93Motions of the body, especially breathing,\'94 he said, \'93and some osmotic action provide the pumping force.\'94 He loosened the chest fit slightly. \'93
Reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you draw it through this tube in the clip at your neck.\'94
\par The Duke twisted his chin in and down to look at the end of the tube. \'93Efficient and convenient,\'94 he said. \'93Good engineering.\'94 
\par Kynes knelt, examined the leg seals. \'93Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads,\'94 he said, and stood up, felt the neck fitting, lifted a sectioned flap there. \'93
In the open desert, you wear this filter across your face, this tube in the nostrils with these plugs to insure a tight fit. Breathe in through the mouth filter, out through the nose t
ube. With a Fremen suit in good working order, you won't lose more than a thimbleful of moisture a day\endash even if you're caught in the Great Erg.\'94 
\par \'93A thimbleful a day,\'94 the Duke said.
\par Kynes pressed a finger against the suit's forehead pad, said: \'93This may rub a little. It if irritates you, please tell me. I could slit-patch it a bit tighter.\'94
\par \'93My thanks,\'94 the Duke said. He moved his shoulders in the suit as Kynes stepped back, realizing that it did feel better now\endash tighter and less irritating.
\par Kynes turned to Paul. \'93Now, let's have a look at you, lad.\'94 
\par A good man but he'll have to learn to address us properly, the Duke thought.
\par Paul stood passively as Kynes inspected the suit. It had been an odd sensation putting on the crinkling, slick-surfaced garment. In hi
s foreconsciousness had been the absolute knowledge that he had never before worn a stillsuit. Yet, each motion of adjusting the adhesion tabs under Gurney's inexpert guidance had seemed natural, instinctive. When he had tightened the chest to gain maximu
m pumping action from the motion of breathing, he had known what he did and why. When he had fitted the neck and forehead tabs tightly, he had known it was to prevent friction blisters.
\par Kynes straightened, stepped back with a puzzled expression. \'93You've worn a stillsuit before?\'94 he asked. 
\par \'93This is the first time.\'94 
\par \'93Then someone adjusted it for you?\'94 
\par \'93No.\'94
\par \'93Your desert boots are fitted slip-fashion at the ankles. Who told you to do that?\'94 
\par \'93It\'85 seemed the right way.\'94 
\par \'93That it most certainly is.\'94
\par And Kynes rubbed his cheek, thinking of the legend: \'93He shall know your ways as though born to them.\'94
\par \'93We waste time,\'94 the Duke said. He gestured to the waiting \lquote thopter, led the way, accepting the guard's salute with a nod. He climbed in, fastened his safety harne
ss, checked controls and instruments. The craft creaked as the others clambered aboard.
\par Kynes fastened his harness, focused on the padded comfort of the aircraft\endash soft luxury of gray-green upholstery, gleaming instruments, the sensation of filtered and washed air in his lungs as doors slammed and vent fans whirred alive. 
\par So soft! he thought.
\par \'93All secure, Sire,\'94 Halleck said.
\par Leto fed power to the wings, felt them cup and dip\endash once, twice. They were airborne in ten meters, wings feathered tightly and afterjets thrusting them upward in a steep, hissing climb.
\par \'93Southeast over the Shield Wall,\'94 Kynes said. \'93That's where I told your sandmaster to concentrate his equipment.\'94 
\par \'93Right.\'94
\par The Duke banked into his air cover, the other craft taking up their guard positions as they headed southeast.
\par \'93The design and manufacture of these stillsuits bespeaks a high degree of sophistication,\'94 the Duke said.
\par \'93Someday I may show you a sietch factory,\'94 Kynes said.
\par \'93I would find that interesting,\'94 the Duke said. \'93I note that suits are manufactured also in some of the garrison cities.\'94 
\par \'93Inferior copies,\'94 Kynes said. \'93Any Dune man who values his skin wears a Fremen suit.\'94 
\par \'93And it'll hold your water loss to a thimbleful a day?\'94 
\par \'93Properly suited, your forehead cap tight, all seals in order, your major water loss is through the palms of your hands,\'94 Kynes said. \'93
You can wear suit gloves if you're not using your hands for critical work, but most Fremen in the open desert rub their hands with juice from the leaves of the creosote bush. It inhibits perspiration.\'94 
\par The Duke glanced down to the left at the broken landscape of the Shield Wall\endash chasms of tortured rock, patches of yellow-brown crossed by black lines of fault shattering. It was as though someone had dropped this ground from spac
e and left it where it smashed.
\par They crossed a shallow basin with the clear outline of gray sand spreading across it from a canyon opening to the south. The sand fingers ran out into the basin\endash a dry delta outlined against darker rock.
\par Kynes sat back, think
ing about the water-fat flesh he had felt beneath the stillsuits. They wore shield belts over their robes, slow pellet stunners at the waist, coin-sized emergency transmitters on cords around their necks. Both the Duke and his son carried knives in wrist 
sheathes and the sheathes appeared well worn. The people struck Kynes as a strange combination of softness and armed strength. There was a poise to them totally unlike the Harkonnens.
\par \'93When you report to the Emperor on the change of government here, will you say we observed the rules?\'94 Leto asked. He glanced at Kynes, back to their course.
\par \'93The Harkonnens left; you came,\'94 Kynes said.
\par \'93And is everything as it should be?\'94 Leto asked.
\par Momentary tension showed in the tightening of a muscle along Kynes\rquote  jaw. \'93As Planetologist and Judge of the Change, I am a direct subject of the Imperium\'85 my Lord.\'94 
\par The Duke smiled grimly. \'93But we both know the realities.\'94 
\par \'93I remind you that His Majesty supports my work.\'94 
\par \'93Indeed? And what is your work?\'94
\par In the brief silence, Paul thought: He's pushing this Kynes too hard. Paul glanced at Halleck, but the minstrel-warrior was staring out at the barren landscape.
\par Kynes spoke stiffly: \'93You, of course, refer to my duties as planetologist.\'94 
\par \'93Of course.\'94
\par \'93It is mostly dry land biology and botany\'85 some geological work\endash core drilling and testing. You never really exhaust the possibilities of an entire planet.\'94 
\par \'93Do you also investigate the spice?\'94
\par Kynes turned, and Paul noted the hard line of the man's cheek. \'93A curious question, my Lord.\'94
\par \'93Bear in mind, Kynes, that this is now my fief. My methods differ from those of the Harkonnens. I don't care if you study the spice as long as I share what you discover.\'94 He glanced at the planetologist. \'93
The Harkonnens discouraged investigation of the spice, didn't they?\'94 
\par Kynes stared back without answering.
\par \'93You may speak plainly,\'94 the Duke said, \'93without fear for your skin.\'94
\par \'93The Imperial Court is, indeed, a long way off,\'94 Kynes muttered. And he thought: What does this water-soft invader expect? Does he think me fool enough to enlist with him?
\par The Duke chuckled, keeping his attention on their course. \'93I detect a sour note in your voice, sir. We've waded in here with our mob of tame killers, eh? And we expect you to realize immediately that we're different from the Harkonnens?\'94
\par \'93I've seen the propaganda you've flooded into sietch and village,\'94 Kynes said. \'93 \lquote Love the good Duke!\rquote  Your corps of\endash \'94 
\par \'93Here now!\'94 Halleck barked. He snapped his attention away from the window, leaned forward. 
\par Paul put a hand on Halleck's arm.
\par \'93Gurney!\'94 the Duke said. He glanced back. \'93This man's been long under the Harkonnens.\'94 
\par Halleck sat back. \'93Ayah.\'94
\par \'93Your man Hawat's subtle,\'94 Kynes said, \'93but his object's plain enough.\'94 
\par \'93Will you open those bases to us, then?\'94 the Duke asked. 
\par Kynes spoke curtly: \'93They're His Majesty's property.\'94 
\par \'93They're not being used.\'94 
\par \'93They could be used.\'94 
\par \'93Does His Majesty concur?\'94
\par Kynes darted a hard stare at the Duke. \'93Arrakis could be an Eden if its rulers would look up from grubbing for spice!\'94 
\par He didn't answer my question, the Duke thought. And he said: \'93How is a planet to become an Eden without money?\'94 
\par \'93What is money,\'94 Kynes asked, \'93if it won't buy the services you need?\'94
\par Ah, now! the Duke thought. And he said: \'93We'll discuss this another time. Right now, I believe we're coming to the edge of the Shield Wall. Do I hold the same course?\'94 
\par \'93The same course,\'94 Kynes muttered.
\par Paul looked out his window. Beneath them, the broken ground began to drop away in tumbled creases toward a barren rock pla
in and a knife-edged shelf. Beyond the shelf, fingernail crescents of dunes marched toward the horizon with here and there in the distance a dull smudge, a darker blotch to tell of something not sand. Rock outcroppings, perhaps. In the heat-addled air, Pa
ul couldn't be sure.
\par \'93Are there any plants down there?\'94 Paul asked.
\par \'93Some,\'94 Kynes said. \'93This latitude's life-zone has mostly what we call minor water stealers\endash adapted to raiding each other for moisture, gobbling up the trace-dew. Some parts of the desert t
eem with life. But all of it has learned how to survive under these rigors. If you get caught down there, you imitate that life or you die.\'94
\par \'93You mean steal water from each other?\'94 Paul asked. The idea outraged him, and his voice betrayed his emotion.
\par \'93It's done,\'94 Kynes said, \'93but that wasn't precisely my meaning. You see, my climate demands a special attitude toward water. You are aware of water at all times. You waste nothing that contains moisture.\'94 
\par And the Duke thought: \'93\'85 my climate!\'94
\par \'93Come around two degrees more southerly, my Lord,\'94 Kynes said. \'93There's a blow coming up from the west.\'94 
\par The Duke nodded. He had seen the billowing of tan dust there. He banked the \lquote thopter around, noting the way the escort's wings reflected milky orange from the dust-refracted light as they turned to keep pace with him.
\par \'93This should clear the storm's edge,\'94 Kynes said.
\par \'93That sand must be dangerous if you fly into it,\'94 Paul said. \'93Will it really cut the strongest metals?\'94
\par \'93At this altitude, it's not sand but dust,\'94 Kynes said. \'93The danger is lack of visibility, turbulence, clogged intakes.\'94 
\par \'93We'll see actual spice mining today?\'94 Paul asked. 
\par \'93Very likely,\'94 Kynes said.
\par Paul sat back. He had used the questions and hyperawareness to do what his mother called \'93registering\'94 the person. He had Kynes now\endash 
tune of voice, each detail of face and gesture. An unnatural folding of the left sleeve on the man's robe told of a knife in an arm sheath. The waist bulged strangely. It was said that desert men wore a belted sash into which the
y tucked small necessities. Perhaps the bulges came from such a sash\endash certainly not from a concealed shield belt. A copper pin engraved with the likeness of a hare clasped the neck of Kynes\rquote 
 robe. Another smaller pin with similar likeness hung at the corner of the hood which was thrown back over his shoulders.
\par Halleck twisted in the seat beside Paul, reached back into the rear compartment and brought out his baliset. Kynes looked around as Halleck tuned the instrument, then returned his attention to their course.
\par \'93What would you like to hear, young Master?\'94 Halleck asked. 
\par \'93You choose, Gurney,\'94 Paul said.
\par Halleck bent his ear close to the sounding board, strummed a chord and sang softly:
\par 
\par \'93Our fathers ate manna in the desert, 
\par In the burning places where whirlwinds came. 
\par Lord, save us from that horrible land! 
\par Save us\'85 oh-h-h-h, save us 
\par From the dry and thirsty land.\'94
\par 
\par Kynes glanced at the Duke, said: \'93You do travel with a light complement of guards, my Lord. Are all of them such men of many talents?\'94
\par \'93Gurney?\'94 The Duke chuckled. \'93Gurney's one of a kind. I like him with me for his eyes. His eyes miss very little.\'94 
\par The planetologist frowned.
\par Without missing a beat in his tune, Halleck interposed:
\par 
\par \'93For I am like an owl of the desert, o!
\par  Aiyah! am like an owl of the des-ert!\'94
\par 
\par The Duke reached down, brought up a microphone from the instrument panel, thumbed it to life, said: \'93Leader to Escort Gemma. Flying object at nine o'clock, Sector B. Do you identify it?\'94
\par \'93It's merely a bird,\'94 Kynes said, and added: \'93You have sharp eyes.\'94
\par The panel speaker crackled, then: \'93Escort Gemma. Object examined under full amplification. It's a large bird.\'94 
\par Paul looked in the indicated direction, saw the distant speck: a dot of intermittent motion, and realized how keyed up his father must be. Every sense was at full alert.
\par \'93I'd not realized there were birds that large this far into the desert,\'94 the Duke said.
\par \'93That's likely an eagle,\'94 Kynes said. \'93Many creatures have adapted to this place.\'94
\par The ornithopter swept over a bare rock plain. Paul looked down from their two thousand meters\rquote  altitude, saw the wrinkled shadow of their craft and escort. The land beneath seemed flat, but shadow wrinkles said otherwise.
\par \'93Has anyone ever walked out of the desert?\'94 the Duke asked. 
\par Halleck's music stopped. He leaned forward to catch the answer.
\par \'93Not from the deep desert,\'94 Kynes said. \'93Men have walked out of the second zone several times. They've survived by crossing the rock areas where worms seldom go.\'94
\par The timbre of Kynes\rquote  voice held Paul's attention. He felt his sense come alert the way they were trained to do.
\par \'93Ah-h, the worms,\'94 the Duke said. \'93I must see one sometime.\'94 
\par \'93You may see one today,\'94 Kynes said. \'93Wherever there is spice, there are worms.\'94 
\par \'93Always?\'94 Halleck asked. 
\par \'93Always.\'94
\par \'93Is there relationship between worm and spice?\'94 the Duke asked.
\par Kynes turned and Paul saw the pursed lips as the man spoke. \'93They defend spice sands. Each worm has a\endash territory. As to the spice\'85 who knows? Worm specimens we've examined lead us to suspect complicat
ed chemical interchanges within them. We find traces of hydrochloric acid in the ducts, more complicated acid forms elsewhere. I'll give you my monograph on the subject.\'94
\par \'93And a shield's no defense?\'94 the Duke asked.
\par \'93Shields!\'94 Kynes sneered. \'93Activate a shield within the worm zone and you seal your fate. Worms ignore territory lines, come from far around to attack a shield. No man wearing a shield has ever survived such attack.\'94 
\par \'93How are worms taken, then?\'94
\par \'93High voltage electrical shock applied separately to each ring segment is the only known way of killing and preserving an entire worm,\'94 Kynes said. \'93
They can be stunned and shattered by explosives, but each ring segment has a life of its own. Barring atomics, I know of no explosive powerful enough to destroy a large worm entirely. They're incredibly tough.\'94
\par \'93Why hasn't an effort been made to wipe them out?\'94 Paul asked.
\par \'93Too expensive,\'94 Kynes said. \'93Too much area to cover.\'94 
\par Paul leaned back in his corner. His truthsense, awareness of tone shadings, told him that Kynes was lying and telling half-truths. And he thought: If there's a relationship between spice and worms, killing the worms would destroy the spice.
\par \'93No one will have to walk out of the desert soon,\'94 the Duke said. \'93Trip these little transmitters at our necks and rescue is on its way. All our workers will be wearing them before long. We're setting up a special rescue service.\'94 
\par \'93Very commendable,\'94 Kynes said.
\par \'93Your tone says you don't agree,\'94 the Duke said.
\par \'93Agree? Of course I agree, but it won't 
be much use. Static electricity from sandstorms masks out many signals. Transmitters short out. They've been tried here before, you know. Arrakis is tough on equipment. And if a worm's hunting you there's not much time. Frequently, you have no more than f
ifteen or twenty minutes.\'94 
\par \'93What would you advise?\'94 the Duke asked. 
\par \'93You ask my advice?\'94 
\par \'93As planetologist, yes.\'94 
\par \'93You'd follow my advice?\'94 
\par \'93If I found it sensible.\'94 
\par \'93Very well, my Lord. Never travel alone.\'94 
\par The Duke turned his attention from the controls. \'93That's all?\'94 
\par \'93That's all. Never travel alone.\'94
\par \'93What if you're separated by a storm and forced down?\'94 Halleck asked. \'93Isn't there anything you could do?\'94 
\par \'93Any thing covers much territory,\'94 Kynes said. 
\par \'93What would you do?\'94 Paul asked.
\par Kynes turned a hard stare at the boy, brought his attention back to the Duke. \'93
I'd remember to protect the integrity of my stillsuit. If I were outside the worm zone or in rock, I'd stay with the ship. If I were down in open sand, I'd get away from the ship as fast a
s I could. About a thousand meters would be far enough. Then I'd hide beneath my robe. A worm would get the ship, but it might miss me.\'94 
\par \'93Then what?\'94 Halleck asked.
\par Kynes shrugged. \'93Wait for the worm to leave.\'94 
\par \'93That's all?\'94 Paul asked.
\par \'93When the worm has gone, one may try to walk out,\'94 Kynes said. \'93You must walk softly, avoid drum sands, tidal dust basins\endash head for the nearest rock zone. There are many such zones. You might make it.\'94 
\par \'93Drum sand?\'94 Halleck asked.
\par \'93A condition of sand compaction,\'94 Kynes said. \'93The slightest step sets it drumming. Worms always come to that.\'94 
\par \'93And a tidal dust basin?\'94 the Duke asked.
\par \'93Certain depressions in the desert have filled with dust over the centuries. Some are so vast they have currents and tides. All will swallow the unwary who step into them.\'94
\par Halleck sat back, resumed strumming the baliset. Presently, he sang:
\par 
\par \'93Wild beasts of the desert do hunt there, 
\par Waiting for the innocents to pass.
\par Oh-h-h, tempt not the gods of the desert, 
\par Lest you seek a lonely epitaph.
\par The perils of the\endash \'94
\par 
\par He broke off, leaned forward. \'93Dust cloud ahead, Sire.\'94 
\par \'93I see it, Gurney.\'94 
\par \'93That's what we seek,\'94 Kynes said.
\par Paul stretched up in the seat to peer ahead, saw a rolling yellow cloud low on the desert surface some thirty kilometers ahead.
\par \'93One of your factory crawlers,\'94 Kynes said. \'93It's on the surface and that means it's on spice. The cloud is vented sand being expelled after the spice has been centrifugally removed. There's no other cloud quite like it.\'94 
\par \'93Aircraft over it,\'94 the Duke said.
\par \'93I see two\'85 three\'85 four spotters,\'94 Kynes said. \'93They're watching for wormsign.\'94
\par \'93Wormsign?\'94 the Duke asked.
\par \'93A sandwave moving toward the crawler. They'll have seismic probes on the surface, too. Worms sometimes travel too deep for the wave to show.\'94 Kynes swung his gaze around the sky. \'93Should be a carryall wing around, but I don't see it.\'94 
\par \'93The worm always comes, eh?\'94 Halleck asked. 
\par \'93Always.\'94
\par Paul leaned forward, touched Kynes\rquote  shoulder. \'93How big an area does each worm stake out?\'94 
\par Kynes frowned. The child kept asking adult questions. 
\par \'93That depends on the size of the worm.\'94 
\par \'93What's the variation?\'94 the Duke asked.
\par \'93Big ones may control three or four hundred square kilometers. Small ones\endash \'94 He broke off as the Duke kicked on the jet brakes. The ship b
ucked as its tail pods whispered to silence. Stub wings elongated, cupped the air. The craft became a full \lquote thopter as the Duke banked it, holding the wings to a gentle beat, pointing with his left hand off to the east beyond the factory crawler. 

\par \'93Is that wormsign?\'94 
\par Kynes leaned across the Duke to peer into the distance.
\par Paul and Halleck were crowded together, looking in the same direction, and Paul noted that their escort, caught by the sudden maneuver, had surged ahead, but now was curving back. The factory crawler lay ahead of them, still some three kilometers away.

\par Where the Duke pointed, crescent dune tracks spread shadow ripples toward the horizon and, running through them as a level line stretching into the distance, came an elongated mount-in-motion\endash 
a cresting of sand. It reminded Paul of the way a big fish disturbed the water when swimming just under the surface.
\par \'93Worm,\'94 Kynes said. \'93Big one.\'94 He leaned back, grabbed the microphone from the panel, punched out a new frequency selection. Glancing at the grid chart on rollers over their heads, he spoke into the microphone: \'93
Calling crawler at Delta Ajax niner. Wormsign warning. Crawler at Delta Ajax niner. Wormsign warning. Acknowledge, please.\'94 He waited.
\par The panel speaker emitted static crackles, then a voice: \'93Who calls Delta Ajax niner? Over.\'94 
\par \'93They seem pretty calm about it,\'94 Halleck said.
\par Kynes spoke into the microphone: \'93Unlisted flight\endash north and east of you about three kilometers. Wormsign is on intercept course, your position, estimated contact twenty-five minutes.\'94 
\par Another voice rumbled from the speaker: \'93This is Spotter Control. Sighting confirmed. Stand by for contact fix.\'94 There was a pause, then: \'93Contact in twenty-six minutes minus. That was a sharp estimate. Who's on that unlisted flight? Over.\'94 

\par Halleck had his harness off and surged forward between Kynes and the Duke. \'93Is this the regular working frequency, Kynes?\'94 
\par \'93Yes. Why?\'94 
\par \'93Who'd be listening?\'94 
\par \'93Just the work crews in this area. Cuts down interference.\'94 
\par Again, the speaker crackled, then: \'93This is Delta Ajax niner. Who gets bonus credit for that spot? Over.\'94 
\par Halleck glanced at the Duke.
\par Kynes said: \'93There's a bonus based on spice load for whoever gives first worm warning. They want to know\endash \'94 
\par \'93Tell them who had first sight of that worm,\'94 Halleck said. 
\par The Duke nodded.
\par Kynes hesitated, then lifted the microphone; \'93Spotter credit to the Duke Leto Atreides. The Duke Leto Atreides. Over.\'94 
\par The voice from the speaker was flat and partly distorted by a burst of static: \'93We read and thank you.\'94
\par \'93Now, tell them to divide the bonus among themselves,\'94 Halleck ordered. \'93Tell them it's the Duke's wish.\'94 
\par Kynes took a deep breath, then: \'93It's the Duke's wish that you divide the bonus among your crew. Do you read? Over.\'94 
\par \'93Acknowledged and thank you,\'94 the speaker said.
\par The Duke said: \'93I forgot to mention that Gurney is also very talented in public relations.\'94 
\par Kynes turned a puzzled frown on Halleck.
\par \'93This lets the men know their Duke is concerned for their safety,\'94 Halleck said. \'93Word will get around. It was on an area working frequency\endash not likely Harkonnen agents heard.\'94 He glanced out at their air cover. \'93
And we're a pretty strong force. It was a good risk.\'94
\par The Duke banked their craft toward the sandcloud erupting from the factory crawler. \'93What happens now?\'94
\par \'93There's a carryall wing somewhere close,\'94 Kynes said. \'93It'll come in and lift off the crawler.\'94 
\par \'93What if the carryall's wrecked?\'94 Halleck asked.
\par \'93Some equipment is lost,\'94 Kynes said. \'93Get in close over the crawler, my Lord; you'll find this interesting.\'94
\par The Duke scowled, busied himself with the controls as they came into turbulent air over the crawler.
\par Paul looked down, saw sand still spewing out of the metal and plastic monster beneath them. It looked like a great tan and blue beetle 
with many wide tracks extending on arms around it. He saw a giant inverted funnel snout poked into dark sand in front of it.
\par \'93Rich spice bed by the color,\'94 Kynes said. \'93They'll continue working until the last minute.\'94
\par The Duke fed more power to the wings, stiffened them for a steeper descent as he settled lower in a circling glide above the crawler. A glance left and right showed his cover holding altitude and circling overhead.
\par Paul studied the yellow cloud belching from the crawler's pipe vents, looked out over the desert at the approaching worm track.
\par \'93Shouldn't we be hearing them call in the carryall?\'94 Halleck asked.
\par \'93They usually have the wing on a different frequency,\'94 Kynes said.
\par \'93Shouldn't they have two carryalls standing by for every crawler?\'94 the Duke asked. \'93There should be twenty-six men on that machine down there, not to mention cost of equipment.\'94 
\par Kynes said: \'93You don't have enough ex\endash \'94
\par He broke off as the speaker erupted with an angry voice: \'93Any of you see the wing? He isn't answering.\'94
\par A garble of noise crackled from the speaker, drowned in an abrupt override signal, then silence and the first voice: \'93Report by the numbers! Over.\'94
\par \'93This is Spotter Control. Last I saw, the wing was pretty high and circling off northwest. I don't see him now. Over.\'94 
\par \'93Spotter one: negative. Over.\'94 
\par \'93Spotter two: negative. Over.\'94 
\par \'93Spotter three: negative. Over.\'94 
\par Silence.
\par The Duke looked down. His own craft's shadow was just passing over the crawler. \'93Only four spotters, is that right?\'94 
\par \'93Correct,\'94 Kynes said.
\par \'93There are five in our party,\'94 the Duke said. \'93Our ships are larger. We can crowd in three extra each. Their spotters ought to be able to lift off two each.\'94 
\par Paul did the mental arithmetic, said: \'93That's three short.\'94 
\par \'93Why don't they have two carryalls to each crawler?\'94 barked the Duke.
\par \'93You don't have enough extra equipment,\'94 Kynes said. 
\par \'93All the more reason we should protect what we have!\'94 
\par \'93Where could that carryall go?\'94 Halleck asked.
\par \'93Could've been forced down somewhere out of sight,\'94 Kynes said.
\par The Duke grabbed the microphone, hesitated with thumb poised over its switch. \'93How could they lose sight of a carryall?\'94 
\par \'93They keep their attention on the ground looking for wormsign,\'94 Kynes said.
\par The Duke thumbed the switch, spoke into the microphone. \'93This is your Duke. We are coming down to take off Delta Ajax niner's crew. All spotters are ordered to comply. Spotters will land on the east side. We will take the west. Over.\'94
 He reached down, punched out his own command frequency, repeated the order for his own air cover, handed the microphone back to Kynes.
\par Kynes returned to the working frequency and a voice blasted from the speaker: \'93\'85 almost a full load of spice! We have almost a full load! We can't leave that for a damned worm! Over.\'94 
\par \'93Damn the spice!\'94 the Duke barked. He grabbed back the microphone, said: \'93
We can always get more spice. There are seats in our ships for all but three of you. Draw straws or decide any way you like who's to go. But you're going, and that's an order!\'94 He slammed the microphone back into Kynes\rquote  hands, muttered: \'93
Sorry,\'94 as Kynes shook an injured finger. 
\par \'93How much time?\'94 Paul asked. 
\par \'93Nine minutes,\'94 Kynes said.
\par The Duke said: \'93This ship has more power than the others. If we took off under jet with three-quarter wings, we could crowd in an additional man.\'94 
\par \'93That sand's soft,\'94 Kynes said.
\par \'93With four extra men aboard on a jet takeoff, we could snap the wings, Sire,\'94 Halleck said.
\par \'93Not on this ship,\'94 the Duke said. He hauled back on the controls as the \lquote thopter glided in beside the crawler. The wings tipped up, braked the \lquote thopter to a skidding stop within twenty meters of the factory.
\par The crawler was silent now, no sand spouting from its vents. Only a faint mechanical rumble issued from it, becoming more audible as the Duke opened his door.
\par Immediately, their nostrils were assailed by the odor of cinnamon\endash heavy and pungent.
\par With a loud flapping, the spotter aircraft glided down to the sand on the other side of the crawler. The Duke's own escort swooped in to land in line with him.
\par Paul, looking out at the factory, saw how all the \lquote thopters were dwarfed by it\endash gnats beside a warrior beetle.
\par \'93Gurney, you and Paul toss out that rear seat,\'94 the Duke said. He manually cranked the wings out to three-quarters, set their angle, checked the jet pod controls. \'93Why the devil aren't they coming out of that machine?\'94
\par \'93They're hoping the carryall will show up,\'94 Kynes said. \'93They still have a few minutes.\'94 He glanced off to the east.
\par All turned to look the same direction, seeing no sign of the worm, but there was a heavy, charged feeling of anxiety in the air.
\par The Duke took the microphone, punched for his command frequency, said: \'93Two of you toss out your shield generators. By the numbers. You can carry one more man that way. We're not leaving any men for that monster.\'94
 He keyed back to the working frequency, barked: \'93All right, you in Delta Ajax niner! Out! Now! This is a command from your Duke! On the double or I'll cut that crawler apart with a lasgun!\'94
\par A hatch snapped open near the front of the fa
ctory, another at the rear, another at the top. Men came tumbling out, sliding and scrambling down to the sand. A tall man in a patched working robe was the last to emerge. He jumped down to a track and then to the sand.
\par The Duke hung the microphone on the panel, swung out onto the wing step, shouted: \'93Two men each into your spotters.\'94 
\par The man in the patched robe began lolling off pairs of his crew, pushing them toward the craft waiting on the other side.
\par \'93Four over here!\'94 the Duke shouted. \'93Four into that ship back there!\'94 He jabbed a finger at an escort \lquote thopter directly behind him. The guards were just wrestling the shield generator out of it. \'93And four into that ship over there!
\'94 He pointed to the other escort that had shed its shield generator. \'93Three each into the others! Run, you sand dogs!\'94
\par The tall man finished counting off his crew, came slogging across the sand followed by three of his companions. 
\par \'93I hear the worm, but I can't see it,\'94 Kynes said.
\par The others heard it then\endash an abrasive slithering, distant and growing louder.
\par \'93Damn sloppy way to operate,\'94 the Duke muttered.
\par Aircraft began flapping off the sand around them. It reminded the Duke of a time in his home planet's jungles, a sudden emergence into a clearing, and carrion birds lifting away from the carcass of a wild ox.
\par The spice workers slogged up to the side of the \lquote thopter, started climbing in behind the Duke. Halleck helped, dragging them into the rear.
\par \'93In you go, boys!\'94 he snapped. \'93On the double!\'94
\par Paul, crowded into a corner by sweatin
g men, smelled the perspiration of fear, saw that two of the men had poor neck adjustments on their stillsuits. He filed the information in his memory for future action. His father would have to order tighter stillsuit discipline. Men tended to become slo
ppy if you didn't watch such things.
\par The last man came gasping into the rear, said. \'93The worm! It's almost on us! Blast off!\'94
\par The Duke slid into his seat, frowning, said: \'93We still have almost three minutes on the original contact estimate. Is that right, Kynes?\'94 He shut his door, checked it.
\par \'93Almost exactly, my Lord,\'94 Kynes said, and he thought: A cool one, this duke.
\par \'93All secure here, Sire,\'94 Halleck said.
\par The Duke nodded, watched the last of his escort take off. He adjusted the igniter, glanced once more at wings and instruments, punched the jet sequence.
\par The take-off pressed the Duke and Kynes deep into their seats, compressed the people in the rear. Kynes watched the way the Duke handled the controls\endash gently, surely. The \lquote thopter was fully airborne now, an
d the Duke studied his instruments, glanced left and right at his wings.
\par \'93She's very heavy, Sire,\'94 Halleck said.
\par \'93Well within the tolerances of this ship,\'94 the Duke said. \'93You didn't really think I'd risk this cargo, did you, Gurney?\'94 
\par Halleck grinned, said: \'93Not a bit of it, Sire.\'94
\par The Duke banked his craft in a long easy curve\endash climbing over the crawler.
\par Paul, crushed into a corner beside a window, stared down at the silent machine on the sand. The wormsign had broken off about four hundred meters from the crawler. And now, there appeared to be turbulence in the sand around the factory.
\par \'93The worm is now beneath the crawler,\'94 Kynes said. \'93You are about to witness a thing few have seen.\'94
\par Flecks of dust shadowed the sand around the crawler now. The big machine
 began to tip down to the right. A gigantic sand whirlpool began forming there to the right of the crawler. It moved faster and faster. Sand and dust filled the air now for hundreds of meters around.
\par Then they saw it!
\par A wide hole emerged from the sand. Sun
light flashed from glistening white spokes within it. The hole's diameter was at least twice the length of the crawler, Paul estimated. He watched as the machine slid into that opening in a billow of dust and sand. The hole pulled back.
\par \'93Gods, what a monster!\'94 muttered a man beside Paul. 
\par \'93Got all our floggin\rquote  spice!\'94 growled another.
\par \'93Someone is going to pay for this,\'94 the Duke said. \'93I promise you that.\'94
\par By the very flatness of his father's voice, Paul sensed the deep anger. He found that he shared it. This was criminal waste! 
\par In the silence that followed, they heard Kynes.
\par \'93Bless the Maker and His water,\'94 Kynes murmured. \'93Bless the coming and going of Him. May His passage cleanse the world. May He keep the world for His people.\'94 
\par \'93What's that you're saying?\'94 the Duke asked. 
\par But Kynes remained silent.
\par Paul glanced at the men crowded around him. They were staring fearfully at the back of Kynes\rquote  head. One of them whispered: \'93Liet.\'94 
\par Kynes turned, scowling. The man sank back, abashed.
\par Another of the rescued men began coughing\endash dry and rasping. Presently, he gasped: \'93Curse this hell hole!\'94
\par The tall Dune man who had come last out of the crawler said; \'93Be you still, Coss. You but worsen your cough.\'94 He stirred among the men until he could look through them at the back of the Duke's head. \'93You be the Duke Leto, I warrant,\'94
 he said. \'93It's to you we give thanks for our lives. We were ready to end it there until you came along.\'94 
\par \'93Quiet, man, and let the Duke fly his ship,\'94 Halleck muttered.
\par Paul glanced at Halleck. He, too, had seen the tension wrinkles at the corner of his father's jaw. One walked softly when the Duke was in a rage.
\par Leto began easing his \lquote thopter out of its great banking circle, stopped at a new sign of movement on the sand. The worm had withdrawn in
to the depths and now, near where the crawler had been, two figures could be seen moving north away from the sand depression. They appeared to glide over the surface with hardly a lifting of dust to mark their passage.
\par \'93Who's that down there?\'94 the Duke barked.
\par \'93Two Johnnies who came along for the ride, Soor,\'94 said the tall Dune man.
\par \'93Why wasn't something said about them?\'94 
\par \'93It was the chance they took, Soor,\'94 the Dune man said. 
\par \'93My Lord,\'94 said Kynes, \'93these men know it's of little use to do anything about men trapped on the desert in worm country.\'94 
\par \'93We'll send a ship from base for them!\'94 the Duke snapped.
\par \'93As you wish, my Lord,\'94 Kynes said. \'93But likely when the ship gets here there'll be no one to rescue.\'94 
\par \'93We'll send a ship, anyway,\'94 the Duke said.
\par \'93They were right beside where the worm came up,\'94 Paul said. \'93How'd they escape?\'94
\par \'93The sides of the hole cave in and make the distances deceptive,\'94 Kynes said.
\par \'93You waste fuel here, Sire,\'94 Halleck ventured. 
\par \'93Aye, Gurney.\'94
\par The Duke brought his craft around toward the Shield Wall. His escort came down from circling stations, took up positions above and on both sides.
\par Paul thought about what the Dune man and Kynes had said. He sensed half-truths, outright lies. The men on the sand had glided across the surface so surely, moving in a way obviously calculated to keep from luring the worm back out of its depths.
\par Fremen! Paul thought. Who else would be so sure on the sand? Who else might be left out of your worries as a matter of course\endash because they are in no danger? They know how to live here! They know how to outwit the worm!
\par \'93What were Fremen doing on that crawler?\'94 Paul asked. 
\par Kynes whirled.
\par The tall Dune man turned wide eyes on Paul\endash blue within blue within blue. \'93Who be this lad?\'94 he asked.
\par Halleck moved to place himself between the man and Paul, said: \'93This is Paul Atreides, the ducal heir.\'94
\par \'93Why says he there were Fremen on our rumbler?\'94 the man asked.
\par \'93They fit the description,\'94 Paul said.
\par Kynes snorted. \'93You can't tell Fremen just by looking at them!\'94 He looked at the Dune man. \'93You. Who were those men?\'94 
\par \'93Friends of one of the others,\'94 the Dune man said. \'93Just friends from a village who wanted to see the spice sands.\'94 
\par Kynes turned away. \'93Fremen!\'94
\par But he was remembering the words of the legend: \'93The Lisan al-Gaib shall see through all subterfuge.\'94
\par \'93They be dead now, most likely, young Soor,\'94 the Dune man said. \'93We should not speak unkindly on them.\'94
\par But Paul heard the falsehood in their voices, felt the menace that had brought Halleck instinctively into guarding position.
\par Paul spoke dryly: \'93A terrible place for them to die.\'94
\par Without turning, Kynes said; \'93When God hath ordained a creature to die in a particular place. He causeth that creature's wants to direct him to that place.\'94 
\par Leto turned a hard stare at Kynes.
\par And Kynes, returning the stare, found himself troubled by a fact he had observed here: This Duke was concerned more over the men that he was over the spice. He risked his own life and that of his son to save the men. He passed off the loss of a spice craw
ler with a gesture. The threat to men's lives had him in a rage. A leader such as that would command fanatic loyalty. He would be difficult to defeat.
\par Against his own will and all previous judgments, Kynes admitted to himself: I like this Duke.
\par 
\par 
\par Greatness
 is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must 
have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man.

\par 
\par In the dining hall of the Arrakeen great house, suspensor lamps had been lighted against the early dark. They cast their yellow glows upward onto the black bull's head with its bloody horns, and onto the darkly glistening oil painting of the Old Duke. 

\par Beneath these talismans, white linen shone around the burnished reflections of the Atreides silver, which had been placed in precise arrangements along the great table\endash little archipelagos of service waiting beside crystal gla
sses, each setting squared off before a heavy wooden chair. The classic central chandelier remained unlighted, and its chain twisted upward into shadows where the mechanism of the poison-snooper had been concealed.
\par Pausing in the doorway to inspect the arrangements, the Duke thought about the poison-snooper and what it signified in his society.
\par All of a pattern, he thought. You can plumb us by our language\endash the precise and delicate delineations for ways to administer treacherous death. Will someone try chaumurky tonight\endash poison in the drink? Or will it be chaumas\endash 
poison in the food?
\par He shook his head.
\par Beside each plate on the long table stood a flagon of water. There was enough water along the table, the Duke estimated, to keep a poor Arrakeen family for more than a year.
\par Flanking the doorway in which he stood were broad laving basins of ornate yellow and green tile. Each basin had its rack of towels. It was the custom, the housekeeper had explained, for guests as they entered to dip their hands ceremoniously i
nto a basin, slop several cups of water onto the floor, dry their hands on a towel and fling the towel into the growing puddle at the door. After the dinner, beggars gathered outside to get the water squeezings from the towels.
\par How typical of a Harkonnen fief, the Duke thought. Every degradation of the spirit that can be conceived. He took a deep breath, feeling rage tighten his stomach. 
\par \'93The custom stops here!\'94 he muttered.
\par He saw a serving woman\endash one of the old and gnarled ones the housekeeper had recommended\endash 
hovering at the doorway from the kitchen across from him. The Duke signaled with upraised hand. She moved out of the shadows, scurried around the table toward him, and he noted the leathery face, the blue-within-blue eyes. 
\par \'93My Lord wishes?\'94 She kept her head bowed, eyes shielded. 
\par He gestured. \'93Have these basins and towels removed.\'94 
\par \'93But\'85 Noble Born\'85\'94 She looked up, mouth gaping.
\par \'93I know the custom!\'94 he barked. \'93Take these basins to the front door. While we're eating and until we've finished, each beggar who calls may have a full cup of water. Understood?\'94 
\par Her leathery face displayed a twisting of emotions: dismay, anger\'85
\par With sudden insight, Leto realized that she must have planned to sell the water squeezings from the foot-trampled towels, wringing a few coppers from the wretches who came to the door. Perhaps that also was a custom.
\par His face clouded, and he growled: \'93I'm posting a guard to see that my orders are carried out to the letter.\'94
\par He whirled, strode back down the passage to the Great Hall. Memories rolled in his mind like the toothless mutterings of old women. He remembered open water and waves\endash days of grass instead of sand\endash 
dazed summers that had whipped past him like windstorm leaves. 
\par All gone.
\par I'm getting old, he thought. I've felt the cold hand of my mortality. And in what? An old woman's greed.
\par In the Great Hall, the Lady Jessica was the center of a mixed group standing in front of the fireplace. An open blaze crackled there, casting flickers of orange light onto jewels and laces and cos
tly fabrics. He recognized in the group a stillsuit manufacturer down from Carthag, an electronics equipment importer, a water-shipper whose summer mansion was near his polar-cap factory, a representative of the Guild Bank (lean and remote, that one), a d
ealer in replacement parts for spice mining equipment, a thin and hard-faced woman whose escort service for off-planet visitors reputedly operated as cover for various smuggling, spying, and blackmail operations.
\par Most of the women in the hall seemed cast from a specific type\endash decorative, precisely turned out, an odd mingling of untouchable sensuousness.
\par Even without her position as hostess, Jessica would have dominated the group, he thought. She wore no jewelry and had chosen warm colors\endash a long dress almost the shade of the open blaze, and an earth-brown band around her bronzed hair.
\par He realized she had done this to taunt him subtly, a reproof against his recent pose of coldness. She was well aware that he liked her best in these shades\endash that he saw her as a rustling of warm colors.
\par Nearby, more an outflanker than a member of the group, stood Duncan Idaho in glittering dress uniform, flat face unreadable, the curling black hair neatly combed. He had been summoned back from the Fremen and had his orders from Hawat\endash 
"Under pretext of guarding her, you will keep the Lady Jessica under constant surveillance.\'94 
\par The Duke glanced around the room.
\par There was Paul in the corner surrounded by a fawning group of the younger Arrakeen richece, and, aloof among them, three offic
ers of the House Troop. The Duke took particular note of the young women. What a catch a ducal heir would make. But Paul was treating all equally with an air of reserved nobility.
\par He'll wear the title well, the Duke thought, and realized with a sudden chill that this was another death thought.
\par Paul saw his father in the doorway, avoided his eyes. He looked around at the clusterings of guests, the jeweled hands clutching drinks (and the unobtrusive inspections with tiny remote-cast snoopers). Seeing all the 
chattering faces, Paul was suddenly repelled by them. They were cheap masks locked on festering thoughts\endash voices gabbling to drown out the loud silence in every breast.
\par I'm in a sour mood, he thought, and wondered what Gurney would say to that.
\par He knew his mood's source. He hadn't wanted to attend this function, but his father had been firm. \'93You have a place\endash a position to uphold. You're old enough to do this. You're almost a man.\'94
\par Paul saw his father emerge from the doorway, inspect the room, then cross to the group around the Lady Jessica.
\par As Leto approached Jessica's group, the water-shipper was asking: \'93Is it true the Duke will put in weather control?\'94 
\par From behind the man, the Duke said: \'93We haven't gone that far in our thinking, sir.\'94
\par The man turned, exposing a bland round face, darkly tanned. \'93Ah-h, the Duke,\'94 he said. \'93We missed you.\'94
\par Leto glanced at Jessica. \'93A thing needed doing.\'94 He returned his attention to the water-shipper, explained what he had ordered for the laving basins, adding: \'93As far as I'm concerned, the old custom ends now.\'94 
\par \'93Is this a ducal order, m'Lord?\'94 the man asked.
\par \'93I leave that to your own\'85 ah\'85 conscience,\'94 the Duke said. He turned, noting Kynes come up to the group.
\par One of the women said: \'93I think it's a very generous gesture\endash giving water to the\endash \'94 Someone shushed her.
\par The Duke looked at Kynes, noting that the planetologist wore an old-style dark brown uniform with epaulets of the Imperial Civil Servant and a tiny gold teardrop of rank at his collar.
\par The water-shipper asked in an angry voice: \'93Does the Duke imply criticism of our custom?\'94
\par \'93This custom has been changed,\'94 Leto said. He nodded to Kynes, marked the frown on Jessica's face, thought: A frown does not become her, but it'll increase rumors of friction between us.
\par \'93With the Duke's permission,\'94 the water-shipper said, \'93I'd like to inquire further about customs.\'94
\par Leto heard the sudden oily tone in the man's voice, noted the watchful silence in this group, the way heads were beginning to turn toward them around the room.
\par \'93Isn't it almost time for dinner?\'94 Jessica asked.
\par \'93But our guest has some questions,\'94 Leto said. And he looked at the water-shipper, seeing a round-faced man with large eyes and thick lips, recalling Hawat's memorandum: \'93\'85 and this water-shipper is a man to watch\endash 
Lingar Bewt, remember the name. The Harkonnens used him but never fully controlled him.\'94 
\par \'93Water customs are so interesting,\'94 Bewt said, and there was a smile on his face. \'93I'm curious what you intend about the conservatory attached to this house. Do you intend to continue flaunting it in the people's faces\'85 m'Lord?\'94
\par Leto held anger in check, staring at the man. Thoughts raced through his mind. It had taken bravery to challenge him in his own ducal castle, especially since they now had Bewt's signature o
ver a contract of allegiance. The action had taken, also, a knowledge of personal power. Water was, indeed, power here. If water facilities were mined, for instance, ready to be destroyed at a signal\'85
 The man looked capable of such a thing. Destruction of water facilities might well destroy Arrakis. That could well have been the club this Bewt held over the Harkonnens.
\par \'93My Lord, the Duke, and I have other plans for our conservatory,\'94 Jessica said. She smiled at Leto. \'93We intend to keep it, certainly, but on
ly to hold it in trust for the people of Arrakis. It is our dream that someday the climate of Arrakis may be changed sufficiently to grow such plants anywhere in the open.\'94 
\par Bless her! Leto thought. Let our water-shipper chew on that.
\par \'93Your interest in water and weather control is obvious,\'94 the Duke said. \'93I'd advise you to diversify your holdings. One day, water will not be a precious commodity on Arrakis.\'94 
\par And he thought: Hawat must redouble his efforts at infiltrating this Bewt's organization. And we must start on stand-by water facilities at once. No man is going to hold a club over my head!
\par Bewt nodded, the smile still on his face. \'93A commendable dream, my Lord.\'94 He withdrew a pace.
\par Leto's attention was caught by the expression on Kynes\rquote  face. The man was staring at Jessica. He appeared transfigured\endash like a man in love\'85 or caught in a religious trance.
\par Kynes\rquote  thoughts were overwhelmed at last by the words of prophecy: \'93And they shall share your most precious dream. \'93He spoke directly to Jessica: \'93Do you bring the shortening of the way?\'94
\par \'93Ah, Dr. Kynes,\'94 the water-shipper said. \'93You've come in from tramping around with your mobs of Fremen. How gracious of you.\'94
\par Kynes passed an unreadable glance across Bewt, said: \'93It is said in the desert that possession of water in great amount can inflict a man with fatal carelessness.\'94
\par \'93They have many strange sayings in the desert,\'94 Bewt said, but his voice betrayed uneasiness.
\par Jessica crossed to Leto, slipped her hand under his arm to gain a moment in which to calm herself. Kynes had said: \'93\'85 the shortening of the way.\'94 In the old tongue, the phrase translated as \'93Kwisatz Haderach.\'94
 The planetologist's odd question seemed to have gone unnoticed by the others, and now Kynes was bending over one of the consort women, listening to a low-voiced coquetry.
\par Kwisatz Haderach, Jessica thought. Did our Missionaria Protectiva plant that legend here, too? The thought fanned her secret hope for Paul. He could be the Kwisatz Haderach. He could be.
\par The Guild Bank representative had fallen into conversation with the water-shipper, and Bewt's voice lifted above the renewed hum of conversations: \'93Many people have sought to change Arrakis.\'94 
\par The Duke saw how the words seemed to pierce Kynes, jerking the planetologist upright and away from the flirting woman.
\par Into the sudden silence, a house trooper in uniform of a footman cleared his throat behind Leto, said: \'93Dinner is served, my Lord.\'94 
\par The Duke directed a questioning glance down at Jessica.
\par \'93The custom here is for host and hostess to follow their guests to table,\'94 She said, and smiled; \'93Shall we change that one, too, my Lord?\'94
\par He spoke coldly: \'93That seems a goodly custom. We shall let it stand for now.\'94
\par The illusion that I suspect her of treachery must be maintained, he thought. He glanced at the guests filing past them. Who among you believes this lie?
\par Jessica, sensing his remoteness, wondered at it as she had done frequently the past week. He acts like a man struggling with himself, she thought. Is it because I moved so swiftly setting up 
this dinner party? Yet, he knows how important it is that we begin to mix our officers and men with the locals on a social plane. We are father and mother surrogate to them all. Nothing impresses that fact more firmly than this sort of social sharing.

\par Leto, watching the guests file past, recalled what Thufir Hawat had said when informed of the affair: \'93Sire! I forbid it!\'94 
\par A grim smile touched the Duke's mouth. What a scene that had been. And when the Duke had remained adamant about attending the dinner. Hawat had shaken his head. \'93I have bad feelings about this, my Lord,\'94 he'd said. \'93
Things move too swiftly on Arrakis. That's not like the Harkonnens. Not like them at all.\'94 
\par Paul passed his father escorting a young woman half a head taller than himself. He shot a sour glance at his father, nodded at something the young woman said.
\par \'93Her father manufactures stillsuits,\'94 Jessica said. \'93I'm told that only a fool would be caught in the deep desert wearing one of the man's suits.\'94
\par \'93Who's the man with the scarred face ahead of Paul?\'94 the Duke asked. \'93I don't place him.\'94
\par \'93A late addition to the list,\'94 she whispered. \'93Gurney arranged the invitation. Smuggler.\'94 
\par \'93Gurney arranged?\'94
\par \'93At my request. It was cleared with Hawat, although I thought Hawat was a little stiff about it. The smuggler's called Tuek, Esmar Tuek. He's a power among his kind. They all know him here. He's dined at many of the houses.\'94 
\par \'93Why is he here?\'94
\par \'93Everyone here will ask that question,\'94 she said. \'93Tuek will sow doubt and suspicion just by his presence. He'll also serve notice that you're prepared to back up your orders against graft\endash by enforcement from the smugglers\rquote 
 end as well. This was the point Hawat appeared to like.\'94
\par \'93I'm not sure I like it.\'94 He nodded to a passing couple, saw only a few of their guests remained to precede them. \'93Why didn't you invite some Fremen?\'94 
\par \'93There's Kynes,\'94 she said.
\par \'93Yes, there's Kynes,\'94 he said. \'93Have you arranged any other little surprises for me?\'94 He led her into step behind the procession. 
\par \'93All else is most conventional,\'94 she said.
\par And she thought: My darling, can't you see that this smuggler controls fast ships, that he can be bribed? We must have a way out, a door of escape from Arrakis if all else fails us here.
\par As they emerged into the dining hall, she disenga
ged her arm, allowed Leto to seat her. He strode to his end of the table. A footman held his chair for him. The others settled with a swishing of fabrics, a scraping of chairs, but the Duke remained standing. He gave a hand signal, and the house troopers 
in footman uniform around the table stepped back, standing at attention. 
\par Uneasy silence settled over the room.
\par Jessica, looking down the length of the table, saw a faint trembling at the corners of Leto's mouth, noted the dark flush of anger on his cheeks. What has angered him? she asked herself. Surely not my invitation to the smuggler.
\par \'93Some question my changing of the laving basin custom,\'94 Leto said. \'93This is my way of telling you that many things will change.\'94 
\par Embarrassed silence settled over the table. 
\par They think him drunk, Jessica thought.
\par Leto lifted his water flagon, held it aloft where the suspensor, lights shot beams of reflection off it. \'93As a Chevalier of the Imperium, then,\'94 he said, \'93I give you a toast.\'94
\par The others grasped their flagons, all eyes focused on the Duke. In the sudden stillness, a suspensor light drifted slightly in an errant breeze from the serving kitchen hallway. Shadows played across the Duke's hawk features.
\par \'93Here I am and here I remain!\'94 he barked.
\par There was an abortive movement of flagons toward mouths\endash stopped as the Duke remained with arm upraised. \'93My toast is one of those maxims so dear to our hearts: \lquote Business makes progress! Fortune passes everywhere!\rquote  \'93 
\par He sipped his water.
\par The others joined him. Questioning glances passed among them. 
\par \'93Gurney!\'94 the Duke called.
\par From an alcove at Leto's end of the room came Halleck's voice. \'93Here, my Lord.\'94 
\par \'93Give us a tune, Gurney.\'94
\par A minor chord from the baliset floated out of the alcove. Servants began putting plates of food on the table at the Duke's gesture releasing them\endash 
roast desert hare in sauce cepeda, aplomage sirian, chukka under glass, coffee with melange (a rich cinnamon odor from the spice wafted across the table), a true pot-a-oie served with sparkling Caladan wine.
\par Still, the Duke remained standing.
\par As the guests waited, their attention torn between the dishes placed before them and the standing Duke, Leto said: \'93In olden times, it was the duty of the host to entertain his guests with his own talents.\'94 His knuckles turned
 white, so fiercely did he grip his water flagon. \'93I cannot sing, but I give you the words of Gurney's song. Consider it another toast\endash a toast to all who've died bringing us to this station.\'94 
\par An uncomfortable stirring sounded around the table.
\par Jessica lowered her gaze, glanced at the people seated nearest her\endash 
there was the round-faced water-shipper and his woman, the pale and austere Guild Bank representative (he seemed a whistle-faced scarecrow with his eyes fixed on Leto), the rugged and scar-faced Tuck, his blue-within-blue eyes downcast.
\par \'93Review, friends\endash troops long past review,\'94 the Duke intoned. \'93All to fate a weight of pains and dollars. Their spirits wear our silver collars. Review, friends\endash troops long past review: Each a dot of time without pretens
e or guile. With them passes the lure of fortune. Review, friends\endash troops long past review. When our time ends on its rictus smile, we'll pass the lure of fortune.\'94 
\par The Duke allowed his voice to trail off on the last line, took a deep drink from his water flagon, slammed it back onto the table. Water slopped over the brim onto the linen. 
\par The others drank in embarrassed silence.
\par Again, the Duke lifted his water flagon, and this time emptied its remaining half onto the floor, knowing that the others around the table must do the same.
\par Jessica was first to follow his example.
\par There was a frozen moment before the others began emptying their flagons. Jessica saw how Paul, seated near his father, was studying the reactions around him. She found herself also fascinated by what her guests\rquote  actions revealed\endash 
especially among the women. This was clean, potable water, not something already cast away in a sopping towel. Reluctance to just discard it exposed itself in trembling hands, delayed reactions\rquote  nervous laughter\'85 a
nd violent obedience to the necessity. One woman dropped her flagon, looked the other way as her male companion recovered it.
\par Kynes, though, caught her attention most sharply. The planetotogist hesitated, then emptied his flagon into a container beneath hi
s jacket. He smiled at Jessica as he caught her watching him, raised the empty flagon to her in a silent toast. He appeared completely unembarrassed by his action.
\par Halleck's music still wafted over the room, but it had come out of its minor key, lilting and lively now as though he were trying to lift the mood.
\par \'93Let the dinner commence,\'94 the Duke said, and sank into his chair.
\par He's angry and uncertain, Jessica thought. The loss of that factory crawler hit him more deeply than it should have. It must be somet
hing more than that loss. He acts like a desperate man. She lifted her fork, hoping in the motion to hide her own sudden bitterness. Why not? He is desperate.
\par Slowly at first, then with increasing animation, the dinner got under way. The stillsuit manufacturer complimented Jessica on her chef and wine.
\par \'93We brought both from Caladan,\'94 she said.
\par \'93Superb!\'94 he said, tasting the chukka. \'93Simply superb! And not a hint of melange in it. One gets so tired of the spice in everything.\'94 
\par The Guild Bank representative looked across at Kynes. \'93I understand, Doctor Kynes, that another factory crawler has been lost to a worm.\'94 
\par \'93News\rquote  travels fast,\'94 the Duke said.
\par \'93Then it's true?\'94 the banker asked, shifting his attention to Leto.
\par \'93Of course, it's true!\'94 the Duke snapped. \'93The blasted carry-all disappeared. It shouldn't be possible for anything that big to disappear!\'94
\par \'93When the worm came, there was nothing to recover the crawler,\'94 Kynes said.
\par \'93It should not be possible!\'94 the Duke repeated. 
\par \'93No one saw the carryall leave?\'94 the banker asked.
\par \'93Spotters customarily keep their eyes on the sand,\'94 Kynes said. \'93They're primarily interested in wormsign. A carryall's complement usually is four men\endash two pilots and two journeymen attachers. If one\endash 
or even two of this crew were in the pay of the Duke's foes\endash \'94
\par \'93Ah-h-h, I see,\'94 the banker said. \'93And you, as Judge of the Change, do you challenge this?\'94
\par \'93I shall have to consider my position carefully,\'94 Kynes said, \'93and I certainly will not discuss it at table.\'94 And he thought: That pale skeleton of a man! He knows this is the kind of infraction I was instructed to ignore.
\par The banker smiled, returned his attention to his food.
\par Jessica sat remembering a lecture from her Bene Gesserit school days. The subject had been espionage and counter-espionage. A plump, happy-faced Reverend Mother had been the lecturer, her jolly voice contrasting weirdly with the subject matter.
\par A thing to note about any espionage and/or counter-espionage school is the similar basic reaction pattern of all its graduates. Any enclosed discipline sets its stamp, its pattern, upon its students. That pattern is susceptible to analysis and prediction.

\par \'93Now, motivational patterns are going to be similar among all espionage agents. That is to say: there will be certain types of mo
tivation that are similar despite differing schools or opposed aims. You will study first how to separate this element for your analysis\endash 
in the beginning, through interrogation patterns that betray the inner orientation of the interrogators; secondly, by c
lose observation of language-thought orientation of those under analysis. You will find it fairly simple to determine the root languages of your subjects, of course, both through voice inflection and speech pattern.\'94
\par Now, sitting at table with her son and her Duke and their guests, hearing that Guild Bank representative, Jessica felt a chill of realization: the man was a Harkonnen agent. He had the Giedi Prime speech pattern\endash 
subtly masked, but exposed to her trained awareness as though he had announced himself.
\par Does this mean the Guild itself has taken sides against House Atreides? she asked herself. The thought shocked her, and she masked her emotion by calling for a new dish, all the while listening for the man to betray his purpose. He will shift the conv
ersation next to something seemingly innocent, but with ominous overtones, she told herself. It's his pattern.
\par The banker swallowed, took a sip of wine, smiled at something said to him by the woman on his right. He seemed to listen for a moment to a man down the table who was explaining to the Duke that native Arrakeen plants had no thorns.
\par \'93I enjoy watching the flights of birds on Arrakis,\'94 the banker said, directing his words at Jessica. \'93All of our birds, of course, are carrion-eaters, and many exist without water, having become blood-drinkers.\'94
\par The stillsuit manufacturer's daughter, seated between Paul and his father at the other end of the table, twisted her pretty face into a frown, said: \'93Oh, Soo-Soo, you say the most disgusting things.\'94 
\par The banker smiled. \'93They call me Soo-Soo because I'm financial adviser to the Water Peddlers Union.\'94 And, as Jessica continued to look at him without comment, he added: \'93Because of the water-sellers\rquote  cry\endash 'Soo-Soo Sook!\rquote  \'93
 And he imitated the call with such accuracy that many around the table laughed.
\par Jessica heard the boastful tone of voice, but noted most that the young woman had spoken on cue\endash a set piece. She had produced the excuse for the banker to say what he had said. She glanced at Lingar Bewt. The water magnate
 was scowling, concentrating on his dinner. It came to Jessica that the banker had said: \'93I, too, control that ultimate source of power on Arrakis\endash water.\'94 
\par Paul had marked the falseness in his dinner companion's voice, saw that his mother was following the conversation with Bene Gesserit intensity. On impulse, he decided to play the foil, draw the exchange out. He addressed himself to the banker. 
\par \'93Do you mean, sir, that these birds are cannibals?\'94 
\par \'93That's an odd question, young Master,\'94 the banker said. \'93I merely said the birds drink blood. It doesn't have to be the blood of their own kind, does it?\'94
\par \'93It was not an odd question,\'94 Paul said, and Jessica noted the brittle riposte quality of her training exposed in his voice. \'93Most educated people know that the worst potential competition for any young organism can come from its own kind.\'94
 He deliberately forked a bite of food from his companion's plate, ate it. \'93They are eating from the same bowl. They have the same basic requirements.\'94 
\par The banker stiffened, scowled at the Duke.
\par \'93Do not make the error of considering my son a child,\'94 the Duke said. And he smiled.
\par Jessica glanced around the table, noted that Bewt had brightened, that both Kynes and the smuggler, Tuek, were grinning.
\par \'93It's a rule of ecology,\'94 Kynes said, \'93that the young Master appears to understand quite well. The struggle between life elements is the struggle for the free energy of a system. Blood's an efficient energy source.\'94
\par The banker put down his fork, spoke in an angry voice: \'93It's said that the Fremen scum drink the blood of their dead.\'94 
\par Kynes shook his head, spoke in a lecturing tone: \'93Not the blood, sir. But all of a man's water, ultimately, belongs to his people\endash to his tribe. It's a necessity when you live near the Great Flat. All wate
r's precious there, and the human body is composed of some seventy per cent water by weight. A dead man, surely, no longer requires that water.\'94
\par The banker put both hands against the table beside his plate, and Jessica thought he was going to push himself back, leave in a rage.
\par Kynes looked at Jessica. \'93Forgive me, my Lady, for elaborating on such an ugly subject at table, but you were being told falsehood and it needed clarifying.\'94
\par \'93You've associated so long with Fremen that you've lost all sensibilities,\'94 the banker rasped.
\par Kynes looked at him calmly, studied the pale, trembling face. \'93Are you challenging me, sir?\'94
\par The banker froze. He swallowed, spoke stiffly: \'93Of course not. I'd not so insult our host and hostess.\'94
\par Jessica heard the fear in the man's voice, saw it in his face, in his breathing, in the pulse of a vein at his temple. The man was terrified of Kynes!
\par \'93Our host and hostess are quite capable of deciding for themselves when they've been insulted,\'94 Kynes said. \'93They're brave people who understand defense of honor. We all may attest to their courage by the fact that they are here\'85 now\'85
 on Arrakis.\'94
\par Jessica saw that Leto was enjoying this. Most of the others were not. People all around the table sat poised for flight, hands out of sight under the ta
ble. Two notable exceptions were Bewt, who was openly smiling at the banker's discomfiture, and the smuggler, Tuek, who appeared to be watching Kynes for a cue. Jessica saw that Paul was looking at Kynes in admiration. 
\par \'93Well?\'94 Kynes said.
\par \'93I meant no offense,\'94 the banker muttered. \'93If offense was taken, please accept my apologies.\'94
\par \'93Freely given, freely accepted,\'94 Kynes said. He smiled at Jessica, resumed eating as though nothing had happened.
\par Jessica saw that the smuggler, too, had relaxed. She marked this: the man had shown every aspect of an aide ready to leap to Kynes\rquote  assistance. There existed an accord of some sort between Kynes and Tuek.
\par Leto toyed with a fork, looked speculatively at Kynes. The Geologist's manner indicated a change in attitude toward the House of Atreides. Kynes had seemed colder on their trip over the desert.
\par Jessica signaled for another course of food and drink. Servants appeared with langues de lapins de garenne\endash red wine and a sauce of mushroom-yeast on the side.
\par Slowly, the dinne
r conversation resumed, but Jessica heard the agitation in it, the brittle quality, saw that the banker ate in sullen silence. Kynes would have killed him without hesitating, she thought. And she realized that there was an offhand attitude toward killing 
in Kynes\rquote  manner. He was a casual killer, and she guessed that this was a Fremen quality.
\par Jessica turned to the stillsuit manufacturer on her left, said: \'93I find myself continually amazed by the importance of water on Arrakis.\'94
\par \'93Very important,\'94 he agreed. \'93What is this dish? It's delicious.\'94
\par \'93Tongues of wild rabbit in a special sauce,\'94 she said. \'93A very old recipe.\'94 
\par \'93I must have that recipe,\'94 the man said. 
\par She nodded. \'93I'll see that you get it.\'94
\par Kynes looked at Jessica, said: \'93The newcomer to Arrakis frequently underestimates the importance of water here. You are dealing, you see, with the Law of the Minimum.\'94 
\par She heard the testing quality in his voice, said, \'93Growth is limited by that necessity which is present in the least amount. And, naturally, the least favorable condition controls the growth rate.\'94 
\par \'93It's rare to find members of a Great House aware of planetological problems,\'94 Kynes said. \'93Water is the least favorable condition for life on Arrakis. And remember that growth itself can produce unfavora
ble conditions unless treated with extreme care.\'94
\par Jessica sensed a hidden message in Kynes\rquote  words, but knew she was missing it. \'93Growth,\'94 she said. \'93Do you mean Arrakis can have an orderly cycle of water to sustain human life under more favorable conditions?\'94 
\par \'93Impossible!\'94 the water magnate barked. 
\par Jessica turned her attention to Bewt. \'93Impossible?\'94 
\par \'93Impossible on Arrakis,\'94 he said. \'93Don't listen to this dreamer. All the laboratory evidence is against him.\'94
\par Kynes looked at Bewt, and Jessica noted that the other conversations around the table had stopped while people concentrated on this new interchange.
\par \'93Laboratory evidence tends to blind us to a very simple fact,\'94 Kynes said. \'93That fact is this: we are dealing here with matters that originated and exist out-of-doors where plants and animals carry on their normal existence.\'94 
\par \'93Normal!\'94 Bewt snorted. \'93Nothing about Arrakis is normal!\'94 
\par \'93Quite the contrary,\'94 Kynes said. \'93Certain harmonies could be set up here along self-sustaining lines. You merely have to understand the limits of the planet and the pressures upon it.\'94 
\par \'93It'll never be done,\'94 Bewt said.
\par The Duke came to a sudden realization, placing the point where Kynes\rquote  attitude had changed\endash it had been when Jessica had spoken of holding the conservatory plants in trust for Arrakis.
\par \'93What would it take to set up the self-sustaining system, Doctor Kynes?\'94 Leto asked.
\par \'93If we can get three per cent of the green plant element on Arrakis involved in forming carbon compounds as foodstuffs, we've started the cyclic system,\'94 Kynes said.
\par \'93Water's the only problem?\'94 the Duke asked. He sensed Kynes\rquote  excitement, felt himself caught up in it.
\par \'93Water overshadows the other problems,\'94 Kynes said. \'93This planet has much oxygen without its usual concomitants\endash widespread plant lif
e and large sources of free carbon dioxide from such phenomena as volcanoes. There are unusual chemical interchanges over large surf ace areas here.\'94 
\par \'93Do you have pilot projects?\'94 the Duke asked.
\par \'93We've had a long time in which to build up the Tansley Effect\endash small-unit experiments on an amateur basis from which my science may now draw its working facts.\'94 Kynes said.
\par \'93There isn't enough water,\'94 Bewt said. \'93There just isn't enough water.\'94
\par \'93Master Bewt is an expert on water,\'94 Kynes said. He smiled, turned back to his dinner.
\par The Duke gestured sharply down with his right hand, barked: \'93No! I want an answer! Is there enough water, Doctor Kynes?\'94 
\par Kynes stared at his plate.
\par Jessica watched the play of emotion on his face. He masks himself well, she thought, but she had him registered now and read that he regretted his words.
\par \'93Is there enough water?\'94 the Duke demanded. 
\par \'93There\'85 maybe,\'94 Kynes said. 
\par He's faking uncertainty! Jessica thought.
\par With his deeper truthsense, Paul caught the underlying motive, had to use every ounce of his training to mask his excitement. There is enough water! But Kynes doesn't wish it to be known.
\par \'93Our planetologist has many interesting dreams,\'94 Bewt said. \'93He dreams with the Fremen\endash of prophecies and messiahs.\'94 
\par Chuckles sounded at odd places around the table Jessica marked them\endash the smuggler, the stillsuit manufacturer's daughter, Duncan Idaho, the woman with the mysterious escort service.
\par Tensions are oddly distributed here tonight, Jessica thought. There's too much going on of which I'm not aware. I'll have to develop new information sources.
\par The Duke passed his gaze from Kynes to Bewt to Jessica. He felt oddly let down, as though something vital had passed him here. \'93May be,\'94 he muttered.
\par Kynes spoke quickly: \'93Perhaps we should discuss this another time, my Lord. There are so many\endash \'94
\par The planetologist broke off as an uniformed Atreides trooper hurried in through the service door, was passed by the guard and rushed to the Duke's side. The man bent, whispering into Leto's ear.
\par Jessica recognized the capsign of Hawat's corps, fought down uneasiness. She addressed herself to the stillsuit manufacturer's feminine companion\endash a tiny, dark-haired woman with a doll face, a touch of epicanthic fold to the eyes.
\par \'93You've hardly touched your dinner, my dear,\'94 Jessica said. \'93May I order you something?\'94
\par The woman looked at the stillsuit manufacturer before answering, then: \'93I'm not very hungry.\'94
\par Abruptly, the Duke stood up beside his trooper, spoke in a harsh tone of command: \'93Stay seated, everyone. You will have to forgive me, but a matter has arisen that requires my personal attention.\'94 He stepped aside. \'93
Paul, take over as host for me, if you please.\'94 
\par Paul stood, wanting to ask why his father had to leave, knowing he had to play this with the grand manner. He moved around to his father's chair, sat down in it.
\par The Duke turned to the alcove where Halleck sat, said: \'93Gurney, please take Paul's place at table. We mustn't have an odd number here. When the dinner's over, I may want you to bring Paul to the field C.P. Wait for my call.\'94
\par Halleck emerged from the alcove in dress uniform, his lumpy ugliness seeming out of place in the glittering finery. He leaned his baliset against the wall, crossed to the chair Paul had occupied, sat down.
\par \'93There's no need for alarm,\'94 the Duke said, \'93but I must ask that no one leave until our house guard says it's safe. You will be perfectly secure as long as you remain here, and we'll have this little trouble cleared up very shortly.\'94
\par Paul caught the code words in his father's message\endash guard-safe-secure-shortly. The problem was security, not violence. He saw that his mother had read the same message. They both relaxed.
\par The Duke gave a short nod, wheeled and strode through the service door followed by his trooper.
\par Paul said: \'93Please go on with your dinner. I believe Doctor Kynes was discussing water.\'94 
\par \'93May we discuss it another time?\'94 Kynes asked. 
\par \'93By all means,\'94 Paul said.
\par And Jessica noted with pride her son's dignity, the mature sense of assurance.
\par The banker picked up his water flagon, gestured with it at Bewt. \'93
None of us here can surpass Master Lingar Bewt in flowery phrases. One might almost assume he aspired to Great House status. Come, Master Bewt, lead us in a toast. Perhaps you've a dollop of wisdom for the boy who must be treated like a man.\'94 
\par Jessica clenched her right hand into a fist beneath the table. She saw a handsignal pass from Halleck to Idaho, saw the house troopers along the walls move into positions of maximum guard. 
\par Bewt cast a venomous glare at the banker.
\par Paul glanced at Halleck, took in the defensive positions of his guards, looked at the banker until the man lowered the water flagon. He said: \'93Once, on Caladan, I saw the body of a drowned fisherman recovered. He\endash \'94
\par \'93Drowned?\'94 It was the stillsuit manufacturer's daughter.
\par Paul hesitated, then: \'93Yes. Immersed in water until dead. Drowned.\'94 
\par \'93What an interesting way to die,\'94 she murmured.
\par Paul's smile became brittle. He returned his attention to the banker. \'93The interesting thing about this man was the wounds on his shoulders\endash made by another fisherman's claw-boots. This fisherman was one of several in a boat\endash 
a craft for traveling on water\endash that foundered\'85 sank beneath the water. Another fisherman helping recover the body said he'd seen marks like this man's wound
s several times. They meant another drowning fisherman had tried to stand on this poor fellow's shoulders in the attempt to reach up to the surface\endash to reach air.\'94 
\par \'93Why is this interesting?\'94 the banker asked.
\par \'93Because of an observation made by my father at the time. He said the drowning man who climbs on your shoulders to save himself is understandable\endash except when you see it happen in the drawing room.\'94
 Paul hesitated just long enough for the banker to see the point coming, then: \'93And, I should add, except when you see it at the dinner table.\'94 
\par A sudden stillness enfolded the room.
\par That was rash, Jessica thought. This banker might have enough rank to call my son out. She saw that Idaho was poised for instant action. The House troopers were alert. Gurney Halleck had his eyes on the men opposite him.
\par \'93Ho-ho-ho-o-o-o!\'94 It was the smuggler, Tuek, head thrown back laughing with complete abandon. 
\par Nervous smiles appeared around the table. 
\par Bewt was grinning.
\par The banker had pushed his chair back, was glaring at Paul. 
\par Kynes said: \'93One baits an Atreides at his own risk.\'94 
\par \'93Is it Atreides custom to insult their guests?\'94 the banker demanded.
\par Before Paul could answer, Jessica leaned forward, said: \'93Sir!\'94 And she thought: We must learn this Harkonnen creature's game. Is he here to try for Paul? Does he have help?
\par \'93My son displays a general garment and you claim it's cut to your fit?\'94 Jessica asked. \'93What a fascinating revelation.\'94 She slid a hand down to her leg to the crysknife she had fastened in a calf-sheath.
\par The banker turned his glare on Jessica. Eyes shifted away from Paul and she saw him ease himself back from the table, freeing himself for action. He had focused on the code word: garment. \'93Prepare for violence. \'93
\par Kynes directed a speculative look at Jessica, gave a subtle hand signal to Tuek.
\par The smuggler lurched to his feet, lifted his flagon. \'93I'll give you a toast,\'94 he said. \'93To young Paul Atreides, still a lad by his looks, but a man by his actions.\'94 
\par Why do they intrude? Jessica asked herself.
\par The banker stared now at Kynes, and Jessica saw terror return to the agent's face.
\par People began responding all around the table.
\par Where Kynes leads, people follow, Jessica thought. He has told us he sides with Paul. What's the secret of his power? It can't be because he's Judge of the Change. That's temporary. And certainly not because he's a civil servant.
\par She removed her hand from the crysknife hilt, lifted her flagon to Kynes, who responded in kind.
\par Only Paul and the banker\endash  (Soo-Soo! What an idiotic nickname! Jessica thought.)\endash remained empty-handed. The banker's attention stayed fixed on Kynes. Paul stared at his plate.
\par I was handling it correctly, Paul thought. Why do they interfere? He glanced covertly at the male guests nearest him. Prepare for violence? From whom? Certainly not from that banker fellow.
\par Halleck stirred, spoke as though to no one in particular, directing his words over the heads of the guests across from him: \'93In our society, people shouldn't be quick to take offense. It's frequently suicidal.\'94 He looked
 at the stillsuit manufacturer's daughter beside him. \'93Don't you think so, miss?\'94
\par \'93Oh, yes. Yes. Indeed I do,\'94 She said. \'93There's too much violence. It makes me sick. And lots of times no offense is meant, but people die anyway. It doesn't make sense.\'94 
\par \'93Indeed it doesn't,\'94 Halleck said.
\par Jessica saw the near perfection of the girl's act, realized: That empty-headed little female is not an empty-headed little female. She saw then the pattern of the threat and understood that Halleck, too, had detected it. Th
ey had planned to lure Paul with sex. Jessica relaxed. Her son had probably been the first to see it\endash his training hadn't overlooked that obvious gambit.
\par Kynes spoke to the banker: \'93Isn't another apology in order?\'94 
\par The banker turned a sickly grin toward Jessica, said: \'93My Lady, I fear I've overindulged in your wines. You serve potent drink at table, and I'm not accustomed to it.\'94
\par Jessica heard the venom beneath his tone, spoke sweetly: \'93When strangers meet, great allowance should be made for differences of custom and training.\'94 
\par \'93Thank you, my Lady,\'94 he said.
\par The dark-haired companion of the stillsuit manufacturer leaned toward Jessica, said: \'93The Duke spoke of our being secure here. I do hope that doesn't mean more fighting.\'94
\par She was directed to lead the conversation this way, Jessica thought.
\par \'93Likely this will prove unimportant,\'94 Jessica said. \'93But there's so much detail requiring the Duke's personal attention in these times. As long as enmity continues between Atreides and Harkonnen we cannot be too carefu
l. The Duke has sworn kanly. He will leave no Harkonnen agent alive on Arrakis, of course.\'94 She glanced at the Guild Bank agent. \'93And the Conventions, naturally, support him in this.\'94 She shifted her attention to Kynes.\'94
 Is this not so, Dr. Kynes?\'94 
\par \'93Indeed it is,\'94 Kynes said.
\par The stillsuit manufacturer pulled his companion gently back. She looked at him, said: \'93I do believe I'll eat something now. I'd like some of that bird dish you served earlier.\'94
\par Jessica signaled a servant, turned to the banker: \'93And you, sir, were speaking of birds earlier and of their habits. I find so many interesting things about Arrakis. Tell me, where is the spice found? Do the hunters go deep into the desert?\'94
\par \'93Oh, no, my Lady,\'94 he said. \'93Very little's known of the deep desert. And almost nothing of the southern regions.\'94 
\par \'93There's a tale that a great Mother Lode of spice is to be found in the southern reaches,\'94 Kynes said, \'93but I suspect it was an imaginative invention made solely for purposes of a song. Some daring spice hunters 
do, on occasion, penetrate into the edge of the central belt, but that's extremely dangerous\endash 
navigation is uncertain, storms are frequent. Casualties increase dramatically the farther you operate from Shield Wall bases. It hasn't been found profitable to venture too far south. Perhaps if we had a weather satellite\'85\'94
\par Bewt looked up, spoke around a mouthful of food: \'93It's said the Fremen travel there, that they go anywhere and have hunted out soaks and sip-wells even in the southern latitudes.\'94 
\par \'93Soaks and sip-wells?\'94 Jessica asked.
\par Kynes spoke quickly: \'93Wild rumors, my Lady. These are known on other planets, not on Arrakis. A soak is a place where water seeps to the surface or near enough to the surface to be found by digging according to certain signs. A sip
-well is a form of soak where a person draws water through a straw\'85 so it is said.\'94 
\par There's deception in his words, Jessica thought. 
\par Why is he lying? Paul wondered.
\par \'93How very interesting,\'94 Jessica said. And she thought. \'93It is said\'85\'94 What a curious speech mannerism they have here. If they only knew what it reveals about their dependence on superstitions.
\par \'93I've heard you have a saying,\'94 Paul said, \'93that polish comes from the cities, wisdom from the desert.\'94 
\par \'93There are many sayings on Arrakis,\'94 Kynes said.
\par Before Jessica could frame a new question, a servant bent over her with a note. She opened it, saw the Duke's handwriting and code signs, scanned it.
\par \'93You'll all be delighted to know,\'94 she said, \'93that our Duke sends his reassurances. The matter which call
ed him away has been settled. The missing carryall has been found. A Harkonnen agent in the crew overpowered the others and flew the machine to a smugglers\rquote  base, hoping to sell it there. Both man and machine were turned over to our forces.\'94
 She nodded to Tuek. 
\par The smuggler nodded back.
\par Jessica refolded the note, tucked it into her sleeve.
\par \'93I'm glad it didn't come to open battle,\'94 the banker said. \'93The people have such hopes the Atreides will bring peace and prosperity.\'94 
\par \'93Especially prosperity,\'94 Bewt said.
\par \'93Shall we have our dessert now?\'94 Jessica asked. \'93I've had our chef prepare a Caladan sweet: pongi rice in sauce dolsa.\'94 
\par \'93It sounds wonderful,\'94 the stillsuit manufacturer said. \'93Would it be possible to get the recipe?\'94
\par \'93Any recipe you desire,\'94 Jessica said, registering the man for later mention to Hawat. The stillsuit manufacturer was a fearful little climber and could be bought.
\par Small talk resumed around her: \'93Such a lovely fabric\'85\'94 \'93He is having a setting made to match the jewel\'85\'94 \'93We might try for a production increase next quarter\'85\'94
\par Jessica stared down at her plate, thinking of the coded part of Leto's message: \'93The Harkonnens tried to get in a shipment of lasguns. We captured them. This may mean they've succeeded with other shipments. It certainly mea
ns they don't place much store in shields. Take appropriate precautions.\'94
\par Jessica focused her mind on lasguns, wondering. The white-hot beams of disruptive light could cut through any known substance, provided that substance was not shielded. The fact that
 feedback from a shield would explode both lasgun and shield did not bother the Harkonnens. Why? A lasgun-shield explosion was a dangerous variable, could be more powerful than atomics, could kill only the gunner and his shielded target.
\par The unknowns here filled her with uneasiness.
\par Paul said: \'93I never doubted we'd find the carryall. Once my father moves to solve a problem, he solves it. This is a fact the Harkonnens are beginning to discover.\'94
\par He's boasting, Jessica thought. He shouldn't boast. No person who'll be sleeping far below ground level this night as a precaution against lasguns has the right to boast.
\par 
\par 
\par \'93There is no escape\endash we pay for the violence of our ancestors. \'93
\par -from \'93The Collected Sayings of Muad'Dib\'94 by the Princess Irulan
\par 
\par Jessica heard the disturbance in the great hall, turned on the light beside her bed. The clock there had not been properly adjusted to local time, and she had to subtract twenty-one minutes to determine that it was about 2 A.M. 
\par The disturbance was loud and incoherent. 
\par Is this the Harkonnen attack? she wondered.
\par She slipped out of bed, checked the screen monitors to see where her family was. The screen showed Paul asleep in the deep cellar room they'd hastily converted to a bedroom for him. The noise obviously wasn't pene
trating to his quarters. There was no one in the Duke's room, his bed was unrumpled. Was he still at the field C.P.?
\par There were no screens yet to the front of the house. 
\par Jessica stood in the middle of her room, listening.
\par There was one shouting, incoherent voice. She heard someone call for Dr. Yueh. Jessica found a robe, pulled it over her shoulders, pushed her feet into slippers, strapped the crysknife to her leg. 
\par Again, a voice called out for Yueh.
\par Jessica belted the robe around her, stepped into the hallway. Then the thought struck her: What if Leto's hurt?
\par The hall seemed to stretch out forever under her running feet. She turned through the arch at the end, dashed past the dining hall and down the passage to the Great Hall, finding the place brightly lighted, all the wall suspensors glowing at maximum.

\par To her right near the front entry, she saw two house guards holding Duncan Idaho between them. His head lolled forward, and there was an abrupt, panting silence to the scene.
\par One of the house guards spoke accusingly to Idaho: \'93You see what you did? You woke the Lady Jessica.\'94
\par The great draperies billowed behind the men, showing that the front door remained open. There was no sign of the Duke or Yueh. Mapes stood to one side staring coldly at Idaho. She wor
e a long brown robe with serpentine design at the hem. Her feet were pushed into unlaced desert boots.
\par \'93So I woke the Lady Jessica,\'94 Idaho muttered. He lifted his face toward the ceiling, bellowed: \'93My sword was firs\rquote  blooded on Grumman!\'94 
\par Great Mother! He's drunk! Jessica thought.
\par Idaho's dark, round face was drawn into a frown. His hair, curling like the fur of a black goat, was plastered with dirt. A jagged rent in his tunic exposed an expanse of the dress shirt he had worn at the dinner party earlier. 
\par Jessica crossed to him.
\par One of the guards nodded to her without releasing his hold on Idaho. \'93We didn't know what to do with him, my Lady. He was creating a disturbance out front, refusing to come inside. We were afraid locals might come along and see him.
 That wouldn't do at all. Give us a bad name here.\'94 
\par \'93Where has he been?\'94 Jessica asked.
\par \'93He escorted one of the young ladies home from the dinner, my Lady. Hawat's orders.\'94 
\par \'93Which young lady?\'94
\par \'93One of the escort wenches. You understand, my Lady?\'94 He glanced at Mapes, lowered his voice. \'93They're always calling on Idaho for special surveillance of the ladies.\'94 
\par And Jessica thought: So they are. But why is he drunk?
\par She frowned, turned to Mapes. \'93Mapes, bring a stimulant. I'd suggest caffeine. Perhaps there's some of the spice coffee left.\'94 
\par Mapes shrugged, headed for the kitchen. Her unlaced desert boots slap-slapped against the stone floor.
\par Idaho swung his unsteady head around to peer at an angle toward Jessica. \'93Killed more'n three hunner\rquote  men f'r the Duke,\'94 he muttered. \'93Whadduh wanna know is why'm mere? Can't live unner th\rquote  groun\rquote  here. Can't live onna groun
\rquote  here. Wha\rquote  kinna place is \lquote iss, huh?\'94
\par A sound from the side hall entry caught Jessica's attention. She turned, saw Yueh crossing to them, his medical kit swinging in his left hand. He was fully dressed, looked pale, exhausted. The diamond tattoo stood out sharply on his forehead.
\par \'93Th\rquote  good docker!\'94 Idaho shouted. \'93Whad're you, Doc? Splint \lquote n\rquote  pill man?\'94 He turned blearily toward Jessica. \'93Makin\rquote  uh damn fool uh m'self, huh?\'94
\par Jessica frowned, remained silent, wondering: Why would Idaho get drunk? Was he drugged?
\par \'93Too much spice beer,\'94 Idaho said, attempting to straighten.
\par Mapes returned with a steaming cup in her hands, stopped uncertainly behind Yueh. She looked at Jessica, who shook her head.
\par Yueh put his kit on the floor, nodded greeting to Jessica, said: \'93Spice beer, eh?\'94
\par \'93Bes\rquote  damn stuff ever tas'ed,\'94 Idaho said. He tried to pull himself to attention. \'93My sword was firs\rquote  blooded on Grumman! Killed a Harkon\'85 Harkon\'85 killed \lquote im f'r th\rquote  Duke.\'94 
\par Yueh turned, looked at the cup in Mapes\rquote  hand. 
\par \'93What is that?\'94 
\par \'93Caffeine,\'94 Jessica said.
\par Yueh took the cup, held it toward Idaho. \'93Drink this, lad.\'94 
\par \'93Don't wan\rquote  any more f drink.\'94 
\par \'93Drink it, I say!\'94
\par Idaho's head wobbled toward Yueh, and he stumbled one step ahead, dragging the guards with him. \'93I'm almighdy fed up with pleasin\rquote  th\rquote  \lquote Mperial Universe, Doc. Jus\rquote  once, we're gonna do th\rquote  thing my way.\'94 
\par \'93After you drink this,\'94 Yueh said. \'93It's just caffeine.\'94 
\par \'93 \lquote Sprolly like all res\rquote  uh this place! Damn\rquote  sun \lquote stoo brighd. Nothin\rquote  has uh righd color. Ever'thing's wrong or\'85 \'94 
\par \'93Well, it's nighttime now,\'94 Yueh said. He spoke reasonably. \'93Drink this like a good lad. It'll make you feel better.\'94 
\par \'93Don\rquote  wanna feel bedder!\'94
\par \'93We can't argue with him all night,\'94 Jessica said. And she thought: This calls for shock treatment.
\par \'93There's no reason for you to stay, my Lady,\'94 Yueh said. \'93I can take care of this.\'94
\par Jessica shook her head. She stepped forward, slapped Idaho sharply across the cheek.
\par He stumbled back with his guards, glaring at her.
\par \'93This is no way to act in your Duke's home,\'94 she said. She snatched the cup from Yueh's hands, spilling part of it, thrust the cup toward Idaho. \'93Now drink this! That's an order!\'94 
\par Idaho jerked himself upright, scowling down at her. He spoke slowly, with careful and precise enunciation: \'93I do not take orders from a damn\rquote  Harkonnen spy.\'94 
\par Yueh stiffened, whirled to face Jessica.
\par Her face had gone pale, but she was nodding. It all became clear to her\endash 
the broken stems of meaning she had seen in words and actions around her these past few days could now be translated. She found herself in the grip of anger almost too great to contain. It took the most profound of her Bene Gesserit training to qu
iet her pulse and smooth her breathing. Even then she could feel the blaze flickering.
\par They were always calling on Idaho for surveillance of the ladies! 
\par She shot a glance at Yueh. The doctor lowered his eyes. 
\par \'93You knew this?\'94 she demanded.
\par \'93I\'85 heard rumors, my Lady. But I didn't want to add to your burdens.\'94
\par \'93Hawat!\'94 she snapped. \'93I want Thufir Hawat brought to me immediately!\'94 
\par \'93But, my Lady\'85 \'94 
\par \'93Immediately!\'94
\par It has to be Hawat, she thought. Suspicion such as this could come from no other source without being discarded immediately.
\par Idaho shook his head, mumbled. \'93Chuck th\rquote  whole damn thing.\'94
\par Jessica looked down at the cup in her hand, abruptly dashed its contents across Idaho's face. \'93Lock him in one of the guest rooms of the east wing,\'94 she ordered. \'93Let him sleep it off.\'94 
\par The two guards stared at her unhappily. One ventured: \'93Perhaps we should take him someplace else, m'Lady. We could\'85 \'94 
\par \'93He's supposed to be here!\'94 Jessica snapped. \'93He has a job to do here.\'94 Her voice dripped bitterness. \'93He's so good at watching the ladies.\'94 
\par The guard swallowed.
\par \'93Do you know where the Duke is?\'94 she demanded. 
\par \'93He's at the command post, my Lady.\'94 
\par \'93Is Hawat with him?\'94 
\par \'93Hawat's in the city, my Lady.\'94
\par \'93You will bring Hawat to me at once,\'94 Jessica said. \'93I will be in my sitting room when he arrives.\'94 
\par \'93But, my Lady\'85 \'94
\par \'93If necessary, I will call the Duke,\'94 she said. \'93I hope it will not be necessary. I would not want to disturb him with this.\'94
\par \'93Yes, my Lady.\'94
\par Jessica thrust the empty cup into Mapes\rquote  hands, met the questioning stare of the blue-within-blue eyes. \'93You may return to bed, Mapes.\'94 
\par \'93You're sure you'll not need me?\'94 
\par Jessica smiled grimly. \'93I'm sure.\'94
\par \'93Perhaps this could wait until tomorrow,\'94 Yueh said. \'93I could give you a sedative and\'85 \'94
\par \'93You will return to your quarters and leave me to handle this my way,\'94 she said. She patted his arm to take the sting out of her command. \'93This is the only way.\'94
\par Abruptly, head high, she turned and stalked off through the house to her rooms. Cold walls\'85 passages\'85 a familiar door\'85
 She jerked the door open, strode in, and slammed it behind her. Jessica stood there glaring at the shield-blanked windows of her sitting room. Hawat! Could he be the one the Harkonnens bought? We shall see.
\par Jessica crossed to the deep, old-fashioned armch
air with an embroidered cover of schlag skin, moved the chair into position to command the door. She was suddenly very conscious of the crysknife in its sheath on her leg. She removed the sheath and strapped it to her arm, tested the drop of it. Once more
, she glanced around the room, placing everything precisely in her mind against any emergency: the chaise near the corner, the straight chairs along the wall, the two low tables, her stand-mounted zither beside the door to her bedroom.
\par Pale rose light glowed from the suspensor lamps. She dimmed them, sat down in the armchair, patting the upholstery, appreciating the chair's regal heaviness for this occasion.
\par Now, let him come, she thought. We shall see what we shall see. And she prepared herself in the Bene Gesserit fashion for the wait, accumulating patience, saving her strength.
\par Sooner than she had expected, a rap sounded at the door and Hawat entered at her command.
\par She watched him without moving from the chair, seeing the crackling sense of drug-induced e
nergy in his movements, seeing the fatigue beneath. Hawat's rheumy old eyes glittered. His leathery skin appeared faintly yellow in the room's light, and there was a wide, wet stain on the sleeve of his knife arm. 
\par She smelled blood there.
\par Jessica gestured to one of the straight-backed chairs, said: \'93Bring that chair and sit facing me.\'94
\par Hawat bowed, obeyed. That drunken fool of an Idaho! he thought. He studied Jessica's face, wondering how he could save this situation.
\par \'93It's long past time to clear the air between us,\'94 Jessica said. 
\par \'93What troubles my Lady?\'94 He sat down, placed hands on knees.
\par \'93Don't play coy with me!\'94 she snapped. \'93If Yueh didn't tell you why I summoned you, then one of your spies in my household did. Shall we be at least that honest with each other?\'94 
\par \'93As you wish, my Lady.\'94
\par \'93First, you will answer me one question,\'94 she said. \'93Are you now a Harkonnen agent?\'94
\par Hawat surged half out of his chair, his face dark with fury, demanding: \'93You dare insult me so?\'94 
\par \'93Sit down,\'94 she said. \'93You insulted me so.\'94 
\par Slowly, he sank back into the chair.
\par And Jessica, reading the signs of this face that she knew so well, allowed herself a deep breath. It isn't Hawat.
\par \'93Now I know you remain loyal to my Duke,\'94 she said. \'93I'm prepared, therefore, to forgive your affront to me.\'94 
\par \'93Is there something to forgive?\'94
\par Jessica scowled, wondering: Shall I play my trump? Shall I tell him of the Duke's daughter I've carried within me these few weeks? No\'85 Leto himself doesn't know. This would only complicate his life, divert hi
m in a time when he must concentrate on our survival. There is yet time to use this.
\par \'93A Truthsayer would solve this,\'94 she said, \'93but we have no Truthsayer qualified by the High Board.\'94 
\par \'93As you say. We've no Truthsayer.\'94
\par \'93Is there a traitor among us?\'94 she asked. \'93
I've studied our people with great care. Who could it be? Not Gurney. Certainly not Duncan. Their lieutenants are not strategically enough placed to consider. It's not you, Thufir. It cannot be Paul. I know it's not me. Dr. Yueh, then? Shall I call
 him in and put him to the test?\'94 
\par \'93You know that's an empty gesture,\'94 Hawat said. \'93He's conditioned by the High College. That I know for certain.\'94 
\par \'93Not to mention that his wife was a Bene Gesserit slain by the Harkonnens,\'94 Jessica said.
\par \'93So that's what happened to her,\'94 Hawat said.
\par \'93Haven't you heard the hate in his voice when he speaks the Harkonnen name?\'94 
\par \'93You know I don't have the ear,\'94 Hawat said. 
\par \'93What brought this base suspicion on me?\'94 she asked.
\par Hawat frowned. \'93My Lady puts her servant in an impossible position. My first loyalty is to the Duke.\'94
\par \'93I'm prepared to forgive much because of that loyalty,\'94 she said.
\par \'93And again I must ask: Is there something to forgive?\'94 
\par \'93Stalemate?\'94 she asked. 
\par He shrugged.
\par \'93Let us discuss something else for a minute, then,\'94 she said. \'93
Duncan Idaho, the admirable fighting man whose abilities at guarding and surveillance are so esteemed. Tonight, he overindulged in something called spice beer. I hear reports that others among our people have been stupefied by this conco
ction. Is that true?\'94 
\par \'93You have your reports, my Lady.\'94 
\par \'93So I do. Don't you see this drinking as a symptom, Thufir?\'94 
\par \'93My Lady speaks riddles.\'94
\par \'93Apply your Mentat abilities to it!\'94 she snapped. \'93What's the problem with Duncan and the others? I can tell you in four words\endash they have no home.\'94 
\par He jabbed a finger at the floor. \'93Arrakis, that's their home.\'94 
\par \'93Arrakis is an unknown! Caladan was their home, but we've uprooted them. They have no home. And they fear the Duke's failing them.\'94
\par He stiffened. \'93Such talk from one of the men would be cause for\endash \'94
\par \'93Oh, stop that, Thufir. Is it defeatist or treacherous for a doctor to diagnose a disease correctly? My only intention is to cure the disease.\'94 
\par \'93The Duke gives me charge over such matters.\'94 
\par \'93But you understand I have a certain natural concern over the progress of this disease,\'94 she said. \'93And perhaps you'll grant I have certain abilities along these lines.\'94
\par Will I have to shock him severely? she wondered. He needs shaking up\endash something to break him from routine.
\par \'93There could be many interpretations for your concern,\'94 Hawat said. He shrugged.
\par \'93Then you've already convicted me?\'94
\par \'93Of course not, my Lady. But I cannot afford to take any chances, the situation being what it is.\'94
\par \'93A threat to my son got past you right here in this house,\'94 she said. \'93Who took that chance?\'94 
\par His face darkened. \'93I offered my resignation to the Duke.\'94 
\par \'93Did you offer your resignation to me\'85 or to Paul?\'94 
\par Now he was openly angry, betraying it in quickness of breathing, in dilation of nostrils, a steady stare. She saw a pulse beating at his temple.
\par \'93I'm the Duke's man,\'94 he said, biting off the words.
\par \'93There is no traitor,\'94 she said. \'93The threat's something else. Perhaps it has to do with the lasguns. Perhaps they'll risk secreting a few lasguns with timing mechanisms aimed at house shields. Perhaps they'll\'85 \'94
\par \'93And who could tell after the blast if the explosion wasn't atomic?\'94 he asked. \'93No, my Lady. They'll not risk anything that illegal. Radiation lingers. The evidence is hard to erase. No. They'll observe most of the forms. It has to be a traitor.
\'94 
\par \'93You're the Duke's man,\'94 she sneered. \'93Would you destroy him in the effort to save him?\'94
\par He took a deep breath, then: \'93If you're innocent, you'll have my most abject apologies.\'94
\par \'93Look at you now, Thufir,\'94 she said. \'93
Humans live best when each has his own place, when each knows where he belongs in the scheme of things. Destroy the place and destroy the person. You and I, Thufir, of all those who love the Duke, are most ideally situated to destroy the
 other's place. Could I not whisper suspicions about you into the Duke's ear at night? When would he be most susceptible to such whispering, Thufir? Must I draw it for you more clearly?\'94 
\par \'93You threaten me?\'94 he growled.
\par \'93Indeed not. I merely point out to you that someone is attacking us through the basic arrangement of our lives. It's clever, diabolical. I propose to negate this attack by so ordering our lives that there'll be no chinks for such barbs to enter.\'94 

\par \'93You accuse me of whispering baseless suspicions?\'94 
\par \'93Baseless, yes.\'94 
\par \'93You'd meet this with your own whispers?\'94 
\par \'93Your life is compounded of whispers, not mine, Thufir.\'94 
\par \'93Then you question my abilities?\'94
\par She sighed. \'93Thufir, I want you to examine your own emotional involvement in this. The natural h
uman's an animal without logic. Your projections of logic onto all affairs is unnatural, but suffered to continue for its usefulness. You're the embodiment of logic\endash 
a Mentat. Yet, your problem solutions are concepts that, in a very real sense, are projected outside yourself, there to be studied and rolled around, examined from all sides.\'94
\par \'93You think now to teach me my trade?\'94 he asked, and he did not try to hide the disdain in his voice.
\par \'93Anything outside yourself, this you can see and apply your logic to it,\'94 she said. \'93
But it's a human trait that when we encounter personal problems, those things most deeply personal are the most difficult to bring out for our logic to scan. We tend to flounder around, blaming everything but the actual, deep-seated thing th
at's really chewing on us.\'94
\par \'93You're deliberately attempting to undermine my faith in my abilities as a Mentat,\'94 he rasped. \'93Were I to find one of our people attempting thus to sabotage any other weapon in our arsenal, I should not hesitate to denounce and destroy him.\'94 

\par \'93The finest Mentats have a healthy respect for the error factor in their computations,\'94 she said. 
\par \'93I've never said otherwise!\'94
\par \'93Then apply yourself to these symptoms we've both seen: drunkenness among the men, quarrels\endash they gossip and exchange wild rumors about Arrakis; they ignore the most simple\endash \'94 
\par \'93Idleness, no more,\'94 he said. \'93Don't try to divert my attention by trying to make a simple matter appear mysterious.\'94 
\par She stared at him, thinking of the Duke's men rubbing their woes together i
n the barracks until you could almost smell the charge there, like burnt insulation. They're becoming like the men of the pre-Guild legend, she thought: Like the men of the lost star-searcher, Ampoliros\endash sick at their guns\endash 
forever seeking, forever prepared and forever unready.
\par \'93Why have you never made full use of my abilities in your service to the Duke?\'94 she asked. \'93Do you fear a rival for your position?\'94
\par He glared at her, the old eyes blazing. \'93I know some of the training they give you Bene Gesserit\'85 \'94 He broke off, scowling.
\par \'93Go ahead, say it,\'94 she said. \'93Bene Gesserit witches.\'94 
\par \'93I know something of the real training they give you,\'94 he said. \'93I've seen it come out in Paul. I'm not fooled by what your schools tell the public: you exist only to serve.\'94
\par The shock must be severe and he's almost ready for it, she thought.
\par \'93You listen respectfully to me in Council,\'94 she said, \'93yet you seldom heed my advice. Why?\'94
\par \'93I don't trust your Bene Gesserit motives,\'94 he said. \'93You may think you can look through a man; you may think you can make a man do exactly what you\endash \'94 
\par \'93You poor fool, Thufir!\'94 she raged. 
\par He scowled, pushing himself back in the chair.
\par \'93Whatever rumors you've heard about our schools,\'94 she said, \'93the truth is far greater. If I wished to destroy the Duke\'85 or you, or any other person within my reach, you could not stop me.\'94 
\par And she thought: Why do I let pride drive such words out of me? This is not the way I was trained. This is not how I must shock him.
\par Hawat slipped a hand beneath his tunic where he kept a tiny projector of poison darts. She wears no shield, he thought. Is this just a brag she makes? I could slay her now\'85 but, ah-h-h-h, the consequences if I'm wrong.
\par Jessica saw the gesture toward his pocket, said: \'93Let us pray violence shall never be necessary between us.\'94 
\par \'93A worthy prayer,\'94 he agreed.
\par \'93Meanwhile, the sickness spreads among us,\'94 she said. \'93I must ask you again: Isn't it more reasonable to suppose the Harkonnens have planted this suspicion to pit the two of us against each other?\'94 
\par \'93We appear to've returned to stalemate,\'94 he said. 
\par She sighed, thinking: He's almost ready for it.
\par \'93The Duke and I are father and mother surrogates to our people,\'94 she said. \'93The position\endash \'94 
\par \'93He hasn't married you,\'94 Hawat said.
\par She forced herself to calmness, thinking: A good riposte, that.
\par \'93But he'll not marry anyone else,\'94 she said. \'93Not as long as I live. And we are surrogates, as I've said. To break up this natural order in our affairs, to disturb, disrupt, and confuse us\endash which target offers itself most entici
ngly to the Harkonnens?\'94
\par He sensed the direction she was taking, and his brows drew down in a lowering scowl.
\par \'93The Duke?\'94 she asked. \'93Attractive target, yes, but no one with the possible exception of Paul is better guarded. Me? I tempt them, surely, but th
ey must know the Bene Gesserit make difficult targets. And there's a better target, one whose duties create, necessarily, a monstrous blind spot. One to whom suspicion is as natural as breathing. One who builds his entire life on innuendo and mystery.\'94
 She darted her right hand toward him. \'93You!\'94 
\par Hawat started to leap from his chair. 
\par \'93I have not dismissed you, Thufir!\'94 she flared.
\par The old Mentat almost fell back into the chair, so quickly did his muscles betray him.
\par She smiled without mirth.
\par \'93Now you know something of the real training they give us,\'94 she said.
\par Hawat tried to swallow in a dry throat. Her command had been regal, preemptory\endash uttered in a tone and manner he had found completely irresistible. His body had obeyed her before he could think about it. Nothing could have prevented his response
\endash not logic, not passionate anger\'85 nothing. To do what she had done spoke of a sensitive, intimate knowledge of the person thus commanded, a depth of control he had not dreamed possible.
\par \'93I have said to you before that we should understand each other,\'94 she said. \'93I meant you should understand me. I already understand you. And I tell you now that your loyalty to the Duke is all that guarantees your safety with me.\'94 
\par He stared at her, wet his lips with his tongue.
\par \'93If I desired a puppet, the Duke would marry me,\'94 she said. \'93He might even think he did it of his own free will.\'94 
\par Hawat lowered his head, looked upward through his sparse lashes. Only the most rigid control kept him from calling the guard. Control\'85 and the 
suspicion now that woman might not permit it. His skin crawled with the memory of how she had controlled him. In the moment of hesitation, she could have drawn a weapon and killed him!
\par Does every human have this blind spot? he wondered. Can any of us be ordered into action before he can resist? The idea staggered him. Who could stop a person with such power?
\par \'93You've glimpsed the fist within the Bene Gesserit glove,\'94 she said. \'93Few glimpse it and live. And what I did was a relatively simple thing for us. You've not seen my entire arsenal. Think on that,\'94 
\par \'93Why aren't you out destroying the Duke's enemies?\'94 he asked.
\par \'93What would you have me destroy?\'94 she asked. \'93Would you have me make a weakling of our Duke, have him forever leaning on me?\'94 
\par \'93But, with such power\'85 \'94
\par \'93Power's a two-edged sword, Thufir,\'94 she said; \'93You think: \lquote How easy for her to shape a human tool to thrust into an enemy's vitals.\rquote 
 True, Thufir; even into your vitals. Yet, what would I accomplish? If enough of us Bene Gesserit did this, wouldn't it make all Bene Gesserit suspect? We don't want that, Thufir. We do not wish to destroy ourselves.\'94 She nodded. \'93
We truly exist only to serve.\'94 
\par \'93I cannot answer you,\'94 he said. \'93You know I cannot answer.\'94 
\par \'93You'll say nothing about what has happened here to anyone,\'94 she said. \'93I know you, Thufir.\'94
\par \'93My Lady\'85 \'94 Again the old man tried to swallow in a dry throat.
\par And he thought: She has great powers, yes. But would these not make her an even more formidable tool for the Harkonnens?
\par \'93The Duke could be destroyed as quickly by his friends as by his enemies,\'94 she said. \'93I trust now you'll get to the bottom of this suspicion and remove it.\'94 
\par \'93If it proves baseless,\'94 he said. 
\par \'93If,\'94 she sneered. 
\par \'93If,\'94 he said.
\par \'93You are tenacious,\'94 she said.
\par \'93Cautious,\'94 he said, \'93and aware of the error factor.\'94 
\par \'93Then I'll pose another question for you: What does it mean to you that you stand before another human, that you are bound and helpless and the other human holds a knife at your throat\endash yet this other human refrains from kill
ing you, frees you from your bonds and gives you the knife to use as you will?\'94
\par She lifted herself out of the chair, turned her back on him. \'93You may go now, Thufir.\'94
\par The old Mentat arose, hesitated, hand creeping toward the deadly weapon beneath his tunic
. He was reminded of the bull ring and of the Duke's father (who'd been brave, no matter what his other failings) and one day of the corrida long ago: The fierce black beast had stood there, head bowed, immobilized and confused. The Old Duke had turned hi
s back on the horns, cape thrown flamboyantly over one arm, while cheers rained down from the stands.
\par I am the bull and she the matador, Hawat thought. He withdrew his hand from the weapon, glanced at the sweat glistening in his empty palm.
\par And he knew that whatever the facts proved to be in the end, he would never forget this moment nor lose this sense of supreme admiration for the Lady Jessica. 
\par Quietly, he turned and left the room.
\par Jessica lowered her gaze from the reflection in the windows, turned, and stared at the closed door.
\par \'93Now we'll see some proper action,\'94 she whispered.
\par 
\par 
\par Do you wrestle with dreams? 
\par Do you contend with shadows? 
\par Do you move in a kind of sleep? 
\par Time has slipped away. 
\par Your life is stolen. 
\par You tarried with trifles, 
\par Victim of your folly.
\par -Dirge for Jamis on the Funeral Plain, from \'93Songs of Muad'Dib\'94 by the Princess Irulan
\par 
\par Leto stood in the foyer of his house, studying a note by the light of a single suspensor lamp. Dawn was yet a few hours away, and he felt his tiredness. A Fre
men messenger had brought the note to the outer guard just now as the Duke arrived from his command post.
\par The note read: \'93A column of smoke by day, a pillar of fire by night.\'94 
\par There was no signature.
\par What does it mean? he wondered.
\par The messenger had gone without waiting for an answer and before he could be questioned. He had slipped into the night like some smoky shadow.
\par Leto pushed the paper into a tunic pocket, thinking to show it to Hawat later. He brushed a lock of hair from his forehead, took a sighin
g breath. The anti-fatigue pills were beginning to wear thin. It had been a long two days since the dinner party and longer than that since he had slept.
\par On top of all the military problems, there'd been the disquieting session with Hawat, the report on his meeting with Jessica.
\par Should I waken Jessica? he wondered. There's no reason to play the secrecy game with her any longer. Or is there? 
\par Blast and damn that Duncan Idaho!
\par He shook his head. No, not Duncan. I was wrong not to take Jessica into my confidence from the first. I must do it now, before more damage is done.
\par The decision made him feel better, and he hurried from the foyer through the Great Hall and down the passages toward the family wing.
\par At the turn where the passages split to the service area,
 he paused. A strange mewling came from somewhere down the service passage. Leto put his left hand to the switch on his shield belt, slipped his kindjal into his right hand. The knife conveyed a sense of reassurance. That strange sound had sent a chill th
rough him.
\par Softly, the Duke moved down the service passage, cursing the inadequate illumination. The smallest of suspensors had been spaced about eight meters apart along here and tuned to their dimmest level. The dark stone walls swallowed the light.
\par A dull blob stretching across the floor appeared out of the gloom ahead.
\par Leto hesitated, almost activated his shield, but refrained because that would limit his movements, his hearing\'85 and because the captured shipment of lasguns had left him filled with doubts.
\par Silently, he moved toward the grey blob, saw that it was a human figure, a man face down on the stone. Leto turned him over with a foot, knife poised, bent close in the dim light to see the face. It was the smuggler, Tuek, a wet stain down his chest. The
 dead eyes stared with empty darkness. Leto touched the stain\endash warm.
\par How could this man be dead here? Leto asked himself. Who killed him?
\par The mewling sound was louder here. It came from ahead and down the side passage to the central room where they had installed the main shield generator for the house.
\par Hand on belt switch, kindjal poised, the Duke skirted the body, slipped down the passage and peered around the corner toward the shield generator room.
\par Another grey blob lay stretched on the floor a few paces away, and he saw at once this was the source of the noise. The shape crawled toward him with painful slowness, gasping, mumbling.
\par Leto stilled his sudden constriction of fear, darted down the passage, crouched beside the crawling figure. It was Mapes, the 
Fremen housekeeper, her hair tumbled around her face, clothing disarrayed. A dull shininess of dark stain spread from her back along her side. He touched her shoulder and she lifted herself on her elbows, head tipped up to peer at him, the eyes black-shad
owed emptiness.
\par \'93S'you,\'94 she gasped. \'93Killed\'85 guard\'85 sent\'85 get\'85 Tuek\'85 escape\'85 m'Lady\'85 you\'85 you\'85 here\'85 no\'85 \'94 She flopped forward, her head thumping against the stone.
\par Leto felt for pulse at the temples. There was none. He looked at the stain: she'd been stabbed in the back. Who? His mind raced. Did she mean someone had killed a guard? And Tuek\endash had Jessica sent for him? Why?
\par He started to stand up. A sixth sense warned him. He flashed a hand toward the shield switch\endash too late. A numbing shock slammed his arm as
ide. He felt pain there, saw a dart protruding from the sleeve, sensed paralysis spreading from it up his arm. It took an agonizing effort to lift his head and look down the passage.
\par Yueh stood in the open door of the generator room. His face reflected yellow from the light of a single, brighter suspensor above the door. There was stillness from the room behind him\endash no sound of generators.
\par Yueh! Leto thought. He's sabotaged the house generators! We \lquote re wide open!
\par Yueh began walking toward him, pocketing a dartgun.
\par Leto found he could still speak, gasped: \'93Yueh! How?\'94 Then the paralysis reached his legs and he slid to the floor with his back propped against the stone wall.
\par Yueh's face carried a look of sadness as he bent over, touched Leto's forehead. The Duke found he could feel the touch, but it was remote\'85 dull.
\par \'93The drug on the dart is selective,\'94 Yueh said \'93You can speak, but I'd advise against it.\'94 He glanced down the hall, and again bent over Leto, pulled out the dart, tossed it aside. The sound of the d
art clattering on the stones was faint and distant to the Duke's ears. 
\par It can't be Yueh, Leto thought. He's conditioned. 
\par \'93How?\'94 Leto whispered.
\par \'93I'm sorry, my dear Duke, but there are things which will make greater demands than this.\'94 He touched the diamond tattoo on his forehead. \'93I find it very strange, myself\endash an override on my pyretic conscience\endash 
but I wish to kill a man. Yes, I actually wish it. I will stop at nothing to do it.\'94
\par He looked down at the Duke. \'93Oh, not you, my dear Duke. The Baron Harkonnen. I wish to kill the Baron.\'94 
\par \'93Bar\'85 on Har\'85 \'94
\par \'93Be quiet, please, my poor Duke. You haven't much time. That peg tooth I put in your mouth after the tumble at Narcal\endash that tooth must be replaced, in a moment, I'll render you unconscious and replace that tooth.\'94
 He opened his hand, stared at something in it. \'93An exact duplicate, its core shaped most exquisitely like a nerve. It'll escape the usual detectors, even a fast scanning. But if you bite down hard on it, the cover crushes. Then, when you expel your br
eath sharply, you fill the air around you with a poison gas\endash most deadly.\'94
\par Leto stared up at Yueh, seeing madness in the man's eyes, the perspiration along brown and chin.
\par \'93You were dead anyway, my poor Duke,\'94 Yueh said. \'93But you will get close to the Baron before you die. He'll believe you're stupefied by drugs beyond any dying effort to attack him. And you will be drugged\endash 
and tied. But attack can take strange forms. And you will remember the tooth. The tooth, Duke Leto Atreides. You will remember the tooth.\'94
\par The old doctor leaned closer and closer until his face and drooping mustache dominated Leto's narrowing vision. 
\par \'93The tooth,\'94 Yueh muttered. 
\par \'93Why?\'94 Leto whispered.
\par Yueh lowered himself to one knee beside the Duke. \'93I made a shaitan's bargain with the Ba
ron. And I must be certain he has fulfilled his half of it. When I see him, I'll know. When I look at the Baron, then I will know. But I'll never enter his presence without the price. You're the price, my poor Duke. And I'll know when I see him. My poor W
anna taught me many things, and one is to see certainty of truth when the stress is great. I cannot do it always, but when I see the Baron\endash then, I will know.\'94
\par Leto tried to look down at the tooth in Yueh's hand. He felt this was happening in a nightmare\endash it could not be.
\par Yueh's purple lips turned up in a grimace. \'93I'll not get close enough to the Baron, or I'd do this myself. No. I'll be detained at a safe distance. But you\'85 ah, now! You, my lovely weapon! He'll want you close to him\endash to gloat over you, to boa
st a little.\'94 
\par Leto found himself almost hypnotized by a muscle on the left side of Yueh's jaw. The muscle twisted when the man spoke.
\par Yueh leaned closer. \'93And you, my good Duke, my precious Duke, you must remember this tooth.\'94 He held it up between thumb and forefinger. \'93It will be all that remains to you.\'94 
\par Leto's mouth moved without sound, then: \'93Refuse.\'94 
\par \'93Ah-h, no! You mustn't refuse. Because, in return for this small service. I'm doing a thing for you. I will save your son and your woman. No other can do it. They can be removed to a place where no Harkonnen can reach them.\'94 
\par \'93How\'85 save\'85 them?\'94 Leto whispered.
\par \'93By making it appear they're dead, by secreting them among people who draw knife at hearing the Harkonnen name, who hate the Harkonnens so much they'll burn a chair in which a Harkonnen has sat, salt the ground over which a Harkonnen has walked.\'94
 He touched Leto's jaw. \'93Can you feel anything in your jaw?\'94 
\par The Duke found that he could not answer. He sensed distant tugging, saw Yueh's hand come up with the ducal signet ring.
\par \'93For Paul,\'94 Yueh said. \'93You'll be unconscious presently. Good-by, my poor Duke. When next we meet we'll have no time for conversation.\'94
\par Cool remoteness spread upward from Leto's jaw, across his cheeks. The shadowy, hall narrowed to a pinpoint with Yueh's purple lips centered in it.
\par \'93Remember the tooth!\'94 Yueh hissed. \'93The tooth!\'94

\par Jessica awoke in the dark, feeling premonition in the stillness around her. She could not understand why her mind and body felt so sluggish. Skin raspings of fear ran along her nerves. She thought of sitting up and turning on a light, but 
something stayed the decision. Her mouth felt\'85 strange. 
\par Lump-lump-lump-lump!
\par It was a dull sound, directionless in the dark. Somewhere.
\par The waiting moment was packed with time, with rustling needle-stick movements.
\par She began to feel her body, grew aware of bindings on wrists and ankles, a gag in her mouth. She was on her side, hands tied behind her. She tested the bindings, realized they were krimskell fiber, would only claw tighter as she pulled. 
\par And now, she remembered.
\par There had been movement in the darkness of her bedroom, something wet and pungent slapped against her face, filling her mouth, hands grasping for her. She had gasped\endash one indrawn breath\endash 
sensing the narcotic in the wetness. Consciousness had receded, sinking her into a black bin of terror.
\par It has come, she thought. How simple it was to subdue the Bene Gesserit. All it took was treachery. Hawat was right. 
\par She forced herself not to pull on her bindings.
\par This is not my bedroom, she thought. They've taken me someplace else.
\par Slowly, she marshaled the inner calmness.
\par She grew aware of the smell of her own stale sweat with its chemical infusion of fear.
\par Where is Paul? she asked herself. My son\endash what have they done to him?
\par Calmness.
\par She forced herself to it, using the ancient routines. 
\par But terror remained so near. 
\par Leto? Where are you, Leto?
\par She sensed a diminishing in the dark. It began with shadows. Dimensions separated, became new thorns of awareness. White. A line under a door. 
\par I'm on the floor.
\par People walking. She sensed it through the floor.
\par Jessica squeezed back the memory of terror. I must remain calm, alert, and prepared. I may get only one chance. Again, she forced the inner calmness.
\par The ungainly thumping of her heartbeats evened, shaping out time. She counted back. I was unconscious about an hour. She closed her eyes, focused her awareness onto the approaching footsteps.
\par Four people.
\par She counted the differences in their steps.
\par I must pretend I'm still unconscious. She relaxed against the cold floor, testing her body's readiness, heard a door open, sensed increased light through her eyelids.
\par Feet approached: someone standing over her.
\par \'93You are awake,\'94 rumbled a basso voice. \'93Do not pretend.\'94 
\par She opened her eyes.
\par The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood over her. Around them, she recognized the cellar room where Paul had slept, saw his cot at one side\endash 
empty. Suspensor lamps were brought in by guards, distributed near the open door. There was a glare of light in the hallway beyond that hurt her eyes.
\par She looked up at the Baron. He wore a yellow cape that bulged over his portable suspensors. The fat cheeks were two cherubic mounds beneath spider-black eyes.
\par \'93The drug was timed,\'94 he rumbled. \'93We knew to the minute when you'd be coming out of it.\'94
\par How could that be? she wondered. They \lquote d have to know my exact weight, my metabolism, my\'85 Yueh!
\par \'93Such a pity you must remain gagged,\'94 the Baron said. \'93We could have such an interesting conversation.\'94 
\par Yueh's the only one it could be, she thought. How? 
\par The Baron glanced behind him at the door. \'93Come in, Piter.\'94
\par She had never before seen the man who entered to stand beside the Baron, but the face was known\endash and the man: Piter de Vries, the Mentat-Assassin. She studied him\endash 
hawk features, blue-ink eyes that suggested he was a native of Arrakis, but subtleties of movement and stance told her he was not. And his flesh was too well firmed with water. He was tall, though slender, and something about him suggested effeminacy.

\par \'93Such a pity we cannot have our conversation, my dear Lady Jessica.\'94 the Baron said. \'93However, I'm aware of your abilities.\'94 He glanced at the Mentat. \'93Isn't that true, Piter?\'94 
\par \'93As you say, Baron,\'94 the man said.
\par The voice was tenor. It touched her spine with a wash of coldness. She had never heard such a chill voice. To one with the Bene Gesserit training, the voice screamed: Killer!
\par \'93I have a surprise for Piter,\'94 the Baron said. \'93He thinks he has come here to collect his reward\endash you, Lady Jessica. But I wish to demonstrate a thing: that he does not really want you.\'94 
\par \'93You play with me, Baron?\'94 Piter asked, and he smiled.
\par Seeing that smile, Jessica wondered that the Baron did not leap to defend himself from this Piter. Then she corrected herself. The Baron could not read that smile. He did not have the Training.
\par \'93In many ways, Piter is quite naive,\'94 the Baron said. \'93He doesn't admit to himself what a deadly creature you are, Lady Jessica. I'd show him, but it'd be a foolish risk.\'94 The Baron smiled at Piter, whose face had become a waiting mask. \'93
I know what Piter really wants. Piter wants power.\'94
\par \'93You promised I could have her,\'94 Piter said. The tenor voice had lost some of its cold reserve.
\par Jessica heard the clue-tones in the man's voice, allowed herself an inward shudder. How could the Baron have made such an animal out of a Mentat?
\par \'93I give you a choice, Piter,\'94 the Baron said. 
\par \'93What choice?\'94
\par The Baron snapped fat fingers. \'93This woman and exile from the Imperium, or the Duchy of Atreides on Arrakis to rule as you see fit in my name.\'94 
\par Jessica watched the Baron's spider eyes study Piter. 
\par \'93You could be Duke here in all but name,\'94 the Baron said.
\par Is my Leto dead, then? Jessica asked herself. She felt a silent wail begin somewhere in her mind.
\par The Baron kept his attention on the Mentat. \'93Understand yourself, Piter. You want her because she was a Duke's woman, a symbol of his power\endash 
beautiful, useful, exquisitely trained for her role. But an entire duchy, Piter! That's more than a symbol; that's the reality. With it you could have many women\'85 and more.\'94 
\par \'93You do not joke with Piter?\'94
\par The Baron turned with that dancing lightness the suspensors gave him. \'93Joke? I? Remember\endash I am giving up the boy. You heard what the traitor said about the lad's training. They are alike, this mother and son\endash deadly.\'94 The Baron smiled. 
\'93I must go now. I will send in the guard I've res
erved for this moment. He's stone deaf. His orders will be to convey you on the first leg of your journey into exile. He will subdue this woman if he sees her gain control of you. He'll not permit you to untie her gag until you're off Arrakis. If you choo
se not to leave\'85 he has other orders.\'94 
\par \'93You don't have to leave,\'94 Piter said. \'93I've chosen.\'94 
\par \'93Ah, hah!\'94 the Baron chortled. \'93Such quick decision can mean only one thing.\'94 
\par \'93I will take the duchy,\'94 Piter said.
\par And Jessica thought: Doesn't Piter know the Baron's lying to him? But\endash how could he know? He's a twisted Mentat.
\par The Baron glanced down at Jessica. \'93Is it not wonderful that I know Piter so well? I wagered with my Master at Arms that this would be Piter's choice. Hah! Well, I leave now. This is much be
tter. Ah-h, much better. You understand, Lady Jessica? I hold no rancor toward you. It's a necessity. Much better this way. Yes. And I've not actually ordered you destroyed. When it's asked of me what happened to you, I can shrug it off in all truth.\'94 

\par \'93You leave it to me then?\'94 Piter asked.
\par \'93The guard I send you will take your orders,\'94 the Baron said. \'93Whatever's done I leave to you.\'94 He stared at Piter. \'93Yes. There will be no blood on my hands here. It's your decision. Yes. I know nothing of it. You will 
wait until I've gone before doing whatever you must do. Yes. Well\'85 ah, yes. Yes. Good.\'94 
\par He fears the questioning of a Truthsayer, Jessica thought. Who? Ah-h-h, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen, of course! If he knows he must face her questions, then the Emperor is in on this for sure. Ah-h-h-h, my poor Leto.
\par With one last glance at Jessica, the Baron turned, went out the door. She followed him with her eyes, thinking: It's as the Reverend Mother warned\endash too potent an adversary.
\par Two Harkonnen troopers entered. Another, his face a scarred mask, followed and stood in the doorway with drawn lasgun.
\par The deaf one, Jessica thought, studying the scarred face. The Baron knows I could use the Voice on any other man.
\par Scarface looked at Piter. \'93We've the boy on a litter outside. What are your orders?\'94
\par Piter spoke to Jessica. \'93I'd thought of binding you by a threat held over your son, but I begin to see that would not have worked, I let emotion cloud reason. Bad policy for a Mentat.\'94 He looked at the first pair of troopers
, turning so the deaf one could read his lips: \'93Take them into the desert as the traitor suggested for the boy. His plan is a good one. The worms will destroy all evidence. Their bodies must never be found.\'94 
\par \'93You don't wish to dispatch them yourself?\'94 Scarface asked. 
\par He reads lips, Jessica thought.
\par \'93I follow my Baron's example,\'94 Piter said. \'93Take them where the traitor said.\'94
\par Jessica heard the harsh Mentat control in Piter's voice, thought: He, too, fears the Truthsayer.
\par Piter shrugged, turned, and went through the doorway. He hesitated there, and Jessica thought he might turn back for a last look at her, but he went out without turning.
\par \'93Me, I wouldn't like the thought of facing that Truthsayer after this night's work,\'94 Scarface said.
\par \'93You ain't likely ever to run into that old witch,\'94 one of the other troopers said. He went around to Jessica's head, bent over her. \'93It ain't getting our work done standing around here chattering. Take her feet and\endash \'94 
\par \'93Why'n't we kill \lquote em here?\'94 Scarface asked.
\par \'93Too messy,\'94 the first one said. \'93Unless you wants to strangle'em. Me, I likes a nice straightforward job. Drop \lquote em on the desert like that traitor said, cut \lquote em once or twice, leave \lquote 
the evidence for the worms. Nothing to clean up afterwards.\'94 
\par \'93Yeah\'85 well, I guess you're right,\'94 Scarface said.
\par Jessica listened to them, watching, registering. But the gag blocked her Voice, and there was the deaf one to consider.
\par Scarface holstered his lasgun, took her feet. They lifted her like a sack of grain, maneuvered her through t
he door and dumped her onto a suspensor-buoyed litter with another bound figure. As they turned her, fitting her to the litter, she saw her companion's face\endash 
Paul! He was bound, but not gagged. His face was no more than ten centimeters from hers, eyes closed, his breathing even. 
\par Is he drugged? she wondered.
\par The troopers lifted the litter, and Paul's eyes opened the smallest fraction\endash dark slits staring at her.
\par He mustn't try the Voice! she prayed. The deaf guard!
\par Paul's eyes closed.
\par He had been practicing th
e awareness-breathing, calming his mind, listening to their captors. The deaf one posed a problem, but Paul contained his despair. The mind-calming Bene Gesserit regimen his mother had taught him kept him poised, ready to expand any opportunity.
\par Paul allowed himself another slit-eyed inspection of his mother's face. She appeared unharmed. Gagged, though.
\par He wondered who could've captured her. His own captivity was plain enough\endash to bed with a capsule prescribed by Yueh, awaking to find himself bound to this l
itter. Perhaps a similar thing had befallen her. Logic said the traitor was Yueh, but he held final decision in abeyance. There was no understanding it\endash a Suk doctor a traitor.
\par The litter tipped slightly as the Harkonnen troopers maneuvered it through a doorway into starlit night. A suspensor-buoy rasped against the doorway. Then they were on sand, feet grating in it. A \lquote 
thopter wing loomed overhead, blotting the stars. The litter settled to the ground.
\par Paul's eyes adjusted to the faint light. He recognized the deaf trooper as the man who opened the \lquote thopter door, peered inside at the green gloom illuminated by the instrument panel.
\par \'93This the \lquote thopter we're supposed to use?\'94 he asked, and turned to watch his companion's lips.
\par \'93It's the one the traitor said was fixed for desert work,\'94 the other said.
\par Scarface nodded. \'93But it's one of them little liaison jobs. Ain't room in there for more'n them an\rquote  two of us.\'94
\par \'93Two's enough,\'94 said the litter-bearer, moving up close and presenting his lips for reading. \'93We can take care of it from here on, Kinet.\'94
\par \'93The Baron he told me to make sure what happened to them two,\'94 Scarface said.
\par \'93What you so worried about?\'94 asked another trooper from behind the litter-bearer.
\par \'93She is a Bene Gesserit witch,\'94 the deaf one said. \'93They have powers.\'94
\par \'93Ah-h-h\'85 \'94The litter-bearer made the sign of the fist at his ear. \'93One of them, eh? Know whatcha mean.\'94
\par The trooper behind him grunted. \'93She'll be worm meat soon enough. Don't suppose even a Bene Gesserit witch has powers over one of them big worms. Eh, Czigo?\'94 He nudged the litter-bearer.
\par \'93Yee-up,\'94 the litter-bearer said. He returned to the litter, took Jessica's shoulders. \'93C'mon, Kinet. You can go along if you wants to make sure what happens.\'94 
\par \'93It is nice of you to invite me, Czigo,\'94 Scarface said.
\par Jessica felt herself lifted, the wing shadow spinning\endash stars. She was pushed into the rear of the \lquote 
thopter, her krimskell fiber bindings examined, and she was strapped down. Paul was jammed in beside her, strapped securely, and she noted his bonds were simple rope.
\par Scarface, the deaf one they called Kinet, took his place in front. The litter-bearer, the one they called Czigo, came around and took the other front seat.
\par Kinet closed his door, bent to the controls. The \lquote thopter took off in a wing-tucked surge, headed south over the Shield Wall. Czigo tapped his companion's shoulder, said: \'93Whyn't you turn around and keep an eye on them two?\'94 
\par \'93Sure you know the way to go?\'94 Kinet watched Czigo's lips. 
\par \'93I listened to the traitor same's you.\'94
\par Kinet swiveled his seat. Jessica saw the glint of starlight on a lasgun in his hand. The \lquote 
thopter's light-walled interior seemed to collect illumination as her eyes adjusted, but the guard's scarred face remained dim. Jessica tested her seat belt, found it loose. She f
elt roughness in the strap against her left arm, realized the strap had been almost severed, would snap at a sudden jerk.
\par Has someone been at this \lquote thopter, preparing it for us? she wondered. Who? Slowly, she twisted her bound feet clear of Paul's.
\par \'93Sure do seem a shame to waste a good-looking woman like this,\'94 Scarface said. \'93You ever have any highborn types?\'94 He turned to look at the pilot.
\par \'93Bene Gesserit ain't all highborn,\'94 the pilot said. 
\par \'93But they all looks heighty.\'94
\par He can see me plain enough, Jessica thought. She brought her bound legs up onto the seat, curled into a sinuous ball, staring at Scarface.
\par \'93Real pretty, she is,\'94 Kinet said. He wet his lips with his tongue. \'93Sure do seem a shame.\'94 He looked at Czigo.
\par \'93You thinking what I think you're thinking?\'94 the pilot asked.
\par \'93Who'd be to know?\'94 the guard asked. \'93Afterwards\'85 \'94 He shrugged. \'93I just never had me no highborns. Might never get a chance like this one again.\'94
\par \'93You lay a hand on my mother\'85 \'94 Paul grated. He glared at Scarface.
\par \'93Hey!\'94 the pilot laughed. \'93Cub's got a bark. Ain't got no bite, though.\'94
\par And Jessica thought; Paul's pitching his voice too high. It may work, though.
\par They flew on in silence.
\par These poor fools, Jessica thought, studying her guards and reviewing the Baron's words. They'll be killed as soon as they report success on their mission. The Baron wants no witnesses.
\par The \lquote thopter banked over the southern rim of the Shield Wall, and Jessica saw a moonshadowed expanse of sand beneath them.
\par \'93This oughta be far enough,\'94 the pilot said. \'93The traitor said to put'em on the sand anywhere near the Shield Wall.\'94 He dipped the craft toward the dunes in a long, falling stoop, brought it up stiffly over the desert surface.
\par Jessica saw Paul begin taking the rhythmic breaths of the calming exercise. He closed his eyes, opened them. Jessica stared, helpless to aid him. He hasn't mastered the Voice yet, she thought, if he fails\'85 
\par The \lquote thopter touched sand with a soft lurch, and Jessica, looking north back across the Shield Wall, saw a shadow of wings settle out of sight up there.
\par Someone's following us! she thought. Who? Then: The ones the Baron set to watch this pair. And there'll be watchers for the watchers, too.
\par Czigo shut off his wing rotors. Silence flooded in upon them.
\par Jessica turned her head. She could see out the window beyond Scarface a dim glow of light from a rising moon, a frosted rim of rock rising from the desert. Sandblast ridges streaked its sides.
\par Paul cleared his throat.
\par The pilot said: \'93Now, Kinet?\'94 
\par \'93I dunno, Czigo.\'94
\par Czigo turned, said: \'93Ah-h-h, look.\'94 He reached out for Jessica's skirt.
\par \'93Remove her gag,\'94 Paul commanded.
\par Jessica felt the words rolling in the air. The tone, the timbre excellent\endash imperative, very sharp. A slightly lower pitch would have been better, but it could still fall within this man's spectrum.
\par Czigo shifted his hand up to the band around Jessica's mouth, slipped the knot on the gag. 
\par \'93Stop that!\'94 Kinet ordered.
\par \'93Ah, shut your trap,\'94 Czigo said. \'93Her hands're tied.\'94 He freed the knot and the binding dropped. His eyes glittered as he studied Jessica.
\par Kinet put a hand on the pilot's arm. \'93Look, Czigo, no need to\'85 \'94
\par Jessica twisted her neck, spat out the gag. She pitched her voice in low, intimate tones. \'93Gentlemen! No need to fight over me.\'94 At the same time, she writhed sinuously for Kinet's benefit.
\par She saw them grow tense, knowing that in this instant they were convinced of the need to fight over her. Their disagreement required no other reason. In their minds, they were fighting over her.
\par She held her face high in the instrument glow to be sure Kinet would read her lips, said: \'93You mustn't disagree.\'94 They drew farther apart, glanced warily at each other. \'93Is any woman worth fighting over?\'94 she asked.
\par By uttering the words, by being there, she made herself infinitely worth their fighting.
\par Paul clamped his lips tightly closed, forced himself to be silent. There had been the one chance for him to succeed with the Voice. Now\endash everything depended on his mother whose experience went so far beyond his own.
\par \'93Yeah,\'94 Scarface said. \'93No need to fight over\'85 \'94 
\par His hand flashed toward the pilot's neck. The blow was met by a splash of metal that caught the arm and in the same motion slammed into Kinet's chest.
\par Scarface groaned, sagged backward against his door.
\par \'93Thought I was some dummy didn't know that trick,\'94 Czigo said. He brought back his hand, revealing the knife. It glittered in reflected moonlight.
\par \'93Now for the cub,\'94 he said and leaned toward Paul. 
\par \'93No need for that,\'94 Jessica murmured. 
\par Czigo hesitated.
\par \'93Wouldn't you rather have me cooperative?\'94 Jessica asked. \'93Give the boy a chance.\'94 Her lip curled in a sneer. \'93Little enough chance he'd have out there in that sand. Give him that and\'85 \'94 She smiled. \'93
You could find yourself well rewarded.\'94 
\par Czigo glanced left, right, returned his attention to Jessica. \'93I've heard me what can happen to a man in this desert,\'94 he said. \'93Boy might find the knife a kindness.\'94
\par \'93Is it so much I ask?\'94 Jessica pleaded. 
\par \'93You're trying to trick me,\'94 Czigo muttered.
\par \'93I don't want to see my son die,\'94 Jessica said. \'93Is that a trick?\'94 
\par Czigo moved back, elbowed the door latch. He grabbed Paul, dragged him across the seat, pushed him half out the door and held the knife posed. \'93What'll y\rquote  do, cub, if I cut y'r bonds?\'94 
\par \'93He'll leave here immediately and head for those rocks,\'94 Jessica said.
\par \'93Is that what y'll do, cub?\'94 Czigo asked. 
\par Paul's voice was properly surly. \'93Yes.\'94
\par The knife moved down, slashed the bindings of his legs. Paul felt the hand on his back to hurl him down onto the sand, feigned a lurch against the doorframe for purchase, turned as though to catch himself, lashed out with his right foot.
\par The toe was aimed with a precision that did credit to his long years of training, as though all of that training focused on this instant. Almost every muscle of 
his body cooperated in the placement of it. The tip struck the soft part of Czigo's abdomen just below the sternum, slammed upward with terrible force over the liver and through the diaphragm to crush the right ventricle of the man's heart.
\par With one gurgli
ng scream, the guard jerked backward across the seats. Paul, unable to use his hands, continued his tumble onto the sand, landing with a roll that took up the force and brought him back to his feet in one motion. He dove back into the cabin, found the kni
fe and held it in his teeth while his mother sawed her bonds. She took the blade and freed his hands.
\par \'93I could've handled him,\'94 she said. \'93He'd have had to cut my bindings. That was a foolish risk.\'94 
\par \'93I saw the opening and used it,\'94 he said.
\par She heard the harsh control in his voice, said: \'93Yueh's house sign is scrawled on the ceiling of this cabin.\'94 
\par He looked up, saw the curling symbol.
\par \'93Get out and let us study this craft,\'94 she said. \'93There's a bundle under the pilot's seat. I felt it when we got in.\'94 
\par \'93Bomb?\'94 
\par \'93Doubt it. There's something peculiar here.\'94
\par Paul leaped out to the sand and Jessica followed. She turned, reached under the seat for the strange bundle, seeing Czigo's feet close to her face, feeling dampness on the bundle as she removed it, realizing the dampness was the pilot's blood.
\par Waste of moisture, she thought, knowing that this was Arrakeen thinking.
\par Paul stared around them, saw the rock scarp lifting out of the desert like a beach rising from the sea, wind-carved palisades beyond. He turned back as his mother lifted the bundle from the \lquote 
thopter, saw her stare across the dunes toward the Shield Wall. He looked to see what drew her attention, saw another \lquote thopter swooping toward them, realized they'd not have time to clear the bodies out of this \lquote thopter and escape.
\par \'93Run, Paul!\'94 Jessica shouted. \'93It's Harkonnens!\'94

\par 
\par A man in Harkonnen uniform skidded to a stop at the end of the hall, stared in at Yueh, taking in at a single glance Mapes\rquote  body, the sprawled form of the Duke, Yueh standing there. The man held a lasgun in his right hand. There was a casual ai
r of brutality about him, a sense of toughness and poise that sent a shiver through Yueh.
\par Sardaukar, Yueh thought. A Bashar by the look of him. Probably one of the Emperor's own sent here to keep an eye on things. No matter what the uniform, there's no disguising them.
\par \'93You're Yueh,\'94 the man said. He looked speculatively at the Suk School ring on the Doctor's hair, stared once at the diamond tattoo and then met Yueh's eyes. 
\par \'93I am Yueh,\'94 the Doctor said.
\par \'93You can relax, Yueh,\'94 the man said. \'93When you dropped the house shields we came right in. Everything's under control here. Is this the Duke?\'94 
\par \'93This is the Duke.\'94 
\par \'93Dead?\'94 
\par \'93Merely unconscious. I suggest you tie him.\'94
\par \'93Did you do for these others?\'94 He glanced back down the hall where Mapes\rquote  body lay.
\par \'93More's the pity,\'94 Yueh muttered.
\par \'93Pity!\'94 the Sardaukar sneered. He advanced, looked down at Leto. \'93So that's the great Red Duke.\'94
\par If I had doubts about what this man is, that would end them, Yueh thought. Only the Emperor calls the Atreides the Red Duke.
\par The Sardaukar reached down, cut the red hawk insignia from Leto's uniform. \'93Little souvenir,\'94 he said. \'93Where's the ducal signet ring?\'94 
\par \'93He doesn't have it on him,\'94 Yueh said. 
\par \'93I can see that!\'94 the Sardaukar snapped.
\par Yueh stiffened, swallowed, if they press me, bring in a Truthsayer, they'll find out about the ring, about the \lquote thopter I prepared\endash all will fail.
\par \'93Sometimes the Duke sent the ring with a messenger as surety that an order came directly from him,\'94 Yueh said. 
\par \'93Must be damned trusted messengers,\'94 the Sardaukar muttered. 
\par \'93Aren't you going to tie him?\'94 Yueh ventured. 
\par \'93How long'll he be unconscious?\'94
\par \'93Two hours or so. I wasn't as precise with his dosage as I was for the woman and boy.\'94
\par The Sardaukar spurned the Duke with his toe. \'93This was nothing to fear even when awake. When will the woman and boy awaken?\'94 
\par \'93About ten minutes.\'94 
\par \'93So soon?\'94
\par \'93I was told the Baron would arrive immediately behind his men.\'94
\par \'93So he will. You'll wait outside, Yueh.\'94 He shot a hard glance at Yueh. \'93Now!\'94 
\par Yueh glanced at Leto. \'93What about\'85 \'94
\par \'93He'll be delivered to the Baron all properly trussed like a roast for the oven.\'94 Again, the Sardaukar looked at the diamond tattoo on Yueh's forehead. \'93You're known; you'll be safe enough in the halls. We've no more time for chit-chat, tra
itor. I hear the others coming.\'94
\par Traitor, Yueh thought. He lowered his gaze, pressed past the Sardaukar, knowing this as a foretaste of how history would remember him: Yueh the traitor.
\par He passed more bodies on his way to the front entrance and glanced at them, fearful that one might be Paul or Jessica. All were house troopers or wore Harkonnen uniform.
\par Harkonnen guards came alert, staring at him as he emerged from the front entrance into flame-lighted night. The palms along the road had been fired to illum
inate the house. Black smoke from the flammables used to ignite the trees poured upward through orange flames.
\par \'93It's the traitor,\'94 someone said.
\par \'93The Baron will want to see you soon,\'94 another said.
\par I must get to the \lquote thopter, Yueh thought. I must put the ducal signet where Paul will find it. And fear struck him: If Idaho suspects me or grows impatient\endash if he doesn't wait and go exactly where I told him\endash 
Jessica and Paul will not be saved from the carnage. I'll be denied even the smallest relief from my act.
\par The Harkonnen guard released his arm, said \'93Wait over there out of the way.\'94
\par Abruptly, Yueh saw himself as cast away in this place of destruction, spared nothing, given not the smallest pity. Idaho must not fail!
\par Another guard bumped into him, barked: \'93Stay out of the way, you!\'94
\par Even when they've profited by me they despise me. Yueh thought. He straightened himself as he was pushed aside, regained some of his dignity.
\par \'93Wait for the Baron!\'94 a guard officer snarled.
\par Yueh nodded, walked with controlled casualness along the front of the house, turned the corner into shadows out of sight of the burning palms. Quickly, every step betraying his anxiety, Yueh made for the rear yard beneath the conservatory where the 
\lquote thopter waited\endash the craft they had placed there to carry away Paul and his mother.
\par A guard stood at the open rear door of the house, his attention focused on the lighted hall and men banging through there, searching from room to room. 
\par How confident they were!
\par Yueh hugged the shadows, worked his way around the \lquote 
thopter, eased open the door on the side away from the guard. He felt under the front seats for the Fremkit he had hidden there, lifted a flap and slipped in the ducal signet. He felt the crinkling of the spice paper there, the note he had written, p
ressed the ring into the paper. He removed his hand, resealed the pack.
\par Softly, Yueh closed the \lquote thopter door, worked his way back to the corner of the house and around toward the flaming trees. 
\par Now, it is done, he thought.
\par Once more, he emerged into the light of the blazing palms. He pulled his cloak around him, stared at the flames. Soon I will know. Soon I will see the Baron and I will know. And the Baron\endash he will encounter a small tooth.
\par 
\par 
\par There is a legend that the instant the Duke Leto Atreides died a meteor streaked across the skies above his ancestral palace on Caladan.
\par -the Princess Irulan: \'93Introduction to A Child's History of Muad'Dib\'94
\par 
\par The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood at a viewport of the grounded lighter he was using as a command post. Out the port he saw the flame-lighted night of Arrakeen. His attention focused on the distant Shield Wall where his secret weapon was doing its work. 

\par Explosive artillery.
\par The guns nibbled at the caves where the Duke's fighting men had retreated for a last-ditch stand. Slowly measured bites of orange glare, showers of rock and dust in the brief illumination\endash 
and the Duke's men were being sealed off to die by starvation, caught like animals in their burrows.
\par The Baron could feel the distant chomping\endash a drumbeat carried to him through the ship's metal: broomp\'85 broomp. Then: BROOMP-broomp!
\par Who would think of reviving artillery in this day of shields? The thought was a chuckle in his mind. But it was predictable the Duke's men would run for those caves. And the Emperor 
will appreciate my cleverness in preserving the lives of our mutual force.
\par He adjusted one of the little suspensors that guarded his fat body against the pull of gravity. A smile creased his mouth, pulled at the lines of his jowls.
\par A pity to waste such fig
hting men as the Duke's, he thought. He smiled more broadly, laughing at himself. Pity should be cruel! He nodded. Failure was, by definition, expendable. The whole universe sat there, open to the man who could make the right decisions. The uncertain rabb
its had to be exposed, made to run for their burrows. Else how could you control them and breed them? He pictured his fighting men as bees routing the rabbits. And he thought: The day hums sweetly when you have enough bees working for you.
\par A door opened behind him. The Baron studied the reflection in the night-blackened viewport before turning.
\par Piter de Vries advanced into the chamber followed by Umman Kudu, the captain of the Baron's personal guard. There was a motion of men just outside the door, the mutton faces of his guard, their expressions carefully sheep-like in his presence.
\par The Baron turned.
\par Piter touched finger to forelock in his mocking salute. \'93Good news, m'Lord. The Sardaukar have brought in the Duke.\'94 
\par \'93Of course they have,\'94 the Baron rumbled.
\par He studied the somber mask of villainy on Piter's effeminate face. And the eyes: those shaded slits of bluest blue-in-blue.
\par Soon I mast remove him, the Baron thought. He has almost outlasted his usefulness, almost reached the point of positive danger to my person. First, though, he must make the people of Arrakis hate him. Then\endash 
they will welcome my darling Feyd-Rautha as a savior.
\par The Baron shifted his attention to the guard captain\endash Umman Kudu: scissors-line of jaw muscles, chin like a boot toe\endash a man to be trusted because the captain's vices were known.
\par \'93First, where is the traitor who gave me the Duke?\'94 the Baron asked. \'93I must give the traitor his reward.\'94 
\par Piter turned on one toe, motioned to the guard outside.
\par A bit of black movement there and Yueh walke
d through. His motions were stiff and stringy. The mustache drooped beside his purple lips. Only the old eyes seemed alive. Yueh came to a stop three paces into the room, obeying a motion from Piter, and stood there staring across the open space at the Ba
ron. 
\par \'93Ah-h-h, Dr. Yueh.\'94 
\par \'93M'Lord Harkonnen.\'94 
\par \'93You've given us the Duke, I hear.\'94 
\par \'93My half of the bargain, m'Lord.\'94 
\par The Baron looked at Piter. 
\par Piter nodded.
\par The Baron looked back at Yueh. \'93The letter of the bargain, eh? And I\'85\'94 He spat the words out: \'93What was I to do in return?\'94 
\par \'93You remember quite well, m'Lord Harkonnen.\'94 
\par And Yueh allowed himself to think now, hearing the loud silence of clocks in his mind. He had seen the subtle betrayals in the Baron's manner. Wanna was indeed dead\endash gone far beyond
 their reach. Otherwise, there'd still be a hold on the weak doctor. The Baron's manner showed there was no hold; it was ended. 
\par \'93Do I?\'94 the Baron asked. 
\par \'93You promised to deliver my Wanna from her agony.\'94 
\par The Baron nodded. \'93Oh, yes. Now, I remember. So I
 did. That was my promise. That was how we bent the Imperial Conditioning. You couldn't endure seeing your Bene Gesserit witch grovel in Piter's pain amplifiers. Well, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen always keeps his promises. I told you I'd free her from th
e agony and permit you to join her. So be it.\'94 He waved a hand at Piter.
\par Piter's blue eyes took a glazed look. His movement was catlike in its sudden fluidity. The knife in his hand glistened like a claw as it flashed into Yueh's back.
\par The old man stiffened, never taking his attention from the Baron. 
\par \'93So join her!\'94 the Baron spat.
\par Yueh stood, swaying, His lips moved with careful precision, and his voice came in oddly measured cadence: \'93You\'85 think\'85 you\'85 de\'85 feated\'85 me. You\'85 think\'85 I\'85 did\'85 not\'85 know\'85 what\'85 I\'85 bought\'85 for\'85 my\'85 Wanna.
\'94 
\par He toppled. No bending or softening. It was like a tree falling. 
\par \'93So join her,\'94 the Baron repeated. But his words were like a weak echo.
\par Yueh had filled him with a sense of foreboding. He whipped his attention to Piter, watched the man wipe the blade on a scrap of cloth, watched the creamy look of satisfaction in the blue eyes.
\par So that's how he kills by his own hand, the Baron thought. It's well to know.
\par \'93He did give us the Duke?\'94 the Baron asked. 
\par \'93Of a certainty, my Lord,\'94 Piter said. 
\par \'93Then get him in here!\'94 
\par Piter glanced at the guard captain, who whirled to obey.
\par The Baron looked down at Yueh. From the way the man had fallen, you could suspect oak in him instead of bones.
\par \'93I never could bring myself to trust a traitor,\'94 the Baron said. \'93Not even a traitor I created.\'94
\par He glanced at the night-shrouded viewport. That black bag of stillness out there was his, the Baron knew. There was no more crump of artillery against the Shield Wall caves; the burrow traps were sealed off. Quite
 suddenly, the Baron's mind could conceive of nothing more beautiful than that utter emptiness of black. Unless it were white on the black. Plated white on the black. Porcelain white.
\par But there was still the feeling of doubt.
\par What had the old fool of a doctor meant? Of course, he'd probably known what would happen to him in the end. But that bit about thinking he'd been defeated: \'93You think you defeated me.\'94 
\par What had he meant?
\par The Duke Leto Atreides came through the door. His arms were bound in chains, the
 eagle face streaked with dirt. His uniform was torn where someone had ripped off his insignia. There were tatters at his waist where the shield belt had been removed without first freeing the uniform ties. The Duke's eyes held a glazed, insane look.

\par \'93Wel-l-l-l,\'94 the Baron said. He hesitated, drawing in a deep breath. He knew he had spoken too loudly. This moment, long envisioned, had lost some of its savor. 
\par Damn that cursed doctor through all eternity!
\par \'93I believe the good Duke is drugged,\'94 Piter said. \'93That's how Yueh caught him for us.\'94 Piter turned to the Duke. \'93Aren't you drugged, my dear Duke?\'94
\par The voice was far away. Leto could feel the chains, the ache of muscles, his cracked lips, his burning cheeks, the dry taste of thirst whispering its grit in hi
s mouth. But sounds were dull, hidden by a cottony blanket. And he saw only dim shapes through the blanket.
\par \'93What of the woman and the boy, Piter?\'94 the Baron asked. \'93Any word yet?\'94 
\par Piter's tongue darted over his lips.
\par \'93You've heard something!\'94 the Baron snapped. \'93What?\'94 
\par Piter glanced at the guard captain, back to the Baron. \'93The men who were sent to do the job, m'Lord\endash they've\'85 ah\'85 been\'85 ah\'85 found.\'94 
\par \'93Well, they report everything satisfactory?\'94 
\par \'93They're dead, m'Lord.\'94 
\par \'93Of course they are! What I want to know is\endash \'94 
\par \'93They were dead when found, m'Lord.\'94 
\par The Baron's face went livid. \'93And the woman and boy?\'94 
\par \'93No sign, m'Lord, but there was a worm. It came while the scene was being investigated. Perhaps it's as we wished\endash an accident. Possibly\endash \'94
\par \'93We do not deal in possibilities, Piter. What of the missing \lquote thopter? Does that suggest anything to my Mentat?\'94 
\par \'93One of the Duke's men obviously escaped in it, m'Lord. Killed our pilot and escaped.\'94 
\par \'93Which of the Duke's men?\'94
\par \'93It was a clean, silent killing, m'Lord. Hawat, perhaps, or that Halleck one. Possibly Idaho. Or any top lieutenant.\'94 
\par \'93Possibilities,\'94 the Baron muttered. He glanced at the swaying, drugged figure of the Duke.
\par \'93The situation is in hand, m'Lord,\'94 Piter said.
\par \'93No, it isn't! Where is that stupid planetologist? Where is this man Kynes?\'94
\par \'93We've word where to find him and he's been sent for, m'Lord.\'94
\par \'93I don't like the way the Emperor's servant is helping us,\'94 the Baron muttered.
\par They were words through a cottony blanket, but some of them burned in Leto's mind. Woman and boy\endash no sign. Paul and Jessica had escaped. And the fate of Hawat, Halleck, and Idaho remained an unknown. There was still hope.
\par \'93Where is the ducal signet ring?\'94 the Baron demanded. \'93His finger is bare.\'94
\par \'93The Sardaukar say it was not on him when he was taken, my Lord,\'94 the guard captain said.
\par \'93You killed the doctor too soon,\'94 the Baron said. \'93That was a mistake. You should've warned me, Piter. You moved too precipitately for the good of our enterprise.\'94 He scowled. \'93Possibilities!\'94
\par The thought hung like a sine wave in Leto's mind: Paul and Jessica have escaped! And there was something else in his memory: a bargain. He could almost remember it. 
\par The tooth!
\par He remembered part of it now: a pill of poison gas shaped into a false tooth.
\par Someone had told him to remember the tooth. The tooth was in his mouth. He could feel its shape with his tongue. All he had to do was bite sharply on it. 
\par Not yet!
\par The someone had told him to wait until he was near the Baron. Who had told him? He couldn't remember.
\par \'93How long will he remain drugged like this?\'94 the Baron asked. 
\par \'93Perhaps another hour, m'Lord.\'94
\par \'93Perhaps,\'94 the Baron muttered. Again, he turned to the night-blackened window. \'93I am hungry.\'94
\par That's the Baron, that fuzzy gray shape there, Leto thought. The shape danced back and forth, swaying with the movement of the room. And the room expanded and contracted. It grew brighter and darker. It folded into blackness and faded.
\par Time became a sequence of layers for the Duke. He drifted up through them. I must wait.
\par There was a table. Leto saw the table quite clearly. And a gross, fat man on the other side of the table, the remains of a meal in front of him. Leto felt himself sitting in a chair across from the fat man, felt the chains, the straps that held his tin
gling body in the chair. He was aware there had been a passage of time, but its length escaped him.
\par \'93I believe he's coming around. Baron.\'94 
\par A silky voice, that one. That was Piter. 
\par \'93So I see, Piter.\'94 
\par A rumbling basso: the Baron.
\par Leto sensed increasing definition in his surroundings. The chair beneath him took on firmness, the bindings were sharper.
\par And he saw the Baron clearly now. Leto watched the movements of the man's hands: compulsive touchings\endash the edge of a plate, the handle of a spoon, a finger tracing the fold of a jowl. 
\par Leto watched the moving hand, fascinated by it.
\par \'93You can hear me, Duke Leto,\'94 the Baron said. \'93I know you can hear me. We want to know from you where to find your concubine and the child you sired on her.\'94
\par No sign escaped Leto, but the words were a wash of calmness through him. It's true, then: they don't have Paul and Jessica.
\par \'93This is not a child's game we play,\'94 the Baron rumbled. \'93You must know that.\'94 He leaned toward Leto, studying the face. It pained the Baron that this could 
not be handled privately, just between the two of them. To have others see royalty in such straits\endash it set a bad precedent.
\par Leto could feel strength returning. And now, the memory of the false tooth stood out in his mind like a steeple in a flat landscape. The nerve-shaped capsule within that tooth\endash the poison gas\endash 
he remembered who had put the deadly weapon in his mouth.  
\par Yueh.
\par Drug-fogged memory of seeing a limp corpse dragged past him in this room hung like a vapor in Leto's mind. He knew it had been Yueh.
\par \'93Do you hear that noise, Duke Leto?\'94 the Baron asked.
\par Leto grew conscious of a frog sound, the burred mewling of someone's agony.
\par \'93We caught one of your men disguised as a Fremen, \'93 the Baron said. \'93We penetrated the disguise quite easily: the eyes, you k
now. He insists he was sent among the Fremen to spy on them. I've lived for a time on this planet, cher cousin. One does not spy on those ragged scum of the desert. Tell me, did you buy their help? Did you send your woman and son to them?\'94
\par Leto felt fear tighten his chest. If Yueh sent them to the desert fold\'85 the search won't stop until they \lquote re found.
\par \'93Come, come,\'94 the Baron said. \'93We don't have much time and pain is quick. Please don't bring it to this, my dear Duke.\'94 The Baron looked up at Piter who stood at Leto's shoulder. \'93
Piter doesn't have all his tools here, but I'm sure he could improvise.\'94
\par \'93Improvisation is sometimes the best, Baron.\'94 
\par That silky, insinuating voice! Leto heard it at his ear.
\par \'93You had an emergency plan,\'94 the Baron said. \'93Where have your woman and the boy been sent?\'94 He looked at Leto's hand. \'93Your ring is missing. Does the boy have it?\'94 
\par The Baron looked up, stared into Leto's eyes.
\par \'93You don't answer,\'94 he said. \'93Will you force me to do a thing I do not want to do? Piter will use simple, direct methods. I agree they're sometimes the best, but it's not good that you should be subjected to such things.\'94
\par \'93Hot tallow on the back, perhaps, or on the eyelids,\'94 Piter said. \'93Perhaps on other portions of the body. It's especially effective wh
en the subject doesn't know where the tallow will fall next. It's a good method and there's a sort of beauty in the pattern of pus-white blisters on naked skin, eh,  Baron?\'94 
\par \'93Exquisite,\'94 the Baron said, and his voice sounded sour.
\par Those touching fingers! Leto watched the fat hands, the glittering jewels on baby-fat hands\endash their compulsive wandering.
\par The sounds of agony coming through the door behind him gnawed at the Duke's nerves. Who is it they caught? he wondered. Could it have been Idaho?
\par \'93Believe me, cher cousin,\'94 the Baron said. \'93I do not want it to come to this.\'94
\par \'93You think of nerve couriers racing to summon help that cannot come,\'94 Piter said. \'93There's an artistry in this, you know.\'94 
\par \'93You're a superb artist,\'94 the Baron growled. \'93Now, have the decency to be silent.\'94
\par Leto suddenly recalled a thing Gurney Halleck had said once, seeing a picture of the Baron: \'93 \lquote And I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea\'85 and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.\rquote  \'93
\par \'93We waste time, Baron,\'94 Piter said. 
\par \'93Perhaps.\'94
\par The Baron nodded. \'93You know, my dear Leto, you'll tell us in the end where they are. There's a level of pain that'll buy you.\'94 
\par He's most likely correct, Leto thought. Were if not for the tooth\'85 and the fact that I truly don't know where they are.
\par The Baron picked up a sliver of meat, pressed the morsel into his mouth, chewed slowly, swallowed. We must try a new tack, he thought.
\par \'93Observe this prize person who denies he's for hire,\'94 the Baron said. \'93Observe him, Piter.\'94
\par And the Baro
n thought: Yes! See him there, this man who believes he cannot be bought. See him detained there by a million shares of himself sold in dribbles every second of his life! If you took him up now and shook him, he'd rattle inside. Emptied! Sold out! What di
fference how he dies now?
\par The frog sounds in the background stopped.
\par The Baron saw Umman Kudu, the guard captain, appear in the doorway across the room, shake his head. The captive hadn't produced the needed information. Another failure. Time to quit stalli
ng with this fool Duke, this stupid soft fool who didn't realize how much hell there was so near him\endash only a nerve's thickness away.
\par This thought calmed the Baron, overcoming his reluctance to have a royal person subject to pain. He saw himself suddenly as a surgeon exercising endless supple scissor dissections\endash cutting away the masks from fools, exposing the hell beneath. 

\par Rabbits, all of them!
\par And how they cowered when they saw the carnivore!
\par Leto stared across the table, wondering why he waited. The tooth would end it all quickly. Still\endash 
it had been good, much of this life. He found himself remembering an antenna kite updangling in the shell-blue sky of Caladan, and Paul laughing with joy at the sight of it. And he remembered sunrise here on Arrakis\endash colored 
strata of the Shield Wall mellowed by dust haze.
\par \'93Too bad,\'94 the Baron muttered. He pushed himself back from the table, stood up lightly in his suspensors and hesitated, seeing a change come over the Duke. He saw the man draw in a deep breath, the jawline s
tiffen, the ripple of a muscle there as the Duke clamped his mouth shut.
\par How he fears me! the Baron thought.
\par Shocked by fear that the Baron might escape him, Leto bit sharply on the capsule tooth, felt it break. He opened his mouth, expelled the biting vap
or he could taste as it formed on his tongue. The Baron grew smaller, a figure seen in a tightening tunnel. Leto heard a gasp beside his ear\endash the silky-voiced one: Piter. 
\par It got him, too!
\par \'93Piter! What's wrong?\'94 
\par The rumbling voice was far away.
\par Leto sensed memories rolling in his mind\endash the old toothless mutterings of hags. The room, the table, the Baron, a pair of terrified eyes\endash blue within blue, the eyes\endash all compressed around him in ruined symmetry.
\par There was a man with a boot-toe chin, a toy man falling. The toy man had a broken nose slanted to the left: an offbeat metronome caught forever at the start of an upward stroke. Leto heard the crash of crockery\endash so distant\endash 
a roaring in his ears. His mind was a bin without end, catching everything. Everything that had ever been: every shout, every whisper, every\'85 silence.
\par One thought remained to him. Leto saw it in formless light on rays of black: The day the flesh shapes and the flesh the day shapes. The thought struck him with a sense of fullness he knew he could never explain. 
\par Silence.
\par The Baron stood with his back against his private door, his own bolt hole behind the table. He had slammed it on a room full of dead men. His senses took in guards swarming around him. Did I breathe it? he asked himself. Whatever i
t was in there, did it get me, too?
\par Sounds returned to him\'85 and reason. He heard someone shouting orders\endash gas masks\'85 keep a door closed\'85 get blowers going.
\par The others fell quickly, he thought. I'm still standing. I'm still breathing. Merciless hell! That was close!
\par He could analyze it now. His shield had been activated, set low but still enough to slow molecular interchange across the field barrier. And he had been pushing himself away from the table\'85 that and Piter's shocked gasp which had brought the guard
 captain darting forward into his own doom.
\par Chance and the warning in a dying man's gasp\endash these had saved him.
\par The Baron felt no gratitude to Piter. The fool had got himself killed. And that stupid guard captain! He'd said he scoped everyone before bringing them into the Baron's presence! How had it been possible for the Duke\'85
 ? No warning. Not even from the poison snooper over the table\endash until it was too late. How?
\par Well, no matter now, the Baron thought, his mind firming. The next guard captain will begin by finding answers to these questions.
\par He grew aware of more activity down the hall\endash around the corner at the other door to that room of death. The Baron pushed himself away from his own door, studied the lackeys around him. They stood there staring, silent, 
waiting for the Baron's reaction. 
\par Would the Baron be angry?
\par And the Baron realized only a few seconds had passed since his flight from that terrible room.
\par Some of the guards had weapons leveled at the door. Some were directing their ferocity toward the empty hall that stretched away toward the noises around the corner to their right.
\par A man came striding around that corner, gas mask dangling by its straps at his neck, his eyes intent on the overhead poison snoopers that lined this corridor. He was yellow-ha
ired, flat of face with green eyes. Crisp lines radiated from his thick-lipped mouth. He looked like some water creature misplaced among those who walked the land.
\par The Baron stared at the approaching man, recalling the name: Nefud. Iakin Nefud. Guard corporal. Nefud was addicted to semuta, the drug-music combination that played itself in the deepest consciousness. A useful item of information, that.
\par The man stopped in front of the Baron, saluted. \'93Corridor's clear, m'Lord. I was outside watching and saw that it must be poison gas. Ventilators in your room were pulling air in from these corridors.\'94
 He glanced up at the snooper over the Baron's head. \'93None of the stuff escaped. We have the room cleaned out now. What are your orders?\'94
\par The Baron recognized the man's voice\endash the one who'd been shouting orders. Efficient, this corporal, he thought. 
\par \'93They're all dead in there?\'94 the Baron asked. 
\par \'93Yes, m'Lord.\'94 
\par Well, we must adjust, the Baron thought.
\par \'93First,\'94 he said, \'93let me congratulate you, Nefud. You're the new captain of my guard. And I hope you'll take to heart the lesson to be learned from the fate of your predecessor.\'94
\par The Baron watched the awareness grow in his newly promoted guardsman. Nefud knew he'd never again be without his semuta.
\par Nefud nodded. \'93My Lord knows I'll devote myself entirely to his safety.\'94
\par \'93Yes. Well, to business. I suspect the Duke had something in his mouth. You will find out what that something was, how it was used, who helped him put it there. You'll take every precaution\endash \'94 
\par He broke off, his chain of thought shattered by a disturbance in the corridor behind him\endash guards at the door to the lift from the lower levels of the frigate trying to hold back a tall colonel bashar who had just emerged from the lift.
\par The Baron couldn't place the colonel bashar's face: thin with mouth like a slash in leather, twin ink spots for eyes.
\par \'93Get your hands off me, you pack of carrion-eaters!\'94 the man roared, and he dashed the guards aside. 
\par Ah-h-h, one of the Sardaukar, the Baron thought.
\par The colonel bashar came striding toward the Baron, whose eyes went to slits of apprehension. The Sardaukar officers filled him with unease. They all seemed to look like relatives of the Duke\'85 the late Duke. And their manners with the Baron!
\par The colonel bashar planted himself half a pace in front of the Baron, hands on hips. The guard hovered behind him in twitching uncertainty.
\par The Baron noted the absence of salute, the disdain in the Sardaukar's manner, and his unease grew. There was only the one legion of them locally\endash ten brigades\endash 
reinforcing the Harkonnen legions, but the Baron did not fool himself. That one legion was perfectly capable of turning on the Harkonnens and overcoming them.
\par \'93Tell your men they are not to prevent me from seeing you, Baron,\'94 the Sardaukar growled. \'93My men brought you the Atreides Duke before I could discuss his fate with you. We will discuss it now.\'94 
\par I must not lose face before my men, the Baron thought.
\par \'93So?\'94 It was a coldly controlled word, and the Baron felt proud of it.
\par \'93My Emperor has charged me to make certain his royal cousin dies cleanly without agony,\'94 the colonel bashar said.
\par \'93Such were the Imperial orders to me,\'94 the Baron lied. \'93Did you think I'd disobey?\'94
\par \'93I'm to report to my Emperor what I see with my own eyes,\'94 the Sardaukar said.
\par \'93The Duke's already dead,\'94 the Baron snapped, and he waved a hand to dismiss the fellow.
\par The colonel bashar remained planted facing the Baron. Not by flicker of eye or muscle did he acknowledge he had been dismissed. \'93How?\'94 he growled.
\par Really! the Baron thought. This is too much.
\par \'93By his own hand, if you must know,\'94 the Baron said. \'93He took poison.\'94 
\par \'93I will see the body now,\'94 the colonel Bashar said.
\par The Baron raised his gaze to the ceiling in feigned exasperation while his thoughts raced. Damnation! This sharp-eyed Sardaukar will see the room before a thing's been changed! 
\par \'93Now,\'94 the Sardaukar growled. \'93I'll see it with my own eyes.\'94 
\par There was no preventing it, the Baron realized. The Sardaukar would see all. He'd know the Duke had killed Harkonnen men\'85 th
at the Baron most likely had escaped by a narrow margin. There was the evidence of the dinner remnants on the table, and the dead Duke across from it with destruction around him. 
\par No preventing it at all.
\par \'93I'll not be put off,\'94 the colonel bashar snarled. 
\par \'93You're not being put off,\'94 the Baron said, and he stared into the Sardaukar's obsidian eyes. \'93I hide nothing from my Emperor.\'94 He nodded to Nefud. \'93
The colonel bashar is to see everything, at once. Take him in by the door where you stood, Nefud.\'94 
\par \'93This way, sir,\'94 Nefud said.
\par Slowly, insolently, the Sardaukar moved around the Baron, shouldered a way through the guardsmen.
\par Insufferable, the Baron thought. Now, the Emperor will know how I slipped up. He'll recognize it as a sign of weakness.
\par And it was agon
izing to realize that the Emperor and his Sardaukar were alike in their disdain for weakness. The Baron chewed at his lower lip, consoling himself that the Emperor, at least, had not learned of the Atreides raid on Giedi Prime, the destruction of the Hark
onnen spice stores there. 
\par Damn that slippery Duke!
\par The Baron watched the retreating backs\endash the arrogant Sardaukar and the stocky, efficient Nefud.
\par We must adjust, the Baron thought. I'll have to put Rabban over this damnable planet once more. Without restra
int. I must spend my own Harkonnen blood to put Arrakis into a proper condition for accepting Feyd-Rautha. Damn that Piter! He would get himself killed before I was through with him.
\par The Baron sighed.
\par And I must send at once to Tleielax for a new Mentat. They undoubtedly have the new one ready for me by now. 
\par One of the guardsmen beside him coughed. 
\par The Baron turned toward the man. \'93I am hungry.\'94 
\par \'93Yes, m'Lord.\'94
\par \'93And I wish to be diverted while you're clearing out that room and studying its secrets for me,\'94 the Baron rumbled.
\par The guardsman lowered his eyes. \'93What diversion does m'Lord wish?\'94
\par \'93I'll be in my sleeping chambers,\'94 the Baron said. \'93Bring me that young fellow we bought on Gamont, the one with the lovely eyes. Drug him well. I don't feel like wrestling.\'94 
\par \'93Yes, m'Lord.\'94
\par The Baron turned away, began moving with his bouncing, suspensor-buoyed pace toward his chambers. Yes, he thought. The one with the lovely eyes, the one who looks so much like the young Paul Atreides.

\par -from \'93Songs of Muad'Dib\'94 by the Princess Irulan
\par 
\par Paul felt that all his past, every experience before this night, had become sand curling in an hourglass. He sat near his mother hugging his knees within a small fabric and plastic hutment\endash a stilltent\endash 
that had come, like the Fremen clothing they now wore, from the pack left in the \lquote thopter.
\par There was no doubt in Paul's mind who had put the Fremkit there, who had directed the course of the \lquote thopter carrying them captive. 
\par Yueh.
\par The traitor doctor had sent them directly into the hands of Duncan Idaho.
\par Paul stared out the transparent end of the stilltent at the moonshadowed rocks that ringed this place where Idaho had hidden them.
\par Hiding like a child when I'm now the Duke, Paul thought. He felt the thought gall him, but could not deny the wisdom in what they did.
\par Something had happened to his awareness this night\endash he saw with sharpened clarity every circumstance and occurrence around him. He felt unable to sto
p the inflow of data or the cold precision with which each new item was added to his knowledge and the computation was centered in his awareness. It was Mentat power and more.
\par Paul thought back to the moment of impotent rage as the strange \lquote thopter dived out of the night onto them, stooping like a giant hawk above the desert with wind screaming through its wings. The thing in Paul's mind had happened then. The \lquote 
thopter had skidded and slewed across a sand ridge toward the running figures\endash his mother and himself. Paul remembered how the smell of burned sulfur from abrasion of \lquote thopter skids against sand had drifted across them.
\par His mother, he knew, had turned, expected to meet a lasgun in the hands of Harkonnen mercenaries, and had recognized Duncan Idaho leaning out the \lquote thopter's open door shouting: \'93Hurry! There's wormsign south of you!\'94
\par But Paul had known as he turned who piloted the \lquote thopter. An accumulation of minutiae in the way it was flown, the dash of the landing\endash clues so small even his mother hadn't detected them\endash 
had told Paul precisely who sat at those controls.
\par Across the stilltent from Paul, Jessica stirred, said: \'93There can be only one explanation. The Harkonnens held Yueh's wife. He hated the Harkonnens! I cannot be wrong about that. You read his note. But why has he saved us from the carnage?\'94 
\par She is only now seeing it and that poorly, Paul thought. The thought was a shock. He had known this fact as a by-the-way thing while reading the note that had accompanied the ducal signet in the pack.
\par \'93Do not try to forgive me,\'94 Yueh had written. \'93
I do not want your forgiveness. I already have enough burdens. What I have done was done without malice or hope of another's understanding. It is my own tahaddi al-burhan, my ultimate test. I give you the Atreides
 ducal signet as token that I write truly. By the time you read this, Duke Leto will be dead. Take consolation from my assurance that he did not die alone, that one we hate above all others died with him.\'94
\par It had not been addressed or signed, but there \lquote d been no mistaking the familiar scrawl\endash Yueh's.
\par Remembering the letter, Paul re-experienced the distress of that moment\endash a thing sharp and strange that seemed to happen outside his new mentat alertness. He had read that his father was dead, known the truth of
 the words, but had felt them as no more than another datum to be entered in his mind and used.
\par I loved my father, Paul thought, and knew this for truth. I should mourn him. I should feel something.
\par But he felt nothing except: Here's an important fact. 
\par It was one with all the other facts.
\par All the while his mind was adding sense impressions, extrapolating, computing.
\par Halleck's words came back to Paul: \'93Mood's a thing for cattle or for making love. You fight when the necessity arises, no matter your mood. \'93
\par Perhaps that's it, Paul thought. I'll mourn my father later\'85 when there's time.
\par But he felt no letup in the cold precision of his being. He sensed that his new awareness was only a beginning, that it was growing. The sense of terrible purpose he'd first ex
perienced in his ordeal with the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam pervaded him. His right hand\endash the hand of remembered pain\endash tingled and throbbed.
\par Is this what it is to be their Kwisatz Haderach? he wondered.
\par \'93For a while, I thought Hawat had failed us again, \'93Jessica said. \'93I thought perhaps Yueh wasn't a Suk doctor.\'94
\par \'93He was everything we thought him\'85 and more,\'94 Paul said. And he thought: Why is she so slow seeing these things? He said, \'93If Idaho doesn't get through to Kynes, we'll be\endash \'94 
\par \'93He's not our only hope,\'94 she said. 
\par \'93Such was not my suggestion,\'94 he said.
\par She heard the steel in his voice, the sense of command, and stared across the grey darkness of the stilltent at him. Paul was a silhouette against moon-frosted rocks seen through the tent's transparent end.
\par \'93Others among your father's men will have escaped,\'94 she said. \'93We must regather them, find\endash \'94
\par \'93We will depend upon ourselves,\'94 he said. \'93Our immediate concern is our family atomics. We must get them before the Harkonnens can search them out.\'94
\par \'93Not likely they'll be found,\'94 she said, \'93the way they were hidden.\'94 
\par \'93It must not be left to chance.\'94
\par And she thought: Blackmail with the family atomics as a threat to the planet and its spice\endash that's what he has in mind. But all he can hope for then is escape into renegade anonymity.
\par His mother's words had provoked another train of thought in Paul\endash a duke's concern for all the people they'd lost this night. People are the true strength of a Great House, Paul thought. And he remembered Hawat's words: \'93Parting wi
th people is a sadness; a place is only a place.\'94
\par \'93They're using Sardaukar,\'94 Jessica said. \'93We must wait until the Sardaukar have been withdrawn.\'94
\par \'93They think us caught between the desert and the Sardaukar,\'94 Paul said. \'93They intend that there be no Atreides survivors\endash total extermination. Do not count on any of our people escaping.\'94 
\par \'93They cannot go on indefinitely risking exposure of the Emperor's part in this.\'94 
\par \'93Can't they?\'94 
\par \'93Some of our people are bound to escape.\'94 
\par \'93Are they?\'94
\par Jessica turned away, frig
htened of the bitter strength in her son's voice, hearing the precise assessment of chances. She sensed that his mind had leaped ahead of her, that it now saw more in some respects than she did. She had helped train the intelligence which did this, but no
w she found herself fearful of it. Her thoughts turned, seeking toward the lost sanctuary of her Duke, and tears burned her eyes.
\par This is the way it had to be, Leto, she thought. \'93A time of love and a time of grief.\'94 She rested her hand on her abdomen, awar
eness focused on the embryo there. I have the Atreides daughter I was ordered to produce, but the Reverend Mother was wrong: a daughter wouldn't have saved my Leto. This child is only life reaching for the future in the midst of death. I conceived out of 
instinct and not out of obedience.
\par \'93Try the communinet receiver again,\'94 Paul said.
\par The mind goes on working no matter how we try to hold it back, she thought.
\par Jessica found the tiny receiver Idaho had left for them, flipped its switch. A green light glowed 
on the instrument's face. Tinny screeching came from its speaker. She reduced the volume, hunted across the bands. A voice speaking Atreides battle language came into the tent.
\par \'93\'85 back and regroup at the ridge. Fedor reports no survivors in Carthag and the Guild Bank has been sacked.\'94
\par Carthag! Jessica thought. That was a Harkonnen hotbed.
\par \'93They're Sardaukar,\'94 the voice said. \'93Watch out for Sardaukar in Atreides uniforms. They're\'85 \'94 
\par A roaring filled the speaker, then silence. 
\par \'93Try the other bands,\'94 Paul said.
\par \'93Do you realize what that means?\'94 Jessica asked.
\par \'93I expected it. They want the Guild to blame us for destruction of their bank. With the Guild against us, we're trapped on Arrakis. Try the other bands.\'94
\par She weighed his words: I expected it. What had happened to him? Slowly, Jessica returned to the instrument. As she moved the bandslide, they caught glimpses of violence in the few voices calling out in Atreides battle language: \'93\'85 fallback\'85 \'94 
\'93\'85 try to regroup at\'85 \'94 \'93\'85 trapped in a cave at\'85 .\'94 
\par And there was no mistaking the victorious exultation in the Harkonnen gibberish that poured from the other bands. Sharp commands, battle reports. There wasn't enough of it for Jessica to register and break the language, but the tone was obvious. 
\par Harkonnen victory.
\par Paul shook the pack beside him, hearing the two literjons of water gurgle there. He took a deep breath, looked up through the transparent end of the tent at the rock escarpment outlined against the stars. His left hand felt the sphincter-seal of the tent'
s entrance. \'93It'll be dawn soon,\'94 he said. \'93We can wait through the day for Idaho, but not through another night. In the desert, you must travel by night and rest in shade through the day.\'94
\par Remembered lore insinuated itself into Jessica's mind: Without a s
tillsuit, a man sitting in shade on the desert needs five liters of water a day to maintain body weight. She felt the slick-soft skin of the stillsuit against her body, thinking how their lives depended on these garments.
\par \'93If we leave here, Idaho can't find us,\'94 she said.
\par \'93There are ways to make any man talk,\'94 he said. \'93If Idaho hasn't returned by dawn, we must consider the possibility he has been captured. How long do you think he could hold out?\'94 
\par The question required no answer, and she sat in silence.
\par Paul lifted the seal on the pack, pulled out a tiny micromanual with glowtab and magnifier. Green and orange letters leaped up at him from the pages: \'93
literjons, stilltent, energy caps, recaths, sandsnork, binoculars, stillsuit repkit, baradye pistol, sinkchart, filt-plugs, paracompass, maker hooks, thumpers, Fremkit, fire pillar\'85 \'94 
\par So many things for survival on the desert. 
\par Presently, he put the manual aside on the tent floor. 
\par \'93Where can we possibly go?\'94 Jessica asked.
\par \'93My father spoke of desert power,\'94 Paul said. \'93The Harkonnens cannot rule this planet without it. They've never ruled this planet, nor shall they. Not even with ten thousand legions of Sardaukar.\'94 
\par \'93Paul, you can't think that\endash \'94
\par \'93We've all the evidence in our hands,\'94 he said. \'93Right here in this tent\endash the tent itself, this pack and its contents, these stillsuits. We know the Guild wants a prohibitive price for weather satellites. We know that\endash \'94
\par \'93What've weather satellites to do with it?\'94 she asked. \'93They couldn't possibly\'85 \'94 She broke off.
\par Paul sensed the hyperalertness of his mind reading her reactions, computing on minutiae. \'93You see it now,\'94 he said. \'93Satellites watch the terrain below. There are things in the deep desert that will not bear frequent inspection.\'94 
\par \'93You're suggesting the Guild itself controls this planet?\'94 
\par She was so slow.
\par \'93No!\'94 he said. \'93The Fremen! They're paying the Guild for privacy, paying in a coin that's freely available to anyone with desert power\endash spice. This is more than a second-approximation answer; it's the straigh
t-line computation. Depend on it.\'94
\par \'93Paul.\'94 Jessica said, \'93you're not a Mentat yet; you can't know for sure how\endash \'94
\par \'93I'll never be a Mentat,\'94 he said. \'93I'm something else\'85 a freak.\'94 
\par \'93Paul! How can you say such\endash \'94 
\par \'93Leave me alone!\'94
\par He turned away from her, looking out into the night. Why can't I mourn? he wondered. He felt that every fiber of his being craved this release, but it would be denied him forever.
\par Jessica had never heard such distress in her son's voice. She wanted to reach out to him, hold him, comfort him, help him\endash but she sensed there was nothing she could do. He had to solve this problem by himself.
\par The glowing tab of the Fremkit manual between them on the tent floor caught her eye. She lifted it, glanced at the flyleaf, reading: \'93Manual of \lquote The Friendly Desert,\rquote 
 the place full of life. Here are the ayat and burhan of Life. Believe, and al-Lat shall never burn you.\'94
\par It reads like the Azhar Book, she thought, recalling her studies of the Great Secrets. Has a Manipulator of Religions been on Arrakis?
\par Paul lifted the paracompass from the pack, returned it, said: \'93Think of all these special-application Fremen machines. They show unrivaled sophistication. Admit it. The culture that made these things betrays depths no one suspected.\'94
\par Hesitating, still worried by the harshness in his voice, Jessica returned to the book, studied an illustrated constellation from the Arrakeen sky: \'93Muad'Dib: The Mouse,\'94 and noted that the tail pointed north.
\par Paul stared into the tent's darkness at the dimly discerned movemen
ts of his mother revealed by the manual's glowtab. Now is the time to carry out my father's wish, he thought. I must give her his message now while she has time for grief. Grief would inconvenience us later. And he found himself shocked by precise logic. 

\par \'93Mother,\'94 he said. 
\par \'93Yes?\'94
\par She heard the change in his voice, felt coldness in her entrails at the sound. Never had she heard such harsh control. 
\par \'93My father is dead,\'94 he said.
\par She searched within herself for the coupling of fact and fact and fact\endash the Bene Gesserit way of assessing data\endash and it came to her: the sensation of terrifying loss. 
\par Jessica nodded, unable to speak.
\par \'93My father charged me once,\'94 Paul said, \'93to give you a message if anything happened to him. He feared you might believe he distrusted you.\'94 
\par That useless suspicion, she thought.
\par \'93He wanted you to know he never suspected you,\'94 Paul said, and explained the deception, adding: \'93He wanted you to know he always trusted you completely, always loved you and cherished you. He said he would sooner h
ave mistrusted himself and he had but one regret\endash that he never made you his Duchess.\'94 
\par She brushed the tears coursing down her cheeks, thought: What a stupid waste of the body's water! But she knew this thought for what it was\endash the attempt to retreat from g
rief into anger. Leto, my Leto, she thought. What terrible things we do to those we love! With a violent motion, she extinguished the little manual's glowtab. 
\par Sobs shook her.
\par Paul heard his mother's grief and felt the emptiness within himself. I have no grief, he thought. Why? Why? He felt the inability to grieve as a terrible flaw.
\par \'93A time to get and time to lose,\'94 Jessica thought, quoting to herself from the O.C. Bible. \'93A time to keep and a time to cast away; a time for love and a time to hate; a time of war and a time of peace. \'93
\par Paul's mind had gone on in its chilling precision. He saw the avenues ahead of them on this hostile planet. Without even the safety valve of dreaming, he focused his prescient awareness, seeing it as a computation of most proba
ble futures, but with something more, an edge of mystery\endash as though his mind dipped into some timeless stratum and sampled the winds of the future.
\par Abruptly, as though he had found a necessary key, Paul's mind climbed another notch in awareness. He felt him
self clinging to this new level, clutching at a precarious hold and peering about. It was as though he existed within a globe with avenues radiating away in all directions\'85 yet this only approximated the sensation.
\par He remembered once seeing a gauze kerchief blowing in the wind and now he sensed the future as though it twisted across some surface as undulant and impermanent as that of the windblown kerchief.
\par He saw people.
\par He felt the heat and cold of uncounted probabilities.
\par He knew names and places, experienced emotions without number, reviewed data of innumerable unexplored crannies. There was time to probe and test and taste, but no time to shape.
\par The thing was a spectrum of possibilities from the most remote past to the most remote future\endash from the most probable to the most improbable. He saw his own death in countless ways. He saw new planets, new cultures. 
\par People. 
\par People.
\par He saw them in such swarms they could not be listed, yet his mind catalogued them.
\par Even the Guildsmen.
\par And he thought: The Guild\endash there\rquote  d be a way for us, my strangeness accepted as a familiar thing of high value, always with an assured supply of the now-necessary spice.
\par But the idea of living out his life in the mind-groping-ahead-through-possible-futures that guided hurtling spaceships appalled him. It was a way, though. And in meeting the possible future that contained Guildsmen he recognized his own strangeness.

\par I have another kind of sight. I see another kind of terrain: the available paths.
\par The awareness conveyed both reassurance and alarm\endash so many places on that other kind of terrain dipped or turned out of his sight.
\par As swiftly as it had come, the sensation slipped away from him, and he realized the entire experience had taken the space of a heartbeat.
\par Yet, his own personal awareness had been turned over, illuminated in a terrifying way. He stared around him.
\par Night still covered the stilltent within its rock-enclosed hideaway. His mother's grief could still be heard.
\par His own lack of grief could still be felt\'85 that hollow place somewhere separated from his mind, which went on in its steady pace\endash dealing with data, evaluating, computing, submitting answers in something like the Mentat way.
\par And now he saw that he had a wealth of data few such minds ever before had encompassed. But this 
made the empty place within him no easier to bear. He felt that something must shatter. It was as though a clockwork control for a bomb had been set to ticking within him. It went on about its business no matter what he wanted. It recorded minuscule shadi
ngs of difference around him\endash 
a slight change in moisture, a fractional fall in temperature, the progress of an insect across their stilltent roof, the solemn approach of dawn in the starlighted patch of sky he could see out the tent's transparent end.
\par The emptiness was unbearable. Knowing how the clockwork had been set in motion made no difference. He could look to his own past and see the start of it\endash 
the training, the sharpening of talents, the refined pressures of sophisticated disciplines, even exposure to the O.C. Bible at a critical moment\'85 and, lastly, the heavy intake of spice. And he could look ahead\endash the most terrifying direction
\endash to see where it all pointed. 
\par I'm a monster! he thought. A freak! 
\par \'93No,\'94 he said. Then: \'93No. No! NO!\'94
\par He found that he was pounding the tent floor with his fists. (The implacable part of him recorded this as an interesting emotional datum and fed it into computation.) 
\par \'93Paul!\'94
\par His mother was beside him, holding his hands, her face a gray blob peering at him. \'93Paul, what's wrong?\'94 
\par \'93You!\'94 he said.
\par \'93I'm here, Paul,\'94 she said. \'93It's all right.\'94 
\par \'93What have you done to me?\'94 he demanded.
\par In a burst of clarity, she sensed some of the roots in the question, said: \'93I gave birth to you.\'94
\par It was, from instinct as much as her own subtle k
nowledge, the precisely correct answer to calm him. He felt her hands holding him, focused on the dim outline of her face. (Certain gene traces in her facial structure were noted in the new way by his onflowing mind, the clues added to other data, and a f
inal-summation answer put forward.) 
\par \'93Let go of me,\'94 he said.
\par She heard the iron in his voice, obeyed. \'93Do you want to tell me what's wrong, Paul?\'94
\par \'93Did you know what you were doing when you trained me?\'94 he asked.
\par There's no more childhood in his voice, she thought. And she said: \'93I hoped the thing any parent hopes\endash that you'd be\'85 superior, different.\'94 
\par \'93Different?\'94 
\par She heard the bitterness in his tone, said: \'93Paul, I\endash \'94 
\par \'93You didn't want a son!\'94 he said. \'93You wanted a Kwisatz Haderach! You wanted a male Bene Gesserit!\'94 
\par She recoiled from his bitterness. \'93But Paul\'85\'94 
\par \'93Did you ever consult my father in this?\'94
\par She spoke gently out of the freshness of her grief: \'93Whatever you are, Paul, the heredity is as much your father as me.\'94 
\par \'93But not the training,\'94 he said. \'93Not the things that\'85 awakened\'85 the sleeper.\'94 
\par \'93Sleeper?\'94
\par \'93It's here.\'94 He put a hand to his head and then to his breast. \'93In me. It goes on and on and on and on and\endash \'94
\par \'93Paul!\'94 
\par She had heard the hysteria edging his voice.
\par \'93Listen to me,\'94 he said. \'93You wanted the Reverend Mother to hear about my dreams: You listen in her place now. I've just had a waking dream. Do you know why?\'94 
\par \'93You must calm yourself,\'94 she said. \'93If there's\endash \'94 
\par \'93The spice,\'94 he said, \'93It's in everything here\endash the air, the soil, the food. The geriatric spice. It's like the Truthsayer drug. It's a poison!\'94 
\par She stiffened.
\par His voice lowered and he repeated: \'93A poison\endash so subtle, so insidious\'85 so irreversible. It won't even kill you unless you stop taking it. We can't leave Arrakis unless we take part of Arrakis with us.\'94 
\par The terrifying presence of his voice brooked no dispute.
\par \'93You and the spice,\'94 Paul said. \'93The spice changes anyone who gets this much of it, but thanks to you, I could bring the change to consciousness. I don't get to leave it in the unconscious where its disturbance can be blanked out. I can see it.
\'94 
\par \'93Paul, you\endash \'94 
\par \'93I see it!\'94 he repeated.
\par She heard madness in his voice, didn't know what to do.
\par But he spoke again, and she heard the iron control return to him: \'93We're trapped here.\'94 
\par We're trapped here, she agreed.
\par And she accepted the truth of his words. No pressure of the Bene Gesserit, no trickery or artifice could pry them completely free from Arrakis: the spice was addictive. Her body had known the fact long before her mind awakened to it.
\par So here we live out our lives, she thought, on this hell-planet. The place is prepared for us, if we can evade the Harkonnens. And there's no doubt of my course: a broodmare preserving an important bloodline for the Bene Gesserit Plan.
\par \'93I must tell you about my waking dream,\'94 Paul said. (Now there was fury in his voice.) \'93To be sure you accept what I say, I'll tell you first I know you'll bear a daughter, my sister, here on Arrakis.\'94 
\par Jessica placed her hands against the tent floor, pressed bac
k against the curving fabric wall to still a pang of fear. She knew her pregnancy could not show yet. Only her own Bene Gesserit training had allowed her to read the first faint signals of her body, to know of the embryo only a few weeks old.
\par \'93Only to serve,\'94 Jessica whispered, clinging to the Bene Gesserit motto. \'93We exist only to serve.\'94
\par \'93We'll find a home among the Fremen,\'94 Paul said, \'93where your Missionaria Protectiva has bought us a bolt hole.\'94 
\par They've prepared a way for us in the desert, Jessica told herself. But how can he know of the Missionaria Protectiva? She found it increasingly difficult to subdue her terror at the overpowering strangeness in Paul.
\par He studied the dark shadow of her, seeing her fear and every reaction with his new awareness as though she were outlined in blinding light. A beginning of compassion for her crept over him.
\par \'93The things that can happen here, I cannot begin to tell you,\'94 he said. \'93I cannot even begin to tell myself, although I've seen them. This sense of the future\endash I seem to have no control over it. The thing just happens. The immediate future
\endash say, a year\endash I can see some of that\'85 a road as broad as our Central Avenue on Caladan. Some places I don't see\'85 shadowed places\'85 as though it went behind a hill\'94 (and again he thought of the surface of a blowing kerchief) \'93
\'85 and there are branchings\'85 \'94
\par He fell silent as memory of that seeing filled him. No prescient dream, no experience of his life had quite prepared him for the totality with which the veils had been ripped away to reveal naked time.
\par Recalling the experience, he recognized his own terrible purpose\endash the pressure of his life spreading outward like an expanding bubble\'85 time retreating before it\'85 
\par Jessica found the tent's glowtab control, activated it.
\par Dim green light drove back the shadows, easing her fear. She looked at Paul's face, his eyes\endash the inward stare. And she knew where she had seen such a look before: pictured in records of disasters\endash 
on the faces of children who experienced starvation or terrible injury. The eyes were like pits, mouth a straight line, cheeks indrawn.
\par It's the look of terrible awareness, she thought, of someone forced to the knowledge of his own mortality. 
\par He was, indeed, no longer a child.
\par The underlying import of his words began to take over in her mind, pushing all else aside. Paul could see ahead, a way of escape for them.
\par \'93There's a way to evade the Harkonnens,\'94 she said.
\par \'93The Harkonnens!\'94 he sneered. \'93Put those twisted humans out of your mind.\'94 He stared at his mother, studying the lines of her face in the light of the glowtab. The lines betrayed her. 
\par She said: \'93You shouldn't refer to people as humans without\endash \'94 
\par \'93Don't be so sure you know where to draw the line,\'94 he said. \'93We carry our past with us. And, mother mine, there's a thing you don't know and should\endash we are Harkonnens.\'94
\par Her mind did a terrifying thing: it blanked out as though it needed to shut off all sensation. But Paul's voice went on at that implacable pace, dragging her with it.
\par \'93When next you find a mirror, study your face\endash study 
mine now. The traces are there if you don't blind yourself. Look at my hands, the set of my bones. And if none of this convinces you, then take my word for it. I've walked the future, I've looked at a record, I've seen a place, I have all the data. We're 
Harkonnens.\'94 
\par \'93A\'85 renegade branch of the family,\'94 she said. \'93That's it, isn't it? Some Harkonnen cousin who\endash \'94
\par \'93You're the Baron's own daughter,\'94 he said, and watched the way she pressed her hands to her mouth. \'93The Baron sampled many pleasures in his youth,
 and once permitted himself to be seduced. But it was for the genetic purposes of the Bene Gesserit, by one of you.\'94
\par The way he said \lquote you\rquote  struck her like a slap. But it set her mind to working and she could not deny his words. So many blank ends of meaning in her past reached out now and linked. The daughter the Bene Gesserit wanted\endash 
it wasn't to end the old Atreides-Harkonnen feud, but to fix some genetic factor in their lines. What? She groped for an answer.
\par As though he saw inside her mind, Paul said: \'93They thought they were reaching for me. But I'm not what they expected, and I've arrived before my time. And they don't know it.\'94 
\par Jessica pressed her hands to her mouth. 
\par Great Mother! He's the Kwisatz Haderach!
\par She felt exposed and naked before him, realizing then that he saw her with eyes from which little could be hidden. And that, she knew, was the basis of her fear.
\par \'93You're thinking I'm the Kwisatz Haderach,\'94 he said. \'93Put that out of your mind. I'm something unexpected.\'94
\par I must get word out to one of the schools, she thought. The mating index may show what has happened.
\par \'93They won't learn about me until it's too late,\'94 he said.
\par She sought to divert him, lowered her hands and said: \'93We'll find a place among the Fremen?\'94
\par \'93The Fremen have a saying they credit to Shai-hulud, Old Father Eternity,\'94 he said. \'93They say: \lquote Be prepared to appreciate what you meet.\rquote  \'93
\par And he thought: Yes, mother mine\endash among the Fremen. You'll acquire the blue eyes and a callus beside your lovely nose from the filter tube to your stillsuit\'85 and you'll bear my sister: St. Alia of the Knife.
\par \'93If you're not the Kwisatz Haderach,\'94 Jessica said, \'93what\endash \'94 
\par \'93You couldn't possibly know,\'94 he said. \'93You won't believe it until you see it.\'94 
\par And he thought: I'm a seed.
\par He suddenly saw how fertile was the ground into which he had fallen, and with this realization, the terrible purpose filled him, creeping through the empty place within, threatening to choke him with grief.
\par He had seen two main branchings along the way ahead\endash in one he confronted an evil old Baron and said: \'93Hello, Grandfather.\'94 The thought of that path and what lay along it sickened him.
\par The other path held long patches of grey obscurity except for peaks of violence. He had seen a warrior religion there, a fire spreading across the uni
verse with the Atreides green and black banner waving at the head of fanatic legions drunk on spice liquor. Gurney Halleck and a few others of his father's men\endash a pitiful few\endash 
were among them, all marked by the hawk symbol from the shrine of his father's skull.
\par \'93I can't go that way,\'94 he muttered. \'93That's what the old witches of your schools really want.\'94 
\par \'93I don't understand you, Paul,\'94 his mother said.
\par He remained silent, thinking like the seed he was, thinking with the race consciousness he had first experi
enced as terrible purpose. He found that he no longer could hate the Bene Gesserit or the Emperor or even the Harkonnens. They were all caught up in the need of their race to renew its scattered inheritance, to cross and mingle and infuse their bloodlines
 in a great new pooling of genes. And the race knew only one sure way for this\endash the ancient way, the tried and certain way that rolled over everything in its path: jihad. 
\par Surely, I cannot choose that way, he thought.
\par But he saw again in his mind's eye the shrine of his father's skull and the violence with the green and black banner waving in its midst.
\par Jessica cleared her throat, worried by his silence. \'93Then\'85 the Fremen will give us sanctuary?\'94
\par He looked up, staring across the green-lighted tent at the inbred, patrician lines of her face. \'93Yes,\'94 he said. \'93That's one of the ways.\'94 He nodded. \'93Yes. They'll call me\'85 Muad'Dib, \lquote The One Who Points the Way.\rquote  Yes\'85
 that's what they'll call me.\'94 
\par And he closed his eyes, thinking: Now, my father, I can mourn you. And he felt the tears coursing down his cheeks.
