\par The Harkonnen space yacht left the family-held industries on Hagal and crossed the interstellar gulf toward Salusa Secundus. The streamlined vessel flew silently, in contrast to the fusillade of angry shouts inside the cockpit. 
\par Stern, hard-line Ulf Harkonnen piloted the yacht, concentrating on the hazards of space 
and the constant threat of thinking machines, though he kept lecturing his twenty-one-year-old son, Piers. Ulf's wife, Katarina, too gentle a soul to be worthy of the Harkonnen name, asserted that the quarrel had gone on long enough. "Further criticism an
d shouting will serve no purpose, Ulf." 
\par Vehemently, the elder Harkonnen disagreed. 
\par Piers sat fuming, unrepentant; he was not cut out for the cutthroat practices his noble family expected, no matter how much his father tried to bully him into them. He knew
 Ulf would browbeat and humiliate him all the way home. The gruff older man refused to consider that his son's ideas for more humane methods might actually be more efficient than the inflexible, domineering ways. 
\par Clutching the ship controls with a death grip, Ulf growled at his son, }{\i\f44\fs28\lang1033\langfe1049\langnp1033\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609 "Thinking machines}{\f44\fs28\lang1033\langfe1049\langnp1033\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609 
 are efficient. Humans, especially riffraff like our slaves on Hagal, are meant to be used. I doubt you'll ever get that through your skull." He shook his large, squarish head. "Sometimes, Piers, I think I sho
uld clean up the gene pool by eliminating you." 
\par "Then why don't you?" Piers snapped, defiant. His father believed in forceful decisions, every question with a black-or-white answer, and that belittling his son would drive him to do better. 
\par "I can't, beca
use your brother, Xavier, is too young to be the Harkonnen heir, so you're the only choice I have . . . for the time being. I keep hoping you'll understand your responsibility to our family. You're a noble, meant to command, not to show the workers how so
ft you can be." 
\par Katarina pleaded, "Ulf, you may not agree with the changes Piers made on Hagal, but at least he thought it through and was trying a new process. Given time it might have led to improved productivity." 
\par "And meanwhile the Harkonnen family go
es bankrupt?" Ulf held a thick finger toward his son as if it were a weapon. "Piers, those people took terrible advantage of you, and you're lucky I arrived in time to stop the damage. When I provide you with detailed instructions on how our family holdin
gs are to be run, I do not expect you to come up with a 'better' idea." 
\par "Is your mind so fossilized that you can't accept new ideas?" Piers asked. 
\par "Your instincts are faulty, and you have a very na\bullet ve view of human nature." Ulf shook his head, growling in
 disappointment. "He takes after you, Katarina-that's his main problem." Like his mother, Piers had a narrow face, full lips, and a delicate expression . . . quite different from Ulf's shaggy gray hair framing a blunt-featured face. "You would have been a
 better poet than a Harkonnen." 
\par That was meant to be a grave insult, but Piers secretly agreed. The young man had always enjoyed reading histories of the Old Empire, days of decadence and ennui before the thinking machines had conquered many civilized sola
r systems. Piers would have fit into those times well as a writer, a storyteller. 
\par "I gave you an opportunity, son, hoping that I could depend on you. But I have my answer." The elder Harkonnen stood, clenching his large, callused fists. "This whole trip has been a waste." 
\par Katarina caressed her husband's broad back, trying to calm him. "Ulf, we're passing near the Caladan system. You talked about stopping there to investigate the possibility of new holdings . . . maybe fishing operations?" 
\par Ulf hunched his
 shoulders. "All right, we'll divert to Caladan and take a look." He snapped his head up. "But in the meantime, I want this disgrace of a son sealed in the lifepod chamber. It's the closest thing to a brig onboard. He needs to learn his lesson, take his r
esponsibilities seriously, or he will never be a true Harkonnen."

As he sulked inside his improvised cell, with its cream-colored walls and silver instrument panels, Piers stared out the small porthole. He hated arguments with his stubborn father. Th
e rigid old ways of the Harkonnen family were not always best. Instead of imposing tough conditions and harsh punishments, why not try treating workers with respect? 
\par }{\i\f44\fs28\lang1033\langfe1049\langnp1033\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609 Workers. }{\f44\fs28\lang1033\langfe1049\langnp1033\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609 He remembered how his father had reacted to the word. "Next you'll want to call 
them employees. They are }{\i\f44\fs28\lang1033\langfe1049\langnp1033\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609 slaves!" }{\f44\fs28\lang1033\langfe1049\langnp1033\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609 
Ulf had thundered as they stood in the overseer's office back on Hagal. "They have no rights." 
\par "But they deserve rights," Piers responded. "They're human beings, not machines." 
\par Ulf had barely contained his violence. "Perhaps I should beat you the way my father beat me, pounding contrition and responsibility into you. This isn't a game. You're leaving now, boy. Get on the ship." 
\par Like a scolded child, Piers had done as he was commanded. . . . 
\par He wished he could stand toe to toe with his father, just once. Every time he tried, though, Ulf made him feel that he had let the family down, as if he were a shirker who would waste their hard-won fortunes. 
\par His father had entrusted him to manage the family holdings on Hagal, groomi
ng him as the next head of the Harkonnen businesses. This assignment had been an important step for Piers, with complete authority over the sheet diamond operations. A chance, a test. The implicit understanding was that he would operate the mines as they 
had always been run. 
\par Harkonnens held the mining rights to all sheet diamonds on sparsely populated Hagal. The largest mine filled an entire canyon. Piers recalled how sunlight played off the glassy cliffs, dancing on the prismatic surfaces. He had never se
en anything so beautiful. 
\par The cliff faces were diamond sheets with blue-green quartz marking the perimeters like irregular picture frames. Human-operated mining machines crawled along the cliffs like fat, silver insects: no artificial intelligence, and th
erefore considered safe. History had shown that even the most innocuous types of AI could ultimately turn against humans. Entire star systems were now under the control of diabolically smart machines, and in those dark sectors of the universe, human slave
s followed the commands of mechanized masters. 
\par At optimal spots on the shimmering cliffs, the mining machines would lock onto the surface with suction devices and separate the diamond material with sound waves at natural points of fissure. Holding diamond 
sheets in their grasp, the dumb machines would make their way back down the cliff to loading areas. 
\par It was an efficient process, but sometimes the sonic cutting procedure shattered the diamond sheets. Though once Piers gave the slaves a stake in the profi
ts, such mishaps occurred much less frequently, as if they took greater care when they received a vested interest. 
\par Overseeing the Hagal operation, Piers had come up with the idea of letting the captive gangs work without typical Harkonnen regulations and 
close oversight. While some slaves accepted the incentive program, a number of problems did surface. With reduced supervision, some slaves ran away; others were disorganized or lazy, just waiting for someone to tell them what to do. Initially, productivit
y dropped, but he was sure the output would eventually meet, and even exceed, previous levels. 
\par Before that could happen, though, his father had made an unannounced visit to Hagal. And Ulf Harkonnen wasn't interested in creative ideas or humanitarian improvements if profits were down. . . . 
\par His parents had been forced to leave their younger son, Xavier, on Salusa with a pleasant old-school couple. "I shudder to think how the boy will turn out if }{\i\f44\fs28\lang1033\langfe1049\langnp1033\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609 they}{

\par Eavesdropping, Piers knew why his manipulative father had left his little brother with the Tantors. Since the aging couple was childless, wily Ulf was working his way into their good graces. He hoped the Tantors might eventually leave their estate 
to their dear "godson" Xavier. 
\par Piers hated the way his father used people, whether they were slaves, other nobles, or members of his own family. It was disgusting. But now, trapped inside the cramped lifepod chamber, he could do nothing about it.

rogramming made the thinking machines relentless and determined, but only the cruelty of a human mind could generate enough ruthless hatred to feed a war of extermination for a thousand years. 
\par Though they were kept in reluctant thrall by the pervasive com
puter mind Omnius, the cymeks-hybrid machines with human minds-often bided their time by hunting between the stars. They would capture feral humans and bring them back to slavery on the Synchronized Worlds, or just kill them for sport. . . . 
\par The leader of
 the cymeks, a general who had taken the imposing name of Agamemnon, had once led the group of tyrants that conquered the decaying Old Empire. As implacable soldiers in the cause, the tyrants had reprogrammed the subservient robots and computers to give t
hem a thirst for conquest. When his mortal human body grew old and weak, Agamemnon had undergone a surgical process that removed his brain and implanted it within a preservation canister that he could install into various mechanical bodies. 
\par Agamemnon and h
is fellow tyrants had intended to rule for centuries . . . but then the artificially aggressive computers stepped into power when they saw the chance, exploiting the tyrants' lack of diligence. The Omnius network then ruled the remnants of the Old Empire,
 subjugating the cymek tyrants along with the rest of already-downtrodden humanity. 
\par For centuries, Agamemnon and his fellow conquerors had been forced to serve the computer evermind with no chance of regaining their own rule. Their greatest source of amuse
ment was in tracking down stray humans who had managed to maintain their independence from machine domination. Still, the cymek general found it a most unsatisfactory venting of his frustrations. 
\par His brain canister had been installed inside a fast scout v
essel that patrolled areas known to be inhabited by League humans. Six cymeks accompanied the general as their ships skirted the edge of a small solar system. They found little of interest, only one human-compatible world composed of mostly water. 
\par Then Agamemnon's long-range sensors spotted another vessel. A }{\i\f44\fs28\lang1033\langfe1049\langnp1033\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609 human}{\f44\fs28\lang1033\langfe1049\langnp1033\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609  vessel. 
\par He increased resolution and pointed out the target to his companions. Triangulating with their combined detection abilities, Agamemnon discerned that the lone ship was a small space yach
t, its sophisticated configuration and style implying that its passengers were important members of the League, rich merchants . . . perhaps even smug nobles, the most gratifying victims of all. 
\par "Just what we've been waiting for," said Agamemnon. 
\par The cym
ek ships adjusted course and accelerated. Connected through thoughtrodes, Agamemnon's brain flew his ship-body as if it were a large bird of prey, zeroing in on his helpless target. He also had a terrestrial walker stored aboard, a warrior form that could
 be used for planetary combat. 
\par The first cymek shots took the League vessel completely by surprise. The doomed human pilot barely had time to take evasive maneuvers. Kinetic projectiles scraped the hull, pounding one of the engines, but the ship's defensiv
e armor protected it against severe damage. Cymek ships swept past, strafing again with explosive projectiles, and the human yacht reeled, intact but disoriented. 
\par "Careful, boys," Agamemnon said. "We don't want to destroy the prize." 
\par Out on the outskirts
 of League space, far from the Synchronized Worlds, the feral humans obviously hadn't expected to encounter enemy predators, and the captain of this vessel had been particularly inattentive. Defeating him would be almost embarrassing. His cymek hunters wo
uld hope for a better challenge, a more entertaining pursuit . . . 
\par The human pilot got his damaged engine back on line and increased speed down into the isolated system, fleeing toward the water world. In his wake, the human launched a flurry of intensely 
bright explosive shells, which caused little physical damage, but sent pulses of confusing static through the machine sensors of the cymek ships. Agamemnon's cymek followers transmitted a series of imaginative curses. Surprisingly, the human victim respon
ded in a gruff, defiant voice with equal venom and vigor. 
\par Agamemnon chuckled to himself and sent a thought-command. This would be more fun. His attack ship burst forward like a wild and energetic horse, part of his imaginary body. "Give chase!" The cymeks,
 enjoying the game, swooped after the hapless human vessel. 
\par The doomed pilot flew standard maneuvers to evade the pursuers. Agamemnon held back, trying to determine if the human was truly so inexperienced or just lulling the cymeks into an unwarranted sense of ease. 
\par They plummeted toward the peaceful blue world-Caladan, according to the onboard database. The world reminded him of the blue irises his human eyes once had. . . . It had been so many centuries, the cymek general could recall few details of his
 original physical appearance. 
\par Agamemnon could have transmitted an ultimatum to the pilot, but humans and cymeks knew the stakes in their long-simmering war. The space yacht opened fire, a few pathetically weak blasts designed for shoving troublesome mete
oroids out of the way rather than defending against overt military action. If this was a noble ship, it should have had much more serious offensive and defensive weapons. The cymeks laughed and closed in, perceiving no threat. 
\par As soon as they approached, though, the desperate human pilot launched another flurry of explosives, apparently the same as the gnat-bite bombs he had launched previously, but Agamemnon detected slight fluctuations. "Caution, I suspect-" 
\par Four proximity mines, each a space charge ten times as powerful as the first artillery, detonated with huge shock waves. Two of the cymek hunters suffered external damage; one was completely destroyed. 
\par Agamemnon lost his patience. "Back off! Engage ship defenses!" 
\par But the yacht pilot fired no more explosives. With one of the surviving cymeks moving only sluggishly, the human could easily have taken him out. Since he did not, the human prey must have no further weapons available. Or was it another trick? 
\par "Don't underestimate the vermin." 
\par Agamemnon 
had hoped to take the feral humans captive, delivering them to Omnius for experiments or analysis, since "wild" specimens were considered different from those raised for generations in captivity. But, angry at the pointless loss of one of his overeager co
mpanions, the general decided it was just too much trouble. 
\par "Vaporize that ship," he transmitted to his five remaining followers. Without waiting for the other cymeks to join him, Agamemnon opened fire.

\par The enemy cymeks pounded them again. In the cockpit, his father shouted curses, and his mother did her best at the weapons station. Their eyes betrayed no fear, only showed strong determination. Harkonnens did not die easily. 
\par Ulf had insisted on installing the best armor and defensive systems available, always suspicious, always ready to fight against any threat. But this lone yacht could not withstand a concerted attack from seven fully armed and aggressive cymek marauders. 

\par Seale
d inside the dim compartment, Piers could do nothing to help. He watched the attacking machines through the porthole, sure his family could not hold out long. Even his father, who refused to bow to defeat, looked as if he had no tricks remaining to him. 

\par Sensing the imminent kill, the cymeks streaked closer. Piers heard repeated thumps reverberating in the vessel. Through the hatch porthole, Piers saw his mother and father gesturing desperately at one another. 
\par Another cymek blast finally breached the prote
ctive plates and damaged the yacht's engines as the vessel careened toward the not-close-enough planet with broad blue seas and white lacings of clouds. Sparks flew on the bridge, and the wounded ship began to tumble. 
\par Ulf Harkonnen shouted something at his wife, then lurched toward the lifepod, trying to keep his balance. Katarina called after him. Piers couldn't figure out what they were arguing about; the ship was doomed. 
\par Cymek weapons fire rocked the vessel with a dull concussion, sending Ulf skidding 
across the deck. Even the augmented hull armor could not withstand much more. The elder Harkonnen struggled to his feet at the lifepod hatch, and Piers suddenly realized that his father wanted to unlock the chamber and get both of them inside with their s
on. 
\par Piers read his mother's lips as she shouted, "No time!" 
\par The lifepod's instrument panel flashed and began running through test cycles. Piers hammered on the hatch, but they had sealed him inside. He couldn't get out to help them. 
\par While Ulf tried frantically to work the hatch controls, Katarina raced for the panel on the wall and slapped the activation switch. While Ulf turned to his wife in astonishment and dismay, Katarina mouthed a desperate farewell to her son. 
\par With a lurch, the lifepod shot into space, away from the doomed space yacht. 
\par Acceleration threw Piers to the deck, but he scrambled to his knees, to the observation port. Behind him, as the lifepod tumbled recklessly through space, the cymek marauders opened fire again and again, six angry t
hinking machines combining their destructive power. 
\par The Harkonnen ship erupted in a sequence of explosions into a dazzling fireball, which dissipated into the cluttered vacuum . . . snuffed out along with the lives of his parents. 
\par Like a cannonball, the lifepod tore into the atmosphere of Caladan, spraying red sparks of reentry as it zoomed toward the blue oceans on the sunlit side of the planet. 
\par Piers struggled with the crude emergency controls in an effort to maneuver, but the small ship didn't respond, as if it were a machine rebelling against its human master. At this rate of speed, he couldn't possibly survive. 
\par The young Harkonnen heir took an agonized breath and tapped pressure pads to alter the thruster pattern. He had little experience in pilotin
g, though his father had insisted that he learn; previously, the skill had not been a priority for Piers, but now he had to figure out the systems without delay. 
\par Looking back, he saw he was being pursued by one of the cymek fighter ships. The spray of reentry sparks increased, like iron filings from a grinding stone. The pursuer's exploding projectiles rocked the atmosphere around him without making direct hits. 

\par Piers sped low over an isolated landmass toward a snowy mountain ridge, with the vicious cymek
 on his tail, still shooting. Sparkling glaciers girdled the jagged peaks. One of the enemy's kinetic projectiles hit a high ridge, shattering ice and rock. Piers closed his eyes and boldly-without a choice-flew through the debris, heard it pummeling the 
lifepod. And he barely survived. 
\par Just after he scraped over the ridge, he heard a tremendous explosion and saw the sky behind him light up in a flash of bright orange. The mechanical pursuer had gone out of control. Destroyed, just like his parents and their spacecraft. . . .

Agamemnon and his cymeks clustered around the space yacht's wreckage in unstable orbit, while mapping the trajectory of the single ejected lifepod. They marked
 where it crossed the atmosphere, how fast it descended, and where it would probably land. The general was in no hurry-after all, where could the lone survivor go on this primitive world? 
\par Without orders, though, the one cymek damaged by proximity mines sh
ot after the lifepod, hungry for revenge. "General Agamemnon, I intend to make this kill on my own." Angrily, the cymek leader paused, then agreed. "Go, you get the first shot. But the rest of us won't wait for long." The cymek leader held the rest of the
m back until he could finish his analysis. 
\par Agamemnon played the distress signal the noble pilot had transmitted shortly before his destruction. The words were encoded, but not with a very sophisticated cipher; the cymek's onboard AI systems translated it e
asily. "This is Lord Ulf Harkonnen, en route from our holdings at Hagal. We are under attack by thinking machines. There is not much chance we will survive." 
\par }{\i\f44\fs28\lang1033\langfe1049\langnp1033\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609 Such amazing powers of prediction}{\f44\fs28\lang1033\langfe1049\langnp1033\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609 . Agamemnon assumed the survivor aboard the lifepod must also be
 a member of the noble family, if not the lord himself. 
\par A thousand years ago, when Agamemnon and his nineteen coconspirators had overthrown the Old Empire, a group of outlying planets had banded together to form the League of Nobles. They had defended the
mselves against the tyrants, maintaining their defense against Omnius and his thinking machines. Computers did not hold grudges or gain vengeance . . . but the cymeks had human minds and human emotions. 
\par If the survivor in the lifepod down on Caladan was a member of the defiant League of Nobles, the cymek general wanted to participate personally in his interrogation, torture, and ultimate execution. 
\par Within minutes, however, he received a last-second transmission just before the cymek pursuer crashed on the surface. 
\par "A foolish mission. Next time I want it done right," Agamemnon said. "Go, find him before he can hide in the wilderness. I give the hunt to the four of you-and a challenge. A reward to the cymek who finds and kills the prey first." 
\par The other cymek ships streaked away from the debris field, heading like hot bullets into the cloudy skies. The human escapee, unarmed in his barely maneuverable lifepod, certainly would not last long.

 Digital and crystal instruments sparked on the panel. Piers tried to interpret them, adjusting the clumsy controls of the careening vessel, then looked up through the porthole to see brown-and-white slopes ahead, bleak frozen hillsides with patches of sn
ow, dark forests. In the last instant, he pulled up, just enough- 
\par The lifepod scraped tall, dark-needled trees and crashed into high tundra covered by only a thin blanket of snow. The impact bounced the pod back into the air, spinning it around for a second plunge into the patchy forest. 
\par In his energy harness, Piers rolled and shouted, trying to survive but expecting the worst. Cushioning bubblefoam squirted all around him just before the first impact, padding his body from the worst injuries. Then the pod
 crashed again, ripping up snow and frozen dirt. The pod finally came to rest, groaning and hissing. 
\par The bubblefoam dissolved, and Piers picked himself up and wiped the fizzing slime from his clothes and hands and hair. He was too shaken to feel pain and couldn't take the time to evaluate his injuries. 
\par He knew his parents were dead, their ship destroyed. He hoped his blurred vision was from blood in his eyes, not tears. He was a Harkonnen, after all. His father would have struck him across the cheek for s
howing cowardly emotion. Ulf had managed to damage the enemy in a fruitless attack, but there were still more cymeks up there. No doubt they would come hunting for him. 
\par Piers fought down panic, turned it into a hard, instant assessment of his situation. If he had any hope of surviving, circumstances forced him to respond with decisiveness, even ruthlessness-the Harkonnen way. And he wouldn't have much time. 
\par The lifepod contained a few survival supplies, but he couldn't stay here. The cymeks would zero in on the vessel and come to finish the job. Once he ran, he would have no chance to return. 
\par Piers grabbed a medical kit and all the ration packs he could carry, stuffing them into a flexible sack. He popped the lifepod's hatch and crawled out, smelling the 
smoke and hearing the crackle of a few gasping fires ignited by the heat of impact. He took a deep breath of cold, biting air, then, closing the hatch behind him, he staggered away from the smoking pod, crunching through slushy snow into the meager shelte
r of dark conifers. He wanted to get as far away as possible before pausing to consider his next step. 
\par In a situation like this, his father would have been concerned about the family holdings, the Hagal mines. With Piers and his parents gone, who would run
 the business and keep the Harkonnen family strong? Right now, though, the young man was more worried for his own survival. He had never fit in with family business philosophies anyway. 
\par Hearing a high-pitched roar, he gazed into the sky and saw four flaming white trails coming toward him like targeted munitions. Cymek landers. Hunters. The machines with human minds would track him down in the desolate wilderness. 
\par As the danger suddenly came closer to home, Piers saw he was leaving deep tracks in the snow.
 Blood dripped from a nasty cut on his left wrist; more scarlet splashed from another injury on his forehead. He might as well be leaving a roadmap for the enemy to follow. 
\par His father had said it in a stern, impatient voice, but the lesson was valuable nevertheless: }{\i\f44\fs28\lang1033\langfe1049\langnp1033\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609 
Be aware of all facets of a situation. Just because something is quiet does not mean it isn't dangerous. Do not trust your safety at any moment.}{\f44\fs28\lang1033\langfe1049\langnp1033\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609  
\par Under the trees, listening to the roar as cymeks converged over his pod's crash-down coordinates, Piers slathered wound sealant on his injuries to stop the bleeding. }{\i\f44\fs28\lang1033\langfe1049\langnp1033\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609

\par He abruptly changed direction, selecting a clear area where trees had sheltered the ground from the snow an
d rocks. He moved over the rocky surface in a deliberately chaotic course, hoping to throw off pursuit. He had no weapons, no knowledge of the terrain . . . and no intention of giving up. 
\par Piers climbed higher up the sloping ground, and the snow grew thick
er where the trees became sparse. When he reached a clearing, he caught his breath and looked back to see that cymek landers had converged at his lifepod. Still not far enough away, but still without any place to run. 
\par Watching in horrified fascination, Pi
ers saw mobile, resilient walker-forms emerge from the landed ships: adaptable mechanical bodies to carry cymek brain canisters across a variety of environments. Like angry crabs, the cymeks crawled over the sealed wreckage, using cutter claws and white-h
ot flamers to tear open the hull. When they found no one inside, they literally ripped the lifepod apart. 
\par The walker-forms stalked around the pod, their optic threads gleaming with a variety of sensors. They scanned his footprints in the snow, moved to whe
re their prey had paused to apply his medical pack. The cymek scanners could easily pick up his footprints in the dirt, thermal traces from his body heat, any number of clues. Unerringly, they set out across the bare ground toward where he had chosen to f
lee. 
\par Chiding himself for the momentary panic that had made him leave such an obvious trail, Piers broke into a full run uphill, always looking for a place to hide, a weapon to use. He tried to ignore his hammering heart and his difficulty breathing in this
 cold, rugged environment of Caladan. He crashed into another thicket of the dark pines, always climbing. The slope became steeper, but because of the dense conifers, he couldn't see exactly where he was going or how close he might be to the top of a ridg
e. 
\par He saw sticks, rocks, but nothing that would be an effective weapon against the mechanical monsters, no way to defend himself against the horrific machines. But Piers was, after all, a Harkonnen, and he would not give up. He would hurt them if he could.
 At the very least, he would offer them a fine chase. 
\par Far to his rear, Piers heard crashing sounds, cracking trees, and imagined the cymeks clearing a path for their armored bodies. Judging from the smoke, they must be setting the forest on fire as well. 
Good-that way they would ruin the subtleties of his trail. 
\par He kept running as the ground became rockier, with patches of ice spreading out on steep slopes. Precariously balanced snow clung to the mountain, ready to break loose at any moment. The trees at 
this elevation were bent and twisted, and he smelled a foul sulfurous taint in the air. At his feet he saw tiny bubbling puddles, suffused with yellow. 
\par He furrowed his brows, pondering what this could mean. A thermal area. He had read about such places in
 his studies, esoteric geological anomalies that his father had forced him to learn before sending him to the mining operations on Hagal. This would be a region of volcanic activity with hot springs, geysers, fumaroles . . . a dangerous place, but one tha
t offered opportunities against large opponents. 
\par Piers ran toward the strong smell and the thickening mist, hoping this would give him an advantage. Cymeks did not use eyes like humans did, and their sensors were delicate, sensitive to different parts of t
he spectrum. In some cases, it gave the machine pursuers an incredible advantage. Here, though, with the wild plumes of heat and the rocky, sterile ground, the cymeks could not use their scanners to pick up residual traces from his footprints. 
\par He raced th
rough the misty, humid no-man's-land of rocks, snow patches, crusty bare earth, trying to throw off pursuit and seeking a place to hide, or defend. After hours of headlong flight, he collapsed on a warm boulder encrusted with orange lichen next to a hissi
ng steam vent. More than anything else, he wanted to curl up under a rocky overhang next to one of the hot springs, remaining hidden long enough to sleep for a few hours. 
\par But cymeks did not require sleep. All of their life-support needs were taken care of with restorative electrafluid that kept them alive in their preservation canisters. They would keep pursuing him without pause. 
\par Piers cracked open the food rations and gobbled two high-energy wafers, but he forced himself to set off again before he felt any resurgence of stamina. He had to press his advantage, not lose any ground. 
\par Using his hands and feet now, Piers climbed steeper rocks. His fingers became powdery with yellow sulfur. He chose the steepest terrain, hoping it would prove difficult for the cymek walker bodies, but it also slowed him down. 
\par The wind began to pick up, and Piers felt it against his face, alternating blasts of warm and cold. The mists cleared in patches, and suddenly the landscape was revealed around him. He looked back toward t
he last remnants of conifer forests, jutting rocks, and the bubbling mineral pools far beneath him. 
\par Then he saw one of the cymek walker-forms, alone, stalking him. The other three must have separated, circling in their hunt, as if it were some sort of game. The mechanical body glistened silver in the sudden wash of afternoon light. Searching. 
\par Piers knew he was exposed and unprotected on the rocky slope; he slammed his body tight against the rocks, hoping to remain unseen. But within seconds, the cymek had
 targeted its prey. The mechanical walker unleashed a fiery projectile, a splattering globule of flaming gel that missed Piers and struck the rock, clinging fire. 
\par He scrambled up the rock, finding a new surge of energy. Scuttling rapidly, the cymek negotiated the rough slope, no longer wasting time on the tedious job of tracking the human. 
\par Piers was trapped, with precipitous drop-offs and hot sulfurous pools on the left and right and a steep, smooth snowfield crusted with yellow contaminants above him. On
ce he got to the top of the ridge, perhaps he could throw rocks, somehow dislodge the cymek below him. He saw no other option. 
\par Clawing with his hands and struggling for footholds, Piers worked his way up the slick glacier field. His shoes punched through 
the crust, sinking into cold snow up to his knees. His fingers soon grew numb and red. The frigid air seared his lungs, but he scrambled faster, farther. His domineering father would have sneered at him for worrying about mere physical discomfort in a tim
e of such urgency. The glacier seemed to go on forever, though he could see the top, a sheer razor edge on the crest. 
\par The machine hunters must have split up, and perhaps he had eluded the other three among the thermal plumes and crumbling rocks. Unable to 
find his tracks, they would be combing the ground . . . relentless, as machines always were. Only one of the cymeks had found him, apparently by accident. 
\par Even so, a single monstrous enemy was more than enough to kill him, and this one would be in radio contact with the others. Already they must be coming this way. But this one seemed eager to kill Piers all by itself. 
\par Below, the cymek reached the base of the ice field, scanned for a moment, and then scuttled up. Its long legs stabbed into the snow, climbing faster than any human could hope to run. 
\par The cymek paused, rocked back, then launched another gelfire projectile. Piers burrowed into the snow, and the hot explosive ripped a crater barely an arm's length away from him. The violent impact caused the s
teep and precarious snowfield to tremble and shift. Around him, the crust began to break apart like a peeling scab. Taking a chance, he kicked hard at one of the hard slabs of packed snow, hoping to send it tumbling down to strike his enemy, but the froze
n surface jammed tight again, squeaking and groaning, then falling silent. With a deep breath, he climbed upward again. 
\par As the cymek closed the gap, Piers noticed a rocky outcropping that protruded from the snow. He would scramble up there and make his stand. Maybe he could throw boulders at the machine, though he had no illusions about how effective that would be. 
\par }{\i\f44\fs28\lang1033\langfe1049\langnp1033\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609 Only a fool leaves himself without options}{\f44\fs28\lang1033\langfe1049\langnp1033\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609 , Ulf Harkonnen would have said. 
\par Piers grumbled at the memory. "At least I survived longer than you did, Father." 
\par Then, to his astonishment, at the crest of the glacier he saw a group of figures that looked . . . }{\i\f44\fs28\lang1033\langfe1049\langnp1033\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609 human}{
\f44\fs28\lang1033\langfe1049\langnp1033\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609 ! He counted dozens of people who stood at the top of the snowfield. They shouted incomprehensible curses at the cymek. 
\par The silhouetted strangers lifted large cylinders-weapons of some sort?-and began to beat on them. Loud booming sounds echoed across the mountains like thunderclaps, explosions. }{\i\f44\fs28\lang1033\langfe1049\langnp1033\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609 
Drums}{\f44\fs28\lang1033\langfe1049\langnp1033\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609 . 
\par The strangers pounded on their noisemakers. They had no apparent rhythm at first, but then the pulses combined into a resonance, an echoing boom that set the whole snowfield trembling. 
\par Cracks widened atop the ice, and the glacier began to shift. The massive cymek walker struggled for purchase as the frozen ground began to slide. 
\par Seeing what was about to happen, Piers dove for the rock outcropping, sheltering himself in a pocket walled off by thick stone on each side. He held on just as the snow broke free with a hissing, tumbling roar. 
\par The avalanche struck the cymek like a white tidal wave
, bowling over the walker-form, knocking and battering it against other rocks. As the enemy machine crashed down the slope, Piers closed his eyes and waited for the rumbling roar to reach its crescendo and then taper off. 
\par When he finally emerged, amazed t
o be alive, the air itself sparkled with ice crystals thrown into the sky. While the snowpack undoubtedly remained unstable, the strange people charged pell-mell down the broken snow and ice, yelling excitedly like hunters who had just bagged an impressiv
e quarry. 
\par Still unable to believe what he was seeing, Piers stood atop the boulders. And then he spotted the twitching and battered cymek far down the slope, toppled onto its back. The avalanche had struck it with a destructive force equivalent to a heavy 
weapon. The cymek had been bashed, dented, and twisted, but still its mechanical limbs attempted to haul the walker-form upright. 
\par Although the primitive humans wore drab survival garb made of scavenged materials, they carried sophisticated tools, more tha
n just spears or clubs. Four young natives hurried to the edge of the broken ice field and the trees-scouts?-and they kept watch, wary of other cymeks. 
\par The remaining humans fell like hyenas upon the crippled cymek, wielding cutters and grappling wrenches.
 Was the mechanical hunter calling for help from its three comrades? The natives quickly bashed the transmitter antennas on the walker body then, with startling efficiency they dismantled the walker's struggling legs. The cymek weapon arm flickered in an 
attempt to launch another flaming projectile, but the Caladan primitives quickly disconnected the components. 
\par From the cymek's speaker patch came a volley of angry threats and curses, but the humans paid no attention, showing no fear. They worked diligentl
y to disconnect the hydraulics, fiber cables, neurelectronics, setting each piece aside like valuable scrap material. They left the cymek's brain canister exposed, the traitorous human mind disembodied once again, though this time not by its own volition.
 
\par Numb, Piers looked at the oddly harmless-looking canister that held the cymek's mind. The natives did not destroy it immediately, but seemed to have other plans. They held it up like a trophy. 
\par Full of questions, Piers made his way down the shifting surface of broken snow. The natives looked up at him as he approached, showing curiosity without threat. They spoke a gibberish language that he could not comprehend. 
\par "Who are you?" Piers asked in standard Galach, hoping that someone here would understand him. 
\par One of the men, a gaunt old fellow with a short reddish beard and lighter skin than his companions, gestured toward Piers in happy victory. He stood in front of Piers, pounded himself on the chest. "Tiddoc." 
\par "Piers Harkonnen." He responded, then decided to simplify, "Piers." 
\par "Good, Piers. Thank you," he said in recognizable Galach, but with a thick accent. Seeing the young man's surprise, Tiddoc spoke slowly, as if fishing the right words out of his memory. "Our tongue has Galach roots from the Zensunni
 Wanderers, who fled the League long ago. For years I worked in cities of the noblemen, performing menial tasks. I picked up words here and there." 
\par Paralyzed and immobile, the captured enemy cymek continued to snarl insults through an integrated speakerpa
tch as the Caladan natives used two of the amputated walker legs as support rods, lashing the brain canister so that it dangled between the poles like some captured wild beast. Two of the strongest-looking natives put the metal rods over their shoulders a
nd began to march back up the slope. The other natives gathered up the components they could carry and climbed the rough mountainside. 
\par "Come with us," Tiddoc said. 
\par Piers had no option but to follow them.

 of his knees throbbed with each step, and his back stiffened until it burned. He had not yet had time to accept the deaths of his parents. He missed his mother, for her kind attentions, her intelligence. Katarina had saved his life, launching the lifepod
 before the cymeks could destroy the space yacht. 
\par In a way, Piers even missed his father. Despite Ulf's gruffness, he had only wanted the best for his sons, harshly focused on his responsibilities for Harkonnen holdings. Advancing the family fortunes was a
lways paramount. Now it seemed that his little brother, Xavier, was all that remained of the Harkonnen bloodline. Piers had little hope that he would ever get away from Caladan . . . but at least he had survived this long. 
\par He limped up the steep slope, tr
ying to keep pace with the agile natives. Inside its preservation canister, the evil cymek brain sloshed as the primitives carried it. Staticky shouts came from the canister's speakerpatch, first in standard Galach, then in other languages. Tiddoc and the
 natives seemed to find it amusing 
\par The natives paid little attention to the disembodied brain, except to glare at it and bare their teeth. The red-bearded old man was the most demonstrative. In addition to menacing facial expressions, he made threatening g
estures with a cutting tool, swinging it close to the canister's sensors, which only served to agitate the captive brain more. Obviously they had encountered cymeks before and knew how to fight them. 
\par But Piers was concerned about the other three mechanica
l hunters. They would not give up the pursuit-and once they found the avalanche site and the dismantled walker-form, the cymeks could track the natives here. Unless the captured one had not been able to signal for help before the avalanche had swept it aw
ay. Cymeks did not like to admit weakness. 
\par Piers looked around for any fortifications the people had made. Ahead, overhanging ice formed, a giant roof that sheltered a settlement. The primitives had made their camp in a large area melted out by thermal ven
ts in the ground. Women and children bustled among rock huts, performing chores, pausing to look at the approaching party. The people wore thick clothing, boots, and hats lined with fur from unknown local animals. Piers heard the yelping of animals, saw f
urry white creatures near the dwellings. 
\par Beyond the shelter of the overhang, steam roiled up through thick layers of ice and snow, accompanied by heat bubbles from mudpots and geysers. As Piers followed the tribe down narrow rock steps toward the settlemen
t, he marveled at the stunning contrast of fire and ice, even as he cast constant worried glances over his shoulder to make sure he saw no sign of the other cymek hunters. Occasional droplets rained down from the frozen ceiling of the dome, slowly melting
, but when Piers looked up at the blue ice overhead, he decided the glacier-and the settlement-had been here for a long time. . . . 
\par When abrupt darkness fell like a curtain drawn in front of the sun, the native Caladan women used jagged pieces of wood to b
uild a large fire on a rocky area at the center of the settlement. Scouts went out on patrol to keep watch for enemy machines while the rest of the tribe settled down to celebrate. The men brought hunks of fresh meat from other hunts and speared them on l
ong metal spits over the fire. 
\par They placed the captive cymek's brain canister off to one side, in the ice, and ignored it. 
\par Speaking to one another in their guttural tongue, the natives sat on furs around the fire and passed the food around, sharing with t
heir visitor. Piers found the meat too gamey for his liking, but he finished a large hunk, not wanting to insult his hosts. He was famished, and supplemented his meal with part of a ration bar he had salvaged from the lifepod; he offered the rest of the p
ackaged food to his rescuers, and they eagerly accepted. 
\par Still, the urgency gnawed at him. Even among so many other people, he did not feel safe, and he tried to convince the old leader that the danger had not gone away. "There are more cymeks, Tiddoc. I think they're hunting me." 
\par "We already killed one," he said. 
\par "But what about the others? They are still out there-" 
\par "We will kill them, too. If they bother with you. Cymeks have little patience. Lose interest quickly. Are you so important to them? My people know that we are not." He patted Piers's wrist. "We have scouts. We have defenses." 
\par Following the meal, Tiddoc and his people sat around the story fire, telling ancient parables and adventures in their native tongue. During the sharing, the tribesmen 
passed around gourds of a potent beverage. Wrapped in a fur to ward off the chill air, Piers drank, and felt warm in his belly. At intervals, the old man translated for Piers, relating tales of the downtrodden Zensunni who had fled the machine takeovers, 
as well as slavery in the League of Nobles. 
\par A little tipsy, Piers defended the League and their continuing fight against the thinking machines, though he sympathized with the unpleasant plight of the Buddislamic slaves on Poritrin, Zanbar, and other League
 worlds. While Tiddoc struggled to translate, Piers told of epic battles against the evil Omnius and his aggressive robots and cymeks. 
\par And, with a thick voice, he told how his own ship had been destroyed, his parents killed. . . . 
\par Tiddoc gestured to the 
cymek brain canister. "Come. The feasting is done. Now we finish our machine war. The people have been looking forward to this." He shouted something in his own language, and two men lifted the canister by its improvised poles. The cymek grumbled from its
 speakerpatch, but it had run out of effective curses. 
\par Several women lit torches from the central fire and led the way up a path from the dripping glacier overhang. Full of good cheer, the natives marched away, carrying the impotent enemy brain. The cymek 
hurled threats in every language it could think of, but the primitives only laughed at it. 
\par "What are you doing?" the cymek demanded. Controlling his last functional thoughtrodes, the disembodied brain twisted in its container. "Stop! We will crush you all!" 
\par Piers followed them over a ridge and down a slope to where the air reeked of sulfur and the porous rock grew warm underfoot. Carrying the helpless cymek, the group paused at a steaming hole in the rock and stood chattering and laughing. They held the b
rain canister over the ominous opening. 
\par Piers bent closer to the hole, curious, but Tiddoc yanked him away. The red-bearded elder wore an eerie smile in the torchlight. 
\par A rumble sounded deep below, and with a preliminary spurt of hot spray, a geyser erup
ted, a scalding jet that parboiled the cymek's brain. The enemy's curses turned to shrieks, followed by babbling sounds and disjointed pain that trickled out of the damaged speakerpatch. 
\par When the geyser subsided, the delirious cymek cried and gibbered. Moments later the geyser erupted again, and the speakerpatch unleashed hideous howls that sent shudders down Piers's spine. 
\par Even though this monster had tried to kill him, had taken part in the murder of his parents, Piers could not tolerate hearing its misery anymore. When the boiling jet subsided again, he took a rock and smashed the speaker, disconnecting it. 
\par But the natives continued to hold the agonized brain over the geyser hole, and when the scalding spray gushed out a third time, the cymek screamed in silence, until it was boiled alive in its electrafluid. 
\par The natives then cracked the canister open on a rock and devoured the hot, cooked contents.

The rock hut was warm and marginally comfortable, but Piers slept poorly, unable to put the horri
fic images out of his mind. When he finally dreamed, he saw himself strapped to poles while the natives held him over the geyser hole. He heard boiling water rushing toward him, and he awoke with a scream caught in his throat. 
\par Outside, he heard only the howl of an animal, then silence. 
\par Then mechanical sounds. 
\par He stumbled to the entrance of the hut and peered outside into the cold, sulfur-smelling air. Now the furry guard animals howled. The primitives shouted and stirred in their encampment. The scouts had been watching. 
\par In a slit of grayish, misty sky between the ground and the icy overhang Piers saw four aircraft approaching with insect-machine noises, their engines glowing in the predawn sky. }{

\par Tiddoc and the natives fled their stone huts, grab
bing torches, weapons. Piers ran out, anxious to help. He had lost the other two cymek hunters in his flight the previous day, but the sophisticated thinking machines had combed the landscape with their scanners until they finally picked up his trail . . 
. which had led the monsters here. 
\par The cymek ships landed in the nearby rock field and opened hatches, each one disgorging an armed walker body. The crablike warrior machines marched downslope with alarming speed. Ahead, the primitives scattered, hooting, 
waving torches, taunting the enemy. 
\par One of the cymeks launched a rocket of gelfire, which exploded and collapsed part of the arched, glacier ceiling. Shards of ice tumbled down, smashing the evacuated stone huts. 
\par Tiddoc and the villagers scampered out of
 the way as if it were a game, gesturing for Piers to follow as they hurried along the path they had taken the night before, onto the geyser field. In daylight Piers saw that it was a broad, gently sloped area of boiling mudpots and hot springs. Fumaroles
 
and geysers belched repeatedly, filling the air with foul steam and heat plumes. Shouting, cursing, the people split up, following instinctive routes across the crusty ground. The natives' supposed panic was a strangely organized action, like a cat and mo
use game. Were they luring the enemy? They seemed to have a plan, a hunt of their own. 
\par Piers ran along with them, ducking as the four cymek walkers shot projectiles into the hissing thermal area. Their mechanical bodies plodded forward like heavy spiders o
n the uncertain ground. For sophisticated machines, their aim was terrible. The cymeks' optic threads and thermal sensors must be nearly blinded in the chaos of heat signatures. 
\par Tiddoc hurled a spear, which clanked on the head turret of the largest cymek walker. It was an ineffective weapon, designed to distract and provoke the cymek, rather than damage the walker body. The leader ran ahead, hooting, luring the cymek onward. 

\par Agitated, the largest machine-creature bellowed through a speakerpatch, "You cannot escape Agamemnon!" The other three cymeks scrambled along behind it. 
\par Piers shuddered. All free humans knew the famous general of Omnius's army, one of the brutal original tyrants. 
\par With a lucky shot, one of the enemy machines blasted a young man who da
nced too close to the weapon arm, and his twitching, burning body writhed on the ground. The Caladan natives, looking angry and vengeful, tightened their ranks and worked harder against the cymeks. They tossed homemade explosives that exploded with smoke 
and fire and a loud concussion, leaving scorch marks on the cymek bodies. The machines with human minds did not slow in their progress. 
\par Light-footed, the primitives raced across the volcanically active area. The cymeks, oblivious to the trap, charged after
 their prey, smashing salty encrustations, pursuing the natives into the reeking mists. They shot more blobs of gelfire, fired explosive projectiles. Another daring man died, his chest blasted into a smoking crater. 
\par Tiddoc and the natives kept hooting and shouting, defiant. Two of the smaller cymeks surged forward into a crater-pocked geyser field. The waving, taunting primitives stopped and turned, expectant. 
\par The thin shell of hardened ground cracked, split. The two mechanical walker forms tried to skitt
er backward, but the surface gave way beneath them, breaking apart. Both cymeks plunged through the dangerous ground and tumbled screaming into roiling sulfur cauldrons. 
\par Piers joined Tiddoc and the other humans in their loud cheer, which was squelched with a third native, a long-haired young woman, was cut down by hot projectiles. 
\par Unexpectedly, a furious geyser blast rocketed out of the ground next to a third cymek attacker, scalding the brain canister. Its thoughtrodes damaged, the mechanical behemoth ve
ered away and stumbled around in confusion. The cymek fell to its articulated knees, the electrafluid in its stained brain canister glowing blue as it focused its mental energy. 
\par Tiddoc tossed a small, homemade explosive onto the ground, like a crude grena
de. The detonation caused no further damage to the armored walker, but the ground crust fractured. While the wounded mechanical enemy reeled, disoriented, the surface gave way. The third cymek joined the others in the molten mud. 
\par Agamemnon kept advancing 
toward the retreating humans, as if scorning his incompetent underlings. The lead cymek stalked unwavering toward old Tiddoc. The red-bearded man and his companions threw their spears and more crude explosives, but the mechanical general did not flinch. B
ehind them and on the sides lay superheated soil, while the immense cymek blocked their only avenue of escape. 
\par On impulse, Piers ran in front of the lead cymek, shouting to distract it. He snatched up a discarded spear and thumped it against one of the tall walker legs. "Agamemnon! You murdered my parents!" 
\par To his surprise, the cymek general swiveled its head turret, and thermal sensors locked onto the upstart human's form. "A feisty one!" the monster said with considerable amusement. "You are the vermin we have been chasing." 
\par "I am a Harkonnen nobleman!" Piers shouted. He swung the spear like a cudgel at the brain canister. He struck the thick armor plaz with a blow hard enough to rattle his bones-but he left only a tiny nick on the protective canister. 
\par The cymek bellowed a laugh. One of Agamemnon's clawed legs grabbed Piers, yanked away the spear. The young man felt the sharp claw tighten around his torso. He was dimly aware of Tiddoc howling- 
\par Then suddenly the crust gave way beneath the heavy cymek wal
ker. Frothing mud gushed upward, and Agamemnon tumbled into a boiling geyser pit, still clutching his human victim. The claw loosened, just barely, and Piers scrambled on top of the body, trying to shield himself from the heat, to grab the rough rock of t
he pit's edge. Superheated steam blasted upward, eradicating all signs of Piers and the last machine invader.

Alive and angry, Agamemnon reinstalled himself in an intact spaceship lander and departed from the watery world. With his heavily protected 
walker body, he had clamped onto the edges of the fuming pit, endured the steam blasts without falling into the molten mud. 
\par The verminous people rallied, hurled more explosives at him, and Agamemnon despised himself for being forced to retreat. With his h
ydraulics already damaged-and his foolish neo-cymeks all wiped out-his walker-form limped and scuttled back to the landed spacecraft, leaving the tribe behind. Systems onboard his ship reconfigured his brain canister to the controls; he discarded the ruin
ed walker body, leaving it as scrap on the cursed surface of Caladan. 
\par The only survivor of his cymek squad, Agamemnon left the unremarkable world behind. He would return to Earth, and the computer evermind Omnius, and make his report. At this point, he was
 at liberty to create whatever explanation he chose. Omnius would never suspect him of lying: Such things simply did not occur to the all-pervasive computer. But the cymek general had a human brain. . . . 
\par As Agamemnon flew out into open space, he would have enough time to think of appropriate explanations and shift the blame. He would include a version of the events in his ever-growing memoirs recorded in the machine database. 
\par Fortunately, the all-powerful and all-seeing evermind simply wanted information and an accurate recounting of all events. }{\f44\fs28\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609 Making excuses was a purely human weakness.

On the League capital world of Salusa Secundus, a young boy looked up at dark-skinned Emil Tantor, a wealthy and influential nobleman. They stood on the front law
n of the sprawling Tantor estate, with the tallest buildings of the city visible in the distance. It was early evening, with lights twinkling on in the palatial homes that dotted the hills. 
\par Ulf Harkonnen's distress signal had finally been intercepted, and Emil Tantor had brought the boy the terrible news about his parents and brother. More casualties in the long-standing war against the thinking machines. 
\par Young Xavier Harkonnen bowed his head, but refused to cry. The kindly nobleman touched his shoulder a
nd spoke deep-throated, gentle words. "Will you have me, and Lucille, as your foster parents? I think it is what your father wanted when he left you in our care." 
\par Xavier looked into his brown eyes, nodded. 
\par "You'll grow into a fine young man," Tantor said, "one to make your brother and parents proud. We will do our best to raise you right, to teach you honor and responsibility. You will make the Harkonnen name shine in the annals of history." 
\par Xavier gazed beyond his foster father up to the faint stars glimmering through the dusk. He could identify some of those stars, and knew which systems were controlled by Omnius and which were League Worlds. 
\par "I will also learn how to fight the thinking machines," he said. Emil Tantor squeezed his shoulder. "I will defeat them one day."

On a dark night in the bright snowfield and dark pines, the Caladan primitives sat on furs around a roaring fire. Keeping their oral tradition alive, they repeated the ancient legends and stories of rece
nt battles. The elder Tiddoc sat beside the foreigner accepted among them, a hero with bright eyes and waxy, horribly scarred skin. A man who had fought single-handedly against a cymek monster and fallen into a scalding hot opening . . . but had crawled o

t alive, clinging to the battered cymek walker-form. Piers gestured with one hand; the other-burned and twisted into uselessness-hung limp against his chest. He spoke passionately in the ancient Buddislamic tongue, halting as he struggled for words and th

\par Caladan was his home now, and he would live the rest of his life with these people, in obscurity. No escape seemed possible from such a remote place, except through the stories he told. Piers kept his audience enthrall

\par As his father had realized, Piers Harkonnen had always wanted to be a storyteller.

While considering the implications of the statement, Erasmus shifted the expression on his flowmetal face. For centuries his quest had been to decipher these biological creatures: They had so many flaws,\hich\af44\dbch\af13\loch\f44 
 but somehow, in a spark of genius, they had created thinking machines. The puzzle intrigued him. 
\par \hich\af44\dbch\af13\loch\f44 He had mounted various slogans around his laboratory to initiate trains of thought at unexpected times. Philosophy was far more than a game to him; it was a \hich\af44\dbch\af13\loch\f44

At first, he had assumed the discrepancies from the Serena he had known were inconsequential, the difference between a juvenile and the woman she would ultimately become. But as the clone approached the equivalent age at which he had kn

\par \hich\af44\dbch\af13\loch\f44 Sensing that he could no longer justify further delays, the Tlulaxa researcher rushed his final preparations. Dressed again in his regal robe, Erasmus arrived to o\hich\af44\dbch\af13\loch\f44

\par \hich\af44\dbch\af13\loch\f44 Still dripping from the tank, Serena didn\hich\f44 \rquote \loch\f44 t seem to care about her nudity, though the original would no doubt have been offended; just one\hich\af44\dbch\af13\loch\f44

\par though occasionally a grin stole across his lips as the craft bucked and 
\par jostled in rough air. As they completed their fifth day on patrol, he 
\par continued to mark discrepancies on topographical maps, muttering in 
\par disgust each time he found another mistake. These were the worst 
\par charts he had ever used. 
\par 
\par In the back passenger compartment sat Josten, recently transferred from 
\par Giedi Prime. Accustomed to industrial facilities, gray skies, and dirty 
\par buildings, Josten gazed out over the sandy wastelands, studying 
\par hypnotic dune patterns. He spotted the knot of dust off to the south, 
\par deep in the open Funeral Plain. "What's that? Spice-harvesting 
\par operation?" 
\par 
\par "Not a chance," the sidegunner Kiel said. "Harvesters shoot a plume 
\par like a cone into the air, straight and thin." 
\par 
\par "Too low for a dust devil. Too small." With a shrug, Garan jerked the 
\par 'thopter controls and soared toward the low, reddish-brown cloud. 
\par "Let's take a look." After so many tedious days, they would have gone 
\par out of their way to investigate a large rock sticking out of the sand... 
\par 
\par When they reached the site, they found no tracks, no machinery, no 
\par sign of human presence-and yet acres of desert looked devastated. A 
\par mottled rust color stained the sands a darker ochre, as if blood from a 
\par wound had dried in the hot sun. 
\par 
\par "Looks like somebody dropped a bomb here," Kiel said. 
\par 
\par "Could be the aftermath of a spice blow," Garan suggested. "I'll set 
\par down for a closer look." 
\par 
\par As the 'thopter settled onto the churned sands, Kiel popped open the 
\par hatch. The temperature-controlled atmosphere hissed out, replaced by a 
\par wave of heat. He coughed dust. 
\par 
\par Garan leaned over from the cockpit and sniffed hard. "Smell it." The 
\par odor of burnt cinnamon struck his nostrils. "Spice blow for sure." 
\par 
\par Josten squeezed past Kiel and dropped onto the soft ground. Amazed, 
\par he bent down, picked up a handful of ochre sand and touched it to his 
\par lips. "Can we scoop up some fresh spice and take it back? Must be 
\par worth a fortune." 
\par 
\par Kiel had been thinking the same thing, but now he turned to the 
\par newcomer with scorn. "We don't have the processing equipment. You 
\par need to separate it from the sand, and you can't do that with your 
\par fingers." 
\par 
\par Garan spoke in a quieter, but firmer voice. "If you went back to 
\par Carthag and tried to sell raw product to a street vendor you'd be hauled 
\par in front of Governor Rabban-or worse yet, have to explain to Count 
\par Fenring how some of the Emperor's spice ended up in a patrolman's 
\par pockets." 
\par 
\par As the troopers tromped out to the ragged pit at the center of the 
\par dissipating dust cloud, Josten glanced around. "Is it safe for us to be 
\par here? Don't the big worms go to spice?" 
\par 
\par "Afraid, kid?" Kiel asked. 
\par 
\par "Let's throw him to a worm if we see one," Garan suggested. "It'll give 
\par us time to get away." 
\par 
\par Kiel saw movement in the sandy excavation, shapes squirming, buried 
\par things that tunneled and burrowed, like maggots in rotten meat. Josten 
\par opened his mouth to say something, then clamped it shut again. 
\par 
\par A whiplike creature emerged from the sand, two meters long with 
\par fleshy segmented skin. It was the size of a large snake, its mouth an 
\par open circle glittering with needle-sharp teeth that lined its throat. 
\par 
\par "A sandworm!" Josten said. 
\par 
\par "Only a runt," Kiel scoffed. 
\par 
\par "Newborn-do you think?" Garan asked. 
\par 
\par The worm waved its eyeless head from side to side. Other slithering 
\par creatures, a nest of them, squirmed about as if they'd been spawned in 
\par the explosion. 
\par 
\par "Where in the hells did they come from?" Kiel asked. 
\par 
\par "Wasn't in my briefing," Garan said. 
\par 
\par "Can we ... catch one?" Josten asked. 
\par 
\par Kiel stopped himself from making a rude rejoinder, realizing that the 
\par young recruit did have a good idea. "Come on!" He charged forward 
\par into the churned sand. 
\par 
\par The worm sensed the movement and reared back, uncertain whether to 
\par attack or flee. Then it arced like a sea serpent and plunged into the 
\par sand, wriggling and burrowing. 
\par 
\par Josten sprinted ahead and dove face-first to grasp the segmented body 
\par three quarters of the way to its end. "It's so strong!" Following him, the 
\par sidegunner jumped down and grabbed the thrashing tail. 
\par 
\par The worm tried to tug away, but Garan reached the front, where he dug 
\par into the sand and grabbed behind its head with a stranglehold. All three 
\par troopers wrestled and pulled. "Get it!" The small worm thrashed like an 
\par eel on an electric plate. 
\par 
\par Other sandworms on the far side of the pit rose like a strange forest of 
\par periscopes sprouting from the sea of dunes, round mouths like black os 
\par turned toward the men. For an icy moment, Kiel feared they might 
\par attack like a swarm of marrow leeches, but the immature worms darted 
\par away and disappeared underground. 
\par 
\par Garan and Kiel hauled their captive out of the sand and dragged it 
\par toward the ornithopter. As a Harkonnen patrol, they had all the 
\par equipment necessary to arrest criminals, including old-fashioned 
\par devices for trussing a captive like a herd animal. "Josten, go get the 
\par binding cords in our apprehension kit," the pilot said. 
\par 
\par The new recruit came running back with the cords, fashioning a loop 
\par which he slipped over the worm's head and cinched tight. Garan 
\par released his hold on the rubbery skin and grabbed the rope, tugging 
\par while Josten slipped a second cord lower on the body. 
\par 
\par "What are we going to do with it?" Josten asked. 
\par 
\par Once, early in his assignment on Arrakis, Kiel had joined Rabban on an 
\par abortive worm hunt. They had taken a Fremen guide, well-armed 
\par troops, even a Planetologist. Using the Fremen guide as bait, they had 
\par lured one of the enormous sandworms and killed it with explosives. But 
\par before Rabban could take his trophy, the beast had dissolved, sloughing 
\par into amoeba creatures that fell to the sand, leaving nothing but a 
\par cartilaginous skeleton and loose crystal teeth. Rabban had been furious. 
\par 
\par Kiel's stomach knotted. The Baron's nephew might consider it an insult 
\par that three simple patrolmen could capture a worm, when he'd been 
\par unable to do so himself. "We'd better drown it." 
\par 
\par "Drown it?" Josten said. "What for? And why would I want to waste 
\par my water ration to do that?" 
\par 
\par Garan stopped as if struck by a thunderbolt. "I've heard the Fremen do 
\par it. If you drown a baby worm, they say it spits out some kind of drug or 
\par poison. It's very rare." 
\par 
\par Kiel nodded. "Oh, yeah. The desert people use it in their religious 
\par rituals. It makes everybody go crazy, wild orgies and everything." 
\par 
\par "But ... we've only got two literjons of water in the compartment," 
\par Josten said, still nervous. 
\par 
\par "Then we only use one. I know where we can refill it, anyway." The 
\par pilot and his sidegunner exchanged glances. They had patrolled 
\par together long enough that they'd both thought of the same thing. 
\par 
\par As if understanding its fate, the worm bucked and thrashed even more, 
\par but it was already growing weaker. 
\par 
\par "Once we get the drug," Kiel said, "let's have some fun." 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par \'b7 \'b7 \'b7 \'b7 \'b7  
\par 
\par 
\par At night, with the patrol 'thopter running in stealth mode, they flew 
\par over the razor-edged mountains, approaching from behind a ridge and 
\par landing on a rough mesa above the squalid village of Bilar Camp. The 
\par villagers lived in hollowed-out caves and aboveground structures that 
\par extended out to the flats. Windmills generated power; supply bins 
\par glittered with tiny lights that attracted a few moths and the bats that fed 
\par on them.
\par  
\par Unlike the nomadic Fremen, these villagers were slightly more 
\par civilized but also more downtrodden: men who worked as desert guides 
\par and joined spice-harvesting crews. They had forgotten how to survive 
\par on their world without becoming parasites upon the planetary 
\par governors. 
\par 
\par On an earlier patrol, Kiel and Garan had discovered a camouflaged 
\par cistern on the mesa, a treasure trove of water. Kiel didn't know where 
\par the villagers had gotten so much moisture; most likely, they had 
\par committed fraud, inflating their census numbers so that Harkonnen 
\par generosity provided more than they deserved. 
\par 
\par The people of Bilar Camp covered the cistern with rock so that it 
\par looked like a natural protrusion, but the villagers placed no guards 
\par around their illegal stockpile. For some reason desert culture forbade 
\par thievery even more than murder; they trusted the safety of their 
\par possessions from bandits or thieves of the night. 
\par 
\par Of course, the Harkonnen troopers had no intention of stealing the 
\par water-that is, no more than enough to refill their own supply 
\par containers. 
\par 
\par Dutifully, Josten trotted along with their sloshing container, which held 
\par the thick, noxious substance exuded by the drowned worm after it had 
\par stopped thrashing and bucking inside the container. Awed and nervous 
\par about what they'd done, they dumped the flaccid carcass near the 
\par perimeter of the spice blow and then taken off with the drug. 
\par 
\par Garan operated the Bilar cistern's cleverly concealed spigot and refilled 
\par one of their empty containers. No sense in letting all the water go to 
\par waste just for a practical joke on the villagers. 
\par 
\par "Do you know what this drug will do to them?" Josten asked. 
\par 
\par Garan shook his head. "I've heard plenty of crazy stories." 
\par 
\par "Maybe we should make the kid try it first," the sidegunner said. 
\par 
\par Josten backed away, raising his hands. 
\par 
\par Kiel took the container of worm bile and upended it into the cistern. 
\par The villagers would certainly have a surprise next time they all drank 
\par from their illegal water hoard. "Serves them right." 
\par 
\par Garan looked at the contaminated cistern again. "I bet they tear off their 
\par clothes and dance naked in the streets, squawking like dinfowl." 
\par 
\par "Let's stay here and watch the fun for ourselves," Kiel said. 
\par 
\par Garan frowned. "Do you want to be the one to explain to Rabban why 
\par we're late returning from patrol?" 
\par 
\par "Let's go," Kiel answered quickly. 
\par 
\par As the worm-poison infused the cistern, the Harkonnen troopers 
\par hurried back to their ornithopter, reluctantly content to let the villagers 
\par discover the prank for themselves.

\par 
\par 
\par It is said that the Fremen has no conscience, having lost it in a burning 
\par desire for revenge. This is foolish. Only the rawest primitive and the 
\par sociopath have no conscience. The Fremen possesses a highly evolved 
\par world view centered on the welfare of his people. His sense of 
\par belonging to the community is almost stronger than his sense of self. It 
\par is only to outsiders that these desert-dwellers seem brutish ... just as

\par 
\par -Pardot Kynes, The People of Arrakis
\par 
\par 
\par "Luxury is for the noble-born, Liet," Pardot Kynes, Imperial 
\par Planetologist to Arrakis, said to his son as the groundcar trundled 
\par across the uneven ground. "On this planet you must instantly become 
\par aware of your own surroundings, and remain alert at all times. If you 
\par fail to learn this lesson, you won't live long." 
\par 
\par As Kynes operated the simple controls, he gestured toward the buttery 
\par morning light that melted across the stark dunes. "There are rewards 
\par here, too." Kynes exhaled a long breath between his hard chapped lips. 
\par 
\par Young Liet stared out the scratched windowplaz. Unlike his father, 
\par who reeled off whatever random thoughts occurred to him, making 
\par pronouncements that the Fremen heeded as if they were weighty 
\par spiritual matters, Liet preferred silence. He narrowed his eyes to study 
\par the landscape, searching for any small thing out of its place. Always 
\par alert. 
\par 
\par On such a harsh planet, one had to develop stored perceptions, each of 
\par them linked to every moment of survival. Though his father was much 
\par older, Liet wasn't certain the Planetologist understood as much as he 
\par himself did. The mind of Pardot Kynes contained powerful concepts, 
\par but the older man experienced them only as esoteric data. He didn't 
\par understand the desert in his heart or in his soul... 
\par 
\par For years, Kynes had lived among the Fremen. It was said that Emperor 
\par Shaddam IV had little interest in his activities, and since Kynes asked 
\par for no funding and few supplies, the Emperor and the Harkonnens left 
\par him alone. With each passing year he slipped farther from attention. 
\par Shaddam and his advisors had stopped expecting any grand revelations 
\par from the Planetologist's periodic reports. 
\par 
\par This suited Pardot Kynes, and his son as well. 
\par 
\par In his wanderings, Kynes often made trips to outlying villages where 
\par the people of the pan and graben scratched out squalid lives. True 
\par Fremen rarely mixed with the townspeople, and viewed them with 
\par veiled contempt for being too soft, too civilized. Liet would never have 
\par lived in those pathetic settlements for all the solaris in the Imperium. 
\par But still, Pardot visited them. 
\par 
\par Eschewing roads and commonly traveled paths, they rode in the 
\par groundcar, checking meteorological stations and collecting data, though 
\par Pardot's troops of devoted Fremen would gladly have done this menial 
\par work for their "Umma," or prophet. 
\par 
\par Liet-Kynes's features echoed many of his father's, though with a leaner 
\par face and the close-set eyes of his Fremen mother. He had pale hair, and 
\par his chin was still smooth, though later he would likely grow a beard 
\par similar to the great Planetologist's. Liet's eyes had the deep blue of 
\par spice addiction, since every meal and breath of air was laced with 
\par melange. 
\par 
\par Liet heard a sharp intake of breath from his father as they passed the 
\par jagged elbow of a canyon where camouflaged catchtraps directed 
\par moisture to plantings of rabbitbush and poverty grasses. "See? It's 
\par taking on a life of its own. We'll 'cycle' the planet through prairie phase 
\par into forest over several generations. The sand has a high salt content, 
\par indicating old oceans, and the spice itself is alkaline." He chuckled. 
\par "People in the Imperium would be horrified that we'd use spice 
\par byproducts for something as menial as fertilizer." He smiled at his son. 
\par "But we know the value of such things, eh? If we break down the spice, 
\par we can set up protein digestion. Even now, if we flew high enough, we 
\par could spot patches of green where matted plant growth holds the dune 
\par faces in place." 
\par 
\par The young man sighed. His father was a great man with magnificent 
\par dreams for Dune-and yet Kynes was so focused on one thing that he 
\par failed to see the universe around him. Liet knew that if any Harkonnen 
\par patrols found the plantings, they would destroy them and punish the 
\par Fremen. 
\par 
\par Though only twelve, Liet regularly went out on guerrilla raids with his 
\par Fremen brothers and had already killed Harkonnens. For more than a 
\par year, he and his friends-led by the brash Stilgar-had struck targets 
\par that others refused to consider. Only a week before, Liet's companions 
\par had blown up a dozen patrol 'thopters at a supply post. Unfortunately, 
\par the stupid Harkonnen troops had taken their revenge against poor 
\par villagers, seeing no difference between settled folk and the will-o'-the-
\par sand Fremen. 
\par 
\par He hadn't told his father about his guerrilla activities, since the elder 
\par Kynes wouldn't understand the necessity. Premeditated violence, for 
\par whatever reason, was a foreign concept to the Planetologist. But Liet 
\par would do what needed to be done. 
\par 
\par Now, the groundcar approached a village tucked into the rocky 
\par foothills; it was called Bilar Camp on their terrain maps. Pardot 
\par continued to talk about melange and its peculiar properties. "They 
\par found spice too soon on Arrakis. It deflected scientific inquiry. It was 
\par so useful right from the outset that no one bothered to probe its 
\par mysteries." 
\par 
\par Liet turned to look at him. "I thought that was why you were assigned 
\par here in the first place-to understand the spice." 
\par 
\par "Yes ... but we have more important work to do. I still report back to 
\par the Imperium often enough to convince them I'm working at my job ... 
\par though not very successfully." Talking about the first time he'd been to 
\par this region, he drove toward a cluster of dirty buildings the color of 
\par sand and dust. 
\par 
\par The groundcar jounced over a rough rock, but Liet ignored it and stared 
\par ahead at the village, squinting his eyes in the harsh light of the desert 
\par morning. The morning air held the fragility of fine crystal. 
\par "Something's wrong," he said, interrupting his father. 
\par 
\par Kynes continued talking for a few seconds and then brought the vehicle 
\par to a stop. "What's that?" 
\par 
\par "Something is wrong." Liet pointed ahead at the village. 
\par 
\par Kynes shaded his eyes against the glare. "I don't see anything." 
\par 
\par "Still ... let us proceed with caution." 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par \'b7 \'b7 \'b7 \'b7 \'b7  
\par 
\par 
\par In the center of the village, they encountered a festival of horrors. 
\par 
\par The noise was appalling, as was the smell. Bodies lay sprawled on the 
\par ground like squashed insects, arms and legs stiffened at odd angles, 
\par while tortured survivors wandered about as if insane, shrieking and 
\par snarling like animals. They had ripped hair out of their heads in bloody 
\par clumps. Some used long fingernails to claw the eyes out of their faces, 
\par then held the scooped eyeballs in their palms; blind, they staggered 
\par against the tan walls of dwellings, leaving wet crimson smears. 
\par 
\par Even the dead ones did not look at peace. 
\par 
\par "By Shai-Hulud!" Liet whispered under his breath, while his father let 
\par out a louder curse in common Imperial Galach. 
\par 
\par One man with torn eye sockets like bloody extra mouths above his 
\par cheekbones collided with a crawling woman; both victims flew into a 
\par rage and ripped at each other's skin with bare hands, biting and spitting 
\par and screaming. There were muddy spots on the street, overturned 
\par containers of water. 
\par 
\par Some buildings were locked and shuttered, barricaded against the 
\par crazed wretches outside who pounded on the walls, wailing wordlessly 
\par to get in. On an upper floor Liet saw a woman's terrified face at the 
\par dust-streaked windowplaz. Others hid, somehow unaffected by the 
\par murderous insanity. 
\par 
\par "We must help these people, Father." Liet leaped out of the sealed 
\par groundcar before his father had brought it to a complete stop. "Bring 
\par your weapons. We may need to defend ourselves." 
\par 
\par They carried old maula pistols as well as knives. His father, though a 
\par scientist at heart, was also a good fighter-a skill he reserved for 
\par defending his vision for Arrakis. The legend was told of how he had 
\par slain several Harkonnen bravos who'd been attempting to kill three 
\par young Fremen. Those rescued Fremen were now his most loyal 
\par lieutenants, Stilgar, Turok, and Ommun. But Pardot Kynes had never 
\par fought against anything like this... 
\par 
\par The maddened villagers noticed them and moaned. They began to 
\par move forward. 
\par 
\par "Don't kill them unless you must," Kynes said, amazed at how quickly 
\par his son had armed himself with a crysknife and maula pistol. "Watch 
\par yourself." 
\par 
\par Liet ventured into the street. What struck him first was the terrible 
\par stink, as if the foul breath of a dying leper had been captured in a bottle 
\par and slowly released. 
\par 
\par Staring in disbelief, Pardot stepped farther from the groundcar. He saw 
\par no lasgun burn marks in the village, no chip scars from projectile 
\par weapons, nothing that would have indicated an overt Harkonnen attack. 
\par Was it a disease? If so, it might be contagious. If a plague or some kind 
\par of communicable insanity was at work here, he could not let the 
\par Fremen take these bodies for the deathstills. 
\par 
\par Liet moved forward. "Fremen would attribute this to demons." 
\par 
\par Two of the bloody-faced victims let out demonic shrieks and rushed 
\par toward them, their fingers outstretched like eagle claws, their mouths 
\par open like bottomless pits. Liet pointed the maula pistol, closed his eyes 
\par to utter a quick prayer, then fired twice. The perfect shots hit each of 
\par the attackers in the chest, and they fell dead. 
\par 
\par Liet bowed. "Forgive me, Shai-Hulud." 
\par 
\par Pardot watched him. I have tried to teach my son many things, but at 
\par least he has learned compassion. All other information can be learned 
\par from filmbooks ... but not compassion. This was born into him. 
\par 
\par The young man bent over the two bodies, studied them closely, pushing 
\par back his superstitious fear. "I do not think it's a disease." He looked 
\par back at Pardot. "I've assisted the healers, as you know, and ..." His 
\par voice trailed off. 
\par 
\par "What, then?" 
\par 
\par "I believe they've been poisoned." 
\par 
\par One by one, the tortured villagers wandering the dusty streets fell onto 
\par their backs in screaming convulsions, until only three remained alive. 
\par Liet moved quickly with the crysknife and dispatched the last victims 
\par painlessly and efficiently. No tribe or village would ever accept them 
\par again, no matter how much they recovered, for fear that they had been 
\par corrupted by demons; even their water would be considered tainted. 
\par 
\par Liet found it odd how easily he had taken command in front of his 
\par father. He gestured toward two of the sealed buildings. "Convince the 
\par people inside those barred dwellings that we mean them no harm. We 
\par must discover what happened here." His voice became low and icy. 
\par "And we must learn who is to blame." 
\par 
\par Pardot Kynes moved to the dusty building. Fingernail scratches and 
\par bloody handprints marked the mud-brick walls and pitted metal doors 
\par where crazed victims had tried to pound their way in. He swallowed 
\par hard and prepared to make his case, to convince the terrified survivors 
\par that their ordeal was over. He turned back to his son. "Where will you 
\par be, Liet?" 
\par 
\par The young man looked at an overturned water container. He knew of 
\par only one way the poison could affect so many people at once. 
\par "Checking the water supply." 
\par 
\par His face etched with concern, Pardot nodded. 
\par 
\par Liet studied the terrain around the village, saw a faint trail leading up 
\par the side of the overhanging mesa. Yes, they had hidden a qanat there, 
\par their own emergency water supply. 
\par 
\par Moving with the speed of a sun-warmed lizard, he scurried up the 
\par mountain path and reached the cistern. The evidence of its location had 
\par been cleverly disguised, though the villagers had made many errors. 
\par Even a clumsy Harkonnen patrol could have discovered the illegal 
\par reservoir. He studied the area quickly, noting patterns in the sand. 
\par 
\par Smelling a harsh alkaloid bitterness near the upper opening of the 
\par cistern, he tried to place the odor. He'd experienced it rarely, and only 
\par during great celebrations in the sietch, the Fremen hidden communities. 
\par The Water of Life! The Fremen people consumed such a substance 
\par only after a Sayyadina had converted the exhalation of a drowned 
\par worm, using her own body chemistry as a catalyst to create a tolerable 
\par drug that sent the sietch community into an ecstatic frenzy. 
\par Unconverted, the substance was a ferocious toxin. 
\par 
\par The villagers in Bilar Camp had drunk pure Water of Life, before it 
\par was transformed. Someone had done this intentionally ... poisoning 
\par them. 
\par 
\par Then he saw the marks of ornithopter pads in the soft soil atop the 
\par plateau. It had to be a Harkonnen 'thopter. One of the regular patrols 
\par ... a practical joke? 
\par 
\par Frowning grimly, Liet descended to the devastated village, where his 
\par father had succeeded in bringing out the survivors who had barricaded 
\par themselves within their dwellings. Through luck, these people had not 
\par drunk the poisoned water. Now they fell to their knees in the streets, 
\par surrounded by the awful carnage. Their keening cries of grief drifted 
\par like the thin wails of ghosts along a sheer cliffside. 
\par 
\par Harkonnens did this. 
\par 
\par Pardot Kynes moved about doing what he could to comfort them, but 
\par from the quizzical expressions on the villagers' faces, Liet knew his 
\par father was probably saying the wrong things, expressing his sympathy 
\par in abstract concepts that they had no ability to understand. 
\par 
\par Liet moved down the slope, and already plans were forming in his 
\par mind. As soon as they returned to the sietch, he would meet with 
\par Stilgar and his commando squad. 
\par 
\par And they would plan their retaliation against the Harkonnens...

\par 
\par -Fremen saying
\par 
\par 
\par As the first moon rose copper-red over the desert horizon, Liet-Kynes 
\par and seven Fremen departed the rocks and made their way out to the soft 
\par curving dunes where they could be easily seen. 
\par 
\par "Prepare yourselves," Stilgar said, his narrow face like a desert hawk's 
\par in the moonlight. His pupils had dilated, making his solid blue eyes 
\par look black. He wrapped his desert camouflage around him, as did the 
\par other, older guerrillas. "It is said that when one waits for vengeance, 
\par time passes slowly but sweetly." 
\par 
\par Liet-Kynes nodded. He was dressed to look like a weak, water-fat 
\par village boy, but his eyes were as hard as Velan steel. Beside him, his 
\par sietch-mate and blood-brother Warrick, a slightly taller lad, nodded as 
\par well. This night, the two would pretend to be helpless children caught 
\par out in the open ... irresistible targets for the anticipated Harkonnen 
\par patrol. 
\par 
\par "We do what must be done, Stil." Liet clapped a hand on Warrick's 
\par padded shoulder. These twelve-year-olds had already blooded more 
\par than a hundred Harkonnens apiece, and would have stopped keeping 
\par count, except for their friendly rivalry with each other. "I trust my 
\par brother with my life." 
\par 
\par Warrick covered Liet's hand with his own. "Liet would be afraid to die 
\par without me at his side." 
\par 
\par "With or without you, Warrick, I don't plan to die this night," Liet said, 
\par which elicited a deep laugh from his companion. "I plan to exact 
\par revenge." 
\par 
\par After the orgy of poisoned death had fallen upon Bilar Camp, Fremen 
\par rage had spread from sietch to sietch like water soaking into sand. From 
\par the 'thopter markings found near the hidden cistern, they knew who was 
\par responsible. All Harkonnens must pay. 
\par 
\par Around Carthag and Arsunt, word had been passed to timid-looking 
\par workers and dusty servants placed inside Harkonnen strongholds. Some 
\par of the infiltrators scrubbed the floors of troop barracks using dry rags 
\par and abrasives. Others posed as water sellers supplying the occupation 
\par force. 
\par 
\par As the tale of the poisoned village passed from one Harkonnen soldier 
\par to another in progressively exaggerated anecdotes, the Fremen 
\par informants noted who derived the greatest pleasure from the news. 
\par They studied the crew assignments and route logs of Harkonnen 
\par patrols. Before long, they had learned exactly which Harkonnen 
\par troopers were responsible. And where they could be found... 
\par 
\par With a high-pitched squeak and a dancing blur of gossamer wings, a 
\par tiny distrans bat swooped from an observation outcropping in the 
\par mountains behind them. When Stilgar held up a hand, the bat landed on 
\par his forearm, primly folding its wings and waiting for a reward. 
\par 
\par Stilgar drew a tiny drop of water from the sipping tube at his throat and 
\par let the moisture fall into the open mouth of the bat. Then he brought 
\par forth a thin cylinder and placed it to his ear, listening as the bat emitted 
\par complex, wavering squeaks. Stilgar tapped the bat on its head, then 
\par flung it into the night air again, like a falconer releasing his bird. 
\par 
\par He turned back to his expectant troop, a predatory smile on his 
\par moonshadowed face. "Their ornithopter has been seen over the ridge. 
\par The Harkonnens fly a predictable path as they scan the desert. But they 
\par have been on patrol for so long, they are complacent. They do not see 
\par their own patterns." 
\par 
\par "Tonight, they fly into a web of death," Warrick said from the dune top, 
\par lifting his fist into the air in a very un-boy-like gesture. 
\par 
\par The Fremen checked their weapons, loosed crysknives in sheaths at 
\par their sides, tested the strength of garroting cords, preparing. With 
\par swishing robes, they erased all marks of their passage. Leaving the two 
\par young men alone. 
\par 
\par Stilgar looked up at the night sky, and a muscle on his jaw flickered. 
\par "This I learned from Umma Kynes. When we were cataloguing lichens, 
\par we saw a rock lizard that seemed to vanish before our eyes. Kynes said, 
\par 'I give you the chameleon, whose ability to match itself with its 
\par background tells you all you need to know about the roots of ecology 
\par and the foundations of personal identity.' " Stilgar looked gravely at his 
\par men, and his expression faltered. "I don't know exactly what he meant 
\par ... but now we must all become chameleons of the desert." 
\par 
\par Wearing light-colored clothes, Liet stepped up the slipface of the dune, 
\par leaving deliberate, painfully apparent footprints. Warrick followed just 
\par as clumsily, while the other Fremen spread out on the flat sand. After 
\par pulling out breathing tubes and covering their faces with loose hoods, 
\par they flailed their arms in a blur of motion. Powdery sand engulfed 
\par them, and then they lay still. 
\par 
\par Liet and Warrick ran about, smoothing wrinkles on the surface and 
\par leaving nothing but their own footprints. They finished just as the 
\par patrol 'thopter whirred over the line of rocks, flashing red lights. 
\par 
\par The two white-clad Fremen froze out in the open, their bright clothes 
\par unmistakable against the pale, moonlit sand. No true Fremen would 
\par ever be caught in such a show of clumsiness ... but the Harkonnens 
\par didn't know that. They would not suspect. 
\par 
\par As soon as the 'thopter came into view, Liet made an exaggerated 
\par gesture of alarm. "Come on, Warrick. Let's make a good show of it." 
\par The two ran away pell-mell, as if in a panic. 
\par 
\par Predictably, the 'thopter circled to intercept them. A powerful spotlight 
\par flooded down, then a laughing sidegunner leaned out of the 'thopter. He 
\par fired his lasgun twice, sketching a line of melted glass upon the surface 
\par of the sand. 
\par 
\par Liet and Warrick tumbled down the steep side of a dune. The gunner 
\par fired three more blasts, missing them each time. 
\par 
\par The 'thopter landed on the broad surface of a nearby dune ... close to 
\par where Stilgar and his men had buried themselves. Liet and Warrick 
\par flashed each other a smile, and prepared for the second part of the 
\par game. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par \'b7 \'b7 \'b7 \'b7 \'b7  
\par 
\par 
\par Sidegunner Kiel shouldered his still-hot lasgun rifle and popped open 
\par the door. "Let's go hunt some Fremen." He jumped onto the sand as 
\par soon as Garan had landed the patrol craft. 
\par 
\par Behind them, the fresh-faced recruit Josten fumbled for his own 
\par weapon. "It would be easier just to shoot them from above." 
\par 
\par "What kind of sport would that be?" Garan asked in his gruff voice. 
\par 
\par "Or is it just that you don't want blood on your new uniform, kid?" Kiel 
\par called over his shoulder. They stood beside the armored craft looking 
\par across the moonlit dunes, where the two scrawny nomads stumbled 
\par away (as if they had any hope of escape once a Harkonnen trooper 
\par decided to target them). 
\par 
\par Garan grabbed his weapon, and the three of them strode across the 
\par sands. The two Fremen youths scuttled like beetles, but the threat of the 
\par troops might cause them to turn around and surrender ... or better yet, 
\par fight like cornered rats. 
\par 
\par "I've heard stories about these Fremen." Josten panted as he kept up 
\par with the two older men. "Their children are said to be killers, and their 
\par women will torture you in ways that even Piter de Vries couldn't 
\par imagine." 
\par 
\par Kiel gave a rude snort of laughter. "We've got lasguns, Josten. What are 
\par they going to do-throw rocks at us?" 
\par 
\par "Some of them carry maula pistols." 
\par 
\par Garan looked back at the young recruit, then gave a shrug. "Why don't 
\par you go back to the 'thopter and get our stunner, then? We can use a 
\par wide field if things get bad." 
\par 
\par "Yeah," Kiel said, "that way we can make this last longer." The two 
\par white-clad Fremen continued to flounder across the sand, and the 
\par Harkonnen troopers closed the distance with purposeful strides. 
\par 
\par Glad for the opportunity to be away from the fight, Josten sprinted over 
\par the dune toward the waiting 'thopter. From the dune top, he looked 
\par back at his companions, then rushed to the darkened craft. As he 
\par ducked inside, he encountered a man clad in desert tans, hands flicking 
\par across the controls with the speed of a snake on a hot plate. 
\par 
\par "Hey, what are you-" Josten cried. 
\par 
\par In the cabin light he saw that the figure had a narrow leathery face. The 
\par eyes captivated him: blue-within-blue, with the sharp intensity of a man 
\par accustomed to killing. Before Josten could react, his arm was grabbed 
\par with a grip as strong as an eagle's talon, and he was dragged deeper into 
\par the cockpit. The Fremen's other hand flashed, and he saw a curved, 
\par milky-blue knife strike up. A bright icicle of pain slashed into his 
\par throat, all the way back to his spine-then the knife was gone before 
\par even a droplet of blood could cling to its surface. 
\par 
\par Like a scorpion that had just unleashed its sting, the Fremen backed up. 
\par Josten fell forward, already feeling red death spreading from his throat. 
\par He tried to say something, to ask a question that seemed all-important 
\par to him, but his words only came out as a gurgle. The Fremen snatched 
\par something from his stillsuit and pressed it against the young man's 
\par throat, an absorbent cloth that drank his blood as it spilled. 
\par 
\par Was the desert man saving him? A bandage? A flash of hope rose in 
\par Josten's mind. Had it all been a mistake? Was this gaunt native trying to 
\par make amends? 
\par 
\par But Josten's blood pumped out too quickly and forcefully for any 
\par medical help. As his life faded, he realized that the absorbent pack had 
\par never been meant as a wound dressing, but simply to capture every 
\par droplet of blood for its moisture... 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par \'b7 \'b7 \'b7 \'b7 \'b7  
\par 
\par 
\par When Kiel came to within firing distance of the two Fremen youths, 
\par Garan looked back into the moonlight. "I thought I heard something 
\par from the 'thopter." 
\par 
\par "Probably Josten tripping on his own feet," the sidegunner said, not 
\par lowering his weapon. 
\par 
\par The trapped Fremen staggered to a halt across a shallow pan of soft 
\par sand. They crouched and pulled out small, clumsy-looking knives. 
\par 
\par Kiel laughed out loud. "What do you mean to do with those? Pick your 
\par teeth?" 
\par 
\par "I'll pick the teeth from your dead body," one of the boys shouted. "Got 
\par any old-fashioned gold molars we can sell in Arrakeen?" 
\par 
\par Garan chortled and looked at his companion. "This is going to be fun." 
\par Moving in lockstep, the troopers marched into the flat sandy area. 
\par 
\par As they closed to within five meters, the sand around them erupted. 
\par Human forms popped out of the dust, covered with grit-tan human 
\par silhouettes, like animated corpses boiling up from a graveyard. 
\par 
\par Garan let out a useless warning cry, and Kiel fired once with his lasgun, 
\par burning down one of the men. Then the dusty forms surged forward. 
\par Clustering around the pilot, they pressed in so close that he couldn't 
\par bring his lasgun to bear. They attacked him like blood-lice on an open 
\par wound. 
\par 
\par As they drove Garan to his knees, he cried out in the manner of an old 
\par woman. The Fremen restrained him so that he could do little more than 
\par breathe and blink his eyes. And scream. 
\par 
\par One of the white-clad "victims" hurried forward. The young man held 
\par out the small knife that Garan and Kiel had snickered at just moments 
\par ago. The youth darted downward, jabbing with the tip of the blade-but 
\par with precise control, as gentle as a kiss-to gouge out both of Garan's 
\par eyes, transforming his sockets into red Oedipal stains. 
\par 
\par Stilgar barked out a command, "Bind him and keep him. We shall bring 
\par this one back to our sietch alive, and let the women take care of him in 
\par their own way." 
\par 
\par Garan screamed again... 
\par 
\par When the Fremen rushed forward to attack Kiel, the sidegunner 
\par responded by swinging his weapon like a club. As clawing hands 
\par grabbed for it, he surprised them by releasing the lasrifle. The Fremen 
\par who clutched the gun fell backward, caught off balance by the 
\par unexpected action. 
\par 
\par Then Kiel began to run. Fighting would do him no good here. They had 
\par already taken Garan, and he assumed Josten was dead back at the 
\par 'thopter. So he left the Fremen, running as he had never run before. He 
\par sprinted across the night sands away from the rocks, away from the 
\par 'thopter ... and out into the open desert. The Fremen might be able to 
\par catch him, but he would give them a run for it. 
\par 
\par Panting, leaving his companions behind, Kiel raced across the dunes 
\par with no plan and no thought other than to flee farther and farther 
\par away... 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par \'b7 \'b7 \'b7 \'b7 \'b7  
\par 
\par 
\par "We've captured the 'thopter intact, Stil," Warrick said, flushed with 
\par adrenaline and quite proud of himself. The commando leader nodded 
\par grimly. Umma Kynes would be exceedingly pleased at the news. He 
\par could always use a 'thopter for his agricultural inspections, and he 
\par didn't need to know where it came from. 
\par 
\par Liet looked down at the blinded captive, whose gouged eye sockets had 
\par been covered by a cloth. "I saw what the Harkonnens did to Bilar Camp 
\par with my own eyes ... the poisoned cistern, the tainted water." The other 
\par body had already been packed in the rear of the patrol 'thopter to be 
\par taken to the deathstills. "This doesn't pay back a tenth part of the 
\par suffering." 
\par 
\par Going to his blood brother's side, Warrick made a face of disgust. 
\par "Such is my scorn that I don't even want to take their water for our 
\par tribe." 
\par 
\par Stilgar glowered at him as if he had spoken sacrilege. "You would 
\par prefer to let them mummify in the sands, to let their water go wasted 
\par into the air? It would be an insult to Shai-Hulud." 
\par 
\par Warrick bowed his head. "It was only my anger speaking, Stil. I did not 
\par mean it." 
\par 
\par Stilgar looked up at the ruddy rising moon. }{\f44\fs28\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609 The entire ambush had 
\par }{\f44\fs28\lang1033\langfe1049\langnp1033\insrsid13253941\charrsid10639609 lasted less than an hour. "We shall perform the ritual of tal hai so that 
\par their souls will never rest. They will be damned to walk the desert for 
\par all eternity." Then his voice became harsh and fearful. "But we must 
\par take extra care to cover our tracks, so that we do not lead their ghosts 
\par back to our sietch." 
\par 
\par The Fremen muttered as superstitious fear dampened their vengeful 
\par pleasure. Stilgar intoned the ancient chant, while others drew designs in 
\par the sand, labyrinthine power-shapes that would bind the spirits of the 
\par cursed men to the dunes forever. 
\par 
\par Out across the moonlit sands they could still see the clumsily running 
\par figure of the remaining trooper. "That one is our offering to Shai-
\par Hulud," Stilgar said, finishing his chant. The tal hai curse was 
\par complete. "The world will be at balance, and the desert will be 
\par pleased." 
\par 
\par "He's chugging like a broken crawler." Liet stood next to Stilgar, 
\par drawing himself up, though he was still small compared to the 
\par commando leader. "It won't be long now." 
\par 
\par They gathered their supplies. As many as possible piled into the patrol 
\par 'thopter, while the remaining Fremen slipped back across the sands. 
\par They used a well-practiced random gait so that their footsteps made no 
\par sound that was not natural to the desert. 
\par 
\par The Harkonnen sidegunner continued to flee in a blind panic. By now, 
\par he might be entertaining a hope of escape, though the direction of his 
\par flight across the ocean of dunes would take him nowhere. 
\par 
\par Within minutes, a worm came for him.

\par 
\par Arrakis, in the year 10,191 of the Imperial calendar. Arrakis . . 
. forever known as Dune....The cave in the massive shield wall was dark and dry, sealed by an avalanche. The air tasted like rock dust. The surviving Atreides soldiers huddled in blackness to conserve energy, letting their glowglobe powerpacks recycle.

\par Outside, the Harkormen shelling hammered against the bolthole where they had fled for safety. Artillery? What a surprise to be attacked by such seemingly obsolete technology ... and yet, it was effective. Damned effective.
\par In pockets of silence that lasted on
ly seconds, the young recruit Elto Vitt lay in pain listening to the wheezing of wounded, terrified men. The stale, oppressive air pressed heavy on him, increasing the broken-glass agony in his lungs. He tasted blood in his mouth, an unwelcome moisture in
 the absolute dryness.
\par His uncle, Sergeant Hoh Vitt, had not honestly told him how severe his injuries were, emphasizing Elto's "youthful resilience and stamina." Elto suspected he must be dying, and he wasn't alone in that predicament. These last soldiers 
were all dying, if not from their injuries, then from hunger or thirst.
\par Thirst.
\par A man's voice cut the darkness, a gunner named Deegan. "I wonder if Duke Leto got away. I hope he's safe."
\par A reassuring grunt. "Thufir Hawat would slit his own throat before he
'd let the Baron touch our Duke, or young Paul." It was the signalman Scovich, fiddling with the flexible hip cages that held two captive distrans bats, creatures whose nervous systems could carry message imprints.
\par "Bloody Harkonnens!' Then Deegan's sigh became a sob. "I wish we were back home on Caladan."
\par Supply sergeant Vitt was no more than a disembodied voice in the darkness, cornfortingly close to his injured young nephew. "Do you hear a whisper of Caladan seas, Elto? Do you hear the waves, the tides?"
\par The boy concentrated hard. Indeed, the relentless artillery shelling sounded like the booming of breakers against the glistening black rocks below the cliff-perch of Castle Caladan.
\par "Maybe," he said. But he didn't, not really. The similarity was only slig
ht, and his uncle, a Master Jongleur ... a storyteller extraordinaire ... wasn't up to his capabilities, though here he couldn't have asked for a more attentive audience. Instead the sergeant seemed stunned by events, and uncharacteristically quiet, not h
is usual gregarious self.
\par Elto remembered running barefoot along the beaches on Caladan, the Atreides home planet far, far from this barren repository of dunes, sandworms, and precious spice. As a child, he had tiptoed in the foamy residue of waves, avoidin
g the tiny pincers of crabfish so numerous that he could net enough for a fine meal in - only a few minutes.
\par Those memories were much more vivid than what had just happened....
\par The alarms had rung in the middle of the night, ironically during the first dee
p sleep Elto Vitt had managed in the Atreides barracks at Arrakeen. Only a month earlier, he and other recruits had been assigned to this desolate planet, saying their farewells to lush Caladan. Duke Leto Atreides had received the governorship of Arrakis,
 the only known source of the spice melange, as a boon from the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV.
\par To many of the loyal Atreides soldiers, it had seemed a great financial coup-they had known nothing of politics ... or of danger. Apparently Duke Leto had not been 
aware of the peril here either, because he'd brought along his concubine Lady Jessica and their fifteen-year-old son, Paul.
\par When the warning bells shrieked, Elto snapped awake androlled from his bunk bed. His uncle, Hoh Vitt, already in full sergeant's reg
alia, shouted for everyone to hurry, hurry! The Atreides house guard grabbed their uniforms, kits, and weapons. Elto recalled allowing himself a groan, annoyed at another apparent drill ... and yet hoping it was only that.
\par The burly, disfigured weapons master Gurney Halleck burst into the barracks, his voice booming commands. He was flushed with anger, and the beet-colored inkvine scar stood out like a lightning bolt on his face. \'93House shi
elds are down! We're vulnerable!" Security teams had supposedly rooted out all the booby traps, spyeyes, and assassination devices left behind by the hated Harkonnen predecessors. Now the lumpish Halleck became a frenzy of barked orders.
\par Explosions sounded outside, shaking the barracks and rattling armor-plaz windows. Enemy assault thopters swooped in over the Shield Wall, probably coming from a Harkormen base in the city of Carthag.
\par "Prepare your weapons!" Halleck bellowed. The buzzing of lasguns played across the stone walls of Arrakeen, incinerating buildings. Orange eruptions shattered plaz windows, decapitated observation towers. "We must defend House Atreides."
\par "For the Dukel" Uncle Hoh cried.
\par Elto yanked on the sleeve of his black uniform, tugging the trim into place, adjusting the red Atreides hawk crest and red cap 
of the corps. Everyone else had already jammed feet into boots, slapped charge packs into lasgun rifles. Elto scrambled to catch up, his mind awhirl. His uncle had pulled strings to get him assigned here as part of the elite corps. The other men were lean
 and whipcord strong, the finest hand-picked Atreides troops. He didn't belong with them.
\par Young Elto had been excited to leave Caladan for Arrakis, so far away. He had never ridden on a Guild Heighliner before, had never been close to a mutated Navigator wh
o could fold space with his mind. Before leaving his ocean home, Elto had spent only a few months watching the men train, eating with them, sleeping in the barracks, listening to their colorful, bawdy tales of great battles past and duties performed in th
e service of the Atreides dukes.
\par Elto had never felt in danger on Caladan, but after only a short time on Arrakis, all the men had grown grim and uneasy. There had been unsettling rumors and suspicious events. Earlier that night, as the troops had bunked do
wn, they'd been agitated, but unwilling to speak of it, either because of their commander's sharp orders or because the soldiers didn't know enough details. Or maybe they were just giving Elto, the untried and unproven new comrade, a cold shoulder....

\par Beca
use of the circumstances of his recruitment, a few men of the elite corps hadn't taken to Elto. Instead, they'd openly grumbled about his amateur skills, wondering why Duke Leto had permitted such a novice to join them. A signalman and communications spec
i
alist named Foffie Scovich, pretending to be friendly, had filled the boy with false information as an illconceived joke. Uncle Hoh had put a stop to that, for with his Jongleur's talent for the quick, whispered story-always told without witnesses because
 f the ancient prohibition -he could have given any of the men terrible nightmares for weeks ... and they all knew it.
\par The men in the Atreides elite corps feared and respected their supply sergeant, but even the most accommodating of them gave his nephew no
 preferential treatment. Anyone could see that Elto Vitt was not one of them, not one of their rough-andtumble, hard-fighting breed....
\par By the time the Atreides house guard rushed out of the barracks, they were naked to aerial attack from the lack of house
 shields. The men knew the vulnerability couldn't possibly be from a mere equipment failure, not after what they'd been hearing, what they'd been feeling. How could Duke Leto Atreides, with all of his proven abilities, have permitted this to happen?

\par Enraged, Gurney Halleck grumbled loudly, "Aye, we have a traitor in our midsCIlluminated in floodlights, Harkonnen troops in blue uniforms swarmed over the compound. More enemy transports disgorged assault teams.
\par Elto held his lasgun rifle, trying to remember th
e drills and training sessions. Someday, if he survived, his uncle would compose a vivid story about this battle, conjuring up images of smoke sounds, and fires, as well as Atreides valor and loyalty to the Duke.
\par Atreides soldiers raced through the streets
, dodging explosions, fighting hard to defend. Lasguns sliced vivid blue arcs across the night. The elite corps joined the fray, howling-but Elto could already see they were vastly outnumbered by this massive surprise assault. Without shields, Arrakeen ha
d already been struck a mortal blow.
\par Elto blinked his eyes in the cave, saw light. A flicker of hope dissipated as he realized it was only a recharged glowglobe floating in the air over his head. Not daylight. Still trapped in their tomb of rock, the Atreid
es soldiers listened to the continued thuds of artillery. Dust and debris trickled from the shuddering ceiling. Elto tried to keep his spirits high, but knew House Atreides must have fallen by now.
\par His uncle sat nearby, staring into space. A long red scratch jagged across one cheek.
\par During brief inspection drills while settling in, Elto had met the other important men in Duke Leto's security staff besides Gurney Halleck, especially the renowned Swordmaster Duncan Idaho and the old Mentat assassin Thufir Haw
at. The blackhaired Duke inspired such loyalty in his men, exuded such supreme confidence, that Elto had never imagined this mighty man could fall.
\par One of the security experts had been trapped here with the rest of the detachment. Now Scovich confronted hi
m, his voice gruff and challenging. "How did the house shields get shut off? It must have been a traitor, someone you overlooked." The distrans bats seemed agitated in their cages at Scovich's waist.
\par "We spared no effort checking the palace," the man said,
 more tired than defensive. "There were dozens of traps, mechanical and human. When the bunter-seeker almost killed Master Paul, Thufir Hawat offered his resignation, but the Duke refused to accept it."
\par "Well, you didn't find all the traps," Scovich groused, probing for an excuse to fight. "You were supposed to keep the Harkonnens out."
\par Sergeant Hoh Vitt stepped between the two men before they could come to blows. We can't afford to be at each other's throats. We need to work together to get out of this."
\par But Elto saw on the faces of the men that they all knew otherwise: they would never escape this death trap.
\par The unit's muscular battlefield engineer, Avrarn Fultz, paced about in the faint light, using a jury-rigged instrument to measure the thickness of ro
ck and dirt around them. "Three meters of solid stone." He turned toward the fallen boulders that had covered the cave entr! nce. "Down to two and a half here, but it's dangerously unstable'
\par "If we went out the front, we'd run headlong into Harkormen shelling anyway," the gunner Deegan said. His voice trembled with tension, like a too-tight baliset string about to break.
\par Uncle Hoh activated a second glowglobe, which floated in the air behind him as he went to a bend in the tunnel. "If I remember the arrangement of the tunnels, on the other side of this wall there's a supply cache. Food, medical supplies ... water."
\par Fultz ran his scanner over the thick stone. Elto, unable to move on his makeshift bed and fuzzed with painkillers, stared at the process, realizing how much it reminded him of Caladan fishermen using depth sounders in the reef fishing grounds.
\par "You picked a good, secure spot for those supplies, Sergeant," Fultz said. "Four meters of solid rock. The cave-ins have cut us off."
\par Deegan, his voice edged with hysteria, groaned. "That food and water might as well be in the Imperial Palace on Kaitain. This place ... Arrakis ... isn't right for us Atreides!"
\par The gunner was right, Elto thought. Atreides soldiers were tough, but like fish out of water in this hostile environment.
\par "I was never comfortable here," Deegan wailed.
\par "So who asked you to be comfortable?" Fultz snapped, setting aside his apparatus. "You're a soldier, not a pampered prince."
\par Deegan's raw emotions turned his words into a rant. "I wish the Duke had never accepted Shaddarn's offer to come here. He must have known it was a trap! We can never live in a place like this!" He stood up, making exaggerated, scarecrowlike gestures.

\par "We need water, the ocean," Elto said, overcoming pain to lift his voice. "Does anybody else remember rain?"
\par "I do," Deegan said, his voice a pitiful whine.
\par Elto thought of his first view of the sweeping wastelands of open desert beyond the Shield Wall. His initial impression had been nostalgic, already homesick. The undul
ating panorama of sand dunes had been so similar to the even patterns of waves on the sea ... but without any drop of water.
\par Issuing a strange cry, Deegan rushed to the nearest wall and clawed at the stone, kicking and trying to dig his way out with bare h
ands. He tore his nails and pounded with his fists, leaving bloody patterns on the unforgiving rock, until two of the other soldiers dragged him away and wrestled him to the ground. One man, a hand-to-hand combat specialist who had trained at the famous S
wordmaster School on Ginaz, ripped open one of their remaining mcdpaks and dosed Deegan with a strong sedative.
\par The pounding artillery continued. Won't they ever stop? He felt an odd, pain-wracked sensation that he might be scaled in this hellhole for etern
ity, trapped in 2 blip of time from which there was no escape. Then he heard his uncle's voice....Kneeling beside the claustrophobic gunner, Uncle Hoh leaned close, whispering, "Listen. Let me tell you a story." It was a private tale intended only for Dee
g
an's ears, though the intensity in the Jongleur's voice seemed to shimmer in the thick air. Elto caught a few words about a sleeping princess, a hidden and magical city, a lost hero from the Butlerian Jihad who would slumber in oblivion until he rose agai
n to save the Imperium. By the time Hoh Vitt completed his tale, Deegan had fallen into a stupor.
\par Elto suspected what his uncle had done, that he had disregarded the ancient prohibition against using the forbidden powers of planet Jongleur, ancestral home o
f the Vitt family. In the low light their gazes met, and Uncle Hoh's eyes were bright and fearful. As he'd been conditioned to do since childhood, Elto tried not to think about it, for he too was a Vitt.
\par Instead, he visualized the events that had occurred 
only hours before....On the streets of Arrakeen, some of the Harkormen soldiers had been fighting in an odd manner. The Atreides elite corps had shouldered lasguns to lay down suppressing fire. The buzzing weapons had filled the air with crackling power, 
contrasted with much more primal noises of screams and the percussive explosions of old-fashioned artillery fire.
\par The battle-scarred weapons master ran at the vanguard, bellowing in a strong voice that was rich and accustomed to command. "Watch yourselves-a
nd don't underestimate them." Halleck lowered his voice, growling; Elto wouldn't have heard the words if he hadn't been running close to the commander. "They're in formations like Sardaukar."
\par Elto shuddered at the thought of the Emperor's crack tenor troop
s, said to be invincible. Have the Harkonnens teamed Sardaukd methods? It was confusing.Sergeant Hoh Vitt grabbed his nephew's shoulder and turned him to join another running detachment. Everyone seemed more astonished by the unexpected and primitive mort
ar bombardment than by the strafing attacks of the assault 'thopters.
\par "Why would they use artillery, Uncle?" Elto shouted. He still hadn't fired a single shot from his lasgun. "Those weapons haven't been used effectively for centuries." Though the young rec
ruit might not be well practiced in battle maneuvers, he had at least read his military history.
\par "Harkonnen devils," Hoh Vitt said. "Always scheming, always coming up with some trick. Damn them!"One entire wing of the Arrakeen palace glowed orange, consume
d by inner flames. Elto hoped the Atreides family had gotten away... Duke Leto, Lady Jessica, young Paul. He could still see their faces, their proud but not unkind manners; he could still hear their voices.
\par As the street battle continued, blue, uniformed 
Harkormen invaders ran across an intersection, and Hallecles men roared in challenge. Impulsively, Elto fired his own weapon at the massed enemies, and the air shimmered with a crisscross web of bluewhite lines. He fumbled, firing the lasgun again.
\par Scovich
 snapped at him. "Point that damn thing away from mel You're supposed to hit Harkonnenst" Without a word, Uncle Hoh grasped Elto's rifle, placed the young man's hands in proper positions, reset the calibration, then slapped him on the back. Elto fired aga
in, and hit a blue-uniformed invader.
\par Agonized cries of injured men throbbed around him, mingled with frantic calls of medics and squad leaders. Above it an, the weapons master yelled orders and curses through twisted lips. Gurney Halleck already looked def
eated, as if he had personally betrayed his Duke. He had escaped from a Harkormen slave pit years before, had lived with smugglers on Salusa Secundus, and had sworn revenge on his enemies. Now, though, the troubadour warrior could not salvage the situatio
n.
\par Under attack, Halleck waved his hands to command the entire detachment. "Sergeant Vitt, take men into the Shield Wall tunnels and guard our supply storehouses. Secure defensive positions and lay down a suppressing fire to take out those artillery weapons
."
\par Never doubting that his orders would be obeyed, Halleck turned to the remainder of his elite corps, reassessing the strategic situation. Elto saw that the weapons master had picked his best fighters to remain with him. In his heart, Elto had known at th
at moment, as he did now thinking back on it, that if this were ever to be told as one of his uncles vivid stories, the tale would be cast as a tragedy.
\par In the heat of battle, Sergeant Hoh Vitt had shouted for them to trot double-time up the cliffside road
. His detachment had taken their weapons and left the walls of Arrakeen. Glowlamps and portable illuminators showed firefly chains of other civilian evacuees trying to find safety in the mountainous barrier.
\par Panting, refusing to slacken their pace, they ha
d gained altitude, and Elto looked down on the burning garrison city. TheHarkonnens wanted the desert planet back, and they wanted to eradicate House Atreides. The blood-feud between the two noble families dated all the way back to the Butlerian Jihad.

\par Ser
geant Vitt reached a camouflaged opening and entered his code to allow them access. Down below, the gunfire continued. An assault 'thopter swooped along the side of the mountain, sketching black streaks of slagged rock; Scovich, Fultz, and Deegan opened f
ire, but the 'thopter retreated-after marking their position.
\par As the rest of the detachment raced inside the caves, Elto took a moment at the threshold to note the nearest artillery weapons. He saw five of the huge, old-style guns pounding indiscriminately 
at Arrakeen -the Harkonnens didn't care how much damage they caused. Then two of the mighty barrels rotated to face the Shield Wall. Flames belched out, followed by far-off thunder, and explosive shells rained down upon the cave openings.
\par "Get inside!" Ser
geant Vitt shouted. ne others moved to obey, but Elto remained fixated. In a single stroke, a long line of fleeing civilians vanished from the cliffside paths, as if a cosmic artist with a giant paintbrush had decided to erase his work. The artillery guns
 continued to fire and fire, and soon centered on the position of the soldiers.
\par The range of Elto's full-power lasgun was at least as long as the conventional shells. He aimed and fired, pulsing out an unbroken stream but expecting little in the way of resu
lts. However, the dissipating heat struck the old-fashioned explosives in the loaded artillery shells, and the ragged detonation ripped out the breech of the mammoth cannon.
\par He turned around, grinning, trying to shout his triumph to his uncle -then a shell
 from the second massive gun struck squarely above the entrance to the cave. The explosion knocked Elto farther into the tunnel as tons of rock showered down, striking him. The avalanche sent shock waves through an entire section of the Shield Wall. The c
ontingent was sealed inside....
\par After days in the tomblike cave, one of the glowglobes gave out and could not be recharged; the remaining two managed only a flickering light in the main room. Elto lay wounded, tended by the junior medic and his dwindling su
pplies of medicinals. Elto's pain had dulled from that of broken glass to a cold, cold blackness that seemed easier to endure... but how he longed for a sip of water!
\par Uncle Hoh shared his concern, but was unable to do anything else.
\par Squatting on the stone floor off to his left, two sudlen soldiers had used their fingertips to trace a grid in the dust; with light and dark stones they played a makeshift game of Go, a carryover from ancient Terra.
\par Everyone waited and waited-not for rescue, but for the serenity of death, for escape.
\par The shelling outside had finally stopped. Elto knew with a sick certainty that the Atreides had lost. Gurney Halleck and his elite corps would be dead by now, the Duke and his family either killed or captured; none of the loyal Atrei
des soldiers dared to hope that Leto or Paul or Jessica had escaped.
\par The signalman Scovich paced the perimeter, peering into darkened cracks and crumbling walls. Finally, after carefully imprinting a distress message into the voice patterns of his captive 
distrans bats, he released them. The small creatures circled the dusty enclosure, seeking a way out. Their highpitched cries echoed from the porous stone as they searched for any tiny niche. After frantic flapping and swooping, at last the pair disappeare
d through a fissure in the ceiling.
\par "Well see if this works," Scovich said. His voice held little optimism.
\par In a weak but valiant voice, Elto called his uncle nearer. Using most of his remaining strength, he propped himself on an elbow. "Tell me a story, about the good times we had on our fishing trips."
\par Hoh Vitt's eyes brightened, but for only a second before fear set in. He spoke slowly. "On Caladan... Yes, the old days."
\par "Not so long ago, Uncle."
\par "Oh, but it seems like it."
\par "You're right," Elto said. He a
nd Hoh Vitt had taken a coracle along the shore, past the lush pundi rice paddies and out into open water, beyond the seaweed colonies. They had spent days anchored in the foamy breakwaters of dark coral reefs, where they dove for shells, using small kniv
es to pry free the flammable nodules called coral gems. In those magical waters they caught fan-fish - one of the great delicacies of the Imperium - and ate them raw.
\par "Caladan..." the gunner Deegan said groggily, as he emerged from his stupor. "Remember how vast the ocean was? It seemed to cover the whole world."
\par Hoh Vitt had always been so good at telling stories, supernaturally good. He could make the most outrageous things real for his listeners. Friends or family made a game of throwing an idea at Hoh, a
nd he would make up a story using it. Blood mixed with melange ... a great Heighliner race across uncharted foldspace ... the wrist-wrestling championship of the universe, between two dwarf sisters who were the finalists ... a talking slig."No, no more st
ories, Elto," the sergeant said in a fearful voice. "Rest now."
\par "You're a Master Jongleur, aren't you? You always said so."
\par "I don't talk about that much." Hoh Vitt turned away.
\par His ancestral family had once been proud members of an ancient school of storyt
elling on the planet Jongleur. Men and women from that world used to be the primary troubadours of the Imperium; they traveled between royal houses, telling stories and singing songs to entertain the great families. But House Jongleur fell into disgrace w
hen a number of the itinerant storytellers were proven to be double agents in inter-House feuds, and no one trusted them any longer. When the nobles dropped their servi
ces, House Jongleur forfeited its status in the Landsraad, losing its fortunes. Guild Hei
ghliners stopped going to their planet; the buildings and infrastructure, once highly advanced, fell into disrepair. Largely due to the Jongleur's demise, many entertainment innovations were developed, including holo-pr
ojections, filmbooks and shigawire recorders.
\par "Now is the time, Uncle. Take me back to Caladan. I don't want to be here."
\par "I can't do that, boy," he responded in a sad voice. "We're all stuck here."
\par "Make me think I'm there, like only you can do. I don't want to die in this hellish place."
\par Wi
th a piercing squeak, the two distrans bats returned. Confused and frustrated, they fluttered around the chamber while Scovich tried to recapture them. Even they had been unable to escape....Though the trapped men had held out little hope, the failure of 
the bats still made them groan in dismay. Uncle Hoh looked at them, then down to Elto as his expression hardened into grim determination.
\par "Quiet! All of you." He knelt beside his injured nephew. Hoh's eyes became glazed with tears ... or something more. "The boy needs to hear what I have to say."
\par Elto lay back, letting his eyes fall half-closed as he readied himself for the words that would paint memory pictures on the insides ofhis eyelids. Sergeant Vitt sat rigid, taking deep breaths to compose himself, to
 center his uncanny skill and stoke the fires of imagination. To tell the type of story these men needed, a Master Jongleur must calm himself-, he moved his hands and fingers in the ancient way, going through the motions he'd been taught by generations of
 storytellers, ritualistic preparations to make the story good and Pure.
\par Fultz and Scovich shifted uneasily, and then moved closer, anxious to listen as well. Hoh Vitt looked at them with glazed eyes, barely seeing them, but his voice carried a gruff warnin
g. "There is danger.""Danger?" Fultz laughed and raised his grimy hands to the dim ceiling and surrounding rock walls. "Tell us something we don't know."
\par "Very well." Hoh was deeply saddened, wishing he hadn't pulled strings to get Elto assigned to the pre
stigious corps. The young man still thought of himself as an outsider, but ironically - by staying in the line of fire and destroying one of the artillery weapons-he had shown more courage than any of the proven soldiers.
\par Now Hoh Vitt felt a tremendous sen
se of impending loss. This wonderful young man, filled not only with his own hopes and dreams but also with those of his parents and uncle, was going to die without ever achieving his bright promise. He looked around, at the faces of the other soldiers, a
nd seeing how they looked at him with such anticipation and admiration, he felt a moment of pride.
\par In the hinterlands of Jongleur, a hilly rural region where Hoh Vitt had grown up, dwelled a special type of storyteller. Even the natives suspected these "Mas
ter Jongleurs" of sorcery and dangerous ways. They could spin stories like deadly spiderwebs, and in order to protect their secrets, they allowed themselves to be shunned, hiding behind a cloak of mystique.
\par "Hurry, Uncle," Elto said, his voice quiet and thready.
\par With intensity in his words, Sergeant Vitt leaned closer. "You remember how my stories always start, don't you?" He touched the young man's pulse.
\par "You warn us not to believe too deeply, to always remember that it's only a story ... 0, it could be dangerous. We could lose our minds."
\par "I'm saying that again to you, boy." He scanned the closepressed faces around him. "And to everyone listening."
\par 
\par Scovich made a scoffing noise, but the others remained silent and intent. Perhaps they thought his warning was only part of the storytelling process, part of an illusion a Master Jongleur needed to create.
\par After a moment's hush, Hoh employed the enhanced memorization techniques of the Jongleurs, a method of transferring large amounts of information and retainin
g it for future genera. tions. In this manner he brought to mind the planet Caladan, summoning it in every intricate detail.
\par "I used to have a wingboat," he said with a gentle smile, and then he began to describe sailing on the seas of Caladan. He used his
 voice like a paintbrush, selecting words carefully, like pigments precisely mixed by an artist. He spoke to Elto, but his story spread hypnotically, wrapping around the circle of listeners like the wispy smoke of a fire."
\par You and your father went with me 
on week-long fishing trips. Oh, those days! Up at sunrise and casting nets until sunset, with the golden tone of the sun framing each day. I must say we enjoyed our time alone on the water even more than the fish we caught. The companionship, the adventur
es and hilarious mishaps."
\par And hidden in his words were subliminal signals: Smell the salt water, the iodine of drying seaweed ... Hear the whisper of waves, the splash of a distant fish too large to bring aboard whole."
\par At night, when we sat at anchor alon
e in the middle of the seaweed islands, we'd stay up late, the three of us, playing a fast game of tri-chess on a board made of flatpearls and abalone shells. The pieces themselves were carved from the translucent ivory tusks of South Caladan walruses. Do
 you remember?"
\par "Yes, Uncle. I remember."
\par All the men murmured their agreement; the Jongleur's haunting words were as real to them as to the young man who had actually experienced the memories.
\par Listen to the hypnotic, throbbing songs of unseen murmons hiding in a fog bank that ripples across the calm waters.
\par The shroud of pain grew fuzzy around Elto, and he could feel himself going to that other place and time, being carried away from this hellish place. The parched, dusty air at first smelled dank, then coo
l and moist. As he closed his eyes, he could sense the loving touch of Caladan breezes on his cheek. He smelled the mists of his native world, spring rain on his face, sea waves lapping at his feet as he stood on the rocky beach below the Atreides castle.
"
\par When you were young, you would splash in the water, laughing and swimming naked with your friends. Do you remember?"
\par "I..."And Elto felthisvoice merge with the others, becoming one with them. \'93We remember," the men mumbled reverently. AD around them the a
ir had grown close and stifling, most of the oxygen used up. Another one of the glowglobes died. But the men didn't know this. They were anesthetized from their pain.
\par See the wingboat cruising like a razorfin under dazzling sunlight, then through a warm squall under cloudy skies."
\par I used to body surf in the waves," Elto said with a faint smile of wonder.
\par 
\par Fultz coughed, then added his own reminiscences. "I spent a summer on a small farm overlooking the sea, where we harvested paradan melons. Have you ever had one fresh out of the water? Sweetest fruit in the universe."
\par Even Deegan, still somewhat dazed, leaned forward. "I saw an clecran once, late at night and far away - oh, they're rare, but they do exist. It's more than just a sailor's story. Looked like a
n electrical storm on the water, but alive. Luckily, the monster never came close." Though the gunner had been hysterical not long before, his words held such an awed solemnity that no one thought to disbelieve him.
\par Swim through the water, feel its caress 
on your body. Imagine being totally wet, immersed in the sea. The waves surround you, holding and protecting you like a mother's arms....The two distrans bats, still loose from the signalmans cages, had clung to the ceiling for hours, but now they swayed 
and dropped to the floor. All the air was disappearing in their tomb.
\par Elto remembered the old days in Cala City, the stories his uncle used to tell to an entranced audience of his family. At several points in each of those tales, Uncle Hoh would force himse
lf to break away. He had always taken great care to remind his listeners that it was only a story.This time, however, Hoh Vitt took no breaks.
\par Realizing this, Elto felt a moment of fear, like a dreamer unable to awaken from a nightmare. But then he allowed
 himself to succumb. Though he could barely breathe, he forced himself to say, "I'm going into the water ... I'm diving ... I'm going deeper . . ."Then all the trapped soldiers could hear the waves, smell the water, and remember the whisper of Caladan sea
s....The whisper became a roar.

In the velvet shadows of a crisp night on Dune, Fremen scavengers dropped over the ridge of the Shield Wall, into the rubble. Stillsuits softened their silhouettes, allowing them to vanish like beetles into crevices. Below, 
most of the fires in Arrakeen had been put out, but the damage remained untended. The new Harkormen rulers had returned to their traditional seat of government in Carthag; they would leave the scarred Atreides city as a blackened wound for a few months ..
. as a reminder to the people. 
The feud between House Atreides and House Harkormen meant nothing to the Fremen -the noble families were all unwelcome interlopers on their sacred desert planet, which the Fremen had claimed as their own thousands of years ear
lier, after the Wandering. For millennia these people had carried the wisdom of their ancestors, including an ancient Terran saying about each cloud having a silver lining. The Fremen would use the bloodshed of these royal houses to their own advantage: t
he deathstills back at the sietch would drink deeply from the casualties of war. 
Harkormen patrols swept the area, but the soldiers cared little for the bands of furtive Fremen, pursuing and killing them only out of sport rather than in a focused program of
 genocide. The Harkormens paid no heed to the Atreides trapped in the Shield Wall either, thinking none of them could have survived; so they left the bodies trapped in the rubble. From the Fremen perspective, the Harkormens did not value their resources. 
Working together, using bare callused hands and metal digging tools, the scavengers began their excavation, opening a narrow tunnel between the rocks. Only a few dim glowglobes hovered close to the diggers, providing faint light. 
Through soundings and caref
ul observations on the night of the attack, the Fremen knew where the victims would be. They had uncovered a dozen already, as well as a precious cache of supplies, but now they were after something much more valuable, the tomb of an entire detachment of 
A
treides soldiers. The desert men toiled for hours, sweating into the absorbent layers of their stillsuits, taking only a few sipped drops of recovered moisture. Many water rings would be earned for the moisture recovered from these corpses, making these F
remen scavengers wealthy. 
When they broke into the cave enclosure, though, they stepped into a clammy stone coffin filled with the redolence of death. Some of the Fremen cried out or muttered superstitious prayers to Shai-Hulud, but others probed forward, i
ncreasing the light from the glowglobes now that they were out of sight of the nighttime patrols. 
The Atreides soldiers all lay dead together, as if struck down in a strange suicide ceremony. One man sat in the center of their group, and when the Fremen le
ader moved him, his body fell to one side and a gush of water spewed out of his mouth. The Fremen tasted it. Salt water. The scavengers backed away, even more frightened no 
Carefully, two young men inspected the bodies, finding that the uniforms of the Atr
eides were warm and wet, stinking of mildew and damp rot. Their dead eyes were open wide and staring, but with contentment instead of the expected horror, as if they had shared a religious experience. All of the dead Atreides soldiers had clammy skin ... 
and something even more peculiar, revealed when the Fremen cut them open. The lungs of these dead men were entirely filled with water. 
The Fremen fled, leaving their spoils behind, and resealed the cave. Thereafter, it became a forbidden place of legend, drawing wonder from anyone hearing the story as it was passed on by Fremen from generation to generation. 
Somehow, sealed inside a lightless cave in the driest desert, all of the Atreides soldiers had drowned...}{\f44\fs28\lang1033\langfe1049\langnp1033\insrsid10639609\charrsid10639609
