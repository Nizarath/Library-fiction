\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      It was an ordinary gray British Ford, the spartan economy model with right-hand drive customary in Ireland. John Roe O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Neill would remember the driver\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s brown-sweatered right arm resting on the car\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s windo\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
wsill in the cloud-filtered light of that Dublin afternoon. A nightmare capsule of memory, it excluded everything else in the scene; just the car and that arm.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Several other surviving witnesses commented on a crumpled break in the Ford\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s left front wi\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ng. The break had begun to rust.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      Speaking from her hospital bed, one witness said: \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 The break was a jagged thing and I was afraid someone would be cut if they brushed against it.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Two of those who recalled seeing the car come out of Lower Leeson \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
Street knew the driver casually, but only from his days in postal uniform. He was Francis Bley, a retired postman working part-time as a watchman at a building site in Dun Laoghaire. Bley left for work early every Wednesday, giving himself time to run a f
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 w errands and then pick up his wife, Tessie. On that one day each week, Tessie spent the morning doing \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 light secretarial\'94\loch\f0 
 for a betting shop in King Street. It was Tessie\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s habit to spend the rest of the day with her widowed sister who lived in a remodel\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
d gatehouse off the Dun Laoghaire bypass \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 just a few minutes out of his way.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      This was a Wednesday. May 20. Bley was on his way to pick up Tessie.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The Ford\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s left front door, although appearing undamaged by the accident that had crumpled the wing\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
, still required a twist of wire around the doorpost to keep it closed. The door rattled every time the car hit a bump.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 I heard it rattling when it turned onto St. Stephen\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s Green South,\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  one witness said. \'93\loch\f0 It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s God\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 s own mercy I wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 t at the Grafton corner when it happened.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Bley turned right off St. Stephen\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Green South, which put him on St. Stephen\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s Green West, hugging the left lane as he headed for Grafton Street. There were better routes for him to make his connection with \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Tessie, but this was \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 his way.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 He liked to see all the people,\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  Tessie said. \'93\loch\f0 God rest him, that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s what he said he missed most when he quit the postal \hich\f0 
\endash \loch\f0 \hich\f0  all the people.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Bley, slight and wrinkled, had that skin-stretched cadaverous look that is\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 common among certain aged Celts from the south of Ireland. He wore a soiled brown hat almost the exact shade of his patched sweater, and he drove with the patient detachment of someone who came this way often. And if the truth were known, he rather liked
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 being slowed by the heavy traffic.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      It had been cold and wet through most of spring and, while it was still cloudy, the cloud cover had thinned and there was a feeling that there might be a break in the weather. Only a few of the pedestrians carried um
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 brellas. The trees of St. Stephen\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Green on Bley\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s right were in full leaf.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      As the Ford inched along in the congested traffic, the man watching for it from a fourth-floor window of the Irish Film Society Building nodded once in satisfaction.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Rig\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ht on time.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Bley\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s Ford had been selected because of this Wednesday punctuality. There was also the fact that Bley did not garage his car where he and Tessie lived in Davitt Road. The Ford was parked outside beside a thick yew hedge, which could be ap
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 proached from the street along a path shielded by a parked van. There had been a van parked in this covering position the previous night. Neighbors had seen it but no one had thought to comment at the time.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 There were often vehicles parked in that pl\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ace,\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  one said. \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 How were we to know?\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The watcher at the Film Society Building had many names but he had been born Joseph Leo Herity. He was a small, solidly fleshy man with a long, thin face and pale, almost translucent skin. Herity wore his blond h
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 air combed straight back and hanging almost to the collar. His light brown eyes were deeply set and he had a pugged nose with prominent nostrils from which hair protruded.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      From his fourth-floor vantage, Herity commanded an overview of the entire setti\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ng for the drama he was about to ignite. Directly across from him, the tall trees of the green formed a verdant wall enclosing the flow of vehicles and pedestrians. The Robert Emmet statue stood opposite his window and, to the left of it, there was a blac
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 -on-white sign to the public toilets. Bley\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Ford had stopped with the traffic just to the left of Herity\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s window. A white tour bus with blue-and-red stripes down its side loomed over the small Ford. Traffic fumes were thick even at the fourth-floor leve\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 .
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Herity checked Bley\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s license number to be certain. Yes \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  JIA-5028. Then there was the crumpled left front wing.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The traffic began to inch forward, then stopped once more.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Herity glanced left at the Grafton Street corner. He could see the \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
signs of the Toy World shop and the Irish Permanent Society on the ground floor of the red brick building soon to be taken over by the Ulster Bank. There had been some protest about that, one ragged march with a few signs, but it had died out quickly. The
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Ulster Bank had powerful friends in the government.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Barney and his lot, Herity thought. They think we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re ignorant of their scheme to make a peace with the Ulster boys!
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Again, Bley\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Ford inched toward the corner, but once more was stopped. There \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 was heavy foot traffic where Grafton took off from St. Stephen\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s Green.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      A bald-headed man in a dark blue suit had stopped almost directly beneath Herity\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s window and was examining the cinema marquee. Two young men pushing bicycles threaded their way p
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ast the bald-headed man.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The traffic remained stopped.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Herity looked down at the top of Bley\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s car. So innocent-looking, that car. Herity had been one of the two-man team to emerge from the yew-shrouded van near Bley\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s parking spot the previous n\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ight. In Herity\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hands had been a molded plastic package, which they had attached like a deformed limpet under Bley\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s car. At the core of that package lay a tiny radio receiver. The transmitter sat on the windowsill in front of Herity. A small black meta\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 rectangle, it had a thin wire antenna and two recessed toggle switches \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  one painted yellow, the other red. Yellow armed it, red transmitted.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      A glance at his wristwatch told Herity that they were already five minutes past Zero Time. Not Bley\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s fault.\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  It was the blasted traffic.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 You can set your bloody watch by Bley,\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  the leader of their selection team had said. \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 The old bastard should be running a tram.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 What\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 re his politics?\'94\loch\f0  Greaves had asked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Who cares about his politics?\'94\loch\f0  Herity \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 had countered. \'93\loch\f0 He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s perfect and he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 The street\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 ll be full of people,\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  Greaves had said. \'93\loch\f0 And there\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0

They know what to expect when they don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t listen to us.\'94

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The pattern of change built itself slowly in John Roe O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Neill. It set him trembling unexpectedly at odd moments, his heart pounding, sweat brea\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
king out all over his body. At such times, he thought of the old beliefs in possession. It was like that \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  another personality taking over his flesh and nerves.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Much later, he came to a personal accommodation with this Other, even a sense of familiari\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ty and identity. He thought of it then as partly his own making, partly a thing rising out of primal darkness, a deliberate creation for the task of revenge. Certainly, his Old Self had not been up to such a deed. The kindly teacher-of-the-young could not
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 have contemplated such a plan for an instant. The Other had to come into being first.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      As the change progressed, he came to think of himself as Nemesis revived. This Nemesis came out of Ireland\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s bloody past, out of the betrayals and murders, and even \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
carried with it a retaliation against the Celtic extermination of the First People, the Danaans, who had been in Ireland before the waves of invaders from Britain and the Continent. He saw himself then as a spokesman for all of the accumulated wrongs suff
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 red in Ireland. It was Nemesis blaring:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Enough! Let it end!\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      But the Other asked: \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Why should Ireland shoulder it all alone?\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The terrorists who had killed Mary and the twins had been trained and armed in Libya. And there was England\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s filt\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 hy hand in the whole mess \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 
 eight hundred years of cynical oppression \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 \hich\f0  \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Ireland, the guilty conscience of the English ruling class.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      As this change became fixed in its purpose, John saw an astonishing alteration of his appearance. The old almost plum\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
p self went stringing down to a slender, nervous man, who avoided old friends, refused to answer the telephone and ignored appointments. People made allowances at first \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 \hich\f0  \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
The awful shock of such a tragedy\'85\'94\loch\f0  The foundation that had sent him to Ireland gav\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 him an unrequested extension on the project with a polite letter asking if he wanted to turn it over to another researcher. The school extended his leave of absence. Max Dunn, who managed the family pharmacy, took over more of the business decisions and 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 old John not to concern himself with anything except getting his life back in order.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John merely noted these things in passing. The change within him had become an obsession. Then he looked at himself in the bathroom mirror one Saturday morning and kn\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ew he would have to take action. Mary and the twins had been dead and buried four months. The Other was strong in him now; a new face, a new personality. He stood in the upstairs bathroom of the home he and Mary had bought when they had first learned of h
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 r pregnancy. The sounds of the old college town drifted up to him through the open window. There was a feeling of fall in the air but the forecast was for another two weeks of \'93\loch\f0 
\hich\f0 warmer than normal\'94\loch\f0  weather. John could hear Mister Neri down the street runni\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
g his power mower. A bicycle bell went jingling past. Children shouted on their way to the park. It was September already; he knew that. And he remembered how Kevin and Mairead had shouted at play in the yard.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Neri shut down his mower. Mrs. Neri had b\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 een one of the most persistent callers. \'93\loch\f0 You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 re wasting away to skin and bones, you poor man!\'94
\loch\f0  But Mrs. Neri had a younger sister, unmarried and getting anxious. There had been a matchmaker\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s look in Mrs. Neri\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s plump face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John leaned close to the mi\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 rror and looked at himself carefully. The changes\'85\loch\f0  not quite a stranger, but strange. }{\i\dbch\af11\insrsid3359690 \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
They won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t have any photographs of this face}{\dbch\af11\insrsid3359690 \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 , he thought. }{\i\dbch\af11\insrsid3359690 \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 But they would make drawings and spread them far and wide}
{\dbch\af11\insrsid3359690 \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 . At that moment, the thought still in his mind, he kne\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 w he was going to do this thing, knew he was capable of it and would certainly do it. That scream at St. Stephen
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Green had set something in motion, like the slow beginning of an avalanche. }{\i\dbch\af11\insrsid3359690 \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Let it come then}{\dbch\af11\insrsid3359690 \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 , he thought.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      That morning, he put his house\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0  on the market and, because properties near the college were much in demand, he had it sold two weeks later to a \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
nice young assistant professor,\'94\loch\f0  as the Real Estate Woman called him. All of these people were like dream faces to John. His thoughts had gon\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 questing ahead to the thing that needed doing. The Nice Young Assistant Professor had wanted to know when Doctor O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Neill would be returning to his post at the school.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 We heard about your tragedy of course, and we understand why you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re selling \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  all \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 of the memories.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      He doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t understand at all, John thought.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      But the transaction put a clear $188,000 in John\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s pocket. The Real Estate Woman had tried to talk to John about his \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 tax obligations\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
 and had worked to sell him \'93\loch\f0 a much better investm\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ent a bit farther out but on land sure to increase in value dramatically over the next ten years.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      He had lied to her, saying his accountants already had the problem in hand.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The contents of the house had brought an astonishing $62,000, but then \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Mary\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s father had left her some valuable old books and two fine paintings. Her family\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 s furniture had included several antiques, a thing John had never even thought about before. Furniture had always been only something to fill the spaces in a house.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The college fund they had set aside for the twins yielded another $33,000. There was the McCarthy annuity from John\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s mother, against which the bank loaned him $56,000. Their small portfolio of stocks brought $28,900. The bank accounts over which Mary had\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
worked so hard brought $31,452. Almost $30,000 remained in the grant for the Ireland project, money he had not transferred to the Allied Irish Bank, keeping it in a high-interest brokerage fund that the foundation had approved. His salary, reduced by the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 abbatical\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s requirements, produced close to $16,000 more.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      Friends and associates had seen only the surface of this activity, taking it as \'93\loch\f0 a good sign John\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s finally getting back to normal.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The most delicate parts of the transition involved deal\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ing with the Internal Revenue Service and the sale of the pharmacy that had been in his mother\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 
s family now for two generations. Max Dunn said he understood that John might not want to publicize the sale, \'93\loch\f0 and besides I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d want to keep the McCarthy name ov\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

 none of which John ever intended to collect. The $78,000 was what he wanted. Cash!

\rquote \loch\f0 s affairs. The IRS, mindful of the sympathy for John and wary of adverse publicity, granted a si\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 x\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 -month deferral.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
     On the day he left Highland Park in his station wagon, John had almost $500,000 tucked away in the back in the fireproof box that once had held his will and property deeds. The rest of the wagon was crammed full of the carefully packe
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 d elements of his personal laboratory, including his computer. Two suitcases of clothing had to be secured under the safety belt beside him on the front seat.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      Friends accepted the story that he was going to look for \'93\loch\f0 someplace farther out, a place wit\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 hout these memories.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
     Late that evening, he ate supper almost four hundred miles away from the place he no longer called home, sitting in a roadside cafe that smelled of rancid grease. He chose a booth that gave him a view of the car parked outside, n
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
oting the gray film of dust that gave it a rundown look. That was good. The grille still showed a shallow dent Mary had put there while trying to maneuver out of a supermarket parking lot. John left without finishing the meal and could not even remember w

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Later, he found a motel with an alcove parking place beside his room. He transferred the fireproof box to a place under the bed, put his father\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s old .38 Colt under the pillow and lay down fully clothed, not expecting to sleep. He c\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

 There would be other name changes required later, he realized, but a new one was needed immediately.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      It was early afternoon and already there was color in the deciduous trees along the highway. The hills were brown and a nip could be felt in the air.\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The transition had gone much more simply than he had anticipated. There remained one more essential detail to complete it. Over the next three day\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
s, he removed the hair from his head. There had been a choice \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 
 shave or do something more permanent. He chose the latter course, not an insurmountable task for a biochemist, although it proved painful and left a fine network of pink scars, tiny veins tha\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 he knew would fade in time.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The mole on his left cheek vanished under an application of liquid nitrogen, leaving a scabbed sore that would in time become a puckered dimple.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The change fascinated him. He examined it carefully in the bathroom mirr\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
or of a Spokane motel. The flashing neon of an adjoining hamburger stand cast a baleful stroboscopic glare across the side of his face as the light flashed on the bathroom\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s drawn shade. He smiled. John Roe O\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 Neill, rather plump and with a rich matt of br\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 wn hair, a distinctive mole on his cheek, had become this bald, slender man with eyes of a burning intensity.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Hello, John Leo Patrick McCarthy,\'94\loch\f0  he whispered.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Four days later, the first Friday in October, he moved into a furnished rental house i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
n the Ballard suburb of Seattle, Washington. He had a one-year lease and only a bank with which to deal. The owners lived in Florida.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The Ballard house suited his purpose perfectly. The ease with which he had found it struck him as an omen. The owners\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 had painted it a muddy brown with white trim. It sat anonymously in a mishmash row of other houses equally anonymous. The houses had been built on a long, low embankment, some sporting rockeries, some steep lawns. Most of them possessed daylight basement
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  and garages under the main floor. John\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s garage opened into the basement with ample room to unload the power wagon.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The furniture was garage-sale jumble and the bed sagged. Old cooking smells permeated the house and persisted in the draperies. There \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
was an odor of stale tobacco in the bathroom. He flushed the toilet and caught his reflection in the mirror over the sink.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      None of his old mildness had survived. This Other was driven from within. He leaned close to the mirror and looked at the pucker\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
ing scar where he had removed the mole. In that pitted void he sensed a final break with his past, the past of Mary who had called the mole his \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 beauty spot.\'94\loch\f0 
 He tried to remember the sensation of her kiss on that place; this memory, too, had gone. The sh\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
fting of his memories, the unchecked displacements, sent a shudder through him. He turned away from the mirror quickly. There were things to do.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      In the next few days he made essential changes in the house \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  translucent film over basement and garage wi\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ndows to shield him from prying eyes, burglar alarms, a substantial stock of food. The fireproof box went into a bricked-over secret cache he built behind the furnace. Only then did he feel free to start setting up the purchase routine for the special equ
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 pment his project required.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      The thing that surprised him the most over the following weeks was the ease with which he acquired esoteric necessities. Telephone calls and money orders from anyone putting a \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Doctor\'94
\loch\f0  in front of his name appeared to be th\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e only requirement. He had everything sent to warehouse and accommodation drops, using different names, always paying cash.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      While he was busy, memories remained tame and manageable. At night in bed, though, the shifting kaleidoscope in his mind often \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 kept him awake.

 the little car, that brown elbow on the windowsill. There was Mary smiling and laughing as she hustled the twins across the street, the package clutched under her elbow. Odd, John thought, that th\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The entire incident at the Grafton Street corner assumed in time the na\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ture of a movie. It was locked in a sequence that he could call up at will \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 \hich\f0 
 the crush of people around Mary and the twins, her stopping beside that old Ford\'85\loch\f0  and always the orange explosion peppered with shards of black. He found that he could control th\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 flow of it, focus upon particular faces, mannerisms, gestures and bits of personality in that macabre companionship.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      And always the orange explosion, the sound thumping in his skull.

Neill\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s agony.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      As he grew accustomed to this play of memory, he found it could be expanded backward and forward. The punctual bomb had exploded during their fi\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John had awakened early that first morning in the city by the Black Pool. There had not been one whiff of premonition. Contrast, that was what it had been. He had begun the day with an exuberant feeling of hea

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      As one, the soldiers he had left behind looked across at Achill, the island of the eagles, which no longer were there. It was a brooding landscape in the rain, a speckling of white\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 rocks and buildings against the greens. The few roads cut gray ledges around the hills and the ocean was a deeper gray below. Slievemore and Croaghaun thrust almost into the clouds toward Achill Head\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      A small Garda patrol car pulled up outside, bringing a lull in the conversations as the word of it was spread through the bar. Denis Flynn, the local Garda, emerged from the car. Flynn, a small blond 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 man with light blue eyes and a boyish face, appeared pale and trembling. Way was made for him as he entered the bar, pressed through the crowd to the western end and climbed onto a chair.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      In the expectant silence, Flynn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s voice was a thin tenor, which\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0  broke in unexpected places. \'93\loch\f0 We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      In the sudden babble of shouted questions, Flynn raised his \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 voice to demand silence, then: \'93\loch\f0 We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll just have to be patient. Everything\hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Mulvaney, a soft giant of a man with a bald head as shiny as his polished bar, thrust his way through the crowd to stand below Flynn. Hooking a t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 humb over his shoulder, Mulvaney said: 
\'93\loch\f0 It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s my Molly sick back there and only the one doctor. I want to know what it is.\'94

Flynn, looking toward Knockmore and the village of Droega, which lay hidden beyond the hills in the hollow that protected it from the worst of the Atlantic gales. His brother, Francis, had called from there not ten minutes ago to report another death, his

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      Turning a hard stare up at Flynn, Mulvaney said: \'93\loch\f0 Your womenfolk are living safe beyond Mulrany. You can take the official view. But it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      An abrupt silence settled over the room. A small dark man with pinched features, standing at Flynn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s right, cleared his throat.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 There\hich\f0 \rquote \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 s our own boats,\'94\loch\f0  the man said.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0    \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0   His voice hoarse, Mulvaney asked: \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Are all of our womenfolk to die then? Nineteen dead since yesterday and only the women and girls. Why is that, Denis?\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 The doctors will find the answer,\'94\loch\f0  Flynn said. He jumped down off the chair, steadying himself\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The rai\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 n had turned to a light mist as he emerged from the bar. He got into his car, not looking at the angry faces peering at him from Mulvaney\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

ishboats anchored there. He could see a fast patrol boat spreading a wide bow wave as it sped down from the Bulls Mouth. It appeared to be no more than five minutes away, for which he was thankful. He parked on the concrete and took his shotgun from its r

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      But his s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 uperintendent had been adamant on the need for secrecy. \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
A great many women are sure to die, perhaps all on the island. We count on you to keep the peace until help arrives. There must be no panic, no mobs. You must be firm in keeping order.\'94

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The cottage, a remodeled farmhouse, belonged to Adrian Peard, who had graduated six years ahead of Stephen and already was recognized as an important researcher in pressure medicine and the ailments of divers. Peard, s
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
cion of a wealthy old County Cork family, had established a vacation and weekend base at the cottage on the lake, installing a large steel pressure-decompression tank in the barn behind the cottage. Stephen had been several times to the cottage, earning m

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Since their first sexual experience beside the Mallow Road, Kate had rationed them to one or two repeats a month and then only at her least fertile times. She had resisted this outing at first because it coi

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 ll not be having any bastards in our family, Stephen Browder!\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      They had arranged the outing with care. Kate ost\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ensibly was with her friend, Maggie, on a holiday in Dublin. Stephen supposedly was boating with friends near Kinsale.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Peard, who had guessed the nature of Stephen\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s involvement with Kate, had volunteered the use of his Lough Derg cottage \'93\loch\f0 when it doe\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 sn\hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      As Peard had expected, Stephen blushed \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  as much from the praise as from the conspiracy.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The car they took was a tiny green Fiat whose use Stephen had earned tutoring its owner in the niceties of kidney function, a subject that baffl\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ed the Fiat\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 
s owner until Stephen hit on the stratagem of a large drawing with signposts on pins through which the student was required to maneuver a tiny cardboard automobile labeled \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 foreign matter.\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
 It amused Stephen and Kate to call the Fiat \'93\loch\f0 foreign \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 atter\'94\loch\f0  as they drove north.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      A few minutes before noon they crossed the narrow old stone bridge into Killaloe. The castellated tower of St. Flannery\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s Cathedral stood out like a Norman sentinel against a gathering of clouds on the horizon. The sky over\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
head was blue, however, and the lake was a blue-and-emerald mirror to the surrounding hills, its surface rippled by a light wind and the passage of a quartet of swans.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      Just north of Killaloe, Stephen stopped at a roadside \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 gypsy stand\'94\loch\f0  for sandwiches,\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 chips and beer, which they ate in the meadow beside the mound where Brian Bora had raised his castle. Their picnic site looked down on Ballyvalle Ford where Patrick Sarsfield and his six hundred troopers had crossed the Shannon on the night of August 10,
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 1690, during the Siege of Limerick.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Kate, fascinated by her nation\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s history and a little awed to be \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 in this very place,\'94\loch\f0  began regaling Stephen with the story of Sarsfield\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 s ride when she found him unfamiliar with the details. Watching her color ris\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 e as she talked about that \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 wonderful, futile ride\'94\loch\f0 
 against the Williamite siege train, Stephen looked longingly at the concealing shade of the trees that hid the circular foundation of Brian Boru\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s castle, wondering if Kate might agree to walk into that 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
heltering bower with him for a time. But he could hear children shouting at the lake below the meadow, and the picnic site soon was buzzing with flies attracted by the food. They wolfed their food and ran back to the car, pursued by the flies.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      In the \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 shelter of the car, Kate looked back at the meadow and surprised Stephen with a mystical side of her nature that he had not suspected.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 Terrible things were done in that place, Stephen. I can feel it. Could the flies be the souls of the evil men who d\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 id those terrible things?\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Ahhh, now, Kate! What a thing to say.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      She did not really cheer up until they turned down the graveled track to the cottage and she saw the old double chimney pot above the trees. When they entered the cottage, she was\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 almost childlike in her admiration.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Stephen, who had come to understand and enjoy most of her moods, took a positive delight in showing her around. The kitchen had been remodeled from its old farmhouse days, a large window added on the lakeside, ever
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 y piece of equipment not only modern but the best available.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      Kate put her hands to her cheeks as she looked at it. \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Oh, Stephen, if only we can have a house like this.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 We will, someday, Kate.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      She turned and hugged him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Outside, there\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 was a small orchard and an area set off by stones for a kitchen garden. The barn stood on the far side of the orchard. It was a stone building with a new corrugated metal roof, and was easily half again as big as the house. A tall growth of weeds lapped 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 gainst the stone sides of the barn but the path from the house through the orchard to a small side door was clear and neatly trimmed at the borders.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Stephen unlocked the padlock and swung the door open for Kate. He flipped the light switch beside the \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
door as she stepped through. Brilliant illumination flooded the one large room, pouring down from banks of reflectors suspended from the rafters by pipes. The big tank dominated the center of the area. It was a full six meters long, two and a quarter mete
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s in diameter. There were two quartz windows on each side, small and set at eye level, plus another even smaller quartz window in the pressure-sealed airlock hatch at the near end.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Kate, who had heard Stephen\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s descriptions of his stays in the tank, s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 aid: \'93\loch\f0 It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s comfortable enough,\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  he said. \'93\loch\f0 There\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s a double-seal sanitary exhaust system. It has a telephone. The only uncomfortable part was wearing all the connections for Peard to monitor\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0  my vital signs.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
     Stephen led Kate around to the far side, showing her the long bench of instruments there, the leads into the tank and, at the end, the racks and shelves of scuba gear that they used in the lough, and then at the far end, the two Fren
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ch-made compressors with their elaborate air filters.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      Kate peered through one of the quartz windows into the tank. \'93\loch\f0 I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 d be bored silly in there all that time,\'94\loch\f0  she said.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 I took some of my books. Really, Kate, it was quite peaceful. I studied and\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0  slept most of the time.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      Kate pushed herself away from the cold metal and brushed her hands against her skirt. \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 I want to make us a fine dinner in that kitchen,\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  she said. \'93\loch\f0 I\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 ve never seen such a grand kitchen. Did you get all the things on my list?\'94

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      While Kate busied herself in the kitchen, Stephen brought in their suitcases, the separate packs of their books from school and Peard\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s blood-saturation tables. He left the suitcases on the bed, made sure Kate did not need\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 anything more from the store at the village, then set himself up to study in the tiny parlor. He could hear Kate humming as she worked, the clatter of pans. It was possible to imagine the two of them safely married, a calm domesticity about their lives. 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 T\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
he mood stayed with him all through dinner and right up to the instant in bed when he showed Kate how he intended to be careful. He held up a condom that one of his fellow students had bought in England.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Kate, her face flushed, grabbed it out of his h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 and and hurled it across the room.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 Stephen! It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s sin enough what we do, but I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 ll not have that on my soul!\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      It took him almost an hour to calm her, but then she was especially tender, crying against his shoulder and laughing. They went to sleep \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 with her head cradled against his chest.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Stephen awoke late to the sound of Kate again busy in the kitchen. He had not expected this domestic side of her nature and it filled him with a warm satisfaction. She had the wireless on and was humming along 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 with the music. Stephen looked at his watch on the bedstand, shocked to find it almost 11:00 A.M., vaguely aware that the music from the wireless had stopped and a man\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s voice was speaking with controlled excitement.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      When he had bathed, dressed and en\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 tered the kitchen, he asked: \'93\loch\f0 What was that news broadcast? I couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t make it out.\'94

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      She blushed. Stephen started to turn her around, but the ringing of the telephone interrupted.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      He was a time finding the telephone behind a stack of magazines on a stand\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  in the parlor. It was Peard.

Beckett was a sandy-haired descendant of Scots-English religious refugees. He had the pink skin and pale eyes to go with this ancestry, but features that a college date had described as \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 latent course.\'94\loch\f0 
 Beckett had been a college football linebacker until\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 discovering that the constant jarring collisions of football might scramble his proudest possession \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Within minutes of meeting Francois Danzas of the French contingent, Beckett had known it would be difficult working with the Frenchman. Danzas was a tall, slender and dark native of Peronne w\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ith traces of Celt, Roman, Greek and Viking in his genes. His obviously dyed hair was swept back in two raven\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

price, now glaring, now withdrawn beneath their heavy black brows. Whenever Danzas closed his eyes, his face emptied, leaving only that long nose and a narrow, almost lipless mouth. Even the dark brows seemed to fade. As the Brittany expression had it, Da
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
zas was as tough as an old saddle. Seasoned by much use, weathered and shaped, he was now a visible repository of valuable experiences. Danzas relied on Danzas. He knew himself in jeopardy only when traveling or when eating foreign food. Foreigners, espec
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ally the English and, by language association, the Americans, were to be distrusted as fundamentally unsound, capable of evil and would cooperate only under duress. The White Plague, for Danzas, merely represented the present duress. In spite of the fact 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
hat he looked down his long Gallic nose at Americans, Danzas was recognized in his homeland as an expert on all things Yankee. Had he not endured four interminable years on an exchange-research program in Chicago? Where better to learn Yankee ways than in
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 the Hog Capital of the world?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Danzas could understand the capriciousness of life where this touched on his living arrangements, but not in his laboratory. In the lab, Danzas always expected to be eyewitness to the virgin birth if not the immaculate co
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
nception. Certain responsibilities fell upon such an eyewitness. Two observers of the event could not come up with two different stories. Thirty eyewitnesses must produce the same account. It was an infallible rule. A pope could rely on no better.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  joke in France was that Danzas had been put on The Team as contrast to his French companion, Jost Hupp. Hupp\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s horn-rimmed glasses, the slightly bulging eyes, the youthful insouciance of his features, all conspired to a totality that invited sharing. Tho\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
e who called Hupp a romantic failed to focus on the underlying strength of his fantasy world. He used romance as Beckett used a concealed anger. Where Beckett\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s muse led him to a raging intellectual striving, Hupp\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 s muse was endearing and promoted a grega\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ious sharing of everything \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 \hich\f0  successes, failures, joys, griefs\'85\loch\f0 
 everything. Threaded through this complex personality was an Alsatian tenacity compounded of both French and German ancestors. It was in part a hangover from early influence by the Roman Cath\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
lic Church. Mephistopheles was real. God was real. The White Knight was real. The grail remained the eternal goal.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      There was a pattern in this deeply satisfying to Hupp. Without it, he would have been merely a researcher, a man in a white coat, not wh\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ite armor.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
     Beckett thought Hupp was okay. A little weird but okay. Danzas, however, was a scientific prig of the worst sort. What the hell difference did it make where this team assembled just so long as the facilities were acceptable? It angered Beck
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ett that he would have to work with this prig for God alone knew how long. He kept the anger sufficiently under wraps that only Hupp suspected.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Many people had worked with Beckett for years without realizing that he operated on regular anger fixes. He\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 could find something to anger him almost anywhere and, thus charged up, went headlong into the problem confronting him. The White Plague was made to order for Beckett. That son-of-a-bitch! That fucked-up Madman! What right had he to disrupt a world that,
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 admittedly not perfect, was stumbling along in its usual fashion?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Little of this anger escaped an amiable mask. He seldom spoke harshly. If anything, he was even more amiable with Danzas, which brought out the Frenchman\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s most correct and stiffly prop
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 er courtesy. It was a matter of mutual fury that amused Hupp.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The other member of the U.S. contingent, Hupp observed, was the real surprise package, especially to the two from the Soviet Union, Sergei Alexandrovich Lepikov and Dorena Godelinsky. They \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
kept looking speculatively at Beckett\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s companion, Ariane Foss.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      At six feet six inches and 288 pounds, Foss was easily the largest person present. The French dossier on Foss judged her one of the five or six best medical heads in the United States on \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
\hich\f0 what her country-doctor grandfather had called \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 female complaints.\'94\loch\f0  Both the French and the Soviets suspected she was with the Central Intelligence Agency. It was noted that she spoke five languages fluently 
\hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  including French and Russian.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Foss had ra\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ther small but even features framed in golden hair kept trimmed to tight, natural curls. Although large, her body was well balanced.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      At the moment, Lepikov and Danzas were verbally sparring for dominance, a matter of revealing credentials as though th\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ey were card players turning up their cards, each aware that the other reserved powerful aces.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Lepikov, short and stocky with bushy gray hair over a flat face with a touch of Mongol in the eyes, appeared the peasant to Danzas\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s aristocrat, a fact that\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 each noted, thinking it a personal advantage.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Dorena Godelinsky, the other member of the Soviet contingent, showed increasing signs of irritation at the male contest. A slight, graying woman who walked with a limp, she had been cursed, as she often c

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      Abruptly, she interrupted the two men with a coarse Russian curse, adding in English: \'93\loch\f0 We are not\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  here to play little boys\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0  games!\'94

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      Foss chuckled and translated the curse: \'93\loch\f0 She just called Sergei a country stud. What do we have here \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 \hich\f0  black hat and white hat?\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Lepikov scowled at Foss, then forced a smile. He had done the mandatory tour as an\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  observer at the Soviet embassy in Washington, D.C., and understood Foss\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s jibe.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Foss grinned back at him. The United States dossier on Lepiko\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Godelinsky, hearing the boas\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 t, muttered: \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Peasant!\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      She spoke in English, which brought the attention of the others to her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Beckett cleared his throat and hitched himself closer to the table. Godelinsky, the dossier said, was a renowned code breaker in the Soviet Union as w\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ell as being a medical researcher in her country\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s space program. She was considered a top-ranked diagnostician and her laboratory techniques were rated \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 superb.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 We have been introduced,\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  Beckett said. \'93\loch\f0 We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve all read the secret service dossiers on \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 I would like to see your dossier on me,\'94\loch\f0  Lepikov said.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Godelinsky nodded. Beckett had taken exactly the right tack with Sergei. Spies were everywhere. Admit it and go on. Beckett had intuition, then. Godelinsky knew this was her own strength. She knew her Soviet colleagues 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 considered her unpredictable, but did not understand this. The reasons for her decisions always seemed perfectly clear to her. It was the intermediate steps that the \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 mud heads\'94\loch\f0 
 around her failed to understand because their minds could not leap, plodding \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 nstead like aged workhorses.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Lepikov shifted his gaze to Foss\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s large, well-formed breasts. Such a body! He nurtured a secret yen for large women and wondered if\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  perhaps\'85

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Without any particular pride, John thought his lab in the basement of the Ballard house a marvel of ingenuity. The centrifuge that he had improvised out \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
of tire-balancing equipment had cost less than a thousand dollars. His freezer was stock home bar equipment turned on its back and with a calibrated thermostat added. It was accurate to within one degree Centigrade. He had improvised peristaltic pumps fro
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 scuba equipment. His cell disrupter was adapted from a used yachting sonar. The electron microscope, a dual-stage thirty Angstrom resolution ISI model, cost him the most time and considerable money. It was provided as a consignment-theft item by the San 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 F\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 rancisco underworld at a cost of twenty-five thousand dollars.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      And so it went with the entire lab. He fashioned the negative-pressure research rooms out of plywood and plastic film. The airlock was sealed by two small boat hatches, which forced him to\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 crawl into and out of the rooms. It was the only major inconvenience.
\par 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Before the lab was completed, John was at work with his computer, setting up the full-color graphics of the molecular models upon which he would center his attention. In parallel \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
computer storage circuits, he filed away everything he could ferret out about the ways existing drugs functioned in the body. He paid particular attention to known data on enzymes and specific DNA receptors.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      It gratified him to discover that many of t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 he most important requirements for his molecular maps were available in \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 canned\'94\loch\f0  form \hich\f0 \endash 
\loch\f0  on computer discs or in storage programs that could be bought or stolen. By the time the lab was completed he had his computer loaded with the elemental building block\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  of his project.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
     There was a hypnotic fascination in sitting before the cathode display, watching the double spirals of the primal helix turn and twist at his command. The red, green, purple and yellow lines took on a life of their own. His mind and t
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
he display fell into a kind of unified space within which it was difficult to separate which was in his mind and which in the screen. It seemed at times as if his hands on the computer controls created the images in his head, or the image would be in his 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ead and then appear as if miraculously on the screen. There were moments when he thought he was actually speaking in the language of the genetic code, talking to specific sites on DNA molecules.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      During these periods, the actual flow of time vanished f\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
rom his consciousness. On one occasion, he crawled from the airlock hatch, staggered to his feet and found it just dawn outside. Investigation revealed that he had been working steadily for thirty-seven hours with only an occasional sip of water. He was a
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 hingly hungry and his trembling hands could not even deal with solid food until he drank almost a full quart of milk.

utputs of his lab. He knew it was only a matter of time until he fitted the proper molecular key into the biological lock. The answers were here in the lab and in his head. They merely had to be opened out into their own reality. The nucleotide sequences 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 f the DNA encoded all of the genetic information for every biological function. It was a code-breaking problem.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Without the computer he would have been lost. At any given moment he might be working with four thousand to twenty thousand genes. The mapp\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ed arrangements of these genes and the DNA codes within them could project into more than a million genes. He did not need all of those genes, though \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  only the key ones whose coding lay in the particular nucleotide sequences.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      By disruption, by enzyme\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  fractionating and temperature-controlled separation with collimators and centrifuge, he sought out the bits and pieces that his mind/computer images told him were there.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Before long, he was fashioning ribosomal RNAs and messenger RNAs from his own DN\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
A templates, selecting and discarding, seeking out the control sites in the genomes. These and the regulatory proteins were his first targets.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Some two months into the project, John realized he would need a special supply of natural DNA for the polyme\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
rization cycle. The DNA had to be biologically active and it had to carry the templates he required. There was no escaping the fact that the DNA material transferred in pairs, one of each pair being a mirror of its opposite number.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      His head ached with\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0  thinking about the problem, but he could not avoid the immediate necessity. It would risk exposure. It was dangerous\'85\loch\f0  but he could see no alternative.

e concrete wall. There was a single straight chair and a desk but the wall beside the desk carried a document safe whose combination was known only to Security and Beckett. His first task each night was to examine the safe and check whatever new material

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 es determined at a higher level? He thought that probable. The top document carried the presidential seal. The covering page had two red-bordered \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 overnight transmittal\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      He read the enclosures carefully, more and more puzzled as he went. First was a verbatim transcript \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
of a radio broadcast received at a military listening post, purportedly from someone in Ireland identifying himself as \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Brann McCrae.\'94\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      At the bottom of the transcript\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s last page was an unsigned scribble that Beckett thought might be the writing of the President himself. It read:

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Danzas was a man born, not out of his time, but out of place. By rights he should have been born in northern New Hampshire or in Maine. He was a Down Easter in\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  French disguise \hich\f0 \endash

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Two weeks before the Achill demonstration, John was ready to\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 leave his Ballard hideaway. He knew he would have to cover his tracks carefully. The search would be massive and international. The very size of the search meant they probably would find his place quickly. The pressures on anyone who had any contact with
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 him, even his instructor in forgery in St. Louis, I guaranteed that no secrets would be kept for long. There were no illusions in his mind about governments obeying his orders not to seek him out.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The new passport was made with extreme care. He made i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t from Mary\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s passport, taking the document from her passport case, which contained John O\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 Neill\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s passport and the separate ones for the twins. Why he chose Mary\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s passport he could not say, but he carefully hid the unused passports in the lining of his \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 uitcase.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      As he worked on the forgery, he remembered Mary saying that it would make the twins feel important to have their own passports.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The memories were oddly displaced. He felt like an eavesdropper, someone peering into the secret joys of a fe\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
llow human, prying without permission into private matters. But he could remember the twins\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  delight, comparing their pictures, showing off their ability to read and write, signing their own names importantly on the proper lines.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      When he had completed\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  the chemical erasure of Mary\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s passport, he felt that he had removed her even more from the world of the living. He went to the secret compartment in the suitcase and looked at the three blue-bound booklets with their golden embossing. The passports were\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 real. But how much of the real person was contained in them? If he erased all of them, did that actually make the people unreal? He peered closely at the coded perforations on Mary\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s passport. The laughter and happiness at the arrival of the passports wer\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 part of that movie playing in his skull. He could see Mary handing a passport to each of the children, Kevin first and then Mairead.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 They\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 re individuals and now they have the documents to prove it,\'94\loch\f0  she said.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      He restored t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
he three unused passports to their hiding place and returned to the forgery. He felt feverish and wondered if he had picked up something from his work down in the laboratory. No. He had been very careful about his own body. That was part of his total purp
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 se.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
     It was as though only this purpose kept him alive. All else receded into projections and the strange movie-memory. It was only the urgency making him feverish. He could feel time pressing at him. The fateful letters were almost ready to be mailed.
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  He turned on the lights in the narrow stairway off the kitchen and took Mary\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s erased passport down to the lab. The stairs creaked as he descended and he wondered what time it was. Dark outside. No matter. There was a spiderweb within the exposed studs w\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      How many times have I come this way?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      He felt that he had always lived here, had always known the creaking stairs. This was the only place where John McCarthy had ever lived, and the basement laboratory restored his sense of\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 being. It had become a basic part of his life \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 
 the white-painted bench with its three gas burners, the homemade centrifuge in the corner, the autoclave built out of a pressure-cooker, the oven with its precision thermostat for the controlled environment\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ,
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0  the electron microscope, the petri dishes stored sterile in Tupperware boxes\'85\loch\f0  He could hear the paint-compressor pump cutting in to prime the vacuum system, which was mediated by the scuba pump.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Carefully, he bent to the forgery, delicate movements, \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
precision in each tiny action. The master forger had been right. He was good at this. And there it was, a new identity. Only the ache in his back told him there had been a significant passage of time. He looked at his wrist, remembering that he had left h
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s watch beside the kitchen sink. It didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t matter. The feverish sense of urgency had gone.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John Garrett O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Day had just been born. There he was on the forged passport \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  a bald man with a toothbrush mustache, dark eyes that stared directly out of the sq

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John stared back at his new self. John Garrett O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Day. He already felt like John Garrett O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Day. There had been O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Days on the O\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 Neill side of the family. And there he was in the photograph. John felt that he had receded farther back int\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o the ancestry, farther away from John Roe O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
Neill, cutting that man off even more sharply.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      There would be searchers after O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Neill, and perhaps even more searchers after what John McCarthy had done. But those men were gone. O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Neill and McCarthy. Only 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Day remained and soon O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Day would be far away.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      A hunger pang struck him. He turned to the airlock, crawling out and sealing the lab behind him. It was daylight outside. His watch on the drainboard showed 9:36 and he knew it must be morning. It had b

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Time to leave.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      He felt something strange about the house then. Was there something he had forgotten to do downstairs\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
? He strapped on his wristband and hurried back down to the lab, crawled through the airlock hatches, leaving them open. No need for lab security anymore. John McCarthy\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s meticulous habits could be abandoned.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      As he stood up in the first safe room, his\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 gaze fell on the side bench and the kitchen heat-sealer bolted to it. He thought then that the simple kitchen device, a thing made to preserve food, set the style for his entire lab. Investigators might marvel over the inspired adaptations here, the mach
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 nes and devices put to uses for which they had never been intended.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Now, he remembered what he had forgotten to do, the thing that had sent him hurrying back down into the lab. The thermite bombs! Of course. He moved carefully around the lab, setting \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
the timers, then out into the basement where there were more devices.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Back up to the kitchen then and a bowl of dry cereal. The food made him sleepy and he set about brewing coffee, but decided he would rest his head on his arms at the kitchen table f\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
or a few minutes first. He had until night to leave.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      When he awakened, it was 12:11 and still daylight. He felt rested, but his back was sore from sleeping bent over the table. He could still hear children playing in the alley.

     He splashed cold water on his face at the kitchen sink, dried it on a dishtowel, then went into the bedroom and completed his packing. He took his suitcases down to the power wagon and began climbing back up the stairs to the kitchen, inten

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Rage engulfed him\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      He could hear a woman\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s voice shouting in the alley beh\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ind his house: \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Jimmeeeee! Jimmeeeee! You come here this instant!\'94

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      A vague sense of amusement came over him. He picked up the softball and went out onto the back porch. A young woman in a blue\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 housedress came through his gate from the alley and stopped in the backyard. She held the right ear of a boy about ten. The boy, his mouth contorted with pain and fear, his head twisted to accommodate the force holding him, pleaded:

s left of your DIC team. They seem to be so remarkably well met.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The secretary-general, Huls Anders Bergen, was a Norwegian educated in England. He had played a number of golf games with the man on the telephone and, on those occ\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
asions, they had been Hab and Adam. But Adam Prescott was firmly seated in his office as President of the United States today. There was no camaraderie in his voice.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      What is troubling him besides the obvious? Bergen wondered. It was something that Pre\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
scott did not want to say without elaborate preliminaries. The President appeared almost to be rambling. Why should he be talking about the procedures for sterilizing infected areas, and in the same breath as the tragedy at Denver? Those procedures had be
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 n worked out and accepted by all parties. Could it be something new in the costs?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 I agree, sir, that the economic realities are a prime consideration,\'94\loch\f0  Bergen said.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      He listened then while Prescott played out this gambit. The costs, although now \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 thousands of times greater than for any other disaster in human history, were clearly only a part of the President
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s immediate concern. Could he be thinking of sterilizing the Denver complex? Bergen wondered. The thought set his hand trembling with the te\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ephone against his ear. Bergen, a man who could talk bluntly when it was required of him, asked the question straight out.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 The facilities, not the people,\'94\loch\f0  Prescott said.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Bergen heaved a sigh of relief. There was too much death already. This mea\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
nt, however, that the rumored Colorado Plague Reservation was a reality. Infected men were to be isolated there. Why couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t the DIC team be sent there, then?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Could The Team work effectively without the DIC facilities?\'94\loch\f0  Bergen asked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Prescott d\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 id not think so.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
     Bergen weighed this factor in his mind. Obviously, Prescott and his advisors needed the Denver military facilities. The DIC complex there could be sterilized and made useful once more for the military. But what of The Team?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 They\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0  saved us days in identifying how the plague was spread,\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  Bergen said. \'93\loch\f0 And now that we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The President interrupted. He did not want to isolate such brilliant minds. But what was to be done with them wh\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
en the DIC was put to the fire? There was no comparable facility available in the Colorado Reservation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      On a sudden hunch, Bergen asked: \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Could they be sent to that new facility in England?\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The President was full of immediate and fulsome praise \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 for this brilliant suggestion. Only a genius could have thought of it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Bergen took the red phone away from his ear and stared at it, then brought the instrument back to his ear. Praise was still pouring from it. He stared across the office at the pane\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
led wall, the dark wood door. His desk chair was the best the Danes could supply and he leaned back in it, the phone still at his ear. A child could have made the suggestion to send those men to England, but Bergen was beginning to see the President
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s pol\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 tical problem.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      If the four infected men of The Team from the DIC were on an airplane, they might crash in an uninfected region. The crash site would require the \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Panic Fire.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Bergen raised this question with Prescott, listening for subtle hints i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 n the President\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s response.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      Yes, it was too bad the press and public would not accept the official label, \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Newfire.\'94\loch\f0 
 The words panic and fire had particularly noxious connotations when used together that way. More was beginning to emerge, however.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0    \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
  Even if a sealed aircraft did not crash, any new plague outbreak beneath the flight path could arouse powerful suspicions that the occupants had spread the infection, that it had somehow escaped and fallen upon more innocent victims. Demagogues were hav
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ng a field day and it would not do to provide them and the nut fringe of fanatics with more ammunition.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 I think the French might be willing to supply an escort of fighter planes,\'94\loch\f0  Bergen said. He looked at the door to the outer officer while Prescott\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 showered him with more praise. The French ambassador was among a group patiently waiting to have lunch with him. A word or two in quiet, perhaps?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Mr. President, you are more than generous,\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  Bergen said, cutting off the new flow of praise. \'93\loch\f0 Can you g\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
et volunteers for their flight crew?\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Again, the secretary-general listened. How fortunate that Doctor Beckett of The Team was a pilot \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 
 Air Force Reserve of all things! And Prescott had this knowledge at his fingertips. How well informed he was! And \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
a long-range aircraft could be made ready. The four men would drive themselves to the airport. They would take off, pick up their escort \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  and their car and its surroundings would receive its bath of Panic Fire.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Oh, there was one more thing. Could the\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0  secretary-general arrange for the four men to receive positions of \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 useful importance\'94\loch\f0 
 at the facility in England?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Useful importance, Bergen mused.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      He decided on a small fishing expedition. \'93\loch\f0 Is it the wisest choice to send them to England? That \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
lab at Killaloe in Ireland sounds impressive, especially with all of the new equipment you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 re providing.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 But you yourself suggested England,\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  Prescott said. \'93\loch\f0 I naturally assumed, since it was your first suggestion, that the British facility was the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 superior one.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 England it is,\'94\loch\f0  Bergen agreed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      It was all very clear now. If anything went wrong, then it was the idea of the secretary-general of the United Nations. It was Bergen, after all, who made the essential arrangements and pushed this p
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 roject through.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The red phone at Bergen\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s ear had still more tidbits to reveal, however. Prescott had things to say about O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
Neill. Bergen looked at his wristwatch while he listened. The hunger pangs were intense. Abruptly, he lifted his chin, startled\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 .
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 They think O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Neill\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s in England?\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  the secretary-general asked. \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Why do they think that?\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      As Prescott explained, it made a terrible logic. The victims, if they exposed him, might be afraid to retaliate lest the Madman loose an even more terribl\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e disaster upon them. O\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 Neill had threatened this in one of his letters, after all, and without more certain knowledge, no one could afford the assumption that he was bluffing.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Why not Ireland?\'94\loch\f0  Bergen asked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Ah, yes. O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Neill\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s features were kno\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 wn to some people in Ireland and even if he disguised himself\'85\loch\f0 
 well, the psychological people thought the Irish more prone to heedless revenge. Surely, O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Neill would have considered this. It was logical that he would want to hide in an English-speaking co\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 u
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ntry where he was little known and where he could blend into the background more easily. And there was England, a certain amount of chaos and disruption. And England was one of his target areas, a place where he had expressly forbidden those Outside to em

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
     It made terrifying sense, but even more, if accurate, it exposed the workings of a mind that could cut through a problem like the slash of a sword. Bergen had a certain awareness of this quality in himself. Complexities must 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 be reduced to manageable shape and size, even if this involved pulling from a complexity only that which could be managed. Mad, O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Neill might be, but also a genius \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 
 a true genius.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 How much certainty do they attach to this idea?\'94\loch\f0  Bergen asked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      A\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 h, yes: the Profile. This was more of the DIC Team\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s doing. Prescott and others believed The Team was \'93\loch\f0 getting into the Madman\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 \hich\f0 s mind, learning to think the way he does.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Bergen silently agreed. Perhaps they were doing this. Certainly, someone must do\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 I will make the preliminary arrangements for the flight to England,\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  Bergen said. \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
Someone from my office will call on your people to work out the details.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Having achieved his object without ever openly expressing it, the President was wil\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

ides. Of course, Bergen would be calling in the counter he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d just given. There would be a quid pro quo sometime. Well, that could be an advantage, too. Bergen was too good a politician to ask for something he knew he couldn

of reading upside down, glanced at what had caught the President\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s attention. Ah, yes \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Neill\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s atomic warning:

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The President finished reading, but remained silent, staring out the \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 window toward the Washington Monument.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      It was one of the President\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s more disconcerting habits, maintaining a long silence after a statement or a question by a subordinate. It was assumed during such periods that the President was thinking, which he o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ften was. But a silence unduly prolonged allowed considerable time for an underling to speculate about what the President might be thinking. Even unimaginative people can imagine very dark things under such conditions.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Only eigh\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t meters long, the sloop had cost him sixty thousand dollars at Brest \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 
 forty thousand for the vessel and twenty thousand in bribes. After the placing of one hundred and forty thousand dollars in a numbered Luxembourg account, he had thought his reserves \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ng which he had longed for Consuela\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 gotiations for the sloop and the port clearance had been protracted by the French awareness of urgency in him. The faster he wanted them to move, the slower the French had been and the higher the prices had gone.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      It was day forty-nine of the white pla\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
gue before he reached the fifty-degree latitude mark for his turn northward into the Irish Sea and neither the weather nor his balky little radio direction finder had cooperated. The sloop had been designed for protected waters, not for the open ocean or

he Irish Sea. The RDF worked only on some time schedule of its own, which might be an hour or more without malfunction and then again only a minute or so until he had to open it and check the connections and the batteries.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      But here was the damned Barrier Command guardian trying to deny him passage. Rage filled John as the rating repeated his command.

 moment he had seen the light cruiser. He thumbed the switch and pointed the horn at the rating, who was a doll figure up there in the wide hatch. In his best Irish accent, John demanded: \'93\loch\f0 Would y\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 
 have me go back to the mobs?\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      That should give them p\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ause. Stories of mobs attacking Irish and British nationals in Europe were prominent on the news broadcasts. Libyans, although fewer, were not faring any better.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The rating turned and spoke to someone behind him, then once more faced John with the lou\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 d hailer.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      It was an effort to lift his own loud hailer. John still did not feel fully recovered from whatever disease had stricken him. The long, almost sleepless sail from Brest had left him weak and easily angered. He let t

Where else can an Irishman go but Ireland?\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      He lowered his loud hailer and stared upward at the open hatch. The little sloop\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s erratic bobbing and tipping unsettled his stomach, but he forced himself to ignore this. No t
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ime to be sick. And there was something ludicrous about this encounter \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  Lilliput brought up to date. He could hear the rumbling of the light cruiser\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The rating once more turned his back on John and there obviously was a consultation going on up there. Presently, the rating\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\rquote \loch\f0 s mainsail and luffing it. John pulled the tiller into his stomach and sailed once mor\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  into the light cruiser\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      They had little choice up there, John felt. His accent was passable and, under these conditions, might even convince an Irishman. W\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ho else but a plague-driver Irishman would be fool enough to venture out here in this cockleshell? Sending him back to Europe would be sending him to certain death at the hands of a mob. Only a pronounced American accent had kept him free to act at Brest.
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 It had worked well enough as long as he had dollars to spend freely, but he had felt his welcome vanishing toward the end, swallowed up by the flood of bad news and mounting suspicions.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Presently, a derrick boom tracked out of the hatch where the rating had stood. It carried a motor launch in the same dull gray as the unrusted parts of the ship\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s side. The launch swayed crazily, then was \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
steadied by boat hooks. The boom extended to its limit. John heard the faint rumble and whine of the winch as the launch slid downward to stop just above the wave tops. Men appeared on the launch\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s deck. They moved purposefully to the cable hooks. Suddenl\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
, the launch plunged into a wave trough. Water splashed around it and the launching tackle swung clear. The small boat surged away from the light cruiser\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

 against the spray as he swung his boat into position about thirty meters upwind and dropped the power.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The launch was a low craft with a trunk cabin. Its sides gleamed with brass-bound ports. A lieutenant came out of the trunk cabin and pointed a lou\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

set him to shivering. The surge and pull of the towline had his stomach upset within a mile. He coughed in the stink of the launch\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      To the north, John could begin to see the glow of other ships, their lights bright against the lowering gr\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\loch\f0 s bow. An answering light came blinking from \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 H\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 angman\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s Point. The launch held to the left directly into the mouth of Kinsale Harbour, picking up speed now as it went with the incoming tide.

emorized. It was full dark now but a sliver of moon gave enough light to show the dark shoreline sweeping past. He felt the turn as they rounded into the south arm of the bay and there was the light at the Customs quay and the town pier. John stood up, st
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
adying himself against the boom. The tow slackened, almost spilling him. The lights of the launch swept past him on the left and it took up station behind. Abruptly, a long row of brilliant lights came on along the pier.

ix-volt bulb in the compartment. He could see the tide race sweeping him toward the pier. The former owner of the sloop had demonstrated the engine once. John primed it, set the throttle and choke, then pulled the starter line.

shallow wave, as the man on the sloop returned. As he jumped, another man cut the shoreline with an axe. The sloop surged out toward the waiting navy launch.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      An arc of flame leaped suddenly from the launch to the sloop. With a roar, the sailboat\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s bow\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The launch made a tight turn over the pl\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ace where it had gone down, a spotlight armed into the water, then the launch backed and turned with its stern toward the float. Once more the loud hailer blared:

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      As the booster truck moved into position, its operator wearing a spacesuit and breathing through tanks on the truck, Beckett went through the procedures automatically while his mind read him\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Beckett turned back to his instruments and controls, remind\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ing himself that this plane had to be flown Lear-fashion. This was a demanding aircraft susceptible to pilot-induced lateral oscillation. He had to be on his toes at every minute during takeoff and landing to avoid a Dutch roll, a half snap that could whi

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The radio interrupted his th\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 oughts with a weather check. Headwinds eased back slightly over the Atlantic but nothing to cheer about.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      Beckett heard it out, then thumbed his mike for intercom and said: \'93\loch\f0 Keep your seatbelts fastened when you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re not in the toilet. No unnecessary mov\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
     At the top of the hill he came out into an open area where the grass had been burned away all around a stone hut that stood in a depression off to his right. The moonlight revealed a flat stone-and-mortar construction with a
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  lean-to shelter at the rear. There was the burned ruin of a house directly across the road from it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      What should I do?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      He thought that if he entered the hut he might encounter an occupant who would kill him the minute he entered. But Cohn had sai\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 d something about priests.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Hello the hut,\'94\loch\f0  John called.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      There was no response.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Stone paving marked a narrow path between burned bushes down to the hut.

he black oblong of a doorway. He put a hand out to the latch but before he could lift it, the door creaked open. A candle flared and he discerned a brown-faced man in a black cassock. The candle held high, the man stared back at John without a word.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      J\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ohn found his voice. \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 They said\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  I\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  some clothing?\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The cassocked man stood aside, nodding John into the hut. The dark figure closed the creaking door, put the candle on a wall-bracket shelf and went through a low opening into the shed at the rear of 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 the hut. He returned presently with a mound of clothing in his arms. John accepted the clothing, noting then the empty look in his benefactor\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Blind?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      No, the cassocked figure moved with too much purpose and he had known where to put the cl\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 othes in John\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s hands. John looked around him, found a low chair on his left beneath the candle. He put the clothing there and began dressing. The underwear was a full suit of long Johns, white and soft. He felt better the minute he had pulled this garmen
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  over his chilled body. There was a pair of black-and-gray tweed trousers, a rough woolen shirt of dark green, a yellow woolen pullover.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John stared at his companion while he dressed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Are you a priest?\'94\loch\f0  John asked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Without speaking, the man\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  inclined his head in agreement.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Have you taken a vow of silence?\'94\loch\f0  John asked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Again, the head inclined.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John looked down at his bruised and bleeding feet. The priest also looked down.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Do you have shoes?\'94\loch\f0  John asked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Once more, t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
he cassocked man went into the shed at the rear, merging with the shadows there. Spooky, the silent way he moved, John thought. There was a thud, then a creaking sound from the shed. Presently, the priest emerged carrying a pair of worn brogans and a pair
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
of thick socks in green wool. John accepted them gratefully. He sat on the low chair to ease the socks over his sore feet. The brogans felt long enough but too wide. It helped when he tightened the shoelaces.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      All this time, the priest stood silently a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 bove him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John stood.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The priest held up a hand for silence. One hand went under the cassock and em\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
erged with a small notepad and a pencil attached to it by a short length of string. The priest scribbled on the pad and passed it to John.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      Taking it to the candle, John read: \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Take the Cappoquin road. There are signs. Go on to Caher. Ask there.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The priest removed the pad from John\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ding off beyond the hilltop. John could see the way entering a stretch of high hedges there, the growth black in the moon shadows.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The priest nodded and, once more, a hand went under the cassock.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Expecting the notepad\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
, John almost missed the long knife when it came slashing out at him from beneath the cassock. John jerked backward, the knife narrowly missing his throat. His assailant merely stood there, the knife held motionless at the end of its swing.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Never taki\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ng his attention from the man, John stumbled backward up the stone path to the road.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      All that time, the cassocked figure stood there, a lethal statue.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      At the road, John turned and ran toward the hedge-bordered stretch. The road dipped and then ro\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
se. John ran, panting and glancing backward whenever he could, stopping only when he came out of the hedges onto another hilltop where the road curved left along a ridge. He sat down on a stone wall to catch his breath and keep watch back along the way he
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 had come. There was no sound of pursuit.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Was that really a priest back there? An insane priest, perhaps? Then:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Cohn knew! He expected me to be killed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      It was quiet on the hilltop, only a faint soughing of wind in the gorse. He was thankful f\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
or the warm clothing. The attack at the hut was unsettling, though. Things were not what they appeared here.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      When he had recovered his breath, John set off more slowly.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Daylight found him in another river valley. He stopped at a rusted gate that once had been painted white. Brick\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 pedestals stood on each side, their mortar falling away in irregular patches. On the far side of the gate, an overgrown single track with grass on the crown led away into thick stands of maple and pine. Nettles and mallow bordered the edges of the track.
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 John glimpsed stone shapes rising from the growth off to his left and realized he was looking at a cemetery. He felt weak with hunger and his throat was dry.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Cappoquin? he wondered. Would it be safe to go where the cassocked man had directed him?

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Donnell glanced l\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 eft and right at his companions and once more Herity sensed that flare of near panic. Who was it? What was it? He studied O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
Donnell\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s companions behind the table.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Alex Coleman, seated on O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Donnell\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s left, would not have been recognized by many of his \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
old newspaper contemporaries in the preplague Dublin. Since the deaths of his wife and children at the hands of a Spanish mob, Coleman had devolved into a simmering container of rage. His hands often trembled with it or with the aftermath of drink, which 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e had taken to as a man come back to the Church driven by the whip of his sins. Coleman\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s thin features, still as dark as an Armada castaway\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s, had acquired a questing, thrusting look, something almost furtive, as though he were a hunting animal stalking \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ts prey. The most dramatic change was the removal of the hair from his head. Once thick and black with a deep wave across the crown, it now was kept shaved to no more than a shadowy stubble.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      There was rage in Coleman and perhaps something else, Herity\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  thought, as he shifted his attention to O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Donnell\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s other side. Now Herity focused because this was the most important member of the trio \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  Fintan Craig Doheny. None of the three would admit that importance, Coleman because he did not care, O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Donnell out
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 of pride, and Doheny because it was not his nature to lift his head out of the pack.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Herity had made it a point to learn something about Doheny when the man had been made secretary for plague research in the new Government of All Ireland. Doheny had b\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
een born to an Athlone family that had produced many priests and nuns but no medical doctors \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 until Fin came along.\'94\loch\f0 
 Right now, he had the look of a beardless but still jolly Father Christmas in mufti. His face was round and benign, framed in a curly fuzz\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
of light blond hair. Widely set blue eyes stared out of this face at a world that he appeared to find amusing.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      It was a mask, Herity decided. Doheny had flat lips with smile creases at the corners and a rather short, narrow nose with flaring nostrils \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
that two generations of medical and nursing students at Dublin College had learned to read for their own survival. Jolly as he might appear, Fin Doheny was notoriously savage to \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 slackers\'94\loch\f0 
 and the flaring of his nostrils was an infallible signal of the wr\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 th near eruption.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The fear came from Doheny, Herity realized. And from O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Donnell as well. What was it?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      These three constituted the Regional Committee for the Southeast Coast, originally an ad hoc emergency group that had become formalized by use \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
and recognition that they held the power and knew how to use it. Kevin O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 Donnell had assumed the chairmanship early in their association, on the presumption that he \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 had the guns\'94\loch\f0  
\hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  which indeed he did because the power in the new government was divided b\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
tween the Beach Boys and the Regular Army. Herity knew this suited Doheny. It allowed him to sit back and \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 maneuver the pieces.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Alex Coleman did not care who directed the committee as long as actions were being taken that might eventually destroy the\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
 murderers of his family. There were some who claimed Coleman might try to escape Ireland and \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 infect every last unholy bastard still living in Spain.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      It was all three of them afraid of something, Herity sensed \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  but was it the same thing they all fe\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ared?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Kevin O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Donnell, having looked to his companions for agreement with what he was saying, and taking their silence for that agreement, now favored Herity with a predator\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s grin, a pouncing look of sadistic pleasure.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Herity recognized the look\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 , having suffered from it on previous occasions. Since setting off the bomb at the Grafton Street corner, Herity had lived a rabbit\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 
s life, blamed by those who knew of his hand in the bombing for \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 bringing down the wrath of God upon us all.\'94\loch\f0  Since the pla\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ue, he had lived in constant fear that his role might become general knowledge.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      To anyone he trusted to listen, Herity protested: \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 How was I to know?\'94\loch\f0  O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Donnell, who had been area commander of Herity\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s group, had refused to accept this excuse. Singlin\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 g out Herity as a special target, O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
Donnell had seized on any opportunity for bedevilment. Herity suspected that something worse than any previous punishment was about to come. He tried to draw into himself, preserving his energies for an opportunity to e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 cape. This made him appear more solid, more tightly coiled. Herity was one of those people many called \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 well knit,\'94\loch\f0 
 as though God had sat there with a pair of long needles doing up the substance of Herity in a workmanlike fashion until the whole persona w\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s finished.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Misinterpreting Herity\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s posture, Kevin O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Donnell thought: That Herity! He acts like he owns every place he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s in!

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Kevin O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 Donnell looked at Coleman. \'93\loch\f0 What\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 that you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 re saying, Alex?\'94

\'94\loch\f0  He spat on the floor beside him and looked around, hoping there might be a bottle somewhere near to\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  soothe his sudden thirst.

\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Donnell said: \'93\loch\f0 I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 m still looking to your past mistakes, Joseph.\'94\loch\f0  His voice low and sad, O\hich\f0 \rquote \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Donnell added: \'93\loch\f0

 a small fireplace. Bricks of peat were stacked with a dish of matches to one side on the hearth. He noted the afghans on the chair backs: crochet work. A knitting basket sat beside one of the chairs, a green mound of knitted fabric, apparently unfinished

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Jo\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 hn stood entranced by the timeless feeling of the scene. The boat was a black thing with a hull that rippled against the water\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John debated whether to break from his cover and run. What danger lay in that dark boat? He studied the oarsman. The hands on the oars were pale white against all of th\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
at black. The motions of the shoulders held his attention for a moment: muscular contractions of the shoulder blades as the man swept the oars back for each new stroke.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      As the boat neared John\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s side of the lake, it came to him that the blue object in\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 the stern and the lumpy green darkness in the bow were other human forms. There were gray-clad legs poking from beneath the blue, a hand clutching a jacket hood over the head for protection from the cold mist. The pale blond head of a youth appeared sudd
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 nly from beneath the blue hood. Eyes of pale fawn-gold looked directly at John in the pine copse.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Should I run? John wondered. He did not know what held him here. The youth in the stern of that boat obviously had seen him, but the youth said nothing.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
     The boat slithered into the deep stretch of reeds at the shore. The green mound at the bow lifted, becoming a hatless man, long and shaggy blond hair, a narrow, almost effeminate face with pug nose and a sharp chin, a face dominated by light brown ey
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
s. The brown eyes, when they focused on John, were like a physical impact. John stood frozen in his position within the pines. Not taking his attention from John, the man lifted a green cap into sight and pulled it over his hair. He then brought up a worn
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 green packsack, which he slipped over his left shoulder by a single strap.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The oarsman had stood up and lifted an oar from its lock, using this as a pole to push against the bottom and thrust the boat through the reeds. The man in the bow said somethi\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ng over his shoulder to the oarsman, but the words were obscured by the noisy passage through the reeds. The boat rasped to a halt, on bottom almost half a length from the boggy turf that formed a strip between the pines and the reeds. At a motion from th
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  man in the bow, the youth in the stern stood and stepped over the side, wading and pulling the boat to the turf shingle.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Now, the oarsman turned. John confronted a cadaverous face pale under a black felt hat. Wisps of black hair touched by gray poked\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  from beneath the hat. The eyes were electric blue above a ship

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Still, she had been reluctant to crawl out the airlock into the other rooms when the workmen had finished there. Stephen had pointed out that the new chamber contained a television and a private room for

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      To Kate, the toilet facilities had been the ugliest part of living in the smaller tank. Never mind her training as a nurse and all the understanding of bodily functions. The little tank had only this pressure-operat

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
    The new quarters had vertical walls and a flat ceiling of steel. There was even brown-and-white lino on the floor and two electric burners on a bench beside a small pressure sink. Nothing near as grand as the kitchen in Peard\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      They still slept in the original tank\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 , but now it was on a big mattress left sterile in the new chamber. It sagged a bit toward the middle because of the tank\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Hearing her sobs, Stephen had broken off the conversation with Peard. His arms around her helped some, but the sobs died\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  off only when she grew too tired and lost in her misery to continue them.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Easy to see what Flannery was doing: he was desperately engaged in repairing the wreck of his armor. His life was pouring out through the h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
oles and he was grasping at the old arrogance, trying to fit the broken pieces in place, trying to restore the armor behind which he could stand untouched by his world while he made others dance to his whims. He was like a virgin compromised and there was

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Father Michael entered the open door of the weathered building, the others right behind. It was raining hard now, the drumming loud on the metal roof over them. Father Michael sniffed the air.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 He smells it!\'94\loch\f0  Herity said, \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 watching Father Michael with a look of glee. \'93\loch\f0 He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John sniffed. He could smell the latrine odors from the toilets next door, but Herity was right: there was the smell of beer in this room\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
, as though it had been spilled on the floor and allowed to soak in for years. John glanced around. It apparently had been a bath house and laundry, but only the sinks remained and someone had ripped them almost completely out of the wall. A disordered cl
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 tter of broken green glass and paper had been kicked into a corner. Otherwise, the floor appeared swept, only a few windblown leaves scattered across it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Herity dropped his pack onto the concrete floor by the door and ducked outside. He returned prese\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ntly, his hands caked with wet black dirt, five bottles of Guinness clutched in his arms.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John sipped at his drink. It was bitter and thirst-quenching. He co\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 uld feel the glow of it and thought about the cans of fish in his pocket. He brought them out.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Should we be making a meal here?\'94

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      He wants to get me drunk, John thought. Putting aside a half-full bottle, he stared out the doorwary, sensing the roiling mutter of O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
Neill-Within, screams hanging at the edge of awareness. Why do I move to the demands o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 f O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Neill-Within? he wondered. O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
Neill was always there, always watching, always aware of what was said and done around him, always with a special alertness to the pain of those he observed. John felt then that O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Neill-Within ran the O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
Donnell persona as \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 hough O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Neill were a puppetmaster playing the other persona on a special stage. And wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

 He passed the open bottle to Father Michael, who took it firmly and drained it without stopping for breath. The boy crawled into the corner near the ruined sink and sat there staring at the three men with a sullen expression.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Father Michael accepted another ope\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 n bottle from Herity. There was a glazed look in the priest\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

 He started to drink one bottle after another.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John found a wall to sit against where he could watch his companions. The boy took two more cans of fish from John and opened them, passing one\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 to Father Michael and the other to John before returning to his corner. Rain continued to drum on the metal roof. It grew darker and cold.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      There was something fermenting in the boy, John thought. There was a depth charge in him, pressure waiting to r\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
each that limit which would explode it. For the first time since he had seen the boy in the boat, John sensed a personality in him, a dim thing made of resentments and fears.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The boy glanced once at the priest. John, following his gaze, saw that Fathe\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 r Michael had curled into a corner and gone to sleep. A gentle wheezing sound could be heard from him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 Would y\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0  look at the little shagger there?\'94\loch\f0  Herity asked, his voice low.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John jerked his gaze around, realizing that Herity had been studying \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 him and had noticed his attention on the boy.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Now, what would his name be?\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  Herity asked. \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Does he have a name?\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  Herity drained a bottle and opened a fresh one. \'93\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The boy glared at Herity, unmoving, chin resting on his knees.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Herity appeared unaffected by the drink. He drained the new bottle and opened yet another, keeping his attention on the boy.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Should we be wearing our coats inside out?\'94\loch\f0  Herit\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 y asked. \'93\loch\f0 The faeries cannot follow you when you wear your coat that way. I

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 I could get the speech of him soon enough,\'94\loch\f0  Herity said. He drained the bottle and placed it neatly with the empties on his left. Leaning an arm on his pack, his head on h

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      What was all this talk of faeries? John wondered. Herity appeared to have his own sense of reality, his own saints and devils. Herity sober was a man whose judgments had been made long ago and never changed. B
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ut Herity drunk, and he must be touched by the liquor now, could be another matter. He had sounded argumentative and bitter, but now silent\'85\loch\f0

t hide in the drink. The Guinness could have brought acid memories and even feelings of guilt. For what would Herity feel guilty? For striking the priest?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Herity closed his eyes. Presently, a deep snore shook him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The boy stood up and cat-footed \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 across the room to stand over Herity. There was something in the boy\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s right hand but John could not make it out in the gathering gloom.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Without any warning, the boy fell on Herity, striking out with the thing in his hand which, John saw now, was the \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 razor-tip can opener. He was trying to slit Herity\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s throat, but the jacket collar prevented it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Herity, awakened in shock, grabbed for the arm with the opener and caught it. They fought silently, the wild strength of the young body revealed in a flai\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The boy appeared to react to the priest\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s voice. He subsided slowly, his eyes still blazing at Herity, but the weapon dropped from the boy\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      A strangely chastened Herity picked up the weapon. He looked at it as though he had never seen such a thing before, and felt at his collar where the thing had struck. He looked up at the boy then and, in
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0  a voice of contrition, said: \'93\loch\f0 I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sorry, lad. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 d no right to intrude on your grief.\'94

\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 .\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  And here he kept his radio and the listening devices and the electronic tools.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      He leaned back in the chair and puffed on his long, thin-stemmed pipe while waiting for the morning call from Doheny. He and Doheny had met on several occasions at interna\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
     It was midafternoon and they were plodding upward out of another shallow valley, the boy and the priest walking a bit ahead. The boy had been even more withdrawn since the fight in the bath house, his silence a deeper thing. Father Michae
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 l was accusatory. It was all Herity\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s fault.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s all that damned Yank\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s fault!

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      A Yank did it to us \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  made a ghetto of Ireland.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Herity had never thought of himself as a super-patriot \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  only a typical Irishm\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
an, bitter over the centuries of British oppression. He felt a tribal loyalty to his people and the land, a kinship of the rath. }{\i\dbch\af11\insrsid3359690 \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 There was a pulling force in the Irish earth}{
\dbch\af11\insrsid3359690 \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 , he thought. It was a memory that lived in the soil itself. It remembered and alwa\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ys had. Even if there were no more people, there would be something here, an essence that would tell how the Gaels had passed this way once.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Father Michael was talking to the Yank, not probing, not doing what he should to see if it was a mask the man \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 wore and the Madman himself underneath. Black thoughts in his mind, Herity listened.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 There are more ruins now,\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  Father Michael said. \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 You noticed that?\'94

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      They fell silent, passing another burned cottage whose walls butted up against the road. The blank windows exposed ashed tatters of curtains like w\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ounded eyelids.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Someone will answer for that, Herity thought.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      He felt the long Irish memory barbed like a spear. Offend it and someday you would feel the thrust and see your life welling from the wound.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      They crested the top of the hill then \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
and paused for breath, looking ahead to the long curve of another valley stretched out into mists at the upper end where a stream cascaded off black rocks, making its mark on the air with a moist screen that hid the farther hills. A hen cackled nearby.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0    \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0   Herity cocked an ear, hearing the gurgle of water; a brook or a spring.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 I hear water,\'94\loch\f0  John said.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      He crossed to the lower side of the road where tall grass covered a lon\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
g slope into trees. Finding a spot in the stone wall where he could swing himself across, he went a few paces out into the tall grass. The boy leaped the wall and joined the priest.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John looked up at the sky. Clouds were coming in, filling the western\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 horizon. He glanced at Herity, who waved for him to join the priest and boy. John climbed onto the wall and stood there looking across the open land before jumping down. The landscape had been defined by gray rock walls into green rectangles with a few c
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ttages, all black and roofless, sprinkled among them. He heard Herity cross the wall and come up beside him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 There\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s a beauty to it yet,\'94\loch\f0  Herity said.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John glanced at him, then returned his attention to the view. The thin mist reduced the middle\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 distances to muted pastels, a rolling meadowland with a river winding through it, tall trees and darker greens on the far side.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 Are you thirsty, Mister O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 Donnell?\'94\loch\f0  Herity asked. But he looked at O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Neill as he spoke.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 I could do with a cool drin\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 k of spring water,\'94\loch\f0  John agreed.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Father Michael\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  and the boy began walking toward the trees below the meadow.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The priest and the boy stopped short of the trees n\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ear a granite outcropping. Looking after them, Herity said, \'93\loch\f0 A fine man, the priest. Wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      At the jibing question, John felt O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 Neill-Within begin to rise. Panic threatened him, then rage. \'93\loch\f0 Others have suffered as much \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 as you, Herity! You

\par 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      A flush of blood darkened Herity\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s face. His lips tightened into a thin line and his right hand went toward the pistol under his jacket but hesitated and lifted instead to scratch the beard stubble on his chin.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0     \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0  \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Would you listen to us now?\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  he asked. \'93\loch\f0 We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 re like a couple of wains in\'85\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      He broke off, stopped by the loud report of a shot from down in the trees below them. In one motion, Herity knocked John off his feet into the grass, rolled away with one hand\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 in his pack, and before he stopped rolling had a small machine gun in his hands and was scrambling down to the shelter of the granite outcropping. He stopped there, peering down into the trees. John was right behind him, leaning up against the cold stone
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 .
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John peered around his edge of the rock, looking for the priest and the boy. Were they hurt? Who had shot and where had it been aimed? A limb cracked below him and Father Michael\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s pale and hatless head poked out of covering bushes under the trees. H\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Get your face back in here!\'94\loch\f0  Herity said. He yanked John back into the rock\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s cover\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 .

 He cradled the machine gun against his chest and leaned back, scanning the rock wall \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 bordering the road above them.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John looked at the weapon in Herity\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hands.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Seeing John\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s attention, Herity said: \'93\loch\f0 The Jews make fine guns, now don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t they?\'94\loch\f0 
 He whirled at the sound of swishing grass below them.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John looked up to see Father M\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ichael peering down at them. The black felt hat once more covered the brand-scarred forehead.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Father Michael turned and pointed at the gray gleam of more rocks just within the trees, the granite partly hidden by invading gorse.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Crouching low, Herity darted from behind the rocks and ran zig-zagging down the slope into the trees. They saw him duck behind the other rocks, then his voice called:

 left, right, left and into a pocket between the rocks where he saw the boy crouched, huddled into the blue coat. There was no sign of Herity. The boy stared at\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 John with a blank expression.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      There came the sound of running and Father Michael joined them, putting a protective arm around the boy.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      As they came down onto the central floor of the valley just before noon, John found it not as flat as it had appeared from the heights. Low hilloc\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

rd back in the trees and, once, as they rounded a granite-girt corner, there was a frightened cackling of a hen, a glimpse of brown feathers darting into the roadside bushes. Jackdaws were nesting in many of the chimneys. One giant maple standing alone in
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a field was decorated with a flock of collared doves, spots of soft fawn-gray speckled throughout the green. Vernal grass had taken over in many of the fields.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      Herity, walking beside John, sniffed the air and said: \'93\loch\f0 There\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s a certain smell to human oc\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 cupation that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John stared at the backs of the boy and the priest walking about twenty paces ahead. They were separated by the width of the road, the priest on the left, his head bowed, the knapsack riding high on his shoulder
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s. The boy sometimes darted to the middle of the road, glancing all around and occasionally bending his head to listen. The sound of their feet on the blacktop echoed between the road\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s rock-fenced boundaries. He began to look more closely at the empty va\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ley around them, the blacktop winding through it, over the hillocks and around them. There was a penetrating loneliness to this region, more empty by far than any wilderness. He sensed that it came from the fact people had lived here. The people had been 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 nd now they were gone. It was that kind of loneliness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 What happened to this valley?\'94\loch\f0  John asked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 Who knows? A simple rumor can empty a village. Maybe there was a mob. Maybe they burned it and left. You hear stories now: a cure and women living\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The road\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 wound its way around another hillock and the way was opened to a view of the trees along the river about a half mile ahead. Patchy cloud cover had let the sun shine through. A meadow glistened in the golden light on their left. Beyond it, elder trees sto
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 d thick along the riverbank, a tall hedge of them feeding on the flow of water. The elders swayed and beckoned in a soft breeze.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Parnell came to hunt in this valley,\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  Herity said. \'93\loch\f0 He had English manners, he did. His middle name, y\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  know, was Stuart

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John marveled at the way history was preserved here. It was not just the broad sweep of historical events and the dates of battles, but the intimate detail\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
s. Parnell had hunted in this valley! And when James Stuart abandoned the Irish to their foes, the Irish had renamed him \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Jim Dung.\'94\loch\f0  That was four hundred years ago and there was still venom in Herity\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 s voice when he uttered the name. And what of Parnell,\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 whose dream of reform had been killed by English exposure that a mistress had borne him children? Parnell was reduced to \'93

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      They walked in silence for a time. The river was audible now and they could see a stone bridge through a gap in the\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The priest and the boy stopped at the near abutment of the bridge and turned to watch their companions approach.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John walked out onto the bridge and looked downstream where water rippled over green rocks. The meadow visible through the tree\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\loch\f0  a sense of relaxation s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ttled over John. He accepted a slab of soda bread from the boy, a thin slice of white cheese on it. The boy put his elbows on the bridge\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s stone rail and watched the water while he ate. John could smell the perspiration of the boy, a sweet odor. The young\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 cheeks moved evenly with the chewing.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      What a strange child, John thought. A personality attempting to be transparent. Not here! But he was here. He ate the food Father Michael gave him. He called attention to things by looking sharply at them. He nest
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 led against the priest at times, a hurt animal seeking such comfort as he could find. And the attention he called to himself by his silence \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  discordant! A protest louder than any scream.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 I do not speak!\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      It was a thing repeated every time John \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 looked at him. As a protest, it was remarkably irritating \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  especially to Herity.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John looked at Herity and Father Michael standing there beside their packs at the end of the bridge, eating silently, not looking at each other. Herity occasionally glan\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ced at John and the boy. Herity, slowly eating his soda bread and cheese, keeping an eye on the road they had traversed, studying the land around them, looking for anything that moved, anything with a threat in it. Wary, that was the word for Herity. He w
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s as isolated as the silent boy, but the wariness was different. There! He had his pocketknife out again! Always manicuring his fingernails with that knife \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 
 meticulous and purposeful, an action like a habit. Cleanliness by rote. He had handsome fingers, \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 oo \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 
 long and slender but with power in them. John had seen them flex like claws, the tendons standing out along the knuckles.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The priest beside him: tall and haggard. Very tall. A Hamlet in a dark suit, the black hat pulled low over his eyes. The fea\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 tures put John in mind of \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 horse face
\'94\loch\f0  \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  that protruding jaw, the forward thrust at the neck, the strong nose and the dark eyes beneath those heavy brows, those thick and powerful teeth slightly protruding. Not a handsome man but it was a face not easily

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
     The boy beside John coughed and spat into the river. John tried to imagine the boy happy, playing merrily, some fat on him. He had been a toddler once, animated with joy of life, running to his mother. Such things were back there somewhere. 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 A sturdy lad. The flesh appeared healthy in spite of its emptiness. Dead but not dead.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      Why did the boy irritate Herity so? Time and again, John had seen Herity try to make the boy break that vow of silence. \'93\loch\f0 What good is such a vow? It won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t bring bac

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
     There was never an answer. The boy withdrew farther into his silent armor. The way he pulled his head into the blue anorak begged comparison with a turtle, but the comparison failed. The turtle might withdraw its vulnerable parts, staring
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 out fearfully until danger passed. This boy cowered in some far deeper place than the hood of his anorak. So deep it was that the eyes sometimes had not a glimmer of life in them. Everything the boy did at such times was transformed into a sullen patienc
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 far more stilled than mere silence. It was suspended animation, as though the life processes were put on hold while the flesh plodded along. The flesh remained merely the carrier of an inert spirit, a mass without internal direction.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Except when he t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 hrew rocks at the rooks.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
     Why did this boy hate the black birds so? Had he seen them settle onto beloved flesh? Perhaps that was the explanation. There could be bleached bones somewhere, cleansed by the birds, bones that once had carried someone this b

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
     John finished his soda bread and cheese, dusted his hand and crossed the bridge to where worn, irregular stone steps led down to the water. Beside the stream, he knelt and scooped the cold water into his palms, drinking it noisily, enjoying 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 the coldness on his cheeks. The water tasted sweet and faintly of granite. John turned his head at a sound beside him. The boy had joined him on the ledge beside the flow and was drinking with his face plunged into the current.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Face dripping water, th\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e boy looked up at John, a solemn, studying expression. Who are you? Should I be like you?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      In a sudden feeling of confusion, John stood, shook the water from his hands and climbed back to the bridge. How could the boy speak so plainly without words?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
    John stood at the bridge rail above the boy, not looking at him. There were low willows along the boggy ground beneath the elders. A cloud came over the sun then, throwing the world between the trees into a sudden chill gray. The river sounds were onl
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 river sounds, John told himself. Not people talking. Once this land might have been enchanted, but now the spirits were gone. It possessed only this emptiness, an absolute vitiation at one with the gnarled willows beneath the elders and the dank bog at t

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The cloud passed and once more the sun beat down between the trees, sparkling on the water, but it was different.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The boy joined John on the bridge. T\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 he priest came to them, carrying his pack in one hand, leaving Herity at the end of the bridge, staring off across the meadows.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John lifted his gaze to the path ahead. Behind the poplars could be glimpsed the deeper stain of evergreens clinging closely to the hillsides in neatly planted rows. There, within the deeper tree

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Velcourt thought of these things as he stood at the window of the Blue Room looking out toward the light traffic on Executive Avenue South. It was early evening and he had been sworn in as President less than three hou

 two reporters, one TV camera, two still cameras and one of those from the White House itself.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Velcourt knew he was going to miss the pragmat\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ic decisiveness of his predecessor. Adam had been a tough and experienced political in-fighter, a man who kept personal doubts carefully concealed.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      I tend to show my doubts, Velcourt thought. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll have to watch that.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      A Harvard professor had once \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 told the younger Velcourt: \'93\loch\f0 The uses of power require a certain measure of inhumanity. Imagination is a piece of baggage you often can\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 t afford to carry. If you begin thinking about people in general as individuals, that gets in your way. They are clay to\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 be shaped. That\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      In spite of such thoughts, or perhaps in contrast to them, Velcourt found the view in front of him pleasant. May was safe upstairs. One of their daughters had survived up in the Michigan Res\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
erve and they had only grandsons.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      It was an evening made for love songs, he decided. One of those soft evenings after a cold spell and with the promise of more warmth to come. Pastoral, Velcourt labeled it \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 
 quietly pastoral: the cattle munching away \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
at the tall pasture that had been the White House lawn. Guitar music, that was what it needed. Everything muted, not a hint of violence. Nothing to remind him of those ranked bodies burning at the capital\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s eastern perimeter. He could see the orange glow \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 hen he looked in that direction.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      No miracles kept Washington plague-free. It was simp\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ly that the area was occupied by people capable of brutal decisions. Manhattan was no different and it had the added advantage of a water perimeter no longer spanned by bridges, the tunnels blocked, and that outer buffer zone with its black fire lanes.

 a few pieces of armor and some automatic weapons might win them through the Washington Barrier. The attackers had been incapable of imagining the inferno effect from flaming splashes of Newfire, the hell temperatures and immunity to ordinary retardants. 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 A\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
lthough it provided no feelings of absolute security, Newfire was making a big difference in the landscape. Melted concrete tended to sober those who saw it. Velcourt did not try to fool himself, though: Individuals would still try to penetrate the barrie
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s. All it took was one infected individual and the plague was past the barriers. A very tenuous way to survive, Velcourt thought.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      He turned toward the darkening room and the open door to the lighted hallway. Secret Service agents could be heard in low\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      There was a stirring in the lighted hallway, hurrying footsteps. A Secret Service agent leaned in and said: \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Mister President?\'94

\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
raction of their former level. Who traveled anymore? A lot of the survivors lived communal lives. Only the Barrier Command needed great quantities of oil, and the Soviet Union was carrying most of that load.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Velcourt could hear another voice in the ha\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
llway now, the voice for which he had been delaying, Shiloh Broderick. The aging Broderick had come over from his Washington town house with a request that he be allowed to \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 brief the President.\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
 Along with the full-protocol request there had been a \'93\loch\f0 Dear\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Sam\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Velcourt bent and turned on a single floor lamp over a comfortable chair and seated himself opposite it in the shadows. Broderick, when he entered, saw the setup and u\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 nderstood.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      They shook hands while Broderick stood and Velcourt remained seated. Broderick took the chair under the light, its downward-pointing reflector bathing him in an unkind g\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 lare.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      This brought an appreciative chuckle.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Velcourt could see Shiloh debating whether to address the Presiden\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t as Sam. All of that diplomatic training won out.

and very wealthy people, a large contingent in the bureaucracy and retired from it, people whose careers had been predicated on \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 being right even when they were wrong.\'94\loch\f0 
 In a bureaucracy, Velcourt had learned early, the simple fact of being right did not w\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
n popularity contests, especially if someone higher up in the hierarchy was thus proven wrong. People who gained power in a bureaucracy, Velcourt had noted, tended to be media-minded. They wanted headline items, the more dramatic the better. Simple answer
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 , no matter how wrong they might be proven later. Drama, that was the thing \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 
 a most powerful advantage in a conference room, especially when presented in the driest and most analytical terms. Broderick had made a career on this one fact.

situations but a different level of awareness, more penetrating. It put survival first and political games second. Politics had been reduced to its most personal level: Who do I trust? Whenever that question was asked at a life-and-death level, there coul

 the valley much farther to the right of the slate-roofed mansion than he had expected. He could see a shallow swale on his right close with young pines, which thickened into taller pines at a higher crest beyond. At his left, a steep slope descended some

fifty meters before gentling into a deep bowl perhaps a thousand meters across. The chateau, three stories high and with four levels to its roofline, nestled into a black rock elbow at the far side of the bowl. Sheep cropped the meadow grass in front of t

\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ick green limbs beyond. It was an almost perfect screen to conceal anything outside the clearing.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      A masculine voice shouted from up toward the ridge on his right. John could detect no word in the sound. He felt exposed here, set out as a target for an\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
he problem this appellation raised in his plague-stricken world. When there were no women around, the title, Father, could take on cynical overtones. How could there be a Mother Church without Fathers? It aroused jealousies all dark and twisting in bereav
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 d people. Pope Luke knew about the questionings.

\loch\f0 \hich\f0 re able!\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Were these new abbeys in Ireland part of the new mysticism, spurred on by such questions?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Pope Luke was particularly disturbed by another passag\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e from this new literature quoted by a commentator:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 Our young idealists lived too long in the rat-holes of conspiracy. They came to think of this as their natural habitat and they resisted anything that might bring them out of such an environment. Bu

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      What way? the pope wondered. The commentator had not said and the papal queries to Ireland were not being answered.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The pope arose presently and went down the hall to his bedroom where his\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 robes had been laid out. He could hear the stirrings beyond his private quarters, all the trappings of the papacy being readied for another busy day. He longed for simpler times and often felt an active reluctance to leave a solitary station. Father Deme
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t he tolerated because messages needed to be sent, words recorded and transmitted.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      For his part, Father Dement dawdled over a fourth slice of toast generously spread with marmalade. }{\i\dbch\af11\insrsid3359690 \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The Philadelphia papacy\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

e thought. And there was no point in rushing through breakfast, no need to hurry after the pope and help him. This pope did things for himself, preferred it that way. His confessor complained that the pope rushed too swiftly through the holy necessities.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0     Why had the pope questioned the name given by the Irish to their illuminated manuscripts? After all of these months with Pope Luke, Father Dement found he still could be surprised by the man
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s vagaries and twists of thought. Perhaps it had something t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  do with the ceremonies planned for this morning here in Philadelphia.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 We must find our happiness in God.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Those were the pope\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s words. Literature of Despair, that did cast a pall over things. But it need not enter this day\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s activities.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      In\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 spite of every effort to stop him, the pope was moving ahead with steady determination toward the goal of the Philadelphia Pilgrimage. Some of the new cardinals, especially Cardinal Shaw, had raised objections, siding dangerously with President Velcourt 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
nd other leaders who pointed out the problems raised by the plague. Not only were large movements of people, many of them probably infected, frowned upon by governments, but isolated populations tended to react with independent violence against strangers 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 nd others trying to enter or pass through sanctuary regions.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Pope Luke remained adamant. Father Dement shook his head to correct himself. No, it was more a quiet persistence than anything else. It was as though God had spoken to him directly and the p\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ope moved in the sureness of such support. That was, of course, a thing internal to the papacy. Father Dement knew that the old belief could not be denied. He shared that belief himself. A pope consecrated moved thereafter within the special aura of God
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 concern. The unbroken line of holy succession \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  Christ to Peter to Pope Luke \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 
 carried an intrinsic promise of divine power and love. These very rooms here in Philadelphia, once part of the Church\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s regional government, possessed now that sense of divine \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 p

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Father Dement sopped up the last of his egg with a final bite of toast, drained his teacup and pushed himself away from the table, sighing. An acolyte housekeeper, his face properly subdued in holy awe, stepped 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 from a doorway\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s shadows where he had been hovering, glided forward and removed the dishes. Father Dement scowled. The young man was efficient, but it was not the same as the old days, not the same at all.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      This pope refused to have female help in the \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
Holy See, however. Were it not the pope himself evincing this behavior, Father Dement would have diagnosed it as pathological. Father Dement shuddered at the thought of the trouble he knew was coming. The pope had yet to say publicly what he said privatel
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 , but that could only be a matter of time, perhaps at the culmination of the first Pilgrimage\'85\loch\f0  if that Pilgrimage were allowed to occur.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 God has visited His judgment upon women for a divine purpose. The sin of women has been held up to our view. We h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ave been told clearly to remove that sin.\'94

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Father Dement stood and squared his shoulders. The Red Martyrdom, as the Irish called it \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 
 that had always been an ultimate demand that the Church could make upon its people. Father Dement felt, though, that \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
Pope Luke was inviting it. He was profoundly hostile to sexual union and no escaping that. He was antifemale. Father Dement dared to think it. The pope was listening too much to Father Malcolm Andrews, a Protestant minister who had joined the Church and r

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Moving to the window where Pope Luke had sat, Father Dement looked out over the city. He sensed a pattern beginning to emerge \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 \hich\f0  the Literature of Despair\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 would seek divine guidance. The argument between Pope Luke and President Velcourt had been going on for some time now but last night\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s call from Huls Anders Bergen, secretary-general of the United Nations, had raised the issue to a new intensity. Father D\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Pope Luke had replied in a \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 mild voice: \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 One does not defy God.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
Your Holiness, President Velcourt does not view the issue in quite that light. The President, with the backing of other world leaders, makes a distinction between the political papacy and the religious papacy.\'94

\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  to the low branches like the markers of a paper chase. The way was steep with exposed roots.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      With Herity leading, they slid and clambered down, grasping limbs to slow their descent, clinging to roots in the steeper parts. The trail emerged from the t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
rees onto a grassy ledge with man-made steps of rock down to a sloping meadow. A stone cottage with only half a roof sat in tall grass about fifty meters into the meadow. Beyond it, a series of rock-shelved terraces curved away to the right through closel
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  bordering trees. A sunken, weed-filled wagon track ran along the terraces at the bottom. It led at an angle, left to right, through two gates that had been left standing open.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Herity headed for the first open gate into the wagon track. They passed the ashes of what probably had been a small \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
byre with a pile of manure beside it. Grass grew thick on the manure and bushy weeds already were sprouting in the burned area. The wagon track sloped up to the right along the rock walls of the terraces, which stepped down from twice a man\hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John stopped beside him. There was no sound of the priest and boy behind them. All were looking at the castle. It stood in a haze of trees and bushes with only the crenellated battlements fully exposed. 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
Behind the screening growth, splotches of color could be glimpsed on the walls. Ruined turrets and buttresses stood out against the morning sky like illustrations in a tourist brochure. John found himself thinking how sure it was that castles, even ruined
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ones, transformed a skyline into something cruel \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  as though fangs had been exposed.

oad. A paved drive directly opposite went up to a low wall below the castle, turning right there and up onto a flat parking area where the burned wreckage of a bus could be seen with one wheel over the wall. The whole vehicle, faded red-and-black, tipped

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Turning, Beckett affirmed that they were all here. The director had stopped beside the door. He closed it, turned his pale, veined face toward Beckett and nodded. The others were busy movi\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ng chairs up to the narrow table at one side of the office where the small conferences were held.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Beckett moved across the room slowly, thinking about the sales pitch he had to make. Some things did not have to be reaffirmed, he knew. Nucleic acids we\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Beckett t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ook his seat beside Danzas, looking across the table at Lepikov and Hupp. The director pulled a chair up to the end of the table and rested his elbows there.

on an overgrown track through the inevitable granite walls. John found himself pleasurably anticipating walls and a roof overhead. They had spent the previous night fireless, crouched in an abandoned hay shed while wind drove the rain around them.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Ins\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      A bro\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John went to on\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John thought of Gannon. That single pistol shot. Suggestive. Gannon had been a man ready to die, anxious for it even. Too sensitive and deep for these times. How had Gannon judged the four strangers

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Lightning struck nearby, the thunder close and loud. The darkness outside seemed t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 hicker, more dense afterward.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      They were four different people bound together for different reasons, John decided. The lack of symmetry in the group bothered John. There was a dangerous disparity here. Was it Herity-the-hunter who did not belong? It fe
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 lt no better with him outside.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Rain began to pour onto the cottage roof. A leak near the wall opposite the fireplace produced a steady drip-drip-drip that splashed toward the packs by the door. John moved them under one of the windows, resting the mac

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      It came to John that each of them was being carried along by an obsession. I must do O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Neill\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0

camping cold, sometimes snug in abandoned cottages, Herity led his party toward Dublin. They were eighteen days reaching the Wicklow foothills, another nine days circling around to come in from the northeast where they were not expected. And hardly a soul

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      To John, the trip became a constant careful sparring with Herity. The most casual conversation could be dangerous. One afternoon, they had passed a leaning signboard with one word on it: Garretstown. It had been cold

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      She played it now in the morning quiet of their confinement, her eyes closed, her feet tucked under her on the chair. Stephen could be heard where he sat across from her, the pages of his book \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
turning with an irritating rhythm.

Father Michael mentioned the birds. An ancient stone ruin stood off to the side of their track, rooks soaring around it. Beyond it, they could see the hills to the south of the city. Barren trees devoid of all green fanged the heights. Somewhere over ther

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Seeing undamaged buildings ahead, they hurried to beat\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 the storm. Their lane came out on a narrow paved road with an intact shed beside it, glass on the ends of the shed, a long bench at the rear, an empty wooden pocket there for timetables on a no-longer-existent bus line. The squall swept overhead as they 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      John stepped out of the shelter and stared around him. There was an emerald brilliance to the land, a beauty that he thought had been near enough to this for eons\'85\loch\f0 
 something to ignite in the human breast a lo\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

Neill-Within. Danger here!
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      He had felt immersed in peril since the encounter on the road above Dublin. Doheny had been the man with Kevin O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Donnell \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  a curly fuzz like b\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      As John started to respond, Doheny raised a hand for silence. John understood then: Doheny was the Grand Inquisitor. Someone else put the questions and applied the pain. Doheny observed and judged.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John studied the man. What was his judgmen\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      For the first time in this encounter, Doheny spoke, a deep and compelling voice. John was surprised at the gentleness of it \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  velvet, that voice.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 Let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s bring him along,\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  Doheny said. \'93\loch\f0 I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll need his fingerprints and we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John felt his mouth go dry. Fingerprints and dental pattern! O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
Neill-Within could be felt squirming. What evidence did the Irish Inquisitor possess? Nothing had been left at the college. Surely not at the house. Had it? Panic Fire had\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 been used there. He had heard it on the news while still in France.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      From that point, John had allowed himself to be moved along like a puppet, concentrating on presenting a bland expression \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  bored. Long-suffering.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The first half hour in Doheny\hich\f0 \rquote \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 s office had been bad. Waiting\'85\loch\f0 
 waiting. What would the fingerprints reveal? When would they take him for a dental examination? Then a telephone had rung. Doheny had lifted it from a hook beside his desk, speaking one word into it.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The charade had been played out, Doheny thought as he replaced the phone on its hook. This John Garrech O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Donnell had not broken. He now understood Herity\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
     Doheny swiveled his chair and looked out the window toward Kilmainham Jail. Should the suspect be turned over to Kevin? The jail was a slippery place where men had died for no better reason than a whim. The present regime was only reinforcing that r
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 eputation. Why did we choose that place for a seat of government? Doheny wondered. A terrible place, a monument to uncounted griefs. He knew the answer.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Because it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s large enough and small enough. Because it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s in Dublin. Because we had to bring oursel\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      For about twenty minutes then, John submitted to questioning\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 about his knowledge, particular emphasis on recombinant DNA. Doheny displayed a considerable knowledge of the subject, but John had sensed the limits quite early when the questions lapsed into the area of educated guesses. John detected easily the areas 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 here his own knowledge went far beyond Doheny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s, especially when they got onto synthesis interphases. The trick was to limit what was revealed in the answers.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      Doheny tipped back in his chair, hands behind his head. \'93\loch\f0 Where would you consider yourself m\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ost valuable?\'94

her you will tend to have a bias about disease. The plague ignites a particular susceptibility to that mistake.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John took a moment to respond. What was Doheny saying? Was he stalling? Had the Irish discovered nothing significant after all this time?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      When John failed to speak, Doheny said: \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
You are required to face absolute termination immediately. To the traditional researcher, diseases are things that run their course. Life goes on even if a particular case is not cured.\'94

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      It came to John then that Doheny was still probing, subtly and expertly seeking after O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Neill. As he thought this, John felt O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
Neill withdraw, deep within. Doheny was more dangerous than Herity. What had happened to Herity, the p\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 riest and the boy?

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Another armored car went in front about a hundred meters away, and two more followed, all three fully manned. There was a rocket launcher on the car in the van.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      There had been no sign of Herity since that last glimpse of him heading off for Kil\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 mainham Jail, and Father Michael nor any of the others could or would say where he had gone.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Father Michael leaned forward, dislodging the boy beside him and arousing a sleepy moan from him. The priest spoke to the driver, the words not audible to Joh\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 n, but the driver\hich\f0 \rquote

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The armored car bounced and jerked in the rough \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
spots. The road went winding up through hills, giving an occasional glimpse down through lanes of conifers toward the Irish Sea with houses and smoking chimneys \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 
 touches of glistening ice wherever John could see fresh water in the breaks. It was scenery \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 f such ordinary splendor that it produced a sense of electric disturbance in John, stirring O\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 Neill-Within to cavernous whimpers, small cries and always that awful scream waiting there in the caves of his mind. The view down to the sea should not appear u\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The driver turned to his companion and said something. John heard only the two words at the end, spoken louder as the rumblings of the armor\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ed car increased on a steepening climb. \'93

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Those two words at the end of a statement, the recurrence of those same two words and nothing spoken after them, struck John as a verbal mark of the new Ireland. This thought soothed O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Neill-Wit
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 hin and left John alone to reflect.

ught about his departure from Doheny that morning. It had been dark before dawn, cold in the office. The light over Doheny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

 a stoop-shouldered old fellow who took the papers in a knobby-knuckled hand, straightening them on the desk before departing with them. Not a word spoken between the two men the whole time.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John had busied himself moving around the office,\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 looking at the photographs on the walls, peering closely at them in the dim light. He stopped at one, caught by the mystery of a partly defaced sign on a brick wall. He tried to make out the wording.

That sign was in Derry. Belfast was the central point for gathering intelligence.\'94

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John turned slowly, reluctantly. Doheny gazed up at him benignly, a glint of cynical humor in the dark eyes. The man appeared so like a fuzzy-haired doll there under \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
the yellow light, the morning painting gray on the window behind him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 We had something close to sixty thousand souls there then,\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  Doheny said. \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Now\'85\loch\f0  I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John moved away from the wall, going around the desk to the stiff wooden chair. Something in those photos had contaminated him! The chair was cold and hard beneath him. Doheny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      As he sta\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
red out the slit in the armored car, John thought about that conversation. The convoy was crossing a long stretch of high bog with newly cut turf ricks neatly thatched, a patch of dark plastic at each peak weighted there by stone. It was such an ordinary 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 cene that he could feel it once more arousing O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Neill-Within.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Father Michael turned suddenly and stared at John.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 They\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 re still cutting turf,\'94\loch\f0  John said.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      Father Michael spoke in a low voice, not to disturb the boy beside him. \'93\loch\f0 The hydroelect\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ric dam at Ardnacrusha was blown away early. We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John noted that the priest had put on a V-necked gray sweater with white buttons under his black suit. He had exchan\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0

 been hand-knit, thick yarn and the slight imperfections that only the hand could impart. John had stood on the stones, aware of the damp cold in the morning. There were patches of blue overhead, the mist lifting. His attention kept coming back to the old
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 man standing there so watchfully silent, the thin chest under the gray sweater.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      His wife\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hands made that sweater, John thought. Even as John thought this, the old man pulled the sweater close around him against the chill. The thing gapped with a mis
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 sing button at the bottom. The knitting had a begrimed look as though it had never been washed, and John thought: The old man wants that second-hand touch of her in this garment that her fingers worked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      He heard the whisper of O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 Neill-Within then: \'93\loch\f0 Is\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0  there nothing left that Mary touched?\'94

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The old man looked away at some noise outside the courtyard, bent his head to listen and, when he turned back, his watchful stare was gone. It was a withered face, a witless eye and a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 mouth where the teeth were no more \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  and that was all. He spoke in a cracked voice:

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The old man in the courtyard remained bothersome. John felt\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  sympathy for him. It was the sympathy he felt for O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 
Neill. Both had suffered tragic bereavement. And what could the poor old fellow do about it? Guard a doorway? Run errands for Doheny, perhaps. Fill out his days until he died\'85\loch\f0  alone. John had not imagin\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      It was past midnight but Hupp did not know how much past. He had left his watch on his bedside table when answering the summons and had not been given time enough even to glance at it. A tough Royal Marine, someone H

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      There was a curved stai\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
rway at the far end of the hall. It took them up to a landing where Peard flung open a heavy oak door and escorted John into a library. Old portraits lined one wall above bookcases and stacks and a wheeled ladder. A small fireplace of Italian marble with 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
arved cherubs decorated the end of an open space where chairs and one heavy table had been set out. The room smelled of pipe smoke and old books. John found himself being introduced to at least ten men. He lost count after the third. They were mostly twee

\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ,\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 but the priest obviously was praying. Peard was of that school which thought of prayer as an extremely personal thing, not to be shared with others. Watching someone pray embarrassed him. Whenever he was in church he only mouthed the prayers silently, aw

aving sped the short route to Killaloe in a fast convoy with motorcycle outriders. He had been on the phone, talking to Wycombe-Finch, an oddly one-sided conversation with the Englishman apparently not speaking much. Doheny had written on a pad for Peard

 Doheny pointed to Peard and gestured at the TV monitor on the corner of the desk, its \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 camera still focused on the library and the position where John had performed at the blackboard. Doheny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      What would he do if she screamed at him? she wondered. She felt like screaming. What a dumpy little prison this was. More than six months confined like this! And when she complained, all Stephen could do w

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The lorry eased ahead in low gear\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 f fire could be seen on the surrounding hills.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      It was cold on the pier and getting colder. Stephen found a flashlight and pointed it at Kate. There was a glassy look of fear in her eyes.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      He turned off the to\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 rch and crawled under the blankets beside her. They could hear the cables being moved and adjusted against the chamber\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The chamber lurched and they felt it\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Steady the thing, you idiots!\'94\loch\f0  a voice shouted.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 winging stopped. There came a sickening drop. Kate emitted a small shriek. The descent stopped, then resumed at a steadier pace, ending abruptly with a thump.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Kate wondered about that remark as they got under way. She heard the rumbling surge of powerful engines, then smooth movement detected mostly by watching the spotlights at the do\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The smooth movement changed suddenly to a steady fore-and-\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

     Only yesterday, Kate thought, she had been complaining because nothing changed in their quarters. The temperature had always been kept so annoyingly warm. She had used much of the morning to sort and fold their few items of clothing. A lucky thing.

\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Doheny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s glance fell on John. The Madman was staring once more at the head in the jar. What did he find so fascinating about poor Alex\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

I speak of a pattern which ranges from Stalingrad to Antioch, from Bir-sin-aba to Mai Lai, and much farther because it is not always found in momentous battles, but sometimes in very small conflicts.\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Ignore this pattern and we slay this world finally with ignorance. Recognize it and our values change. We will know then what to preserve.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Father Michael fell silent for a moment and glanced back at the boy, who stood staring at him with a look of wo\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
nder. Could that young lad understand? Was this the only mind in the room worth addressing?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Doheny felt himself deeply moved by the priest\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s words. God! The man was an Irish orator from the old tradition. The jurymen were obviously disturbed by him. T\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
hey had planned this so carefully. Bring in the boy at the end, put it to him: Would he kill O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Neill? There was justice in it. What had that boy ever done to O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
Neill? Kevin said the boy had agreed privately: He would pull the trap and do it with a curse. \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 H\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 e would light the match, pull the trigger\'85\loch\f0  anything.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The door behind Doheny burst open with a crash. A uniformed member of Kevin\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s guard came rushing across the room. \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Sir!\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
 he called even before stopping in front of the table. \'93\loch\f0 The word is out that w\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e have O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Neill! We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve had to close the gates! Thousands of people \hich\f0 \endash

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      John allowed himself to be led in a stumbling scramble across the junk and around the stacked wood. The boy awaited them there in an arched passage of moldy stone. The floor underfoot was slippery with slime and there
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  were upturned stones, puddles of water. The smell of sewage seeped through the cracks.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Doheny listened to the mob sounds overhead. The thumping of many feet could be felt. The gunfire had been reduced to a few scattered shots. Father Michael pushed J\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ohn down the passage ahead of him. The boy led. There was faint light ahead, but it was dark and odorous in the tunnel. Presently, they saw patchy daylight ahead framed in bushes and partly blocked by an iron grating. Father Michael waved them all to a st
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 p at the grating, listening. The mob was a dim sound behind them. No more gunfire. Doheny realized they had stopped in a small stone hut piled on both sides with rusty gardening tools \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Rows of earthenw\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
are pots had fallen from rotted shelves and the broken shards ground underfoot with bits and pieces of wire and rust-eaten cans. Daylight leaked through chinks in the stone and through a doorway partly blocked by a gate of rusty iron and thick shrubbery.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0     John closed his eyes and hugged his arms close. He breathed in shallow gasps, flexing and tensing his fingers.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The boy crept out under the shrubbery and could be heard moving around the hut.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Doheny touched one of John\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hands and was rewarded\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  with an abrupt upward jerking of the head, eyes wide open and glaring.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      Father Michael waved for Doheny to stay and went after the boy. He returned in a moment to say: \'93\loch\f0 This hut sits beside an old glass house and there\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Where had that boy got to? A sudden chilling thought welled up in Doheny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s awareness: Kevin had said the boy was ready to spring the ha\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ngman\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      A noise at the doorway brought his attention away from John. The boy slipped through the opening. He appeared subdued, more like his silent self. He gestured for them to follow hi\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
m and went back outside. The bushes swished with his passage.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
     Father Michael ahead and Doheny behind, they got John out of the hut into the open air. It was an overgrown park with tall evergreens all around, a glimpse of the lough through the trunks. A narrow stone-flagged walkway with bushes overhanging it led
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  away from the lough. The boy was not to be seen.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Single file with Father Michael still leading and Doheny bringing up the rear, they forced their way along the flagstone walk. Bushes constricted the passage; limbs whipped at them. Father Michael turn
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ed his back on the obstructions and pulled John along, feeling for the flagstones with cautious steps. Doheny held a warding arm in front of his face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      They emerged presently through a hedge screen onto a narrow macadam roadway, its surface pocked with\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 jagged potholes. The boy waited for them at the hedge and, as they emerged, he turned and set off to the left away from the castle.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Doheny hesitated, listening. There wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t a sign of the mob, nor a sound. The silence felt sinister.

l ignored the stairs and went to the lift at the center of the long corridor. The guard at the lift opened the door for Father Michael and punched the button for the top floor.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Father Birney Cavanagh was waiting outside the lift as Father Michael emer\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ged on the top floor. There was no getting around the man and Father Michael was forced to stop.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 Ahh, there you are, Father Michael. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 ve been waiting for you.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Where had the Brits found this priest? Father Michael wondered. Oh, Cavanagh was a C\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
atholic priest, right enough. That had been confirmed. But he had been too long with the Gall. He even spoke with the accents of an Old Etonian.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 What is it you want?\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  Father Michael demanded. \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Just a word or two, Father.\'94\loch\f0  Cavanagh took Father Michael\loch\af0\dbch\af11\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 s arm and almost forced him into a corner beyond the lift.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Father Michael stared down at the other priest. Cavanagh was a cherubic little man with pale cheeks. There was an insecurity in his blue eyes, which seemed always to be looking for an avenue \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
of escape. Did he ever comb that gray hair? Father Michael wondered. It always seemed to have just come through a whirlwind.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 A good Irishman,\'94\loch\f0  he claimed to be. And wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t he out of St. Patrick\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s College, Maynooth, the same as Father Michael?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Ha\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 d he gone through the troubles there? Father Michael had inquired, seeking to trap the man in a lie.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 No. I was sent out ten years before.\'94\loch\f0  And that had proved to be true enough.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      But Cavanagh was seeing Kate and talking to her. And Father Michael\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
 did not like the mood of the woman when Cavanagh had gone. The man was thick with the papal envoy who had come over from Philadelphia, too, and Father Michael did not like what he heard about that. There was talk of an accommodation with \'93\loch\f0 
the demands of \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 hese changing times.\'94\loch\f0 
 Father Michael knew what that meant: backsliding! Nothing good would come of it. There might even be a new schism. How could anyone respect a Catholic Church with its administrative seat in America? Things would not get back to norma
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  until Rome was restored.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 You cannot go in to Kate just now,\'94\loch\f0  Father Cavanagh was saying, his eyes avoiding Father Michael\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s. \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0   \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0    Father Michael put down a surge of anger. He knew Cavanagh sensed it, because the man released Father Michael\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s arm and stepped back defensively.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 What is happening in there?\'94\loch\f0  Father Michael asked, keeping his voice under careful control.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Father Michael sensed truth in Cavanagh\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s words and wondered if it would be right to force the issue. I am an envoy of the Ir\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ish state! But that had its strictures, too. An envoy must behave with proper decorum. He sensed Doheny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s fears coming true. That silly woman was famous all over the world. \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 The Woman in the Tank!\'94
\loch\f0  Something about her had caught the public fancy. It was t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e press doing it, of course! All of those sensational stories. And the baby being born during the storm of the channel crossing.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 When will I be permitted to see her?\'94\loch\f0  Father Michael asked.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Father Michael felt a hollow hardness in his stomach. Something bad was happening and he was to be kept out of it. Well, he would fight! Before he could speak, though, three \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Kate liked to sit by the window of her new room on the top floor of Huddersfiel\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 d\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s Administration Building when she nursed her baby. She knew the big mirror across from her was actually a window permitting the lines of men passing in the outside corridor to peer in at her. She had only to look up into the mirror to see what the pass
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ng viewers saw. She found it odd that she felt no embarrassment to know men watched her suckling Gilla at her breast.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      What a beautiful infant Gilla was becoming \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  the way her feet kicked, the wrinkles smoothing out, the look of alertness beginning to \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
appear in her eyes. She was going to have red hair, fine and silky the way Kate\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s own mother\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hair had been. How precious this infant was!
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      There had been a bad few days when they brought the serum and told her their decision. So cold-blooded they had\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 sounded, and she had screamed at the hulking Doctor Beckett, that ugly, lantern-jawed man with his gigantic mouth and the awful words coming out of it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 You and your husband can have many daughters, Mrs. Browder. You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve already demonstrated that, and\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Men in white coats had been holding her all through this, keeping her away from Gilla, not even letting Stephen be with her.

 her arm strapped down, a needle in it. She had lived through dreadful days, rocking Gilla and sobbing, fearing every moment that she would see the terrible plague symptoms i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  the infant.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      After the injection, Stephen had been permitted to come to her. Sounding almost like a priest, he had pleaded with her to \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 be calm and accept whatever God gives us.\'94\loch\f0 
 Stephen and the drugs had tried to be soothing but she could still think\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 back to that time and feel the awful tremors in her stomach. Gilla at her breast restored the calm. The blood serum had been produced in time. And now, everyone was giving blood serum. It was spreading out across the world like a wave.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The door behin\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
d Kate opened and she heard Stephen enter, the cautious movements. She saw him in the mirror, the way he looked at the mirror, not liking it but accepting the necessity. He had seen the long lines out there, the avid eyes peering in at mother and child. S
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ephen was resisting extensions of the viewing time but Kate was not sure this was right.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      In the whole world, the ratio of men to women was said to be ten thousand to one or worse. Here in England, of course, it was worse, although women saved by resou\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
rceful men were still being found and inoculated. A great new barracks establishment had been set up at Aldershot where the women were being protected. Kate wondered how those women felt about her own special status \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 
 the first one saved. The Woman in the\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
Tank. She knew there was pressure to get her back to Ireland, but she and Stephen were agreed that it was not yet safe. There were still Beach Boys with weapons roaming loose. And there were even women survivors being found in Ireland, although the storie
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  of their tribulations filled Kate with horror. Troubles! That was all Ireland ever seemed to experience.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      I was lucky.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      She sensed the power in her position. She was a symbol in a world agog with the announcements being made from Kangsha and Hudde\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 rsfield. Despite her nurse\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s training, she found some of the things being said almost too much to accept. Was it possible that she and Gilla might live five thousand years or more? They were saying that they could assure from conception whether a baby wou
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 d be male or female and that the female birth ratio was going to be held at \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 very high levels\'94\loch\f0  until the balance had been restored.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Kate found the thought of a five-thousand-year lifetime difficult to imagine. Five thousand years. What would she do wi\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
th all of that time? There would have to be more than producing babies, although she knew this would be her duty for years to come. Duty! Hard from the mouth of a priest, it was a male word\'85\loch\f0 
 a legal judgment. There would be no escaping it. She and Stephen\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 must produce more daughters.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      There were compensations, though. Kate found she rather liked her present female eminence, sensing that she must take advantage of it while she could. It would not endure in the face of this new genetic science. While it l
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 asted, it was exciting. The men paying court to her! That was the only way to describe it: courting. Not flirtation or simple attempts at seduction; the men were serious and it enraged Stephen.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Kate saw in the mirror that Stephen had taken a chair by \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
the smaller window behind her, the one looking out over the Huddersfield campus. The way he pretended to sit there reading his book! He was making a statement to the passing viewers: \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 This one is mine!\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      She liked that. Kate could feel the love of Step\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
hen, a warm current all through her body. A bond of terrible strength had been welded between them in the confinement of the isolation tank. She knew tiny detailed things about him now, weaknesses and strengths.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      He saved my life.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Each suckling mo\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 vement of the baby drawing life\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s own milk from her breast amplified the waves of loving heat she felt for Stephen. She sensed it deep in her abdomen.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The courting men were interesting, though, especially the Russian, Lepikov. What a charming man. Old\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 World charm. How amusing he was, lifting those thick black eyebrows at her, rolling his dark eyes. Poor man. His entire family dead somewhere in the Soviet Union. She felt so sad when she thought of it. How she wanted to cradle his head on her breast and
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 comfort him. Stephen would never permit that, though.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Its stomach full, the baby turned away from her breast and drifted into sleep, a tiny bubble of milk on her lips. Kate smiled down at her daughter, taking her time about covering herself. Gilla was
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  such a fascinating person to watch: the miniature face in innocent repose, that little dimple on her left cheek. What a blessing. What a miracle.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Kate glanced at her wristwatch: 10:10 A.M. She held the watch to her left ear. It still ran perfectly af\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ter all this time. She thought sadly of her mother presenting the watch to her the day Kate had gone off to nursing school.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Ahhhh, Momma, I wish you could see your own granddaughter, your own flesh and blood, alive and happy.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Perhaps it was a ble\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ssing, though, that Momma could only look down from heaven at this scene. A terrible price was being asked of women. Secondary husbands\'85\loch\f0 
 and even more. Kate felt a thrilling shiver at what she might be asked to accept. And how strange it was that the two \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
riests disagreed on this question. She dared not even raise the problem with Stephen. She knew how he would react. The tiny steel chamber with its ever-sounding airpump had created a singleness between them, though, and she suspected that Stephen knew wha
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  she was thinking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 The priest\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s here,\'94\loch\f0  Stephen said.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Just from his tone and before she looked up, Kate knew it was Father Cavanagh and not Father Michael. Stephen liked Father Michael and barely tolerated Cavanagh. Kate found this difficult to u\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
nderstand. Father Michael had married them back in Ireland, but he was such a hard man, that horse face never smiling. Father Cavanagh, however, was jolly and soothing. He spoke of a happy God who wanted pleasant things for his flock. Father Michael was s
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ern and threatening. He liked to talk philosophy with Stephen. It got so boring at times.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Father Cavanagh brought up a chair and seated himself in front of Kate, their knees almost touching.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 And how are we today?\'94\loch\f0  Father Cavanagh asked, his voic\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 e booming. \'93\loch\f0 Gilla\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Kate could see in the mirror how Stephen sneered at this. She knew what he was thinking. Cavanagh was a bit absurd with his Irish phrasings uttered in that odd English \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 accent.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      The priest leaned forward and tweaked one of Gilla\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s toes. The baby made a scowling face but resumed her innocent sleep when he removed his hand.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      In the other room, Stonar dropped the side of the crib and placed the baby on it. Gilla kicked her feet at him and gurgled with delight as he removed the wet diaper. The admiral helped hi\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Poor Hupp. His dreams of \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 being a power broker dispensing the scientific largesse with a careful hand \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  all gone. A cruel awakening into this new civilization.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 We are cows,\'94\loch\f0  Hupp had said.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      This had brought shocked silence to the other members of The Team, all four of the\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 m holding their last meeting, parting finally in the impersonal crockery, tile and chromium of Huddersfield
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s main cafeteria. There had been much noisy activity out beyond their corner table. Huddersfield had become a world crossroads, every facility over\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 oaded.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Joe is upset because our old team is breaking up,\'94\loch\f0  Lepikov explained.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Joe is right,\'94\loch\f0  Danzas said.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 You were not raised on the land as we were, Sergei,\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  Hupp said. \'93\loch\f0 You would not understand about poor, dumb cows. You never walk up to
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0  your cow and abuse it with your anger.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Danzas nodded sagely.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 You talk sweetly to your cow,\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  Hupp said. \'93\loch\f0 
You feed it well. You brush it and clean it and give it the best medical care. You treat it gently, but firmly, just the way Stonar and his\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  friends treat us. They know about cows. When the cow\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s head is in the stanchion, you lock the head there. Then you draw out the lovely, rich milk, being careful to strip out the last of the milk at the end lest the poor creature get sick on what is left \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 n it.\'94
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Beckett had recounted this to General Monk during the first part of the flight, watching the amusement and speculation in the man\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s eyes. How was a possible President of the United States taking to such an insight?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      This was one cow who was\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  going to be bullish, Beckett thought. After Monk left him alone, Beckett began framing a campaign speech.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0      \'93\loch\f0 We need a scientist in the White House. We need someone who knows the real dangers facing our world. We need someone capable of assessing the t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      It was a good slogan and might be an a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ttainable goal. The idea carried dangerous undertones of ownership, though. Were women to be hostages to a human future?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Hupp had been absolutely right about one thing: They need us, damn them!
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      There was mounting evidence that O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Neill had created\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 more than he knew in that crude laboratory of his. Now that people were once more moving about, crossing the old borders and the new ones, diseases never before observed were beginning to crop up. O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
Neill had probably been a walking factory of infections\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 .\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  They could trace his path by where the new diseases were appearing.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      God! One man had done this.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0      Was O\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 Neill still wandering insane in Ireland? It was possible. A form of that primitive respect for madness had come over the Irish. They were perfe\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ctly capable of harboring him, feeding and protecting him. The stories coming out of Ireland could not be discounted \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 
 rumors, myths. Cottagers were putting out dishes of food the way they once had done for the Little Folk. But now it was for the Madman. \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 A\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 nd the stories they told, and the press repeating them:
