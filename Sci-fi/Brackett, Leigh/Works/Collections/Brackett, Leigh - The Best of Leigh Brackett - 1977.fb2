    <p>Story-teller of Many Worlds</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>THE AUTHOR OF these stories was once, a good many years ago, a sunburned, muscular, small girl roaming the California beach in front of her grandfather's old house and playing at being a pirate. From what her family told me, I believe she was a hardy, adventurous little tomboy. But then something happened that wafted her away to realms more fascinating than the shores of Santa Monica Bay and imagined piracy.</p>
   <p>The something was a chance gift to her of a copy of Edgar Rice Burroughs' The Gods of Mars. In that classic of wild adventure on a haunted, dying Mars, Leigh found a basis on which to build new and vaster dreams. The book was an inspiration on which, in later years, she slowly built up her own colorful Mars, the planet of the wicked Low-Canal cities and desert tribesmen and lost secrets, the world of an ancient history full of magic and mystery.</p>
   <p>After her first stories about Mars, she began to create her own Venus. This was her very own planet, with such glamorous features as the Sea of Morning Opals and the Mountains of White Cloud. She was soon writing many adventure stories about it, progressing to wholly imaginary worlds.</p>
   <p>Here I intrude a personal note. I had met and become good friends with Leigh in the summers of 1940 and 1941, which I spent in California, and when I returned to Pennsylvania I read her earliest adventure stories with great interest. I thought they were fine, swinging action stories.</p>
   <p>In a magazine a couple of years later, I read the longest of her stories thus far, "The Jewel of Bas." Here was something that made me sit up and take notice. It was basically a thrilling adventure tale, but there had been some changes made. In the first place, the conventional hero and heroine of such stories were gone. Instead as the chief protagonists we had Mouse and Ciaran, two wholly believable and earthy (if the term may be permitted) people. The alien landscapes were sharply realized. And, as an old writer about androids myself, I was struck by the eeriness and power of the androids she had created. I well remember that when I'd finished this story I shook my head in surprise and said, "Hey, this gal can write!"</p>
   <p>Soon after that I read "The Veil of Astellar" and was equally impressed by that. This dark, haunting story of a man who betrayed his own people for love of an alien seemed to me—and still does—to have great power. I have always thought that the main character was modeled after Humphrey Bogart. Leigh refuses to confirm this, but I know that she, was a great admirer of Bogart at that time. And each time I read this story I seem to hear the somber, unforgettable Bogart voice, as a sort of voice-over.</p>
   <p>By coincidence, soon after writing "Astellar," Leigh was hired by Hollywood film producer Howard Hawks to work on the script of the now-classic Bogart-Bacall film, The Big Sleep . . . collaborating with the august William Faulkner, no less. From that she went on to other Hollywood film script jobs for a couple of years.</p>
   <p>But when I returned to California in the summer of 1946, the whole movie business had been closed down by a craft-union strike. And so by the end of 1946, when Leigh and I were married, she went back to her first love, science-fiction . . . back to Mars and Venus. And this time she created her most famous character, a great, half-wild, formidable son of Earth reared on savage Mercury—Eric John Stark, whose adventures she was to follow in later years in "The Ginger Star" series and others.</p>
   <p>One of her first stories about Stark took him to the Brackett Venus. I believe that "Enchantress of Venus" is one of the best of the Stark stories; it's the story of a half-wild man's struggle with the demoniac oligarchs of the Lhari, played out against that gorgeous Venusian background. The scenes in the strange depths of the gaseous Red Sea lead inexorably toward a final struggle . . . and a final failure.</p>
   <p>And indeed, this is a favorite and recurring theme of the Leigh Brackett stories—the theme of a strong man's quest for a dream and of his final failure when it turns to smoke and ashes in his hands. From the hero of her early "Astellar" story, to the Jim Beckwourth of her splendid historical novel Follow the Free Wind, her heroes seek something that they can never quite attain, yet their failure is not really defeat. "The Moon That Vanished," with its foredoomed quest for the mysterious Moonfire across the alien seas of Venus, is just such a story. And so is "Shannach—The Last," which works up a strange sympathy for the unhuman alien whose final defeat is also victory.</p>
   <p>The Brackett Mercury, lacking the glamor of Venus and the haunting sadness of ancient Mars—there is no history here, and no beauty—has a certain harsh authority even so. Nature is the chief villain, and a convincingly nasty one. Those were the days when we were all writing, in accordance with the latest guesses of astronomers and scientists, about a Mercury that kept one face always to the sun and the other to space and had a Twilight Belt between these extremes of savage heat and bitter cold, where there were alternate sunsets and sunrises due to the rocking of the planet, and where life might conceivably exist. Today those concepts have been shot down by better data from probes and more advanced scientific methods. But in those days they were valid, and Leigh's concept of a world where tremendous mountains went up literally beyond the sky, where the cliff-locked valleys were racked by violent storms and sudden rockfalls, and life was a precarious thing beset by heat and cold, thirst and starvation, is a nice little view of Hell. It was this world that molded Eric John Stark, but she used it in a number of other stories, of which "Shannach" is the best.</p>
   <p>Before leaving the other planets to return, fictionally, to Earth, Leigh wrote the last, finest, and saddest of all her Mars stories. "The Last Days of Shandakor" is a summing-up, a valedictory, of the Brackett Mars. The old glories of Mars are faded and lost, and the dreamers of Shandakor, summoning up as shadows the magnificence of the old legends, doubtless mirror the mood of the author taking leave of the wonderful world she had built up in her imagination since the time a little girl had read Burroughs on a California beach.</p>
   <p>The two stories, "The Woman From Altair" and "The Queer Ones," both take place on Earth, but with the outer universe as background. In both stories, visitants from other worlds are the key characters. Yet the two stories are done from exactly opposite viewpoints: one from the standpoint of strong sympathy with the strange visitant, the other from the viewpoint of the ordinary Earth folk who regard the visitant with fear and wonder.</p>
   <p>It was during this fictional return to Earth that Leigh wrote the most impressive of her full-length science-fiction novels. This was The Long Tomorrow, a prophetic tale of the world after an atomic war that has become a near classic. It originated from her interest in the Ohio village background that is now her home for half the year (the other half being spent in the California desert). When she first came to Ohio, she was greatly intrigued by the Amish folk here who continue their old, simple way of life in the midst of the modern World. This led her to remark that if modern civilization disappeared, the Amish would be perfectly fitted to live in a nonmechanical world—and that remark grew into a novel.</p>
   <p>I have always admired the ease with which Leigh can move from one kind of fiction to a completely different kind. In eighteen months, in 1956-57, she wrote not only The Long Tomorrow but also two novels of crime and suspense, The Tiger among Us, which became an Alan Ladd movie, and An Eye for an Eye, which formed the pilot for the "Markham" series on television.</p>
   <p>At the end of that period, she returned to Hollywood and to her old producer, Howard Hawks, to write Rio Bravo, the first of a series of John Wayne action-epics she has done. The other three were Hatari!, an African jungle story, and El Dorado and Rio Lobo, two more big Westerns. I well remember that when she was writing El Dorado, there was a difference of opinion between Leigh on one side and the producer and star on the other. They wanted to repeat a scene that had been used in Rio Bravo, and Leigh doesn't like to repeat. When I asked her how the argument came out, she said, "I told them it was too close to the scene in the earlier picture and that we couldn't use it, and Howard asked surprisedly, 'Why can't we?' and Duke Wayne said, 'If it was good once, it'll be just as good again.' " Leigh added, "I knew when I was outgunned . . . so I shut up and wrote the scene."</p>
   <p>Through the years, Leigh has continued to work for Hollywood in feature films and television. One of her most recent feature scripts was for the Raymond Chandler novel The Long Goodbye. The producer had read the script of The Big Sleep, done decades before, and decided that Leigh Brackett could write a Chandler film better than anyone else. So she flew twice to London for conferences, and did the script here in our Ohio farmhouse.</p>
   <p>But during all these years, she has continued to write science-fiction in between the film jobs. A film-writers strike, which gave her an unexpected vacation from Hollywood work, provided the opportunity to return to her favorite hero, Eric John Stark, in a series of novels set in a wider sphere than the old Stark stories. The Ginger Star and its sequels, The Hounds of Skaith and The Beavers of Skaith, launch Stark out of this little solar system into the starry universe, and the old Brackett Mars and Venus are laid aside for the gorgeous star-world of Skaith.</p>
   <p>I might mention that Leigh is talented in many fields other than writing. When she graduated from her girls' school in California, she immediately got a job in another school, teaching swimming and dramatics. Each subject came easily to her. She is to this day an expert swimmer I regret to add that also to this day she is a frustrated ham-actress.</p>
   <p>But her talents withstood a severer test when we moved to the Middle West. We had driven east in the summer of 1949 with Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore---two of our oldest friends, and an even earlier married-science-fiction-writing couple than ourselves. That was a trip we still treasure in memory. It contained that unforgettable moment when Henry encountered, all unaware, an elephant in darkest Iowa. . .</p>
   <p>Once back east, in 1950, we bought a home in the country. It was an ancient little Ohio farmhouse, built in 1819, a mile outside of the quiet, New England-like village of Kinsman. We did not realize that we were buying trouble . . . the house had been vacant and abandoned for years, it had never had electricity, and its water supply was a stone-lined well dug out sometime before the Civil War.</p>
   <p>Just as so many of today's youngsters are doing, we set in to restore the old wreck and return to life in the woods. I remember that the grass in the front yard was a yard high. Looking out from work inside one day, I saw Leigh out there sturdily dealing with the grass. She had bought an old-fashioned scythe up in the village and was swinging it with abandon. By some miracle, since she had never used a scythe before, she avoided cutting off her own ankles.</p>
   <p>That was only the beginning. In the succeeding few years, as we strove to make a habitable dwelling out of our Early American relic, Leigh helped me roll big stones out of the yard, lay down new floors, tack up wall paneling, and on at least one occasion, she was up on the roof helping tack shingles. In between times, for fun, we roamed the old woods, gathering blackberries and wild strawberries. In the evenings, she would "put up" jars of delicious jam and other delicacies . . . and next day return early to the typewriter and her current work.</p>
   <p>I recall that in the early winter of 1966 we had returned from Hollywood, where she had been working on the film script of El Dorado. We were, in a few weeks, leaving for a long-planned trip to Egypt, Persia and the Middle East. But in the past spring we had planted parsnips and now they had to be dug out of the freezing ground before we left. As we labored with forks and spades in the half-frozen mud of the garden to dig up those blasted parsnips—which seemed to be immovable, the more we tried to lever them up, the more we levered ourselves down into the mud—I chaffed her by saying, "This is a strange interlude between Hollywood and Egypt." She merely answered, "They're good parsnips and they have to be stored properly before we leave," and kept right on digging.</p>
   <p>The only outdoor activity Leigh would never engage in was hunting. I had bought a fine Sako .222 caliber rifle, ideal for potting the woodchucks that kept digging holes around the edge of our meadow. But when the lime came to use it, Leigh made strong objections. She had got used to watching the woodchucks from her window, when she looked up from her typewriter, and had sort of made pets of them, and did we have to kill them? Needless to say, my fine high-powered rifle with its beautiful variable telescopic sight has never been used.</p>
   <p>It might seem that for two full-time professional writers to marry and set up housekeeping together would create problems. But it never did. As we both knew how hard it is to write a story, we respected each other's work-habits from the first. When one of us goes to a workroom and to a typewriter, everything else, is ignored and we don't interrupt one another.</p>
   <p>I have sometimes been asked why we never collaborated on a story. Well, of course, during all these years we have done a good bit of what I might call unofficial collaboration. And quite recently we did our first full-dress collaboration on a story for Harlan Ellison's Last Dangerous Visions anthology. We decided to write a story that would feature our respective favorite heroes. Leigh's favorite, of course, is Eric John Stark. My own were the Star Kings, a gaudy bunch of far-future adventurers whom I wrote about years ago. So the story came out "Stark and the Star Kings," and will appear next year.</p>
   <p>We found, when we first began working together, that we had quite different ways of doing a story. I was used to writing a synopsis of the plot first, and then working from that. To my astonishment, when Leigh was working on a story and I asked her, "Where is your plot?" she answered, "There isn't any . . . I just start writing the first page and let it grow." I exclaimed, "That is a devil of a way to write a story!" But for her, it seemed to work fine.</p>
   <p>We never read each other's stories until they're finished. The trouble is that you can get thrown off your own ideas by suggestions, however good, from the other party. Pretty soon you're all confused and your story vanishes in a haze of contradictory elements. So we nearly always wait until we're finished.</p>
   <p>There was one exception. When Leigh wrote Follow the Free Wind, she was a little uneasy about my reactions to it. She knew that Jim Beckwourth, the valiant mulatto who went west in the old days and became one of the great mountain-men and pathbreakers of the West, was one of my heroes. She was afraid that I'd take umbrage at something she had written about Jim. So after she finished each section of the book, she had me read that section. Each time I was able to say, "That's perfect . . . just keep going."</p>
   <p>Although I had been writing professionally a dozen years earlier than Leigh, I learned a great deal from her. My own work was usually done at high speed, and often contained hasty pages. But I soon found that having a built-in critic right in the house pulled me up short when I did something too hurried and careless.</p>
   <p>She was, and is, the kindest of critics. When I would give her my finished story to read, if it was good she was enthusiastic in her comments. But if it was less than good, she never said, "This is faulty." Instead, she would unconsciously get a little wrinkled frown and would choose her words very carefully. She would say, "This or that minor character is very well done." Not a word about the fact that the whole rest of the story was unsatisfactory. But I very soon got the message. And so, when I got some kindly, cautious reaction like that from her, I would simply go and write the story over again.</p>
   <p>That was very good for my writing, after all those years of high-speed production for pulp magazines. And I think, and other people have told me, that my writing improved rapidly because of it. For that—and for at least a million other things—I'm grateful to her.</p>

    <p>Mouse stirred the stew in the small iron pot. There wasn't much of it. She sniffed and said:</p>
    <p>"You could have stolen a bigger joint. We'll go hungry before the next town."</p>
    <p>"Uh huh," Ciaran grunted lazily.</p>
    <p>Anger began to curl in Mouse's eyes.</p>
    <p>"I suppose it's all right with you if we run out of food," she said sullenly.</p>
    <p>Ciaran leaned back comfortably against a moss-grown boulder and watched her with lazy gray eyes. He liked watching Mouse. She was a head shorter than he, which made her very short indeed, and as thin as a young girl. Her hair was black and wild, as though only wind ever combed it. Her eyes were black, too, and very bright. There was a small red thief's brand between them. She wore a ragged crimson tunic, and her bare arms and legs were as brown as his own.</p>
    <p>Ciaran grinned. His lip was scarred, and there was a tooth missing behind it. He said, "It's just as well. I don't want you getting fat and lazy."</p>
    <p>Mouse, who was sensitive about her thinness, said something pungent and threw the wooden plate at him. Ciaran drew his shaggy head aside enough to let it by and then relaxed, stroking the harp on his bare brown knees. It began to purr softly.</p>
    <p>Ciaran felt good. The heat of the sunballs that floated always, lazy in a reddish sky, made him pleasantly sleepy. And after the clamor and crush of the market squares in the border towns, the huge high silence of the place was wonderful.</p>
    <p>He and Mouse were camped on a tongue of land that licked out from the Phrygian hills down into the coastal plains of Atlantea. A short cut, but only gypsies like themselves ever took it. To Ciaran's left, far below, the sea spread sullen and burning, cloaked in a reddish fog.</p>
    <p>To his right, also far below, were the Forbidden Plains. Flat, desolate, and barren, reaching away and away to the up-curving rim of the world, where Ciaran's sharp eyes could just make out a glint of gold; a mammoth peak reaching for the sky.</p>
    <p>Mouse said suddenly, "Is that it, Kiri? Ben Beatha, the Mountain of Life?"</p>
    <p>Ciaran struck a shivering chord from the harp. "That's it."</p>
    <p>"Let's eat," said Mouse.</p>
    <p>"Scared?"</p>
    <p>"Maybe you want me to go back! Maybe you think a branded thief isn't good enough for you! Well I can't help where I was born or what my parents were—and you'd have a brand on your ugly face too, if you hadn't just been lucky!"</p>
    <p>She threw the ladle.</p>
    <p>This time her aim was better and Ciaran didn't duck quite in time. It clipped his ear. He sprang up, looking murderous, and started to heave it back at her. And then, suddenly, Mouse was crying, stamping up and down and blinking tears out of her eyes.</p>
    <p>"All right, I'm scared! I've never been out of a city before, and besides . . ." She looked out over the silent plain, to the distant glint of Ben Beatha. "Besides," she whispered, "I keep thinking of the stories they used to tell—about Bas the Immortal, and his androids, and the gray beasts that served them. And about the Stone of Destiny."</p>
    <p>Ciaran made a contemptuous mouth. "Legends. Old wives' tales. Songs to give babies a pleasant shiver." A small glint of avarice came into his gray eyes. "But the Stone of Destiny—it's a nice story, that one. A jewel of such power that owning it gives a man rule over the whole world . . ."</p>
    <p>He squinted out across the barren plain. "Someday," he said softly, "maybe I'll see if that one's true."</p>
    <p>"Oh, Kiri." Mouse came and caught his wrists in her small strong hands. "You wouldn't. It's forbidden—and no one that's gone into the Forbidden Plains has ever come back."</p>
    <p>"There's always a first time." He grinned. "But I'm not going now, Mousie. I'm too hungry."</p>
    <p>She picked up the plate silently and ladled stew into it and set it down. Ciaran laid his harp down and stretched—a tough, wiry little man with legs slightly bandy and a good-natured hard face. He wore a yellow tunic even more ragged than Mouse's.</p>
    <p>They sat down. Ciaran ate noisily with his fingers. Mouse fished out a hunk of meat and nibbled it moodily. A breeze came up, pushing the sunballs around a little and bringing tatters of red fog in off the sea. After a while Mouse said:</p>
    <p>"Did you hear any of the talk in the market squares, Kiri?"</p>
    <p>He shrugged. "They gabble. I don't waste my time with it."</p>
    <p>"All along the border countries they were saying the same thing. People who live or work along the edge of the Forbidden Plains have disappeared. Whole towns of them, sometimes."</p>
    <p>"One man falls into a beast-pit," said Ciaran impatiently, "and in two weeks of gossip the whole country has vanished. Forget it."</p>
    <p>"But it's happened before, Kiri. A long time ago . . ."</p>
    <p>"A long time ago some wild tribe living on the Plains came in and got tough, and that's that!" Ciaran wiped his hands on the grass and said angrily, "If you're going to nag all the time about being scared . . ."</p>
    <p>He caught the plate out of her hands just in time. She was breathing hard, glaring at him. She looked like her name, and cute as hell. Ciaran laughed.</p>
    <p>"Come here, you."</p>
    <p>She came, sulkily. He pulled her down beside him and kissed her and took the harp on his knees. Mouse put her head on his shoulder. Ciaran was suddenly very happy.</p>
    <p>He began to draw music out of the harp. There was a lot of distance around him, and he tried to fill it up with music, a fine free spate of it out of the thrumming strings. Then he sang. He had a beautiful voice, clear and true as a new blade, but soft. It was a simple tune, about two people in love. Ciaran liked it.</p>
    <p>After a while Mouse reached up and drew his head around, stroking the scar on his lip so he had to stop singing. She wasn't glaring any longer. Ciaran bent his head.</p>
    <p>His eyes were closed. But he felt her body stiffen against him, and her lips broke away from his with a little gasping cry.</p>
    <p>"Kiri—Kiri, look!"</p>
    <p>He jerked his head back, angry and startled. Then the anger faded.</p>
    <p>There was a different quality to the light. The warm, friendly, reddish sunlight that never dimmed or faded.</p>
    <p>There was a shadow spreading out in the sky over Ben Beatha. It grew and widened, and the sunballs went out, one by one, and darkness came toward them over the Forbidden Plains.</p>
    <p>They crouched, clinging together, not speaking, not breathing. An uneasy breeze sighed over them, moving out. Then, after a long time, the sunballs sparked and burned again, and the shadow was gone.</p>
    <p>Ciaran dragged down an unsteady breath. He was sweating, but where his hands and Mouse's touched, locked together, they were cold as death.</p>
    <p>"What was it, Kiri?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know." He got up, slinging the harp across his back without thinking about it. He felt naked suddenly, up there on the high ridge. Stripped and unsafe. He pulled Mouse to her feet. Neither of them spoke again. Their eyes had a queer stunned look.</p>
    <p>This time it was Ciaran that stopped, with the stewpot in his hands, looking at something behind Mouse. He dropped it and jumped in front of her, pulling the wicked knife he carried from his girdle. The last thing he heard was her wild scream.</p>
    <p>But he had time enough to see. To see the creatures climbing up over the crest of the ridge beside them, fast and silent and grinning, to ring them in with wands tipped at the point with opals like tiny sunballs.</p>
    <p>They were no taller than Mouse, but thick and muscular, built like men. Gray animal fur grew on them like the body-hair of a hairy man, lengthening into a coarse mane over the skull. Where the skin showed it was gray and wrinkled and tough.</p>
    <p>Their faces were flat, with black animal nose-buttons. They had sharp teeth, gray with a bright, healthy grayness. Their eyes were blood-pink, without whites or visible pupils.</p>
    <p>The eyes were the worst.</p>
    <p>Ciaran yelled and slashed out with his knife. One of the gray brutes danced in on lithe, quick feet and touched him on the neck with its jeweled wand.</p>
    <p>Fire exploded in Ciaran's head, and then there was darkness, pierced by Mouse's scream. As he slid down into it he thought:</p>
    <p>"They're Kalds. The beasts of legend that served Bas the Immortal and his androids. Kalds, that guarded the Forbidden Plains from man!"</p>
    <p>Ciaran came to, on his feet and walking. From the way he felt, he'd been walking a long time, but his memory was vague and confused. He had been relieved of his knife, but his harp was still with him.</p>
    <p>Mouse walked beside him. Her black hair hung over her face and her eyes looked out from behind it, sullen and defiant.</p>
    <p>The gray beasts walked in a rough circle around them, holding their wands ready. From the way they grinned, Ciaran had an idea they hoped they'd have an excuse for using them.</p>
    <p>With a definitely uneasy shock, Ciaran realized that they were far out in the barren waste of the Forbidden Plains.</p>
    <p>He got a little closer to Mouse. "Hello."</p>
    <p>She looked at him. "You and your short cuts! So all that talk in the border towns was just gabble, huh?"</p>
    <p>"So it's my fault! If that isn't just like a woman . . . ." Ciaran made an impatient gesture. "All right, all right! That doesn't matter now. What does matter is where are we going and why?"</p>
    <p>"How should I—Wait a minute. We're stopping."</p>
    <p>The Kalds warned them with their wands to stand. One of the gray brutes seemed to be listening to something that Ciaran couldn't hear. Presently it gestured and the party started off again in a slightly different direction.</p>
    <p>After a minute or two a gully appeared out of nowhere at their feet. From up on the ridge the Forbidden Plains had looked perfectly flat, but the gully was fairly wide and cut in clean like a sword gash, hidden by a slight roll of the land. They scrambled down the steep bank and went along the bottom.</p>
    <p>Again with an uneasy qualm, Ciaran realized they were headed in the general direction of Ben Beatha.</p>
    <p>The old legends had been gradually lost in the stream of time, except to people who cared for such things, or made a living from singing about them, like Ciaran. But in spite of that Ben Beatha was taboo.</p>
    <p>The chief reason was physical. The Plains, still called Forbidden, ringed the mountain like a protective wall, and it was an indisputable fact whether you liked it or not that people who went out onto them didn't come back. Hunger, thirst, wild beasts, or devils—they didn't come back. That discouraged a lot of traveling.</p>
    <p>Besides, the only reason for attempting to reach Ben Beatha was the legend of the Stone of Destiny, and people had long ago lost faith in that. Nobody had seen it. Nobody had seen Bas the Immortal who was its god and guardian, nor the androids that were his servants, nor the Kalds that were slaves to both of them.</p>
    <p>Long, long ago people were supposed to have seen them. In the beginning, according to the legends, Bas the Immortal had lived in a distant place—a green world where there was only one huge sunball that rose and set regularly, where the sky was sometimes blue and sometimes black and silver, and where the horizon curved down. The manifest idiocy of all that still tickled people so they liked to hear songs about it.</p>
    <p>Somewhere on that green world, somehow, Bas had acquired the flaming stone that gave him the power of life and death and destiny. There were a lot of conflicting and confused stories about trouble between Bas and the inhabitants of the funny world with the sky that changed like a woman's fancy. Eventually he was supposed to have gathered up a lot of these inhabitants through the power of the Stone and transported them somehow across a great distance to the world where they now lived.</p>
    <p>Ciaran had found that children loved these yarns particularly. Their imaginations were still elastic enough not to see the ridiculous side. He always gave the Distance Cycle a lot of schmaltz.</p>
    <p>So after Bas the Immortal and his Stone of Destiny had got all these people settled in a new world, Bas created his androids, Khafre and Steud, and brought the Kalds from somewhere out in that vague Distance; another world, perhaps. And there were wars and revolts and raiding parties, and bitter struggles between Bas and the androids and the humans for power, with Bas always winning because of the Stone. There was a bottomless well of material there for ballads. Ciaran used it frequently.</p>
    <p>But the one legend that had always maintained its original shape under the battering of generations was the one about Ben Beatha, the Mountain of Life, being the dwelling place of Bas the Immortal and his androids and the Kalds. And somewhere under Ben Beatha was the Stone, whose possession could give a man life eternal and the powers of whatever god you chose to believe in.</p>
    <p>Ciaran had toyed with that one in spite of his skepticism. Now it looked as though he was going to see for himself.</p>
    <p>He looked at the Kalds, the creatures who didn't exist, and found his skepticism shaken. Shaken so hard he felt sick with it, like a man waking up to find a nightmare beside him in the flesh, booting his guts in.</p>
    <p>If the Kalds were real, the androids were real. From the androids you went to Bas, and from Bas to the Stone of Destiny.</p>
    <p>Ciaran began to sweat with sheer excitement.</p>
    <p>Mouse jerked her head up suddenly. "Kiri—listen!"</p>
    <p>From somewhere up ahead and to the right there began to come a rhythmic, swinging clank of metal. Underneath it Ciaran made out the shuffle of bare or sandaled feet.</p>
    <p>The Kalds urged them on faster with the jewel-tipped wands. The hot opalescence of the tips struck Ciaran all at once. A jewel-fire that could shock a man to unconsciousness like the blow of a fist, just by touching.</p>
    <p>The power of the Stone, perhaps. The Stone of Destiny, sleeping under Ben Beatha.</p>
    <p>The shuffle and clank got louder. Quite suddenly they came to a place where the gully met another one almost at right angles, and stopped. The ears of the Kalds twitched nervously.</p>
    <p>Mouse shrank in closer against Ciaran. She was looking off down the new cut. Ciaran looked, too.</p>
    <p>There were Kalds coming toward them. About forty of them, with wands. Walking between their watchful lines were some ninety or a hundred humans, men and women, shackled together by chains run through loops in iron collars. They were so close together they had to lock-step, and any attempt at attacking their guards would have meant the whole column falling flat.</p>
    <p>Mouse said, with vicious clarity, "One man falls into a beast-pit, and in three weeks of gossip a whole town is gone. Hah!"</p>
    <p>Ciaran's scarred mouth got ugly. "Keep going, Mousie. Just keep it up." He scowled at the slave gang and added, "But what the hell is it all about? What do they want us for?"</p>
    <p>"You'll find out," said Mouse. "You and your short cuts."</p>
    <p>Ciaran raised his hand. Mouse ducked and started to swing on him. A couple of Kalds moved in and touched them apart, very delicately, with the wands. They didn't want knockouts this time. Just local numbness.</p>
    <p>Ciaran was feeling murderous enough to start something anyway, but a second flick of the wand on the back of his neck took the starch out of him. By that time the slave party had come up and stopped.</p>
    <p>Ciaran stumbled over into line and let the Kalds lock the collar around his neck. The man in front of him was huge, with a mane of red hair and cords of muscle on his back the size of Ciaran's arm. He hadn't a stitch on but a leather G-string. His freckled, red-haired skin was slippery with sweat. Ciaran, pressed up against him, shut his mouth tight and began to breathe very hard with his face turned as far away as he could get it.</p>
    <p>They shackled Mouse right in back of him. She put her arms around his waist, tighter than she really had to. Ciaran squeezed her hands.</p>

    <p>The Kalds started the line moving again, using the wands like ox-goads. They shuffled off down the gully, going deeper and deeper into the Forbidden Plains.</p>
    <p>Very softly, so that nobody but Ciaran could hear her, Mouse whispered, "These locks are nothing. I can pick them any time."</p>
    <p>Ciaran squeezed her hand again. It occurred to him that Mouse was a handy girl to have around.</p>
    <p>After a while she said, "Kiri—that shadow. We did see it?"</p>
    <p>"We did." He shivered in spite of himself.</p>
    <p>"What was it?"</p>
    <p>"How should I know? And you better save your breath. Looks like a long walk ahead of us."</p>
    <p>It was. They threaded their way through a growing maze of cracks in the plain, cracks that got deeper and deeper, so you had to look straight up to see the red sky and the little floating suns. Ciaran found himself watching furtively to make sure they were still shining. He wished Mousie hadn't reminded him of the shadow. He'd never been closer to cold, clawing panic than in those moments on the ridge.</p>
    <p>The rest of the slave gang had obviously come a long way already. They were tired. But the Kalds goaded them on, and it wasn't until about a third of the line was being held up bodily by those in front or behind that a halt was called.</p>
    <p>They came to a fairly wide place where three of the gullies came together. The Kalds formed the line into a circle, squeezed in on itself so they were practically sitting in each other's laps, and then stood by watchfully, lolling pink tongues over their bright gray teeth and letting the wands flash in the dimmed light.</p>
    <p>Ciaran let his head and shoulders roll over onto Mousie. For some time he had felt her hands working around her own collar, covered by her hair and the harp slung across his back. She wore a rather remarkable metal pin that had other functions than holding her tunic on, and she knew how to use it.</p>
    <p>Her collar was still in place, but he knew she could slide out of it now any time she wanted. She bent forward over him as though she was exhausted. Her black hair fell over his face and neck. Under it her small quick hands got busy.</p>
    <p>The lock snapped quietly, and the huge red-haired man collapsed slowly on top of Ciaran. His voice whispered, but there was nothing weak about it.</p>
    <p>He said, "Now me."</p>
    <p>Ciaran squirmed and cursed. The vast weight crushed him to silence.</p>
    <p>"I'm a hunter. I can hear a rabbit breathing in its warren. I heard the woman speak. Free me or I'll make trouble."</p>
    <p>Ciaran sighed resignedly, and Mouse went to work.</p>
    <p>Ciaran looked around the circle of exhausted humans. Charcoal burners, trappers, hoop-shavers—the lean, tough, hard-bitten riffraff of the border wilderness. Even the women were tough. Ciaran began to get ideas.</p>
    <p>There was a man crushed up against them on the other side—the man who had hitherto been at the head of the column. He was tall and stringy like a hungry cat, and just as mean looking, hunched over his knees with his face buried in his forearms and a shag of iron-gray hair falling over his shoulders.</p>
    <p>Ciaran nudged him. "You—don't make any sign. Game to take a chance?"</p>
    <p>The shaggy head turned slightly, just enough to unveil an eye. Ciaran wished suddenly he'd kept his mouth shut. The eye was pale, almost white, with a queer unhuman look as though it saw only gods or devils, and nothing in between.</p>
    <p>Ciaran had met hermits before in his wanderings. He knew the signs. Normally he rather liked hermits, but this one gave him unpleasant qualms in the stomach.</p>
    <p>The man dragged a rusty voice up from somewhere. "We are enslaved by devils. Only the pure can overcome devils. Are you pure?"</p>
    <p>Ciaran managed not to choke. "As a bird in its nest," he said. "A newly fledged bird. In fact, a bird still in the shell."</p>
    <p>The cold, pale eye looked at him without blinking.</p>
    <p>Ciaran resisted an impulse to punch it and said, "We have a means of freeing ourselves. If enough could be free, when the time came we might rush the Kalds."</p>
    <p>"Only the pure can prevail against devils."</p>
    <p>Ciaran gave him a smile of beatific innocence. The scar and the missing tooth rather spoiled the effect, but his eyes made up for it in bland sweetness.</p>
    <p>"You shall lead us, Father," he cooed. "With such purity as yours, we can't fail."</p>
    <p>The hermit thought about that for a moment and then said, "I will pass the word. Give me the feke."</p>
    <p>Ciaran's jaw dropped. His eyes got glassy.</p>
    <p>"The feke," said the hermit patiently. "The jiggler."</p>
    <p>Ciaran closed his eyes. "Mouse," he said weakly, "give the gentleman the picklock."</p>
    <p>Mouse slid it to him, a distance of about two inches. The red-haired giant took some of his weight off Ciaran. Mouse was looking slightly dazed herself.</p>
    <p>"Hadn't I better do it for you?" she asked, rather pompously.</p>
    <p>The hermit gave her a cold glance. He bent his head and brought his hands up between his knees. His collar-mate on the other side never noticed a thing, and the hermit beat Mouse's time by a good third.</p>
    <p>Ciaran laughed. He lay in Mouse's lap and had mild hysterics. Mouse cuffed him furiously across the back of his neck, and even that didn't stop him.</p>
    <p>He pulled himself up, looked through streaming eyes at Mouse's murderous small face, and bit his knuckles to keep from screaming.</p>
    <p>The hermit was already quietly at work on the man next him.</p>
    <p>Ciaran unslung his harp. The gray Kalds hadn't noticed anything yet. Both Mouse and the hermit were very smooth workers. Ciaran plucked out a few sonorous minor chords, and the Kalds flicked their blood-pink eyes at him, but didn't seem to think the harp called for any action.</p>
    <p>Ciaran relaxed and played louder.</p>
    <p>Under cover of the music he explained his plan to the big red hunter, who nodded and began whispering to his other collar-mate. Ciaran began to sing.</p>
    <p>He gave them a lament, one of the wild dark things the Cimmerians sing at the bier of a chief and very appropriate to the occasion. The Kalds lounged, enjoying the rest. They weren't watching for it, so they didn't see, as Ciaran did, the breathing of the word of hope around the circle.</p>
    <p>Civilized people would have given the show away. But these were bordermen, as wary and self-contained as animals. It was only in their eyes that you could see anything. They got busy, under cover of their huddled bodies and long-haired, bowed-over heads, with every buckle and pin they could muster.</p>
    <p>Mouse and the hermit passed instructions along the line, and since they were people who were used to using their hands with skill, it seemed as though a fair number of locks might get picked. The collars were left carefully in place.</p>
    <p>Ciaran finished his lament and was half way through another when the Kalds decided it was time to go.</p>
    <p>They moved in to goad the line back into position. Ciaran's harp crashed out suddenly in angry challenge, and the close-packed circle split into a furious confusion.</p>
    <p>Ciaran slung his harp over his shoulder and sprang up, shaking off the collar. All around him was the clash of chain metal on rock, the scuffle of feet, the yells and heavy breathing of angry men. The Kalds came leaping in, their wands flashing. Somebody screamed. Ciaran got a fistful of Mouse's tunic in his left hand and started to butt through the melee. He had lost track of the hermit and the hunter.</p>
    <p>Then, quite suddenly, it was dark.</p>
    <p>Silence closed down on the gully. A black, frozen silence, with not even a sound of breathing in it. Ciaran stood still, looking up at the dark sky. He didn't even tremble. He was beyond that.</p>
    <p>Black darkness, in a land of eternal light.</p>
    <p>Somewhere then, a woman screamed with a terrible mad strength, and hell broke loose.</p>
    <p>Ciaran ran. He didn't think about where he was going, only that he had to get away. He was still gripping Mouse. Bodies thrashed and blundered and shrieked in the darkness. Twice he and Mouse were knocked kicking. It didn't stop them.</p>
    <p>They broke through finally into a clear space. There began to be light again, pale and feeble at first but flickering back toward normal. They were in a broad gully kicked smooth on the bottom by the passing of many feet. They ran down it.</p>
    <p>After a while Mouse fell and Ciaran dropped beside her. He lay there, fighting for breath, twitching and jerking like an animal with sheer panic. He was crying a little because it was light again.</p>
    <p>Mouse clung to him, pressing tight as though she wanted to merge her body with his and hide it. She had begun to shake.</p>
    <p>"Kiri," she whispered, over and over again. "Kiri, what was it?"</p>
    <p>Ciaran held her head against his shoulder and stroked it. "I don't know, honey. But it's all right now. It's gone."</p>
    <p>Gone. But it could come back. It had once. Maybe next time it would stay.</p>
    <p>Darkness, and the sudden cold.</p>
    <p>The legends began crawling through Ciaran's mind. If Bas the Immortal was true, and the Stone of Destiny was true, and the Stone gave Bas power over the life and death of a world . . . then . . . ?</p>
    <p>Maybe Bas was getting tired of the world and wanted to throw it away.</p>
    <p>The rational stubbornness in man that says a thing is not because it's never been before helped Ciaran steady down. But he couldn't kid himself that there hadn't been darkness where no darkness had even been dreamed of before.</p>
    <p>He shook his head and started to pull Mouse to her feet, and then his quick ears caught the sound of someone coming toward them, running. Several someones.</p>
    <p>There was no place to hide. Ciaran got Mouse behind him and waited, half crouching.</p>
    <p>It was the hunter, with the hermit loping like a stringy cat at his heels and a third man behind them both. They all looked a little crazy, and they didn't seem to be going to stop.</p>
    <p>Ciaran said, "Hey!"</p>
    <p>They slowed down, looking at him with queer, blank eyes. Ciaran blew up, because he had to relax somehow.</p>
    <p>"It's all over now. What are you sacred of? It's gone." He cursed them, with more feeling than fairness. "What about the Kalds? What happened back there?"</p>
    <p>The hunter wiped a huge hand across his red-bearded face. "Everybody went crazy," he said thickly. "Some got killed or hurt. Some got away, like us. The rest were caught again." He jerked his head back. "They're coming this way. They're hunting us. They hunt by scent, the gray beasts do."</p>
    <p>"Then we've got to get going." Ciaran turned around. "Mouse. You, Mousie! Snap out of it, honey. It's all right now."</p>
    <p>She shivered and choked over her breath, and the hermit fixed them both with pale, mad eyes.</p>
    <p>"It was a warning," he said. "A portent of judgment, when only the pure shall be saved." He pointed a bony finger at Ciaran. "I told you that evil could not prevail against devils!"</p>
    <p>That got through to Mouse. Sense came back into her black eyes. She took a step toward the hermit and let go.</p>
    <p>"Don't you call him evil—or me either! We've never hurt anybody yet, beyond lifting a little food or a trinket. And besides, who the hell are you to talk! Anybody as handy with a picklock as you are has had plenty of practice . . . ."</p>
    <p>Mouse paused for breath, and Ciaran got a look at the hermit's face. His stomach quivered. He tried to shut Mouse up, but she was feeling better and beginning to enjoy herself. She plunged into a detailed analysis of the hermit's physique and heredity. She had a vivid and inventive mind.</p>
    <p>Ciaran finally got his hand over her mouth, taking care not to get bitten. "Nice going," he said, "but we've got to get out of here. You can finish later."</p>
    <p>She started to heel his shins, and then quite suddenly she stopped and stiffened up under his hands. She was looking at the hermit. Ciaran looked, too. His insides knotted, froze, and began to do tricks.</p>
    <p>The hermit said quietly, "You are finished now." His pale eyes held them, and there was nothing human about his gaze, or the cold calm of his voice.</p>
    <p>"You are evil. You are thieves—and I know, for I was a thief myself. You have the filth of the world on you, and no wish to clean it off."</p>
    <p>He moved toward them. It was hardly a step, hardly more than an inclination of the body, but Ciaran gave back before it.</p>
    <p>"I killed a man. I took a life in sin and anger, and now I have made my peace. You have not. You will not. And if need comes, I can kill again—without remorse."</p>
    <p>He could, too. There was nothing ludicrous about him now. He was stating simple fact, and the dignity of him was awesome. Ciaran scowled down at the dust.</p>
    <p>"Hell," he said, "we're sorry, Father. Mouse has a quick tongue, and we've both had a bad scare. She didn't mean it. We respect any man's conscience."</p>
    <p>There was a cold, hard silence, and then the third man cried out with a sort of subdued fury:</p>
    <p>"Let's go! Do you want to get caught again?"</p>
    <p>He was a gnarled, knotty, powerful little man, beginning to grizzle but not to slow down. He wore a kilt of skins. His hide was dark and tough as leather, his hazel eyes set in nests of wrinkles.</p>
    <p>The hunter, who had been hearing nothing but noises going back and forth over his head, turned and led off down the gully. The others followed, still not speaking.</p>
    <p>Ciaran was thinking, He's crazy. He's clear off his head—and of all the things we didn't need, a crazy hermit heads the list!</p>
    <p>There was a cold spot between his shoulders that wouldn't go away even when he started sweating with exertion.</p>
    <p>The gully was evidently a main trail to Somewhere. There were many signs of recent passage by a lot of people, including an occasional body kicked off to the side and left to dry.</p>
    <p>The little knotty man, who was a trapper named Ram, examined the bodies with a terrible stony look in his eyes.</p>
    <p>"My wife and my first son," he said briefly. "The gray beasts took them while I was gone."</p>
    <p>He turned grimly away.</p>
    <p>Ciaran was glad when the bodies proved to be the wrong ones.</p>
    <p>Ram and the big red hunter took turns scaling the cleft walls for a look. Mouse said something about taking to the face of the Plains where they wouldn't be hemmed in. They looked at her grimly.</p>
    <p>"The gray beasts are up there," they said. "Flanking us. If we go up, they'll only take us and chain us again."</p>
    <p>Ciaran's heart took a big, staggering jump. "In other words, they're herding us. We're going the way they want us to, so they don't bother to round us up."</p>
    <p>The hunter nodded professionally. "Is a good plan."</p>
    <p>"Oh, fine!" snarled Ciaran. "What I want to know is, is there any way out?"</p>
    <p>The hunter shrugged.</p>
    <p>"I'm going on anyway," said Ram. "My wife and son . . . ."</p>
    <p>Ciaran thought about the Stone of Destiny, and was rather glad there was no decision to make.</p>
    <p>They went on, at an easy jog trot. By bits and pieces Ciaran built up the picture—raiding gangs of Kalds coming quietly onto isolated border villages, combing the brush and the forest for stragglers. Where they took the humans, or why, nobody could guess.</p>
    <p>The red hunter froze to a dead stop. The others crouched behind him, instinctively holding their breath.</p>
    <p>The hunter whispered, "People. Many of them." His flat palm made an emphatic move for quiet.</p>
    <p>Small cold prickles flared across Ciaran's skin. He found Mouse's hand in his and squeezed it. Suddenly, with no more voice than the sigh of a breeze through bracken, the hermit laughed.</p>
    <p>"Judgment," he whispered. "Great things moving." His pale eyes were fey. "Doom and destruction, a shadow across the world, a darkness and a dying."</p>
    <p>He looked at them one by one, and threw his head back, laughing without sound, the stringy cords working in his throat.</p>
    <p>"And of all of you, I alone have no fear!"</p>
    <p>They went on, slowly, moving without sound in small shapeless puddles of shadow thrown by the floating sunballs. Ciaran found himself almost in the lead, beside the hunter.</p>
    <p>They edged around a jog in the cleft wall. About ten feet ahead of them the cleft floor plunged underground, through a low opening shored with heavy timbers.</p>
    <p>There were two Kalds lounging in front of it, watching their wands flash in the light.</p>
    <p>The five humans stopped. The Kalds came toward them, almost lazily, running rough gray tongues over their shiny teeth. Their blood-pink eyes were bright with pleasure.</p>
    <p>Ciaran groaned. "This is it. Shall we be brave, or just smart?"</p>
    <p>The hunter cocked his huge fists. And then Ram let go a queer animal moan. He shoved past Ciaran and went to his knees beside something Ciaran hadn't noticed before.</p>
    <p>A woman lay awkwardly against the base of the cliff. She was brown and stringy and not very young, with a plain, good face. A squat, thick-shouldered boy sprawled almost on top of her. There was a livid burn on the back of his neck. They were both dead.</p>
    <p>Ciaran thought probably the woman had dropped from exhaustion, and the kid had died fighting to save her. He felt sick.</p>
    <p>Ram put a hand on each of their faces. His own was stony and quite blank. After the first cry he didn't make a sound.</p>
    <p>He got up and went for the Kald nearest to him.</p>
    <empty-line/>
   </section>
   <section>

    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>He did it like an animal, quick and without thinking. The Kald was quick, too. It jabbed the wand at Ram, but the little brown man was coming so fast that it didn't stop him. He must have died in mid-leap, but his body knocked the Kald over and bore him down.</p>
    <p>Ciaran followed him in a swift cat leap.</p>
    <p>He heard the hunter grunting and snarling somewhere behind him, and the thudding of bare feet being very busy. He lost sight of the other Kald. He lost sight of everything but a muscular gray arm that was trying to pull a jewel-tipped wand from under Ram's corpse. There was a terrible stink of burned flesh.</p>
    <p>Ciaran grabbed the gray wrist. He didn't bother with it, or the arm. He slid his grip up to the fingers, got his other hand beside it, and started wrenching.</p>
    <p>Bone cracked and split. Ciaran worked desperately, from the thumb and the little finger. Flesh tore. Splinters of gray bone came through. Ciaran's hands slipped in the blood. The gray beast opened its mouth, but no sound came. Ciaran decided then the things were dumb. It was human enough to sweat.</p>
    <p>Ciaran grabbed the wand.</p>
    <p>A gray paw, the other one, came clawing for his throat around the bulk of Ram's shoulders. He flicked it with the wand. It went away, and Ciaran speared the jewel tip down hard against the Kald's throat.</p>
    <p>After a while Mouse's voice came to him from somewhere. "It's done, Kiri. No use overcooking it."</p>
    <p>It smelled done, all right. Ciaran got up. He looked at the wand in his hand, holding it away off. He whistled.</p>
    <p>Mouse said, "Stop admiring yourself and get going. The hunter says he can hear chains."</p>
    <p>Ciaran looked around. The other Kald lay on the ground. Its neck seemed to be broken. The body of the squat, dark boy lay on top of it. The hunter said:</p>
    <p>"He didn't feel the wand. I think he'd be glad to be a club for killing one of them, if he knew it."</p>
    <p>Ciaran said, "Yeah." He looked at Mouse. She seemed perfectly healthy. "Aren't women supposed to faint at things like this?"</p>
    <p>She snorted. "I was born in the Thieves' Quarter. We used to roll skulls instead of pennies. They weren't so scarce."</p>
    <p>"I think," said Ciaran, "the next time I get married I'll ask more questions. Let's go."</p>
    <p>They went down the ramp leading under the Forbidden Plains. The hunter led, like a wary beast. Ciaran brought up the rear. They both carried the stolen wands.</p>
    <p>The hermit hadn't spoken a word, or moved a hand to help.</p>
    <p>It was fairly dark there underground, but not cold. In fact, it was hotter than outside, and got worse as they went down. Ciaran could hear a sound like a hundred armorers beating on shields. Only louder. There was a feeling of a lot of people moving around but not talking much, and an occasional crash or metallic screaming that Ciaran didn't have any explanation for. He found himself not liking it.</p>
    <p>They went a fairish way on an easy down-slope, and then the light got brighter. The hunter whispered, "Careful!" and slowed down. They drifted like four ghosts through an archway into a glow of clear bluish light.</p>
    <p>They stood on a narrow ledge. Just here it was hand-smoothed, but on both sides it ran in nature-eroded roughness into a jumble of stalactites and wind-galleries. Above the ledge, in near darkness, was the high roof arch, and straight ahead, there was just space. Eventually, a long way off, Ciaran made out a wall of rock.</p>
    <p>Below there was a pit. It was roughly barrel-shaped. It was deep. It was so deep that Ciaran had to crane over the edge to see bottom. Brilliant blue-white flares made it brighter than daylight about two-thirds of the way up the barrel.</p>
    <p>There were human beings laboring in the glare. They were tiny things no bigger than ants from this height. They wore no chains, and Ciaran couldn't see any guards. But after the first look he quit worrying about any of that. The Thing growing up in the pit took all his attention.</p>
    <p>It was built of metal. It rose and spread in intricate swooping curves of shining whiteness, filling the whole lower part of the cavern. Ciaran stared at it with a curious numb feeling of awe.</p>
    <p>The thing wasn't finished. He had not the faintest idea what it was for. But he was suddenly terrified of it.</p>
    <p>It was more than just the sheer crushing size of it, or the unfamiliar metallic construction that was like nothing he had seen or even dreamed of before. It was the thing itself.</p>
    <p>It was Power. It was Strength. It was a Titan growing there in the belly of the world, getting ready to reach out and grip it and play with it, like Mouse gambling with an empty skull.</p>
    <p>He knew, looking at it, that no human brain in his own scale and time of existence had conceived that shining monster, nor shaped of itself one smallest part of it.</p>
    <p>The red hunter said simply, "I'm scared. And this smells like a trap."</p>
    <p>Ciaran swallowed something that might have been his heart. "We're in it, pal, like it or don't. And we'd better get out of sight before that chain-gang runs into us."</p>
    <p>Off to the side, along the rough part of the ledge where there were shadows and holes and pillars of rock, seemed the best bet. There was a way down to the cavern floor—a dizzy zig-zag of ledges, ladders, and steps. But once on it you were stuck, and no cover.</p>
    <p>They edged off, going as fast as they dared. Mouse was breathing rather heavily and her face was white enough to make the brand show like a blood-drop between her brows.</p>
    <p>The hermit seemed to be moving in a private world of his own. The sight of the shining giant had brought a queer blaze to his eyes, something Ciaran couldn't read and didn't like. Otherwise, he might as well have been dead. He hadn't spoken since he cursed them, back in the gully.</p>
    <p>They crouched down out of sight among a forest of stalactites. Ciaran watched the ledge. He whispered, "They hunt by scent?"</p>
    <p>The hunter nodded. "I think the other humans will cover us. Too many scents in this place. But how did they have those two waiting for us at the cave mouth?"</p>
    <p>Ciaran shrugged. "Telepathy. Thought transference. Lots of the backwater people have it. Why not the Kalds?"</p>
    <p>"You don't," said the hunter, "think of them as having human minds."</p>
    <p>"Don't kid yourself. They think, all right. They're not human, but they're not true animals either."</p>
    <p>"Did they think that?" The hunter pointed at the pit.</p>
    <p>"No," said Ciaran slowly. "They didn't."</p>
    <p>"Then who—" He broke off. "Quiet! Here they come."</p>
    <p>Ciaran held his breath, peering one-eyed around a stalactite. The slave gang, with the gray guards, began to file out of the tunnel and down the steep descent to the bottom. There was no trouble. There was no trouble left in any of those people. There were several empty collars. There were also fewer Kalds. Some had stayed outside to track down the four murderous fugitives, which meant no escape at that end.</p>
    <p>Ciaran got an idea. When the last of the line and the guards were safely over the edge he whispered, "Come on. We'll go down right on their tails."</p>
    <p>Mouse gave him a startled look. He said impatiently, "They won't be looking back and up—I hope. And there won't be anybody else coming up while they're going down. You've got a better idea about getting down off this bloody perch, spill it!"</p>
    <p>She didn't have, and the hunter nodded. "Is good. Let's go."</p>
    <p>They went, like the very devil. Since all were professionals in their own line they didn't make any more fuss than so many leaves falling. The hermit followed silently. His pale eyes went to the shining monster in the pit at every opportunity.</p>
    <p>He was fermenting some idea in his shaggy head. Ciaran had a hunch the safest thing would be to quietly trip him off into space. He resisted it, simply because knifing a man in a brawl was one thing and murdering an unsuspecting elderly man in cold blood was another.</p>
    <p>Later, he swore a solemn oath to drop humanitarianism, but hard.</p>
    <p>Nobody saw them. The Kalds and the people below were all too busy not breaking their necks to have eyes for anything else. Nobody came down behind them—a risk they had had to run. They were careful to keep a whole section of the descent between them and the slave gang.</p>
    <p>It was a hell of a long way down. The metal monster grew and grew and slid up beside them, and then above them, towering against the vault. It was beautiful. Ciaran loved its beauty even while he hated and feared its strength.</p>
    <p>Then he realized there were people working on it, clinging like flies to its white beams and arches. Some worked with wands not very different from the one he carried, fusing metal joints in a sparkle of hot light. Others guided the huge metal pieces into place, bringing them up from the floor of the cavern on long ropes and fitting them delicately.</p>
    <p>With a peculiar dizzy sensation, Ciaran realized there was no more weight to the metal than if it were feathers.</p>
    <p>He prayed they could get past those workers without being seen, or at least without having an alarm spread. The four of them crawled down past two or three groups of them safely, and then one man, working fairly close to the cliff, raised his head and stared straight at them.</p>
    <p>Ciaran began to make frantic signs. The man paid no attention to them. Ciaran got a good look at his eyes. He let his hands drop.</p>
    <p>"He doesn't see us," whispered Mouse slowly. "Is he blind?"</p>
    <p>The man turned back to his work. It was an intricate fitting of small parts into a pierced frame. Work that in all his wanderings Ciaran had never seen done anywhere, in any fashion.</p>
    <p>He shivered. "No. He just—doesn't see us."</p>
    <p>The big hunter licked his lips nervously, like a beast in a deadfall. His eyes glittered. The hermit laughed without any sound. They went on.</p>
    <p>It was the same all the way down. Men and women looked at them, but didn't see.</p>
    <p>In one place they paused to let the slave gang get farther ahead. There was a woman working not far out. She looked like a starved cat, gaunt ribs showing through torn rags. Her face was twisted with the sheer effort of breathing, but there was no expression in her eyes.</p>
    <p>Quite suddenly, in the middle of an unfinished gesture, she collapsed like wet leather and fell. Ciaran knew she was dead before her feet cleared the beam she was sitting on.</p>
    <p>That happened twice more on the way down. Nobody paid any attention.</p>
    <p>Mouse wiped moisture off her forehead and glared at Ciaran. "A fine place to spend a honeymoon. You and your lousy short cuts!"</p>
    <p>For once Ciaran had no impulse to cuff her.</p>
    <p>The last portion of the descent was covered by the backs of metal lean-tos full of heat and clamor. The four slipped away into dense shadow between two of them, crouched behind a mound of scrap. They had a good view of what happened to the slave gang.</p>
    <p>The Kalds guided it out between massive pillars of white metal that held up the giant web overhead. Fires flared around the cliff foot. A hot blue-white glare beat down, partly from some unfamiliar light-sources fastened in the girders, partly from the mouths of furnaces hot beyond any heat Ciaran had ever dreamed of.</p>
    <p>Men and women toiled sweating in the smoke and glare, and never looked at the newcomers in their chains. There were no guards.</p>
    <p>The Kalds stopped the line in a clear space beyond the shacks and waited. They were all facing the same way, expectant, showing their bright gray teeth and rolling their blood-pink eyes.</p>
    <p>Ciaran's gaze followed theirs. He got rigid suddenly, and the sweat on him turned cold as dew on a toad's back.</p>
    <p>He thought at first it was a man, walking down between the pillars. It was man-shaped, tall and slender and strong, and sheathed from crown to heels in white mesh metal that shimmered like bright water.</p>
    <p>But when it came closer he knew he was wrong. Some animal instinct in him knew even before his mind did. He wanted to snarl and put up his hackles, and tuck his tail and run.</p>
    <p>The creature was sexless. The flesh of its hands and face had a strange unreal texture, and a dusky yellow tinge that never came in living flesh.</p>
    <p>Its face was human enough in shape—thin, with light angular bones. Only it was regular and perfect like something done carefully in marble, with no human softness or irregularity. The lips were bloodless. There was no hair, not even any eyelashes.</p>
    <p>The eyes in that face were what set Ciaran's guts to knotting like a nest of cold snakes. They were not even remotely human. They were like pools of oil under the lashless lids—black, deep, impenetrable, without heart or soul or warmth.</p>
    <p>But wise. Wise with a knowledge beyond humanity, and strong with a cold, terrible strength. And old. There were none of the usual signs of age. It was more than that. It was a psychic, unhuman feel of antiquity; a time that ran back and back and still back to an origin as unnatural as the body it spawned.</p>
    <p>Ciaran knew what it was. He had made songs about the creature and sung them in crowded market-places and smoky wine-shops. He'd scared children with it, and made grown people shiver while they laughed.</p>
    <p>He wasn't singing now. He wasn't laughing. He was looking at one of the androids of Bas the Immortal—a creature born of the mysterious power of the Stone, with no faintest link to humanity in its body or its brain.</p>
    <p>Ciaran knew then whose mind had created the shining monster towering above them. And he knew more than ever that it was evil.</p>
    <p>The android walked out onto a platform facing the slave gang, so that it was above them, where they could all see. In its right hand it carried a staff of white metal with a round ball on top. The staff and the mesh-metal sheath it wore blazed bright silver in the glare.</p>
    <p>The chained humans raised their heads. Ciaran saw the white scared glint of their eyeballs, heard the hard suck of breath and the uneasy clashing of link metal.</p>
    <p>The Kalds made warning gestures with their wands, but they were watching the android.</p>
    <p>It raised the staff suddenly, high over its head. The gesture put the ball top out of Ciaran's sight behind a girder. And then the lights dimmed and went out.</p>
    <p>For a moment there was total darkness, except for the dull marginal glow of the forges and furnaces. Then, from behind the girder that hid the top of the staff a glorious opaline light burst out, filling the space between the giant pillars, reaching out and up into the dim air with banners of shimmering flame.</p>
    <p>The Kalds crouched down in attitudes of worship, their blood-pink eyes like sentient coals. A trembling ran through the line of slaves, as though a wind had passed across them and shaken them like wheat. A few cried out, but the sounds were muffled quickly to silence. They stood still, staring up at the light.</p>
    <p>The android neither moved nor spoke, standing like a silver lance.</p>
    <p>Ciaran got up. He didn't know that he did it. He was distantly aware of Mouse beside him, breathing hard through an open mouth and catching opaline sparks in her black eyes. There was other movement, but he paid no attention.</p>
    <p>He wanted to get closer to the light. He wanted to see what made it. He wanted to bathe in it. He could feel it pulsing in him, sparkling in his blood. He also wanted to run away, but the desire was stronger than the fear. It even made the fear rather pleasurable.</p>
    <p>He was starting to climb over the pile of scrap when the android spoke. Its voice was light, clear, and carrying. There was nothing menacing about it. But it stopped Ciaran like a blow in the face, penetrating even through his semi-drugged yearning for the light.</p>
    <p>He knew sound. He knew mood. He was sensitive to them as his own harp in the way he made his living. He felt what was in that voice; or rather, what wasn't in it. And he stopped, dead still.</p>
    <p>It was a voice speaking out of a place where no emotion, as humanity knew the word, had ever existed. It came from a brain as alien and incomprehensible as darkness in a world of eternal light; a brain no human could ever touch or understand, except to feel the cold weight of its strength and cower as a beast cowers before the terrible mystery of fire.</p>
    <p>"Sleep," said the android. "Sleep, and listen to my voice. Open your minds, and listen."</p>

    <empty-line/>
    <p>Through a swimming rainbow haze Ciaran saw the relaxed, dull faces of the slaves.</p>
    <p>"You are nothing. You are no one. You exist only to serve; to work; to obey. Do you hear and understand?"</p>
    <p>The line of humans swayed and made a small moaning sigh. It held nothing but amazement and desire. They repeated the litany through thick animal mouths.</p>
    <p>"Your minds are open to mine. You will hear my thoughts. Once told, you will not forget. You will feel hunger and thirst, but not weariness. You will have no need to stop and rest, or sleep."</p>
    <p>Again the litany. Ciaran passed a hand over his face. He was sweating. In spite of himself the light and the soulless, mesmeric voice were getting him. He hit his own jaw with his knuckles, thanking whatever gods there were that the source of the light had been hidden from him. He knew he could never have bucked it.</p>
    <p>More, perhaps, of the power of the Stone of Destiny?</p>
    <p>A sudden sharp rattle of fragments brought his attention to the scrap heap. The hermit was already half way over it.</p>
    <p>And Mouse was right at his heels.</p>
    <p>Ciaran went after her. The rubble slipped and slid, and she was already out of reach. He called her name in desperation. She didn't hear him. She was hungry for the light.</p>
    <p>Ciaran flung himself bodily over the rubbish. Out on the floor, the nearest Kalds were shaking off their daze of worship. The hermit was scrambling on all fours, like a huge gray cat.</p>
    <p>Mouse's crimson tunic stayed just out of reach. Ciaran threw a handful of metal fragments at her back. She turned her head and snarled at him. She didn't see him. Almost as an automatic reflex she hurled some stuff at his face, but she didn't even slow down. The hermit cried out, a high, eerie scream.</p>
    <p>A huge hand closed on Ciaran's ankle and hauled him back. He fought it, jabbing with the wand he still carried. A second remorseless hand prisoned his wrist.</p>
    <p>The red hunter said dispassionately, "They come. We go."</p>
    <p>"Mouse! Let me go, damn you! Mouse!"</p>
    <p>"You can't help her. We go, quick."</p>
    <p>Ciaran went on kicking and thrashing.</p>
    <p>The hunter banged him over the ear with exquisite judgment, took the wand out of his limp hand and tossed him over one vast shoulder. The light hadn't affected the hunter much. He'd been in deeper shadow than the others, and his half-animal nerves had warned him quicker even than Ciaran's. Being a wise wild thing, he had shut his eyes at once.</p>
    <p>He doubled behind the metal sheds and began to run in dense shadow.</p>
    <p>Ciaran heard and felt things from a great misty distance. He heard the hermit yell again, a crazy votive cry of worship. He felt the painful jarring of his body and smelled the animal rankness of the hunter.</p>
    <p>He heard Mouse scream, just once.</p>
    <p>He tried to move; to get up and do something. The hunter slammed him hard across the kidneys. Ciaran was aware briefly that the lights were coming on again. After that it got very dark and very quiet.</p>
    <p>The hunter breathed in his ear, "Quiet! Don't move."</p>
    <p>There wasn't much chance of Ciaran doing anything. The hunter lay on top of him with one freckled paw covering most of his face. Ciaran gasped and rolled his eyes.</p>
    <p>They lay in a troughed niche of rough stone. There was black shadow on them from an overhang, but the blue glare burned beyond it. Even as he watched it dimmed and flickered and then steadied again.</p>
    <p>High up over his head the shining metal monster reached for the roof of the cavern. It had grown. It had grown enormously, and a mechanism was taking shape inside it; a maze of delicate rods and crystal prisms, of wheels and balances and things Ciaran hadn't any name for.</p>
    <p>Then he remembered about Mouse, and nothing else mattered.</p>
    <p>The hunter lay on him, crushing him to silence. Ciaran's blue eyes blazed. He'd have killed the hunter then, if there had been any way to do it. There wasn't. Presently he stopped fighting.</p>
    <p>Again the red giant breathed in his ear: "Look over the edge."</p>
    <p>He took his hand away. Very, very quietly, Ciaran raised his head a few inches and looked over.</p>
    <p>Their niche was some fifteen feet above the floor of the pit. Below and to the right was the mouth of a square tunnel. The crowded, sweating confusion of the forges and workshops spread out before them, with people swarming like ants after a rain.</p>
    <p>Standing at the tunnel mouth were two creatures in shining metal sheathes—the androids of Bas the Immortal.</p>
    <p>Their clear, light voices rose up to where Ciaran and the hunter lay.</p>
    <p>"Did you find out?"</p>
    <p>"Failing—as we judged. Otherwise, no change."</p>
    <p>"No change." One of the slim unhumans turned and looked with its depthless black eyes at the soaring metal giant. "If we can only finish it in time!"</p>
    <p>The other said, "We can, Khafre. We must."</p>
    <p>Khafre made a quick, impatient gesture. "We need more slaves! These human cattle are frail. You drive them, and they die."</p>
    <p>"The Kalds . . ."</p>
    <p>"Are doing what they can. Two more chains have just come. But it's still not enough to be safe! I've told the beasts to raid farther in, even to the border cities if they have to."</p>
    <p>"It won't help if the humans attack us before we're done."</p>
    <p>Khafre laughed. There was nothing pleasant or remotely humorous about it.</p>
    <p>"If they could track the Kalds this far, we could handle them easily. After we're finished, of course, they'll be subjugated anyway."</p>
    <p>The other nodded. Faintly uneasy, it said, "If we finish in time. If we don't . . ."</p>
    <p>"If we don't," said Khafre, "none of it matters, to them or us or the Immortal Bas." Something that might have been a shudder passed over its shining body. Then it threw back its head and laughed again, high and clear.</p>
    <p>"But we will finish it, Steud! We're unique in the universe, and nothing can stop us. This means the end of boredom, of servitude and imprisonment. With this world in our hands, nothing can stop us!"</p>
    <p>Steud whispered, "Nothing!" Then they moved away, disappearing into the seething clamor of the floor.</p>
    <p>The red hunter said, "What were they talking about?"</p>
    <p>Ciaran shook his head. His eyes were hard and curiously remote. "I don't know."</p>
    <p>"I don't like the smell of it, little man. It's bad."</p>
    <p>"Yeah." Ciaran's voice was very steady, "What happened to Mouse?"</p>
    <p>"She was taken with the others. Believe me, little man—I had to do what I did or they'd have taken you, too. There was nothing you could do to help her."</p>
    <p>"She—followed the light."</p>
    <p>"I think so. But I had to run fast."</p>
    <p>There was a mist over Ciaran's sight. His heart was slugging him. Not because he particularly cared, he asked, "How did we get away? I thought I saw the big lights come on . . ."</p>
    <p>"They did. And then they went off again, all of a sudden. They weren't expecting it. I had a head start. The gray beasts hunt by scent, but in that stewpot there are too many scents. They lost us, and when the lights came on again I saw this niche and managed to climb to it without being seen."</p>
    <p>He looked out over the floor, scratching his red beard. "I think they're too busy to bother about two people. No, three." He chuckled. "The hermit got away, too. He ran past me in the dark, screaming like an ape about revelations and The Light. Maybe they've got him again by now."</p>
    <p>Ciaran wasn't worrying about the hermit. "Subjugation," he said slowly. "With this world in their hands, nothing can stop them." He looked out across the floor of the pit. No guards. You didn't need any guards when you had a weapon like that light. Frail human cattle driven till they died, and not knowing about it nor caring.</p>
    <p>The world in their hands. An empty shell for them to play with, to use as they wanted. No more market places, no more taverns, no more songs. No more little people living their little lives the way they wanted to. Just slaves with blank faces, herded by gray beasts with shining wands and held by the android's light.</p>
    <p>He didn't know why the androids wanted the world or what they were going to do with it. He only knew that the whole thing made him sick—sick all through, in a way he'd never felt before.</p>
    <p>The fact that what he was going to do was hopeless and crazy never occurred to him. Nothing occurred to him, except that somewhere in that seething slave-pen Mouse was laboring, with eyes that didn't see and a brain that was only an open channel for orders. Pretty soon, like the woman up on the girder, she was going to hit her limit and die.</p>
    <p>Ciaran said abruptly, "If you want to kill a snake, what do you do?"</p>
    <p>"Cut off its head, of course."</p>
    <p>Ciaran got his feet under him. "The Stone of Destiny," he whispered. "The power of life and death. Do you believe in legends?"</p>
    <p>The hunter shrugged. "I believe in my hands. They're all I know."</p>
    <p>"I'm going to need your hands, to help me break one legend and build another!"</p>
    <p>"They're yours, little man. Where do we go?"</p>
    <p>"Down that tunnel. Because, if I'm not clear off, that leads to Ben Beatha, and Bas the Immortal—and the Stone."</p>
    <p>Almost as though it were a signal, the blue glare dimmed and flickered. In the semi-darkness Ciaran and the hunter dropped down from the niche and went into the tunnel.</p>
    <p>It was dark, with only a tiny spot of blue radiance at wide intervals along the walls. They had gone quite a distance before these strengthened to their normal brightness, and even then it was fairly dark. It seemed to be deserted.</p>
    <p>The hunter kept stopping to listen. When Ciaran asked irritably what was wrong, he said:</p>
    <p>"I think there's someone behind us. I'm not sure."</p>
    <p>"Well, give him a jab with the wand if he gets too close. Hurry up!"</p>
    <p>The tunnel led straight toward Ben Beatha, judging from its position in the pit. Ciaran was almost running when the hunter caught his shoulder urgently.</p>
    <p>"Wait! There's movement up ahead . . ."</p>
    <p>He motioned Ciaran down. On their hands and knees they crawled forward, holding their wands ready.</p>
    <p>A slight bend in the tunnel revealed a fork. One arm ran straight ahead. The other bent sharply upward, toward the surface.</p>
    <p>There were four Kalds crouched on the rock between them, playing some obscure game with human finger bones.</p>
    <p>Ciaran got his weight over his toes and moved fast. The hunter went beside him. Neither of them made a sound. The Kalds were intent on their game and not expecting trouble.</p>
    <p>The two men might have got away with it, only that suddenly from behind them, someone screamed like an angry cat.</p>
    <p>Ciaran's head jerked around, just long enough to let him see the hermit standing in the tunnel, with his stringy arms lifted and his gray hair flying, and a light of pure insanity blazing in his pale eyes.</p>
    <p>"Evil!" he shrieked. "You are evil to defy The Light, and the servants of The Light!"</p>
    <p>He seemed to have forgotten all about calling the Kalds demons a little while before.</p>
    <p>The gray beasts leaped up, moving quickly in with their wands ready. Ciaran yelled with sheer fury. He went for them, the rags of his yellow tunic streaming.</p>
    <p>He wasn't quite clear about what happened after that. There was a lot of motion, gray bodies leaping and twisting and jewel-tips flashing. Something flicked him stunningly across the temple. He fought in a sort of detached fog where everything was blurred and distant. The hermit went on screaming about Evil and The Light. The hunter bellowed a couple of times, things thudded and crashed, and once Ciaran poked his wand straight into a blood-pink eye.</p>
    <p>Sometime right after that there was a confused rush of running feet back in the tunnel. The hunter was down. And Ciaran found himself running up the incline, because the other way was suddenly choked with Kalds.</p>
    <p>He got away. He was never sure how. Probably instinct warned him to go in time so that in the confusion he was out of sight before the reinforcements saw him. Three of the original four Kalds were down and the fourth was busy with the hermit. Anyway, for the moment, he made it.</p>
    <p>When he staggered finally from the mouth of the ramp, drenched with sweat and gasping, he was back on the Forbidden Plains and Ben Beatha towered above him—a great golden Titan reaching for the red sky.</p>
    <p>The tumbled yellow rock of its steep slopes was barren of any growing thing. There were no signs of buildings, or anything built by hands, human or otherwise. High up, almost in the apex of the triangular peak, was a square, balconied opening that might have been only a wind-eroded niche in the cliff-face.</p>
    <p>Ciaran stood on widespread legs, studying the mountain with sullen stubborn eyes. He believed in legend, now. It was all he believed in. Somewhere under the golden peak was the Stone of Destiny and the demigod who was its master.</p>
    <p>Behind him were the creatures of that demigod, and the monster they were building—and a little black-haired Mouse who was going to die unless something was done about it.</p>
    <p>A lot of other people, too. A whole sane comfortable world. But Mouse was about all he could handle, just then.</p>
    <p>He wasn't Ciaran the bard any longer. He wasn't a human, attached to a normal human world. He moved in a strange land of gods and demons, where everything was as mad as a drunkard's nightmare, and Mouse was the only thing that held him at all to the memory of a life wherein men and women fought and laughed and loved.</p>
    <p>His scarred mouth twitched and tightened. He started off across the rolling, barren rise to Ben Beatha—a tough, bandy-legged little man in yellow rags, with a brown, expressionless face and a forgotten harp slung between his shoulders, moving at a steady gypsy lope.</p>
    <p>A wind sighed over the Forbidden Plains, rolling the sunballs in the red sky. And then, from the crest of Ben Beatha, the darkness came.</p>
    <p>This time Ciaran didn't stop to be afraid. There was nothing left inside him to be afraid with. He remembered the hermit's words: Judgment. Great things moving. Doom and destruction, a shadow across the world, a darkness and a dying. Something of the same feeling came to him, but he wasn't human any longer. He was beyond fear. Fate moved, and he was part of it.</p>
    <p>Stones and shale tricked his feet in the darkness. All across the Forbidden Plains there was night and a wailing wind and a sharp chill of cold. Far, far away there was a faint red glow on the sky where the sea burned with its own fire.</p>
    <p>Ciaran went on.</p>
    <p>Overhead, then, the sunballs began to flicker. Little striving ripples of light went out across them, lighting the barrens with an eerie witch-glow. The flickering was worse than the darkness. It was like the last struggling pulse of a dying man's heart. Ciaran was aware of a coldness in him beyond the chill of the wind.</p>
    <p>A shadow across the world, a darkness and a dying . . .</p>
    <p>He began to climb Ben Beatha.</p>

    <p>The stone was rough and fairly broken, and Ciaran had climbed mountains before. He crawled upward, through the sick light and the cold wind that screamed and fought him harder the higher he got. He retained no very clear memory of the climb. Only after a long, long time he fell inward over the wall of a balcony and lay still.</p>
    <p>He was bleeding from rock-tears and his heart kicked him like the heel of a vicious horse. But he didn't care. The balcony was man-made, the passage back of it led somewhere—and the light had come back in the sky.</p>
    <p>It wasn't quite the same, though. It was weaker, and less warm.</p>
    <p>When he could stand up he went in along the passage, square-hewn in the living rock of Ben Beatha, the Mountain of Life.</p>
    <p>It led straight in, lighted by a soft opaline glow from hidden light-sources. Presently it turned at right angles and became a spiral ramp, leading down.</p>
    <p>Corridors led back from it at various levels, but Ciaran didn't bother about them. They were dark, and the dust of ages lay unmarked on their floors.</p>
    <p>Down and down, a long, long way. Silence. The deep uncaring silence of death and the eternal rock—dark titans who watched the small furious ant-scurryings of man and never, never, for one moment, gave a damn.</p>
    <p>And then the ramp flattened into a broad high passage cut deep in the belly of the mountain. And the passage led to a door of gold, twelve feet high and intricately graved and pierced, set with symbols that Ciaran had heard of only in legend: the Hun-Lahun-Mehen, the Snake, the Circle, and the Cross, blazing in hot jewel-fires.</p>
    <p>But above them, crushing and dominant on both valves of the great door, was the crux ansata, the symbol of eternal life, cut from some lusterless stone so black it was like a pattern of blindness on the eyeball.</p>
    <p>Ciaran shivered and drew a deep, unsteady breath. One brief moment of human terror came to him. Then he set his two hands on the door and pushed it open.</p>
    <p>He came into a small room hung with tapestries and lighted dimly by the same opaline glow as the hallway. The half-seen pictures showed men and beasts and battles against a background at once tantalizingly familiar and frighteningly alien.</p>
    <p>There was a rug on the floor. It was made from the head and hide of a creature Ciaran had never even dreamed of before—a thing like a huge tawny cat with a dark mane and great, shining fangs.</p>
    <p>Ciaran padded softly across it and pushed aside the heavy curtains at the other end.</p>
    <p>At first there was only darkness. It seemed to fill a large space; Ciaran had an instinctive feeling of size. He went out into it, very cautiously, and then his eyes found a pale glow ahead in the blackness, as though someone had crushed a pearl with his thumb and smeared it across the dark.</p>
    <p>He was a thief and a gypsy. He made no more sound than a wisp of cloud, drifting toward it. His feet touched a broad, shallow step, and then another. He climbed, and the pearly glow grew stronger and became a curving wall of radiance.</p>
    <p>He stopped just short of touching it, on a level platform high above the floor. He squinted against its curdled, milky thickness, trying to see through.</p>
    <p>Wrapped in the light, cradled and protected by it like a bird in the heart of a shining cloud, a boy slept on a couch made soft with furs and colored silks. He was quite naked, his limbs flung out carelessly with the slim angular grace of his youth. His skin was white as milk, catching a pale warmth from the light.</p>
    <p>He slept deeply. He might almost have been dead, except for the slight rise and fall of his breathing. His head was rolled over so that he faced Ciaran, his cheek pillowed on his up flung arm.</p>
    <p>His hair, thick, curly, and black almost to blueness, had grown out long across his forearm, across the white fur beneath it, and down onto his wide slim shoulders. The nails of his lax hand, palm up above his head, stood up through the hair. They were inches long.</p>
    <p>His face was just a boy's face. A good face, even rather handsome, with strong bone just beginning to show under the roundness. His cheek was still soft as a girl's, the lashes of his closed lids dark and heavy.</p>
    <p>He looked peaceful, even happy. His mouth was curved in a vague smile, as though his dreams were pleasant. And yet there was something there . . .</p>
    <p>A shadow. Something unseen and untouchable, something as fragile as the note of a shepherd's pipe brought from far off on a vagrant breeze. Something as indescribable as death—and as broodingly powerful. Ciaran sensed it, and his nerves throbbed suddenly like the strings of his own harp.</p>
    <p>He saw then that the couch the boy slept on was a huge crux ansata, cut from the dead-black stone, with the arms stretching from under his shoulders and the loop like a monstrous halo above his head.</p>
    <p>The legends whispered through Ciaran's head. The songs, the tales, the folklore. The symbolism, and the image-patterns.</p>
    <p>Bas the Immortal was always described as a giant, like the mountain he lived in, and old, because Immortal suggests age. Awe, fear, and unbelief spoke through those legends, and the child-desire to build tall. But there was an older legend . . .</p>
    <p>Ciaran, because he was a gypsy and a thief and had music in him like a drunkard has wine, had heard it, deep in the black forests of Hyperborea where even gypsies seldom go. The oldest legend of all—the tale of the Shining Youth from Beyond, who walked in beauty and power, who never grew old, and who carried in his heart a bitter darkness that no man could understand.</p>
    <p>The Shining Youth from Beyond. A boy sleeping with a smile on his face, walled in living light.</p>
    <p>Ciaran stood still, staring. His face was loose and quite blank. His heartbeats shook him slightly, and his breath had a rusty sound in his open mouth.</p>
    <p>After a long time he started forward, into the light.</p>
    <p>It struck him, hurled him back numbed and dazed. Thinking of Mouse, he tried it twice more before he was convinced. Then he tried yelling. His voice crashed back at him from the unseen walls, but the sleeping boy never stirred, never altered even the rhythm of his breathing.</p>
    <p>After that Ciaran crouched in the awful laxness of impotency, and thought about Mouse, and cried.</p>
    <p>Then, quite suddenly, without any warning at all, the wall of light vanished.</p>
    <p>He didn't believe it. But he put his hand out again, and nothing stopped it, so he rushed forward in the pitch blackness until he hit the stone arm of the cross. And behind him, and all around him, the light began to glow again.</p>
    <p>Only now it was different. It flickered and dimmed and struggled, like something fighting not to die. Like something else . . .</p>
    <p>Like the sunballs. Like the light in the sky that meant life to a world. Flickering and feeble like an old man's heart, the last frightened wing-beats of a dying bird . . .</p>
    <p>A terror took Ciaran by the throat and stopped the breath in it, and turned his body colder than a corpse. He watched . . .</p>
    <p>The light glowed and pulsed, and grew stronger. Presently he was walled in by it, but it seemed fainter than before.</p>
    <p>A terrible feeling of urgency came over Ciaran, a need for haste. The words of the androids came back to him: Failing, as we judged. If we finish in time. If we don't, none of it matters.</p>
    <p>A shadow across the world, a darkness and a dying. Mouse slaving with empty eyes to build a shining monster that would harness the world to the wills of nonhuman brains.</p>
    <p>It didn't make sense, but it meant something. Something deadly important. And the key to the whole mad jumble was here—a dark-haired boy dreaming on a stone cross.</p>
    <p>Ciaran moved closer. He saw then that the boy had stirred, very slightly, and that his face was troubled. It was as though the dimming of the light had disturbed him. Then he sighed and smiled again, nestling his head deeper into the bend of his arm.</p>
    <p>"Bas," said Ciaran. "Lord Bas!"</p>
    <p>His voice sounded hoarse and queer. The boy didn't hear him. He called again, louder. Then he put his hand on one slim white shoulder and shook it hesitantly at first, and then hard, and harder.</p>
    <p>The boy Bas didn't even flicker his eyelids.</p>
    <p>Ciaran beat his fists against the empty air and cursed without any voice. Then, almost instinctively, he crouched on the stone platform and took his harp in his hands.</p>
    <p>It wasn't because he expected to do anything with it. It was simply that harping was as natural to him as breathing, and what was inside him had to come out some way. He wasn't thinking about music. He was thinking about Mouse, and it just added up to the same thing.</p>
    <p>Random chords at first, rippling up against the wall of milky light. Then the agony in him began to run out through his fingertips onto the strings, and he sent it thrumming strong across the still air. It sang wild and savage, but underneath it there was the sound of his own heart breaking, and the fall of tears.</p>
    <p>There was no time. There wasn't even any Ciaran. There was only the harp crying a dirge for a black-haired Mouse and the world she lived in. Nothing mattered but that. Nothing would ever matter.</p>
    <p>Then finally there wasn't anything left for the harp to cry about. The last quiver of the strings went throbbing off into a dull emptiness, and there was only an ugly little man in yellow rags crouched silent by a stone cross, hiding his face in his hands.</p>
    <p>Then, faint and distant, like the echo of words spoken in another world, another time:</p>
    <p>Don't draw the veil. Marsali—don't . . .</p>
    <p>Ciaran looked up, stiffening. The boy's lips moved. His face, the eyes still closed, was twisted in an agony of pleading. His hands were raised, reaching, trying to hold something that slipped through his fingers like mist.</p>
    <p>Dark mist. The mist of dreams. It was still in his eyes when he opened them. Gray eyes, clouded and veiled, and then with the dream-mist thickening into tears . . .</p>
    <p>He cried out, "Marsali!" as though his heart was ripped out of him with the breath that said it. Then he lay still on the couch, his eyes staring unfocused at the milky light, with the tears running out of them.</p>
    <p>Ciaran said softly, "Lord Bas . . ."</p>
    <p>"Awake," whispered the boy. "I'm awake again. Music—a harp crying out . . . I didn't want to wake! Oh, God, I didn't want to!"</p>
    <p>He sat up suddenly. The rage, the sheer blind fury in his young face rocked Ciaran like the blow of a fist.</p>
    <p>"Who waked me? Who dared to wake me?"</p>
    <p>There was no place to run. The light held him. And there was Mouse. Ciaran said:</p>
    <p>"I did, Lord Bas. There was need to."</p>
    <p>The boy's gray eyes came slowly to focus on his face. Ciaran's heart kicked once and stopped beating. A great cold stillness breathed from somewhere beyond the world and walled him in, closer and tighter than the milky light. Close and tight, like the packed earth of a grave.</p>
    <p>A boy's face, round and smooth and soft. No shadow even of down on the cheeks, the lips still pink and girlish. Long dark lashes, and under them . . .</p>
    <p>Gray eyes. Old with suffering, old with pain, old with an age beyond human understanding. Eyes that had seen birth and life and death in an endless stream, flowing by just out of reach, just beyond hearing. Eyes looking out between the bars of a private hell that was never built for any man before.</p>
    <p>One strong young hand reached down among the furs and silks and felt for something, and Ciaran knew the thing was death.</p>
    <p>Ciaran, suddenly, was furious himself.</p>
    <p>He struck a harsh, snarling chord on the harpstrings, thinking of Mouse. He poured his fury out in bitter, pungent words, the gypsy argot of the Quarters, and all the time Bas fumbled to get the hidden weapon in his hands.</p>
    <p>It was the long nails that saved Ciaran's life. They kept Bas from closing his fingers, and in the meantime some of Ciaran's vibrant rage had penetrated. Bas whispered:</p>
    <p>"You love a woman."</p>
    <p>"Yeah," said Ciaran. "Yeah."</p>
    <p>"So do I. A woman I created, and made to live in my dreams. Do you know what you did when you waked me?"</p>
    <p>"Maybe I saved the world. If the legends are right, you built it. You haven't any right to let it die so you can sleep."</p>
    <p>"I built another world, little man. Marsali's world. I don't want to leave it." He bent forward, toward Ciaran. "I was happy in that world. I built it to suit me. I belong in it. Do you know why? Because it's made from my own dreams, as I want it. Even the people. Even Marsali. Even myself.</p>
    <p>"They drove me away from one world. I built another, but it was no different. I'm not human. I don't belong with humans, nor in any world they live in. So I learned to sleep, and dream."</p>
    <p>He lay back on the couch. He looked pitifully young, with the long lashes hiding his eyes.</p>
    <p>"Go away. Let your little world crumble. It's doomed anyway. What difference do a few life-spans make in eternity? Let me sleep."</p>
    <p>Ciaran struck the harp again. "No! Listen . . ."</p>
    <p>He told Bas about the slave gangs, the androids, the shining monster in the pit—and the darkness that swept over the world. It was the last that caught the boy's attention.</p>
    <p>He sat up slowly. "Darkness? You! How did you get to me, past the light?"</p>
    <p>Ciaran told him.</p>
    <p>"The Stone of Destiny," whispered the Immortal. Suddenly he laughed. He laughed to fill the whole dark space beyond the light; terrible laughter, full of hate and a queer perverted triumph.</p>
    <p>He stopped, as suddenly as he had begun, and spread his hands flat on the colored silks, the long nails gleaming like knives. His eyes widened, gray windows into a deep hell, and his voice was no more than a breath.</p>
    <p>"Could that mean that I will die, too?"</p>
    <p>Ciaran's scarred mouth twitched. "The Stone of Destiny . . ."</p>
    <p>The boy leaped up from his couch. His hand swept over some hidden control in the arm of the stone cross, and the milky light died out. At the same time, an opaline glow suffused the darkness beyond.</p>
    <p>Bas the Immortal ran down the steps—a dark-haired, graceful boy running naked in the heart of an opal.</p>
    <p>Ciaran followed.</p>
    <p>They came to the hollow core of Ben Beatha—a vast pyramidal space cut in the yellow rock. Bas stopped, and Ciaran stopped behind him.</p>
    <p>The whole space was laced and twined and webbed with crystal. Rods of it, screens of it, meshes of it. A shining helix ran straight up overhead, into a shaft that seemed to go clear through to open air.</p>
    <p>In the crystal, pulsing along it like the life-blood in a man's veins, there was light.</p>
    <p>It was like no light Ciaran had ever seen before. It was no color, and every color. It seared the eye with heat, and yet it was cold and pure like still water. It throbbed and beat. It was alive.</p>
    <p>Ciaran followed the crystal maze down and down, to the base of it. There, in the very heart of it, lying at the hub of a shining web, lay something.</p>
    <p>Like a black hand slammed across the eyeballs, darkness fell.</p>
    <p>For a moment he was blind, and through the blindness came a soft whisper of movement. Then there was light again; a vague smeared spot of it on the pitch black.</p>
    <p>It glowed and faded and glowed again. The rusty gleam slid across the half-crouched body of Bas the Immortal, pressed close against the crystal web. It caught in his eyes, turning them hot and lambent like beast-eyes in the dark of a cave-mouth.</p>
    <p>Little sparks of hell-fire in a boy's face, staring at the Stone of Destiny.</p>
    <p>A stone no bigger than a man's heart, with power in it. Even dying, it had power. Power to build a world, or smash it. Power never born of Ciaran's planet, or any planet, but something naked and perfect—an egg from the womb of space itself.</p>
    <p>It fought to live, lying in its crystal web. It was like watching somebody's heart stripped clean and struggling to beat. The fire in it flickered and flared, sending pale witch-lights dancing up along the crystal maze.</p>
    <p>Outside, Ciaran knew, all across the world, the sunballs were pulsing and flickering to the dying beat of the Stone.</p>
    <p>Bas whispered, "It's over. Over and done."</p>
    <p>Without knowing it, Ciaran touched the harpstrings and made them shudder. "The legends were right, then. The Stone of Destiny kept the world alive."</p>
    <p>"Alive. It gave light and warmth, and before that it powered the ship that brought me here across space, from the third planet of our sun to the tenth. It sealed the gaps in the planet's crust and drove the machinery that filled the hollow core inside with air. It was my strength. It built my world; my world, where I would be loved and respected—all right, and worshipped!"</p>
    <p>He laughed, a small bitter sob.</p>
    <p>"A child I was. After all those centuries, still a child playing with a toy."</p>
    <p>His voice rang out louder across the flickering dimness. A boy's voice, clear and sweet. He wasn't talking to Ciaran. He wasn't even talking to himself. He was talking to Fate, and cursing it.</p>
    <p>"I took a walk one morning. That was all I did. I was just a fisherman's son walking on the green hills of Atlantis above the sea. That was all I wanted to be—a fisherman's son, someday to be a fisherman myself, with sons of my own. And then from nowhere, out of the sky, the meteorite fell. There was thunder, and a great light, and then darkness. And when I woke again I was a god.</p>
    <p>"I took the Stone of Destiny out of its broken shell. The light from it burned in me, and I was a god. And I was happy. I didn't know.</p>
    <p>"I was too young to be a god. A boy who never grew older. A boy who wanted to play with other boys, and couldn't. A boy who wanted to age, to grow a beard and a man's voice, and find a woman to love. It was hell, after the thrill wore off. It was worse, when my mind and heart grew up, and my body didn't.</p>
    <p>"And they said I was no god, but a blasphemy, a freak.</p>
    <p>"The priests of Dagon, of all the temples of Atlantis, spoke against me. I had to run away. I roamed the whole earth before the Flood, carrying the Stone. Sometimes I ruled for centuries, a god-king, but always the people tired of me and rose against me. They hated me, because I lived forever and never grew old.</p>
    <p>"A man they might have accepted. But a boy! A brain with all the wisdom it could borrow from time, grown so far from theirs that it was hard to talk to them—and a body too young even for the games of manhood!"</p>
    <p>Ciaran stood frozen, shrinking from the hell in the boy-god's agonized voice.</p>
    <p>"So I grew to hate them, and when they drove me out I turned on them, and used the power of the Stone to destroy. I know what happened to the cities of the Gobi, to Angkor, and the temples of Mayapan! So the people hated me more because they feared me more, and I was alone. No one has ever been alone as I was.</p>
    <p>"So I built my own world, here in the heart of a dead planet. And in the end it was the same, because the people were human and I was not. I created the androids, freaks like myself, to stand between me and my people—my own creatures, that I could trust. And I built a third world, in my dreams.</p>
    <p>"And now the Stone of Destiny has come to the end of its strength. Its atoms are eaten away by its own fire. The world it powered will die. And what will happen to me? Will I go on living, even after my body is frozen in the cold dark?"</p>
    <p>Silence, then. The pulsing beat of light in the crystal rods. The heart of a world on its deathbed.</p>
    <p>Ciaran's harp crashed out. It made the crystal sing. His voice came with it:</p>
    <p>"Bas! The monster in the pit, that the androids are building—I know now what it is! They knew the Stone was dying. They're going to have power of their own, and take the world. You can't let them, Bas! You brought us here. We're your people. You can't let the androids have us!"</p>
    <p>The boy laughed, a low, bitter sound. "What do I care for your world or your people? I only want to sleep." He caught his breath in and turned around, as though he was going back to the place of the stone cross.</p>

    <empty-line/>
    <p>Ciaran stroked the harpstrings. "Wait . . ." It was all humanity crying out of the harp. Little people, lost and frightened and pleading for help. No voice could have said what it said. It was Ciaran himself, a channel for the unthinking pain inside him.</p>
    <p>"Wait—You were human once. You were young. You laughed and quarreled and ate and slept, and you were free. That's all we ask. Just those things. Remember Bas the fisherman's son, and help us!"</p>
    <p>Gray eyes looking at him. Gray eyes looking from a boy's face. "How could I help you even if I wanted to?"</p>
    <p>"There's some power left in the Stone. And the androids are your creatures. You made them. You can destroy them. If you could do it before they finish this thing—from the way they spoke, they mean to destroy you with it."</p>
    <p>Bas laughed.</p>
    <p>Ciaran's hand struck a terrible chord from the harp, and fell away.</p>
    <p>Bas said heavily, "They'll draw power from the gravitic force of the planet and broadcast it the same way. It will never stop as long as the planet spins. If they finish it in time, the world will live. If they don't . . ." He shrugged. "What difference does it make?"</p>
    <p>"So," whispered Ciaran, "we have a choice of a quick death, or a lingering one. We can die free, on our own feet, or we can die slaves." His voice rose to a full-throated shout. "God! You're no god! You're a selfish brat sulking in a corner. All right, go back to your Marsali! And I'll play god for a minute."</p>
    <p>He raised the harp.</p>
    <p>"I'll play god, and give 'em the clean way out!"</p>
    <p>He drew his arm back to throw—to smash the crystal web. And then, with blinding suddenness, there was light again.</p>
    <p>They stood frozen, the two of them, blinking in the hot opalescence. Then their eyes were drawn to the crystal web.</p>
    <p>The Stone of Destiny still fluttered like a dying heart, and the crystal rods were dim.</p>
    <p>Ciaran whispered, "It's too late. They're finished."</p>
    <p>Silence again. They stood almost as though they were waiting for something, hardly breathing, with Ciaran still holding the silent harp in his hand.</p>
    <p>Very, very faintly, under his fingers, the strings began to thrum.</p>
    <p>Vibration. In a minute Ciaran could hear it in the crystal. It was like the buzz and strum of insects just out of earshot. He said:</p>
    <p>"What's that?"</p>
    <p>The boy's ears were duller than his. But presently he smiled and said, "So that's how they're going to do it. Vibration, that will shake Ben Beatha into a cloud of dust, and me with it. They must believe I'm still asleep." He shrugged. "What matter? It's death."</p>
    <p>Ciaran slung the harp across his back. There was a curious finality in the action.</p>
    <p>"There's a way from here into the pit. Where is it?"</p>
    <p>Bas pointed across the open space. Ciaran started walking. He didn't say anything.</p>
    <p>Bas said, "Where are you going?"</p>
    <p>"Back to Mouse," said Ciaran simply.</p>
    <p>"To die with her." The crystal maze hummed eerily. "I wish I could see Marsali again."</p>
    <p>Ciaran stopped. He spoke over his shoulder, without expression. "The death of the Stone doesn't mean your death, does it?"</p>
    <p>"No. The first exposure to its light when it landed, blazing with the heat of friction, made permanent changes in the cell structure of my body. I'm independent of it—as the androids are of the culture vats they grew in."</p>
    <p>"And the new power source will take up where the Stone left off?"</p>
    <p>"Yes. Even the wall of rays that protected me and fed my body while I slept will go on. The power of the Stone was broadcast to it, and to the sunballs. There were no mechanical leads."</p>
    <p>Ciaran said softly, "And you love this Marsali? You're happy in this dream world you created? You could go back there?"</p>
    <p>"Yes," whispered Bas. "Yes. Yes!"</p>
    <p>Ciaran turned. "Then help us destroy the androids. Give us our world, and we'll give you yours. If we fail—well, we have nothing to lose."</p>
    <p>Silence. The crystal web hummed and sang—death whispering across the world. The Stone of Destiny throbbed like the breast of a dying bird. The boy's gray eyes were veiled and remote. It seemed almost that he was asleep.</p>
    <p>Then he smiled—the drowsy smile of pleasure he had worn when Ciaran found him, dreaming on the stone cross.</p>
    <p>"Marsali," he whispered. "Marsali."</p>
    <p>He moved forward then, reaching out across the crystal web. The long nails on his fingers scooped up the Stone of Destiny, cradled it, caged it in.</p>
    <p>Bas the Immortal said, "Let's go, little man."</p>
    <p>Ciaran didn't say anything. He looked at Bas. His eyes were wet. Then he got the harp in his hands again and struck it, and the thundering chords shook the crystal maze to answering music.</p>
    <p>It drowned the faint death-whisper. And then, caught between two vibrations, the shining rods split and fell, with a shiver of sound like the ringing of distant bells.</p>
    <p>Ciaran turned and went down the passage to the pit. Behind him came the dark-haired boy with the Stone of Destiny in his hands.</p>
    <p>They came along the lower arm of the fork where Ciaran and the hunter had fought the Kalds. There were four of the gray beasts still on guard.</p>
    <p>Ciaran had pulled the wand from his girdle. The Kalds started up, and Ciaran got ready to fight them. But Bas said, "Wait."</p>
    <p>He stepped forward. The Kalds watched him with their blood-pink eyes, yawning and whimpering with animal nervousness. The boy's dark gaze burned. The gray brutes cringed and shivered and then dropped flat, hiding their faces against the stone.</p>
    <p>"Telepaths," said Bas to Ciaran, "and obedient to the strongest mind. The androids know that. The Kalds weren't put there to stop me physically, but to send the androids warning if I came."</p>
    <p>Ciaran shivered. "So they'll be waiting."</p>
    <p>"Yes, little man. They'll be waiting."</p>
    <p>They went down the long tunnel and stepped out on the floor of the pit.</p>
    <p>It was curiously silent. The fires had died in the forges. There was no sound of hammering, no motion. Only blazing lights and a great stillness, like someone holding his breath. There was no one in sight.</p>
    <p>The metal monster climbed up the pit. It was finished now. The intricate maze of grids and balances in its belly murmured with the strength that spun up through it from the core of the planet. It was like a vast spider, making an invisible thread of power to wrap around the world and hold it, to be sucked dry.</p>
    <p>An army of Kalds began to move on silent feet, out from the screening tangle of sheds and machinery.</p>
    <p>The androids weren't serious about that. It was just a skirmish, a test to see whether Bas had been weakened by his age-long sleep. He hadn't been. The Kalds looked at the Stone of Destiny and from there to Bas's gray eyes, cringed, whimpered, and lay flat.</p>
    <p>Bas whispered, "Their minds are closed to me, but I can feel—the androids are working, preparing some trap . . ."</p>
    <p>His eyes were closed now, his young face set with concentration. "They don't want me to see, but my mind is older than theirs, and better trained, and I have the power of the Stone. I can see a control panel. It directs the force of their machine . . ."</p>
    <p>He began to move, then, rapidly, out across the floor. His eyes were still closed. It seemed he didn't need them for seeing.</p>
    <p>People began to come out from behind the sheds and the cooling forges. Blank-faced people with empty eyes. Many of them, making a wall of themselves against Bas.</p>
    <p>Ciaran cried out, "Mouse . . . !"</p>
    <p>She was there. Her body was there, thin and erect in the crimson tunic. Her black hair was still wild around her small brown face. But Mouse, the Mouse that Ciaran knew, was dead behind her dull black eyes. Ciaran whispered, "Mouse . . ."</p>
    <p>The slaves flowed in and held the two of them, clogged in a mass of unresponsive bodies.</p>
    <p>"Can't you free them, Bas?"</p>
    <p>"Not yet. Not now. There isn't time."</p>
    <p>"Can't you do with them what you did with the Kalds?"</p>
    <p>"The androids control their minds through hypnosis. If I fought that control, the struggle would blast their minds to death or idiocy. And there isn't time . . ." There was sweat on his smooth young forehead. "I've got to get through. I don't want to kill them . . ."</p>
    <p>Ciaran looked at Mouse. "No," he said hoarsely.</p>
    <p>"But I may have to, unless . . . Wait! I can channel the power of the Stone through my own brain, because there's an affinity between us. Vibration, cell to cell. The androids won't have made a definite command against music. Perhaps I can jar their minds open, just enough, so that you can call them with your harp, as you called me."</p>
    <p>A tremor almost of pain ran through the boy's body.</p>
    <p>"Lead them away, Ciaran. Lead them as far as you can. Otherwise many of them will die. And hurry!"</p>
    <p>Bas raised the Stone of Destiny in his clasped hands and pressed it to his forehead. And Ciaran took his harp.</p>
    <p>He was looking at Mouse when he set the strings to singing. That was why it wasn't hard to play as he did. It was something from him to Mouse. A prayer. A promise. His heart held out on a song.</p>
    <p>The music rippled out across the packed mass of humanity. At first they didn't hear it. Then there was a stirring and a sigh, a dumb, blind reaching. Somewhere the message was getting through the darkness clouding their minds. A message of hope. A memory of red sunlight on green hills, of laughter and home and love.</p>
    <p>Ciaran let the music die to a whisper under his fingers, and the people moved forward, toward him, wanting to hear.</p>
    <p>He began to walk away, slowly, trailing the harp-song over his shoulder—and they followed. Haltingly, in twos and threes, until the whole mass broke and flowed like water in his wake.</p>
    <p>Bas was gone, his slim young body slipping fast through the broken ranks of the crowd.</p>
    <p>Ciaran caught one more glimpse of Mouse before he lost her among the others. She was crying, without knowing or remembering why.</p>
    <p>If Bas died, if Bas was defeated, she would never know nor remember.</p>
    <p>Ciaran led them as far as he could, clear to the wall of the pit. He stopped playing. They stopped, too, standing like cattle, looking at nothing, with eyes turned inward to their clouded dreams.</p>
    <p>Ciaran left them there, running out alone across the empty floor.</p>
    <p>He followed the direction Bas had taken. He ran, fast, but it was like a nightmare where you run and run and never get anywhere. The lights glared down and the metal monster sighed and churned high up over his head, and there was no other sound, no other movement but his own.</p>
    <p>Then, abruptly, the lights went out.</p>
    <p>He stumbled on, hitting brutally against unseen pillars, falling and scrambling in scrap heaps. And after an eternity he saw light again, up ahead.</p>
    <p>The Light he had seen before, here in the pit. The glorious opalescent light that drew a man's mind and held it fast to be chained.</p>
    <p>Ciaran crept in closer.</p>
    <p>There was a control panel on a stone dais—a meaningless jumbled mass of dials and wires. The androids stood before it. One of them was bent over, its yellowish hands working delicately with the controls. The other stood erect beside it, holding a staff. The metal ball at the top was open, spilling the opalescent blaze into the darkness.</p>
    <p>Ciaran crouched in the shelter of a pillar, shielding his eyes. Even now he wanted to walk into that light and be its slave.</p>
    <p>The android with the staff said harshly, "Can't you find the wave length? He should have been dead by now."</p>
    <p>The bending one tensed and then straightened, the burning light sparkling across its metal sheath. Its eyes were black and limitless, like evil itself, and no more human.</p>
    <p>"Yes," it said. "I have it."</p>
    <p>The light began to burst stronger from the staff, a swirling dangerous fury of it.</p>
    <p>Ciaran was hardly breathing. The light-source, whatever it was, was part of the power of the Stone of Destiny. Wave lengths meant nothing to him, but it seemed the danger was to the Stone—and Bas carried it.</p>
    <p>The android touched the staff. The light died, clipped off as the metal ball closed.</p>
    <p>"If there's any power left in the Stone," it whispered, "our power-wave will blast its subatomic reserve—and Bas the Immortal with it!"</p>
    <p>Silence. And then in the pitch darkness a coal began to glow.</p>
    <p>It came closer. It grew brighter, and a smudged reflection behind and above it became the head and shoulders of Bas the Immortal.</p>
    <p>The android whispered, "Stronger! Hurry!"</p>
    <p>A yellowish hand made a quick adjustment. The Stone of Destiny burned brighter. It burst with light. It was like a sunball, stabbing its hot fury into the darkness.</p>
    <p>The android whispered, "More!"</p>
    <p>The Stone filled all the pit with a deadly blaze of glory.</p>
    <p>Bas stopped, looking up at the dais. He grinned. A naked boy, beautiful with youth, his gray eyes veiled and sleepy under dark lashes.</p>
    <p>He threw the Stone of Destiny up on the dais. An idle boy tossing stones at a treetop.</p>
    <p>Light. An explosion of it, without sound, without physical force. Ciaran dropped flat on his face behind the pillar. After a long time he raised his head again. The overhead lights were on, and Bas stood on the dais beside two twisted, shining lumps of man-made soulless men.</p>
    <p>The android flesh had taken the radiation as leather takes heat, warping, twisting, turning black.</p>
    <p>"Poor freaks," said Bas softly. "They were like me, with no place in the universe that belonged to them. So they dreamed, too—only their dreams were evil."</p>
    <p>He stooped and picked up something—a dull, dark stone, a thing with no more life nor light than a waterworn pebble.</p>
    <p>He sighed and rolled it once between his palms, and let it drop.</p>
    <p>"If they had had time to learn their new machine a little better, I would never have lived to reach them in time." He glanced down at Ciaran, standing uncertainly below. "Thanks to you, little man, they didn't have quite time enough."</p>
    <p>He gestured to a staff. "Bring it, and I'll free your Mouse."</p>

    <p>A long time afterward Mouse and Ciaran and Bas the Immortal stood in the opal-tinted glow of the great room of the crux ansata. Outside the world was normal again, and safe. Bas had left full instructions about controlling and tending the centrifugal power plant.</p>
    <p>The slaves were freed, going home across the Forbidden Plains-forbidden no longer. The Kalds were sleeping, mercifully; the big sleep from which they would never wake. The world was free, for humanity to make or mar on its own responsibility.</p>
    <p>Mouse stood very close to Ciaran, her arm around his waist, his around her shoulders. Crimson rags mingling with yellow; fair shaggy hair mixing with black. Bas smiled at them.</p>
    <p>"Now," he said, "I can be happy, until the planet itself is dead."</p>
    <p>"You won't stay with us? Our gratitude, our love . . . ."</p>
    <p>"Will be gone with the coming generations. No, little man. I built myself a world where I belong—the only world where I can ever belong. And I'll be happier in it than any of you, because it is my world—free of strife and ugliness and suffering. A beautiful world, for me and Marsali."</p>
    <p>There was a radiance about him that Ciaran would put into a song some day, only half understanding.</p>
    <p>"I don't envy you," whispered Bas, and smiled. Youth smiling in a spring dawn. "Think of us sometimes, and be jealous."</p>
    <p>He turned and walked away, going lightly over the wide stone floor and up the steps to the dais, Ciaran struck the harpstrings. He sent the music flooding up against the high vault, filling all the rocky space with a thrumming melody.</p>
    <p>He sang. The tune he had sung for Mouse, on the ridge above the burning sea. A simple tune, about two people in love.</p>
    <p>Bas lay down on the couch of furs and colored silks, soft on the shaft of the stone cross. He looked back at them once, smiling. One slim white arm raised in a brief salute and swept down across the black stone.</p>
    <p>The milky light rose on the platform. It wavered, curdled, and thickened to a wall of warm pearl. Through it, for a moment, they could see him, his dark head pillowed on his forearm, his body sprawled in careless, angular grace. Then there was only the warm, soft shell of light.</p>
    <p>Ciaran's harp whispered to silence. The tunnel into the pit was sealed. Mouse and Ciaran went out through the golden doors and closed them, very quietly—doors that would never be opened again as long as the world lived.</p>
    <p>Then they came into each other's arms, and kissed.</p>
    <p>Rough, tight arms on living flesh, lips that bruised and breaths that mingled, hot with life. Temper and passion, empty bellies, a harp that sang in crowded market squares, and no roof to fight under but the open sky.</p>
    <p>And Ciaran didn't envy the dark-haired boy, dreaming on the stone cross.</p>

    <p>THE VANISHING VENUSIANS</p>

    <p>The breeze was steady enough, but it was not in a hurry. It filled the lug sail just hard enough to push the dirty weed-grown hull through the water, and no harder. Matt Harker lay alongside the tiller and counted the trickles of sweat crawling over his nakedness, and stared with sullen, opaque eyes into the indigo night. Anger, leashed and impotent, rose in his throat like bitter vomit.</p>
    <p>The sea—Rory McLaren's Venusian wife called it the Sea of Morning Opals—lay unstirring, black, streaked with phosphorescence. The sky hung low over it, the thick cloud blanket of Venus that had made the Sun a half-remembered legend to the exiles from Earth. Riding lights burned in the blue gloom, strung out in line. Twelve ships, thirty-eight hundred people, going no place, trapped in the interval between birth and death and not knowing what to do about it.</p>
    <p>Matt Harker glanced upward at the sail and then at the stern lantern of the ship ahead. His face, in the dim glow that lights Venus even at night, was a gaunt oblong of shadows and hard bone, seamed and scarred with living, with wanting and not having, with dying and not being dead. He was a lean man, wiry and not tall, with a snake-like surety of motion.</p>
    <p>Somebody came scrambling quietly aft along the deck, avoiding the sleeping bodies crowded everywhere. Harker said, without emotion, "Hi, Rory."</p>
    <p>Rory McLaren said, "Hi, Matt." He sat down. He was young, perhaps half Harker's age. There was still hope in his face, but it was growing tired. He sat for a while without speaking, looking at nothing, and then said, "Honest to God, Matt, how much longer can we last?"</p>
    <p>"What's the matter, kid? Starting to crack?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know. Maybe. When are we going to stop somewhere?"</p>
    <p>"When we find a place to stop."</p>
    <p>"Is there a place to stop? Seems like ever since I was born we've been hunting. There's always something wrong. Hostile natives, or fever, or bad soil, always something, and we go on again. It's not right. It's not any way to try to live."</p>
    <p>Harker said, "I told you not to go having kids."</p>
    <p>"What's that got to do with it?"</p>
    <p>"You start worrying. The kid isn't even here yet, and already you're worrying."</p>
    <p>"Sure I am." McLaren put his head in his hands suddenly and swore. Harker knew he did that to keep from crying. "I'm worried," McLaren said, "that maybe the same thing'll happen to my wife and kid that happened to yours. We got fever aboard."</p>
    <p>Harker's eyes were like blown coals for an instant. Then he glanced up at the sail and said, "They'd be better off if it didn't live."</p>
    <p>"That's no kind of a thing to say."</p>
    <p>"It's the truth. Like you asked me, when are we going to stop somewhere? Maybe never. You bellyache about it ever since you were born. Well, I've been at it longer than that. Before you were born I saw our first settlement burned by the Cloud People, and my mother and father crucified in their own vineyard. I was there when this trek to the Promised Land began, back on Earth, and I'm still waiting for the promise."</p>
    <p>The sinews in Harker's face were drawn like knots of wire. His voice had a terrible quietness.</p>
    <p>"Your wife and kid would be better off to die now, while Viki's still young and has hope, and before the child ever opens its eyes."</p>
    <p>Sim, the big black man, relieved Harker before dawn. He started singing, softly—something mournful and slow as the breeze, and beautiful. Harker cursed him and went up into the bow to sleep, but the song stayed with him. Oh, I looked over Jordan, and what did I see, comin' for to carry me home . . . .</p>
    <p>Harker slept. Presently he began to moan and twitch, and then cry out. People around him woke up. They watched with interest. Harker was a lone wolf awake, ill-tempered and violent. When, at long intervals, he would have one of his spells, no one was anxious to help him out of it. They liked peeping inside of Harker when he wasn't looking.</p>
    <p>Harker didn't care. He was playing in the snow again. He was seven years old, and the drifts were high and white, and above them the sky was so blue and clean that he wondered if God mopped it every few days like Mom did the kitchen floor. The sun was shining. It was like a great gold coin, and it made the snow burn like crushed diamonds. He put his arms up to the sun, and the cold air slapped him with clean hands, and he laughed. And then it was all gone . . . .</p>
    <p>"By gawd." somebody said. "Ain't them tears on his face?"</p>
    <p>"Bawling. Bawling like a little kid. Listen at him."</p>
    <p>"Hey," said the first one sheepishly. "Reckon we oughta wake him up?"</p>
    <p>"Hell with him, the old sour-puss. Hey, listen to that . . . !"</p>
    <p>"Dad," Harker whispered. "Dad, I want to go home."</p>
    <p>The dawn came like a sifting of fire-opals through the layers of pearl-gray cloud. Harker heard the yelling dimly in his sleep. He felt dull and tired, and his eyelids stuck together. The yelling gradually took shape and became the word "Land!" repeated over and over. Harker kicked himself awake and got up.</p>
    <p>The tideless sea glimmered with opaline colors under the mist. Flocks of little jewel-scaled sea-dragons rose up from the ever-present floating islands of weed, and the weed itself, part of it, writhed and stretched with sentient life.</p>
    <p>Ahead there was a long low hummock of muddy ground fading into tangled swamp. Beyond it, rising sheer into the clouds, was a granite cliff, a sweeping escarpment that stood like a wall against the hopeful gaze of the exiles.</p>
    <p>Harker found Rory McLaren standing beside him, his arm around Viki, his wife. Viki was one of several Venusians who had married into the Earth colony. Her skin was clear white, her hair a glowing silver, her lips vividly red. Her eyes were like the sea, changeable, full of hidden life. Just now they had that special look that the eyes of women get when they're thinking about creation. Harker looked away.</p>
    <p>McLaren said, "It's land."</p>
    <p>Harker said, "It's mud. It's swamp. It's fever. It's like the rest."</p>
    <p>Viki said, "Can we stop here, just a little while?"</p>
    <p>Harker shrugged. "That's up to Gibbons." He wanted to ask what the hell difference it made where the kid was born, but for once he held his tongue. He turned away. Somewhere in the waist a woman was screaming in delirium. There were three shapes wrapped in ragged blankets and laid on planks by the port scuppers. Harker's mouth twitched in a crooked smile.</p>
    <p>"We'll probably stop long enough to bury them," he said. "Maybe that'll be time enough."</p>
    <p>He caught a glimpse of McLaren's face. The hope in it was not tired any more. It was dead. Dead, like the rest of Venus.</p>
    <p>Gibbons called the chief men together aboard his ship—the leaders, the fighters and hunters and seamen, the tough leathery men who were the armor around the soft body of the colony. Harker was there, and McLaren. McLaren was young, but up until lately he had had a quality of optimism that cheered his shipmates, a natural leadership.</p>
    <p>Gibbons was an old man. He was the original guiding spirit of the five thousand colonists who had come out from Earth to a new start on a new world. Time and tragedy, disappointment and betrayal had marked him cruelly, but his head was still high. Harker admired his guts while cursing him for an idealistic fool.</p>
    <p>The inevitable discussion started as to whether they should try a permanent settlement on this mud flat or go on wandering over the endless, chartless seas. Harker said impatiently:</p>
    <p>"For cripesake, look at the place. Remember the last time. Remember the time before that, and stop bleating."</p>
    <p>Sim, the big black, said quietly, "The people are getting awful tired. A man was meant to have roots some place. There's going to be trouble pretty soon if we don't find land."</p>
    <p>Harker said, "You think you can find some, pal, go to it."</p>
    <p>Gibbons said heavily, "But he's right. There's hysteria, fever, dysentery and boredom, and the boredom's worst of all."</p>
    <p>McLaren said, "I vote to settle."</p>
    <p>Harker laughed. He was leaning by the cabin port, looking out at the cliffs. The gray granite looked clean above the swamp. Harker tried to pierce the clouds that hid the top, but couldn't. His dark eyes narrowed. The heated voices behind him faded into distance. Suddenly he turned and said, "Sir, I'd like permission to see what's at the top of those cliffs."</p>
    <p>There was complete silence. Then Gibbons said slowly, "We've lost too many men on journeys like that before, only to find the plateau uninhabitable."</p>
    <p>"There's always the chance. Our first settlement was in the high plateaus, remember. Clean air, good soil, no fever."</p>
    <p>"I remember," Gibbons said. "I remember." He was silent for a while, then he gave Harker a shrewd glance. "I know you, Matt. I might as well give permission."</p>
    <p>Harker grinned. "You won't miss me much anyhow. I'm not a good influence anymore." He started for the door. "Give me three weeks. You'll take that long to careen and scrape the bottoms anyhow. Maybe I'll come back with something."</p>
    <p>McLaren said, "I'm going with you, Matt."</p>
    <p>Harker gave him a level-eyed stare. "You better stay with Vila."</p>
    <p>"If there's good land up there, and anything happens to you so you can't come back and tell us . . . ."</p>
    <p>"Like not bothering to come back, maybe?"</p>
    <p>"I didn't say that. Like we both won't come back. But two is better than one."</p>
    <p>Harker smiled. The smile was enigmatic and not very nice. Gibbons said, "He's right, Matt." Harker shrugged. Then Sim stood up.</p>
    <p>"Two is good," he said, "but three is better." He turned to Gibbons. "There's nearly five hundred of us, sir. If there's new land up there, we ought to share the burden of finding it."</p>
    <p>Gibbons nodded. Harker said, "You're crazy, Sim. Why you want to do all that climbing, maybe to no place?"</p>
    <p>Sim smiled. His teeth were unbelievably white in the sweat-polished blackness of his face. "But that's what my people always done, Matt. A lot of climbing, to no place."</p>
    <p>They made their preparations and had a last night's sleep. McLaren said goodbye to Viki. She didn't cry. She knew why he was going. She kissed him, and all she said was, "Be careful." All he said was, "I'll be back before he's born."</p>
    <p>They started at dawn, carrying dried fish and sea-berries made into pemmican, and their long knives and ropes for climbing. They had long ago run out of ammunition for their few blasters, and they had no equipment for making more. All were adept at throwing spears, and carried three short ones barbed with bone across their backs.</p>
    <p>It was raining when they crossed the mud flat, wading thigh-deep in heavy mist. Harker led the way through the belt of swamp. He was an old hand at it, with an uncanny quickness in spotting vegetation that was as independently alive and hungry as he was. Venus is one vast hothouse, and the plants have developed into species as varied and marvelous as the reptiles or the mammals, crawling out of the pre-Cambrian seas as primitive flagellates and growing wills of their own, with appetites and motive power to match. The children of the colony learned at an early age not to pick flowers. The blossoms too often bit back.</p>
    <p>The swamp was narrow, and they came out of it safely. A great swamp-dragon, a leshen, screamed not far off, but they hunt by night, and it was too sleepy to chase them. Harker stood finally on firm ground and studied the cliff.</p>
    <p>The rock was roughened by weather, hacked at by ages of erosion, savaged by earthquake. There were stretches of loose shale and great slabs that looked as though they would peel off at a touch, but Harker nodded.</p>
    <p>"We can climb it," he said. "Question is, how high is up?"</p>
    <p>Sim laughed. "High enough for the Golden City, maybe. Have we all got a clear conscience? Can't carry no load of sin that far!"</p>
    <p>Rory McLaren looked at Harker.</p>
    <p>Harker said, "All right, I confess. I don't care if there's land up there or not. All I wanted was to get the hell out of that damn boat before I went clean nuts. So now you know."</p>
    <p>McLaren nodded. He didn't seem surprised. "Let's climb."</p>
    <p>By morning of the second day they were in the clouds. They crawled upward through opal-tinted steam, half liquid, hot and unbearable. They crawled for two more days. The first night or two Sim sang during his watch, while they rested on some ledge. After that he was too tired. McLaren began to give out, though he wouldn't say so. Matt Harker grew more taciturn and ill-tempered, if possible, but otherwise there was no change. The clouds continued to hide the top of the cliff.</p>
    <p>During one rest break McLaren said hoarsely, "Don't these cliffs ever end?" His skin was yellowish, his eyes glazed with fever.</p>
    <p>"Maybe," said Harker, "they go right up beyond the sky." The fever was on him again, too. It lived in the marrow of the exiles, coming out at intervals to shake and sear them, and then retreating. Sometimes it did not retreat, and after nine days there was no need.</p>
    <p>McLaren said, "You wouldn't care if they did, would you?"</p>
    <p>"I didn't ask you to come."</p>
    <p>"But you wouldn't care."</p>
    <p>"Ah, shut up."</p>
    <p>McLaren went for Harker's throat.</p>
    <p>Harker hit him, with great care and accuracy. McLaren sagged down and took his head in his hands and wept. Sim stayed out of it.</p>
    <p>He shook his head, and after a while he began to sing to himself, or someone beyond himself. "Oh, nobody knows the trouble I see . . . ."</p>
    <p>Harker pulled himself up. His ears rang and he shivered uncontrollably, but he could still take some of McLaren's weight on himself. They were climbing a steep ledge, fairly wide and not difficult.</p>
    <p>"Let's get on," said Harker.</p>
    <p>About two hundred feet beyond that point the ledge dipped and began to go down again in a series of broken steps. Overhead the cliff face bulged outward. Only a fly could have climbed it. They stopped. Harker cursed with vicious slowness. Sim closed his eyes and smiled. He was a little crazy with fever himself.</p>
    <p>"Golden City's at the top. That's where I'm going."</p>
    <p>He started off along the ledge, following its decline toward a jutting shoulder, around which it vanished. Harker laughed sardonically. McLaren pulled free of him and went doggedly after Sim. Harker shrugged and followed.</p>
    <p>Around the shoulder the ledge washed out completely.</p>
    <p>They stood still. The steaming clouds shut them in before, and behind was a granite wall hung within thick fleshy creepers. Dead end.</p>
    <p>"Well?" said Harker.</p>
    <p>McLaren sat down. He didn't cry, or say anything. He just sat. Sim stood with his arms hanging and his chin on his huge black chest. Harker said, "See what I meant, about the Promised Land? Venus is a fixed wheel, and you can't win."</p>
    <p>It was then that he noticed the cool air. He had thought it was just a fever chill, but it lifted his hair, and it had a definite pattern on his body. It even had a cool, clean smell to it. It was blowing out through the creepers.</p>
    <p>Harker began ripping with his knife. He broke through into a cave mouth, a jagged rip worn smooth at the bottom by what must once have been a river.</p>
    <p>"That draft is coming from the top of the plateau," Harker said. "Wind must be blowing up there and pushing it down. There may be a way through."</p>
    <p>McLaren and Sim both showed a slow, terrible growth of hope. The three of them went without speaking into the tunnel.</p>
    <empty-line/>
   </section>
   <section>
    <title>
     <p>II</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>They made good time. The clean air acted as a tonic, and hope spurred them on. The tunnel sloped upward rather sharply, and presently Harker heard water, a low thunderous murmur as of an underground river up ahead. It was utterly dark, but the smooth channel of stone was easy to follow.</p>
    <p>Sim said, "Isn't that light up ahead?"</p>
    <p>"Yeah," said Harker. "Some kind of phosphorescence. I don't like that river. It may stop us."</p>
    <p>They went on in silence. The glow grew stronger, the air more damp. Patches of phosphorescent lichen appeared on the walls, glimmering with dim jewel tones like an unhealthy rainbow. The roar of the water was very loud.</p>
    <p>They came upon it suddenly. It flowed across the course of their tunnel in a broad channel worn deep into the rock, so that its level had fallen below its old place and left the tunnel dry. It was a wide river, slow and majestic. Lichen spangled the roof and walls, reflecting in dull glints of color from the water.</p>
    <p>Overhead there was a black chimney going up through the rock, and the cool draft came from there with almost hurricane force, much of which was dissipated in the main river tunnel. Harker judged there was a cliff formation on the surface that siphoned the wind downward. The chimney was completely inaccessible.</p>
    <p>Harker said, "I guess we'll have to go upstream, along the side." The rock was eroded enough to make that possible, showing wide ledges at different levels.</p>
    <p>McLaren said, "What if this river doesn't come from the surface? What if it starts from an underground source?"</p>
    <p>"You stuck your neck out," Harker said. "Come on."</p>
    <p>They started. After a while, tumbling like porpoises in the black water, the golden creatures swam by, and saw the men, and stopped, and swam back again.</p>
    <p>They were not very large, the largest about the size of a twelve-year-old child. Their bodies were anthropoid, but adapted to swimming with shimmering webs. They glowed with a golden light, phosphorescent like the lichen, and their eyes were lidless and black, like one huge spreading pupil. Their faces were incredible. Harker could remember, faintly, the golden dandelions that grew on the lawn in summer. The heads and faces of the swimmers were like that, covered with streaming petals that seemed to have independent movements, as though they were sensory organs as well as decoration.</p>
    <p>Harker said, "For cripesake, what are they?"</p>
    <p>"They look like flowers," McLaren said.</p>
    <p>"They look more like fish," the black man said.</p>
    <p>Harker laughed. "I'll bet they're both. I'll bet they're plannies that grew where they had to be amphibious." The colonists had shortened plant-animal to planimal, and then just planny. "I've seen gimmicks in the swamps that weren't so far away from these. But jeez, get the eyes on 'em! They look human."</p>
    <p>"The shape's human, too, almost." McLaren shivered. "I wish they wouldn't look at us that way."</p>
    <p>Sim said, "As long as they just look. I'm not gonna worry . . . ."</p>
    <p>They didn't. They started to close in below the men, swimming effortlessly against the current. Some of them began to clamber out on the low ledge behind them. They were agile and graceful. There was something unpleasantly child-like about them. There were fifteen or twenty of them, and they reminded Harker of a gang of mischievous lads—only the mischief had a queer soulless quality of malevolence.</p>
    <p>Harker led the way faster along the ledge. His knife was drawn and he carried a short spear in his right hand.</p>
    <p>The tone of the river changed. The channel broadened, and up ahead Harker saw that the cavern ended in a vast shadowy place, the water spreading into a dark lake, spilling slowly out over a low wide lip of rock. More of the shining child-things were playing there. They joined their fellows, closing the ring tighter around the three men.</p>
    <p>"I don't like this," McLaren said. "If they'd only make a noise!"</p>
    <p>They did, suddenly—a shrill tittering like a blasphemy of childish laughter. Their eyes shone. They rushed in, running wetly along the ledge, reaching up out of the water to claw at ankles, laughing. Inside his tough flat belly Harker's guts turned over.</p>
    <p>McLaren yelled and kicked. Claws raked his ankle, spiny needle-sharp things like thorns. Sim ran his spear clean through a golden breast. There were no bones in it. The body was light and membranous, and the blood that ran out was sticky and greenish, like sap. Harker kicked two of the things back in the river, swung his spear like a ball bat and knocked two more off the ledge—they were unbelievably light—and shouted, "Up there, that high ledge. I don't think they can climb that."</p>
    <p>He thrust McLaren bodily past him and helped Sim fight a rearguard action while they all climbed a rotten and difficult transit. McLaren crouched at the top and hurled chunks of stone at the attackers. There was a great crack running up and clear across the cavern roof, scar of some ancient earthquake. Presently a small slide started.</p>
    <p>"Okay," Harker panted. "Quit before you bring the roof down. They can't follow us." The plannies were equipped for swimming, not climbing. They clawed angrily and slipped back, and then retreated sullenly to the water. Abruptly they seized the body with Sim's spear through it and devoured it, quarreling fiercely over it. McLaren leaned over the edge and was sick.</p>
    <p>Harker didn't feel so good himself. He got up and went on. Sim helped McLaren, whose ankle was bleeding badly.</p>
    <p>This higher ledge angled up and around the wall of the great lake-cavern. It was cooler and drier here, and the lichens thinned out, and vanished, leaving total darkness. Harker yelled once. From the echo of his voice the place was enormous.</p>
    <p>Down below in the black water golden bodies streaked like comets in an ebon universe, going somewhere, going fast. Harker felt his way carefully along. His skin twitched with a nervous impulse of danger, a sense of something unseen, unnatural, and wicked.</p>
    <p>Sim said, "I hear something."</p>
    <p>They stopped. The blind air lay heavy with a subtle fragrance, spicy and pleasant, yet somehow unclean. The water sighed lazily far below. Somewhere ahead was a smooth rushing noise which Harker guessed was the river inlet. But none of that was what Sim meant.</p>
    <p>He meant the rippling, rustling sound that came from everywhere in the cavern. The black surface of the lake was dotted now with spots of burning phosphorescent color, trailing fiery wakes. The spots grew swiftly, coming nearer, and became carpets of flowers, scarlet and blue and gold and purple. Floating fields of them, and towed by shining swimmers.</p>
    <p>"My God," said Harker softly. "How big are they?"</p>
    <p>"Enough to make three of me." Sim was a big man. "Those little ones were children, all right. They went and got their papas. Oh, Lord!"</p>
    <p>The swimmers were very like the smaller ones that attacked them by the river, except for their giant size. They were not cumbersome.</p>
    <p>They were magnificent, supple-limbed and light. Their membranes had spread into great shining wings, each rib tipped with fire. Only the golden dandelion heads had changed.</p>
    <p>They had shed their petals. Their adult heads were crowned with flat, coiled growths having the poisonous and filthy beauty of fungus. And their faces were the faces of men.</p>
    <p>For the first time since childhood Harker was cold.</p>
    <p>The fields of burning flowers were swirled together at the base of the cliff. The golden giants cried out suddenly, a sonorous belling note, and the water was churned to blazing foam as thousands of flower-like bodies broke away and started up the cliff on suckered, spidery legs.</p>
    <p>It didn't look as though it was worth trying, but Harker said, "Let's get the hell on!" There was a faint light now, from the army below. He began to run along the ledge, the others close on his heels. The flower-hounds coursed swiftly upward, and their masters swam easily below, watching.</p>
    <p>The ledge dropped. Harker shot along it like a deer. Beyond the lowest dip it plunged into the tunnel whence the river came. A short tunnel, and at the far end . . .</p>
    <p>"Daylight!" Harker shouted. "Daylight!"</p>
    <p>McLaren's bleeding leg gave out and he fell.</p>
    <p>Harker caught him. They were at the lowest part of the dip. The flower-beasts were just below, rushing higher. McLaren's foot was swollen, the calf of his leg discolored. Some swift infection from the planny's claws. He fought Harker. "Go on," he said. "Go on!"</p>
    <p>Harker slapped him hard across the temple. He started on, half carrying McLaren, but he saw it wasn't going to work. McLaren weighed more than he did. He thrust McLaren into Sim's powerful arms. The big black nodded and ran, carrying the half-conscious man like a child. Harker saw the first of the flower-things flow up onto the ledge in front of them.</p>
    <p>Sim hurdled them. They were not large, and there were only three of them. They rushed to follow and Harker speared them, slashing and striking with the sharp bone tip. Behind him the full tide rushed up. He ran, but they were faster. He drove them back with spear and knife, and ran again, and turned and fought again, and by the time they had reached the tunnel Harker was staggering with weariness.</p>
    <p>Sim stopped. He said, "There's no way out."</p>
    <p>Harker glanced over his shoulder. The river fell sheer down a high face of rock—too high and with too much force in the water even for the giant water-plannies to think of attempting. Daylight poured through overhead, warm and welcoming, and it might as well have been on Mars.</p>
    <p>Dead end.</p>
    <p>Then Harker saw the little eroded channel twisting up at the side. Little more than a drain-pipe, and long dry, leading to a passage beside the top of the falls—a crack barely large enough for a small man to crawl through. It was a hell of a ragged hope, but . . . .</p>
    <p>Harker pointed, between jabs at the swarming flowers. Sim yelled, "You first." Because Harker was the best climber, he obeyed, helping the gasping McLaren up behind him. Sim wielded his spear like a lightning brand, guarding the rear, creeping up inch by inch.</p>
    <p>He reached a fairly secure perch, and stopped. His huge chest pumped like a bellows, his arm rose and fell like a polished bar of ebony. Harker shouted to him to come on. He and McLaren were almost at the top.</p>
    <p>Sim laughed. "How you going to get me through that little bitty hole?"</p>
    <p>"Come on, you fool!"</p>
    <p>"You better hurry. I'm about finished."</p>
    <p>"Sim! Sim, damn you!"</p>
    <p>"Crawl out through that hole, runt, and pull that stringbean with you! I'm a man-sized man, and I got to stay." Then, furiously, "Hurry up or they'll drag you back before you're through."</p>
    <p>He was right. Harker knew he was right. He went to work pushing and jamming McLaren through the narrow opening. McLaren was groggy and not much help, but he was thin and small-boned, and he made it. He rolled out on a slope covered with green grass, the first Harker had seen since he was a child. He began to struggle after McLaren. He did not look back at Sim.</p>
    <p>The black man was singing, about the glory of the coming of the Lord.</p>
    <p>Harker put his head back into the darkness of the creek. "Sim!"</p>
    <p>"Yeah?" Faintly, hoarse, echoing.</p>
    <p>"There's land here, Sim. Good land."</p>
    <p>"Yeah."</p>
    <p>"Sim, we'll find a way . . . ."</p>
    <p>Sim was singing again. The sound grew fainter, diminishing downward into distance. The words were lost, but not what lay behind them. Matt Harker buried his face in the green grass, and Sim's voice went with him into the dark.</p>
    <p>The clouds were turning color with the sinking of the hidden sun. They hung like a canopy of hot gold washed in blood. It was utterly silent, except for the birds. Birds. You never heard birds like that down in the low places. Matt Harker rolled over and sat up slowly. He felt as though he had been beaten. There was a sickness in him, and a shame, and the old dark anger lying coiled and deadly above his heart.</p>
    <p>Before him lay the long slope of grass to the river, which bent away to the left out of sight behind a spur of granite. Beyond the slope was a broad plain and then a forest of gigantic trees. They seemed to float in the coppery haze, their dark branches outspread like wings and starred with flowers. The air was cool, with no taint of mud or rot. The grass was rich, the soil beneath it clean and sweet.</p>
    <p>Rory McLaren moaned softly and Harker turned. His leg looked bad. He was in a sort of stupor, his skin flushed and dry. Harker swore softly, wondering what he was going to do.</p>
    <p>He looked back toward the plain, and he saw the girl.</p>
    <p>He didn't know how she got there. Perhaps out of the bushes that grew in thick clumps on the slope. She could have been there a long time, watching. She was watching now, standing quite still about forty feet away. A great scarlet butterfly clung to her shoulder, moving its wings with lazy delight.</p>
    <p>She seemed more like a child than a woman. She was naked, small and slender and exquisite. Her skin had a faint translucent hint of green under its whiteness. Her hair, curled short to her head, was deep blue, and her eyes were blue also, and very strange.</p>
    <p>Harker stared at her, and she at him, neither of them moving. A bright bird swooped down and hovered by her lips for a moment, caressing her with its beak. She touched it and smiled, but she did not take her eyes from Harker.</p>
    <p>Harker got to his feet, slowly, easily. He said, "Hello."</p>
    <p>She did not move, nor make a sound, but quite suddenly a pair of enormous birds, beaked and clawed like eagles and black as sin, made a whistling rush down past Harker's head and returned, circling. Harker sat down again.</p>
    <p>The girl's strange eyes moved from him, upward to the crack in the hillside whence he had come. Her lips didn't move, but her voice—or something—spoke clearly inside Harker's head.</p>
    <p>"You came from—There." There had tremendous feeling in it, and none of it nice.</p>
    <p>Harker said, "Yes. A telepath, huh?"</p>
    <p>"But you're not . . . ." A picture of the golden swimmers formed in Harker's mind. It was recognizable, but hatred and fear had washed out all the beauty, leaving only horror.</p>
    <p>Harker said, "No." He explained about himself and McLaren. He told about Sim. He knew she was listening carefully to his mind, testing it for truth. He was not worried about what she would find. "My friend is hurt," he said. "We need food and shelter."</p>
    <p>For some time there was no answer. The girl was looking at Harker again. His face, the shape and texture of his body, his hair, and then his eyes. He had never been looked at quite that way before. He began to grin. A provocative, be-damned-to-you grin that injected a surprising amount of light and charm into his sardonic personality.</p>
    <p>"Honey," he said, "you are terrific. Animal, mineral, or vegetable?"</p>
    <p>She tipped her small round head in surprise, and asked his own question right back. Harker laughed. She smiled, her mouth making a small inviting V, and her eyes had sparkles in them. Harker started toward her.</p>
    <p>Instantly the birds warned him back. The girl laughed, a mischievous ripple of merriment. "Come," she said, and turned away.</p>
    <p>Harker frowned. He leaned over and spoke to McLaren, with peculiar gentleness. He managed to get the boy erect, and then swung him across his shoulders, staggering slightly under the weight. McLaren said distinctly, "I'll be back before he's born."</p>
    <p>Harker waited until the girl had started, keeping his distance. The two black birds followed watchfully. They walked out across the thick grass of the plain, toward the trees. The sky was now the color of blood.</p>
    <p>A light breeze caught the girl's hair and played with it. Matt Harker saw that the short curled strands were broad and flat, like blue petals.</p>

     <p>III</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>It was a long walk to the forest. The top of the plateau seemed to be bowl-shaped, protected by encircling cliffs. Harker, thinking back to that first settlement long ago, decided that this place was infinitely better. It was like the visions he had seen in fever-dreams—the Promised Land. The coolness and cleanness of it were like having weights removed from your lungs and heart and body.</p>
    <p>The rejuvenating air didn't make up for McLaren's weight, however. Presently Harker said, "Hold it," and sat down, tumbling McLaren gently onto the grass. The girl stopped. She came back a little way and watched Harker, who was blowing like a spent horse. He grinned up at her.</p>
    <p>"I'm shot." he said. "I've been too busy for a man of my age. Can't you get hold of somebody to help me carry him?"</p>
    <p>Again she studied him with puzzled fascination. Night was closing in, a clear indigo, less dark than at sea level. Her eyes had a curious luminosity in the gloom.</p>
    <p>"Why do you do that?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"Do what?"</p>
    <p>"Carry it."</p>
    <p>By "it" Harker guessed she meant McLaren. He was suddenly, coldly conscious of a chasm between them that no amount of explanation could bridge. "He's my friend. He's . . . I have to."</p>
    <p>She studied his thought and then shook her head. "I don't understand. It's spoiled—" her thought-image was a combination of "broken," "finished," and "useless"—"Why carry it around?"</p>
    <p>"McLaren's not an it. He's a man like me, my friend. He's hurt, and I have to help him."</p>
    <p>"I don't understand." Her shrug said it was his funeral, also that he was crazy. She started on again, paying no attention to Harker's call for her to wait. Perforce, Harker picked up McLaren and staggered on again. He wished Sim were here, and immediately wished he hadn't thought of Sim. He hoped Sim had died quickly before—before what? Oh God, it's dark and I'm scared and my belly's all gone to cold water, and that thing trotting ahead of me through the blue haze . . .</p>
    <p>The thing was beautiful, though. Beautifully formed, fascinating, a curved slender gleam of moonlight, a chaliced flower holding the mystic, scented nectar of the unreal, the unknown, the undiscovered. Harker's blood began, in spite of himself, to throb with a deep excitement.</p>
    <p>They came under the fragrant shadows of the trees. The forest was open, with broad mossy ridges and clearings. There were flowers underfoot, but no brush, and clumps of ferns. The girl stopped and stretched up her hand. A feathery branch, high out of her reach, bent and brushed her face, and she plucked a great pale blossom and set it in her hair.</p>
    <p>She turned and smiled at Harker. He began to tremble, partly with weariness, partly with something else.</p>
    <p>"How do you do that?" he asked.</p>
    <p>She was puzzled. "The branch, you mean? Oh, that!" She laughed. It was the first sound he had heard her make, and it shot through him like warm silver. "I just think I would like a flower, and it comes."</p>
    <p>Teleportation, telekinetic energy—what did the books call it? Back on Earth they knew something about that, but the colony hadn't had much time to study even its own meager library. There had been some religious sect that could make roses bend into their hands. Old wisdom, the force behind the Biblical miracles, just the infinite power of thought. Very simple. Yeah. Harker wondered uneasily whether she could work it on him, too. But then, he had a brain of his own. Or did he?</p>
    <p>"What's your name?" he asked.</p>
    <p>She gave a clear, trilled sound. Harker tried to whistle it and gave up. Some sort of tone-language, he guessed, without words as he knew them. It sounded as though they—her people, whatever they were—had copied the birds.</p>
    <p>"I'll call you Button," he said. "Bachelor Button—but you wouldn't know."</p>
    <p>She picked the image out of his mind and sent it back to him. Blue fringe-topped flowers nodding in his mother's china bowl. She laughed again and sent her black birds away and led on into the forest, calling out like an oriole. Other voices answered her, and presently, racing the light wind between the trees, her people came.</p>
    <p>They were like her. There were males, slender little creatures like young boys, and girls like Button. There were several hundred of them, all naked, all laughing and curious, their lithe pliant bodies flitting moth-fashion through the indigo shadows. They were topped with petals—Harker called them that, though he still wasn't sure—of all colors from blood-scarlet to pure white.</p>
    <p>They trilled back and forth. Apparently Button was telling them all about how she found Harker and McLaren. The whole mob pushed on slowly through the forest and ended finally in a huge clearing where there were only scattered trees. A spring rose and made a little lake, and then a stream that wandered off among the ferns.</p>
    <p>More of the little people came, and now he saw the young ones. All sizes, from tiny thin creatures on up, replicas of their elders. There were no old ones. There were none with imperfect or injured bodies. Harker, exhausted and on the thin edge of a fever-bout, was not encouraged.</p>
    <p>He set McLaren down by the spring. He drank, gasping like an animal, and bathed his head and shoulders. The forest people stood in a circle, watching. They were silent now. Harker felt coarse and bestial, somehow, as though he had belched loudly in church.</p>
    <p>He turned to McLaren. He bathed him, helped him drink, and set about fixing the leg. He needed light, and he needed flame.</p>
    <p>There were dry leaves, and mats of dead moss in the rocks around the spring. He gathered a pile of these. The forest people watched. Their silent luminous stare got on Harker's nerves. His hands were shaking so that he made four tries with his flint and steel before he got a spark.</p>
    <p>The tiny flicker made the silent ranks stir sharply. He blew on it. The flames licked up, small and pale at first, then taking hold, growing, crackling. He saw their faces in the springing light, their eyes stretched with terror. A shrill crying broke from them and then they were gone, like rustling leaves before a wind.</p>
    <p>Harker drew his knife. The forest was quiet now. Quiet but not at rest. The skin crawled on Harker's back, over his scalp, drew tight on his cheekbones. He passed the blade through the flame. McLaren looked up at him. Harker said, "It's okay, Rory," and hit him carefully on the point of the jaw. McLaren lay still. Harker stretched out the swollen leg and went to work.</p>
    <p>It was dawn again. He lay by the spring in the cool grass, the ashes of his fire gray and dead beside the dark stains. He felt rested, relaxed, and the fever seemed to have gone out of him. The air was like wine.</p>
    <p>He rolled over on his back. There was a wind blowing. It was a live, strong wind, with a certain smell to it. The trees were rollicking, almost shouting with pleasure. Harker breathed deeply. The smell, the pure clean edge . . .</p>
    <p>Suddenly he realized that the clouds were high, higher than he had ever known them to be. The wind swept them up, and the daylight was bright, so bright that . . .</p>
    <p>Harker sprang up. The blood rushed in him. There was a stinging blur in his eyes. He began to run, toward a tall tree, and he flung himself upward into the branches and climbed, recklessly, into the swaying top.</p>
    <p>The bowl of the valley lay below him, green, rich, and lovely. The gray granite cliffs rose around it, grew higher in the direction from which the wind blew. Higher and higher, and beyond them, far beyond, were mountains, flung towering against the sky.</p>
    <p>On the mountains, showing through the whipping veils of cloud, there was snow, white and cold and blindingly pure, and as Harker watched there was a gleam, so quick and fleeting that he saw it more with his heart than with his eyes . . . . Sunlight. Snowfields, and above them, the sun.</p>
    <p>After a long time he clambered down again into the silence of the glade. He stood there, not moving, seeing what he had not had time to see before.</p>
    <p>Rory McLaren was gone. Both packs, with food and climbing ropes and bandages and flint and steel were gone. The short spears were gone. Feeling on his hip, Harker found nothing but bare flesh. His knife and even his breech-clout had been taken.</p>
    <p>A slender, exquisite body moved forward from the shadows of the trees. Huge white blossoms gleamed against the curly blue that crowned the head. Luminous eyes glanced up at Harker, full of mockery and a subtle animation. Button smiled.</p>
    <p>Matt Harker walked toward Button, not hurrying, his hard sinewy face blank of expression. He tried to keep his mind that way, too. "Where is the other one, my friend?"</p>
    <p>"In the finish-place." She nodded vaguely toward the cliffs near where Harker and McLaren had escaped from the caves. Her thought-image was somewhere between rubbish-heap and cemetery, as nearly as Harker could translate it. It was also completely casual, a little annoyed that time should be wasted on such trifles.</p>
    <p>"Did you . . . is he still alive?"</p>
    <p>"It was when we put it there. It will be all right, it will just wait until it—stops. Like all of them."</p>
    <p>"Why was he moved? Why did you ..."</p>
    <p>"It was ugly." Button shrugged. "It was broken, anyway." She stretched her arms upward and lifted her head to the wind. A shiver of delight ran through her. She smiled again at Harker, sidelong.</p>
    <p>He tried to keep his anger hidden. He started walking again, not as though he had any purpose in mind, bearing toward the cliffs. His way lay past a bush with yellow flowers and thorny, pliant branches. Suddenly it writhed and whipped him across the belly. He stopped short and doubled over, hearing Button's laughter.</p>
    <p>When he straightened up she was in front of him. "It's red," she said, surprised, and laid little pointed fingers on the scratches left by the thorns. She seemed thrilled and fascinated by the color and feel of his blood. Her fingers moved, probing the shape of his muscles, the texture of his skin and the dark hair on his chest. They drew small lines of fire along his neck, along the ridge of his jaw, touching his features one by one, his eyelids, his black brows.</p>
    <p>"What are you?" whispered her mind to his.</p>
    <p>"This." Harker put his arms around her, slowly. Her flesh slid cool and strange under his hands, sending an indescribable shudder through him, partly pleasure, partly revulsion. He bent his head. Her eyes deepened, lakes of blue fire, and then he found her lips. They were cool and strange like the rest of her, pliant, scented with spice, the same perfume that came with sudden overpowering sweetness from her curling petals.</p>
    <p>Harker saw movement in the forest aisles, a clustering of bright flower-heads. Button drew back. She took his hand and led him away, off toward the river and the quiet ferny places along its banks. Glancing up, Harker saw that the two black birds were following overhead.</p>
    <p>"You are really plants, then? Flowers, like those?" He touched the white blossoms on her head.</p>
    <p>"You are really a beast, then? Like the furry, snarling things that climb up through the pass sometimes?"</p>
    <p>They both laughed. The sky above them was the color of clean fleece. The warm earth and crushed ferns were sweet beneath them. "What pass?" asked Harker.</p>
    <p>"Over there." She pointed off toward the rim of the valley. "It goes down to the sea, I think. Long ago we used to go down there but there's no need, and the beasts make it dangerous."</p>
    <p>"Do they," said Harker, and kissed her in the hollow below her chin. "What happens when the beasts come?"</p>
    <p>Button laughed. Before he could stir Harker was trapped fast in a web of creepers and tough fern, and the black birds were screeching and clashing their sharp beaks in his face.</p>
    <p>"That happens," Button said. She stroked the ferns. "Our cousins understand us, even better than the birds."</p>
    <p>Harker lay sweating, even after he was free again. Finally he said, "Those creatures in the underground lake. Are they your cousins?"</p>
    <p>Button's fear-thought thrust against his mind like hands pushing away. "No, don't . . . . Long, long ago the legend is that this valley was a huge lake, and the Swimmers lived in it. They were a different species from us, entirely. We came from the high gorges, where there are only barren cliffs now. This was long ago. As the lake receded, we grew more numerous and began to come down, and finally there was a battle and we drove the Swimmers over the falls into the black lake. They have tried and tried to get out, to get back to the light, but they can't. They send their thoughts through to us sometimes. They . . . ." She broke off. "I don't want to talk about them anymore."</p>
    <p>"How would you fight them if they did get out?" asked Harker easily. "Just with the birds and the growing things?"</p>
    <p>Button was slow in answering. Then she said, "I will show you one way." She laid her hand across his eyes. For a moment there was only darkness. Then a picture began to form—people, his own people, seen as reflections in a dim and distorted mirror but recognizable. They poured into the valley through a notch in the cliffs, and instantly every bush and tree and blade of grass was bent against them. They fought, slashing with their knives, making headway, but slowly. And then, across the plain, came a sort of fog, a thin drifting curtain of soft white.</p>
    <p>It came closer, moving with force of its own, not heeding the wind. Harker saw that it was thistledown. Seeds, borne on silky wings. It settled over the people trapped in the brush. It was endless and unhurrying, covering them all with a fine fleece. They began to writhe and cry out with pain, with a terrible fear. They struggled, but they couldn't get away.</p>
    <p>The white down dropped away from them. Their bodies were covered with countless tiny green shoots, sucking the chemicals from the living flesh and already beginning to grow.</p>
    <p>Button's spoken thought cut across the image. "I have seen your thoughts, some of them, since the moment you came out of the caves. I can't understand them, but I can see our plains gashed to the raw earth and our trees cut down and everything made ugly. If your kind came here, we would have to go. And the valley belongs to us."</p>
    <p>Matt Harker's brain lay still in the darkness of his skull, wary, drawn in upon itself. "It belonged to the Swimmers first."</p>
    <p>"They couldn't hold it. We can."</p>
    <p>"Why did you save me, Button? What do you want of me?"</p>
    <p>"There was no danger from you. You were strange. I wanted to play with you."</p>
    <p>"Do you love me, Button?" His fingers touched a large smooth stone among the fern roots.</p>
    <p>"Love? What is that?"</p>
    <p>"It's tomorrow and yesterday. It's hoping and happiness and pain, the complete self because it's selfless, the chain that binds you to life and makes living it worthwhile. Do you understand?"</p>
    <p>"No. I grow, I take from the soil and the light, I play with the others, with the birds and the wind and the flowers. When the time comes I am ripe with seed, and after that I go to the finish-place and wait. That's all I understand. That's all there is."</p>
    <p>He looked up into her eyes. A shudder crept over him. "You have no soul, Button. That's the difference between us. You live, but you have no soul."</p>
    <p>After that it was not so hard to do what he had to do. To do quickly, very quickly, the thing that was his only faint chance of justifying Sim's death. The thing that Button may have glimpsed in his mind but could not guard against, because there was no understanding in her of the thought of murder.</p>

    <p>The black birds darted at Harker, but the compulsion that sent them flickered out too soon. The ferns and creepers shook, and then were still, and the birds flew heavily away. Matt Harker stood up.</p>
    <p>He thought he might have a little time. The flower-people probably kept in pretty close touch mentally, but perhaps they wouldn't notice Button's absence for a while. Perhaps they weren't prying into his own thoughts, because he was Button's toy. Perhaps . . . .</p>
    <p>He began to run, toward the cliffs where the finish-place was. He kept as much as possible in the open, away from shrubs. He did not look again, before he left, at what lay by his feet.</p>
    <p>He was close to his destination when he knew that he was spotted. The birds returned, rushing down at him on black whistling wings. He picked up a dead branch to beat them off and it crumbled in his hands. Telekinesis, the power of mind over matter. Harker had read once that if you knew how you could always make your point by thinking the dice into position. He wished he could think himself up a blaster. Curved beaks ripped his arms. He covered his face and grabbed one of the birds by the neck and killed it. The other one screamed and this time Harker wasn't so lucky. By the time he had killed the second one he'd felt claws in him and his face was laid open along the cheekbones. He began to run again.</p>
    <p>Bushes swayed toward him as he passed. Thorny branches stretched. Creepers rose like snakes from the grass, and every green blade was turned knife-like against his feet. But he had already reached the cliffs and there were open rocky spaces and the undergrowth was thin.</p>
    <p>He knew he was near the finish-place because he could smell it. The gentle withered fragrance of flowers past their prime, and under that a dead, sour decay. He shouted McLaren's name, sick with dread that there might not be an answer, weak with relief when there was one. He raced over tumbled rocks toward the sound. A small creeper tangled his foot and brought him down. He wrenched it by the roots from its shallow crevice and went on. As he glanced back over his shoulder he saw a thin white veil, a tiny patch in the distant air, drifting toward him.</p>
    <p>He came to the finish-place.</p>
    <p>It was a box canyon, quite deep, with high sheer walls, so that it was almost like a wide well. In the bottom of it bodies were thrown in a dry, spongy heap. Colorless flower-bodies, withered and gray, an incredible compost pile.</p>
    <p>Rory McLaren lay on top of it, apparently unhurt. The two packs were beside him, with the weapons. Strewn over the heap, sitting, lying, moving feebly about, were the ones who waited, as Button had put it, to stop. Here were the aged, the faded and worn out, the imperfect and injured, where their ugliness could not offend. They seemed already dead mentally. They paid no attention to the men, nor to each other. Sheer blind vitality kept them going a little longer, as a geranium will bloom long after its cut stalk is desiccated.</p>
    <p>"Matt," McLaren said. "Oh, God, Matt, I'm glad to see you!"</p>
    <p>"Are you all right?"</p>
    <p>"Sure. My leg even feels pretty good. Can you get me out?"</p>
    <p>"Throw those packs up here."</p>
    <p>McLaren obeyed. He began to catch Harker's feverish mood, warned by Harker's bleeding, ugly face that something nasty was afoot. Harker explained rapidly while he got out one of the ropes and half hauled McLaren out of the pit. The white veil was close now. Very close.</p>
    <p>"Can you walk?" Harker asked.</p>
    <p>McLaren glanced at the fleecy cloud. Harker had told him about it. "I can walk." he said. "I can run like hell."</p>
    <p>Harker handed him the rope. "Get around the other side of the canyon. Clear across, see?" He helped McLaren on with his pack. "Stand by with the rope to pull me up. And keep to the bare rocks."</p>
    <p>McLaren went off. He limped badly, his face twisted with pain. Harker swore. The cloud was so close that now he could see the millions of tiny seeds floating on their silken fibers, thistledown guided by the minds of the flower-people in the valley. He shrugged into his pack straps and began winding bandages and tufts of dead grass around the bone tip of a recovered spear. The edge of the cloud was almost on him when he got a spark into the improvised torch and sprang down onto the heap of dead flower-things in the pit.</p>
    <p>He sank and floundered on the treacherous surface, struggling across it while he applied the torch. The dry, withered substance caught. He raced the flames to the far wall and glanced back. The dying creatures had not stirred, even when the fire engulfed them. Overhead, the edges of the seed-cloud flared and crisped. It moved on blindly over the fire. There was a pale flash of light and the cloud vanished in a puff of smoke.</p>
    <p>"Rory!" Harker yelled. "Rory!"</p>
    <p>For a long minute he stood there, coughing, strangling in thick smoke, feeling the rushing heat crisp his skin. Then, when it was almost too late, McLaren's sweating face appeared above him and the rope snaked down. Tongues of flame flicked his backside angrily as he ran monkey-fashion up the wall.</p>
    <p>They got away from there, higher on the rocky ground, slashing occasionally with their knives at brush and creepers they could not avoid. McLaren shuddered.</p>
    <p>"It's impossible," he said. "How do they do it?"</p>
    <p>"They're blood cousins. Or should I say sap. Anyhow, I suppose it's like radio control—a matter of transmitting the right frequencies. Here, take it easy a minute."</p>
    <p>McLaren sank down gratefully. Blood was seeping through the tight bandages where Harker had incised his wound. Harker looked back into the valley.</p>
    <p>The flower-people were spread out in a long crescent, their bright multicolored heads clear against the green plain. Harker guessed that they would be guarding the pass. He guessed that they had known what was going on in his mind as well as Button had. New form of communism, one mind for all and all for one mind. He could see that even without McLaren's disability they couldn't make it to the pass. Not a mouse could have made it.</p>
    <p>He wondered how soon the next seed-cloud would come.</p>
    <p>"What are we going to do, Matt? Is there any way . . ." McLaren wasn't thinking about himself. He was looking at the valley like Lucifer yearning at Paradise, and he was thinking of Viki. Not just Viki alone, but Viki as a symbol of thirty-eight hundred wanderers on the face of Venus.</p>
    <p>"I don't know," said Harker. "The pass is out, and the caves are out . . . hey! Remember when we were fighting off those critters by the river and you nearly started a cave-in throwing rocks? There was a fault there, right over the edge of the lake. An earthquake split. If we could get at it from the top and shake it down . . . ."</p>
    <p>It was a minute before McLaren caught on. His eyes widened. "A slide would dam up the lake . . . ."</p>
    <p>"If the level rose enough, the Swimmers could get out." Harker gazed with sultry eyes at the bobbing flower-heads below.</p>
    <p>"But if the valley's flooded, Matt, and those critters take over, where does that leave our people?"</p>
    <p>"There wouldn't be too much of a slide, I don't think. The rock's solid on both sides of the fault. And anyway, the weight of the water backed up there would push through anything, even a concrete dam, in a couple of weeks." Harker studied the valley floor intently. "See the way that slopes there? Even if the slide didn't wash out, a little digging would drain the flood off down the pass. We'd just be making a new river."</p>
    <p>"Maybe." McLaren nodded. "I guess so. But that still leaves the Swimmers. I don't think they'd be any nicer than these babies about giving up their land." His tone said he would rather fight Button's people any day.</p>
    <p>Harker's mouth twisted in a slow grin. "The Swimmers are water creatures, Rory. Amphibious. Also, they've lived underground, in total darkness, for God knows how long. You know what happens to angleworms when you get 'em out in the light. You know what happens to fungus that grows in the dark." He ran his fingers over his skin, almost with reverence. "Noticed anything about yourself, Rory? Or have you been too busy."</p>
    <p>McLaren stared. He rubbed his own skin, and winced, and rubbed again, watching his fingers leave streaks of livid white that faded instantly. "Sunburn," he said wonderingly. "My God. Sunburn!"</p>
    <p>Harker stood up. "Let's go take a look." Down below the flower-heads were agitated. "They don't like that thought, Rory. Maybe it can be done, and they know it."</p>
    <p>McLaren rose, leaning on a short spear like a cane. "Matt. They won't let us get away with it."</p>
    <p>Harker frowned. "Button said there were other ways beside the seed . . . ." He turned away. "No use standing here worrying about it."</p>
    <p>They started climbing again, very slowly on account of McLaren. Harker tried to gauge where they were in relation to the cavern beneath. The river made a good guide. The rocks were almost barren of growth here, which was a godsend. He watched, but he couldn't see anything threatening approaching from the valley. The flower-people were mere dots now, perfectly motionless.</p>
    <p>The rock formation changed abruptly. Ancient quakes had left scars in the shape of twisted strata, great leaning slabs of granite poised like dancers, and cracks that vanished into darkness.</p>
    <p>Harker stopped. "This is it. Listen, Rory. I want you to go off up there, out of the danger area . . . ."</p>
    <p>"Matt, I . . . ."</p>
    <p>"Shut up. One of us has got to be alive to take word back to the ships as soon as he can get through the valley. There's no great rush and you'll be able to travel in three-four days. You . . . ."</p>
    <p>"But why me? You're a better mountain man . . . ."</p>
    <p>"You're married," said Harker curtly. "It'll only take one of us to shove a couple of those big slabs down. They're practically ready to fall of their own weight. Maybe nothing will happen. Maybe I'll get out all right. But it's a little silly if both of us take the risk, isn't it?"</p>
    <p>"Yeah. But Matt . . . ."</p>
    <p>"Listen, kid." Harker's voice was oddly gentle. "I know what I'm doing. Give my regards to Viki and the . . . ."</p>
    <p>He broke off with a sharp cry of pain. Looking down incredulously, he saw his body covered with little tentative flames, feeble, flickering, gone, but leaving their red footprints behind them.</p>
    <p>McLaren had the same thing.</p>
    <p>They stared at each other. A helpless terror took Harker by the throat. Telekinesis again. The flower-people turning his own weapon against them. They had seen fire, and what it did, and they were copying the process in their own minds, concentrating, all of them together, the whole mental force of the colony centered on the two men. He could even understand why they focused on the skin. They had taken the sunburn-thought and applied it literally.</p>
    <p>Fire. Spontaneous combustion. A simple, easy reaction, if you knew the trick. There was something about a burning bush . . . .</p>
    <p>The attack came again, stronger this time. The flower-people were getting the feel of it now. It hurt. Oh God, it hurt. McLaren screamed. His loincloth and bandages began to smolder.</p>
    <p>What to do, thought Harker, quick, tell me what to do . . . .</p>
    <p>The flower-people focus on us through our minds, our conscious minds. Maybe they can't get the subconscious so easily, because the thoughts are not directed, they're images, symbols, vague things. Maybe if Rory couldn't think consciously they couldn't find him . . . .</p>
    <p>Another flare of burning, agonizing pain. In a minute they'll have the feel of it. They can keep it going . . . .</p>
    <p>Without warning, Harker slugged McLaren heavily on the jaw and dragged him away to where the rock was firm. He did it all with astonishing strength and quickness. There was no need to save himself. He wasn't going to need himself much longer.</p>
    <p>He went away a hundred feet or so, watching McLaren. A third attack struck him, sickened and dazed him so that he nearly fell. Rory McLaren was not touched.</p>
    <p>Harker smiled. He turned and ran back toward the rotten place in the cliffs. A part of his conscious thought was so strongly formed that his body obeyed it automatically, not stopping even when the flames appeared again and again on his flesh, brightening, growing, strengthening as the thought-energies of Button's people meshed together. He flung down one teetering giant of stone, and the shock jarred another loose. Harker stumbled on to a third, based on a sliding bed of shale, and thrust with all his strength and beyond it, and it went too, with crashing thunder.</p>
    <p>Harker fell. The universe dissolved into shuddering, roaring chaos beyond a bright veil of flame and a smell of burning flesh. By that time there was only one thing clear in Matt Harker's understanding—the second part of his conscious mind, linked to and even stronger than the first.</p>
    <p>The image he carried with him into death was a tall mountain with snow on its shoulders, blazing in the sun.</p>
    <p>It was night. Rory McLaren lay prone on a jutting shelf above the valley. Below him the valley was lost in indigo shadows, but there was a new sound in it—the swirl of water, angry and swift.</p>
    <p>There was new life in it, too. It rode the crest of the flood waters, burning gold in the blue night, shining giants returning in vengeance to their own place. Great patches of blazing jewel-toned phosphorescence dotted the water—the flower-hounds, turned loose to hunt. And in between them, rolling and leaping in deadly play, the young of the Swimmers went.</p>
    <p>McLaren watched them hunt the forest people. He watched all night, shivering with dread, while the golden titans exacted payment for the ages they had lived in darkness. By dawn it was all over. And then, through the day, he watched the Swimmers die.</p>
    <p>The river, turned back on itself, barred them from the caves. The strong bright light beat down. The Swimmers turned at first to greet it with a pathetic joy. And then they realized . . . .</p>
    <p>McLaren turned away. He waited, resting, until, as Harker had predicted, the block washed away and the backed-up water could flow normally again. The valley was already draining when he found the pass. He looked up at the mountains and breathed the sweet wind, and felt a great shame and humility that he was here to do it.</p>
    <p>He looked back toward the caves where Sim had died, and the cliffs above where he had buried what remained of Matt Harker. It seemed to him that he should say something, but no words came, only that his chest was so full he could hardly breathe. He turned mutely down the rocky pass, toward the Sea of Morning Opals and the thirty-eight hundred wanderers who had found a home.</p>

    <p>THE VEIL OF ASTELLAR</p>
   </title>
   <section>
    <title>
     <p>Foreword</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>A little over a year ago, Solar Arbitrary Time, a message rocket dropped into the receiving chute at the Interworld Space Authority headquarters on Mars.</p>
    <p>In it was a manuscript, telling a story so strange and terrible that it was difficult to believe that any sane human being could have been guilty of such crimes.</p>
    <p>However, through a year of careful investigation, the story has been authenticated beyond doubt, and now the ISA has authorized its release to the public, just exactly as it was taken from the battered rocket.</p>
    <p>The Veil—the light that came from nowhere to swallow ships-has disappeared. Spacemen all over the solar system, tramp traders and captains of luxury liners alike, have welcomed this knowledge as only men can who have lived in constant peril. The Veil is gone, and with it some of the crushing terror of the Alien Beyond.</p>
    <p>We know its full name now—the Veil of Astellar.</p>
    <p>We know the place of its origin; a world outlawed from space and time. We know the reason for its being. Through this story, written in the agony of one man's soul, we know these things—and we know the manner of the Veil's destruction.</p>

     <p>1: Corpse at the Canal</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>There had been a brawl at Madam Kan's, on the Jekkara Low-Canal. Some little Martian glory-holer had got too high on thil, and pretty soon the spiked knuckle-dusters they use around there began to flash, and the little Martian had pulled his last feed-valve.</p>
    <p>They threw what was left of him out onto the stones of the embankment almost at my feet. I suppose that was why I stopped—because I had to, or trip over him. And then I stared.</p>
    <p>The thin red sunlight came down out of a clear green sky. Red sand whispered in the desert beyond the city walls, and red-brown water ran slow and sullen in the canal. The Martian lay twisted over on his back, with his torn throat spilling the reddest red of all across the dirty stones.</p>
    <p>He was dead. He had green eyes, wide open, and he was dead.</p>
    <p>I stood by him. I don't know how long. There wasn't any time. No sunlight shimmered now, no sense of people passing, no sound-nothing!</p>
    <p>Nothing but his dead face looking up at me; green-eyed, with his lips pulled back off his white teeth.</p>
    <p>I didn't know him. Alive, he was just another Martian snipe. Dead, he was just meat.</p>
    <p>Dead, the Martian trash!</p>
    <p>No time. Just a dead man's face, smiling.</p>
    <p>And then something touched me. Thought, a sudden bursting flame of it, hit my mind, drawing it back like a magnet drawing heavy steel. Somebody's thought, directed at me. A raw, sick horror, a fear, and a compassion so deep it shook my heart— One clear, sharp thrust of word-images came to me now.</p>
    <p>"He looks like Lucifer crying for Heaven," the message said. "His eyes. Oh, Dark Angel, his eyes!"</p>
    <p>I shut those eyes. Sweat broke cold on me, I swayed, and then I made the world come back into focus again. Sunlight, sand, noise and stench and people crowding, the thunder of rockets from the spaceport two Mars miles away. All in focus. I looked up and saw the girl.</p>
    <p>She was standing just beyond the dead man, almost touching him. There was a young fellow with her. I saw him vaguely, but he didn't matter then. Nothing mattered but the girl. She was wearing a blue dress, and she was staring at me with a smoke-gray gaze out of a face as white as stripped bone.</p>
    <p>The sunlight and the noise and people went away again, leaving me alone with her. I felt the locket burn me under my spaceman's black, and my heart seemed to stop beating.</p>
    <p>"Missy," I said. "Missy."</p>
    <p>"Like Lucifer, but Lucifer turned saint," her mind was saying.</p>
    <p>I laughed of a sudden, short and harsh. The world came back in place and stayed there, and so did I.</p>
    <p>Missy. Missy, bosh! Missy's been dead a long, long time.</p>
    <p>It was the red hair that fooled me. The same dark red hair, straight and heavy as a horse's tail, coiled on her white neck, and her smoke-gray eyes. Something, too, about her freckles and the way her mouth pulled up on one side as though it couldn't stop smiling.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, she didn't look much like Missy. She was taller and bonier. Life had kicked her around some, and she showed it. Missy never had worn that tired, grim look. I don't know whether she had developed a tough, unbreakable character, such as the girl before me, either. I couldn't read minds, then.</p>
    <p>This girl, looking at me, had a lot in her mind that she wouldn't want known. I didn't like the idea of her catching me in a rare off-moment.</p>
    <p>"What do you babies think you're doing here?" I said.</p>
    <p>The young man answered me. He was a lot like her—plain, simple, a lot tougher inside than he looked—a kid who had learned how to take punishment and go on fighting. He was sick now, and angry, and a little scared.</p>
    <p>"We thought, in broad daylight it would be safe," he answered.</p>
    <p>"Day or night, it's all the same to this hole. I'd get out."</p>
    <p>Without moving, the girl was still looking at me, not even realizing that she was doing it. "White hair," she was thinking. "But he isn't old. Not much older than Brad, in spite of the lines. Suffering, not age."</p>
    <p>"You're off the Queen of Jupiter, aren't you?" I asked them.</p>
    <p>I knew they were. The Queen was the only passenger tub in Jekkara then. I was interested only because she looked like Missy. But Missy had been dead, a long time.</p>
    <p>The young man she thought of as Brad spoke.</p>
    <p>"Yes." he said. "We're going out to Jupiter, to the colonies." He pulled at the girl, gently. "Come on, Virgie. We'd better go back to the ship."</p>
    <p>I was sweating, and cold. Colder than the corpse at my feet. I laughed, but not loud.</p>
    <p>"Yes," I said. "Get back to the ship, where it's safe."</p>
    <p>The girl hadn't stirred, hadn't taken her eyes off me.</p>
    <p>Still afraid, not so compassionate now, but still with her mind on me.</p>
    <p>"His eyes burn," she was thinking. "What color are they? No color, really. Just dark and cold and burning. They've looked into horror—and heaven. . ."</p>
    <p>I let her look into them. She flushed after a while, and I smiled. She was angry, but she couldn't look away, and I held her, smiling, until the young man pulled her again, not so gently.</p>
    <p>"Come on, Virgie."</p>
    <p>She broke free from me then, turning with an angular, coltish grace. My stomach felt like somebody stabbed it, suddenly. The way she held her head. . .</p>
    <p>She looked back at me, sullenly, not wanting to.</p>
    <p>"You remind me of someone," she said. "Are you from the Queen of Jupiter, too?"</p>
    <p>Her voice was like Missy's. Deeper, maybe. Throatier. But enough like it.</p>
    <p>"Yeah. Spaceman, First Class."</p>
    <p>"Then maybe that's where I noticed you." She turned the wedding ring on her finger, not thinking about it, and frowned. "What's your name?"</p>
    <p>"Goat," I said. "J. Goat."</p>
    <p>"Jay Goat," she repeated. "What an odd name. But it's not unusual. I wonder why it interests me so much."</p>
    <p>"Come on, Virgie," Brad said crossly.</p>
    <p>I didn't give her any help. I looked at her until she flushed crimson and turned away. I read her thoughts. They were worth reading.</p>
    <p>She and Brad went off toward the spaceport, walking close together, back to the Queen of Jupiter, and I stumbled over the dead Martian at my feet.</p>
    <p>The pinched grayness had crawled in over his face. His green eyes were glazed and already sunken, and his blood was turning dark on the stones. Just another corpse.</p>
    <p>I laughed. I put my black boot under the twist of his back and pushed him off into the sullen, red-brown water, and I laughed because my own blood was still hot and beating in me so hard it hurt.</p>
    <p>He was dead, so I let him go.</p>
    <p>I smiled at the splash and the fading ripples. "She was wrong," I thought. "It isn't Jay. It's just plain J. Goat. J for Judas."</p>
    <p>There were about ten Mars hours to kill before the Queen blasted off. I had a good run at the getak tables in Madam Kan's. She found me some special desert-cactus brandy and a Venusian girl with a hide like polished emerald and golden eyes.</p>
    <p>She danced for me, and she knew how. It wasn't a bad ten hours, for a Jekkara dive.</p>
    <p>Missy, the dead Martian, and the girl named Virgie went down in my subconscious where they belonged, and didn't leave even a ripple. Things like that are like the pain of an old wound when you twist it. They get you for a minute, but they don't last. They aren't important any more.</p>
    <p>Things can change. You planet-bound people build your four little walls of thought and roof them in with convention, and you think there's nothing else. But space is big, and there are other worlds, and other ways. You can learn them. Even you. Try it, and see.</p>
    <p>I finished the fiery green brandy. I filled the hollow between the Venusian dancer's emerald breasts with Martian silver and kissed her, and went away with a faint taste of fish on my lips, back toward the spaceport.</p>
    <p>I walked. It was night, with a thin, cold wind, rustling the sand and the low moons spilling silver and wild black shadows across the dunes. I could see my aura glowing, pale gold against the silver.</p>
    <p>I felt swell. The only thing I thought about concerning the Queen of Jupiter was that pretty soon my job would be finished and I'd be paid.</p>
    <p>I stretched with a pleasure you wouldn't know anything about, and it was a wonderful thing to be alive.</p>
    <p>It was lonely out there on the moonswept desert a mile from the spaceport, when Gallery stepped out from behind a mined tower that might have been a lighthouse once, when the desert was a sea.</p>
    <p>Gallery was king-snipe of the glory hole. He was Black Irish, and moderately drunk, and his extra-sensory perception was quivering in him like a sensitive diaphragm. I knew he could see my aura. Very faintly, and not with his eyes, but enough. I knew he had seen it the first time he met me, when I signed aboard the Queen of Jupiter on Venus.</p>
    <p>You meet them like that occasionally. Celts especially, and Romanies, both Earth and Martian, and a couple of tribes of Venusians. Extra-sensory perception is born into them. Mostly it's crude, but it can get in your way.</p>
    <p>It was in my way now. Gallery had four inches on me, and about thirty pounds, and the whisky he'd drunk was just enough to make him fast, mean, and dangerous. His fists were large.</p>
    <p>"You ain't human," he said softly.</p>
    <p>He was smiling. He might have been making love to me, with his smile and his beautiful soft voice. The sweat on his face made it look like polished wood in the moonlight.</p>
    <p>"No, Gallery," I said. "Not any more. Not for a long time."</p>
    <p>He swayed slightly, over his flexed knees. I could see his eyes. The blueness was washed out of them by the moonlight. There was only fear left, hard and shining.</p>
    <p>His voice was still soft, still singing. "What are you, then? And what will you be wantin' with the ship?"</p>
    <p>"Nothing with the ship, Gallery. Only with the people on her. And as to what I am, what difference does it make?"</p>
    <p>"None," said Gallery. "None. Because I'm going to kill you, now."</p>
    <p>I laughed, not making any sound.</p>
    <p>He nodded his black head slowly. "Show me your teeth, if you will. You'll be showin' them to the desert sky soon, out of a picked skull."</p>
    <p>He opened his hands. The racing moonlight showed me a silver crucifix in each of his palms.</p>
    <p>"No, Gallery," I said softly. "Maybe you could call me a vampire, but I'm not that kind."</p>
    <p>He closed his hands again over the crosses and started forward, one slow step at a time. I could hear his boots in the blowing sand. I didn't move.</p>
    <p>"You can't kill me, Gallery."</p>
    <p>He didn't stop. He didn't speak. The sweat was trickling down his skin. He was afraid, but he didn't stop.</p>
    <p>"You'll die here, Gallery, without a priest."</p>
    <p>He didn't stop.</p>
    <p>"Go on to the town, Gallery. Hide there till the Queen's gone. You'll be safe. Do you love the others enough to die for them?"</p>
    <p>He stopped, then. He frowned, like a puzzled kid. It was a new thought.</p>
    <p>I got the answer before he said it.</p>
    <p>"What does love have to do with it? They're people."</p>
    <p>He came on again, and I opened my eyes, wide.</p>
    <p>"Gallery," I said.</p>
    <p>He was close. Close enough to smell the raw whisky on his breath. I looked up into his face. I caught his eyes and held them, and he stopped, slowly, dragging his feet as though all of a sudden there were weights on them.</p>
    <p>I held his eyes. I could hear his thoughts. They were the same. They're always the same.</p>
    <p>He raised his fists up, too slowly, as though he might be lifting a man's weight on each of them. His lips drew back. I could see the wet shine of his teeth and hear the labored breath go between them, hoarse and rough.</p>
    <p>I smiled at him, and held his eyes with mine.</p>
    <p>He went down to his knees. Inch by inch, fighting me, but down. A big man with sweat on his face and blue eyes that couldn't look away. His hands opened. The silver crosses fell out and lay there glittering on the sand.</p>
    <p>His head went back. The cords roped out in his neck and jerked, and then suddenly he fell over on his side and lay still.</p>
    <p>"My heart," he whispered. "You've stopped it."</p>
    <p>That's the only way. What they feel about us is instinct, and even psycho-surgery won't touch that. Besides, there's never time.</p>
    <p>He couldn't breathe, now. He couldn't speak, but I heard his thoughts. I picked the crucifixes out of the sand and folded his fingers over them.</p>
    <p>He managed to turn his head a little and look at me. He tried to speak, but again it was his thought I answered.</p>
    <p>"Into the Veil, Gallery," I whispered. "That's where I'm leading the Queen."</p>
    <p>I saw his eyes widen and fix. The last thought he had was—well, never mind that. I dragged him back into the ruined tower where no one would be likely to find him for a long time, and started on again for the spaceport. And then I stopped.</p>
    <p>He'd dropped the crosses again. They were lying in the path with the moonlight on them, and I picked them up, thinking I'd throw them out into the blowing sand where they wouldn't be seen.</p>
    <p>I didn't. I stood holding them. They didn't burn my flesh. I laughed.</p>
    <p>Yeah. I laughed. But I couldn't look at them.</p>
    <p>I went back in the tower and stretched Gallery on his back with his hands crossed on his chest, and closed his eyes. I laid a crucifix on each of his eyelids and went out, this time for good.</p>
    <p>Shirina said once that you could never understand a human mind completely no matter how well you knew it. That's where the suffering comes in. You feel fine, everything's beautiful, and then all of a sudden a trapdoor comes open somewhere in your brain, and you remember.</p>
    <p>Not often, and you learn to kick them shut, fast. But even so, Flack is the only one of us that still has dark hair, and he never had a soul to begin with.</p>
    <p>Well, I kicked the door shut on Gallery and his crosses, and half an hour later the Queen of Jupiter blasted off for the Jovian colonies, and a landing she was never going to make.</p>

     <p>2: Voyage into Doom</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Nothing happened until we hit the outer fringe of the Asteroid Belt. I'd kept watch on the minds of my crewmates, and I knew Gallery hadn't mentioned me to anyone else. You don't go around telling people that the guy in the next bunk gives off a yellow glow and isn't human, unless you want to wind up in a straitjacket. Especially when such things are something you sense but can't see, like electricity.</p>
    <p>When we came into the danger zone inside the Belt, they set the precautionary watches at the emergency locks on the passenger decks, and I was assigned to one of them. I went up to take my station.</p>
    <p>Just at the top of the companionway I felt the first faint reaction of my skin, and my aura began to pulse and brighten.</p>
    <p>I went on to the Number Two lock and sat down.</p>
    <p>I hadn't been on the passenger deck before. The Queen of Jupiter was an old tub from the Triangle trade, refitted for deep-space hauling. She held together, and that's all. She was carrying a heavy cargo of food, seed, clothing, and farm supplies, and about five hundred families trying for a fresh start in the Jovian colonies.</p>
    <p>I remembered the first time I saw Jupiter. The first time any man from Earth ever saw Jupiter. That was long ago.</p>
    <p>Now the deck was jammed. Men, women, kids, mattresses, bags, bundles, and what have you. Martians, Venusians, Terrans, all piled in together, making a howling racket and smelling very high in the combined heat of the sun and the press of bodies.</p>
    <p>My skin was tingling and beginning to crawl. My aura was brighter.</p>
    <p>I saw the girl. The girl named Virgie with her thick red hair and her colt's way of moving. She and her husband were minding a wiry, green-eyed Martian baby while its mother tried to sleep, and they were both thinking the same thing.</p>
    <p>"Maybe, some day when things are better, we'll have one of our own."</p>
    <p>I remember thinking that Missy would have looked like that holding our kid, if we'd ever had one.</p>
    <p>My aura pulsed and glowed.</p>
    <p>I watched the little worlds flash by, still far ahead of the ship, all sizes, from pebbles to habitable planetoids, glittering in the raw sunlight and black as space on their shadow sides. People crowded up around the ports, and I got to looking at one old man standing almost beside me.</p>
    <p>He had space stamped all over him, in the way he carried his lean frame and the lines in his leathery face, and the hungry-hound look of his eyes watching the Belt. An old rocket-hustler who had done plenty in his day, and remembered it all.</p>
    <p>And then Virgie came up. Of all the women on deck it had to be Virgie. Brad was with her, and she was still holding the baby. She had her back to me, looking out.</p>
    <p>"It's wonderful," she said softly. "Oh, Brad, just look at it!"</p>
    <p>"Wonderful, and deadly," the old spaceman said to himself. He looked around and smiled at Virgie. "Your first trip out?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, for both of us. I suppose we're very starry-eyed about it, but it's strange." She made a little helpless gesture.</p>
    <p>"I know. There aren't any words for it." He turned back to the port. His voice and his face were blank, but I could read his mind.</p>
    <p>"I used to kick the supply ships through to the first settlement, fifty years ago," he said. "There were ten of us, doing that. I'm the only one left."</p>
    <p>"The Belt was dangerous then, before they got the Rosson deflectors," Brad said.</p>
    <p>"The Belt," said the old man softly, "only got three of them."</p>
    <p>Virgie lifted her red head. "Then what. . ."</p>
    <p>The old man didn't hear her. His thoughts were way off.</p>
    <p>"Six of the best men in space, and then, eleven years ago, my son," he said, to no one.</p>
    <p>A woman standing beside him turned her head. I saw the wide, raw shine of terror in her eyes, and the sudden stiffness of her lips,</p>
    <p>"The Veil?" she whispered. "That's what you mean, isn't it? The Veil?"</p>
    <p>The old man tried to shut her up, but Virgie broke in.</p>
    <p>"What about the Veil?" she asked. "I've heard of it, vaguely. What is it?"</p>
    <p>The Martian baby was absorbed in a silver chain she wore around her neck. I remember thinking it looked familiar. Probably she'd had it on the first time I saw her. My aura glowed, a hot bright gold.</p>
    <p>The woman's voice, answering, had an eerie quality of distance in it, like an echo. She was staring out of the port now.</p>
    <p>"Nobody knows," she said. "It can't be found, or traced, or tested at all. My brother is a spaceman. He saw it once from a great distance, reaching from nowhere to swallow a ship. A veil of light. It faded, and the ship was gone! My brother saw it out here, close to the Belt."</p>
    <p>"There's no more reason to expect it here than anywhere," the old spaceman said roughly. "It's taken ships as far in as Earth's orbit. There's no reason to be afraid."</p>
    <p>My aura burned around me like a cloud of golden light, and my skin was alive with a subtle current.</p>
    <p>The green-eyed Martian baby yanked the silver chain suddenly and crowed, holding its hands high. The thing on the end of the chain, that had been hidden under Virgie's dress, spun slowly round and round, and drew my eyes, and held them.</p>
    <p>I must have made some sound, because Virgie looked around and saw me. I don't know what she thought. I didn't know anything for a long time, except that I was cold, as though some of the dead, black space outside had come in through the port somehow and touched me.</p>
    <p>The shiny thing spun on the end of the silver chain, and the green-eyed baby watched it, and I watched it.</p>
    <p>After that there was darkness, with me standing in the middle of it quite still, and cold, cold, cold!</p>
    <p>Virgie's voice came through the darkness, calm, casual, as though none of it mattered at all.</p>
    <p>I've remembered who it is you made me think of, Mr. Goat," she said. "I'm afraid I was rather rude that day on Mars, but the resemblance puzzled me. Look."</p>
    <p>A white object came into my shell of ice and blackness. It was a strong white hand, reddened across the knuckles with work, holding something in the palm. Something that burned with a clear, terrible light of its own. Her voice went on, so very quietly.</p>
    <p>"This locket, Mr. Goat. It's ancient. Over three hundred years old. It belonged to an ancestor of mine, and the family has kept it ever since. It's rather a lovely story. She married a young spaceman. In those days, of course, space flight was still new and dangerous, and this young man loved it as much as he did his wife. His name was Stephen Vance. That's his picture. That's why I thought I had seen you somewhere before, and why I asked your name. I think the resemblance is quite striking, don't you?"</p>
    <p>"Yes," I said. "Yes, it is."</p>
    <p>"The girl is his wife, and of course, the original owner of the locket. He called her Missy. It's engraved on the back of the locket. Anyway, he had a chance to make the first flight from Mars to Jupiter, and Missy knew how much it meant to him. She knew that something of him would die if he didn't go, and so she let him. He didn't know how soon the baby they'd both wanted so much would arrive, for she didn't tell him that. Because she knew he wouldn't go if she did.</p>
    <p>"So Stephen had two lockets made, this one and another just like it. He told her they'd make a link between them, he and Missy, that nothing could break. Sometime, somehow, he'd come back to her, no matter what happened. Then he went to Jupiter. He died there. His ship was never found.</p>
    <p>"But Missy went on wearing the locket and praying. And when she died she gave it to her daughter. It grew into a sort of family tradition. That's why I have it now."</p>
    <p>Her voice trailed off, drowsily, with a faint note of surprise. Her hand and the locket went away, and there was a great stillness all around me, a great peace,</p>
    <p>I brought my arms up across my face. I stiffened, and I tried to say something, words I used to say a long, long time ago. They wouldn't come. They won't, when you go into the Beyond Place.</p>
    <p>I took my hands away, and I could see again. I didn't touch the locket around my neck. I could feel it against my breast, like the cold of space, searing me.</p>
    <p>Virgie lay at my feet. She still held the baby in the bend of one arm. Its round brown face was turned to hers, smiling a little. Brad lay beside them, with one arm flung across them both.</p>
    <p>The locket lay on the gentle curve of Virgie's breast, face up, still open, rising and falling slowly to the lift of her breathing.</p>
    <p>They don't suffer. Remember that. They don't suffer. They don't even know. They sleep, and their dreams are happy. Remember, please! Not one of them has suffered, or been afraid.</p>
    <p>I stood alone in that silent ship. There were no stars beyond the port now, no little worlds riding the Belt. There was only a veil of light wrapped close around the ship, a soft web of green and purple and gold and blue spun on a shimmering gray woof that was not color at all, and held there with threads of scarlet.</p>
    <p>There was the familiar dimming of the electrics inside the ship. The people slept on the broad deck. I could hear their breathing, soft and slow and peaceful. My aura burned like a golden cloud around me, and inside it my body beat and pulsed with life.</p>
    <p>I looked down at the locket, at Missy's face. If you'd told me. Oh Missy, if you'd only told me, I could have saved you!</p>
    <p>Virgie's red hair, dark and straight and heavy in her white neck. Virgie's smoke-gray eyes, half open and dreaming. Missy's hair. Missy's eyes.</p>
    <p>Mine. Part of my flesh, part of my bone, part of my blood. Part of the life that still beat and pulsed inside me.</p>
    <p>Three hundred years.</p>
    <p>"Oh, if I could only pray!" I thought.</p>
    <p>I knelt down beside her. I put out my hand. The golden light came out of the flesh and veiled her face. I took my hand away and got up, slowly. More slowly than Gallery fell when he died.</p>
    <p>The shimmer of the Veil was all through the ship, now. In the air, in every atom of its wood and metal. I moved in it, a shining golden thing, alive and young, in a silent, sleeping world.</p>
    <p>Three hundred years, and Missy was dead, and now the locket had brought her back.</p>
    <p>Did Judas feel like this when the rope tore the life out of him?</p>
    <p>But Judas died.</p>
    <p>I walked in the silence, wrapped in my golden cloud, and my heartbeats shook me like the blows of a man's fist. A strong heart. A young, strong heart.</p>
    <p>The ship swerved slowly, drawn out of its arc of free fall toward Jupiter. The auxiliaries had not been cut in yet for the Belt. The Veil just closed around the hull and drew it, easily.</p>
    <p>It's just an application of will-power. Teleportation, the strength of mind and thought amplified by the X-crystals and directed like a radio beam. The release of energy between the force of thought and the force of gravity causes the light, the visible thing that spacemen call the Veil. The hypnotic sleep-impulse is sent the same way, through the X-crystals on Astellar.</p>
    <p>Shirina says it's a simple thing, a child's trick, in its own space-time matrix. All it requires is a focal point to guide it, a special vibration it can follow like a torch in the void, such as the aura around flesh, human or not, that has bathed in the Cloud.</p>
    <p>A Judas goat, to lead the sheep to slaughter.</p>
    <p>I walked in my golden light. The pleasure of subtle energies pricked and flared across my skin. I was going home.</p>
    <p>And Missy was still alive. Three hundred years, and she was still alive. Her blood and mine, alive together in a girl named Virgie.</p>
    <p>And I was taking her to Astellar, the world its own dimension didn't want.</p>
    <p>I guess it was the stopping of the current across my skin that roused me, half an eternity later. My aura had paled to its normal faintness. I heard the faint grating ring of metal on stone, and I knew the Queen of Jupiter had made her last landing. I was home.</p>
    <p>I was sitting on the edge of my own bunk. I didn't know how I got there. I was holding my head on my clenched fists, and when I opened them my own locket fell out. There was blood on my palms.</p>
    <p>I got up and walked through the silence, through the hard impersonal glare of the electrics, to the nearest airlock, and went out.</p>
    <p>The Queen of Jupiter lay in a rounded cradle of rock, worn smooth. Back at the top of the chute the space doors were closed, and the last echo of the air pumps was dying away against the low roof of the cavern. The rock is a pale translucent green, carved and polished into beauty that stabs you breathless, no matter how many times you see it.</p>
    <p>Astellar is a little world, only about half the size of Vesta. Outside it's nothing but black slag, without even a trace of mineral to attract a tramp miner. When they want to they can bend the light around it so that the finest spacescope can't find it, and the same thought-force that makes the Veil can move Astellar where they wish it to go.</p>
    <p>Since traffic through the Belt has grown fairly heavy, they haven't moved it much. They haven't had to.</p>
    <p>I went across the cavern in the pale green light. There's a wide ramp that goes up from the floor like the sweep of an angel's wing. Flack was waiting for me near the foot of it, outlined in the faint gold of his aura.</p>
    <p>"Hi, Steve," he said, and looked at the Queen of Jupiter with his queer gray eyes. His hair was as black as mine used to be, his skin space-burned dark and leathery. His eyes looked out of the darkness like pale spots of moonlight, faintly luminous and without a soul.</p>
    <p>I knew Flack before he became one of us, and I thought then that he was less human than the Astellarians.</p>
    <p>"A good haul this time, Steve?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"Yeah." I tried to get past him. He caught my arm.</p>
    <p>"Hey—what's eating you?" he said.</p>
    <p>"Nothing."</p>
    <p>I shook him off. He smiled and stepped in front of me. A big man, as big as Gallery and a lot tougher, with a mind that could meet mine on an equal footing.</p>
    <p>"Don't give me that, Stevie. Something's—he-ey!" He pushed my chin up suddenly, and his pale eyes glowed and narrowed.</p>
    <p>"What's this?" he said. "Tears?"</p>
    <p>He stared at me a minute, slack-jawed, and then he began to laugh. I hit him.</p>

     <p>3: Wages of Evil</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Flack went sprawling backward onto the lucent stone. I went by him up the curve of the ramp. I went fast, but it was already too late.</p>
    <p>The airlocks of the Queen of Jupiter opened behind me.</p>
    <p>I stopped. I stopped the way Gallery did in the blowing Martian sand, slowly, dragging weights on my feet. I didn't want to. I didn't want to turn around, but there was nothing I could do about it. My body turned, by itself.</p>
    <p>Flack was on his feet again, leaning up against the carved green wall, looking at me. Blood ran out over his lip and down his chin. He got out a handkerchief and held it over his mouth, and his eyes never left me, pale and still and glowing. The golden aura made a halo round his dark head, like the painting of a saint.</p>
    <p>Beyond him the locks of the ship were open, and the people were coming out.</p>
    <p>In their niche on the fourth level of Astellar the X-crystals were pulsing from pale gray to a black as endless and alien as the Coal Sack. Behind them was a mind, kindly and gentle, thinking, and the human cargo of the Queen heard its thoughts.</p>
    <p>They came out of the locks, walking steadily but without haste. They formed into a loose column and came across the green translucent floor of the cavern and up the ramp. Walking easily, their breathing deep and quiet, their eyes half open and full of dreams.</p>
    <p>Up the long sweeping ribbon of pale green stone, past Flack, past me, and into the hall beyond. They didn't see anything but their dreams. They smiled a little. They were happy, and not afraid.</p>
    <p>Virgie still carried the baby, drowsing in her arms, and Brad was still beside her. The locket had turned with her movements, hiding the pictures, showing me only its silver back.</p>
    <p>I watched them go. The hall beyond the ramp was gem-cut from milky crystal and inlaid with metals that came from another dimension, radioactive metals that filled the crystal walls and the air between them with softened, misty fire.</p>
    <p>They went slowly into the veil of mist and fire, and were gone.</p>
    <p>Flack spoke softly. "Steve."</p>
    <p>I turned back toward the sound of his voice. There was a strange blur over everything, but I could see the yellow glow of his aura, the dark strength of him outlined against the pale green rock. He hadn't moved. He hadn't taken his cold light eyes away from me.</p>
    <p>I had left my mind naked, unguarded, and I knew before he spoke that Flack had read it.</p>
    <p>He spoke through his bruised lips.</p>
    <p>"You're thinking you won't go into the Cloud again, because of that girl," he whispered. "You're thinking there must be some way to save her. But there isn't, and you wouldn't save her if you could. And you'll go into the Cloud again, Stevie. Twelve hours from now, when it's time, you'll walk into the Cloud with the rest of us. And do you know why?"</p>
    <p>His voice grew soft as the touch of a dove, with a sound of laughter under it.</p>
    <p>"Because you're afraid to die, Stevie, just like the rest of us. Even me, Flack, the guy that never had a soul. I never believed in any god but myself and I love life. But sometimes I look at a corpse lying in the street of some human sinkhole and curse it with all my heart because it didn't have to be afraid.</p>
    <p>"You'll go into the Cloud, because the Cloud is all that keeps you alive. And you won't care about the red-haired girl, Stevie. You wouldn't care if it was Missy herself giving her life to you, because you're afraid. We're not human any longer, Steve. We're gone beyond. We've sinned—sins there aren't even any names for in this dimension. And no matter what we believe in, or deny, we're afraid.</p>
    <p>"Afraid to die, Stevie. All of us. Afraid to die!"</p>
    <p>His words frightened me. I couldn't forget them. I was remembering them even when I saw Shirina.</p>
    <p>"I've found a new dimension, Stevie," Shirina said lazily. "A little one, between the Eighth and Ninth. It's so little we missed it before. We'll explore it, after the Cloud."</p>
    <p>She led me in our favorite room. It was cut from a crystal so black and deep that it was like being in outer space, and if you looked long enough you could see strange nebulae, far off, and galaxies that never were except in dreams.</p>
    <p>"How long before it's time?" I asked her.</p>
    <p>"An hour, perhaps less. Poor Stevie. It'll be over soon, and you'll forget."</p>
    <p>Her mind touched mine gently, with an intimate sweetness and comfort far beyond the touch of hands. She'd been doing that for hours, soothing the fever and the pain out of my thoughts. I lay without moving, sprawled on a couch so soft it was like a cloud. I could see the glow and shimmer of Shirina against the darkness without turning my head.</p>
    <p>I don't know how to describe Shirina. Physically she was close enough to humanity. The differences in structure were more subtle than mere shape. They were—well, they were right, and exotic, and beautiful in a way there aren't any words for.</p>
    <p>She, and her race, had no need of clothing. Their lazy, sinuous bodies had a fleecy covering that wasn't fur or feathers or tendrils but something of all three. They had no true color. They changed according to light, in an endless spectrum of loveliness that went far beyond the range you humans know.</p>
    <p>Now, in the dark, Shirina's aura glowed like warm pearl. I could see her face, faintly, the queer peaked triangular bones covered with skin softer than a humming-bird's breast, the dead-black, bottomless eyes, the crest of delicate antennae tipped with tiny balls of light like diamonds burning under gauze.</p>
    <p>Her thoughts clung around me gently. "There's no need to worry, Stevie," she was thinking. "The girl will go last. It's all arranged. You will enter the Cloud first of all, and there won't be the smallest vibration of her to touch you."</p>
    <p>"But she'll touch somebody, Shirina," I groaned. "And it makes it all different, somehow, even with the others. Time doesn't seem to mean much. She's—she's like my own kid."</p>
    <p>Shirina answered aloud, patiently, "But she isn't. Your daughter was born three hundred years ago. Three hundred years, that is, for your body. For you there isn't any reckoning. Time is different in every dimension. We've spent a thousand years in some of them, and more than that."</p>
    <p>Yes. I could remember those alien years. Dimensional walls are no barrier to thought. You lie under the X-crystals and watch them pulse from mist-gray to depthless black. Your mind is sucked out of you and projected along a tight beam of carefully planned vibration, and presently you're in another space, another time.</p>
    <p>You can take over any body that pleases you, for as long as you want. You can go between planets, between suns, between galaxies, just by thinking about it. You can see things, do things, taste experiences that all the languages of our space-time continuum put together have no words for.</p>
    <p>Shirina and I had done a lot of wandering, a lot of seeing, and a lot of tasting. And the interlocking universes are infinite.</p>
    <p>"I can't help worrying, Shirina," I told her. "I don't want to feel like this, but I can't help it. Right now I'm human. Just plain Steve Vance of Beverly Hills, California, on the planet Earth. I can't bear my memories."</p>
    <p>My throat closed up. I was sick, and covered with cold sweat, and closer to going crazy than ever before in all my Satan-knows-how-many years.</p>
    <p>Shirina's voice came through the darkness. It was like a bird-call, a flute, a ripple of water over stones, and like nothing that any of you ever heard or ever will hear.</p>
    <p>"Stevie," she said. "Listen to me. You're not human any more. You haven't been human since the first time you walked in the Cloud. You have no more contact with those people than they have with the beasts they raise for slaughter."</p>
    <p>"But I can't help remembering."</p>
    <p>"All right. Remember, then. Remember how from birth you were different from other men. How you had to go on and out, to see things no man had ever seen before, to fight space itself with your heart and your ship and your two hands."</p>
    <p>I could recall it. The first man to dare the Belt, the first man to see Jupiter blazing in his swarm of moons.</p>
    <p>"That's why, when we caught you in the Veil and brought you to Astellar, we saved you from the Cloud. You had something rare—a strength, a sweep of vision and desire. You could give us something we wanted, an easier contact with human ships. And in return, we gave you life and freedom."</p>
    <p>She paused, and added softly, "And myself, Stevie."</p>
    <p>"Shirina!" A lot of things met and mingled in our thoughts. Emotions born of alien bodies we had shared. Memories of battle and beauty, of terror and love, under suns that never burned afterward, even in one's dreams, I can't explain it. There aren't any words.</p>
    <p>"Shirina, help me!"</p>
    <p>Shirina's mind cradled mine like a mother's arms.</p>
    <p>"You weren't to blame in the beginning, Stevie. We did it to you under hypnosis, so that your brain could assimilate the change gradually, without shock. I led you myself into our world, like someone leading a child, and when you were finally freed, much time had passed. You had gone beyond humanity. Far beyond."</p>
    <p>"I could have stopped. I could have refused to go into the Cloud again, when I knew what it was. I could have refused to be a Judas goat, leading the sheep to slaughter."</p>
    <p>"Then why didn't you?"</p>
    <p>"Because I had what I wanted," I said slowly. "What I'd always wanted and never had a name for. Power and freedom such as no man ever had. I liked having it. When I thought about you and the things we could do together, and the things I could do alone, I'd have led the whole solar system into the Veil, and be hanged to it."</p>
    <p>I drew a harsh, tight breath and wiped the sweat from my palms.</p>
    <p>"And besides, I didn't feel human any longer. I wouldn't hurt them any more than I'd have mistreated a dog when I was still a man. But I didn't belong to them anymore."</p>
    <p>"Then why is it different now?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know. It just is. When I think of Virgie going under the crystals, and me walking in the Cloud, it's too much."</p>
    <p>"You've seen their bodies, afterward," Shirina said gently. "Not one atom is touched or changed, and they smile. There's no easier or kinder death in Creation."</p>
    <p>"I know," I said. "I know. But Virgie is my own."</p>
    <p>She'd walk under the X-crystals, smiling, with her red hair dark and shining and her smoke-gray eyes half open and full of dreams. She'd still have the baby in her arms, and Brad would walk beside her. And the X-crystals would pulse and burn with black strange fires, and she would lie down, still smiling, and that would be all.</p>
    <p>All, forever, for Virgie and Brad and the green-eyed Martian baby.</p>
    <p>But the life that had been in their bodies, the force that no man has a name for that makes the breath and blood and heat of living flesh, the ultimate vibration of the human soul—that life-force would rise up from the crystals, up into the chamber of the Cloud. And Shirina, and Shirina's people, and the four other men like me that weren't human any longer, would walk in it so that we could live.</p>
    <p>It hadn't really hit me before. It doesn't. You think of it at first, but it doesn't mean anything. There's no semantic referent for "soul" or "ego" or "life-force." You don't see anything, you don't have any contact with the dead. You don't even think much of death.</p>
    <p>All you know is you walk into a radiant Cloud, and you feel like a god, and you don't think of the human side of it because you aren't human any longer.</p>
    <p>"No wonder they threw you out of your own dimension!" I cried out.</p>
    <p>Shirina sighed. "They called us vampires; parasites—sybaritic monsters who lived only for sensation and pleasure. And they cast us into darkness. Well, perhaps they were right. I don't know. But we never hurt or frightened anyone, and when I think of the things they did to their own people, in blood and fear and hate, I'm terrified."</p>
    <p>She rose and came and stood over me, glowing like warm pearl against the space-deep crystal. The tiny tips of diamond fire burned on her antennae, and her eyes were like black stars.</p>
    <p>I put out my hands to her. She took them, and her touch broke down my control. I was crying suddenly, not making any sound.</p>
    <p>"Right or wrong, Stevie, you're one of us now," she said gently. I'm sorry this happened. I would have spared you, if you'd let me put your mind to sleep until it was over. But you've got to understand that. You left them, the humans, behind you, and you can never, never go back."</p>
    <p>After a long time I spoke. "I know, I understand."</p>
    <p>I felt her sigh and shiver, and then she drew back, still holding my hands.</p>
    <p>"It's time now, Stevie."</p>
    <p>I got up, slowly, and then I stopped. Shirina caught her breath suddenly.</p>
    <p>"Steve, my hands! You're hurting me!"</p>
    <p>I let them go. "Flack," I said, not talking to anybody. "He knew my weakness. At root and base, no matter how much I talk, I'm going into the Cloud again because I'm afraid. That's why I'll always go into the Cloud when it's time. Because I've sinned so deeply I'm afraid to die."</p>
    <p>"What is sin?" Shirina whispered.</p>
    <p>"God knows. God only knows."</p>
    <p>I brought her bird-soft body into my arms and kissed her, brushing my lips across the shining down of her cheek to her little crimson mouth. There was the faint, bitter taste of my tears in the kiss, and then I laughed, softly.</p>
    <p>I pulled the chain and locket from around my neck and dropped them on the floor, and we went out together, to the Cloud.</p>

     <p>4: Curtain of Darkness</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>We walked through the halls of Astellar, like people in the heart of a many-colored jewel. Halls of amber and amethyst and cinnabar, of dragon-green and gray the color of morning mist, and colors there are no names for in this dimension.</p>
    <p>The others joined us, coming from the crystal cells where they spent their time. Shirina's people, velvet-eyed and gentle, with their crowns of fire-tipped antennae. They were like a living rainbow in the jewel-light of the halls.</p>
    <p>Flack and myself and the three others—only five men, in all the time Astellar had been in our dimension, with the kind of minds Shirina's people wanted—wore our spaceman's black, walking in our golden auras.</p>
    <p>I saw Flack looking at me, but I didn't meet his eyes.</p>
    <p>We came, finally, to the place of the Cloud, in the center of Astellar. The plain ebon-colored doors stood open. Beyond them there was a mist like curdled sunshine, motes of pure, bright, gilded radiance, coiling and dancing in a cloud of living light.</p>
    <p>Shirina took my hand. I knew she wanted to keep me from thinking about the place below, where still through hypnotic command the men and women and children from the Queen of Jupiter were walking under the X-crystals to their last long sleep.</p>
    <p>I held her, tightly, and we stepped through into the Cloud.</p>
    <p>The light closed us in. We walked on something that was not rock, nor anything tangible, but a vibration of force from the X-crystals that held us on a tingling, buoyant web. And the golden, living light clung to us, caressing, spilling over the skin in tiny rippling waves of fire.</p>
    <p>I was hungry for it. My body stretched, lifting up. I walked on the vibrant web of power under my feet, my head up, the breath stopped in my throat, every separate atom of my flesh rejuvenated, throbbing and blazing and pulsing with life.</p>
    <p>Life!</p>
    <p>And then it hit me.</p>
    <p>I didn't want it to. I thought I had it down, down for good where it couldn't bother me anymore. I thought I'd made my peace with whatever soul I'd had, or lost. I didn't want to think.</p>
    <p>But I did. It struck me, suddenly. Like a meteor crashing a ship in space, like the first naked blaze of the sun when you clear the Darkside peaks of Mercury. Like death, the ultimate, final thing you can't dodge or get around.</p>
    <p>I knew what that life was and where it came from, and how it had changed me.</p>
    <p>It was Virgie. Virgie with her blasted red hair and her smoke-gray eyes, and Missy's life in her, and mine. Why did she have to be sent? Why did I have to meet her beside that dead Martian, on the Jekkara Low-Canal?</p>
    <p>But I had met her. And suddenly I knew. I knew!</p>
    <p>I don't remember what I did. I must have wrenched loose from Shirina's hand. I felt her startled thought touch my brain, and then it broke away and I was running through the golden Cloud, toward the exit beyond. Running without control, running at top speed.</p>
    <p>I think I tried to scream. I don't know. I was clean crazy. But I can remember even then that I sensed somebody running beside me, pacing me through the brilliant blindness of the Cloud.</p>
    <p>I plunged out into the hall beyond. It was blue like still deep water, and empty. I ran. I didn't want to run. Some sane corner of my mind cried out to Shirina for help, but she couldn't get through the shrieking chaos of the rest of it. I ran.</p>
    <p>And somebody ran behind me. I didn't turn around. I didn't care.</p>
    <p>I hardly knew it. But somebody ran behind me, on long fleet legs.</p>
    <p>Down the blue hall, and into another one that was all flame-color shot with gray, and down that to a curving ramp cut from dark amber that dropped to the level below.</p>
    <p>The level where the X-crystals were.</p>
    <p>I rushed down the amber path, bounding like a stag with the hounds close behind, through a crystal silence that threw the sound of my breathing back at me, harsh and tearing. There was a circular place at the bottom of the ramp where four hallways met, a place jewel-carved in somber, depthless purple.</p>
    <p>I came into it, and from three of the hall mouths men stepped out to meet me. Men with young faces and snow-white hair, and naked bodies burning gold against the purple.</p>
    <p>I stopped in the center of the floor. I heard bare feet racing on the ramp behind me, and I knew without looking who it was.</p>
    <p>Flack. He circled and fixed me with his cold strange eyes, like moonlight in his dark face. Somewhere he had found a blaster.</p>
    <p>He held it on me. Not on my head or heart, but at my middle.</p>
    <p>"I thought you might blow your top, Stevie," he said. "So we kind of stood by, in case you'd try something."</p>
    <p>I stood still. I didn't have any feelings. I was beyond that. I was crazy—clean, stark crazy, thinking of time and the crystals pulsing just beyond my reach.</p>
    <p>"Get out of my way," I warned him.</p>
    <p>Flack smiled. There was no humor in it. The three men moved in a little behind him. They looked at Flack and they looked at me, and they didn't like any of it, but they were afraid.</p>
    <p>Afraid to die, like all of us. Even Flack, who never had a soul.</p>
    <p>Flack acted like someone being patient with a naughty child.</p>
    <p>"Will you come back with us, Stevie, or do I blow your insides out, here and now?" he asked me.</p>
    <p>I looked at his cold, queer eyes. "You'd like that."</p>
    <p>"Yeah." He ran the red tip of his tongue over his swollen lips. "Yeah. But I'm letting you choose."</p>
    <p>"All right," I said. "All right, I'll choose."</p>
    <p>I was crazy. I jumped him.</p>
    <p>I hit him first with my mind. Flack was strong, but I was fifty years older in the Cloud than he was, and Shirina had taught me things. I gathered all the force I had and let him have it, and he had to marshal his own thought-force to fight it off, so that for a second he couldn't manage the blaster with his conscious mind.</p>
    <p>Instinctive reflex sent a crimson stream of deadly power smoking past me when I dived in low. It seared my skin, but that was all.</p>
    <p>We fell, threshing, on the purple stone. Flack was strong. He was bigger than I, and heavier, and viciously mean. He beat most of the sense out of me, but I had caught his gun wrist and wouldn't let go. The three others took their golden auras back a little toward the hall mouths, afraid the blaster might let off and hit them.</p>
    <p>They thought Flack could handle me, and they were afraid. So they drew back and used their minds on me, trying to hammer me down.</p>
    <p>I don't know yet why they couldn't. I guess it was because of a lot of things, Shirina's teaching, my greater age, and the fact that I wasn't thinking consciously of anything. I was just a thing that had started some place and was going through.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I wish they had broken me. Sometimes I wish Flack had burned me down on the purple stone.</p>
    <p>I shook off their thought-blows, I took the pounding of Flack's big fist and the savaging of his feet and knees, and put all my strength into bending his arm. I yanked it away from me, and up and around where I wanted it.</p>
    <p>I got it there. He made his last play. He broke his heart on it, and it didn't do him any good. I saw his eyes, stretched wide in his dark face. I can still see them.</p>
    <p>I got my finger past his and pressed the firing stud.</p>
    <p>I got up and walked across the floor, carrying the blaster. The three others spread out, warily, ringing me. Naked men glowing gold against the purple stone, their eyes hard, animal-bright with fear.</p>
    <p>I blasted one through the head just as his muscles tensed for the leap. The others came in, fast. They knocked me down, and time was passing, and the people walking slowly under the crystals with dreams in their eyes.</p>
    <p>I kicked one man under the jaw and broke his neck, and the other tried to take the gun away. I had just come from the Cloud, and he hadn't. I was strong with the life that pulsed up from the X-crystals. I forced his arms back and pressed the stud again, trying not to see his eyes.</p>
    <p>And these were my friends. Men I drank and laughed with, and went with sometimes to worlds beyond this universe.</p>
    <p>I went on, down a hall the color of a Martian dawn. I was empty. I didn't feel or think. There was a pain a long way off, and blood in my mouth, but such things didn't matter.</p>
    <p>I came to the place where the crystals were and stopped.</p>
    <p>A lot of them had walked under the crystals. Almost half of the five hundred families from the Queen of Jupiter. They lay still on the black floor, and there was plenty of room. They didn't crowd the others coming after them, a slow, quiet stream of human beings with dreams in their eyes.</p>
    <p>The crystals hung in a wide circle, tilting slightly inward. They pulsed with a blackness that was beyond mere dark, a negative thing as blazing and tangible as sunlight. The angle of tilt and the tuning of the facets against one another made the difference in the result, whether projecting the Veil, or motive power, or hypnosis, or serving as a gateway to another time and space.</p>
    <p>Or sucking the power of life from human bodies.</p>
    <p>I could see the pale shimmer of force in the center, a sort of vortex between the limitless, burning, black facets that rose from the quiet bodies to the chamber of the Cloud above.</p>
    <p>I could see the faces of the dead. They were still smiling.</p>
    <p>The controls were on the other side. I ran. I was dead inside, as dead as the corpses on the floor, but I ran. I remember thinking it was funny to run when you were dead. I kept on the outside of the crystals and ran with all my strength to the controls.</p>
    <p>I saw Virgie. She was way back in the procession, and she was just as I knew she'd be, with Brad beside her and the green-eyed baby still in her arms, asleep.</p>
    <p>Virgie, with her gleaming red hair and Missy's eyes!</p>
    <p>I grabbed the controls and wrenched them over, and the shimmering vortex disappeared. I spun the great hexagonal wheel and notched it for full-power hypnosis, and ran out onto the floor, among the dead.</p>
    <p>I told the living what to do. I didn't waken them. They turned and went back the way they came, back toward the Queen of Jupiter, running hard and still smiling, still not afraid.</p>
    <p>I went back to the wheel and turned it again, to a notch marked in their danger-color, and then I followed the last of the humans into the hall. At the doorway I turned and raised my blaster.</p>
    <p>I saw Shirina standing under the radiant blackness of the crystals, halfway around the curving wall.</p>
    <p>I felt her mind touch mine, and then draw back, slowly, the way you take your hand away from someone you loved that has just died. I looked at her eyes. I had to.</p>
    <p>Why did I do what I did? What did I care about red hair and smoke-gray eyes, and the three-hundred-year diluted blood of a girl named Missy? I wasn't human any longer. What did I care?</p>
    <p>We were apart, Shirina and I. We had gone away from each other and we couldn't touch, even to say goodbye. I caught a faint echo of her thought.</p>
    <p>"Oh, Stevie, there were still so many things to do!"</p>
    <p>Her great luminous black eyes shining with tears, her jewel-tipped antennae dulled and drooping. And yet I knew what she was going to do.</p>
    <p>I couldn't see the crystals, suddenly. I couldn't see anything. I knew there was never going to be anything I wanted to see again. I raised the blaster and fired it full power into one of the hanging crystals, and then I ran.</p>
    <p>I felt the bolt of Shirina's lethal thought strike my brain, and weaken, and shatter on something in her own mind, at its source. I ran, a dead thing going on leaden feet, in a halo of golden light.</p>
    <p>Behind me the X-crystals, upset by the blaster in their fullest sympathy of power, began to split and crack and tear the world of Astellar to bits.</p>
    <p>I don't know much about what happened. I ran and ran, on the heels of the humans who still lived, but I was beyond thinking or feeling. I have vague memories of hallways lined with cells of jewel-toned crystal, halls of amber and amethyst and cinnabar, of dragon-green and gray the color of morning mist, and colors there are no names for in this dimension.</p>
    <p>Hallways that cracked and split behind me, falling in upon themselves, shards of broken rainbows. And above that the scream of power from the X-crystals, wrenching and tearing at Astellar.</p>
    <p>Then something I heard with my mind, and not my ears. Shirina's people, dying in the wreckage.</p>
    <p>My mind was stunned, but not stunned enough. I could still hear. I can still hear.</p>
    <p>The Queen of Jupiter was safe. The outward-moving vibration hadn't reached her yet. We got aboard her, and I opened the space doors and blasted her off myself, because the skipper and the first and second officers were asleep for good on Astellar.</p>
    <p>I didn't watch the death of Astellar. Only after a long time I looked back, and it was gone, and there was only a cloud of bright dust shimmering in the raw sunlight.</p>
    <p>I set the Iron Mike for Space Authority headquarters on Mars and turned on the automatic AC warning beam. Then I left the Queen of Jupiter in the Number 4 lifeboat, B deck.</p>
    <p>That's where I am now, writing this, somewhere between Mars and the Belt. I didn't see Virgie before I went. I didn't see any of them, but especially Virgie. They'll be awake now. I hope their lives are worth what they cost.</p>
    <p>Astellar is gone. The Veil is gone. You don't have to be afraid any more. I'm going to put this manuscript in a message rocket and send it on, so you'll know you don't have to fear. I don't know why I care.</p>
    <p>I don't know why I'm writing this at all, unless— Bosh, I know! Why lie? At this stage of the game, why lie?</p>
    <p>I'm alive now. I'm a young man. But the Cloud that kept me that way is gone, and presently I shall grow old, too old, very quickly, and die. And I'm afraid to die.</p>
    <p>Somewhere in the solar system there must be somebody willing to pray for me. They used to teach me, when I was a kid, that prayer helped. I want somebody to pray for my soul, because I can't do it for myself.</p>
    <p>If I were glad of what I've done, if I had changed, perhaps then I could pray.</p>
    <p>But I've gone beyond humanity, and I can't turn back.</p>
    <p>Maybe prayer doesn't matter. Maybe there's nothing beyond death but oblivion. I hope so! If I could only stop being, stop thinking, stop remembering.</p>
    <p>I hope to all the gods of all the universes that death is the end. But I don't know, and I'm afraid.</p>
    <p>Afraid. Judas—Judas—Judas! I betrayed two worlds, and there couldn't be a hell deeper than the one I live in now. And still I'm afraid.</p>
    <p>Why? Why should I care what happens to me? I destroyed Astellar. I destroyed Shirina, whom I loved better than anything in Creation. I destroyed my friends, my comrades—and I have destroyed myself.</p>
    <p>And you're not worth it. Not all the human cattle that breed in the solar system were worth Astellar, and Shirina, and the things we did beyond space and time, together.</p>
    <p>Why did I give Missy that locket?</p>
    <p>Why did I have to meet Virgie, with her red hair?</p>
    <p>Why did I remember? Why did I care? Why did I do what I did?</p>
    <p>Why was I ever born?</p>

    <p>The stranger was talking about him—the tall stranger who was a long way from his native uplands, who wore plain leather and did not belong in this swamp-coast village. He was asking questions, talking, watching.</p>
    <p>David Heath knew that, in the same detached way in which he realized that he was in Kalruna's dingy Palace of All Possible Delights, that he was very drunk but not nearly drunk enough, that he would never be drunk enough and that presently, when he passed out, he would be tossed over the back railing into the mud, where he might drown or sleep it off as he pleased.</p>
    <p>Heath did not care. The dead and the mad do not care. He lay without moving on the native hide-frame cot, the leather mask covering the lower part of his face, and breathed the warm golden vapor that bubbled in a narghile-like bowl beside him. Breathed, and tried to sleep, and could not. He did not close his eyes. Only when he became unconscious would he do that.</p>
    <p>There would be a moment he could not avoid, just before his drugged brain slipped over the edge into oblivion, when he would no longer be able to see anything but the haunted darkness of his own mind, and that moment would seem like all eternity. But afterward, for a few hours, he would find peace.</p>
    <p>Until then he would watch, from his dark corner, the life that went on in the Palace of All Possible Delights.</p>
    <p>Heath rolled his head slightly. By his shoulder, clinging with its hooked claws to the cot frame, a little bright-scaled dragon crouched and met his glance with jewel-red eyes in which there were peculiar sympathy and intelligence. Heath smiled and settled back. A nervous spasm shook him but the drug had relaxed him so that it was not severe and passed off quickly.</p>
    <p>No one came near him except the emerald-skinned girl from the deep swamps who replenished his bowl. She was not human and therefore did not mind that he was David Heath. It was as though there were a wall around him beyond which no man stepped or looked.</p>
    <p>Except, of course, the stranger.</p>
    <p>Heath let his gaze wander. Past the long low bar where the common seamen lay on cushions of moss and skins, drinking the cheap fiery thul. Past the tables, where the captains and the mates sat, playing their endless and complicated dice games. Past the Nahali girl who danced naked in the torchlight, her body glimmering with tiny scales and as sinuous and silent in motion as the body of a snake.</p>
    <p>The single huge room was open on three sides to the steaming night. It was there that Heath's gaze went at last. Outside, to the darkness and the sea, because they had been his life and he loved them.</p>
    <p>Darkness on Venus is not like the darkness of Earth or Mars. The planet is hungry for light and will not let it go. The face of Venus never sees the sun but even at night the hope and the memory of it are there, trapped in the eternal clouds.</p>
    <p>The air is the color of indigo and it carries its own pale glow. Heath lay watching how the slow hot wind made drifts of light among the liha-trees, touched the muddy harbor beaches with a wavering gleam and blended into the restless phosphorescence of the Sea of Morning Opals. Half a mile south the river Omaz flowed silently down, still tainted with the reek of the Deep Swamps.</p>
    <p>Sea and sky—the life of David Heath and his destruction.</p>
    <p>The heavy vapor swirled in Heath's brain. His breathing slowed and deepened. His lids grew heavy.</p>
    <p>Heath closed his eyes.</p>
    <p>An expression of excitement, of yearning, crossed his face, mingled with a vague unease. His muscles tensed. He began to whimper, very softly, the sound muffled by the leather mask.</p>
    <p>The little dragon cocked its head and watched, still as a carven image.</p>
    <p>Heath's body, half naked in a native kilt, began to twitch, then to move in spasmodic jerks. The expression of unease deepened, changed gradually to one of pure horror. The cords in his throat stood out like wires as he tried to cry out and could not. Sweat gathered in great beads on his skin.</p>
    <p>Suddenly the little dragon raised its wings and voiced a hissing scream.</p>
    <p>Heath's nightmare world rocked around him, riven with loud sounds. He was mad with fear, he was dying, vast striding shapes thronged toward him out of a shining mist. His body was shaken, cracking, frail bones bursting into powder, his heart tearing out of him, his brain a part of the mist, shining, burning. He tore the mask from his face and cried out a name, Ethne!, and sat up—and his eyes were wide open, blind and deep.</p>
    <p>Somewhere, far off, he heard thunder. The thunder spoke. It called his name. A new face pushed in past the phantoms of his dream. It swelled and blotted out the others. The face of the stranger from the High Plateaus. He saw every line of it, painted in fire upon his brain.</p>
    <p>The square jaw, hard mouth, nose curved like a falcon's beak, the scars wealed, white against white skin, eyes like moonstones, only hot, bright—the long silver hair piled high in the intricate tribal knot and secured with a warrior's golden chains.</p>
    <p>Hands shook him, slapped his face. The little dragon went on screaming and flapping, tethered by a short thong to the head of Heath's cot so that it could not tear out the eyes of the stranger.</p>
    <p>Heath caught his breath in a long shuddering sob and sprang.</p>
    <p>He would have killed the man who had robbed him of his little time of peace. He tried, in deadly silence, while the seamen and the masters and the mates and the dancing girls watched, not moving, sidelong out of their frightened, hateful eyes. But the Uplander was a big man, bigger than Heath in his best days had ever been. And presently Heath lay panting on the cot, a sick man, a man who was slowly dying and had no strength left.</p>
    <p>The stranger spoke. "It is said that you found the Moonfire."</p>
    <p>Heath stared at him with his dazed, drugged eyes and did not answer.</p>
    <p>"It is said that you are David Heath the Earthman, captain of the Ethne."</p>
    <p>Still Heath did not answer. The rusty torchlight flickered over him, painting highlight and shadow. He had always been a lean, wiry man. Now he was emaciated, the bones of his face showing terribly ridged and curved under the drawn skin. His black hair and unkempt beard were shot through with white.</p>
    <p>The Uplander studied Heath deliberately, contemptuously. He said, "I think they lie."</p>
    <p>Heath laughed. It was not a nice laugh.</p>
    <p>"Few men have ever reached the Moonfire," the Venusian said. "They were the strong ones, the men without fear."</p>
    <p>After a long while Heath whispered, "They were fools."</p>
    <p>He was not speaking to the Uplander. He had forgotten him. His dark mad gaze was fixed on something only he could see.</p>
    <p>"Their ships are rotting in the weed beds of the Upper Seas. The little dragons have picked their bones." Heath's voice was slow, harsh and toneless, wandering. "Beyond the Sea of Morning Opals, beyond the weeds and the Guardians, through the Dragon's Throat and still beyond—I've seen it, rising out of the mists, out of the Ocean-That-Is-Not-Water."</p>
    <p>A tremor shook him, twisting the gaunt bones of his body. He lifted his head, like a man straining to breathe, and the running torchlight brought his face clear of the shadows. In all the huge room there was not a sound, not a rustle, except for a small sharp gasp that ran through every mouth and then was silent.</p>
    <p>"The gods know where they are now, the strong brave men who went through the Moonfire. The gods know what they are now. Not human if they live at all."</p>
    <p>He stopped. A deep slow shudder went through him. He dropped his head. "I was only in the fringe of it. Only a little way."</p>
    <p>In the utter quiet the Uplander laughed. He said, "I think you lie."</p>
    <p>Heath did not raise his head nor move.</p>
    <p>The Venusian leaned over him, speaking loudly, so that even across the distance of drugs and madness the Earthman should hear.</p>
    <p>"You're like the others, the few who have come back. But they never lived a season out. They died or killed themselves. How long have you lived?"</p>
    <p>Presently he grasped the Earthman's shoulder and shook it roughly. "How long have you lived?" he shouted and the little dragon screamed, struggling against its thong.</p>
    <p>Heath moaned. "Through all hell," he whispered. "Forever."</p>
    <p>"Three seasons," said the Venusian. "Three seasons, and part of a fourth." He took his hand away from Heath and stepped back. "You never saw the Moonfire. You knew the custom, how the men who break the taboo must be treated until the punishment of the gods is finished."</p>
    <p>He kicked the bowl, breaking it, and the bubbling golden fluid spilled out across the floor in a pool of heady fragrance. "You wanted that, and you knew how to get it, for the rest of your sodden life."</p>
    <p>A low growl of anger rose in the Palace of All Possible Delights.</p>
    <p>Heath's blurred vision made out the squat fat bulk of Kalruna approaching. Even in the depths of his agony he laughed, weakly. For more than three seasons Kalruna had obeyed the traditional law. He had fed and made drunk the pariah who was sacred to the anger of the gods—the gods who guarded so jealously the secret of the Moonfire. Now Kalruna was full of doubt and very angry.</p>
    <p>Heath began to laugh aloud. The effects of his uncompleted jag were making him reckless and hysterical. He sat up on the cot and laughed in their faces.</p>
    <p>"I was only in the fringe." he said. "I'm not a god. I'm not even a man any more. But I can show you if you want to be shown."</p>
    <p>He pulled himself to his feet, and as he did so, in a motion as automatic as breathing, he loosed the little dragon and set it on his naked shoulder. He stood swaying a moment and then began to walk out across the room, slowly, uncertainly, but with his head stubbornly erect. The crowd drew apart to make a path for him and he walked along it in the silence, clothed in his few sad rags of dignity, until he came to the railing and stopped.</p>
    <p>"Put out the torches," he said. "All but one."</p>
    <p>Kalruna said hesitantly, "There's no need. I believe you."</p>
    <p>There was fear in the place now—fear, and fascination. Every man glanced sideways, looking for escape, but no one went away.</p>
    <p>Heath said again, "Put out the torches."</p>
    <p>The tall stranger reached out and doused the nearest one in its bucket, and presently in all that vast room there was darkness, except for one torch far in the back.</p>
    <p>Heath stood braced against the rail, staring out into the hot indigo night.</p>
    <p>The mists rose thick from the Sea of Morning Opals. They crept up out of the mud, and breathed in clouds from the swamps. The slow wind pushed them in long rolling drifts, blue-white and glimmering against the darker night.</p>
    <p>Heath looked hungrily into the mists. His head was thrown back, his whole body strained upward and presently he raised his arms in a gesture of terrible longing.</p>
    <p>"Ethne," he whispered. "Ethne."</p>
    <p>Almost imperceptibly, a change came over him. The weakness, the look of the sodden wreck, left him. He stood firm and straight, and the muscles rose coiled and beautiful on the long lean frame of his bones, alive with the tension of strength.</p>
    <p>His face had altered even more. There was a look of power on it. The dark eyes burned with deep fires, glowing with a light that was more than human, until it seemed that his whole head was crowned with a strange nimbus.</p>
    <p>For one short moment, the face of David Heath was the face of a god.</p>
    <p>"Ethne," he said.</p>
    <p>And she came.</p>
    <p>Out of the blue darkness, out of the mist, drifting tenuous and lovely toward the Earthman. Her body was made from the glowing air, the soft drops of the mist, shaped and colored by the force that was in Heath. She was young, not more than nineteen, with the rosy tint of Earth's sun still in her cheeks, her eyes wide and bright as a child's, her body slim with the sweet angularity of youth.</p>
    <p>The first time I saw her, when she stepped down the loading ramp for her first look at Venus and the wind took her hair and played with it and she walked light and eager as a colt on a spring morning. Light and merry always, even walking to her death.</p>
    <p>The shadowy figure smiled and held out her arms. Her face was the face of a woman who has found love and all the world along with it.</p>
    <p>Closer and closer she drifted to Heath and the Earthman stretched out his hands to touch her.</p>
    <p>And in one swift instant, she was gone.</p>
    <p>Heath fell forward against the rail. He stayed there a long time. There was no god in him now, no strength. He was like a flame suddenly burned out and dead, the ashes collapsing upon themselves. His eyes were closed and tears ran out from under the lashes.</p>
    <p>In the steaming darkness of the room no one moved.</p>
    <p>Heath spoke once. "I couldn't go far enough," he said, "into the Moonfire."</p>
    <p>He dragged himself upright after a while and went toward the steps, supporting himself against the rail, feeling his way like a blind man. He went down the four steps of hewn logs and the mud of the path rose warm around his ankles. He passed between the rows of mud-and-wattle huts, a broken scarecrow of a man plodding through the night of an alien world.</p>
    <p>He turned, down the side path that led to the anchorage. His feet slipped into the deeper mud at the side and he fell, face down. He tried once to get up, then lay still, already sinking into the black, rich ooze. The little dragon rode on his shoulder, pecking at him, screaming, but he did not hear.</p>
    <p>He did not know it when the tall stranger from the High Plateaus picked him out of the mud a few seconds later, dragon and all, and carried him away, down to the darkling sea.</p>

     <p>2: The Emerald Sail</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>A woman's voice said, "Give me the cup."</p>
    <p>Heath felt his head being lifted, and then the black, stinging taste of Venusian coffee slid like liquid fire down his throat. He made his usual waking fight against fear and reality, gasped and opened his eyes.</p>
    <p>He lay in his own bunk, in his own cabin, aboard the Ethne. Across from him, crouched on a carven chest, the tall Venusian sat, his head bowed under the low scarlet arch of the deck above. Beside Heath, looking down at him, was a woman.</p>
    <p>It was still night. The mud that clung to Heath's body was still wet. They must have worked hard, he thought, to bring him to.</p>
    <p>The little dragon flopped down to its perch on Heath's shoulder. He stroked its scaly neck and lay watching his visitors.</p>
    <p>The man said, "Can you talk now?"</p>
    <p>Heath shrugged. His eyes were on the woman. She was tall but not too tall, young but not too young. Her body was everything a woman's body ought to be, of its type, which was wide-shouldered and leggy, and she had a fine free way of moving it. She wore a short tunic of undyed spider silk, which exactly matched the soft curling hair that fell down her back—a bright, true silver with little peacock glints of color in it.</p>
    <p>Her face was one that no man would forget in a hurry. It was a face shaped warmly and generously for all the womanly things—passion and laughter and tenderness. But something had happened to it. Something had given it a bitter sulky look. There was resentment in it and deep anger and hardness—and yet, with all that, it was somehow a pathetically eager face with lost and frightened eyes.</p>
    <p>Heath remembered vaguely a day when he would have liked to solve the riddle of that contradictory face. A day long ago, before Ethne came.</p>
    <p>He said, speaking to both of them, "Who are you and what do you want with me?"</p>
    <p>He looked now directly at the man and it was a look of sheer black hatred. "Didn't you have enough fun with me at Kalruna's?"</p>
    <p>"I had to be sure of you," the stranger said. "Sure that you had not lied about the Moonfire."</p>
    <p>He leaned forward, his eyes narrowed and piercing. He did not sit easily. His body was curved like a bent bow. In the light of the hanging lantern his scarred, handsome face showed a ripple of little muscles under the skin. A man in a hurry, Heath thought, a man with a sharp goad pricking his flanks.</p>
    <p>"And what was that to you?" said Heath.</p>
    <p>It was a foolish question. Already Heath knew what was coming. His whole being drew in upon itself, retreated.</p>
    <p>The stranger did not answer directly. Instead he said, "You know the cult that calls itself guardian of the Mysteries of the Moon."</p>
    <p>"The oldest cult on Venus and one of the strongest. One of the strangest, too, on a moonless planet," Heath said slowly to no one in particular. "The Moonfire is their symbol of godhead."</p>
    <p>The woman laughed without mirth. "Although," she said, "they've never seen it."</p>
    <p>The stranger went on, "All Venus knows about you, David Heath. The word travels. The priests know too—the Children of the Moon. They have a special interest in you."</p>
    <p>Heath waited. He did not speak.</p>
    <p>"You belong to the gods for their own vengeance," the stranger said. "But the vengeance hasn't come. Perhaps because you're an Earthman and therefore less obedient to the gods of Venus. Anyway, the Children of the Moon are tired of waiting. The longer you live the more men may be tempted to blasphemy, the less faith there will be in the ability of the gods to punish men for their sins." His voice had a biting edge of sarcasm. "So," he finished, "the Children of the Moon are coming to see to it that you die."</p>
    <p>Heath smiled. "Do the priests tell you their secrets?"</p>
    <p>The man turned his head and said, "Alor."</p>
    <p>The woman stepped in front of Heath and loosed her tunic at the shoulder. "There," she said furiously. "Look!"</p>
    <p>Her anger was not with Heath. It was with what he saw. The tattoo branded between her white breasts—the round rayed symbol of the Moon.</p>
    <p>Heath caught his breath and let it out in a long sigh. "A handmaiden of the temple," he said and looked again at her face. Her eyes met his, silvery-cold, level, daring him to say more.</p>
    <p>"We are sold out of our cradles," she said. "We have no choice. And our families are very proud to have a daughter chosen for the temple."</p>
    <p>Bitterness and pride and the smoldering anger of the slave.</p>
    <p>She said, "Broca tells the truth."</p>
    <p>Heath's body seemed to tighten in upon itself. He glanced from one to the other and back again, not saying anything, and his heart beat fast and hard, knocking against his ribs.</p>
    <p>Alor said, "They will kill you and it won't be easy dying. I know. I've heard men screaming sometimes for many nights and their sin was less than yours."</p>
    <p>Heath said out of a dry mouth, "A runaway girl from the temple gardens and a thrower of spears. Their sin is great too. They didn't come halfway across Venus just to warn me. I think they lie. I think the priests are after them."</p>
    <p>"We're all three proscribed," said Broca, "but Alor and I could get away. You they'll hunt down no matter where you go—except one place."</p>
    <p>And Heath said, "Where is that?"</p>
    <p>"The Moonfire."</p>
    <p>After a long while Heath uttered a harsh grating sound that might have been a laugh.</p>
    <p>"Get out," he said. "Get away from me."</p>
    <p>He got to his feet, shaking with weakness and fury. "You lie, both of you—because I'm the only living man who has seen the Moonfire and you want me to take you there. You believe the legends. You think the Moonfire will change you into gods. You're mad, like all the other fools, for the power and the glory you think you'll have. Well, I can tell you this—the Moonfire will give you nothing but suffering and death."</p>
    <p>His voice rose. "Go lie to someone else. Frighten the Guardians of the Upper Seas. Bribe the gods themselves to take you there. But get away from me!"</p>
    <p>The Venusian rose slowly. The cabin was small for him, the deck beams riding his shoulders. He swept the little dragon aside. He took Heath in his two hands and he said, "I will reach the Moonfire, and you will take me there."</p>
    <p>Heath struck him across the face.</p>
    <p>Sheer astonishment held Broca still for a moment and Heath said, "You're not a god yet."</p>
    <p>The Venusian opened his mouth in a snarling grin. His hands shifted and tightened.</p>
    <p>The woman said sharply, "Broca!" She stepped in close, wrenching at Broca's wrists. "Don't kill him, you fool!"</p>
    <p>Broca let his breath out hard between his teeth. Gradually his hands relaxed. Heath's face was suffused with dark blood. He would have fallen if the woman had not caught him.</p>
    <p>She said to Broca, "Strike him—but not too hard."</p>
    <p>Broca raised his fist and struck Heath carefully on the point of the jaw.</p>
    <p>It could not have been more than two of the long Venusian hours before Heath came to. He did that slowly as always—progressing from a vast vague wretchedness to an acute awareness of everything that was the matter with him. His head felt as though it had been cleft in two with an axe from the jaw upward.</p>
    <p>He could not understand why he should have wakened. The drug alone should have been good for hours of heavy sleep. The sky beyond the cabin port had changed. The night was almost over. He lay for a moment, wondering whether or not he was going to be sick, and then suddenly he realized what had wakened him in spite of everything.</p>
    <p>The Ethne was under way.</p>
    <p>His anger choked him so that he could not even swear. He dragged himself to his feet and crossed the cabin, feeling even then that she was not going right, that the dawn wind was strong and she was rolling to it, yawing.</p>
    <p>He kicked open the door and came out on deck.</p>
    <p>The great lateen sail of golden spider silk, ghostly in the blue air, slatted and spilled wind, shaking against loose yards. Heath turned and made for the raised poop, finding strength in his fear for the ship. Broca was up there, braced against the loom of the stern sweep. The wake lay white on the black water, twisting like a snake.</p>
    <p>The woman Alor stood at the rail, staring at the low land that lay behind them.</p>
    <p>Broca made no protest as Heath knocked him aside and took the sweep. Alor turned and watched but did not speak.</p>
    <p>The Ethne was small and the simple rig was such that one man could handle it. Heath trimmed the sail and in a few seconds she was stepping light and dainty as her namesake, her wake straight as a ruled line.</p>
    <p>When that was done Heath turned upon them and cursed them in a fury greater than that of a woman whose child has been stolen.</p>
    <p>Broca ignored him. He stood watching the land and the lightening sky. When Heath was all through the woman said, "We had to go. It may already be too late. And you weren't going to help."</p>
    <p>Heath didn't say anything more. There weren't any words. He swung the helm hard over.</p>
    <p>Broca was beside him in one step, his hand raised and then suddenly Alor cried out, "Wait!"</p>
    <p>Something in her voice brought both men around to look at her. She stood at the rail, facing into the wind, her hair flying, the short skirt of her tunic whipped back against her thighs. Her arm was raised in a pointing gesture.</p>
    <p>It was dawn now.</p>
    <p>For a moment Heath lost all sense of time. The deck lifting lightly under his feet, the low mist and dawn over the Sea of Morning Opals, the dawn that gave the sea its name. It seemed that there had never been a Moonfire, never been a past or a future, but only David Heath and his ship and the light coming over the water.</p>
    <p>It came slowly, sifting down like a rain of jewels through the miles of pearl-gray cloud. Cool and slow at first, then warming and spreading, turning the misty air to drops of rosy fire, opaline, glowing, low to the water, so that the little ship seemed to be drifting through the heart of a fire-opal as vast as the universe.</p>
    <p>The sea turned color, from black to indigo streaked with milky bands. Flights of the small bright dragons rose flashing from the weed-beds that lay scattered on the surface in careless patterns of purple and ochre and cinnabar and the weed itself stirred with dim sentient life, lifting its tendrils to the light.</p>
    <p>For one short moment David Heath was completely happy.</p>
    <p>Then he saw that Broca had caught up a bow from under the taffrail. Heath realized that they must have fetched all their traps coolly aboard while he was in Kalruna's. It was one of the great longbows of the Upland barbarians and Broca bent its massive arc as though it had been a twig and laid across it a bone-barbed shaft.</p>
    <p>A ship was coming toward them, a slender shape of pearl flying through the softly burning veils of mist. Her sail was emerald green. She was a long way off but she had the wind behind her and she was coming down with it like a swooping dragon.</p>
    <p>"That's the Lahal," said Heath. "What does Johor think he's doing?"</p>
    <p>Then he saw, with a start of incredulous horror, that on the prow of the oncoming ship the great spiked ram had been lowered into place.</p>
    <p>During the moment when Heath's brain struggled to understand why Johor, ordinary trading skipper of an ordinary ship, should wish to sink him, Alor said five words.</p>
    <p>"The Children of the Moon."</p>
    <p>Now, on the Lahal's foredeck, Heath could distinguish four tiny figures dressed in black.</p>
    <p>The long shining ram dipped and glittered in the dawn.</p>
    <p>Heath flung himself against the stern sweep. The Ethne's golden sail cracked taut. She headed up into the wind. Heath measured his distance grimly and settled down.</p>
    <p>Broca turned on him furiously. "Are you mad? They'll run us down! Go the other way."</p>
    <p>Heath said, "There is no other way. They've got me pinned on a lee shore." He was suddenly full of a blind rage against Johor and the four black-clad priests.</p>
    <p>There was nothing to do but wait—wait and sail the heart out of his ship and hope that enough of David Heath still lived to get them through. And if not, Heath thought, I'll take the Lahal down with me!</p>
    <p>Broca and Alor stood by the rail together, watching the racing green sail. They did not speak. There was nothing to say. Heath saw that now and again the woman turned to study him.</p>
    <p>The wakes of the two ships lay white on the water, two legs of a triangle rushing toward their apex.</p>
    <p>Heath could see Johor now, manning the sweep. He could see the crew crouching in the waist, frightened sailors rounded up to do the bidding of the priests. They were armed and standing by with grapnels.</p>
    <p>Now, on the foredeck, he could see the Children of the Moon.</p>
    <p>They were tall men. They wore tunics of black link mail with the rayed symbol of the Moon blazed in jewels on their breasts. They rode the pitching deck, their silver hair flying loose in the wind, and their bodies were as the bodies of wolves that run down their prey and devour it.</p>
    <p>Heath fought the stern sweep, fought the straining ship, fought with wind and distance to cheat them of their will.</p>
    <p>And the woman Alor kept watching David Heath with her bitter challenging eyes and Heath hated her as he did the priests, with a deadly hatred, because he knew what he must look like with his beaked bony face and wasted body, swaying and shivering over the loom of the sweep.</p>
    <p>Closer and closer swept the emerald sail, rounded and gleaming like a peacock's breast in the light. Pearl white and emerald, purple and gold, on a dark blue sea, the spiked ram glittering—two bright dragons racing toward marriage, toward death.</p>
    <p>Close, very close. The rayed symbols blazed fire on the breasts of the Children of the Moon.</p>
    <p>The woman Alor lifted her head high into the wind and cried out—a long harsh ringing cry like the scream of an eagle. It ended in a name, and she spoke it like a curse.</p>
    <p>"Vakor!"</p>
    <p>One of the priests wore the jeweled fillet that marked him leader. He flung up his arms, and the words of his malediction came hot and bitter down the wind.</p>
    <p>Broca's bowstring thrummed like a great harp. The shaft fell short and Vakor laughed.</p>
    <p>The priests went aft to be safe from buckling timbers and the faces of the seamen were full of fear.</p>
    <p>Heath cried out a warning. He saw Alor and Broca drop flat to the deck. He saw their faces. They were the faces of a man and a woman who were on the point of death and did not like it but were not afraid. Broca reached out and braced the woman's body with his own.</p>
    <p>Heath shoved Ethne's nose fair into the wind and let her jibe.</p>
    <p>The Lahal went thundering by not three yards away, helpless to do anything about it.</p>
    <p>The kicking sweep had knocked Heath into the scuppers, half dazed. He heard the booming sail slat over, felt the wrenching shudder that shook the Ethne down to her last spike and prayed that the mast would stay in her. As he dragged himself back he saw that the priest Vakor had leaped onto the Lahal's high stern. He was close enough for Heath to see his face.</p>
    <p>They looked into each other's eyes and the eyes of Vakor were brilliant and wild, the eyes of a fanatic. He was not old. His body was virile and strong, his face cut in fine sweeping lines, the mouth full and sensuous and proud. He was tense with cheated fury and his voice rang against the wind like the howling of a beast.</p>
    <p>"We will follow! We will follow, and the gods will slay!"</p>
    <p>As the rush of the Lahal carried him away, Heath heard the last echo of his cry.</p>
    <p>"Alor!"</p>
    <p>With all the strength he had left Heath quieted his outraged ship and let her fall away on the starboard tack. Broca and Alor got slowly to their feet. Broca said, "I thought you'd wrecked her."</p>
    <p>"They had the wind of me," Heath said. "I couldn't come about like a Christian."</p>
    <p>Alor walked to the stern and watched where the Lahal wallowed and staggered as she tried to stop her headlong rush. "Vakor!" she whispered, and spat into the sea.</p>
    <p>Broca said, "They will follow us. Alor told me—they have a chart, the only one that shows the way to the Moonfire."</p>
    <p>Heath shrugged. He was too weary now to care. He pointed off to the right.</p>
    <p>"There's a strong ocean current runs there, like a river in the sea. Most skippers are afraid of it but their ships aren't like the Ethne. We'll ride it. After that we'll have to trust to luck."</p>
    <p>Alor swung around sharply. "Then you will go to the Moonfire."</p>
    <p>"I didn't say that. Broca, get me the bottle out of my cabin locker."</p>
    <p>But it was the woman who fetched it to him and watched him drink, then said, "Are you all right?"</p>
    <p>"I'm dying, and she asks me that," said Heath.</p>
    <p>She looked a moment steadily into his eyes and oddly enough there was no mockery in her voice when she spoke, only respect.</p>
    <p>"You won't die," she said and went away.</p>
    <p>In a few moments the current took the Ethne and swept her away northward. The Lahal vanished into the mists behind them. She was cranky in close handling and Heath knew that Johor would not dare the swirling current.</p>
    <p>For nearly three hours he stayed at his post and took the ship through. When the ocean stream curved east he rode out of it into still water. Then he fell down on the deck and slept.</p>
    <p>Once again the tall barbarian lifted him like a child and laid him in his bunk.</p>
    <p>All through the rest of that day and the long Venusian night, while Broca steered, Heath lay in bitter sleep. Alor sat beside him, watching the nightmare shadows that crossed his face, listening as he moaned and talked, soothing his worst tremors.</p>
    <p>He repeated the name of Ethne over and over again and a puzzled strangely wistful look came in the eyes of Alor.</p>
    <p>When it was dawn again Heath awoke and went on deck. Broca said with barbarian bluntness, "Have you decided?"</p>
    <p>Heath did not answer and Alor said, "Vakor will hunt you down. The word has gone out all over Venus, wherever there are men. There'll be no refuge for you—except one."</p>
    <p>Heath smiled, a mirthless baring of the teeth. "And that's the Moonfire. You make it all so simple."</p>
    <p>And yet he knew she spoke the truth. The Children of the Moon would never leave his track. He was a rat in a maze and every passage led to death.</p>
    <p>But there were different deaths. If he had to die it would not be as Vakor willed but with Ethne—an Ethne more real than a shadow—in his arms again.</p>
    <p>He realized now that deep in his mind he had always known, all these three seasons and more that he had clung to a life not worth the living. He had known that someday he must go back again.</p>
    <p>"We'll go to the Moonfire," he said, "and perhaps we shall all be gods."</p>
    <p>Broca said, "You are weak, Earthman. You didn't have the courage."</p>
    <p>Heath said one word.</p>
    <p>"Wait."</p>

     <p>3: Over the Bar</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>The days and the nights went by, and the Ethne fled north across the Sea of Morning Opals, north toward the equator. They were far out of the trade lanes. All these vast upper reaches were wilderness. There were not even fishing villages along the coast. The great cliffs rose sheer from the water and nothing could find a foothold there. And beyond, past the Dragon's Throat, lay only the barren death-trap of the Upper Seas.</p>
    <p>The Ethne ran as sweetly as though she joyed to be free again, free of the muddy harbor and the chains. And a change came over Heath. He was a man again. He stood shaved and clean and erect on his own deck and there was no decision to be made anymore, no doubt. The long dread, the long delay, were over and he too, in his own bitter way, was happy.</p>
    <p>They had seen nothing more of the Lahal but Heath knew quite well that she was there somewhere, following. She was not as fleet as the Ethne but she was sound and Johor was a good sailor. Moreover, the priest Vakor was there and he would drive the Lahal over the Mountains of White Cloud if he had to—to catch them.</p>
    <p>He said once to Alor, "Vakor seems to have a special hatred for you."</p>
    <p>Her face twisted with revulsion and remembered shame. "He is a beast," she said. "He is a serpent, a lizard that walks like a king." She added, "We've made it easy for him, the three of us together like this."</p>
    <p>From where he sat steering Heath looked at her with a remote curiosity. She stood, long legged, bold-mouthed, looking back with somber smoky eyes at the white wake unrolling behind them.</p>
    <p>He said, "You must have loved Broca to break your vows for him. Considering what it means if they catch you."</p>
    <p>Alor looked at him, then laughed, a brief sound that had no humor in it.</p>
    <p>"I'd have gone with any man strong enough to take me out of the temple," she said. "And Broca is strong and he worships me."</p>
    <p>Heath was genuinely astonished. "You don't love him?"</p>
    <p>She shrugged. "He is good to look at. He is a chief of warriors and he is a man and not a priest. But love—"</p>
    <p>She asked suddenly, "What is it like—to love as you loved your Ethne?"</p>
    <p>Heath started. "What do you know about Ethne?" he asked harshly.</p>
    <p>"You have talked of her in sleep. And Broca told me how you called her shadow in Kalruna's place. You dared the Moonfire to gain her back."</p>
    <p>She glanced at the ivory figurehead on the high curving bow, the image of a woman, young and slim and smiling.</p>
    <p>"I think you are a fool," she said abruptly. "I think only a fool would love a shadow."</p>
    <p>She had left him and gone down into the cabin before he could gather words, before he could take her white neck between his hands and break it.</p>
    <p>Ethne—Ethne!</p>
    <p>He cursed the woman of the temple gardens.</p>
    <p>He was still in a brooding fury when Broca came up out of the cabin to relieve him at the sweep.</p>
    <p>"I'll steer a while yet," Heath told him curtly. "I think the weather's going to break."</p>
    <p>Clouds were boiling up in the south as the night closed down. The sea was running in long easy swells as it had done for all these days but there was a difference, a pulse and a stir that quivered all through the ship's keel.</p>
    <p>Broca, stretching huge shoulders, looked away to the south and then down at Heath.</p>
    <p>"I think you talk too much to my woman," he said.</p>
    <p>Before Heath could answer the other laid his hand lightly on the Earthman's shoulder. A light grip but with strength enough behind it to crack Heath's bones.</p>
    <p>He said, "Do not talk so much to Alor."</p>
    <p>"I haven't sought her out," Heath snapped savagely. "She's your woman—you worry about her."</p>
    <p>"I am not worried about her," Broca answered calmly. "Not about her and you."</p>
    <p>He was looking down at Heath as he spoke and Heath knew the contrast they made—his own lean body and gaunt face against the big barbarian's magnificent strength.</p>
    <p>"But she is always with you on the deck, listening to your stories of the sea," said Broca. "Do not talk to her so much," he repeated and this time there was an edge to his voice.</p>
    <p>"For heaven's sake!" said Heath jeeringly. "If I'm a fool what are you? A man mad enough to look for power in the Moonfire and faithfulness in a temple wench! And now you're jealous."</p>
    <p>He hated both Broca and Alor bitterly in this moment and out of his hate he spoke.</p>
    <p>"Wait until the Moonfire touches you. It will break your strength and your pride. After that you won't care who your woman talks to or where."</p>
    <p>Broca gave him a stare of unmoved contempt. Then he turned his back and settled down to look out across the darkening sea.</p>
    <p>After a while, the amusing side of the whole thing struck Heath, and he began to laugh.</p>
    <p>They were, all three of them, going to die. Somewhere out there to the south, Vakor came like a black shepherd, driving them toward death. Dreams of empire, dreams of glory and a voyage that tempted the vengeance of the gods—and at such a time the barbarian chief could be jealous.</p>
    <p>With sudden shock he realized just how much time Alor had spent with him. Out of habit and custom as old as the sea he had helped to while away the long hard hours with a sailor's yarns. Looking back he could see Alor's face, strangely young and eager as she listened, could remember how she asked questions and wanted to learn the ways and the working of the ship.</p>
    <p>He could remember now how beautiful she looked with the wind in her hair, her firm strong body holding the Ethne steady in a quartering sea.</p>
    <p>The storm brewed over the hours and at last it broke. Heath had known that the Sea of Morning Opals would not let him go without a struggle. It had tried him with shallows, with shifting reefs, with dead calms and booming solar tides and all the devices of current, fog and drifting weed. He had beaten all of them. Now he was almost within sight of the Dragon's Throat, the gateway to the Upper Seas and it was a murderous moment for a storm out of the south.</p>
    <p>The night had turned black. The sea burned with white phosphorescence, a boiling cauldron of witch-fire. The wind was frightening. The Ethne plunged and staggered, driving under a bare pole, and for once Heath was glad of Broca's strength as they fought the sweep together.</p>
    <p>He became aware that someone was beside him and knew that it was Alor.</p>
    <p>"Go below!" he yelled and caught only the echo of her answer. She did not go but threw her weight too against the sweep.</p>
    <p>Lightning bolts as broad as comet's tails came streaking down with a rush and a fury as though they had started their run from another star and gathered speed across half the galaxy. They lit the Sea of Morning Opals with a purple glare until the thunder brought the darkness crashing down again. Then the rain fell like a river rolling down the belts of cloud.</p>
    <p>Heath groaned inwardly. The wind and the following sea had taken the little ship between them and were hurling her forward. At the speed she was making now she would hit the Dragon's Throat at dawn. She would hit it full tilt and helpless as a drifting chip.</p>
    <p>The lightning showed him the barbarian's great straining body, gleaming wet, his long hair torn loose from its knots and chains, streaming with wind and water. It showed him Alor too. Their hands and their shoulders touched, straining together.</p>
    <p>It seemed that they struggled on that way for centuries and then, abruptly, the rain stopped, the wind slackened, and there was a period of eerie silence. Alor's voice sounded loud in Heath's ears, crying, "Is it over?"</p>
    <p>"No," he answered. "Listen!"</p>
    <p>They heard a deep and steady booming, distant in the north—the boom of surf.</p>
    <p>The storm began again.</p>
    <p>Dawn came, hardly lighter than the night. Through the flying wrack Heath could see cliffs on either side where the mountain ranges narrowed in, funneling the Sea of Morning Opals into the strait of the Dragon's Throat. The driven sea ran high between them, bursting white against the black rock.</p>
    <p>The Ethne was carried headlong, a leaf in a millrace.</p>
    <p>The cliffs drew in and in until there was a gap of no more than a mile between them. Black brooding titans and the space below a fury of white water, torn and shredded by fang-like rocks.</p>
    <p>The Dragon's Throat.</p>
    <p>When he had made the passage before Heath had had fair weather and men for the oars. Even then it had not been easy. Now he tried to remember where the channel lay, tried to force the ship toward what seemed to be an open lane among the rocks.</p>
    <p>The Ethne gathered speed and shot forward into the Dragon's Throat.</p>
    <p>She fled through a blind insanity of spray and wind and sound. Time and again Heath saw the loom of a towering rock before him and wrenched the ship aside or fought to keep away from death that was hidden just under the boiling surface. Twice, three times, the Ethne gave a grating shudder and he thought she was gone.</p>
    <p>Once, toward the last, when it seemed that there was no hope, he felt Alor's hand close over his.</p>
    <p>The high water saved them, catching them in its own rush down the channel, carrying them over the rocks and finally over the bar at the end of the gut. The Ethne came staggering out into the relative quiet of the Upper Seas, where the pounding waves seemed gentle and it was all done so quickly, over so soon. For a long time the three of them stood sagging over the sweep, not able to realize that it was over and they still lived.</p>
    <p>The storm spent itself. The wind settled to a steady blow. Heath got a rag of sail up. Then he sat down by the tiller and bowed his head over his knees and thought about how Alor had caught his hand when she believed she was going to die.</p>

     <p>4: "I Will Wait!"</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Even this early it was hot. The Upper Seas sprawled along the equator, shallow landlocked waters choked with weed and fouled with shifting reefs of mud, cut into a maze of lakes and blind channels by the jutting headlands of the mountains.</p>
    <p>The wind dropped to a flat calm. They left the open water behind them, where it was swept clean by the tides from the Sea of Morning Opals. The floating weed thickened around them, a blotched ochre plain that stirred with its own dim mindless life. The air smelled rotten.</p>
    <p>Under Heath's direction they swung the weed-knife into place, the great braced blade that fitted over the prow. Then, using the heavy sweep as a sculling oar, they began to push the Ethne forward by the strength of their sweating backs.</p>
    <p>Clouds of the little bright-scaled dragons rose with hissing screams, disturbed by the ship. This was their breeding ground. They fought and nested in the weed and the steaming air was full of the sound of their wings. They perched on the rail and in the rigging, watching with their red eyes. The creature that rode Heath's shoulder emitted harsh cries of excitement. Heath tossed him into the air and he flew away to join his mates.</p>
    <p>There was life under the weed, spawning in the hot stagnant waters, multiform and formless, swarming, endlessly hungry. Small reptilian creatures flopped and slithered through the weed, eating the dragon's eggs, and here and there a flat dark head would break through with a snap and a crunch, and it would watch the Ethne with incurious eyes while it chewed and swallowed.</p>
    <p>Constantly Heath kept watch.</p>
    <p>The sun rose high above the eternal clouds. The heat seeped down and gathered. The scull moved back and forth, the knife bit, the weed dragged against the hull and behind them the cut closed slowly as the stuff wrapped and coiled upon itself.</p>
    <p>Heath's eyes kept turning to Alor.</p>
    <p>He did not want to look at her. He did not wish to remember the touch of her hand on his. He wished only to remember Ethne, to remember the agony of the Moonfire and to think of the reward that lay beyond it if he could endure. What could a temple wench mean to him beside that?</p>
    <p>But he kept looking at her covertly. Her white limbs glistened with sweat and her red mouth was sullen with weariness and even so there was a strange wild beauty about her. Time and again her gaze would meet his, a quick hungry glance from under her lashes, and her eyes were not the eyes of a temple wench. Heath cursed Broca in his heart for making him think of Alor and he cursed himself because now he could not stop thinking of her.</p>
    <p>They toiled until they could not stand. Then they sprawled on the deck in the breathless heat to rest. Broca pulled Alor to him.</p>
    <p>"Soon this will all be over," he said. "Soon we will reach the Moonfire. You will like that, Alor—to be mated to a god!"</p>
    <p>She lay unresponsive in the circle of his arm, her head turned away. She did not answer.</p>
    <p>Broca laughed. "God and goddess. Two of a kind as we are now. We'll build our thrones so high the sun can see them." He rolled her head on his shoulder, looking down intently into her face. "Power, Alor. Strength. We will have them together." He covered her mouth with his, and his free hand caressed her, deliberate, possessive.</p>
    <p>She thrust him away. "Don't," she said angrily. "It's too hot and I'm too tired." She got up and walked to the side, standing with her back to Broca.</p>
    <p>Broca looked at her. Then he turned and looked at Heath. A dark flush reddened his skin. He said slowly, "Too hot and too tired—and besides, the Earthman is watching."</p>
    <p>He sprang up and caught Alor and swung her around, one huge hand tangled in her hair, holding her. As soon as he touched her Heath also sprang up and said harshly, "Let her alone!"</p>
    <p>Broca said, "She is my mate but I may not touch her." He glared down into Alor's blazing eyes and said, "She is my mate—or isn't she?"</p>
    <p>He flung her away. He turned his head from side to side, half blind with rage.</p>
    <p>"Do you think I didn't see you?" he asked thickly. "All day, looking at each other."</p>
    <p>Heath said, "You're crazy."</p>
    <p>"Yes," answered Broca, "I am." He took two steps toward Heath and added, "Crazy enough to kill you."</p>
    <p>Alor said, "If you do you'll never reach the Moonfire."</p>
    <p>Broca paused, trapped for one moment between his passion and his dream. He was facing the stern. Something caused his gaze to waver from Heath and then, gradually, his expression changed. Heath swung around and Alor gave a smothered cry.</p>
    <p>Far behind them, vague in the steaming air, was an emerald sail.</p>
    <p>The Lahal must have come through the Dragon's Throat as soon as the storm was over. With men to man the rowing benches she had gained on the Ethne during the calm. Now she too was in the weed, and the oars were useless but there were men to scull her. She would move faster than the Ethne and without pause.</p>
    <p>There would be little rest for Heath and Broca and the woman.</p>
    <p>They swayed at the sculling oar all the stifling afternoon and all the breathless night, falling into the dull, half-hypnotized rhythm of beasts who walk forever around a water-wheel. Two of them working always, while the third slept, and Broca never took his eyes from Alor. With his tremendous vitality it seemed that he never slept and during the periods when Heath and Alor were alone at the oar together they exchanged neither words nor glances.</p>
    <p>At dawn they saw that the Lahal was closer.</p>
    <p>Broca crouched on the deck. He lifted his head and looked at the green sail. Heath saw that his eyes were very bright and that he shivered in spite of the brooding heat.</p>
    <p>Heath's heart sank. The Upper Seas were rank with fever, and it looked as though the big barbarian was in for a bad go of it. Heath himself was pretty well immune to it but Broca was used to the clean air of the High Plateaus and the poison was working in his blood.</p>
    <p>He measured the speed of the two ships and said, "It's no use. We must stand and fight."</p>
    <p>Heath said savagely, "I thought you wanted to find the Moonfire. I thought you were the strong man who could win through it where everybody else has failed. I thought you were going to be a god."</p>
    <p>Broca got to his feet. "With fever or without it I'm a better man than you."</p>
    <p>"Then work! If we can just keep ahead of them until we clear the weed—"</p>
    <p>Broca said, "The Moonfire?"</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>"We will keep ahead."</p>
    <p>He bent his back to the scull and the Ethne crept forward through the weed. Her golden sail hung from the yard with a terrible stillness. The heat pressed down upon the Upper Seas as though the sun itself were falling through the haze. Astern the Lahal moved steadily on.</p>
    <p>Broca's fever mounted. He turned from time to time to curse Vakor, shouting at the emerald sail.</p>
    <p>"You'll never catch us, priest!" he would cry. "I am Broca of the tribe of Sarn and I will beat you—and I will beat the Moonfire. You will lie on your belly, priest, and lick my sandals before you die." Then he would turn to Alor, his eyes shining. "You know the legends, Alor! The man who can bathe in the heart of the Moonfire has the power of the High Ones. He can build a world to suit himself, he can be king and lord and master. He can give his woman-god a palace of diamonds with a floor of gold. That is true, Alor. You have heard the priests say it in the temple."</p>
    <p>Alor answered, "It is true."</p>
    <p>"A new world, Alor. A world of our own."</p>
    <p>He made the great sweep swing in a frenzy of strength and once again the mystery of the Moonfire swept over Heath. Why, since the priests knew the way there, did they not themselves become gods. Why had no man ever come out of it with godhead—only a few, a handful like himself, who had not had the valor to go all the way in.</p>
    <p>And yet there was godhead there. He knew because within himself there was the shadow of it.</p>
    <p>The endless day wore on. The emerald sail came closer.</p>
    <p>Toward mid-afternoon there was a sudden clattering flight of the little dragons and all life stopped still in the weed. The reptilian creatures lay motionless with dragon's eggs unbroken in their jaws. No head broke the surface to feed. The dragons flew away in a hissing cloud. There was utter silence.</p>
    <p>Heath flung himself against the sweep and stopped it.</p>
    <p>"Be quiet," he said. "Look. Out there."</p>
    <p>They followed his gesture. Far away over the port bow, flowing toward them, was a ripple in the weed. A ripple as though the very bed of the Upper Seas was in motion.</p>
    <p>"What is it?" whispered Alor, and saw Heath's face, and was silent.</p>
    <p>Sluggishly, yet with frightening speed, the ripple came toward them. Heath got a harpoon out of the stern locker. He watched the motion of the weed, saw it gradually slow and stop in a puzzled way. Then he threw the harpoon as far away from the ship as he could with all his strength and more.</p>
    <p>The ripple began again. It swerved and sped toward where the harpoon had fallen.</p>
    <p>"They'll attack anything that moves," said Heath. "It lost us because we stopped. Watch."</p>
    <p>The weed heaved and burst open, its meshes snapping across a scaled and titanic back. There seemed to be no shape to the creature, no distinguishable head. It was simply a vast and hungry blackness that spread upward and outward and the luckless brutes that cowered near it hissed and thrashed in their efforts to escape, and were engulfed and vanished.</p>
    <p>Again Alor whispered, "What is it?"</p>
    <p>"One of the Guardians," Heath answered. "The Guardians of the Upper Seas. They will crush a moving ship to splinters and eat the crew."</p>
    <p>He glanced back at the Lahal. She, too, had come to a dead stop. The canny Vakor had scented the danger also.</p>
    <p>"We'll have to wait," said Heath, "until it goes away."</p>
    <p>They waited. The huge shape of darkness sucked and floundered in the weed and was in no hurry to go.</p>
    <p>Broca sat staring at Heath. He was deep in fever and his eyes were not sane. He began to mutter to himself, incoherent ramblings in which only the name Alor and the word Moonfire were distinguishable.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, with startling clarity, he said, "The Moonfire is nothing without Alor."</p>
    <p>He repeated "Nothing!" several times, beating his huge fists on his knees each time he said it. Then he turned his head blindly from side to side as though looking for something. "She's gone. Alor's gone. She's gone to the Earthman."</p>
    <p>Alor spoke to him, touched him, but he shook her off. In his fever-mad brain there was only one truth. He rose and went toward David Heath.</p>
    <p>Heath got up. "Broca!" he said. "Alor is there beside you. She hasn't gone!"</p>
    <p>Broca did not hear. He did not stop.</p>
    <p>Alor cried out, "Broca!"</p>
    <p>"No," said Broca. "You love him. You're not mine anymore. When you look at me I am nothing. Your lips have no warmth in them." He reached out toward David Heath and he was blind and deaf to everything but the life that was in him to be torn out and trampled upon and destroyed.</p>
    <p>In the cramped space of the afterdeck there was not much room to move. Heath did not want to fight. He tried to dodge the sick giant but Broca pinned him against the rail. Fever or no fever, Heath had to fight him and it was not much use. Broca was beyond feeling pain.</p>
    <p>His sheer weight crushed Heath against the rail, bent his spine almost to breaking and his hands found Heath's throat. Heath struck and struck again and wondered if he had come all this way to die in a senseless quarrel over a woman.</p>
    <p>Abruptly he realized that Broca was letting go, was sliding down against him to the deck. Through a swimming haze he saw Alor standing there with a belaying pin in her hand. He began to tremble, partly with reaction but mostly with fury that he should have needed a woman's help to save his life. Broca lay still, breathing heavily.</p>
    <p>"Thanks," said Heath curtly. "Too bad you had to hit him. He didn't know what he was doing."</p>
    <p>Alor said levelly, "Didn't he?"</p>
    <p>Heath did not answer. He started to turn away and she caught him, forcing him to look at her.</p>
    <p>"Very likely I will die in the Moonfire," she said. "I haven't the faith in my strength that Broca has. So I'm going to say this now—I love you, David Heath. I don't care what you think or what you do about it but I love you."</p>
    <p>Her eyes searched his face, as though she wanted to remember every line and plane of it. Then she kissed him and her mouth was tender and very sweet.</p>
    <p>She stepped back and said quietly, "I think the Guardian has gone. The Lahal is under way again."</p>
    <p>Heath followed her without a word to the sweep. Her kiss burned in him like sweet fire. He was shaken and utterly confused.</p>
    <p>They toiled together while Broca slept. They dared not pause. Heath could distinguish the men now aboard the Lahal, little bent figures sculling, sculling, and there were always fresh ones. He could see the black tunics of the Children of the Moon who stood upon the foredeck and waited.</p>
    <p>The Ethne moved more and more slowly as the hours passed and the gap between the two ships grew steadily smaller. Night came and through the darkness they could hear the voice of Vakor howling after them.</p>
    <p>Toward midnight Broca roused. The fever had left him but he was morose and silent. He thrust Alor roughly aside and took the sweep and the Ethne gathered speed.</p>
    <p>"How much farther?" he asked. And Heath panted, "Not far now."</p>
    <p>Dawn came and still they were not clear of the weed. The Lahal was so near them now that Heath could see the jeweled fillet on Vakor's brow. He stood alone, high on the upper brace of the weed-knife, and he watched them, laughing.</p>
    <p>"Work!" he shouted at them. "Toil and sweat! You, Alor—woman of the gardens! This is better than the Temple. Broca—thief and breaker of the Law—strain your muscles there! And you, Earthman. For the second time you defy the gods!" He leaned out over the weed as though he would reach ahead and grasp the Ethne in his bare hands and drag her back.</p>
    <p>"Sweat and strain, you dogs! You can't escape!"</p>
    <p>And they did sweat and strain and fresh relays of men worked at the sweep of the Lahal, breaking their hearts to go faster and ever faster. Vakor laughed from his high perch and it seemed futile for the Ethne to go on any longer with this lost race.</p>
    <p>But Heath looked ahead with burning sunken eyes. He saw how the mists rose and gathered to the north, how the color of the weed changed, and he urged the others on. There was a fury in him now. It blazed brighter and harder than Broca's, this iron fury that would not, by the gods themselves, be balked of the Moonfire.</p>
    <p>They kept ahead—so little ahead that the Lahal was almost within arrow-shot of them. Then the weed thinned and the Ethne began to gain a little and suddenly, before they realized it, they were in open water.</p>
    <p>Like mad creatures they worked the scull and Heath steered the Ethne where he remembered the northern current ran, drawn by the Ocean-That-Is-Not-Water. After the terrible labor of the weed it seemed that they were flying. But as the mists began to wreathe about them the Lahal too had freed herself and was racing toward them with every man on the rowing benches.</p>
    <p>The mists thickened around them. The black water began to have a rare occasional hint of gold, like shooting sparks beneath the surface. There began to be islands, low and small, rank with queer vegetation. The flying dragons did not come here nor the Guardians nor the little reptiles. It was very hot and very still.</p>
    <p>Through the stillness the voice of Vakor rose in a harsh wild screaming as he cursed the rowers on.</p>
    <p>The current grew more swift and the dancing flecks of gold brightened in the water. Heath's face bore a strange unhuman look. The oars of the Lahal beat and churned and bowmen stood now on the foredeck, ready to shoot when they came within range.</p>
    <p>Then, incredibly, Vakor gave one long high scream and flung up his hand and the oars stopped. Vakor stretched both arms above his head, his fists clenched, and he hurled after them one terrible word of malediction.</p>
    <p>"I will wait, blasphemers! If so be you live I will be here—waiting!"</p>
    <p>The emerald sail dwindled in the Ethne's wake, faded and was lost in the mist.</p>
    <p>Broca said, "They had us. Why did they stop?"</p>
    <p>Heath pointed. Up ahead the whole misty north was touched with a breath of burning gold.</p>
    <p>"The Moonfire!"</p>

     <p>5: Into the Moonfire</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>This was the dream that had driven Heath to madness, the nightmare that had haunted him, the memory that had drawn him back in spite of terror and the certainty of destruction. Now it was reality and he could not separate it from the dream.</p>
    <p>Once again he watched the sea change until the Ethne drifted not on water but on a golden liquid that lapped her hull with soft rippling fire. Once again the mist enwrapped him, shining, glowing.</p>
    <p>The first faint tingling thrill moved in his blood and he knew how it would be—the lying pleasure that mounted through ecstasy to unendurable pain. He saw the dim islands, low and black, a maze through which a ship might wander forever without finding the source that poured out this wonder of living light.</p>
    <p>He saw the bones of ships that had died searching. They lay on the island beaches and the mist made them a bright shroud. There were not many of them. Some were so old that the race that built them had vanished out of the memory of Venus.</p>
    <p>The hushed unearthly beauty wrenched Heath's heart and he was afraid unto dying and yet filled with lust, with a terrible hunger.</p>
    <p>Broca drew the air deep into his lungs as though he would suck the power out of the Moonfire.</p>
    <p>"Can you find it again?" he asked. "The heart of it."</p>
    <p>"I can find it."</p>
    <p>Alor stood silent and unmoving. She was all silver in this light, dusted with golden motes.</p>
    <p>Heath said, "Are you afraid, breaking the taboo?"</p>
    <p>"Habit is hard to break." She turned to him and asked, "What is the Moonfire?"</p>
    <p>"Haven't the priests told you?"</p>
    <p>"They say that Venus once had a moon. It rode in the clouds like a disc of fire and the god who dwelt within it was supreme over all the other gods. He watched the surface of the planet and all that was done upon it. But the lesser gods were jealous, and one day they were able to destroy the palace of the Moon-god.</p>
    <p>"All the sky of Venus was lighted by that destruction. Mountains fell and seas poured out of their beds and whole nations died. The Moon-god was slain and his shining body fell like a meteor through the clouds.</p>
    <p>"But a god cannot really die. He only sleeps and waits. The golden mist is the cloud of his breathing, and the shining of his body is the Moonfire. A man may gain divinity from the heart of the sleeping god but all the gods of Venus will curse him if he tries because man has no right to steal their powers."</p>
    <p>"And you don't believe that story," said Heath.</p>
    <p>Alor shrugged. "You have seen the Moonfire. The priests have not."</p>
    <p>"I didn't get to the heart of it," Heath said. "I only saw the edge of the crater and the light that comes up out of it, the lovely hellish light."</p>
    <p>He stopped, shuddering, and brooded as he had so many times before on the truth behind the mystery of the Moonfire. Presently he said slowly, "There was a moon, of course, or there could be no conception of one in folklore. I believe it was radioactive, some element that hasn't been found yet or doesn't exist at all on Earth or Mars."</p>
    <p>"I don't understand," said Alor. "What is 'radioactive'?" She used the Terran word, as Heath had, because there was no term for it in Venusian.</p>
    <p>"It's a strange sort of fire that burns in certain elements. It eats them away, feeding on its own atoms, and the radiation from this fire is very powerful." He was silent for a moment, his eyes half closed. "Can't you feel it?" he asked. "The first little fire that burns in your own blood?"</p>
    <p>"Yes," Alor whispered. "I feel it."</p>
    <p>And Broca said, "It is like wine."</p>
    <p>Heath went on, putting the old, old thoughts into words. "The moon was destroyed. Not by jealous gods but by collision with another body, perhaps an asteroid. Or maybe it was burst apart by its own blazing energy. I think that a fragment of it survived and fell here and that its radiation permeated and changed the sea and the air around it.</p>
    <p>"It changes men in the same way. It seems to alter the whole electrical set-up of the brain, to amplify its power far beyond anything human. It gives the mind a force of will strong enough to control the free electrons in the air—to create . . ."</p>
    <p>He paused, then finished quietly, "In my case, only shadows. And when that mutation occurs a man doesn't need the gods of Venus to curse him. I got only a little of it but that was enough."</p>
    <p>Broca said, "It is worth bearing pain to become a god. You had no strength."</p>
    <p>Heath smiled crookedly. "How many gods have come out of the Moonfire?"</p>
    <p>Broca answered, "There will be one soon." Then he caught Alor by the shoulders and pulled her to him, looking down into her face. "No," he said. "Not one. Two."</p>
    <p>"Perhaps," said Heath, "there will be three."</p>
    <p>Broca turned and gave him a chill and level look. "I do not think," he said, "that your strength is any greater now."</p>
    <p>After that, for a long while, they did not speak. The Ethne drifted on, gliding on the slow currents that moved between the islands. Sometimes they sculled, the great blade of the sweep hidden in a froth of flame. The golden glow brightened and grew and with it grew the singing fire in their blood.</p>
    <p>Heath stood erect and strong at the helm, the old Heath who had sailed the Straits of Lhiva in the teeth of a summer gale and laughed about it. All weariness, all pain, all weakness, were swept away. It was the same with the others. Alor's head was high and Broca leaped up beside the figurehead and gave a great ringing shout, a challenge to all the gods there were to stop him.</p>
    <p>Heath found himself looking into Alor's eyes. She smiled, an aching thing of tears and tenderness and farewell.</p>
    <p>"I think none of us will live," she whispered. "May you find your shadow, David, before you die."</p>
    <p>Then Broca had turned toward them once more and the moment was gone.</p>
    <p>Within the veil of the Moonfire there was no day nor night nor time. Heath had no idea how long the Ethne's purple hull rode the golden current. The tingling force spread through his whole body and pulsed and strengthened until he was drunk with the pleasure of it and the islands slipped by, and there was no sound or movement but their own in all that solemn sea.</p>
    <p>And at last he saw ahead of him the supernal brightness that poured from the heart of the Moonfire, the living core of all the brightness of the mist. He saw the land, lifting dark and vague, drowned in the burning haze, and he steered toward it along the remembered way. There was no fear in him now. He was beyond fear.</p>
    <p>Broca cried out suddenly, "A ship!"</p>
    <p>Heath nodded. "It was there before. It will be there when the next man finds his way here."</p>
    <p>Two long arms of the island reached out to form a ragged bay. The Ethne entered it. They passed the derelict, floating patiently, untouched here by wind or tide or ocean rot. Her blue sail was furled, her rigging all neat and ready. She waited to begin the voyage home. She would wait a long, long time.</p>
    <p>As they neared the land they sighted other ships. They had not moved nor changed since Heath had seen them last, three years ago.</p>
    <p>A scant few they were, that had lived to find the Dragon's Throat and pass it, that had survived the Upper Seas and the island maze of the Moonfire and had found their goal at last. Some of them floated still where their crews had left them, their sad sails drooping from the yards.</p>
    <p>Others lay on their sides on the beach, as though in sleep. There were strange old keels that had not been seen on the seas of Venus for a thousand years. The golden mist preserved them and they waited like a pack of faithful dogs for their masters to return.</p>
    <p>Heath brought the Ethne in to shore at the same spot where he had beached her before. She grounded gently and he led the way over the side. He remembered the queer crumbling texture of the dark earth under his feet. He was shaken with the force that throbbed in his flesh. As before it hovered now on the edge of pain.</p>
    <p>He led the way inland and no one spoke.</p>
    <p>The mist thickened around them, filled with dancing sparks of light. The bay was lost behind its wreathing curtain. They walked forward and the ground began to rise under their feet slowly. They moved as in a dream and the light and the silence crushed them with a great awe.</p>
    <p>They came upon a dead man.</p>
    <p>He lay upon his face, his arms stretched out toward the mystery that lay beyond, his hands still yearning toward the glory he had never reached. They did not disturb him.</p>
    <p>Mist, heavier, the glow brightening, the golden motes whirling and flickering in a madder dance. Heath listened to the voice of pain that spoke within him, rising with every step he took toward a soundless scream.</p>
    <p>I remember, I remember! The bones, the flesh, the brain, each atom of them a separate flame, bursting, tearing to be free. I cannot go on, I cannot bear it! Soon I shall waken, safe in the mud behind Kalruna's.</p>
    <p>But he did not wake and the ground rose steadily under his feet and there was a madness on him, a passion and a suffering that were beyond man's strength to endure. Yet he endured.</p>
    <p>The swirling motes began to shape themselves into vague figures, formless giants that towered and strode around them. Heath heard Alor's moan of terror and forced himself to say, "They're nothing. Shadows out of our own minds. The beginning of the power."</p>
    <p>Farther they went and farther still, and then at last Heath stopped and flung up his arm to point, looking at Broca.</p>
    <p>"Your godhead lies there. Go and take it!"</p>
    <p>The eyes of the barbarian were dazed and wild, fixed on the dark dim line of the crater that showed in the distance, fixed on the incredible glory that shone there.</p>
    <p>"It beats," he whispered, "like the beating of a heart."</p>
    <p>Alor drew back, away from him, staring at the light. "I am afraid," she said. "I will not go." Heath saw that her face was agonized, her body shaken like his own. Her voice rose in a wail. "I can't go! I can't stand it. I'm dying!" Suddenly she caught Heath's hands. "David, take me back. Take me back!"</p>
    <p>Before he could think or speak Broca had torn Alor away from him and struck him a great swinging blow. Heath fell to the ground and the last thing he heard was Alor's voice crying his name.</p>

     <p>6: End of the Dream</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Heath was not unconscious long, for when he lifted his head again he could still see the others in the distance. Broca was running like a madman up the slope of the crater, carrying Alor in his arms. Ghostly and indistinct, he stood for an instant on the edge. Then he leaped over and was gone.</p>
    <p>Heath was alone.</p>
    <p>He lay still, fighting to keep his mind steady, struggling against the torture of his flesh.</p>
    <p>"Ethne, Ethne," he whispered. "This is the end of the dream."</p>
    <p>He began to crawl, inch by bitter inch, toward the heart of the Moonfire.</p>
    <p>He was closer to it now than he had been before. The strange rough earth cut his hands and his bare knees. The blood ran but the pain of it was less than a pinprick against the cosmic agony of the Moonfire. Broca must have suffered too, yet he had gone running to his fate. Perhaps his nervous system was duller, more resistant to shock. Or perhaps it was simply that his lust for power carried him on.</p>
    <p>Heath had no wish for power. He did not wish to be a god. He wished only to die and he knew that he was going to very soon. But before he died he would do what he had failed to do before. He would bring Ethne back. He would hear her voice again and look into her eyes and they would wait together for the final dark.</p>
    <p>Her image would vanish with his death, for then mind and memory would be gone. But he would not see the life go out of her as he had all those years ago by the Sea of Morning Opals. She would be with him until the end, sweet and loving and merry, as she had always been.</p>
    <p>He said her name over and over again as he crawled. He tried to think of nothing else, so that he might forget the terrible unhuman things that were happening within him.</p>
    <p>"Ethne, Ethne," he whispered. His hands clawed the earth and his knees scraped it and the brilliance of the Moonfire wrapped him in golden banners of mist. Yet he would not stop, though the soul was shaken out of him.</p>
    <p>He reached the edge of the crater and looked down upon the heart of the Moonfire.</p>
    <p>The whole vast crater was a sea of glowing vapor, so dense that it moved in little rippling waves, tipped with a sparkling froth. There was an island in that sea, a shape like a fallen mountain that burned with a blinding intensity, so great that only the eyes of a god could bear to look at it.</p>
    <p>It rode in the clouds like a disc of fire.</p>
    <p>Heath knew that his guess was right. It did not matter. Body of a sleeping god or scrap of a fallen moon—it would bring Ethne back to him and for that was all he cared.</p>
    <p>He dragged himself over the edge and let himself go, down the farther slope. He screamed once when the vapor closed over him.</p>
    <p>After that there was a period of utter strangeness.</p>
    <p>It seemed that some force separated the atoms that composed the organism called David Heath and reshuffled them into a different pattern. There was a wrench, an agony beyond anything he had known before and then, abruptly, the pain was gone. His body felt well and whole, his mind was awake, alert and clear with a dawning awareness of new power.</p>
    <p>He looked down at himself, ran his hands over his face. He had not changed. And yet he knew that he was different. He had taken the full force of the radiation this time and apparently it had completed the change begun three years ago. He was not the same David Heath, perhaps, but he was no longer trapped in the no-man's-land between the old and the new.</p>
    <p>He no longer felt that he was going to die and he no longer wished to. He was filled with a great strength and a great joy. He could bring his Ethne back now and they could live on together here in the golden garden of the Moonfire.</p>
    <p>It would have to be here. He was sure of that. He had only been into the fringe of the Moonfire before, but he did not believe that that was the whole reason why he could create nothing but shadows. There was not a sufficient concentration of the raw energy upon which the mind's telekinetic power worked.</p>
    <p>Probably, even in the outer mists of the Moonfire, there were not enough free electrons. But here, close to the source, the air was raging with them. Raw stuff of matter, to be shaped and formed.</p>
    <p>David Heath rose to his feet. He lifted his head and his arms reached out longingly. Straight and shining and strong he stood in the living light and his dark face was the face of a happy god.</p>
    <p>"Ethne," he whispered. "Ethne. This is not the end of the dream, but the beginning!"</p>
    <p>And she came.</p>
    <p>By the power, the exultant strength that was in him, Heath brought her out of the Moonfire. Ethne, slim and smiling, indistinct at first, a shadow in the mist, but growing clearer, coming toward him. He could see her white limbs, the pale flame of her hair, her red mouth bold and sweet, her wistful eyes.</p>
    <p>Heath recoiled with a cry. It was not Ethne who stood before him. It was Alor.</p>
    <p>For a time he could not move but stared at what he had created. The apparition smiled at him and her face was the face of a woman who has found love and with it the whole world.</p>
    <p>"No," he said. "It isn't you I want. It's Ethne!" He struck the thought of Alor from his mind and the image faded and once again he called Ethne to him.</p>
    <p>And when she came it was not Ethne but Alor.</p>
    <p>He destroyed the vision. Rage and disappointment almost too great to bear drove him to wander in the fog. Alor, Alor! Why did that wench of the temple gardens haunt him now?</p>
    <p>He hated her, yet her name sang in his heart and would not be silenced. He could not forget how she had kissed him and how her eyes had looked then and how her last desperate cry had been for him.</p>
    <p>He could not forget that his own heart had shaped her image while only his mind, his conscious mind, had said the name of Ethne.</p>
    <p>He sat down and bent his head over his knees and wept, because he knew now that this was the end of the dream. He had lost the old love forever without knowing it. It was a cruel thing, but it was true. He had to make his peace with it.</p>
    <p>And already Alor might be dead.</p>
    <p>That thought cut short his grieving for what was gone. He leaped up, filled with dread. He stood for a moment, looking wildly about, and the vapor was like golden water so that he could see only a few feet away. Then he began to run, shouting her name.</p>
    <p>For what might have been centuries in that timeless place he ran, searching for her. There was no answer to his cries. Sometimes he would see a dim figure crouching in the mist, and he would think that he had found her but each time it was the body of a man, dead for God knew how long. They were all alike. They were emaciated, as though they had died of starvation and they were all smiling. There seemed to be lost visions still in their open eyes.</p>
    <p>These were the gods of the Moonfire—the handful of men through all the ages who had fought their way through to the ultimate goal.</p>
    <p>Heath saw the cruelty of the jest. A man could find godhead in the golden lake. He could create his own world within it. But he could never leave it unless he was willing to leave also the world in which he was king. They would have learned that, these men, as they started back toward the harbor, away from the source.</p>
    <p>Or perhaps there was more to it. Perhaps they never tried to leave.</p>
    <p>Heath went on through the beautiful unchanging mist, calling Alor's name, and there was no answer. He realized that it was becoming more difficult for him to keep his mind on his quest. Half-formed images flickered vaguely around him. He grew excited and there was an urgency in him to stop and bring the visions clear, to build and create.</p>
    <p>He fought off the temptation but there came a time when he had to stop because he was too tired to go on. He sank down and the hopelessness of his search came over him. Alor was gone and he could never find her. In utter dejection he crouched there, his face buried in his hands, thinking of her, and all at once he heard her voice speaking his name. He started up and she was there, holding out her hands to him.</p>
    <p>He caught her to him and stroked her hair and kissed her, half sobbing with joy at having found her. Then a sudden thought came to him. He drew back and said, "Are you really Alor or only the shadow of my mind?"</p>
    <p>She did not answer but only held up her mouth to be kissed again.</p>
    <p>Heath turned away, too weary and hopeless even to destroy the vision. And then he thought, "Why should I destroy it? If the woman is lost to me why shouldn't I keep the dream?"</p>
    <p>He looked at her again and she was Alor, clothed in warm flesh, eager-eyed.</p>
    <p>The temptation swept over him again and this time he did not fight it. He was a god, whether he wished it or not. He would create.</p>
    <p>He threw the whole force of his mind against the golden mist, and the intoxication of sheer power made him drunk and mad with joy.</p>
    <p>The glowing cloud drew back to become a horizon and a sky. Under Heath's feet an island grew, warm sweet earth, rich with grass and rioting with flowers, a paradise lost in a dreaming sea. Wavelets whispered on the wide beaches, the drooping fronds of the liha-trees stirred lazily in the wind and bright birds darted, singing. Snug in the little cove a ship floated, a lovely thing that angels might have built.</p>
    <p>Perfection, the unattainable wish of the soul. And Alor was with him to share it.</p>
    <p>He knew now why no one had ever come out of the Moonfire.</p>
    <p>He took the vision of Alor by the hand. He wandered with it along the beaches and presently he was aware of something missing. He smiled, and once again the little dragon rode his shoulder and he stroked it and there was no least flaw in this Elysium. David Heath had found his godhead.</p>
    <p>But some stubborn corner of his heart betrayed him. It said, This is all a lie and Alor waits for you. If you tarry you and she will be as those others, who are dead and smiling in the Moonfire.</p>
    <p>He did not want to listen. He was happy. But something made him listen and he knew that as long as the real Alor lived he could not really be content with a dream. He knew that he must destroy this paradise before it destroyed him. He knew that the Moonfire was a deadly thing and that men could not be given the power of gods and continue sane.</p>
    <p>And yet he could not destroy the island. He could not!</p>
    <p>Horror overcame him that he had so far succumbed, that he could no longer control his own will. And he destroyed the island and the sea and the lovely ship and it was harder than if he had torn his own flesh from the bones.</p>
    <p>And he destroyed the vision of Alor.</p>
    <p>He knew that if he wished to escape the madness and the death of the Moonfire he must not again create so much as a blade of grass. Nothing. Because he would never again have the strength to resist the unholy joy of creation.</p>

     <p>7: To Walk Divine</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Once more he ran shouting through the golden fog. And it might have been a year or only a moment later that he heard Alor's voice very faintly in the distance, calling his name.</p>
    <p>He followed the sound, crying out more loudly, but he did not hear her again. Then, looming in shadowy grandeur through the mist, he saw a castle. It was a typical Upland stronghold but it was larger than the castle of any barbarian king and it was built out of one huge crimson jewel of the sort called Dragon's Blood.</p>
    <p>Heath knew that he was seeing part of Broca's dream.</p>
    <p>Steps of beaten gold led up to a greater door. Two tall warriors, harness blazing with gems, stood guard. Heath went between them and they caught and held him fast. Broca's hatred for the Earthman was implicit in the beings his mind created.</p>
    <p>Heath tried to tear himself free but their strength was more than human. They took him down fantastic corridors, over floors of pearl and crystal and precious metals. The walls were lined with open chests, full of every sort of treasure the barbarian mind could conceive. Slaves went silent footed on their errands and the air was heavy with perfume and spices. Heath thought how strange it was to walk through the halls of another man's dream.</p>
    <p>He was brought into a vast room where many people feasted. There were harpists and singers and dancing girls and throngs of slaves, men who wrestled and men who fought and danced with swords. The men and women at the long tables looked like chieftains and their wives but they wore plain leather and tunics without decoration, so that Broca's guardsmen and even his slaves were more resplendent than they.</p>
    <p>Above the shouting and the revelry Broca sat, high on a throne-chair that was made like a silver dragon with its jeweled wings spread wide. He wore magnificent harness and a carved diamond that only a high king may wear hung between his eyebrows. He drank wine out of a golden cup and watched the feasting with eyes that had in them no smallest flicker of humanity. God or demon, Broca was no longer a man.</p>
    <p>Alor sat beside him. She wore the robes of a queen but her face was hidden in her hands and her body was still as death.</p>
    <p>Heath's cry carried across all the noise of the feast. Broca leaped to his feet and an abrupt silence fell. Everyone, guards, chieftains and slaves, turned to watch as Heath was led toward the throne—and they all hated him as Broca hated.</p>
    <p>Alor raised her head and looked into his eyes. And she asked, in his own words, "Are you really David or only the shadow of my mind?"</p>
    <p>"I am David," he told her and was glad he had destroyed his paradise.</p>
    <p>Broca's mad gaze fixed on Heath. "I didn't think you had the strength," he said, and then he laughed. "But you're not a god! You stand there captive and you have no power."</p>
    <p>Heath knew that he could fight Broca on his own grounds but he did not dare. One taste of that ecstasy had almost destroyed him. If he tried it again he knew that he and the barbarian would hurl their shadow-armies against each other as long as they lived and he would be as mad as Broca.</p>
    <p>He looked about him at the hostile creatures who were solid and real enough to kill him at Broca's word. Then he said to Alor, "Do you wish to stay here now?"</p>
    <p>"I wish to go out of the Moonfire with you, David, if I can. If not I wish to die."</p>
    <p>The poison had not touched her yet. She had come without desire. Though she had bathed in the Moonfire she was still sane.</p>
    <p>Heath turned to Broca. "You see, she isn't worthy of you."</p>
    <p>Broca's face was dark with fury. He took Alor between his great hands and said, "You will stay with me. You're part of me. Listen, Alor. There's nothing I can't give you. I'll build other castles, other tribes, and I'll subdue them and put them in your lap. God and goddess together, Alor! We'll reign in glory."</p>
    <p>"I'm no goddess," Alor said. "Let me go."</p>
    <p>And Broca said, "I'll kill you, first." His gaze lowered on Heath. "I'll kill you both."</p>
    <p>Heath said, "Do the high gods stoop to tread on ants and worms? We don't deserve such honor, she and I. We're weak and even the Moonfire can't give us strength."</p>
    <p>He saw the flicker of thought in Broca's face and went on. "You're all-powerful, there's nothing you can't do. Why burden yourself with a mate too weak to worship you? Create another Alor, Broca! Create a goddess worthy of you!"</p>
    <p>After a moment Alor said, "Create a woman who can love you, Broca, and let us go."</p>
    <p>For a time there was silence in the place. The feasters and the dancers and the slaves stood without moving and their eyes glittered in the eerie light. And then Broca nodded.</p>
    <p>"It is well," he said. "Stand up, Alor."</p>
    <p>She stood. The look of power came into the face of the tall barbarian, the wild joy of molding heart's desire out of nothingness. Out of the golden air he shaped another Alor. She was not a woman but a thing of snow and flame and wonder, so that beside her the reality appeared drab and beautiless. She mounted the throne and sat beside her creator and put her hand in his and smiled.</p>
    <p>Broca willed the guardsmen to let Heath free. He went to Alor and Broca said contemptuously, "Get out of my sight."</p>
    <p>They went together across the crowded place, toward the archway through which Heath had entered. Still there was silence and no one moved.</p>
    <p>As they reached the archway it vanished, becoming solid wall. Behind them Broca laughed and suddenly the company burst also into wild jeering laughter.</p>
    <p>Heath caught Alor tighter by the hand and led her toward another door. It, too, disappeared and the mocking laughter screamed and echoed from the vault.</p>
    <p>Broca shouted, "Did you think that I would let you go—you two who betrayed me when I was a man? Even a god can remember!"</p>
    <p>Heath saw that the guardsmen and the others were closing in, and he saw how their eyes gleamed. He was filled with a black fear and he put Alor behind him.</p>
    <p>Broca cried, "Weakling! Even to save your life, you can't create!"</p>
    <p>It was true. He dared not. The shadow-people drew in upon him with their soulless eyes and their faces that were mirrors of the urge to kill.</p>
    <p>And then, suddenly, the answer came. Heath's answer rang back. "I will not create—but I will destroy!"</p>
    <p>Once again he threw the strength of his mind against the Moonfire but this time there was no unhealthy lure to what he did. There was no desire in him but his love for Alor and the need to keep her safe.</p>
    <p>The hands of the shadow-people reached out and dragged him away from Alor. He heard her scream and he knew that if he failed them would both be torn to pieces. He summoned all the force that was in him, all the love.</p>
    <p>He saw the faces of the shadow-people grow distorted and blurred. He felt their grip weaken and suddenly they were only shadows, a dim multitude in a crumbling castle of dreams.</p>
    <p>Broca's goddess faded with the dragon throne and Broca's kingly harness was only a web of memories half seen above the plain leather.</p>
    <p>Broca leaped to his feet with a wild, hoarse cry.</p>
    <p>Heath could feel how their two minds locked and swayed on that strange battleground. And as Broca fought to hold his vision, willing the particles of energy into the semblance of matter, so Heath fought to tear them down, to disperse them. For a time the shadows held in that half-world between existence and nothingness.</p>
    <p>Then the walls of the castle wavered and ran like red water and were gone. The goddess Alor, the dancers and the slaves and the chieftains, all were gone, and there were only the golden fog and a tall barbarian, stripped of his dreams, and the man Heath and the woman Alor.</p>
    <p>Heath looked at Broca and said, "I am stronger than you, because I threw away my godhead."</p>
    <p>Broca panted. "I will build again!"</p>
    <p>Heath said, "Build."</p>
    <p>And he did, his eyes blazing, his massive body shaken with the force of his will.</p>
    <p>It was all there again, the castle and the multitude of feasters and the jewels.</p>
    <p>Broca screamed to his shadow-people. "Kill!"</p>
    <p>But again, as their hands reached out to destroy, they began to weaken and fade.</p>
    <p>Heath cried, "If you want your kingdom, Broca, let us go!"</p>
    <p>The castle was now no more than a ghostly outline. Broca's face was beaded with sweat. His hands clawed the air. He swayed with his terrible effort but Heath's dark eyes were bleak and stern. If he had now the look of a god it was a god as ruthless and unshakeable as fate.</p>
    <p>The vision crumbled and vanished.</p>
    <p>Broca's head dropped. He would not look at them from the bitterness of his defeat. "Get out," he whispered. "Go and let Vakor greet you."</p>
    <p>Heath said, "It will be a cleaner death than this."</p>
    <p>Alor took his hand and they walked away together through the golden mist. They turned once to look back and already the castle walls were built again, towering magnificent.</p>
    <p>"He'll be happy," Heath said, "until he dies."</p>
    <p>Alor shuddered. "Let us go."</p>
    <p>They went together, away from the pulsing heart of the Moonfire, past the slopes of the crater and down the long way to the harbor. Finally they were aboard the Ethne once again.</p>
    <p>As they found their slow way out through the island maze Heath held Alor in his arms. They did not speak. Their lips met often with the poignancy of kisses that will not be for long. The golden mists thinned and the fire faded in their blood and the heady sense of power was gone but they did not know nor care.</p>
    <p>They came at last out of the veil of the Moonfire and saw ahead the green sail of the Lahal, where Vakor waited.</p>
    <p>Alor whispered, "Goodbye, my love, my David!" and left the bitterness of her tears upon his mouth.</p>
    <p>The two ships lay side by side in the still water. Vakor was waiting as Heath and Alor came aboard with the other Children of the Moon beside him. He motioned to the seamen who stood there also and said, "Seize them."</p>
    <p>But the men were afraid and would not touch them.</p>
    <p>Heath saw their faces and wondered. Then, as he looked at Alor, he realized that she was not as she had been before. There was something clean and shining about her now, a new depth and a new calm strength, and in her eyes a strange new beauty. He knew that he himself had changed. They were no longer gods, he and Alor, but they had bathed in the Moonfire and they would never again be quite the same.</p>
    <p>He met Vakor's gaze and was not afraid.</p>
    <p>The cruel, wolfish face of the priest lost some of its assurance. A queer look of doubt crossed over it.</p>
    <p>He said, "Where is Broca?"</p>
    <p>"We left him there, building empires in the mist."</p>
    <p>"At the heart of the Moonfire?"</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>"You lie!" cried Vakor. "You could not have come back yourselves, from the heart of the sleeping god. No one ever has." But still the doubt was there.</p>
    <p>Heath shrugged. "It doesn't really matter," he said, "whether you believe or not."</p>
    <p>There was a long, strange silence. Then the four tall priests in their black tunics said to Vakor, "We must believe. Look into their eyes."</p>
    <p>With a solemn ritual gesture they stepped back and left Vakor alone.</p>
    <p>Vakor whispered, "It can't be true. The law, the taboo is built on that rock. Men will come out of the fringe as you did, Heath, wrecked and cursed by their blasphemy. But not from the Moonfire itself. Never! That is why the law was made, lest all of Venus die in dreams."</p>
    <p>Alor said quietly, "All those others wanted power. We wanted only love. We needed nothing else."</p>
    <p>Again there was silence while Vakor stared at them and struggled with himself. Then, very slowly, he said, "You are beyond my power. The sleeping god received you and has chosen to let you go unscathed. I am only a Child of the Moon. I may not judge."</p>
    <p>He covered his face and turned away.</p>
    <p>One of the lesser priests spoke to Johor. "Let them be given men for their oars."</p>
    <p>And Heath and Alor understood that they were free.</p>
    <p>Weeks later, Heath and Alor stood at dawn on the shore of the Sea of Morning Opals. The breeze was strong off the land. It filled the golden sail of the Ethne, so that she strained at her mooring lines, eager to be free.</p>
    <p>Heath bent and cast them off.</p>
    <p>They stood together silently and watched as the little ship gathered speed, going lightly, sweetly and alone into the glory of the morning. The ivory image that was her figurehead lifted its arms to the dawn and smiled and Heath waited there until the last bright gleam of the sail was lost and with it the last of his old life, his memories and his dreams.</p>
    <p>Alor touched him gently. He turned and took her in his arms, and they walked away under the liha-trees, while the young day brightened in the sky. And they thought how the light of the sun they never saw was more beautiful and full of promise than all the naked wonder of the Moonfire that they had held within their hands.</p>

    <p>The ship moved slowly across the Red Sea, through the shrouding veils of mist, her sail barely filled by the languid thrust of the wind. Her hull, of a thin light metal, floated without sound, the surface of the strange ocean parting before her prow in silent rippling streamers of flame.</p>
    <p>Night deepened toward the ship, a river of indigo flowing out of the west. The man known as Stark stood alone by the after rail and watched its coming. He was full of impatience and a gathering sense of danger, so that it seemed to him that even the hot wind smelled of it.</p>
    <p>The steersman lay drowsily over his sweep. He was a big man, with skin and hair the color of milk. He did not speak, but Stark felt that now and again the man's eyes turned toward him, pale and calculating under half-closed lids, with a secret avarice.</p>
    <p>The captain and the two other members of the little coasting vessel's crew were forward, at their evening meal. Once or twice Stark heard a burst of laughter, half-whispered and furtive. It was as though all four shared in some private joke, from which he was rigidly excluded.</p>
    <p>The heat was oppressive. Sweat gathered on Stark's dark face. His shirt stuck to his back. The air was heavy with moisture, tainted with the muddy fecundity of the land that brooded westward behind the eternal fog.</p>
    <p>There was something ominous about the sea itself. Even on its own world, the Red Sea is hardly more than legend. It lies behind the Mountains of White Cloud, the great barrier wall that hides away half a planet. Few men have gone beyond that barrier, into the vast mystery of Inner Venus. Fewer still have come back.</p>
    <p>Stark was one of that handful. Three times before he had crossed the mountains, and once he had stayed for nearly a year. But he had never quite grown used to the Red Sea.</p>
    <p>It was not water. It was gaseous, dense enough to float the buoyant hulls of the metal ships, and it burned perpetually with its deep inner fires. The mists that clouded it were stained with the bloody glow. Beneath the surface Stark could see the drifts of flame where the lazy currents ran, and the little coiling bursts of sparks that came upward and spread and melted into other bursts, so that the face of the sea was like a cosmos of crimson stars.</p>
    <p>It was very beautiful, glowing against the blue, luminous darkness of the night. Beautiful, and strange.</p>
    <p>There was a padding of bare feet, and the captain, Malthor, came up to Stark, his outlines dim and ghostly in the gloom.</p>
    <p>"We will reach Shuruun," he said, "before the second glass is run."</p>
    <p>Stark nodded. "Good."</p>
    <p>The voyage had seemed endless, and the close confinement of the narrow deck had got badly on his nerves.</p>
    <p>"You will like Shuruun," said the captain jovially. "Our wine, our food, our women—all superb. We don't have many visitors. We keep to ourselves, as you will see. But those who do come…"</p>
    <p>He laughed, and clapped Stark on the shoulder. "Ah, yes. You will be happy in Shuruun!"</p>
    <p>It seemed to Stark that he caught an echo of laughter from the unseen crew, as though they listened and found a hidden jest in Malthor's words.</p>
    <p>Stark said, "That's fine."</p>
    <p>"Perhaps," said Malthor, "you would like to lodge with me. I could make you a good price."</p>
    <p>He had made a good price for Stark's passage from up the coast. An exorbitantly good one.</p>
    <p>Stark said, "No."</p>
    <p>"You don't have to be afraid," said the Venusian, in a confidential tone. "The strangers who come to Shuruun all have the same reason. It's a good place to hide. We're out of everybody's reach."</p>
    <p>He paused, but Stark did not rise to his bait. Presently he chuckled and went on, "In fact, it's such a safe place that most of the strangers decide to stay on. Now, at my house, I could give you…"</p>
    <p>Stark said again, flatly, "No."</p>
    <p>The captain shrugged. "Very well. Think it over, anyway." He peered ahead into the red, coiling mists. "Ah! See there?" He pointed, and Stark made out the shadowy loom of cliffs. "We are coming into the strait now."</p>
    <p>Malthor turned and took the steering sweep himself, the helmsman going forward to join the others. The ship began to pick up speed. Stark saw that she had come into the grip of a current that swept toward the cliffs, a river of fire racing ever more swiftly in the depths of the sea.</p>
    <p>The dark wall seemed to plunge toward them. At first Stark could see no passage. Then, suddenly, a narrow crimson streak appeared, widened, and became a gut of boiling flame, rushing silently around broken rocks. Red fog rose like smoke. The ship quivered, sprang ahead, and tore like a mad thing into the heart of the inferno.</p>
    <p>In spite of himself, Stark's hands tightened on the rail. Tattered veils of mist swirled past them. The sea, the air, the ship itself, seemed drenched in blood. There was no sound, in all that wild sweep of current through the strait Only the sullen fires burst and flowed.</p>
    <p>The reflected glare showed Stark that the Straits of Shuruun were defended. Squat fortresses brooded on the cliffs. There were ballistas, and great windlasses for the drawing of nets across the narrow throat. The men of Shuruun could enforce their law that barred all foreign shipping from their gulf.</p>
    <p>They had reason for such a law, and such a defense. The legitimate trade of Shuruun, such as it was, was in wine and the delicate laces woven from spider-silk. Actually, however, the city lived and throve on piracy, the arts of wrecking, and a contraband trade in the distilled juice of the vela poppy.</p>
    <p>Looking at the rocks and the fortresses, Stark could understand how it was that Shuruun had been able for more centuries than anyone could tell to victimize the shipping of the Red Sea, and offer a refuge to the outlaw, the wolf's-head, the breaker of taboo.</p>
    <p>With startling abruptness, they were through the gut and drifting on the still surface of this all but landlocked arm of the Red Sea.</p>
    <p>Because of the shrouding fog, Stark could see nothing of the land. But the smell of it was stronger, warm damp soil and the heavy, faintly rotten perfume of vegetation half jungle, half swamp. Once, through a rift in the wreathing vapor, he thought he glimpsed the shadowy bulk of an island, but it was gone at once.</p>
    <p>After the terrifying rush of the strait, it seemed to Stark that the ship barely moved. His impatience and the subtle sense of danger deepened. He began to pace the deck, with the nervous, velvet motion of a prowling cat. The moist, steamy air seemed all but unbreathable after the clean dryness of Mars, from whence he had come so recently. It was oppressively still.</p>
    <p>Suddenly he stopped, his head thrown back, listening.</p>
    <p>The sound was borne faintly on the slow wind. It came from everywhere and nowhere, a vague dim thing without source or direction. It almost seemed that the night itself had spoken—the hot blue night of Venus, crying out of the mists with a tongue of infinite woe.</p>
    <p>It faded and died away, only half heard, leaving behind it a sense of aching sadness, as though all the misery and longing of a world had found voice in that desolate wail.</p>
    <p>Stark shivered. For a time there was silence, and then he heard the sound again, now on a deeper note. Still faint and far away, it was sustained longer by the vagaries of the heavy air, and it became a chant, rising and falling. There were no words. It was not the sort of thing that would have need of words. Then it was gone again.</p>
    <p>Stark turned to Malthor. "What was that?"</p>
    <p>The man looked at him curiously. He seemed not to have heard.</p>
    <p>"That wailing sound," said Stark impatiently.</p>
    <p>"Oh, that." The Venusian shrugged. "A trick of the wind. It sighs in the hollow rocks around the strait."</p>
    <p>He yawned, giving place again to the steersman, and came to stand beside Stark. The Earthman ignored him. For some reason, that sound half heard through the mists had brought his uneasiness to a sharp pitch.</p>
    <p>Civilization had brushed over Stark with a light hand. Raised from infancy by half-human aboriginals, his perceptions were still those of a savage. His ear was good.</p>
    <p>Malthor lied. That cry of pain was not made by any wind.</p>
    <p>"I have known several Earthmen," said Malthor, changing the subject, but not too swiftly. "None of them were like you."</p>
    <p>Intuition warned Stark to play along. "I don't come from Earth," he said. "I come from Mercury."</p>
    <p>Malthor puzzled over that. Venus is a cloudy world, where no man has ever seen the Sun, let alone a star. The captain had heard vaguely of these things. Earth and Mars he knew of. But Mercury was an unknown word.</p>
    <p>Stark explained. "The planet nearest the Sun. It's very hot there. The Sun blazes like a huge fire, and there are no clouds to shield it."</p>
    <p>"Ah. That is why your skin is so dark." He held his own pale forearm close to Stark's and shook his head. "I have never seen such skin," he said admiringly. "Nor such great muscles."</p>
    <p>Looking up, he went on in a tone of complete friendliness, "I wish you would stay with me. You'll find no better lodgings in Shuruun. And I warn you, there are people in the town who will take advantage of strangers—rob them, even slay them. Now, I am known by all as a man of honor. You could sleep soundly under my roof."</p>
    <p>He paused, then added with a smile, "Also, I have a daughter. An excellent cook—and very beautiful."</p>
    <p>The woeful chanting came again, dim and distant on the wind, an echo of warning against some unimagined fate.</p>
    <p>Stark said for the third time, "No."</p>
    <p>He needed no intuition to tell him to walk wide of the captain. The man was a rogue, and not a very subtle one.</p>
    <p>A flint-hard, angry look came briefly into Malthor's eyes. "You're a stubborn man. You'll find that Shuruun is no place for stubbornness."</p>
    <p>He turned and went away. Stark remained where he was. The ship drifted on through a slow eternity of time. And all down that long still gulf of the Red Sea, through the heat and the wreathing fog, the ghostly chanting haunted him, like the keening of lost souls in some forgotten hell.</p>
    <p>Presently the course of the ship was altered. Malthor came again to the afterdeck, giving a few quiet commands. Stark saw land ahead, a darker blur on the night, and then the shrouded outlines of a city.</p>
    <p>Torches blazed on the quays and in the streets, and the low buildings caught a ruddy glow from the burning sea itself. A squat and ugly town, Shuruun, crouching witch-like on the rocky shore, her ragged skirts dipped in blood.</p>
    <p>The ship drifted in toward the quays.</p>
    <p>Stark heard a whisper of movement behind him, the hushed and purposeful padding of naked feet. He turned, with the astonishing swiftness of an animal that feels itself threatened, his hand dropping to his gun.</p>
    <p>A belaying pin, thrown by the steersman, struck the side of his head with stunning force. Reeling, half blinded, he saw the distorted shapes of men closing in upon him. Malthor's voice sounded, low and hard. A second belaying pin whizzed through the air and cracked against Stark's shoulder.</p>
    <p>Hands were laid upon him. Bodies, heavy and strong, bore his down. Malthor laughed.</p>
    <p>Stark's teeth glinted bare and white. Someone's cheek brushed past, and he sank them into the flesh. He began to growl, a sound that should never have come from a human throat. It seemed to the startled Venusians that the man they had attacked had by some wizardry become a beast, at the first touch of violence.</p>
    <p>The man with the torn cheek screamed. There was a voiceless scuffling on the deck, a terrible intensity of motion, and then the great dark body rose and shook itself free of the tangle, and was gone, over the rail, leaving Malthor with nothing but the silken rags of a shirt in his hands.</p>
    <p>The surface of the Red Sea closed without a ripple over Stark. There was a burst of crimson sparks, a momentary trail of flame going down like a drowned comet, and then—nothing.</p>

     <p>II</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Stark dropped slowly downward through a strange world. There was no difficulty about breathing, as in a sea of water. The gases of the Red Sea support life quite well, and the creatures that dwell in it have almost normal lungs.</p>
    <p>Stark did not pay much attention at first, except to keep his balance automatically. He was still dazed from the blow, and he was raging with anger and pain.</p>
    <p>The primitive in him, whose name was not Stark but N'Chaka, and who had fought and starved and hunted in the blazing valleys of Mercury's Twilight Belt, learning lessons he never forgot, wished to return and slay Malthor and his men. He regretted that he had not torn out their throats, for now his trail would never be safe from them.</p>
    <p>But the man Stark, who had learned some more bitter lessons in the name of civilization, knew the unwisdom of that. He snarled over his aching head, and cursed the Venusians in the harsh, crude dialect that was his mother tongue, but he did not turn back. There would be time enough for Malthor.</p>
    <p>It struck him that the gulf was very deep.</p>
    <p>Fighting down his rage, he began to swim in the direction of the shore. There was no sign of pursuit, and he judged that Malthor had decided to let him go. He puzzled over the reason for the attack. It could hardly be robbery, since he carried nothing but the clothes he stood in, and very little money.</p>
    <p>No. There was some deeper reason. A reason connected with Malthor's insistence that he lodge with him. Stark smiled. It was not a pleasant smile. He was thinking of Shuruun, and the things men said about it, around the shores of the Red Sea.</p>
    <p>Then his face hardened. The dim coiling fires through which he swam brought him memories of other times he had gone adventuring in the depths of the Red Sea.</p>
    <p>He had not been alone then. Helvi had gone with him—the tall son of a barbarian kinglet up-coast by Yarell. They had hunted strange beasts through the crystal forests of the sea-bottom and bathed in the welling flames that pulse from the very heart of Venus to feed the ocean. They had been brothers.</p>
    <p>Now Helvi was gone, into Shuruun. He had never returned.</p>
    <p>Stark swam on. And presently he saw below him in the red gloom something that made him drop lower, frowning with surprise.</p>
    <p>There were trees beneath him. Great forest giants towering up into an eerie sky, their branches swaying gently to the slow wash of the currents.</p>
    <p>Stark was puzzled. The forests where he and Helvi had hunted were truly crystalline, without even the memory of life. The "trees" were no more trees in actuality than the branching corals of Terra's southern oceans.</p>
    <p>But these were real, or had been. He thought at first that they still lived, for their leaves were green, and here and there creepers had starred them with great nodding blossoms of gold and purple and waxy white. But when he floated down close enough to touch them, he realized that they were dead—trees, creepers, blossoms, all.</p>
    <p>They had not mummified, nor turned to stone. They were pliable, and their colors were very bright. Simply, they had ceased to live, and the gases of the sea had preserved them by some chemical magic, so perfectly that barely a leaf had fallen.</p>
    <p>Stark did not venture into the shadowy denseness below the topmost branches. A strange fear came over him, at the sight of that vast forest dreaming in the depths of the gulf, drowned and forgotten, as though wondering why the birds had gone, taking with them the warm rains and the light of day.</p>
    <p>He thrust his way upward, himself like a huge dark bird above the branches. An overwhelming impulse to get away from that unearthly place drove him on, his half-wild sense shuddering with an impression of evil so great that it took all his acquired common-sense to assure him that he was not pursued by demons.</p>
    <p>He broke the surface at last, to find that he had lost his direction in the red deep and made a long circle around, so that he was far below Shuruun. He made his way back, not hurrying now, and presently clambered out over the black rocks.</p>
    <p>He stood at the end of a muddy lane that wandered in toward the town. He followed it, moving neither fast nor slow, but with a wary alertness.</p>
    <p>Huts of wattle-and-daub took shape out of the fog, increased in numbers, became a street of dwellings. Here and there rush-lights glimmered through the slitted windows. A man and a woman clung together in a low doorway. They saw him and sprang apart, and the woman gave a little cry. Stark went on. He did not look back, but he knew that they were following him quietly, at a little distance.</p>
    <p>The lane twisted snakelike upon itself, crawling now through a crowded jumble of houses. There were more lights, and more people, tall white-skinned folk of the swamp-edges, with pale eyes and long hair the color of new flax, and the faces of wolves.</p>
    <p>Stark passed among them, alien and strange with his black hair and sun-darkened skin. They did not speak, nor try to stop him. Only they looked at him out of the red fog, with a curious blend of amusement and fear, and some of them followed him, keeping well behind. A gang of small naked children came from somewhere among the houses and ran shouting beside him, out of reach, until one boy threw a stone and screamed something unintelligible except for one word—Lhari. Then they all stopped, horrified, and fled.</p>
    <p>Stark went on, through the quarter of the lacemakers, heading by instinct toward the wharves. The glow of the Red Sea pervaded all the air, so that it seemed as though the mist was full of tiny drops of blood. There was a smell about the place he did not like, a damp miasma of mud and crowding bodies and wine, and the breath of the vela poppy. Shuruun was an unclean town, and it stank of evil.</p>
    <p>There was something else about it, a subtle thing that touched Stark's nerves with a chill finger. Fear. He could see the shadow of it in the eyes of the people, hear its undertone in their voices. The wolves of Shuruun did not feel safe in their own kennel. Unconsciously, as this feeling grew upon him, Stark's step grew more and more wary, his eyes more cold and hard.</p>
    <p>He came out into a broad square by the harbor front. He could see the ghostly ships moored along the quays, the piled casks of wine, the tangle of masts and cordage dim against the background of the burning gulf. There were many torches here. Large low buildings stood around the square. There was laughter and the sound of voices from the dark verandas, and somewhere a woman sang to the melancholy lilting of a reed pipe.</p>
    <p>A suffused glow of light in the distance ahead caught Stark's eye. That way the streets sloped to a higher ground, and straining his vision against the fog, he made out very dimly the tall bulk of a castle crouched on the low cliffs, looking with bright eyes upon the night, and the streets of Shuruun.</p>
    <p>Stark hesitated briefly. Then he started across the square toward the largest of the taverns.</p>
    <p>There were a number of people in the open space, mostly sailors and their women. They were loose and foolish with wine, but even so they stopped where they were and stared at the dark stranger, and then drew back from him, still staring.</p>
    <p>Those who had followed Stark came into the square after him and then paused, spreading out in an aimless sort of way to join with other groups, whispering among themselves.</p>
    <p>The woman stopped singing in the middle of a phrase.</p>
    <p>A curious silence fell on the square. A nervous sibilance ran round and round under the silence, and men came slowly out from the verandas and the doors of the wine shops. Suddenly a woman with disheveled hair pointed her arm at Stark and laughed, the shrieking laugh of a harpy.</p>
    <p>Stark found his way barred by three tall young men with hard mouths and crafty eyes, who smiled at him as hounds smile before the kill.</p>
    <p>"Stranger," they said. "Earthman."</p>
    <p>"Outlaw," answered Stark, and it was only half a lie.</p>
    <p>One of the young men took a step forward. "Did you fly like a dragon over the Mountains of White Cloud? Did you drop from the sky?"</p>
    <p>"I came on Malthor's ship."</p>
    <p>A kind of sigh went round the square, and with it the name of Malthor. The eager faces of the young men grew heavy with disappointment. But the leader said sharply, "I was on the quay when Malthor docked. You were not on board."</p>
    <p>It was Stark's turn to smile. In the light of the torches, his eyes blazed cold and bright as ice against the sun.</p>
    <p>"Ask Malthor the reason for that," he said. "Ask the man with the torn cheek. Or perhaps," he added softly, "you would like to learn for yourselves."</p>
    <p>The young men looked at him, scowling, in an odd mood of indecision. Stark settled himself, every muscle loose and ready. And the woman who had laughed crept closer and peered at Stark through her tangled hair, breathing heavily of the poppy wine.</p>
    <p>All at once she said loudly, "He came out of the sea. That's where he came from. He's…"</p>
    <p>One of the young men struck her across the mouth and she fell down in the mud. A burly seaman ran out and caught her by the hair, dragging her to her feet again. His face was frightened and very angry. He hauled the woman away, cursing her for a fool and beating her as he went. She spat out blood, and said no more.</p>
    <p>"Well," said Stark to the young men. "Have you made up your minds?"</p>
    <p>"Minds!" said a voice behind them—a harsh-timbered, rasping voice that handled the liquid vocables of the Venusian speech very clumsily indeed. "They have no minds, these whelps! If they had, they'd be off about their business, instead of standing here badgering a stranger."</p>
    <p>The young men turned, and now between them Stark could see the man who had spoken. He stood on the steps of the tavern. He was an Earthman, and at first Stark thought he was old, because his hair was white and his face deeply lined. His body was wasted with fever, the muscles all gone to knotty strings twisted over bone. He leaned heavily on a stick, and one leg was crooked and terribly scarred.</p>
    <p>He grinned at Stark and said, in colloquial English, "Watch me get rid of 'em!"</p>
    <p>He began to tongue-lash the young men, telling them that they were idiots, the misbegotten offspring of swamp-toads, utterly without manners, and that if they did not believe the stranger's story they should go and ask Malthor, as he suggested. Finally he shook his stick at them, fairly screeching.</p>
    <p>"Go on, now. Go away! Leave us alone—my brother of Earth and I!"</p>
    <p>The young men gave one hesitant glance at Stark's feral eyes. Then they looked at each other and shrugged, and went away across the square half sheepishly, like great loutish boys caught in some misdemeanor.</p>
    <p>The white-haired Earthman beckoned to Stark. And, as Stark came up to him on the steps he said under his breath, almost angrily, "You're in a trap."</p>
    <p>Stark glanced back over his shoulder. At the edge of the square the three young men had met a fourth, who had his face bound up in a rag. They vanished almost at once into a side street, but not before Stark had recognized the fourth man as Malthor.</p>
    <p>It was the captain he had branded.</p>
    <p>With loud cheerfulness, the lame man said in Venusian, "Come in and drink with me, brother, and we will talk of Earth."</p>

     <p>III</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>The tavern was of the standard low-class Venusian pattern—a single huge room under bare thatch, the wall half open with the reed shutters rolled up, the floor of split logs propped up on piling out of the mud. A long low bar, little tables, mangy skins and heaps of dubious cushions on the floor around them, and at one end the entertainers—two old men with a drum and a reed pipe, and a couple of sulky, tired-looking girls.</p>
    <p>The lame man led Stark to a table in the corner and sank down, calling for wine. His eyes, which were dark and haunted by long pain, burned with excitement. His hands shook. Before Stark had sat down he had begun to talk, his words stumbling over themselves as though he could not get them out fast enough.</p>
    <p>"How is it there now? Has it changed any? Tell me how it is—the cities, the lights, the paved streets, the women, the Sun. Oh Lord, what I wouldn't give to see the Sun again, and women with dark hair and their clothes on!" He leaned forward, staring hungrily into Stark's face, as though he could see those things mirrored there. "For God's sake, talk to me—talk to me in English, and tell me about Earth!"</p>
    <p>"How long have you been here?" asked Stark.</p>
    <p>"I don't know. How do you reckon time on a world without a Sun, without one damned little star to look at? Ten years, a hundred years, how should I know? Forever. Tell me about Earth."</p>
    <p>Stark smiled wryly. "I haven't been there for a long time. The police were too ready with a welcoming committee. But the last time I saw it, it was just the same."</p>
    <p>The lame man shivered. He was not looking at Stark now, but at some place far beyond him.</p>
    <p>"Autumn woods," he said. "Red and gold on the brown hills. Snow. I can remember how it felt to be cold. The air bit you when you breathed it. And the women wore high-heeled slippers. No big bare feet tromping in the mud, but little sharp heels tapping on clean pavement."</p>
    <p>Suddenly he glared at Stark, his eyes furious and bright with tears.</p>
    <p>"Why the hell did you have to come here and start me remembering? I'm Larrabee. I live in Shuruun. I've been here forever, and I'll be here till I die. There isn't any Earth. It's gone. Just look up into the sky, and you'll know it's gone. There's nothing anywhere but clouds, and Venus, and mud."</p>
    <p>He sat still, shaking, turning his head from side to side. A man came with wine, put it down, and went away again. The tavern was very quiet. There was a wide space empty around the two Earthmen. Beyond that people lay on the cushions, sipping the poppy wine and watching with a sort of furtive expectancy.</p>
    <p>Abruptly, Larrabee laughed, a harsh sound that held a certain honest mirth.</p>
    <p>"I don't know why I should get sentimental about Earth at this late date. Never thought much about it when I was there."</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, he kept his gaze averted, and when he picked up his cup his hand trembled so that he spilled some of the wine.</p>
    <p>Stark was staring at him in unbelief. "Larrabee," he said. "You're Mike Larrabee. You're the man who got half a million credits out of the strong room of the Royal Venus."</p>
    <p>Larrabee nodded. "And got away with it, right over the Mountains of White Cloud, that they said couldn't be flown. And do you know where that half a million is now? At the bottom of the Red Sea, along with my ship and my crew, out there in the gulf. Lord knows why I lived." He shrugged. "Well, anyway, I was heading for Shuruun when I crashed, and I got here. So why complain?"</p>
    <p>He drank again, deeply, and Stark shook his head.</p>
    <p>"You've been here nine years, then, by Earth time," he said. He had never met Larrabee, but he remembered the pictures of him that had flashed across space on police bands. Larrabee had been a young man then, dark and proud and handsome.</p>
    <p>Larrabee guessed his thought. "I've changed, haven't I?"</p>
    <p>Stark said lamely, "Everybody thought you were dead.''</p>
    <p>Larrabee laughed. After that, for a moment, there was silence. Stark's ears were straining for any sound outside. There was none.</p>
    <p>He said abruptly, "What about this trap I'm in?"</p>
    <p>"I'll tell you one thing about it," said Larrabee. "There's no way out. I can't help you. I wouldn't if I could, get that straight. But I can't, anyway."</p>
    <p>"Thanks," Stark said sourly. "You can at least tell me what goes on."</p>
    <p>"Listen," said Larrabee. "I'm a cripple, and an old man, and Shuruun isn't the sweetest place in the solar system to live. But I do live. I have a wife, a slatternly wench I'll admit, but good enough in her way. You'll notice some little dark-haired brats rolling in the mud. They're mine, too. I have some skill at setting bones and such, and so I can get drunk for nothing as often as I will—which is often. Also, because of this bum leg, I'm perfectly safe. So don't ask me what goes on. I take great pains not to know."</p>
    <p>Stark said, "Who are the Lhari?"</p>
    <p>"Would you like to meet them?" Larrabee seemed to find something very amusing in that thought. "Just go on up to the castle. They live there. They're the Lords of Shuruun, and they're always glad to meet strangers."</p>
    <p>He leaned forward suddenly. "Who are you anyway? What's your name, and why the devil did you come here?"</p>
    <p>"My name is Stark. And I came here for the same reason you did."</p>
    <p>"Stark," repeated Larrabee slowly, his eyes intent. "That rings a faint bell. Seems to me I saw a Wanted flash once, some idiot that had led a native revolt somewhere in the Jovian Colonies—a big cold-eyed brute they referred to colorfully as the wild man from Mercury."</p>
    <p>He nodded, pleased with himself. "Wild man, eh? Well, Shuruun will tame you down!"</p>
    <p>"Perhaps," said Stark. His eyes shifted constantly, watching Larrabee, watching the doorway and the dark veranda and the people who drank but did not talk among themselves. "Speaking of strangers, one came here at the time of the last rains. He was Venusian, from up coast. A big young man. I used to know him. Perhaps he could help me."</p>
    <p>Larrabee snorted. By now, he had drunk his own wine and Stark's too. "Nobody can help you. As for your friend, I never saw him. I'm beginning to think I should never have seen you." Quite suddenly he caught up his stick and got with some difficulty to his feet. He did not look at Stark, but said harshly, "You better get out of here." Then he turned and limped unsteadily to the bar.</p>
    <p>Stark rose. He glanced after Larrabee, and again his nostrils twitched to the smell of fear. Then he went out of the tavern the way he had come in, through the front door. No one moved to stop him. Outside, the square was empty. It had begun to rain.</p>
    <p>Stark stood for a moment on the steps. He was angry, and filled with a dangerous unease, the hair-trigger nervousness of a tiger that senses the beaters creeping toward him up the wind. He would almost have welcomed the sight of Malthor and the three young men. But there was nothing to fight but the silence and the rain.</p>
    <p>He stepped out into the mud, wet and warm around his ankles. An idea came to him, and he smiled, beginning now to move with a definite purpose, along the side of the square.</p>
    <p>The sharp downpour strengthened. Rain smoked from Stark's naked shoulders, beat against thatch and mud with a hissing rattle. The harbor had disappeared behind boiling clouds of fog, where water struck the surface of the Red Sea and was turned again instantly by chemical action into vapor. The quays and the neighboring streets were being swallowed up in the impenetrable mist. Lightning came with an eerie bluish flare, and thunder came rolling after it.</p>
    <p>Stark turned up the narrow way that led toward the castle.</p>
    <p>Its lights were winking out now, one by one, blotted by the creeping fog. Lightning etched its shadowy bulk against the night, and then was gone. And through the noise of the thunder that followed, Stark thought he heard a voice calling.</p>
    <p>He stopped, half crouching, his hand on his gun. The cry came again, a girl's voice, thin as the wail of a sea-bird through the driving rain. Then he saw her, a small white blur in the street behind him, running, and even in that dim glimpse of her every line of her body was instinct with fright.</p>
    <p>Stark set his back against a wall and waited. There did not seem to be anyone with her, though it was hard to tell in the darkness and the storm.</p>
    <p>She came up to him, and stopped, just out of his reach, looking at him and away again with a painful irresoluteness. A bright flash showed her to him clearly. She was young, not long out of her childhood, and pretty in a stupid sort of way. Just now her mouth trembled on the edge of weeping, and her eyes were very large and scared. Her skirt clung to her long thighs, and above it her naked body, hardly fleshed into womanhood, glistened like snow in the wet. Her pale hair hung dripping over her shoulders.</p>
    <p>Stark said gently, "What do you want with me?"</p>
    <p>She looked at him, so miserably like a wet puppy that he smiled. And as though that smile had taken what little resolution she had out of her, she dropped to her knees, sobbing.</p>
    <p>"I can't do it," she wailed. "He'll kill me, but I just can't do it!"</p>
    <p>"Do what?" asked Stark.</p>
    <p>She stared up at him. "Run away," she urged him. "Rim away now! You'll die in the swamps, but that's better than being one of the Lost Ones!" She shook her thin arms at him. "Run away!"</p>

    <p>The street was empty. Nothing showed, nothing stirred anywhere. Stark leaned over and pulled the girl to her feet, drawing her in under the shelter of the thatched eaves.</p>
    <p>"Now then," he said. "Suppose you stop crying and tell me what this is all about."</p>
    <p>Presently, between gulps and hiccoughs, he got the story out of her.</p>
    <p>"I am Zareth," she said. "Malthor's daughter. He's afraid of you, because of what you did to him on the ship, so he ordered me to watch for you in the square, when you would come out of the tavern. Then I was to follow you, and…"</p>
    <p>She broke off, and Stark patted her shoulder. "Go on."</p>
    <p>But a new thought had occurred to her. "If I do, will you promise not to beat me, or…" She looked at his gun and shivered.</p>
    <p>"I promise."</p>
    <p>She studied his face, what she could see of it in the darkness, and then seemed to lose some of her fear.</p>
    <p>"I was to stop you. I was to say what I've already said, about being Malthor's daughter and the rest of it, and then I was to say that he wanted me to lead you into an ambush while pretending to help you escape, but that I couldn't do it, and would help you escape anyhow because I hated Malthor and the whole business about the Lost Ones. So you would believe me, and follow me, and I would lead you into the ambush."</p>
    <p>She shook her head and began to cry again, quietly this time, and there was nothing of the woman about her at all now. She was just a child, very miserable and afraid. Stark was glad he had branded Malthor.</p>
    <p>"But I can't lead you into the ambush. I do hate Malthor, even if he is my father, because he beats me. And the Lost Ones…" She paused. "Sometimes I hear them at night, chanting way out there beyond the mist. It is a very terrible sound."</p>
    <p>"It is," said Stark. "I've heard it. Who are the Lost Ones, Zareth?"</p>
    <p>"I can't tell you that," said Zareth. "It's forbidden even to speak of them. And anyway," she finished honestly, "I don't even know. People disappear, that's all. Not our own people of Shuruun, at least not very often. But strangers like you—and I'm sure my father goes off into the swamps to hunt among the tribes there, and I'm sure he comes back from some of his voyages with nothing in his hold but men from some captured ship. Why, or what for, I don't know. Except I've heard the chanting."</p>
    <p>"They live out there in the gulf, do they, the Lost Ones?"</p>
    <p>"They must. There are many islands there."</p>
    <p>"And what of the Lhari, the Lords of Shuruun? Don't they know what's going on? Or are they part of it?"</p>
    <p>She shuddered, and said, "It's not for us to question the Lhari, nor even to wonder what they do. Those who have are gone from Shuruun, nobody knows where."</p>
    <p>Stark nodded. He was silent for a moment, thinking. Then Zareth's little hand touched his shoulder.</p>
    <p>"Go," she said. "Lose yourself in the swamps. You're strong, and there's something about you different from other men. You may live to find your way through."</p>
    <p>"No. I have something to do before I leave Shuruun." He took Zareth's damp fair head between his hands and kissed her on the forehead. "You're a sweet child, Zareth, and a brave one. Tell Malthor that you did exactly as he told you, and it was not your fault I wouldn't follow you."</p>
    <p>"He will beat me anyway," said Zareth philosophically, "but perhaps not quite so hard."</p>
    <p>"He'll have no reason to beat you at all, if you tell him the truth—that I would not go with you because my mind was set on going to the castle of the Lhari."</p>
    <p>There was a long, long silence, while Zareth's eyes widened slowly in horror, and the rain beat on the thatch, and fog and thunder rolled together across Shuruun.</p>
    <p>'To the castle," she whispered. "Oh, no! Go into the swamps, or let Malthor take you—but don't go to the castle!" She took hold of his arm, her fingers biting into his flesh with the urgency of her plea. "You're a stranger, you don't know…Please, don't go up there!"</p>
    <p>"Why not?" asked Stark. "Are the Lhari demons? Do they devour men?" He loosened her hands gently. "You'd better go now. Tell your father where I am, if he wishes to come after me."</p>
    <p>Zareth backed away slowly, out into the rain, staring at him as though she looked at someone standing on the brink of hell, not dead, but worse than dead. Wonder showed in her face, and through it a great yearning pity. She tried once to speak, and then shook her head and turned away, breaking into a run as though she could not endure to look upon Stark any longer. In a second she was gone.</p>
    <p>Stark looked after her for a moment, strangely touched. Then he stepped out into the rain again, heading upward along the steep path that led to the castle of the Lords of Shuruun.</p>
    <p>The mist was blinding. Stark had to feel his way, and as he climbed higher, above the level of the town, he was lost in the sullen redness. A hot wind blew, and each flare of lightning turned the crimson fog to a hellish purple. The night was full of a vast hissing where the rain poured into the gulf. He stopped once to hide his gun in a cleft between the rocks.</p>
    <p>At length he stumbled against a carven pillar of black stone and found the gate that hung from it, a massive thing sheathed in metal. It was barred, and the pounding of his fists upon it made little sound.</p>
    <p>Then he saw the gong, a huge disc of beaten gold beside the gate. Stark picked up the hammer that lay there, and set the deep voice of the gong rolling out between the thunderbolts.</p>
    <p>A barred slit opened and a man's eyes looked out at him. Stark dropped the hammer.</p>
    <p>"Open up!" he shouted. "I would speak with the Lhari!"</p>
    <p>From within he heard an echo of laughter. Scraps of voices came to him on the wind, and then more laughter, and then, slowly, the great valves of the gate creaked open, wide enough only to admit him.</p>
    <p>He stepped through, and the gateway shut behind him with a ringing clash.</p>
    <p>He stood in a huge open court. Enclosed within its walls was a village of thatched huts, with open sheds for cooking, and behind them were pens for the stabling of beasts, the wingless dragons of the swamps that can be caught and broken to the goad.</p>
    <p>He saw this only in vague glimpses, because of the fog. The men who had let him in clustered around him, thrusting him forward into the light that streamed from the huts.</p>
    <p>"He would speak with the Lhari!" one of them shouted, to the women and children who stood in the doorways watching. The words were picked up and tossed around the court, and a great burst of laughter went up.</p>
    <p>Stark eyed them, saying nothing. They were a puzzling breed. The men, obviously, were soldiers and guards to the Lhari, for they wore the harness of fighting men. As obviously, these were their wives and children, all living behind the castle walls and having little to do with Shuruun.</p>
    <p>But it was their racial characteristics that surprised him. They had interbred with the pale tribes of the Swamp-Edges that had peopled Shuruun, and there were many with milk-white hair and broad faces. Yet even these bore an alien stamp. Stark was puzzled, for the race he would have named was unknown here behind the Mountains of White Cloud, and almost unknown anywhere on Venus at sea level, among the sweltering marshes and the eternal fogs.</p>
    <p>They stared at him even more curiously, remarking on his skin and his black hair and the unfamiliar modeling of his face. The women nudged each other and whispered, giggling, and one of them said aloud, "They'll need a barrel-hoop to collar that neck!"</p>
    <p>The guards closed in around him. "Well, if you wish to see the Lhari, you shall," said the leader, "but first we must make sure of you."</p>
    <p>Spear-points ringed him round. Stark made no resistance while they stripped him of all he had, except for his shorts and sandals. He had expected that, and it amused him, for there was little enough for them to take.</p>
    <p>"All right," said the leader. "Come on."</p>
    <p>The whole village turned out in the rain to escort Stark to the castle door. There was about them the same ominous interest that the people of Shuruun had had, with one difference. They knew what was supposed to happen to him, knew all about it, and were therefore doubly appreciative of the game.</p>
    <p>The great doorway was square and plain, and yet neither crude nor ungraceful. The castle itself was built of the black stone, each block perfectly cut and fitted, and the door itself was sheathed in the same metal as the gate, darkened but not corroded.</p>
    <p>The leader of the guard cried out to the warder, "Here is one who would speak with the Lhari!"</p>
    <p>The warder laughed. "And so he shall! Their night is long, and dull."</p>
    <p>He flung open the heavy door and cried the word down the hallway. Stark could hear it echoing hollowly within, and presently from the shadows came servants clad in silks and wearing jeweled collars, and from the guttural sound of their laughter Stark knew that they had no tongues.</p>
    <p>Stark faltered, then. The doorway loomed hollowly before him, and it came to him suddenly that evil lay behind it and that perhaps Zareth was wiser than he when she warned him from the Lhari.</p>
    <p>Then he thought of Helvi, and of other things, and lost his fear in anger. Lightning burned the sky. The last cry of the dying storm shook the ground under his feet. He thrust the grinning warder aside and strode into the castle, bringing a veil of the red fog with him, and did not listen to the closing of the door, which was stealthy and quiet as the footfall of approaching Death.</p>
    <p>Torches burned here and there along the walls, and by their smoky glare he could see that the hallway was like the entrance—square and unadorned, faced with the black rock. It was high, and wide, and there was about the architecture a calm reflective dignity that had its own beauty, in some ways more impressive than the sensuous loveliness of the ruined palaces he had seen on Mars.</p>
    <p>There were no carvings here, no paintings nor frescoes. It seemed that the builders had felt that the hall itself was enough, in its massive perfection of line and the somber gleam of polished stone. The only decoration was in the window embrasures. These were empty now, open to the sky with the red fog wreathing through them, but there were still scraps of jewel-toned panes clinging to the fretwork, to show what they had once been.</p>
    <p>A strange feeling swept over Stark. Because of his wild upbringing, he was abnormally sensitive to the sort of impressions that most men receive either dully or not at all.</p>
    <p>Walking down the hall, preceded by the tongueless creatures in their bright silks and blazing collars, he was struck by a subtle difference in the place. The castle itself was only an extension of the minds of its builders, a dream shaped into reality. Stark felt that that dark, cool, curiously timeless dream had not originated in a mind like his own, nor like that of any man he had ever seen.</p>
    <p>Then the end of the hall was reached, the way barred by low broad doors of gold fashioned in the same chaste simplicity.</p>
    <p>A soft scurrying of feet, a shapeless tittering from the servants, a glancing of malicious, mocking eyes. The golden doors swung open, and Stark was in the presence of the Lhari.</p>

    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>They had the appearance in that first glance, of creatures glimpsed in a fever-dream, very bright and distant, robed in a misty glow that gave them an illusion of unearthly beauty.</p>
    <p>The place in which the Earthman now stood was like a cathedral for breadth and loftiness. Most of it was in darkness, so that it seemed to reach without limit above and on all sides, as though the walls were only shadowy phantasms of the night itself. The polished black stone under his feet held a dim translucent gleam, depthless as water in a black tarn. There was no substance anywhere.</p>
    <p>Far away in this shadowy vastness burned a cluster of lamps, a galaxy of little stars to shed a silvery light upon the Lords of Shuruun.</p>
    <p>There had been no sound in the place when Stark entered, for the opening of the golden doors had caught the attention of the Lhari and held it in contemplation of the stranger. Stark began to walk toward them in this utter stillness.</p>
    <p>Quite suddenly, in the impenetrable gloom somewhere to his right, there came a sharp scuffling and a scratching of reptilian claws, a hissing and a sort of low angry muttering, all magnified and distorted by the echoing vault into a huge demoniac whispering that swept all around him.</p>
    <p>Stark whirled around, crouched and ready, his eyes blazing and his body bathed in cold sweat. The noise increased, rushing toward him. From the distant glow of the lamps came a woman's tinkling laughter, thin crystal broken against the vault. The hissing and snarling rose to hollow crescendo, and Stark saw a blurred shape bounding at him.</p>
    <p>His hands reached out to receive the rush, but it never came. The strange shape resolved itself into a boy of about ten, who dragged after him on a bit of rope a young dragon, new and toothless from the egg, and protesting with all its strength.</p>
    <p>Stark straightened up, feeling let down and furious—and relieved. The boy scowled at him through a forelock of silver curls. Then he called him a very dirty word and rushed away, kicking and hauling at the little beast until it raged like the father of all dragons and sounded like it, too, in that vast echo chamber.</p>
    <p>A voice spoke. Slow, harsh, sexless, it rang thinly through the vault. Thin—but a steel blade is thin, too. It speaks inexorably, and its word is final.</p>
    <p>The voice said, "Come here, into the light."</p>
    <p>Stark obeyed the voice. As he approached the lamps, the aspect of the Lhari changed and steadied. Their beauty remained, but it was not the same. They had looked like angels. Now that he could see them clearly, Stark thought that they might have been the children of Lucifer himself.</p>
    <p>There were six of them, counting the boy. Two men, about the same age as Stark, with some complicated gambling game forgotten between them. A woman, beautiful, gowned in white silk, sitting with her hands in her lap, doing nothing. A woman, younger, not so beautiful perhaps, but with a look of stormy and bitter vitality. She wore a short tunic of crimson, and a stout leather glove on her left hand, where perched a flying thing of prey with its fierce eyes hooded. * The boy stood beside the two men, his head poised arrogantly. From time to time he cuffed the little dragon, and it snapped at him with its impotent jaws. He was proud of himself for doing that. Stark wondered how he would behave with the beast when it had grown its fangs.</p>
    <p>Opposite him, crouched on a heap of cushions, was a third man. He was deformed, with an ungainly body and long spidery arms, and in his lap a sharp knife lay on a block of wood, half formed into the shape of an obese creature half woman, half pure evil. Stark saw with a flash of surprise that the face of the deformed young man, of all the faces there, was truly human, truly beautiful. His eyes were old in his boyish face, wise, and very sad in their wisdom. He smiled upon the stranger, and his smile was more compassionate than tears.</p>
    <p>They looked at Stark, all of them, with restless, hungry eyes. They were the pure breed, that had left its stamp of alienage on the pale-haired folk of the swamps, the serfs who dwelt in the huts outside.</p>
    <p>They were of the Cloud People, the folk of the High Plateaus, kings of the land on the farther slopes of the Mountains of White Cloud. It was strange to see them here, on the dark side of the barrier wall, but here they were. How they had come, and why, leaving their rich cool plains for the fetor of these foreign swamps, he could not guess. But there was no mistaking them—the proud fine shaping of their bodies, their alabaster skin, their eyes that were all colors and none, like the dawn sky, their hair that was pure warm silver.</p>
    <p>They did not speak. They seemed to be waiting for permission to speak, and Stark wondered which one of them had voiced that steely summons.</p>
    <p>Then it came again. "Come here—come closer." And he looked beyond them, beyond the circle of lamps into the shadows again, and saw the speaker.</p>
    <p>She lay upon a low bed, her head propped on silken pillows, her vast, her incredibly gigantic body covered with a silken pall. Only her arms were bare, two shapeless masses of white flesh ending in tiny hands. From time to time she stretched one out and took a morsel of food from the supply laid ready beside her, snuffling and wheezing with the effort, and then gulped the tidbit down with a horrible voracity.</p>
    <p>Her features had long ago dissolved into a shaking formlessness, with the exception of her nose, which rose out of the fat curved and cruel and thin, like the bony beak of the creature that sat on the girl's wrist and dreamed its hooded dreams of blood. And her eyes…</p>
    <p>Stark looked into her eyes and shuddered. Then he glanced at the carving half formed in the cripple's lap, and knew what thought had guided the knife.</p>
    <p>Half woman, half pure evil. And strong. Very strong. Her strength lay naked in her eyes for all to see, and it was an ugly strength. It could tear down mountains, but it could never build.</p>
    <p>He saw her looking at him. Her eyes bored into his as though they would search out his very guts and study them, and he knew that she expected him to turn away, unable to bear her gaze. He did not. Presently he smiled and said, "I have outstared a rock-lizard, to determine which of us should eat the other. And I've outstared the very rock while waiting for him."</p>
    <p>She knew that he spoke the truth. Stark expected her to be angry, but she was not. A vague mountainous rippling shook her and emerged at length as a voiceless laughter.</p>
    <p>"You see that?" she demanded, addressing the others. "You whelps of the Lhari—not one of you dares to face me down, yet here is a great dark creature from the gods know where who can stand and shame you."</p>
    <p>She glanced again at Stark. "What demon's blood brought you forth, that you have learned neither prudence nor fear?"</p>
    <p>Stark answered somberly, "I learned them both before I could walk. But I learned another thing also—a thing called anger."</p>
    <p>"And you are angry?"</p>
    <p>"Ask Malthor if I am, and why!"</p>
    <p>He saw the two men start a little, and a slow smile crossed the girl's face.</p>
    <p>"Malthor," said the hulk upon the bed, and ate a mouthful of roast meat dripping with fat. "That is interesting. But rage against Malthor did not bring you here. I am curious, Stranger. Speak."</p>
    <p>"I will."</p>
    <p>Stark glanced around. The place was a tomb, a trap. The very air smelled of danger. The younger folk watched him in silence. Not one of them had spoken since he came in, except the boy who had cursed him, and that was unnatural in itself. The girl leaned forward, idly stroking the creature on her wrist so that it stirred and ran its knife-like talons in and out of their bony sheaths with sensuous pleasure. Her gaze on Stark was bold and cool, oddly challenging. Of them all, she alone saw him as a man. To the others he was a problem, a diversion—something less than human.</p>
    <p>Stark said, "A man came to Shuruun at the time of the last rains. His name was Helvi, and he was son of a little king by Yarell. He came seeking his brother, who had broken taboo and fled for his life. Helvi came to tell him that the ban was lifted, and he might return. Neither one came back."</p>
    <p>The small evil eyes were amused, blinking in their tallowy creases. "And so?"</p>
    <p>"And so I have come after Helvi, who is my friend."</p>
    <p>Again there was the heaving of that bulk of flesh, the explosion of laughter that hissed and wheezed in snakelike echoes through the vault.</p>
    <p>"Friendship must run deep with you, Stranger. Ah, well. The Lhari are kind of heart. You shall find your friend."</p>
    <p>And as though that were the signal to end their deferential silence, the younger folk burst into laughter also, until the vast hall rang with it, giving back a sound like demons laughing on the edge of Hell.</p>
    <p>The cripple only did not laugh, but bent his bright head over his carving, and sighed.</p>
    <p>The girl sprang up. "Not yet, Grandmother! Keep him awhile."</p>
    <p>The cold, cruel eyes shifted to her. "And what will you do with him, Varra? Haul him about on a string, like Bor with his wretched beast?"</p>
    <p>"Perhaps—though I think it would need a stout chain to hold him." Varra turned and looked at Stark, bold and bright, taking in the breadth and the height of him, the shaping of the great smooth muscles, the iron line of the jaw. She smiled. Her mouth was very lovely, like the red fruit of the swamp tree that bears death in its pungent sweetness.</p>
    <p>"Here is a man," she said. "The first man I have seen since my father died."</p>
    <p>The two men at the gaming table rose, their faces flushed and angry. One of them strode forward and gripped the girl's arm roughly.</p>
    <p>"So I am not a man," he said, with surprising gentleness. "A sad thing, for one who is to be your husband. It's best that we settle that now, before we wed."</p>
    <p>Varra nodded. Stark saw that the man's fingers were cutting savagely into the firm muscle of her arm, but she did not wince.</p>
    <p>"High time to settle it all, Egil. You have borne enough from me. The day is long overdue for my taming. I must learn now to bend my neck, and acknowledge my lord."</p>
    <p>For a moment Stark thought she meant it, the note of mockery in her voice was so subtle. Then the woman in white, who all this time had not moved nor changed expression, voiced again the thin, tinkling laugh he had heard once before. From that, and the dark suffusion of blood in Egil's face, Stark knew that Varra was only casting the man's own phrases back at him. The boy let out one derisive bark, and was cuffed into silence.</p>
    <p>Varra looked straight at Stark. "Will you fight for me?" she demanded.</p>
    <p>Quite suddenly, it was Stark's turn to laugh. "No!" he said.</p>
    <p>Varra shrugged. "Very well, then. I must fight for myself."</p>
    <p>"Man," snarled Egil. "I'll show you who's a man, you scapegrace little vixen!"</p>
    <p>He wrenched off his girdle with his free hand, at the same time bending the girl around so he could get a fair shot at her. The creature of prey clung to her wrist, beating its wings and screaming, its hooded head jerking.</p>
    <p>With a motion so quick that it was hardly visible, Varra slipped the hood and flew the creature straight for Egil's face.</p>
    <p>He let go, flinging up his arms to ward off the talons and the tearing beak. The wide wings beat and hammered. Egil yelled. The boy Bor got out of range and danced up and down shrieking with delight.</p>
    <p>Varra stood quietly. The bruises were blackening on her arm, but she did not deign to touch them. Egil blundered against the gaming table and sent the ivory pieces flying. Then he tripped over a cushion and fell flat, and the hungry talons ripped his tunic to ribbons down the back.</p>
    <p>Varra whistled, a clear peremptory call. The creature gave a last peck at the back of Egil's head and flopped sullenly back to its perch on her wrist. She held it, turning toward Stark. He knew from the poise of her that she was on the verge of launching her pet at him. But she studied him and then shook her head.</p>
    <p>"No," she said, and slipped the hood back on. "You would kill it."</p>
    <p>Egil had scrambled up and gone off into the darkness, sucking a cut on his arm. His face was black with rage. The other man looked at Varra.</p>
    <p>"If you were pledged to me," he said, "I'd have that temper out of you!"</p>
    <p>"Come and try it," answered Varra.</p>
    <p>The man shrugged and sat down. "It's not my place. I keep the peace in my own house." He glanced at the woman in white, and Stark saw that her face, hitherto blank of any expression, had taken on a look of abject fear.</p>
    <p>"You do," said Varra, "and, if I were Arel, I would stab you while you slept. But you're safe. She had no spirit to begin with."</p>
    <p>Arel shivered and looked steadfastly at her hands. The man began to gather up the scattered pieces. He said casually, "Egil will wring your neck some day, Varra, and I shan't weep to see it."</p>
    <p>All this time the old woman had eaten and watched, watched and eaten, her eyes glittering with interest.</p>
    <p>"A pretty brood, are they not?" she demanded of Stark. "Full of spirit, quarreling like young hawks in the nest. That's why I keep them around me, so—they are such sport to watch. All except Treon there." She indicated the crippled youth. "He does nothing. Dull and soft-mouthed, worse than Arel. What a grandson to be cursed with! But his sister has fire enough for two." She munched a sweet, grunting with pride.</p>
    <p>Treon raised his head and spoke, and his voice was like music, echoing with an eerie loveliness in that dark place.</p>
    <p>"Dull I may be, Grandmother, and weak in body, and without hope. Yet I shall be the last of the Lhari. Death sits waiting on the towers, and he shall gather you all before me. I know, for the winds have told me."</p>
    <p>He turned his suffering eyes upon Stark and smiled, a smile of such woe and resignation that the Earthman's heart ached with it. Yet there was a thankfulness in it too, as though some long waiting was over at last.</p>
    <p>"You," he said softly, "Stranger with the fierce eyes. I saw you come, out of the darkness, and where you set foot there was a bloody print. Your arms were red to the elbows, and your breast was splashed with the redness, and on your brow was the symbol of death. Then I knew, and the wind whispered into my ear, 'It is so. This man shall pull the castle down, and its stones shall crush Shuruun and set the Lost Ones free.' "</p>
    <p>He laughed, very quietly. "Look at him, all of you. For he will be your doom!"</p>
    <p>There was a moment's silence, and Stark, with all the superstitions of a wild race thick within him, turned cold to the roots of his hair. Then the old woman said disgustedly, "Have the winds warned you of this, my idiot?"</p>
    <p>And with astonishing force and accuracy she picked up a ripe fruit and flung it at Treon.</p>
    <p>"Stop your mouth with that," she told him. "I am weary to death of your prophecies."</p>
    <p>Treon looked at the crimson juice trickling slowly down the breast of his tunic, to drip upon the carving in his lap. The half formed head was covered with it. Treon was shaken with silent mirth.</p>
    <p>"Well," said Varra, coming up to Stark, "what do you think of the Lhari? The proud Lhari, who would not stoop to mingle their blood with the cattle of the swamps. My half-witted brother, my worthless cousins, that little monster Bor who is the last twig of the tree—do you wonder I flew my falcon at Egil?"</p>
    <p>She waited for an answer, her head thrown back, the silver curls framing her face like wisps of storm-cloud. There was a swagger about her that at once irritated and delighted Stark. A hellcat, he thought, but a mighty fetching one, and bold as brass. Bold—and honest. Her lips were parted, midway between anger and a smile.</p>
    <p>He caught her to him suddenly and kissed her, holding her slim strong body as though she were a doll. He was in no hurry to set her down. When at last he did, he grinned and said, "Was that what you wanted?"</p>
    <p>"Yes," answered Varra. "That was what I wanted." She spun about, her jaw set dangerously. "Grandmother…"</p>
    <p>She got no farther. Stark saw that the old woman was attempting to sit upright, her face purpling with effort and the most terrible wrath he had ever seen.</p>
    <p>"You," she gasped at the girl. She choked on her fury and her shortness of breath, and then Egil came soft-footed into the light, bearing in his hand a thing made of black metal and oddly shaped, with a blunt, thick muzzle.</p>
    <p>"Lie back, Grandmother," he said. "I had a mind to use this on Varra—"</p>
    <p>Even as he spoke he pressed a stud, and Stark in the act of leaping for the sheltering darkness, crashed down and lay like a dead man. There had been no sound, no flash, nothing, but a vast hand that smote him suddenly into oblivion.</p>
    <p>Egil finished,—"but I see a better target."</p>

    </title>

    <p>Red. Red. Red. The color of blood. Blood in his eyes. He was remembering now. The quarry had turned on him, and they had fought on the bare, blistering rocks.</p>
    <p>Nor had N'Chaka killed. The Lord of the Rocks was very big, a giant among lizards, and N'Chaka was small. The Lord of the Rocks had laid open N'Chaka's head before the wooden spear had more than scratched his flank.</p>
    <p>It was strange that N'Chaka still lived. The Lord of the Rocks must have been full fed. Only that had saved him.</p>
    <p>N'Chaka groaned, not with pain, but with shame. He had failed. Hoping for a great triumph, he had disobeyed the tribal law that forbids a boy to hunt the quarry of a man, and he had failed. Old One would not reward him with the girdle and the flint spear of manhood. Old One would give him to the women for the punishment of little whips. Tika would laugh at him, and it would be many seasons before Old One would grant him permission to try the Man's Hunt.</p>
    <p>Blood in his eyes.</p>
    <p>He blinked to clear them. The instinct of survival was prodding him. He must arouse himself and creep away, before the Lord of the Rocks returned to eat him.</p>
    <p>The redness would not go away. It swam and flowed, strangely sparkling. He blinked again, and tried to lift his head, and could not, and fear struck down upon him like the iron frost of night upon the rocks of the valley.</p>
    <p>It was all wrong. He could see himself clearly, a naked boy dizzy with pain, rising and clambering over the ledges and the shale to the safety of the cave. He could see that, and yet he could not move.</p>
    <p>All wrong. Time, space, the universe, darkened and turned.</p>
    <p>A voice spoke to him. A girl's voice. Not Tika's and the speech was strange.</p>
    <p>Tika was dead. Memories rushed through his mind, the bitter things, the cruel things. Old One was dead, and all the others…</p>
    <p>The voice spoke again, calling him by a name that was not his own.</p>
    <p>Stark.</p>
    <p>Memory shattered into a kaleidoscope of broken pictures, fragments, rushing, spinning. He was adrift among them. He was lost, and the terror of it brought a scream into his throat.</p>
    <p>Soft hands touching his face, gentle words, swift and soothing. The redness cleared and steadied, though it did not go away, and quite suddenly he was himself again, with all his memories where they belonged.</p>
    <p>He was lying on his back, and Zareth, Malthor's daughter, was looking down at him. He knew now what the redness was. He had seen it too often before not to know. He was somewhere at the bottom of the Red Sea—that weird ocean in which a man can breathe.</p>
    <p>And he could not move. That had not changed, nor gone away. His body was dead.</p>
    <p>The terror he had felt before was nothing, to the agony that filled him now. He lay entombed in his own flesh, staring up at Zareth, wanting an answer to a question he dared not ask.</p>
    <p>She understood, from the look in his eyes.</p>
    <p>"It's all right," she said, and smiled. "It will wear off. You'll be all right. It's only the weapon of the Lhari. Somehow it puts the body to sleep, but it will wake again."</p>
    <p>Stark remembered the black object that Egil had held in his hands. A projector of some sort, then, beaming a current of high-frequency vibration that paralyzed the nerve centers. He was amazed. The Cloud People were barbarians themselves, though on a higher scale than the swamp-edge tribes, and certainly had no such scientific proficiency. He wondered where the Lhari had got hold of such a weapon.</p>
    <p>It didn't really matter. Not just now. Relief swept over him, bringing him dangerously close to tears. The effect would wear off. At the moment, that was all he cared about.</p>
    <p>He looked up at Zareth again. Her pale hair floated with the slow breathing of the sea, a milky cloud against the spark-shot crimson. He saw now that her face was drawn and shadowed, and there was a terrible hopelessness in her eyes. She had been alive when he first saw her—frightened, not too bright, but full of emotion and a certain dogged courage. Now the spark was gone, crushed out.</p>
    <p>She wore a collar around her white neck, a ring of dark metal with the ends fused together for all time.</p>
    <p>"Where are we?" he asked.</p>
    <p>And she answered, her voice carrying deep and hollow in the dense substance of the sea, "We are in the place of the Lost Ones."</p>
    <p>Stark looked beyond her, as far as he could see, since he was unable to turn his head. And wonder came to him.</p>
    <p>Black walls, black vault above him, a vast hall filled with the wash of the sea that slipped in streaks of whispering flame through the high embrasures. A hall that was twin to the vault of shadows where he had met the Lhari.</p>
    <p>"There is a city," said Zareth dully. "You will see it soon. You will see nothing else until you die."</p>
    <p>Stark said, very gently, "How do you come here, little one?"</p>
    <p>"Because of my father. I will tell you all I know, which is little enough. Malthor has been slaver to the Lhari for a long time. There are a number of them among the captains of Shuruun, but that is a thing that is never spoken of—so I, his daughter, could only guess. I was sure of it when he sent me after you."</p>
    <p>She laughed, a bitter sound. "Now I'm here, with the collar of the Lost Ones on my neck. But Malthor is here, too." She laughed again, ugly laughter to come from a young mouth. Then she looked at Stark, and her hand reached out timidly to touch his hair in what was almost a caress. Her eyes were wide, and soft, and full of tears.</p>
    <p>"Why didn't you go into the swamps when I warned you?"</p>
    <p>Stark answered stolidly, "Too late to worry about that now." Then, "You say Malthor is here, a slave?"</p>
    <p>"Yes." Again, that look of wonder and admiration in her eyes. "I don't know what you said or did to the Lhari, but the Lord Egil came down in a black rage and cursed my father for a bungling fool because he could not hold you. My father whined and made excuses, and all would have been well—only his curiosity got the better of him and he asked the Lord Egil what had happened. You were like a wild beast, Malthor said, and he hoped you had not harmed the Lady Varra, as he could see from Egil's wounds that there had been trouble.</p>
    <p>"The Lord Egil turned quite purple. I thought he was going to fall in a fit."</p>
    <p>"Yes," said Stark. "That was the wrong thing to say." The ludicrous side of it struck him, and he was suddenly roaring with laughter. "Malthor should have kept his mouth shut!"</p>
    <p>"Egil called his guard and ordered them to take Malthor. And when he realized what had happened, Malthor turned on me, trying to say that it was all my fault, that I let you escape."</p>
    <p>Stark stopped laughing.</p>
    <p>Her voice went on slowly, "Egil seemed quite mad with fury. I have heard that the Lhari are all mad, and I think it is so. At any rate, he ordered me taken too, for he wanted to stamp Malthor's seed into the mud forever. So we are here."</p>
    <p>There was a long silence. Stark could think of no word of comfort, and as for hope, he had better wait until he was sure he could at least raise his head. Egil might have damaged him permanently, out of spite. In fact, he was surprised he wasn't dead.</p>
    <p>He glanced again at the collar on Zareth's neck. Slave. Slave to the Lhari, in the city of the Lost Ones.</p>
    <p>What the devil did they do with slaves, at the bottom of the sea?</p>
    <p>The heavy gases conducted sound remarkably well, except for an odd property of diffusion which made it seem that a voice came from everywhere at once. Now, all at once, Stark became aware of a dull clamor of voices drifting towards him.</p>
    <p>He tried to see, and Zareth turned his head carefully so that he might.</p>
    <p>The Lost Ones were returning from whatever work it was they did.</p>
    <p>Out of the dim red murk beyond the open door they swam, into the long, long vastness of the hall that was filled with the same red murk, moving slowly, their white bodies trailing wakes of sullen flame. The host of the damned drifting through a strange red-litten hell, weary and without hope.</p>
    <p>One by one they sank onto pallets laid in rows on the black stone floor, and lay there, utterly exhausted, their pale hair lifting and floating with the slow eddies of the sea. And each one wore a collar.</p>
    <p>One man did not lie down. He came toward Stark, a tall barbarian who drew himself with great strokes of his arms so that he was wrapped in wheeling sparks. Stark knew his face.</p>
    <p>"Helvi," he said, and smiled in welcome.</p>
    <p>"Brother!"</p>
    <p>Helvi crouched down—a great handsome boy he had been the last time Stark saw him, but he was a man now, with all the laughter turned to grim deep lines around his mouth and the bones of his face standing out like granite ridges.</p>
    <p>"Brother," he said again, looking at Stark through a glitter of unashamed tears. "Fool." And he cursed Stark savagely because he had come to Shuruun to look for an idiot who had gone the same way, and was already as good as dead.</p>
    <p>"Would you have followed me?" asked Stark.</p>
    <p>"But I am only an ignorant child of the swamps," said Helvi. "You come from space, you know the other worlds, you can read and write—you should have better sense!"</p>
    <p>Stark grinned. "And I'm still an ignorant child of the rocks. So we're two fools together. Where is Tobal?"</p>
    <p>Tobal was Helvi's brother, who had broken taboo and looked for refuge in Shuruun. Apparently he had found peace at last, for Helvi shook his head.</p>
    <p>"A man cannot live too long under the sea. It is not enough merely to breathe and eat. Tobal overran his time, and I am close to the end of mine." He held up his hand and then swept it down sharply, watching the broken fires dance along his arms.</p>
    <p>"The mind breaks before the body," said Helvi casually, as though it were a matter of no importance.</p>
    <p>Zareth spoke. "Helvi has guarded you each period while the others slept."</p>
    <p>"And not I alone," said Helvi. "The little one stood with me."</p>
    <p>"Guarded me!" said Stark. "Why?"</p>
    <p>For answer, Helvi gestured toward a pallet not far away. Malthor lay there, his eyes half open and full of malice, the fresh scar livid on his cheek.</p>
    <p>"He feels," said Helvi, "that you should not have fought upon his ship."</p>
    <p>Stark felt an inward chill of horror. To lie here helpless, watching Malthor come toward him with open fingers reaching for his helpless throat…</p>
    <p>He made a passionate effort to move, and gave up, gasping. Helvi grinned.</p>
    <p>"Now is the time I should wrestle you, Stark, for I never could throw you before." He gave Stark's head a shake, very gentle for all its apparent roughness. "You'll be throwing me again. Sleep now, and don't worry."</p>
    <p>He settled himself to watch, and presently in spite of himself Stark slept, with Zareth curled at his feet like a little dog.</p>
    <p>There was no time down there in the heart of the Red Sea. No daylight, no dawn, no space of darkness. No winds blew, no rain nor storm broke the endless silence. Only the lazy currents whispered by on their way to nowhere, and the red sparks, danced, and the great hall waited, remembering the past.</p>
    <p>Stark waited, too. How long he never knew, but he was used to waiting. He had learned his patience on the knees of the great mountains whose heads lift proudly into open space to look at the Sun, and he had absorbed their own contempt for time.</p>
    <p>Little by little, life returned to his body. A mongrel guard came now and again to examine him, pricking Stark's flesh with his knife to test the reaction, so that Stark should not malinger.</p>
    <p>He reckoned without Stark's control. The Earthman bore his prodding without so much as a twitch until his limbs were completely his own again. Then he sprang up and pitched the man half the length of the hall, turning over and over, yelling with startled anger.</p>
    <p>At the next period of labor, Stark was driven with the rest out into the City of the Lost Ones.</p>

     <p>VII</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Stark had been in places before that oppressed him with a sense of their strangeness or their wickedness—Sinharat, the lovely ruin of coral and gold lost in the Martin wastes; Jekkara, Valkis—the Low-Canal towns that smell of blood and wine; the cliff-caves of Arianrhod on the edge of Darkside, the buried tomb-cities of Callisto. But this—this was nightmare to haunt a man's dreams.</p>
    <p>He stared about him as he went in the long line of slaves, and felt such a cold shuddering contraction of his belly as he had never known before.</p>
    <p>Wide avenues paved with polished blocks of stone, perfect as ebon mirrors. Buildings, tall and stately, pure and plain, with a calm strength that could outlast the ages. Black, all black, with no fripperies of paint or carving to soften them, only here and there a window like a drowned jewel glinting through the red.</p>
    <p>Vines like drifts of snow cascading down the stones. Gardens with close-clipped turf and flowers lifting bright on their green stalks, their petals open to a daylight that was gone, their heads bending as though to some forgotten breeze. All neat, all tended, the branches pruned, the fresh soil turned this morning—by whose hand?</p>
    <p>Stark remembered the great forest dreaming at the bottom of the gulf, and shivered. He did not like to think how long ago these flowers must have opened their young bloom to the last light they were ever going to see. For they were dead—dead as the forest, dead as the city. Forever bright—and dead.</p>
    <p>Stark thought that it must always have been a silent city. It was impossible to imagine noisy throngs flocking to a market square down those immense avenues. The black walls were not made to echo song or laughter. Even the children must have moved quietly along the garden paths, small wise creatures born to an ancient dignity.</p>
    <p>He was beginning to understand now the meaning of that weird forest. The Gulf of Shuruun had not always been a gulf. It had been a valley, rich, fertile, with this great city in its arms, and here and there on the upper slopes the retreat of some noble or philosopher—of which the castle of the Lhari was a survivor.</p>
    <p>A wall of rock had held back the Red Sea from his valley. And then, somehow, the wall had cracked, and the sullen crimson tide had flowed slowly, slowly into the fertile bottoms, rising higher, lapping the towers and the tree tops in swirling flame, drowning the land forever. Stark wondered if the people had known the disaster was coming, if they had gone forth to tend their gardens for the last time so that they might remain perfect in the embalming gases of the sea.</p>
    <p>The columns of slaves, herded by overseers armed with small black weapons similar to the one Egil had used, came out into a broad square whose farther edges were veiled in the red murk. And Stark looked on ruin.</p>
    <p>A great building had fallen in the center of the square. The gods only knew what force had burst its walls and tossed the giant blocks like pebbles into a heap. But there it was, the one untidy thing in the city, a mountain of debris.</p>
    <p>Nothing else was damaged. It seemed that this had been the place of temples, and they stood unharmed, ranked around the sides of the square, the dim fires rippling through their open porticoes. Deep in their inner shadows Stark thought he could make out images, gigantic things brooding in the spark-shot gloom.</p>
    <p>He had no chance to study them. The overseers cursed them on, and now he saw what use the slaves were put to. They were clearing away the wreckage of the fallen building.</p>
    <p>Helvi whispered, "For sixteen years men have slaved and died down here, and the work is not half done. And why do the Lhari want it done at all? I'll tell you why. Because they are mad, mad as swamp-dragons gone musth in the spring!"</p>
    <p>It seemed madness indeed, to labor at this pile of rocks in a dead city at the bottom of the sea. It was madness. And yet the Lhari, though they might be insane, were not fools. There was a reason for it, and Stark was sure it was a good reason—good for the Lhari, at any rate.</p>
    <p>An overseer came up to Stark, thrusting him roughly toward a sledge already partly loaded with broken rocks. Stark hesitated, his eyes turning ugly, and Helvi said,</p>
    <p>"Come on, you fool! Do you want to be down flat on your back again?"</p>
    <p>Stark glanced at the little weapon, blunt and ready, and turned reluctantly to obey. And there began his servitude.</p>
    <p>It was a weird sort of life he led. For a while he tried to reckon time by the periods of work and sleep, but he lost count, and it did not greatly matter anyway.</p>
    <p>He labored with the others, hauling the huge blocks away, clearing out the cellars that were partly bared, shoring up weak walls underground. The slaves clung to their old habit of thought, calling the work-periods "days" and the sleep-periods "nights."</p>
    <p>Each "day" Egil, or his brother Cond, came to see what had been done, and went away black-browed and disappointed, ordering the work speeded up.</p>
    <p>Treon was there also much of the time. He would come slowly in his awkward crabwise way and perch like a pale gargoyle on the stones, never speaking, watching with his sad beautiful eyes. He woke a vague foreboding in Stark. There was something awesome in Treon's silent patience, as though he waited the coming of some black doom, long delayed but inevitable. Stark would remember the prophecy, and shiver.</p>
    <p>It was obvious to Stark after a while that the Lhari were clearing the building to get at the cellars underneath. The great dark caverns already bared had yielded nothing, but the brothers still hoped. Over and over Cond and Egil sounded the walls and the floors, prying here and there, and chafing at the delay in opening up the underground labyrinth. What they hoped to find, no one knew.</p>
    <p>Varra came, too. Alone, and often, she would drift down through the dim mist-fires and watch, smiling a secret smile, her hair like blown silver where the currents played with it. She had nothing but curt words for Egil, but she kept her eyes on the great dark Earthman, and there was a look in them that stirred his blood. Egil was not blind, and it stirred his too, but in a different way.</p>
    <p>Zareth saw that look. She kept as close to Stark as possible, asking no favors, but following him around with a sort of quiet devotion, seeming contented only when she was near him. One "night" in the slave barracks she crouched beside his pallet, her hand on his bare knee. She did not speak, and her face was hidden by the floating masses of her hair.</p>
    <p>Stark turned her head so that he could see her, pushing the pale cloud gently away.</p>
    <p>"What troubles you, little sister?"</p>
    <p>Her eyes were wide and shadowed with some vague fear. But she only said, "It's not my place to speak."</p>
    <p>"Why not?"</p>
    <p>"Because…" Her mouth trembled, and then suddenly she said, "Oh, it's foolish, I know. But the woman of the Lhari…"</p>
    <p>"What about her?"</p>
    <p>"She watches you. Always she watches you! And the Lord Egil is angry. There is something in her mind, and it will bring you only evil. I know it!"</p>
    <p>"It seems to me," said Stark wryly, "that the Lhari have already done as much evil as possible to all of us."</p>
    <p>"No," answered Zareth, with an odd wisdom. "Our hearts are still clean."</p>
    <p>Stark smiled. He leaned over and kissed her. "I'll be careful, little sister."</p>
    <p>Quite suddenly she flung her arms around his neck and clung to him tightly, and Stark's face sobered. He patted her, rather awkwardly, and then she had gone, to curl up on her own pallet with her head buried in her arms.</p>
    <p>Stark lay down. His heart was sad, and there was a stinging moisture in his eyes.</p>
    <p>The red eternities dragged on. Stark learned what Helvi had meant when he said that the mind broke before the body. The sea bottom was no place for creatures of the upper air. He learned also the meaning of the metal collars, and the manner of Tobal's death.</p>
    <p>Helvi explained.</p>
    <p>"There are boundaries laid down. Within them we may range, if we have the strength and the desire after work. Beyond them we may not go. And there is no chance of escape by breaking through the barrier. How this is done I do not understand, but it is so, and the collars are the key to it.</p>
    <p>"When a slave approaches the barrier the collar brightens as though with fire, and the slave falls. I have tried this myself, and I know. Half paralyzed, you may still crawl back to safety. But if you are mad, as Tobal was, and charge the barrier strongly…"</p>
    <p>He made a cutting motion with his hands.</p>
    <p>Stark nodded. He did not attempt to explain electricity or electronic vibrations to Helvi, but it seemed plain enough that the force with which the Lhari kept their slaves in check was something of the sort. The collars acted as conductors, perhaps for the same type of beam that was generated in the hand-weapons. When the metal broke the invisible boundary line it triggered off a force-beam from the central power station, in the manner of the obedient electric eye that opens doors and rings alarm bells. First a warning—then death.</p>
    <p>The boundaries were wide enough, extending around the city and enclosing a good bit of forest beyond it. There was no possibility of a slave hiding among the trees, because the collar could be traced by the same type of beam, turned to low power, and the punishment meted out to a retaken man was such that few were foolish enough to try that game.</p>
    <p>The surface, of course, was utterly forbidden. The one unguarded spot was the island where the central power station was, and here the slaves were allowed to come sometimes at night. The Lhari had discovered that they lived longer and worked better if they had an occasional breath of air and a look at the sky.</p>
    <p>Many times Stark made that pilgrimage with the others. Up from the red depths they would come, through the reeling bands of fire where the currents ran, through the clouds of crimson sparks and the sullen patches of stillness that were like pools of blood, a company of white ghosts shrouded in flame, rising from their tomb for a little taste of the world they had lost.</p>
    <p>It didn't matter that they were so weary they had barely the strength to get back to the barracks and sleep. They found the strength. To walk again on the open ground, to be rid of the eternal crimson dusk and the oppressive weight on the chest—to look up into the hot blue night of Venus and smell the fragrance of the liha-trees borne on the land wind…They found the strength.</p>
    <p>They sang here, sitting on the island rocks and staring through the mists toward the shore they would never see again. It was their chanting that Stark had heard when he came down the gulf with Malthor, that wordless cry of grief and loss. Now he was here himself, holding Zareth close to comfort her and joining his own deep voice into that primitive reproach to the gods.</p>
    <p>While he sat, howling like the savage he was, he studied the power plant, a squat blockhouse of a place. On the nights the slaves came guards were stationed outside to warn them away. The blockhouse was doubly guarded with the shock-beam. To attempt to take it by force would only mean death for all concerned.</p>
    <p>Stark gave that idea up for the time being. There was never a second when escape was not in his thoughts, but he was too old in the game to break his neck against a stone wall. Like Malthor, he would wait.</p>
    <p>Zareth and Helvi both changed after Stark's coming. Though they never talked of breaking free, both of them lost their air of hopelessness. Stark made neither plans nor promises. But Helvi knew him from of old, and the girl had her own subtle understanding, and they held up their heads again.</p>
    <p>Then, one "day" as the work was ending, Varra came smiling out of the red murk and beckoned to him, and Stark's heart gave a great leap. Without a backward look he left Helvi and Zareth, and went with her, down the wide still avenue that led outward to the forest</p>

    <p>They left the stately buildings and the wide spaces behind them, and went in among the trees. Stark hated the forest. The city was bad enough, but it was dead, honestly dead, except for those neat nightmare gardens. There was something terrifying about these great trees, full-leafed and green, rioting with flowering vines and all the rich undergrowth of the jungle, standing like massed corpses made lovely by mortuary art They swayed and rustled as the coiling fires swept them, branches bending to that silent horrible parody of wind. Stark always felt trapped there, and stifled by the stiff leaves and the vines.</p>
    <p>But he went, and Varra slipped like a silver bird between the great trunks, apparently happy.</p>
    <p>"I have come here often, ever since I was old enough. It's wonderful. Here I can stoop and fly like one of my own hawks." She laughed and plucked a golden flower to set in her hair, and then darted away again, her white legs flashing.</p>
    <p>Stark followed. He could see what she meant. Here in this strange sea one's motion was as much flying as swimming, since the pressure equalized the weight of the body. There was a queer sort of thrill in plunging headlong from the tree tops, to arrow down through a tangle of vines and branches and then sweep upward again.</p>
    <p>She was playing with him, and he knew it. The challenge got his blood up. He could have caught her easily but he did not, only now and again he circled her to show his strength. They sped on and on, trailing wakes of flame, a black hawk chasing a silver dove through the forests of a dream.</p>
    <p>But the dove had been fledged in an eagle's nest. Stark wearied of the game at last. He caught her and they clung together, drifting still among the trees with the momentum of that wonderful weightless flight.</p>
    <p>Her kiss at first was lazy, teasing and curious. Then it changed. All Stark's smoldering anger leaped into a different kind of flame. His handling of her was rough and cruel, and she laughed, a little fierce voiceless laugh, and gave it back to him, and he remembered how he had thought her mouth was like a bitter fruit that would give a man pain when he kissed it.</p>
    <p>She broke away at last and came to rest on a broad branch, leaning back against the trunk and laughing, her eyes brilliant and cruel as Stark's own. And Stark sat down at her feet.</p>
    <p>"What do you want?" he demanded. "What do you want with me?"</p>
    <p>She smiled. There was nothing sidelong or shy about her. She was bold as a new blade.</p>
    <p>"I'll tell you, wild man."</p>
    <p>He started. "Where did you pick up that name?"</p>
    <p>"I have been asking the Earthman Larrabee about you. It suits you well." She leaned forward. "This is what I want of you. Slay me Egil and his brother Cond. Also Bor, who will grow up worse than either—although that I can do myself, if you're averse to killing children, though Bor is more monster than child. Grandmother can't live forever, and with my cousins out of the way she's no threat. Treon doesn't count."</p>
    <p>"And if I do—what then?"</p>
    <p>"Freedom. And me. You'll rule Shuruun at my side."</p>
    <p>Stark's eyes were mocking. "For how long, Varra?"</p>
    <p>"Who knows? And what does it matter? The years take care of themselves." She shrugged. "The Lhari blood has run out, and it's time there was a fresh strain. Our children will rule after us, and they'll be men."</p>
    <p>Stark laughed. He roared with it.</p>
    <p>"It's not enough that I'm a slave to the Lhari. Now I must be executioner and herd bull as well!" He looked at her keenly. "Why me, Varra? Why pick on me?"</p>
    <p>"Because, as I have said, you are the first man I have seen since my father died. Also, there is something about you…"</p>
    <p>She pushed herself upward to hover lazily, her lips just brushing his.</p>
    <p>"Do you think it would be so bad a thing to live with me, wild man?"</p>
    <p>She was lovely and maddening, a silver witch shining among the dim fires of the sea, full of wickedness and laughter. Stark reached out and drew her to him.</p>
    <p>"Not bad," he murmured. "Dangerous."</p>
    <p>He kissed her, and she whispered, "I think you're not afraid of danger,"</p>
    <p>"On the contrary, I'm a cautious man." He held her off, where he could look straight into her eyes. "I owe Egil something on my own, but I will not murder. The fight must be fair, and Cond will have to take care of himself."</p>
    <p>"Fair! Was Egil fair with you—or me?"</p>
    <p>He shrugged. "My way, or not at all."</p>
    <p>She thought it over a while, then nodded. "All right. As for Cond, you will give him a blood debt, and pride will make him fight. The Lhari are all proud," she added bitterly. "That's our curse. But it's bred in the bone, as you'll find out."</p>
    <p>"One more thing. Zareth and Helvi are to go free, and there must be an end to this slavery."</p>
    <p>She stared at him. "You drive a hard bargain, wild man!"</p>
    <p>"Yes or no?"</p>
    <p>"Yes or no?"</p>
    <p>"Yes and no. Zareth and Helvi you may have, if you insist, though the gods know what you see in that pallid child. As to the other…" She smiled very mockingly. "I'm no fool, Stark. You're evading me, and two can play that game."</p>
    <p>He laughed. "Fair enough. And now tell me this, witch with the silver curls—how am I to get at Egil that I may kill him?"</p>
    <p>"I'll arrange that."</p>
    <p>She said it with such vicious assurance that he was pretty sure she would arrange it. He was silent for a moment, and then he asked,</p>
    <p>"Varra—what are the Lhari searching for at the bottom of the sea?"</p>
    <p>She answered slowly, "I told you that we are a proud clan. We were driven out of the High Plateaus centuries ago because of our pride. Now it's all we have left, but it's a driving thing."</p>
    <p>She paused, and then went on. "I think we had known about the city for a long time, but it had never meant anything until my father became fascinated by it. He would stay down here days at a time, exploring,, and it was he who found the weapons and the machine of power which is on the island. Then he found the chart and the metal book, hidden away in a secret place. The book was written in pictographs—as though it was meant to be deciphered—and the chart showed the square with the ruined building and the temples, with a separate diagram of catacombs underneath the ground.</p>
    <p>"The book told of a secret—a thing of wonder and of fear. And my father believed that the building had been wrecked to close the entrance to the catacombs where the secret was kept. He determined to find it."</p>
    <p>Sixteen years of other men's lives. Stark shivered. "What was the secret, Varra?"</p>
    <p>"The manner of controlling life. How it was done I do not know, but with it one might build a race of giants, of monsters, or of gods. You can see what that would mean to us, a proud and dying clan."</p>
    <p>"Yes," Stark answered slowly. "I can see."</p>
    <p>The magnitude of the idea shook him. The builders of the city must have been wise indeed in their scientific research to evolve such a terrible power. To mold the living cells of the body to one's will—to create, not life itself but its form and fashion…</p>
    <p>A race of giants, or of gods. The Lhari would like that. To transform their own degenerate flesh into something beyond the race of men, to develop their followers into a corps of fighting men that no one could stand against, to see that their children were given an unholy advantage over all the children of men…Stark was appalled at the realization of the evil they could do if they ever found that secret.</p>
    <p>Varra said, "There was a warning in the book. The meaning of it was not quite clear, but it seemed that the ancient ones felt that they had sinned against the gods and been punished, perhaps by some plague. They were a strange race, and not human. At any rate, they destroyed the great building there as a barrier against anyone who should come after them, and then let the Red Sea in to cover their city forever. They must have been superstitious children, for all their knowledge."</p>
    <p>"Then you all ignored the warning, and never worried that a whole city had died to prove it."</p>
    <p>She shrugged. "Oh, Treon has been muttering prophecies about it for years. Nobody listens to him. As for myself, I don't care whether we find the secret or not. My belief is it was destroyed along with the building, and besides, I have no faith in such things."</p>
    <p>"Besides," mocked Stark shrewdly, "you wouldn't care to see Egil and Cond striding across the heavens of Venus, and you're doubtful just what your own place would be in the new pantheon."</p>
    <p>She showed her teeth at him. "You're too wise for your own good. And now goodbye." She gave him a quick, hard kiss and was gone, flashing upward, high above the treetops where he dared not follow.</p>
    <p>Stark made his way slowly back to the city, upset and very thoughtful.</p>
    <p>As he came back into the great square, heading toward the barracks, he stopped, every nerve taut.</p>
    <p>Somewhere, in one of the shadowy temples, the clapper of a votive bell was swinging, sending its deep pulsing note across the silence. Slowly, slowly, like the beating of a dying heart it came, and mingled with it was the faint sound of Zareth's voice, calling his name.</p>
    <empty-line/>

    <empty-line/>
    <p>He crossed the square, moving very carefully through the red murk, and presently he saw her.</p>
    <p>It was not hard to find her. There was one temple larger than all the rest. Stark judged that it must once have faced the entrance of the fallen building, as though the great figure within was set to watch over the scientists and the philosophers who came there to dream their vast and sometimes terrible dreams.</p>
    <p>The philosophers were gone, and the scientists had destroyed themselves. But the image still watched over the drowned city, its hand raised both in warning and in benediction.</p>
    <p>Now, across its reptilian knees, Zareth lay. The temple was open on all sides, and Stark could see her clearly, a little white scrap of humanity against the black unhuman figure.</p>
    <p>Malthor stood beside her. It was he who had been tolling the votive bell. He had stopped now, and Zareth's words came clearly to Stark.</p>
    <p>"Go away, go away! They're waiting for you. Don't come in here!"</p>
    <p>"I'm waiting for you, Stark," Malthor called out, smiling. "Are you afraid to come?" And he took Zareth by the hair and struck her, slowly and deliberately, twice across the face.</p>
    <p>All expression left Stark's face, leaving it perfectly blank except for his eyes, which took on a sudden lambent gleam. He began to move toward the temple, not hurrying even then, but moving in such a way that it seemed an army could not have stopped him.</p>
    <p>Zareth broke free from her father. Perhaps she was intended to break free.</p>
    <p>"Egil!" she screamed. "It's a trap…"</p>
    <p>Again Malthor caught her and this time he struck her harder, so that she crumpled down again across the image that watched with its jeweled, gentle eyes and saw nothing.</p>
    <p>"She's afraid for you," said Malthor. "She knows I mean to kill you if I can. Well, perhaps Egil is here also. Perhaps he is not. But certainly Zareth is here. I have beaten her well, and I shall beat her again, as long as she lives to be beaten, for her treachery to me. And if you want to save her from that, you outland dog, you'll have to kill me. Are you afraid?"</p>
    <p>Stark was afraid. Malthor and Zareth were alone in the temple. The pillared colonnades were empty except for the dim fires of the sea. Yet Stark was afraid, for an instinct older than speech warned him to be.</p>
    <p>It did not matter. Zareth's white skin was mottled with dark bruises, and Malthor was smiling at him, and it did not matter.</p>
    <p>Under the shadow of the roof and down the colonnade he went, swiftly now, leaving a streak of fire behind him. Malthor looked into his eyes, and his smile trembled and was gone.</p>
    <p>He crouched. And at the last moment, when the dark body plunged down at him as a shark plunges, he drew a hidden knife from his girdle and struck.</p>
    <p>Stark had not counted on that. The slaves were searched for possible weapons every day, and even a sliver of stone was forbidden. Somebody must have given it to him, someone…</p>
    <p>The thought flashed through his mind while he was in the very act of trying to avoid that death blow. Too late, too late, because his own momentum carried him onto the point…</p>
    <p>Reflexes quicker than any man's, the hair-trigger reactions of a wild thing. Muscles straining, the center of balance shifted with an awful wrenching effort, hands grasping at the fire-shot redness as though to force it to defy its own laws. The blade ripped a long shallow gash across his breast. But it did not go home. By a fraction of an inch, it did not go home.</p>
    <p>While Stark was still off balance, Malthor sprang.</p>
    <p>They grappled. The knife blade glittered redly, a hungry tongue eager to taste Stark's life. The two men rolled over and over, drifting and tumbling erratically, churning the sea to a froth of sparks, and still the image watched, its calm reptilian features unchangingly benign and wise. Threads of a darker red laced heavily across the dancing fires.</p>
    <p>Stark got Malthor's arm under his own and held it there with both hands. His back was to the man now. Malthor kicked and clawed with his feet against the backs of Stark's thighs, and his left arm came up and tried to clamp around Stark's throat. Stark buried his chin so that it could not, and then Malthor's hand began to tear at Stark's face, searching for his eyes.</p>
    <p>Stark voiced a deep bestial sound in his throat. He moved his head suddenly, catching Malthor's hand between his jaws. He did not let go. Presently his teeth were locked against the thumb-joint, and Malthor was screaming, but Stark could give all his attention to what he was doing with the arm that held the knife. His eyes had changed. They were all beast now, the eyes of a killer blazing cold and beautiful in his dark face.</p>
    <p>There was a dull crack, and the arm ceased to strain or fight. It bent back upon itself, and the knife fell, drifting quietly down. Malthor was beyond screaming now. He made one effort to get away as Stark released him, but it was a futile gesture, and he made no sound as Stark broke his neck.</p>
    <p>He thrust the body from him. It drifted away, moving lazily with the suck of the currents through the colonnade, now and again touching a black pillar as though in casual wonder, wandering out at last into the square. Malthor was in no hurry. He had all eternity before him.</p>
    <p>Stark moved carefully away from the girl, who was trying feebly now to sit up on the knees of the image. He called out, to some unseen presence hidden in the shadows under the roof,</p>
    <p>"Malthor screamed your name, Egil. Why didn't you come?"</p>
    <p>There was a flicker of movement in the intense darkness of the ledge at the top of the pillars.</p>
    <p>"Why should I?" asked the Lord Egil of the Lhari. "I offered him his freedom if he could kill you, but it seems he could not—even though I gave him a knife, and drugs to keep your friend Helvi out of the way."</p>
    <p>He came out where Stark could see him, very handsome in a tunic of yellow silk, the blunt black weapon in his hands.</p>
    <p>"The important thing was to bait a trap. You would not face me because of this—" He raised the weapon. "I might have killed you as you worked, of course, but my family would have had hard things to say about that. You're a phenomenally good slave."</p>
    <p>"They'd have said hard words like 'coward,' Egil," Stark said softly. "And Varra would have set her bird at you in earnest."</p>
    <p>Egil nodded. His lip curved cruelly. "Exactly. That amused you, didn't it? And now my little cousin is training another falcon to swoop at me. She hooded you today, didn't she, Outlander?"</p>
    <p>He laughed. "Ah well. I didn't kill you openly because there's a better way. Do you think I want it gossiped all over the Red Sea that my cousin jilted me for a foreign slave? Do you think I wish it known that I hated you, and why? No. I would have killed Malthor anyway, if you hadn't done it, because he knew. And when I have killed you and the girl I shall take your bodies to the barrier and leave them there together, and it will be obvious to everyone, even Varra, that you were killed trying to escape."</p>
    <p>The weapon's muzzle pointed straight at Stark, and Egil's finger quivered on the trigger stud. Full power, this time. Instead of paralysis, death. Stark measured the distance between himself and Egil. He would be dead before he struck, but the impetus of his leap might carry him on, and give Zareth a chance to escape. The muscles of his thighs stirred and tensed.</p>
    <p>A voice said, "And will it be obvious how and why I died, Egil? For if you kill them, you must kill me too."</p>
    <p>Where Treon had come from, or when, Stark did not know. But he was there by the image, and his voice was full of a strong music, and his eyes shone with a fey light.</p>
    <p>Egil had started, and now he swore in fury. "You idiot! You twisted freak! How did you come here?"</p>
    <p>"How does the wind come, and the rain? I am not as other men." He laughed, a somber sound with no mirth in it. "I am here, Egil, and that's all that matters. And you will not slay this stranger who is more beast than man, and more man than any of us. The gods have a use for him."</p>
    <p>He had moved as he spoke, until now he stood between Stark and Egil.</p>
    <p>"Get out of the way," said Egil.</p>
    <p>Treon shook his head.</p>
    <p>"Very well," said Egil. "If you wish to die, you may."</p>
    <p>The fey gleam brightened in Treon's eyes. "This is a day of death," he said softly, "but not of his, or mine."</p>
    <p>Egil said a short, ugly word, and raised the weapon up.</p>
    <p>Things happened very quickly after that. Stark sprang, arching up and over Treon's head, cleaving the red gases like a burning arrow. Egil started back, and shifted his aim upward, and his finger snapped down on the trigger stud.</p>
    <p>Something white came between Stark and Egil, and took the force of the bolt.</p>
    <p>Something white. A girl's body, crowned with streaming hair, and a collar of metal glowing bright around the slender neck.</p>
    <p>Zareth.</p>
    <p>They had forgotten her, the beaten child crouched on the knees of the image. Stark had moved to keep her out of danger, and she was no threat to the mighty Egil, and Treon's thoughts were known only to himself and the winds that taught him. Unnoticed, she had crept to a place where one last plunge would place her between Stark and death.</p>
    <p>The rush of Stark's going took him on over her, except that her hair brushed softly against his skin. Then he was on top of Egil, and it had all been done so swiftly that the Lord of the Lhari had not had time to loose another bolt.</p>
    <p>Stark tore the weapon from Egil's hand. He was cold, icy cold, and there was a strange blindness on him, so that he could see nothing clearly but Egil's face. And it was Stark who screamed this time, a dreadful sound like the cry of a great cat gone beyond reason or fear.</p>
    <p>Treon stood watching. He watched the blood stream darkly into the sea, and he listened to the silence come, and he saw the thing that had been his cousin drift away on the slow tide, and it was as though he had seen it all before and was not surprised.</p>
    <p>Stark went to Zareth's body. The girl was still breathing, very faintly, and her eyes turned to Stark, and she smiled.</p>
    <p>Stark was blind now with tears. All his rage had run out of him with Egil's blood, leaving nothing but an aching pity and a sadness, and a wondering awe. He took Zareth very tenderly into his arms and held her, dumbly, watching the tears fall on her upturned face. And presently he knew that she was dead.</p>
    <p>Sometime later Treon came to him and said softly, "To this end she was born, and she knew it, and was happy. Even now she smiles. And she should, for she had a better death than most of us." He laid his hand on Stark's shoulder. "Come, I'll show you where to put her. She will be safe there, and tomorrow you can bury her where she would wish to be."</p>
    <p>Stark rose and followed him, bearing Zareth in his arms.</p>
    <p>Treon went to the pedestal on which the image sat. He pressed in a certain way upon a series of hidden springs, and a section of the paving slid noiselessly back, revealing stone steps leading down.</p>

    <p>Treon led the way down, into darkness that was lightened only by the dim fires they themselves woke in passing. No currents ran here. The red gas lay dull and stagnant, closed within the walls of a square passage built of the same black stone.</p>
    <p>"These are the crypts," he said. "The labyrinth that is shown on the chart my father found." And he told about the chart, as Varra had.</p>
    <p>He led the way surely, his misshapen body moving without hesitation past the mouths of branching corridors and the doors of chambers whose interiors were lost in shadow.</p>
    <p>"The history of the city is here. All the books and the learning, that they had not the heart to destroy. There are no weapons. They were not a warlike people, and I think that the force we of the Lhari have used differently was defensive only, protection against the beasts and the raiding primitives of the swamps."</p>
    <p>With a great effort, Stark wrenched his thoughts away from the light burden he carried.</p>
    <p>"I thought," he said dully, "that the crypts were under the wrecked building."</p>
    <p>"So we all thought. We were intended to think so. That is why the building was wrecked. And for sixteen years we of the Lhari have killed men and women with dragging the stones of it away. But the temple was shown also in the chart. We thought it was there merely as a landmark, an identification for the great building. But I began to wonder…"</p>
    <p>"How long have you known?"</p>
    <p>"Not long. Perhaps two rains. It took many seasons to find the secret of this passage. I came here at night, when the others slept."</p>
    <p>"And you didn't tell?"</p>
    <p>"No!" said Treon. "You are thinking that if I had told, there would have been an end to the slavery and the death. But what then? My family, turned loose with the power to destroy a world, as this city was destroyed? No! It was better for the slaves to die."</p>
    <p>He motioned Stark aside, then, between doors of gold that stood ajar, into a vault so great that there was no guessing its size in the red and shrouding gloom.</p>
    <p>"This was the burial place of their kings," said Treon softly. "Leave the little one here."</p>
    <p>Stark looked around him, still too numb to feel awe, but impressed even so.</p>
    <p>They were set in straight lines, the beds of black marble—lines so long that there was no end to them except the limit of vision. And on them slept the old kings, their bodies, marvelously embalmed, covered with silken palls, their hands crossed upon their breasts, their wise unhuman faces stamped with the mark of peace.</p>
    <p>Very gently, Stark laid Zareth down on a marble couch, and covered her also with silk, and closed her eyes and folded her hands. And it seemed to him that her face, too, had that look of peace.</p>
    <p>He went out with Treon, thinking that none of them had earned a better place in the hall of kings than Zareth.</p>
    <p>"Treon," he said.</p>
    <p>"Yes?"</p>
    <p>"That prophecy you spoke when I came to the castle—I will bear it out."</p>
    <p>Treon nodded. "That is the way of prophecies."</p>
    <p>He did not return toward the temple, but led the way deeper into the heart of the catacombs. A great excitement burned within him, a bright and terrible thing that communicated itself to Stark. Treon had suddenly taken on the stature of a figure of destiny, and the Earthman had the feeling that he was in the grip of some current that would plunge on irresistibly until everything in its path was swept away. Stark's flesh quivered.</p>
    <p>They reached the end of the corridor at last. And there, in the red gloom, a shape sat waiting before a black, barred door. A shape grotesque and incredibly misshapen, so horribly malformed that by it Treon's crippled body appeared almost beautiful. Yet its face was as the faces of the images and the old kings, and its sunken eyes had once held wisdom, and one of its seven-fingered hands was still slim and sensitive.</p>
    <p>Stark recoiled. The thing made him physically sick, and he would have turned away, but Treon urged him on.</p>
    <p>"Go closer. It is dead, embalmed, but it has a message for you. It has waited all this time to give that message."</p>
    <p>Reluctantly, Stark went forward.</p>
    <p>Quite suddenly, it seemed that the thing spoke.</p>
    <p>Behold me. Look upon me, and take counsel before you grasp that power which lies beyond the door!</p>
    <p>Stark leaped back, crying out, and Treon smiled.</p>
    <p>"It was so with me. But I have listened to it many times since then. It speaks not with a voice, but within the mind, and only when one has passed a certain spot."</p>
    <p>Stark's reasoning mind pondered over that. A thought-record, obviously, triggered off by an electronic beam. The ancients had taken good care that their warning would be heard and understood by anyone who should solve the riddle of the catacombs. Thought-images, speaking directly to the brain, know no barrier of time or language.</p>
    <p>He stepped forward again, and once more the telepathic voice spoke to him.</p>
    <p>"We tampered with the secrets of the gods. We intended no evil. It was only that we love perfection, and wished to shape all living things as flawless as our buildings and our gardens. We did not know that it was against the Law…</p>
    <p>"I was one of those who found the way to change the living cell. We used the unseen force that comes from the Land of the Gods beyond the sky, and we so harnessed it that we could build from the living flesh as the potter builds from the clay. We healed the halt and the maimed, and made those stand tall and straight who came crooked from the egg, and for a time we were as brothers to the gods themselves. I myself, even I, knew the glory of perfection. And then came the reckoning.</p>
    <p>"The cell, once made to change, would not stop changing. The growth was slow, and for a while we did not notice it, but when we did it was too late. We were becoming a city of monsters. And the force we had used was worse than useless, for the more we tried to mold the monstrous flesh to its normal shape, the more the stimulated cells grew and grew, until the bodies we labored over were like things of wet mud that flow and change even as you look at them.</p>
    <p>"One by one the people of the city destroyed themselves. And those of us who were left realized the judgment of the gods, and our duty. We made all things ready, and let the Red Sea hide us forever from our own kind, and those who should come after.</p>
    <p>"Yet we did not destroy our knowledge. Perhaps it was our pride only that forbade us, but we could not bring ourselves to do it. Perhaps other gods, other races wiser than we, can take away the evil and keep only the good. For it is good for all creatures to be, if not perfect, at least strong and sound.</p>
    <p>"But heed this warning, whoever you may be that listen. If your gods are jealous, if your people have not the wisdom or the knowledge to succeed where we failed in controlling this force, then touch it not! Or you, and all your people, will become as I."</p>
    <p>The voice stopped. Stark moved back again, and said to Treon incredulously, "And your family would ignore that warning?"</p>
    <p>Treon laughed. "They are fools. They are cruel and greedy and very proud. They would say that this was a lie to frighten away intruders, or that human flesh would not be subject to the laws that govern the flesh of reptiles. They would say anything, because they have dreamed this dream too long to be denied."</p>
    <p>Stark shuddered and looked at the black door. "The thing ought to be destroyed."</p>
    <p>"Yes," said Treon softly.</p>
    <p>His eyes were shining, looking into some private dream of his own. He started forward, and when Stark would have gone with him he thrust him back, saying, "No. You have no part in this." He shook his head.</p>
    <p>"I have waited," he whispered, almost to himself. "The winds bade me wait, until the day was ripe to fall from the tree of death. I have waited, and at dawn I knew, for the wind said, Now is the gathering of the fruit at hand."</p>
    <p>He looked suddenly at Stark, and his eyes had in them a clear sanity, for all their feyness.</p>
    <p>"You heard, Stark. 'We made those stand tall and straight who came crooked from the egg.' I will have my hour. I will stand as a man for the little time that is left."</p>
    <p>He turned, and Stark made no move to follow. He watched Treon's twisted body recede, white against the red dusk, until it passed the monstrous watcher and came to the black door. The long thin arms reached up and pushed the bar away.</p>
    <p>The door swung slowly back. Through the opening Stark glimpsed a chamber that held a structure of crystal rods and discs mounted on a frame of metal, the whole thing glowing and glittering with a restless bluish light that dimmed and brightened as though it echoed some vast pulse-beat. There was other apparatus, intricate banks of tubes and condensers, but this was the heart of it, and the heart was still alive.</p>
    <p>Treon passed within and closed the door behind him.</p>
    <p>Stark drew back some distance from the door and its guardian, crouched down, and set his back against the wall. He thought about the apparatus. Cosmic rays, perhaps—the unseen force that came from beyond the sky. Even yet, all their potentialities were not known. But a few luckless spacemen had found that under certain conditions they could do amazing things to human tissue.</p>
    <p>It was a line of thought Stark did not like at all. He tried to keep his mind away from Treon entirely. He tried not to think at all. It was dark there in the corridor, and very still, and the shapeless horror sat quiet in the doorway and waited with him. Stark began to shiver, a shallow animal-twitching of the flesh.</p>
    <p>He waited. After a while he thought Treon must be dead, but he did not move. He did not wish to go into that room to see.</p>
    <p>He waited.</p>
    <p>Suddenly he leaped up, cold sweat bursting out all over him. A crash had echoed down the corridor, a clashing of shattered crystal and a high singing note that trailed off into nothing.</p>
    <p>The door opened.</p>
    <p>A man came out. A man tall and straight and beautiful as an angel, a strong-limbed man with Treon's face, Treon's tragic eyes. And behind him the chamber was dark. The pulsing heart of power had stopped.</p>
    <p>The door was shut and barred again. Treon's voice was saying, "There are records left, and much of the apparatus, so that the secret is not lost entirely. Only it is out of reach."</p>
    <p>He came to Stark and held out his hand. "Let us fight together, as men. And do not fear. I shall die, long before this body changes." He smiled, the remembered smile that was full of pity for all living things. "I know, for the winds have told me."</p>
    <p>Stark took his hand and held it.</p>
    <p>"Good," said Treon. "And now lead on, stranger with the fierce eyes. For the prophecy is yours, and the day is yours, and I who have crept about like a snail all my life know little of battles. Lead, and I will follow."</p>
    <p>Stark fingered the collar around his neck. "Can you rid me of this?"</p>
    <p>Treon nodded. "There are tools and acid in one of the chambers."</p>
    <p>He found them, and worked swiftly, and while he worked Stark thought, smiling—and there was no pity in that smile at all.</p>
    <p>They came back at last into the temple, and Treon closed the entrance to the catacombs. It was still night, for the square was empty of slaves. Stark found Egil's weapon where it had fallen, on the ledge where Egil died.</p>
    <p>"We must hurry," said Stark. "Come on."</p>

     <p>XI</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>The island was shrouded heavily in mist and the blue darkness of the night. Stark and Treon crept silently among the rocks until they could see the glimmer of torchlight through the window-slits of the power station.</p>
    <p>There were seven guards, five inside the blockhouse, two outside to patrol.</p>
    <p>When they were close enough, Stark slipped away, going like a shadow, and never a pebble turned under his bare foot. Presently he found a spot to his liking and crouched down. A sentry went by not three feet away, yawning and looking hopefully at the sky for the first signs of dawn.</p>
    <p>Treon's voice rang out, the sweet unmistakable voice. "Ho, there, guards!"</p>
    <p>The sentry stopped and whirled around. Off around the curve of the stone wall someone began to run, his sandals thud-thudding on the soft ground, and the second guard came up.</p>
    <p>"Who speaks?" one demanded. "The Lord Treon?"</p>
    <p>They peered into the darkness, and Treon answered, "Yes." He had come forward far enough so that they could make out the pale blur of his face, keeping his body out of sight among the rocks and the shrubs that sprang up between them.</p>
    <p>"Make haste," he ordered. "Bid them open the door, there." He spoke in breathless jerks, as though spent. "A tragedy—a disaster! Bid them open!"</p>
    <p>One of the men leaped to obey, hammering on the massive door that was kept barred from the inside. The other stood goggle-eyed, watching. Then the door opened, spilling a flood of yellow torchlight into the red fog.</p>
    <p>"What is it?" cried the men inside. "What has happened?"</p>
    <p>"Come out!" gasped Treon. "My cousin is dead, the Lord Egil is dead, murdered by a slave."</p>
    <p>He let that sink in. Three or more men came outside into the circle of light, and their faces were frightened, as though somehow they feared they might be held responsible for this thing.</p>
    <p>"You know him," said Treon. "The great black-haired one from Earth. He has slain the Lord Egil and got away into the forest, and we need all extra guards to go after him, since many must be left to guard the other slaves, who are mutinous. You, and you—" He picked out the four biggest ones. "Go at once and join the search. I will stay here with the others."</p>
    <p>It nearly worked. The four took a hesitant step or two, and then one paused and said doubtfully,</p>
    <p>"But, my lord, it is forbidden that we leave our posts, for any reason. Any reason at all, my lord! The Lord Cond would slay us if we left this place."</p>
    <p>"And you fear the Lord Cond more than you do me," said Treon philosophically. "Ah, well. I understand."</p>
    <p>He stepped out, full into the light.</p>
    <p>A gasp went up, and then a startled yell. The three men from inside had come out armed only with swords, but the two sentries had their shock-weapons. One of them shrieked,</p>
    <p>"It is a demon, who speaks with Treon's voice!"</p>
    <p>And the two black weapons started up.</p>
    <p>Behind them, Stark fired two silent bolts in quick succession, and the men fell, safely out of the way for hours. Then he leaped for the door.</p>
    <p>He collided with two men who were doing the same thing. The third had turned to hold Treon off with his sword until they were safely inside.</p>
    <p>Seeing that Treon, who was unarmed, was in danger of being spitted on the man's point, Stark fired between the two lunging bodies as he fell, and brought the guard down. Then he was involved in a thrashing tangle of arms and legs, and a lucky blow jarred the shock-weapon out of his hand.</p>
    <p>Treon added himself to the fray. Pleasuring in his new strength, he caught one man by the neck and pulled him off. The guards were big men, and powerful, and they fought desperately. Stark was bruised and bleeding from a cut mouth before he could get in a finishing blow.</p>
    <p>Someone rushed past him into the doorway. Treon yelled. Out of the tail of his eyes Stark saw the Lhari sitting dazed on the ground. The door was closing.</p>
    <p>Stark hunched up his shoulders and sprang.</p>
    <p>He hit the heavy panel with a jar that nearly knocked him breathless. It slammed open, and there was a cry of pain and the sound of someone falling. Stark burst through, to find the last of the guards rolling every which way over the floor. But one rolled over onto his feet again, drawing his sword as he rose. He had not had time before.</p>
    <p>Stark continued his rush without stopping. He plunged headlong into the man before the point was clear of the scabbard, bore him over and down, and finished the man off with savage efficiency.</p>
    <p>He leaped to his feet, breathing hard, spitting blood out of his mouth, and looked around the control room. But the others had fled, obviously to raise the warning.</p>
    <p>The mechanism was simple. It was contained in a large black metal oblong about the size and shape of a coffin, equipped with grids and lenses and dials. It hummed softly to itself, but what its source of power was Stark did not know. Perhaps those same cosmic rays, harnessed to a different use.</p>
    <p>He closed what seemed to be a master switch, and the humming stopped, and the flickering light died out of the lenses. He picked up the slain guard's sword and carefully wrecked everything that was breakable. Then he went outside again.</p>
    <p>Treon was standing up, shaking his head. He smiled ruefully.</p>
    <p>"It seems that strength alone is not enough," he said. "One must have skill as well."</p>
    <p>"The barriers are down," said Stark. "The way is clear."</p>
    <p>Treon nodded, and went with him back into the sea. This time both carried shock weapons taken from the guards—six in all, with Egil's. Total armament for war.</p>
    <p>As they forged swiftly through the red depths, Stark asked, "What of the people of Shuruun? How will they fight?"</p>
    <p>Treon answered, "Those of Malthor's breed will stand for the Lhari. They must, for all their hope is there. The others will wait, until they see which side is safest. They would rise against the Lhari if they dared, for we have brought them only fear in their lifetimes. But they will wait, and see."</p>
    <p>Stark nodded. He did not speak again.</p>
    <p>They passed over the brooding city, and Stark thought of Egil and of Malthor who were part of that silence now, drifting slowly through the empty streets where the little currents took them, wrapped in their shrouds of dim fire.</p>
    <p>He thought of Zareth sleeping in the hall of kings, and his eyes held a cold, cruel light.</p>
    <p>They swooped down over the slave barracks. Treon remained on watch outside. Stark went in, taking with him the extra weapons.</p>
    <p>The slaves still slept. Some of them dreamed, and moaned in their dreaming, and others might have been dead, with their hollow faces white as skulls.</p>
    <p>Slaves. One hundred and four, counting the women.</p>
    <p>Stark shouted out to them, and they woke, starting up on their pallets, their eyes full of terror. Then they saw who it was that called them, standing collarless and armed, and there was a great surging and a clamor that stilled as Stark shouted again, demanding silence. This time Helvi's voice echoed his. The tall barbarian had wakened from his drugged sleep.</p>
    <p>Stark told them, very briefly, all that happened.</p>
    <p>"You are freed from the collar," he said. "This day you can survive or die as men, and not slaves." He paused, then asked, "Who will go with me into Shuruun?"</p>
    <p>They answered with one voice, the voice of the Lost Ones, who saw the red pall of death begin to lift from over them. The Lost Ones, who had found hope again.</p>
    <p>Stark laughed. He was happy. He gave the extra weapons to Helvi and three others that he chose, and Helvi looked into his eyes and laughed too.</p>
    <p>Treon spoke from the open door. "They are coming!"</p>
    <p>Stark gave Helvi quick instructions and darted out, taking with him one of the other men. With Treon, they hid among the shrubbery of the garden that was outside the hall, patterned and beautiful, swaying its lifeless brilliance in the lazy drifts of lire.</p>
    <p>The guards came. Twenty of them, tall armed men, to turn out the slaves for another period of labor, dragging the useless stones.</p>
    <p>And the hidden weapons spoke with their silent tongues.</p>
    <p>Eight of the guards fell inside the hall. Nine of them went down outside. Ten of the slaves died before the remaining three were overcome.</p>
    <p>Now there were twenty swords among ninety-four slaves, counting the women.</p>
    <p>They left the city and rose up over the dreaming forest, a flight of white ghosts with flames in their hair, coming back from the red dusk and the silence to find the light again.</p>
    <p>Light, and vengeance.</p>
    <p>The first pale glimmer of dawn was sifting through the clouds as they came up among the rocks below the castle of the Lhari. Stark left them and went like a shadow up the tumbled cliffs to where he had hidden his gun on the night he had first come to Shuruun. Nothing stirred. The fog lifted up from the sea like a vapor of blood, and the face of Venus was still dark. Only the high clouds were touched with pearl.</p>
    <p>Stark returned to the others. He gave one of his shock-weapons to a swamp-lander with a cold madness in his eyes. Then he spoke a few final words to Helvi and went back with Treon under the surface of the sea.</p>
    <p>Treon led the way. He went along the face of the submerged cliff, and presently he touched Stark's arm and pointed to where a round mouth opened in the rock.</p>
    <p>"It was made long ago," said Treon, "so that the Lhari and their slavers might come and go and not be seen. Come—and be very quiet."</p>
    <p>They swam into the tunnel mouth, and down the dark way that lay beyond, until the lift of the floor brought them out of the sea. Then they felt their way silently along, stopping now and again to listen.</p>
    <p>Surprise was their only hope. Treon had said that with the two of them they might succeed. More men would surely be discovered, and meet a swift end at the hands of the guards.</p>
    <p>Stark hoped Treon was right.</p>
    <p>They came to a blank wall of dressed stone. Treon leaned his weight against one side, and a great block swung slowly around on a central pivot. Guttering torchlight came through the crack. By it Stark could see that the room beyond was empty.</p>
    <p>They stepped through, and as they did so a servant in bright silks came yawning into the room with a fresh torch to replace the one that was dying.</p>
    <p>He stopped in mid-step, his eyes widening. He dropped the torch. His mouth opened to shape a scream, but no sound came, and Stark remembered that these servants were tongueless—to prevent them from telling what they saw or heard in the castle, Treon said.</p>
    <p>The man spun about and fled, down a long dim-lit hall. Stark ran him down without effort. He struck once with the barrel of bis gun, and the man fell and was still.</p>
    <p>Treon came up. His face had a look almost of exaltation, a queer shining of the eyes that made Stark shiver. He led on, through a series of empty rooms, all somber black, and they met no one else for a while.</p>
    <p>He stopped at last before a small door of burnished gold. He looked at Stark once, and nodded, and thrust the panels open and stepped through.</p>

     <p>XII</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>They stood inside the vast echoing hall that stretched away into darkness until it seemed there was no end to it. The cluster of silver lamps burned as before, and within their circle of radiance the Lhari started up from their places and stared at the strangers who had come in through their private door.</p>
    <p>Cond, and Arel with her hands idle in her lap. Bor, pummeling the little dragon to make it hiss and snap, laughing at its impotence. Varra, stroking the winged creature on her wrist, testing with her white finger the sharpness of its beak. And the old woman, with a scrap of fat meat halfway to her mouth.</p>
    <p>They had stopped, frozen, in the midst of these actions. And Treon walked slowly into the light.</p>
    <p>"Do you know me?" he said.</p>
    <p>A strange shivering ran through them. Now, as before, the old woman spoke first, her eyes glittering with a look as rapacious as her appetite.</p>
    <p>"You are Treon," she said, and her whole vast body shook.</p>
    <p>The name went crying and whispering off around the dark walls. Treon! Treon! Treon! Cond leaped forward, touching his cousin's straight strong body with hands that trembled.</p>
    <p>"You have found it," he said. "The secret."</p>
    <p>"Yes." Treon lifted his silver head and laughed, a beautiful ringing bell-note that sang from the echoing corners. "I found it, and it's gone, smashed, beyond your reach forever. Egil is dead, and the day of the Lhari is done."</p>
    <p>There was a long, long silence, and then the old woman whispered, "You lie!"</p>
    <p>Treon turned to Stark.</p>
    <p>"Ask him, the stranger who came bearing doom upon his forehead. Ask him if I lie."</p>
    <p>Cond's face became something less than human. He made a queer crazed sound and flung himself at Treon's throat.</p>
    <p>Bor screamed suddenly. He alone was not much concerned with the finding or the losing of the secret, and he alone seemed to realize the significance of Stark's presence. He screamed, looking at the big dark man, and went rushing off down the hall, crying for the guard as he went, and the echoes roared and racketed. He fought open the great doors and ran out, and as he did so the sound of fighting came through from the compound.</p>
    <p>The slaves, with their swords and clubs, with their stones and shards of rock, had come over the wall from the cliffs.</p>
    <p>Stark had moved forward, but Treon did not need his help. He had got his hands around Cond's throat, and he was smiling. Stark did not disturb him.</p>
    <p>The old woman was talking, cursing, commanding, choking on her own apoplectic breath. Arel began to laugh. She did not move, and her hands remained limp and open in her lap. She laughed and laughed, and Varra looked at Stark and hated him.</p>
    <p>"You're a fool, wild man," she said. "You would not take what I offered you, so you shall have nothing—only death."</p>
    <p>She slipped the hood from her creature and set it straight at Stark. Then she drew a knife from her girdle and plunged it into Treon's side.</p>
    <p>Treon reeled back. His grip loosened and Cond tore away, half throttled, raging, his mouth flecked with foam. He drew his short sword and staggered in upon Treon.</p>
    <p>Furious wings beat and thundered around Stark's head, and talons were clawing for his eyes. He reached up with his left hand and caught the brute by one leg and held it. Not long, but long enough to get one clear shot at Cond that dropped him in his tracks. Then he snapped the falcon's neck.</p>
    <p>He flung the creature at Varra's feet, and picked up the gun again. The guards were rushing into the hall now at the lower end, and he began to fire at them.</p>
    <p>Treon was sitting on the floor. Blood was coming in a steady trickle from his side, but he had the shock-weapon in his hands, and he was still smiling.</p>
    <p>There was a great boiling roar of noise from outside. Men were fighting there, killing, dying, screaming their triumph or their pain. The echoes raged within the hall, and the noise of Stark's gun was like a hissing thunder. The guards, armed only with swords, went down like ripe wheat before the sickle, but there were many of them, too many for Stark and Treon to hold for long.</p>
    <p>The old woman shrieked and shrieked, and was suddenly still.</p>
    <p>Helvi burst in through the press, with a knot of collared slaves. The fight dissolved into a whirling chaos. Stark threw his gun away. He was afraid now of hitting his own men. He caught up a sword from a fallen guard and began to hew his way to the barbarian.</p>
    <p>Suddenly Treon cried his name. He leaped aside, away from the man he was fighting, and saw Varra fall with the dagger still in her hand. She had come up behind him to stab, and Treon had seen and pressed the trigger stud just in time.</p>
    <p>For the first time, there were tears in Treon's eyes.</p>
    <p>A sort of sickness came over Stark. There was something horrible in this spectacle of a family destroying itself. He was too much the savage to be sentimental over Varra, but all the same he could not bear to look at Treon for a while.</p>
    <p>Presently he found himself back to back with Helvi, and as they swung their swords—the shock-weapons had been discarded for the same reason as Stark's gun—Helvi panted, "It has been a good fight, my brother! We cannot win, but we can have a good death, which is better than slavery!"</p>
    <p>It looked as though Helvi was right. The slaves, unfortunately, weakened by their long confinement, worn out by overwork, were being beaten back. The tide turned, and Stark was swept with it out into the compound, fighting stubbornly.</p>
    <p>The great gate stood open. Beyond it stood the people of Shuruun, watching, hanging back—as Treon had said, they would wait and see.</p>
    <p>In the forefront, leaning on his stick, stood Larrabee the Earthman.</p>
    <p>Stark cut his way free of the press. He leaped up onto the wall and stood there, breathing hard, sweating, bloody, with a dripping sword in his hand. He waved it, shouting down to the men of Shuruun.</p>
    <p>"What are you waiting for, you scuts, you women? The Lhari are dead, the Lost Ones are freed—must we of Earth do all your work for you?"</p>
    <p>And he looked straight at Larrabee.</p>
    <p>Larrabee stared back, his dark suffering eyes full of a bitter mirth. "Oh, well," he said in English. "Why not?"</p>
    <p>He threw back his head and laughed, and the bitterness was gone. He voiced a high, shrill rebel yell and lifted his stick like a cudgel, limping toward the gate, and the men of Shuruun gave tongue and followed him.</p>
    <p>After that, it was soon over.</p>
    <p>They found Bor's body in the stable pens, where he had fled to hide when the fighting started. The dragons, maddened by the smell of the blood, had slain him very quickly.</p>
    <p>Helvi had come through alive, and Larrabee, who had kept himself carefully out of harm's way after he had started the men of Shurrun on their attack. Nearly half the slaves were dead, and the rest wounded. Of those who had served the Lhari, few were left.</p>
    <p>Stark went back into the great hall. He walked slowly, for he was very weary, and where he set his foot there was a bloody print, and his arms were red to the elbows, and his breast was splashed with the redness. Treon watched him come, and smiled, nodding.</p>
    <p>"It is as I said. And I have outlived them all."</p>
    <p>Arel had stopped laughing at last. She had made no move to run away, and the tide of battle had rolled over her and drowned her unaware. The old woman lay still, a mountain of inert flesh upon her bed. Her hand still clutched a ripe fruit, clutched convulsively in the moment of death, the red juice dripping through her fingers.</p>
    <p>"Now I am going, too," said Treon, "and I am well content. With me goes the last of our rotten blood, and Venus will be the cleaner for it. Bury my body deep, stranger with the fierce eyes. I would not have it looked on after this."</p>
    <p>He sighed and fell forward.</p>
    <p>Bor's little dragon crept whimpering out from its hiding place under the old woman's bed and scurried away down the hall, trailing its dragging rope.</p>
    <p>Stark leaned on the taffrail, watching the dark mass of Shuruun recede into the red mists.</p>
    <p>The decks were crowded with the outland slaves, going home. The Lhari were gone, the Lost Ones freed forever, and Shuruun was now only another port on the Red Sea. Its people would still be wolf's-heads and pirates, but that was natural and as it should be. The black evil was gone.</p>
    <p>Stark was glad to see the last of it. He would be glad also to see the last of the Red Sea.</p>
    <p>The off-shore wind sent the ship briskly down the gulf. Stark thought of Larrabee, left behind with his dreams of winter snows and city streets and women with dainty feet. It seemed that he had lived too long in Shuruun, and had lost the courage to leave it.</p>
    <p>"Poor Larrabee," he said to Helvi, who was standing near him. "He'll die in the mud, still cursing it."</p>
    <p>Someone laughed behind him. He heard a limping step on the deck and turned to see Larrabee coming toward him.</p>
    <p>"Changed my mind at the last minute," Larrabee said. 'Tve been below, lest I should see my muddy brats and be tempted to change it again." He leaned beside Stark, shaking his head. "Ah, well, they'll do nicely without me. I'm an old man, and I've a right to choose my own place to die in. I'm going back to Earth, with you."</p>
    <p>Stark glanced at him. "I'm not going to Earth."</p>
    <p>Larrabee sighed. "No. No, I suppose you're not. After all, you're no Earthman, really, except for an accident of blood. Where are you going?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know. Away from Venus, but I don't know yet where."</p>
    <p>Larrabee's dark eyes surveyed him shrewdly. " 'A restless, cold-eyed tiger of a man,' that's what Varra said. He's lost something, she said. He'll look for it all his life, and never find it."</p>
    <p>After that there was silence. The red fog wrapped them, and the wind rose and sent them scudding before it.</p>
    <p>Then, faint and far off, there came a moaning wail, a sound like broken chanting that turned Stark's flesh cold.</p>
    <p>All on board heard it. They listened, utterly silent, their eyes wide, and somewhere a woman began to weep.</p>
    <p>Stark shook himself. "It's only the wind," he said roughly, "in the rocks by the strait."</p>
    <p>The sound rose and fell, weary, infinitely mournful, and the part of Stark that was N'Chaka said that he lied. It was not the wind that keened so sadly through the mists. It was the voices of the Lost Ones who were forever lost—Zareth, sleeping in the hall of kings, and all the others who would never leave the dreaming city and the forest, never find the light again.</p>
    <p>Stark shivered, and turned away, watching the leaping fires of the strait sweep toward them.</p>

    <p>THE WOMAN FROM ALTAIR</p>

     <p>I</p>
     <p>Ahrian</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>What a great day it was for everybody, when David came home from deep space. It was a day that will remain for a long while on the calendar of the McQuarrie family, marked heavily in red.</p>
    <p>We had driven down to the spaceport to meet him—myself, and Bet, who was David's and my sister, just out of college, and David's fiancée, a Miss Lewisham. The Miss Lewisham had family but no money, and David had both, and that was as far as it went. She was one of these handsome, shallow-eyed babes as perfectly machined as a chunk of bakelite, and just as human. Bet thought she was terrific. She had spent hours getting herself up to be as like her as possible, but it was all in vain. Bet's hair still behaved like hair, and blew.</p>
    <p>The spaceport was swarming. Interplanetary flight had long ago ceased to be a thing of breathless wonder to the populace, but star-ships were still new and rare, and the men who flew them were still heroic. Word had gone out that the Anson McQuarrie was due in from somewhere beyond the Pleiades, and there were thousands of people backed up behind the barricades. I remember that there were flags, and somebody had prepared a speech.</p>
    <p>"Isn't it wonderful!" said Bet, around a lump in her throat. "And all for David."</p>
    <p>"There are some other men on that ship, too," I said.</p>
    <p>"Oh, you always have to be so nasty," she snapped. "David's the captain, and the owner, too. And he deserves the reception."</p>
    <p>"Uh huh," I said, "and what's more, David himself would be the last to disagree with you."</p>
    <p>Officials were opening a way for us, and I shoved Bet along it with the Miss Lewisham, who headed like a homing duck for the TV cameras. At about that moment a feminine voice hailed us, and Bet whirled around, crying out, "Marthe!"</p>
    <p>An extremely attractive young woman detached herself from a group of obvious reporters and joined us.</p>
    <p>"I'm going to be quite shameless," she announced, "and presume on an old school friendship."</p>
    <p>I liked the way she grinned and practically dared me to throw her out of the family circle. I should have done so, but didn't because of that cheeky grin, and that's how Marthe Walters came to be mixed up in this mess. I wished so desperately afterward that I had pushed her face in. But how is one to know?</p>
    <p>Bet was offering explanations. "Marthe was a senior when I was a freshman, Rafe. Remember? That was when I was going to be a journalist." She rushed through the introductions, and memory clicked.</p>
    <p>"Oh, yes," I said. "You're the Marthe Walters who does those profile sketches for Public."</p>
    <p>"It's honest work, but it's a living."</p>
    <p>"You've come to the right place. My brother has the devil and all of a profile."</p>
    <p>She cocked her head on one side and gave me a peculiarly intelligent look. "Yours isn't so bad. And come to think of it, I've never heard of you."</p>
    <p>"I'm the forgotten McQuarrie," I said. "The one who didn't go to space."</p>
    <p>All this time we were being assisted onward to the place that had been reserved for the family. Bet was burbling, the Miss Lewisham was being statuesque and proud, and this bright-eyed intruder, Marthe, was thinking questions and trying to devise a politic way of asking them.</p>
    <p>"You're David's older brother?"</p>
    <p>"Ancient."</p>
    <p>"And you're a McQuarrie, and you didn't go to space." She shook her head. "That's like being a fish, and refusing to swim."</p>
    <p>"It's not Rafe's fault," said Bet, with that touch of womanly pity she could get in her voice sometimes. "How soon will he land, Rafe? I just can't wait!"</p>
    <p>I was trying to figure out what color Marthe's eyes were. I got them pegged for blue, and then there was some change in the light or something, and they were green as sea-water.</p>
    <p>"Surely," she said, "you didn't wash out."</p>
    <p>"No, it was noisier than that. I crashed. It was a light plane, but it came down heavy."</p>
    <p>"He was on his way to the spaceport from the Academy," said Bet sadly. "He had his papers and everything, and was going out on his first voyage as a junior officer. The disappointment nearly killed Father, Rafe being the oldest son and everything. But then, he still had David."</p>
    <p>"I see," said Marthe. She smiled at me, and this time it wasn't cheeky, but the sort of smile a man would like to see more of. "I'm sorry. I thought that walking stick was pure swank."</p>
    <p>"It is," I told her, and laughed. "I think that's what really disgusts the family—I'm healthy as a horse. I only carry the thing to remind them that I'm supposed to be frail."</p>
    <p>They were in radio communication with the Anson McQuarrie. The reports of position kept coming in, and an amplifier blatted them out. Men ran around looking harried, a million voices chattered, necks craned, the tension built up. The towers of Manhattan glittered mightily in the distance. Marthe and I talked. I think we talked about her.</p>
    <p>A great roar went up. Bet screamed in my ear. There was a perfect frenzy of sound for a few moments, and then there was silence, and in it the sky split open like tearing silk. A speck of silver came whistling down the cleft, growing rapidly, becoming a huge graceful creature with tarnished flanks and star-dust on her nose, and pride in every rivet. Oh, she was beautiful, and she settled light as a moonbeam on the landing field that had been cleared of any lesser craft. The Anson McQuarrie was home.</p>
    <p>I noticed then that Marthe had not been watching the ship at all. She was watching me.</p>
    <p>"You," she said, "are a rather puzzling person."</p>
    <p>"Does that bother you?"</p>
    <p>"I don't like a book that has the whole story on the first page."</p>
    <p>"Good," I said. "Then you won't like David. Come along. And oh, yes, any time you want to catch up on your reading—"</p>
    <p>"There he is!" shrieked Bet. "There's David!"</p>
    <p>The barricades were keeping back the crowds, and officials were forming a second line of defense against the mob of reporters. We, the family, were allowed to be first with our greetings. The under-hatch had opened in that vast keel, the platform was run out, and a tall figure in absolutely impeccable uniform had emerged onto it. Bands played, thousands cheered, the TV cameras rolled, and David lifted his hand and smiled. A handsome beggar, my brother, with all the best points of the McQuarrie stock. I think he was a little annoyed when Bet flung herself up the steps and onto his neck. She mussed his collar badly.</p>
    <p>I waved. The Miss Lewisham mounted to the platform, showing her splendid legs. She held out her arms graciously, prepared to grant David the dignified kiss due a hero from his future wife. But David gave her a horrified look as though he had forgotten all about her, and his face turned six different shades of red.</p>
    <p>He recovered magnificently. He caught those outstretched hands and shook them warmly, at the same time getting her off to one side so smoothly that she hardly realized it. Before she could say anything, he had spoken, to the world at large, with boyish pride.</p>
    <p>"I have seen," he said, "many strange and precious things on the worlds of other stars. And I have brought back with me the most wonderful of them all. I want you to welcome her to Earth."</p>
    <p>Here he turned to someone who had been waiting inside the hatch, and handed her out.</p>
    <p>I don't think that any of us, least of all the Miss Lewisham, caught on for a moment. We were too busy, like everybody else, staring at the little creature who was clinging to David's hand.</p>
    <p>She seemed incredibly small and fragile to be a grown woman, and yet that is what she was, and no mistake about it. She wore a very quaint drapery of some gossamer stuff that shimmered in the sunlight, and the lovely shape of her beneath it was something to wonder at. Her skin was perfectly white and beautiful, like fine porcelain, and her little face was pointed and fey-looking, with eyebrows that swept up toward her temples like two delicate feathers. Her hair was the color of amethysts. There was a great deal of it, piled high on her head in an intricate coiffure, and the lights in it were marvelous, as though every conceivable shade of that jewel had been melted and spun together and made alive. Her eyes, slanting under those sweeping brows, were the same color, but deeper, a true purple. They looked out in great bewilderment upon this noisy alien world.</p>
    <p>"She is from Altair," said David. "Her name is Ahrian. She is my wife."</p>
    <p>The reactions to that last simple statement were violent and more than a little confused. Sometime before the shouting died, and while Bet was still staring like an absolute idiot at her unexpected sister-in-law, the Miss Lewisham departed, with every hair still perfectly in place. Where her temper was, I don't know. The reporters stampeded, and no one and nothing could hold them back. The TV men were in transports when David kissed his little bride from Altair. I looked down at Marthe.</p>
    <p>"I suppose," I said, "it wouldn't be any good asking you to go away now."</p>
    <p>She said it wouldn't be. She was shivering slightly, like a wolf that has found a fat lamb asleep under its nose. "A woman from Altair," she whispered. "This isn't a story, it's a sensation."</p>
    <p>"It's certainly a surprise for the family!"</p>
    <p>"Poor little thing, she looks scared to death. Whatever you feel, don't take it out on her." Marthe glanced up at me, as though a sudden thought had occurred to her. "By the way," she asked, "is your brother quite right in the head?"</p>
    <p>"I'm beginning to wonder," I said.</p>
    <p>Up on the platform, the focus of the excitement, the new Mrs. David McQuarrie trembled against her husband and stared with those purple enigmatic eyes at the alien hosts of a world that was not her own.</p>

     <p>II</p>
     <p>Stranger on Earth</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Grimly we set off on the ride home. I had managed to get Bet on one side and threaten her with bodily injury if she didn't keep her mouth shut. David himself, what with the exultation of homecoming and the sensation he had created with his dramatic announcement of marriage, was flying too high to notice any of us too much. He held Ahrian in the circle of his arm as if she had been a child, and talked to her, and soothed her, and pointed out this and that interesting thing along the road.</p>
    <p>As she looked at the houses and trees, the hills and valleys, the sun and sky, I couldn't help being sorry for her. In my younger days I had gone, as supercargo in my father's ships, to Venus and Mars and beyond the Belt to Jupiter. I knew what it was like to walk on alien soiL And she was so far away from home that even her familiar sun was gone.</p>
    <p>She glanced at us now and then, with a kind of shy terror. Bet sulked and glowered, but I managed a smile, and Marthe patted Ahrian's hand. David had taught her English. She spoke it well, but with a curious rippling accent that made it sound like a foreign tongue.</p>
    <p>Her voice was soft and low and very sweet. She did not talk much. Neither did we.</p>
    <p>David barely noticed that we had a stranger with us. I had said vaguely that Marthe was a friend of mine, and he had nodded and forgot her. I was rather glad to have her along. There are times when families should not be alone together.</p>
    <p>The McQuarrie place is built on top of a rise. The house is large, and was originally built almost two centuries ago, when old Anson McQuarrie founded the family fortune with a fleet of ore carriers for the Lunar mines. There are old trees around it, and a thousand acres of land, and it is one of those places that exude from every pore a discreet odor of money.</p>
    <p>Ahrian looked at it and said dutifully, "It is very beautiful."</p>
    <p>"Not quite the sort of place she's used to," David remarked to us. "But she'll love it."</p>
    <p>I wondered if she would.</p>
    <p>We all piled out of the car, and Marthe hesitated. She had been so completely absorbed in studying Ahrian that I doubt if she had thought of her own position at all. Now the sight of our rather hulking house seemed to daunt her.</p>
    <p>"I think maybe I better go back now," she said. "I've imposed enough, and I've got a lot to go on. I'd like to really interview them both, but this is hardly the time for it."</p>
    <p>"Oh, no," I told her emphatically. "You're staying. Bet's got to have somebody to yak to, and it isn't going to be me. You're her old school chum, remember?"</p>
    <p>Marthe took a good look at Bet's furious countenance and muttered, "I have a feeling I'm going to hold this against you, Mr. McQuarrie."</p>
    <p>She was so right. Except that I held it against myself, the other way round.</p>
    <p>Suddenly Ahrian, who was a little distance up the walk with David, let out a quivering scream. David began to yell angrily for me. I went on to see what was the matter.</p>
    <p>"It's only Buck," I said.</p>
    <p>"Well, get him out of here. He's frightening Ahrian."</p>
    <p>"She might as well get used to him now," I said, and took Buck by the collar. He was a very large dog, and one of the best I ever had. He didn't like Ahrian. I could feel him shiver, and the hair on his back bristled under my hand.</p>
    <p>David was going to get ugly about it, and then Ahrian said, "It is that I have not before seen such a creature. It means no harm. Only it is uneasy."</p>
    <p>She began to talk to Buck, in her own soft liquid tongue. Gradually his muscles stilled and the hackles flattened and the ears relaxed. His eyes had a puzzled look. Presently he stalked forward and laid his head in her hands.</p>
    <p>Ahrian laughed. "You see? We are friends."</p>
    <p>I looked at the dog. There was no joy in him. Ahrian took her small white hands from his head. Abruptly he turned and went away, running fast.</p>
    <p>Ahrian said softly, "I have very much to learn."</p>
    <p>"Just the same," said David, glaring at me, "you be careful with your confounded livestock." He swept Ahrian on up the walk. The door had been opened. David did the inevitable thing. He picked Ahrian up in his arms and bore her with a courtly flourish across the threshold.</p>
    <p>"All I've got to say is," Bet snarled, "I hope they can't—I mean, I just couldn't bear it to have a little nephew with lavender hair!"</p>
    <p>She stamped on into the house. I took Marthe firmly by the arm. "Bet can fix you up with suitable garments."</p>
    <p>"What for?"</p>
    <p>"We are having a dinner tonight, in David's honor. Formal, of course. There will be many people."</p>
    <p>"How delightful," she said, and groaning, followed Bet.</p>
    <p>That dinner may not have been delightful, but it certainly was not dull. The drawing rooms teemed with what Daisy Ashford would have referred to as costly people, all quite ill at ease. Ahrian, sitting at the table in the place that was to have been the Miss Lewisham's, was a little figure fashioned in some Dresden of Fairyland, dressed in a matchless tissue of pale gold and crowned with that incredibly beautiful hair.</p>
    <p>The women didn't know how to deal with her, and the men were fascinated, and all in all it was not a sucessful social occasion. Late in the evening David made her sing. She had a curious stringed instrument from which she drew soft wandering music, and she sang songs of her own world that were sweet and very strange. Some of them didn't have any words. They told of the things that lie hid beyond mountains, and of the secrets oceans know, and of the long, still thoughts of deserts. But they were not the mountains or the deserts or the seas of Earth. Toward the end there came into her eyes two great crystal tears.</p>
    <p>Soon after that I noticed that she had disappeared. David was holding the center of the stage with some thrilling recital of events beyond the stars, and it seemed to be up to me to look for her.</p>
    <p>I found her at last, standing disconsolate on the steps that lead down from the terrace into the garden. There were many shadows in it, and the shrubs rustled in the wind, so that it must have seemed a frightening place to her. There were clouds, I remember, veiling the sky.</p>
    <p>She turned and looked at me. "Why did you come to me?"</p>
    <p>"I thought perhaps you might be lonely."</p>
    <p>"There is David," she answered. "Why might I be lonely?"</p>
    <p>I could not see her face, except as a small blurred whiteness in the gloom. "Yes," I said, "you have David. But it's still possible to be sad."</p>
    <p>She said, "I will not be sad." I could read nothing in the tone of her voice, either.</p>
    <p>"Ahrian, you must try to understand us. We were upset today, because we hadn't expected you, and—well—" I tried, rather lamely, to explain how things had stood. "It wasn't anything personal. You're part of the family now, and we'll do all we can to make you welcome."</p>
    <p>"The little one—she is full of anger."</p>
    <p>"She's just a kid. Give her time. A month from now she'll be wanting to dye her hair to match yours." I held out my hand. "We have a custom here of clasping hands as a token of friendship. Will you take mine, Ahrian?"</p>
    <p>She hesitated, a long moment.</p>
    <p>Then she said gravely, as if it were something I must remember, "I do not hate you, Rafe." She put her hand in mine, a fleeting touch as light and chill as the falling of a snowflake. Then she shivered. "It is cold on your world when the darkness comes."</p>
    <p>"Is it always warm on yours?" We started toward the house, and looking down at her beside me, I thought I could understand why David had not been able to let her go.</p>
    <p>She answered softly. "Yes, it is warm, and the moons are like bright lamps in the sky. The spires and the rooftops glisten, and there are dark leaves that shake out perfume—"</p>
    <p>She broke off, too quickly, and said no more.</p>
    <p>"You must love David very deeply to have come all this long way home with him."</p>
    <p>"Love is indeed a great force," she murmured.</p>
    <p>We went inside, and David claimed her again.</p>
    <p>For several days I did not see much of Ahrian. I handle the financial end of the McQuarrie business, not because I like it but because I have to do something to justify the money I spend. David had brought back an invaluable cargo, some of it from worlds that, like Ahrian's, had never been touched before. I think we cleared around a million dollars on it, over and above the cost of the voyage.</p>
    <p>I was so busy that I hardly had time to see Marthe. Strange, how important it had become to see Marthe, so quickly and without anything being said about it. She had left our house, of course, in high spirits over the inside stuff she had got for her articles. I had said, "When will I see you again?" And she had answered, "Any time." That's how it was—any time we could possibly make it.</p>
    <p>One night, when by chance the family were all together at dinner, Ahrian said shyly, "David, I have been thinking—"</p>
    <p>Instantly he was all attention. He really did seem to adore her. I will admit that I had a few sneaking suspicions, or perhaps it was only a puzzled wonder, since David so far in his life had had only three loves—star-ships, himself, and the McQuarrie name, in that order. But his manner with Ahrian appeared to show that he had found the fourth.</p>
    <p>"In my home," said Ahrian, "I had a small place that was my own, in which I found much pleasure in fashioning little gifts for those I loved. Only a very small place, David—might I have one here?"</p>
    <p>David smiled at her and said that she might have anything there was on Earth or the other planets, except the ugly domes that might be all right for Earthlings but were not for her. Ahrian smiled back, asking, still with that shy hesitance, for some gem stones of small value, and some fine wires of platinum and gold.</p>
    <p>"Diamonds," said David. "Emeralds. All you like."</p>
    <p>"No. I will have the crystal and the zircon. Uncut, please. I wish to shape them myself."</p>
    <p>"With those tiny hands? Very well, darling. I'll have them here tomorrow."</p>
    <p>Ahrian thanked him gravely and glanced across at me. "I am learning very quickly, Rafe. I have seen all your horses. They are a wonder to me, so large and beautiful."</p>
    <p>"If you like," I said, "I could teach you to ride."</p>
    <p>"Perhaps on that very little one?"</p>
    <p>I laughed and explained to her why a three-week foal was not suitable for that. David said fiercely that he was not going to have Ahrian trampled to death by one of my lubberly beasts, and forbade anything of the sort.</p>
    <p>After dinner I got Bet alone and asked her how she was making out with Ahrian.</p>
    <p>"Oh, I suppose it isn't her fault, but she gives me the creeps, Rafe! She goes drifting around the place like a funny little shadow, and sometimes the way she looks at you…I get the feeling she's studying me—way deep inside, I mean. I don't like it—and I don't like her!"</p>
    <p>"Well, try to be as nice as you can. The poor little critter must be having a hard enough time of it. Remember we're as alien to her as she is to us."</p>
    <p>"She wanted to come," said Bet, without pity. I left her, and went off to keep a date with Marthe…</p>

     <p>III</p>
     <p>Gifts of—Love</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>David fixed up a wonderful workshop for Ahrian, where she could make pretty trinkets to her heart's content. She would remain there for hours, humming softly to herself, letting no one, not even David, in to see what she was doing. She worked for weeks, and then one evening she came in to dinner with the pleased air of a child who has done a nice thing. I saw that she was carrying some light burden in a fold of her gown.</p>
    <p>She was wearing a kind of tiara that went very well with her masses of amethystine hair and her curious little face. It was a delicate thing, exquisitely wrought of mingled wires of platinum and gold woven into a strange design of flowers and set with a flawless crystal that she had cut herself in a way that I had never seen a crystal cut before.</p>
    <p>She strewed her small burden glittering on the tablecloth. "See! I have made a gift for everyone. You must wear them, or I shall be so unhappy!"</p>
    <p>They were beautiful. For David and me she had made rings—for, as she said, we did not wear jewels as the men of her world did, and so she had had to be content with rings. For Bet there was a necklace, of a sort that no girl could resist if the Devil, himself had given it to her.</p>
    <p>There was a chorus of astonished comment. David told Ahrian that she could make a fortune for herself if she would make and sell these things to the world. Ahrian shook her head.</p>
    <p>"No. These are gifts and must be fashioned with a meaning from the heart. Otherwise I could not make them."</p>
    <p>The stones were all most curiously cut.</p>
    <p>It was exactly eight days after that giving of gifts that the thing happened.</p>
    <p>David was away on some business in the city. Marthe was spending the weekend—Ahrian seemed an odd kind of chaperone, but we thought she would serve—and we had been taking a stroll in a wood that there is north of the house.</p>
    <p>All of a sudden we heard the sound of someone screaming.</p>
    <p>We started to run back toward the house. A scream has no identity, but somehow I knew this one came from Bet. Marthe got some distance ahead of me, and then she began to scream, too. There were other sounds mixed with the screaming. I made all the speed I could. Where the wood ended, there was a wide stretch of turf, with the house way at the back of it and here and there apple trees that were part of an old orchard.</p>
    <p>Bet had got herself up into one of these old thorny veterans. Her clothes were torn and there were dabbles of blood on her face and dress. Her cries had ceased to have any meaning. In a minute she was going to faint</p>
    <p>My big dog Buck was under the tree. He leaped and sprang, and his teeth flashed like knives in the sunlight, snapping shut no more than a short inch beneath the limb Bet huddled on. He moaned as he leaped, a strange and dreadful sound as though he were being tortured and were pleading for release.</p>
    <p>I shouted his name. He turned his head, gave me one pitiful look, and then he went back to trying to kill my sister. I was carrying the heavy blackthorn stick I used when I walked in the country. I hit him with the knob of it. Poor Buck! He was dead in a minute or two, as quick as I could make it, and he never tried to defend himself. I caught Bet as she tumbled out of the apple tree, and Marthe and I between us got her to the house.</p>
    <p>Ahrian was there. She gave a little cry of horror and bent her head, and I remember the flash of crystal on her forehead in the dim hall. Servants came and took Bet. Marthe ran off somewhere to be sick, and I called town for David and a doctor.</p>
    <p>For a while I was busy with brandy and restoratives. Presently Bet came around, more terrified than hurt. Her scratches had come mostly from climbing into the tree. She said she had been looking for Marthe and me, when suddenly Buck had appeared out of nowhere and, for no reason at all, tried to tear her throat out.</p>
    <p>"I never did him any harm," she whimpered. "I liked him, and he liked me. He must have gone mad."</p>
    <p>I was glad when the doctor came and put her under for a while. Buck was taken away for autopsy. He was not rabid, nor was there a sign of any other disease. I had that stick burned up. I couldn't forget the way Buck had moaned, the way he had looked at me before he died. David had some bitter words to say, and I nearly hit him, which was unfair under the circumstances.</p>
    <p>Anyway, the dog was dead, and Bet was all right. In time everybody's, nerves calmed down, and even Bet got tired of talking about it. David had a birthday coming up. Ahrian made great preparations, asking us all incessant questions about how things should be done according to our customs, and adding a few of her own.</p>
    <p>David liked lavishness, so there was another big dinner and a lot of people. Ahrian had gained confidence, and everybody had had time to gossip themselves out about her by now. It was a much more successful occasion than the first. Even some of the women decided not to hate her.</p>
    <p>Marthe and I retired into the library for a little quiet love-making. Between times we discussed getting married. Through the closed doors we heard Ahrian singing for a while, not the longing heartsick things she had sung before, but something gay and wicked. When she stopped, there was only the usual buzz and chatter of people.</p>
    <p>Some time went by, I don't know how much. Without any warning a terrible racket arose of horses squealing, and of yelling, and I remember thinking that the barns must be on fire.</p>
    <p>I got outside in a hurry. The guests were beginning to pour out onto the veranda and peer curiously into the darkness to see what the trouble was. Among them, I noticed Ahrian with a cloak around her.</p>
    <p>The stables and the big open paddocks are some distance from the house. Halfway there I saw Jamieson, my head groom, running toward me.</p>
    <p>"It's Miss Bet," he gasped, white-faced and shaking. "Hurry!"</p>
    <p>I hurried, but there was a cold, sick feeling in me that told me hurrying was no use.</p>
    <p>There was an old brood mare, gentle as a kitten, long past her usefulness and pensioned off. She was Bet's especial pet, and old Hazel would muster up a stiff-legged canter from wherever she was to come and snuffle over her for sugar-lumps.</p>
    <p>All the big floodlights were on. There was a confusion of men and horses and noise. Old Hazel was pressed up against the paddock fence, her coat dark with sweat, trembling in every muscle. There was blood on her legs. Bet was dead. In her long white party dress and her silver sandals she had come all the way down there and gone into the paddock, and the old mare had trampled her. It didn't make sense at all. I kneeled there beside her in the dirt, and the necklace of zircons that Ahrian had given her glittered among the splashes of blood.</p>
    <p>The men had got ropes on the mare now, and she began to thrash and scream like a crazy thing. Somebody handed me a gun, and I used it, all the time knowing that the poor old beast had no more killing in her than Buck had had.</p>
    <p>It made no kind of sense. But Bet was dead.</p>
    <p>It was a fine ending to a gay evening.</p>
    <p>You know how it is with a kid sister. Sometimes she's a pest, and sometimes she's ridiculous, and she always talks too much, but even so—And it was such an ugly way to die.</p>
    <p>David was going down and shoot every horse in the place. When I stopped him, he turned on me. There was a bad scene. They were my animals. One had tried, and one had succeeded, and that made me practically a murderer. I let it go, because he was hard hit, and so was I. But from then on there was a wall between me and my brother, and the hate he had against me over Bet's death seemed to grow day by day. I couldn't understand why. It seemed almost insane, but whatever shortcomings David had, insanity was not one of them.</p>
    <p>We buried Bet, and no one wept more bitterly than Ahrian. She was David's loving comforter, and for the first time I was genuinely glad she was there.</p>

     <p>IV</p>
     <p>Star Dreams</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>On the night after the funeral I began to dream.</p>
    <p>At first the dreams were brief and vague. But they got longer and clearer, until my days became nightmares and my nights an unbearable hell. Sleep became a torture. I dreamed of space.</p>
    <p>The McQuarries are spacemen. From old Anson down the sons have flown the ships, and the daughters have married men who could fly ships, and the McQuarrie flag has been carried a long, long way. As far as I know, we never did anything more sinful than to get there first, but the McQuarrie ships have gained and held the richest cream of the trade between the worlds, and now they are breaking the trails between the stars.</p>
    <p>I was a McQuarrie, and the oldest son to boot, and I had to go to space. That was a thing as inevitable as sunrise, and as little questioned. I went.</p>
    <p>Now I dreamed of space. I was caught in it, quite alone, between the blackness and the blaze, with nothing above or below or around me but the cruel bright eyes of far-off suns to note my fall. I fell, through the millions of silent miles, turning over and over, voiceless, helpless, and when I had done falling the stars looked just the same, and it seemed I had not moved. I knew that I was going to fall forever and never be allowed to die, and at the end of forever the stars would not have changed.</p>
    <p>They were ghastly dreams. Opiates only made them worse. I spent whole days riding, until both my horse and I were weary enough to drop, so that I might sleep. It was no good. I tried drinking, and that was no help either.</p>
    <p>There was guilt in those dreams. One part of them recurred over and over—myself, knowing about the unending doom that waited for me out there beyond the sky, and running away from it, running like a hunted hare. Everywhere I turned, there was my father with his arms stretched wide, barring the way. His face was turned from me, and my fear lest he should suddenly see me and know the truth was as great in a different way as my fear of space. So I would creep away, but in the end there was no escape, and I was falling, falling down the tuneless universe.</p>
    <p>I didn't see Marthe. I didn't have the heart to see anybody. I began to think of death. It seemed preferable to a padded cell.</p>
    <p>David relented enough to be worried. Ahrian hovered over me sweetly. I didn't tell them anything, of course, except that I was having trouble sleeping.</p>
    <p>Then, curiously enough, Ahrian got mixed up in my nightmares. Not Ahrian herself, but her world, the world of Altair she had left for David.</p>
    <p>That was strange, because she had spoken very little about her world. She had, in fact, refused to talk about it. David had not discussed it either, except from the standpoint of trade. Yet here I was, seeing it in detail, in sudden bright flashes that came without reason in the midst of my horrible plunging through space. I could see every leaf and flower, each single turret of a pale and gleaming city of which I knew the streets as well as I knew my own woods. I saw in detail the quaint shapes of the roof-tops with the carving on them, and the wide plain of some feathery grass, the color of blue smoke, that sloped away toward an opalescent sea. I knew the separate colors of the several moons, and the particular perfume that came on the wind at the sinking of Altair.</p>
    <p>This was so extremely odd that I mentioned it to Ahrian, not, of course, telling her that I had had other dreams as well. She gave a little start and said, "How strange!"</p>
    <p>I went on to tell her some of the details, and suddenly she laughed and said, "But it is not so very strange, after all. I have told you all those things."</p>
    <p>"When?" I said.</p>
    <p>"Some few nights ago. You had had a number of drinks, Rafe, and perhaps you do not remember. I talked to you, thinking that it might help you to sleep, and it was of my own world that I talked."</p>
    <p>That seemed as good an explanation as any; in fact, the only one. So I let it drop, and after that I dreamed no more of Ahrian's world.</p>
    <p>I felt wretched about Marthe, but this wasn't a thing you dragged someone else into, especially someone you cared about. I put her off, and fought, not very gallantly, a fight I knew I was losing. I began to have blank periods during my waking hours. Once I found my horse on the edge of a cliff, with the dirt already sliding from under him. Another time I was looking at the sharp blade of my big pocket knife that had drawn a tentative line of red across my wrist,</p>
    <p>I stopped riding. I stopped driving my car. I locked up all my guns and made Jamieson hide the key. I knew I ought to die, but I wasn't quite ready, not quite…</p>
    <p>Marthe came one day, unannounced and uninvited. She came into the house and found me, and politely shut the door in everyone's face. Then she came and stood in front of me.</p>
    <p>"I want the truth, Rafe. What's gone wrong?"</p>
    <p>I said something about not having felt well, assured her I was all right, thanked her for coming, and tried to put her out. She wouldn't be put.</p>
    <p>"Look at me, Rafe. Is it because you don't love me?" She made me look at her, and presently she smiled and said, "I didn't think so."</p>
    <p>I caught hold of her, then. After a while she whispered, "There's something evil in this house. I felt it when I came in the door. Something wicked!"</p>
    <p>"Nonsense," I told her.</p>
    <p>She clung to it, though, and cried a little, and swore at me because I had worried her. Then she stepped back and said flatly:</p>
    <p>"You look like the devil. What is it Rafe?"</p>
    <p>"I don't quite know." Suddenly, perhaps because of what she had said, I wanted to be out of that house. Irrational? But I wasn't being rational then. "Let's take a walk. Maybe the air will clear my head."</p>
    <p>We didn't go far. The last few weeks had worn me down badly, and every crack and jar I had in my frame was plaguing me. By the time we made it to a grassy knoll well away from the house and sat down, Marthe was looking genuinely frightened.</p>
    <p>I hadn't meant to tell her anything. I had determined not to tell her. And, of course, I did tell her. I don't know what she made of it, because it wasnt very coherent, the dream part, but she got quite white and flung her arms around me.</p>
    <p>"You need a psychiatrist," she said, "and a good doctor."</p>
    <p>"I've had a doctor. And a psychiatrist isn't any good unless you're hiding something from yourself. I'm not."</p>
    <p>"But there must be some reason for the dreams."</p>
    <p>"It isn't any buried guilt. Listen, Marthe, I'll tell you something, and that will make two people in the world who know it. Maybe you won't think much of me after you hear it, but I'd have to tell you sometime and it better be now. That time my plane crashed, on the way to the spaceport. I crashed it myself. Deliberately, intentionally crashed it."</p>
    <p>Her eyes widened. Before she could say anything, I rushed on.</p>
    <p>"I never wanted to go to space. When I was a little kid, and my father would talk to me about it, I didn't want to go. I liked Earth. I liked dogs and horses and prowling in the woods. Above all, I resented being forced into a set mold that didn't fit me, just because generations of McQuarries had been poured into that mold. My father and I had some bitter words over that, when I was little.</p>
    <p>"When I got older I still felt that way, but I'd discovered it wasn't any use to fight. Besides, I liked my father. You know how some men are—pride, family tradition, all that business. Space was his life. It meant more to him to have me be a spaceman than it did to me not to be one. So I went. I didn't like it. I hated it, as a matter of fact. But I kept my mouth shut. Then, coming back from Mars on that first voyage, we lost a man.</p>
    <p>"He'd gone outside the hull to repair something, and his magnetic grapples didn't hold, and he drifted off. I saw him through the port, growing smaller and smaller as we left him behind, until he disappeared. You know how fast a spaceship moves at full acceleration? Even by the time we got the boats out it was too late. He's still there. He'll always be there.</p>
    <p>"After that, I had a horror of space, the way some people used to have for the sea. It wasn't that I was afraid of getting killed, it was the emptiness, the dark and the cold and the silence, and the waiting. I hate being cooped in, and the ship was like an iron coffin. I tried to fight it. I made two more voyages, and I was sick for months after the second one. I didn't tell anybody why. Finally I went up to the Academy to get my ticket, and my father was proud and happy. Blast people's pride and their ideas that their children have to love just what they do! He gave me a berth on his flagship.</p>
    <p>"I couldn't tell him the truth, and I couldn't go. I didn't have any right to—to ask men to depend on me and then maybe—So I crashed my plane. If I died, I wanted to do it decently and alone. If I didn't, I figured I'd get smashed up enough so that I couldn't pass a space-physical, and that would be that, with everybody's honor still intact. I guess God was on my side. Anyway, I judged the impact just right. After that, David carried the torch, and my father died happy."</p>
    <p>We didn't talk for a while. I sat turning round and round on my finger the ring that Ahrian had given me. Presently Marthe said, "That explains it"</p>
    <p>"What?"</p>
    <p>"The look I saw in your face when David's ship came in. No regret, no envy. You didn't want to be where he was. But you were as proud of him as Bet was."</p>
    <p>"He likes to strut a bit," I said, "but the son-of-a-gun is just as good as he thinks he is. Maybe better. I've talked to his men…Well, what about me?"</p>
    <p>She said some things that did me more good than any psychiatry, and for the first time in weeks I began to think perhaps there was some hope in the world. We made up a little for all the time we had lost, and then Marthe became thoughtful again.</p>
    <p>"Rafe, you started once to say something about Ahrian. Where does she come into this?"</p>
    <p>"Nowhere, really." I told her about seeming to see Ahrian's world. "Turned out she'd described it to me, and imagination did the rest."</p>
    <p>"I wonder."</p>
    <p>She sat still and intent, and then she questioned me about those particular dreams, what Ahrian had said, what I had said, what I remembered. Finally I demanded to know what she was getting at.</p>
    <p>"Has it ever occurred to you, Rafe, that all this trouble has come onto you since Ahrian came? All the tragic things there are no real explanations for—Buck, and the old mare, and Bet going down into the paddock in her white formal, a thing no woman in her right mind would do, and at that hour of the night! And now these nightmares that are driving you to—to—Oh, you didn't tell me that part of it, but I can see it in your face! It's all wrong, Rafe. It's all without reason."</p>
    <p>"But what on earth could Ahrian have to do with it? That's just wild talk, Marthe."</p>
    <p>"Is it? How do we know what the people of her world can do, what powers they may have?"</p>
    <p>"But she loves David! Why would she want to destroy his family?"</p>
    <p>"How do you know she loves him? Did she ever tell you so?"</p>
    <p>"Yes." Then Ahrian's words came back to me, and I corrected myself. "No, come to think of it. She only said love was a great force. Hang it all, though, she came with him, didn't she? All the way to Earth."</p>
    <p>For some reason, this talk was disturbing me deeply. It oppressed me, in that open empty place, and gave me a sense that someone was listening and that Marthe had better not say any more—for her own sake.</p>
    <p>"That's all nonsense," I said roughly. "People can't send dreams on each other, or make people do things, or—or kill by remote control."</p>
    <p>"People like us—no. But Ahrian isn't—people. I'm afraid of her, Rafe. She's strange, inside. Bet said the same thing."</p>
    <p>"Woman talk."</p>
    <p>"Maybe. Or maybe sometimes we're nearer the truth than men because we aren't ashamed to rely on the instincts God gave us. She's evil. She's filled the house with death."</p>
    <p>Marthe shivered as though a cold wind had struck her, and suddenly she reached out and tore Ahrian's ring off my finger and threw it far away into the deep grass.</p>
    <p>"I don't want anything of her about you. Nothing!"</p>
    <p>Then it was my turn to shiver. Because the minute that ring was gone, so were the oppression and the vague fear, and my screwed-up nerves began to slacken off again.</p>
    <p>Still I would not believe. I knew the power of suggestion, and considering the state I was in, none of my reactions would be worth a plugged nickel anyway.</p>
    <p>"I still say this is all nonsense, Marthe. Ahrian's never shown the slightest sign of having any special 'power.' She's never been anything but sweet and friendly, and she follows David around like a spaniel. And there just isn't the shadow of a motive."</p>
    <p>"I know how we can find out."</p>
    <p>I stared at her. "How?"</p>
    <p>"Those dreams you had of Ahrian's world. She couldn't have described all the details to you, and you couldn't have imagined all the rest of them exactly right. Someone who had been there would know. If the dreams were wrong, then Ahrian told the truth and they were nothing worse than dreams. But if they were right—all right—then they weren't dreams but memories from Ahrian's own mind, mixed in with the awful things she was sending to torture you."</p>
    <p>I remembered that I hadn't had a single glimpse of that world since I mentioned it to Ahrian, which seemed an odd coincidence.</p>
    <p>"Even so, how could she know how I felt about space? How could she—Oh, all right. We'll go ask David."</p>
    <p>"No, not David! Not anyone who has anything to do with her. Besides, if she has some deep reason to hate David, he wouldn't be likely to tell us, would he?"</p>
    <p>"So that's it. Don't you think maybe your reporter's mind is running away with you?"</p>
    <p>"I'm trying to save your neck, you stubborn fool!" she snarled, between rage and tears.</p>
    <p>I got up. "Come on, then. There's Griffith—he's observer on the Anson McQuarrie, and I know him fairly well." It occurred to me suddenly that Griffith hadn't been around since the night of the Anson McQuarrie's landing, and I wondered why, since he had always been a good friend of David's. For some reason, that unimportant fact made me as curious as a woman, to know why.</p>
    <p>Marthe's car was in the drive. Ahrian called to us from the terrace, looking very lovely with her filmy skirts blowing around her and her hair full of those incredible purple gleamings in the sunlight. Marthe said she was going to take me for a drive, and Ahrian said it would do me good. They both smiled, and we drove away.</p>
    <p>"Does she always wear that tiara?" asked Marthe.</p>
    <p>"I don't know. She wears it a lot. Why?"</p>
    <p>"It's extremely bad taste in the daytime."</p>
    <p>"Part of her native costume, I reckon."</p>
    <p>"She didn't have it when she came."</p>
    <p>"No, she made it—Oh, who cares!"</p>
    <p>I yawned and went to sleep. I slept like a baby and never dreamed of anything. I was still asleep when Marthe stopped at the address in the city I had given her and only woke when she shook me half out of the car.</p>

     <p>About Altair</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Griffith was home. Spacemen are usually home between voyages, with their shoes off and their feet up, getting acquainted with their wives and kids. He seemed glad to see me, but not too glad. He asked how everything was, and I said, "Fine," and he said he'd been meaning to come up but he'd been too busy, and we both knew that neither statement was true. Then he said awkwardly that he was sorry about Bet, and I thanked him. When he couldn't think of any more ways to stall, he asked me what-he could do for me.</p>
    <p>"Well," I said, "my fiancée is wild to see the pictures you shot on the last voyage. New worlds, and all that." I explained to him who she was. "She's thinking of doing an article—how a special observer works, how the records are turned over to the government and the scientific bodies, and so on. I thought, as a special favor, you might be willing to show her the reels."</p>
    <p>"Oh," he said, almost with a sigh of relief. "Sure, I'll be glad to."</p>
    <p>He took us off to a small building at the rear of the house, where he had his photo lab and a projection room. He found the reels he wanted while chattering about some fine astronomical stuff that he'd been given an award for. Marthe asked him all the questions she could think of about his work, taking notes in a business-like way. The projector began to hum. We watched.</p>
    <p>The reels were magnificent. Griffith knew his job. Interstellar space came alive before us. Nebulae, clusters, unknown Suns, glittering star streams, swept across the tridimensional screen in perfect reproduction of color.</p>
    <p>We watched strange solar systems plunge toward us, and then the slow unveiling of individual planets as the Anson McQuarrie sank toward them. Some were dead and barren, some furiously alive, and some were peopled, not always by anything approaching the human. Each had its spectrum analysis and an exhaustive list of what ores and minerals might be found there, also atmosphere content, gravity, types and aspects of native flora and fauna.</p>
    <p>In the fascination of watching, I almost forgot what I came for. Then—</p>
    <p>It was there. The world, the country of my dream—Ahrian's world. Each leaf and flower and blade of grass, each shading of color, the gleaming city with the curious roofs, the plain that swept toward the opalescent sea.</p>
    <p>I felt very sick and strange. I'm not sure what happened after that, but presently I was back in Griffith's house and Marthe was feeding me brandy. I asked for more, and when I stopped shaking I turned to Griffith, who was much upset.</p>
    <p>"That was the second world of Altair," I said. "The home world of my brother's wife."</p>
    <p>"Yes," said Griffith.</p>
    <p>"What happened there?" I got up and went close to him, and he stepped back a little. "What happened between my brother and Ahrian?"</p>
    <p>"You better ask David," he muttered and tried to turn away. I caught him.</p>
    <p>"Tell me," I said. "Bet's already dead, so it's too late for her. But there's David—and me. For God's sake, Griff, you used to be his friend!"</p>
    <p>"Yes," said Griffith slowly, "I used to be. I told him not to do what he did, but you know David." He made an angry, indecisive gesture, and then he looked at me. "She's such a little thing. How did she—I mean—"</p>
    <p>"Never mind. Just tell me what David did to her. She didn't come with him of her own free will, did she?"</p>
    <p>"No. Oh, he tried to make out that she did, but everybody knew better. To this day I don't know exactly what the deal was, but her people needed something, a particular chemical or drug, I think, and they must have needed it badly. The ship, of course, was heavily stocked with all sorts of chemicals and medical supplies—you know how useful David has found them before in establishing good relations with other races.</p>
    <p>"If it isn't their kids, it's their cattle, or a crop blight, or polluted water, and they're always grateful when you can fix things up, especially the primitives. Well, Ahrian's people are far from primitive, but I guess they'd run out of the source for whatever it was. David was mighty secretive about the whole thing."</p>
    <p>He hesitated, and I prodded him. "What you're trying to say is that David gave them the chemicals or drugs they needed in exchange for Ahrian. Bought her, in fact."</p>
    <p>Griffith nodded. He seemed to feel a personal sense of shame about it, as though the act of service under David had made him a party to the crime.</p>
    <p>"Blackmailed her would be closer to the truth," he said. "The ugliest part of it was that Ahrian was already pledged…At least, that's what I heard. Anyway, no, she didn't come of her own free will."</p>
    <p>I think, if I had had David's neck between my hands then, I would have broken it. How evil a mess could a man make? And where were you going to put justice?</p>
    <p>Marthe said to Griffith, "Did her people have any unusual abilities? It's very important, Mr. Griffith."</p>
    <p>"Their culture is very complex, and we weren't there long enough to study it in detail. Also, there was the language barrier. But I'm pretty sure they're telepaths—many races are, you know—though to what extent I couldn't say."</p>
    <p>"Telepaths," said Marthe softly, and looked at me. "Mr. Griffith, do the women there wear a sort of tiara, shaped like—" She described Ahrian's headgear minutely, including the oddly cut crystal. "Habitually, I mean."</p>
    <p>He stared at her as though he thought it was just like a woman to worry about fashions at a time like this. "Honestly, Miss Walters, I didn't notice. Both sexes go in for jewelry, and nearly all of them make it themselves, and nobody could keep track—" He halted, apparently struck by a sudden memory. "I did see a marriage ceremony, though, where little crowns like that were used as we use rings. The man and woman exchanged them, and as near as I could figure the words the rite was called something like the One-Making."</p>
    <p>"Thank you," said Marthe. "Thank you very much. Now I think I'd better get Rafe home."</p>
    <p>I said something to Griffith, I'm not sure what, but he shook hands with me and seemed relieved. I sat in the car, thinking, and Marthe drove, not back toward the house, but to her apartment. She told me she'd be back in a minute and went off, taking the keys with her. I sat thinking, and my thoughts were not good. Marthe returned, carrying a small suitcase.</p>
    <p>"What's that for?" I demanded.</p>
    <p>"I'm staying with you."</p>
    <p>"The devil you are!"</p>
    <p>She faced me, with a look as level as a steel blade and just as unyielding. "You mean more to me than propriety, or my good name, or even my own skin. Is that clear? I am staying with you until this business is finished."</p>
    <p>I roared at her. I pleaded with her. I explained that if Ahrian were out for me, she would be out for Marthe too, if she got in the way. I told her she'd only make it harder for me, worrying about her.</p>
    <p>All the time I was roaring, pleading, and explaining, Marthe was driving out of town, immovable, maddening, and wonderful. Finally I gave up. I couldn't throw her out of the car. Even if I had, it wouldn't have prevented her coming.</p>
    <p>She spoke at last. "Of course, you know there's a simple solution to all this—simple, logical, and safe."</p>
    <p>"What?"</p>
    <p>"Go away out of Ahrian's reach, and let David take his own consequences."</p>
    <p>"He deserves it," I said savagely.</p>
    <p>"But you won't go away."</p>
    <p>"How can I, Marthe?" And I began to yell at her all over again because she wouldn't go.</p>
    <p>"All right, that's settled. Now let's start thinking. Obviously, we can't go to the police."</p>
    <p>"Hardly." It was frightening to consider what a hard-boiled cop would make out of a woman who had lavender hair and performed witchcraft. "You believe that tiara Ahrian wears has something to do with her—well, her power over other people's minds?"</p>
    <p>"Possibly. I don't know. That's just it, Rafe—we don't know, and so we have to be suspicious of everything."</p>
    <p>I remembered the unexplainable sensation I had had when Marthe threw that ring away. Could it have been a contact, a sort of focal point to concentrate the energy of her thought-waves which were, perhaps, amplified and controlled by the aid of that mesh of gold and platinum wires and that strangely faceted crystal? I remembered also the necklace of zircons that glittered on Bet's throat, the night she died.</p>
    <p>These gifts must be fashioned with a meaning from the heart…</p>
    <p>"I don't know what we're going to do, Rafe. Do you?"</p>
    <p>"Face them with it, I suppose. Face them both. Drag it out in the open, anyway."</p>
    <p>Marthe sighed, and we drove on in gloomy silence.</p>

    <p>It was dark when we reached the house. Ahrian welcomed us with little cries of delight.</p>
    <p>"I am so happy you have brought Marthe back with you. It has been too long since we have seen her."</p>
    <p>"She's staying for a while," I said.</p>
    <p>"How very nice. Since the little one is gone, I am lonely with no woman to talk to. Come, I will see that all is well in the room of guests."</p>
    <p>"Where's David?" I asked.</p>
    <p>"Oh, he has gone into the city and will not be back tonight. And my heart is sad, for I think that he has gone to talk of another voyage."</p>
    <p>She took Marthe away. I followed, on the pretext of making sure that Marthe had everything she needed, and stayed until the arrival of the maid. Then I went and changed for dinner, cursing David.</p>
    <p>I got a word alone with Marthe before we went down. "We'd better wait," I said. "I want to tackle them together. It's the only way I know to put David on his guard."</p>
    <p>"Has he mentioned another voyage to you?" Marthe wanted to know.</p>
    <p>I shook my head. "But then, he seldom mentions anything to me any more."</p>
    <p>"Ahrian's doing."</p>
    <p>There didn't seem to be any doubt about that. David and I had never exactly loved one another, but there had certainly never been any real ill feeling between us, either. Since Bet's death, all that had been changed.</p>
    <p>Ahrian put herself out to be nice to Marthe. If we hadn't known what we knew, it would have been a delightful evening. Instead, it was rather horrible. All the time I was remembering how I had felt out there on the hill and wondering how much Ahrian knew, or suspected, and what she might be going to do about it.</p>
    <p>All at once she cried out, "Oh Rafe, you have lost your ring!"</p>
    <p>I told her some reasonably plausible lie. "I'm awfully sorry, Ahrian. You must make me another some time."</p>
    <p>She smiled. "There will be no need for that. Wait." She ran off. Marthe and I looked at each other, not daring to speak. Presently Ahrian came back, presumably from her work room, carrying a cushion made of silk.</p>
    <p>"See? I have made these for you both—a betrothal gift."</p>
    <p>On the cushion were two rings, identical in design, one large, one small. The zircons made a pale glittering, like two wicked eyes that watched us.</p>
    <p>"Will you not exchange them now? I should be so happy!"</p>
    <p>Marthe was going to say something violent. I gave her a look that shut her up and thanked Ahrian profusely. It was one of those things. If she knew we suspected her and her gifts, that was that. But if she didn't know, I didn't want her to find out just yet.</p>
    <p>"But," I said, "they are too beautiful for mere gifts. We'll save them for the wedding, Ahrian. We were planning on a double ring ceremony anyway, and these will be perfect. Won't they, Marthe?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, yes," she said.</p>
    <p>Ahrian beamed like a happy child, and murmured that her little trinkets weren't worthy of such an honor, and in that moment I began to doubt the whole crazy story again. No one could look so guileless and innocent and sweet as Ahrian did, and be guilty of the things we thought she was.</p>
    <p>Marthe must have seen me wavering, because she said, "Rafe, darling, put them away where they'll be quite safe. I wouldn't want anything to happen to them before the wedding."</p>
    <p>I took them up to my room and hid them in the farthest back corner of a bureau drawer under a pile of shirts. While I was up there alone, the most awful temptation came over me to put the big one on my finger—just to look at it, to admire the sparkle of the queerly cut stone and the wonderful filigree work of the band. What harm could there be in a ring?</p>
    <p>I guess it was the very strength of that compulsion that saved me. I got scared. I slammed the drawer shut, locked it, and threw the key out the window. Then I turned around to find Marthe standing in the doorway.</p>
    <p>"I wouldn't have let you put it on," she whispered. "But you see, Rafe? You see how right we were!"</p>
    <p>I began to shake a bit. We started downstairs again, and Marthe said in my ear, "She knows. I'm sure she knows.''</p>
    <p>I agreed with her, and I was afraid. It shamed me to be afraid of such a frail little creature, but I was.</p>
    <p>Marthe and I were both relieved when it came time to go to bed. It freed us from the weird necessity of making conversation with Ahrian. I had no intention of sleeping, but it was good to be away from her. Marthe's room was down the hall from mine, farther than I liked but plenty close enough to hear her if she called me.</p>
    <p>I told her to leave the door open and yell like the devil if anything—anything at all—seemed wrong to her. I left mine open, too, and sat down in a chair where I could see the lighted hall. I wished I had a gun, but I didn't dare leave Marthe for all the time it would take to rouse out Jamieson and get the key. I picked out the heaviest stick I had and kept it in my hand.</p>
    <p>The house was quiet, and nothing happened. The huge relic of a clock that stood on the stair landing chimed peacefully every fifteen minutes, and every hour it counted off the strokes in a deep, soft voice. I think the last time I heard it was half-past two. I didn't mean to sleep. I had purposely drunk nothing but black coffee all evening. But I had been so long without sleep!</p>
    <p>I remember getting up and walking down the hall to Marthe's door and glancing in at her, curled up in the big bed. After that things got dim. I don't believe that I slept very deeply, or very long, but it was enough. I dreamed with a terrible vividness of Marthe. She was standing in the garden, wrapped in a plaid bathrobe, and she was in danger, very great danger, and she needed me.</p>
    <p>Starting up out of the chair, I listened for a moment. The house was silent, except for the clock ticking gently to itself on the landing. I ran down the hall and into Marthe's room. At first I thought she was still there, and then I saw that the shape in the bed was only a jinockery of tumbled blankets. I called her. There was no answer. Calling, I ran down through the house, and there was no answer at all until I came out on the terrace above the shadowy garden. Then I heard her say my name.</p>
    <p>She was standing in a patch of moonlight with the plaid robe wrapped around her, and her face was white as death. In a minute I had my arms around her and she was sobbing, asking if I were safe.</p>
    <p>"I must have been dreaming, Rafe, but I thought you were somewhere out here, hurt, maybe dying."</p>
    <p>She was in a terrible fright, and so was I. Because I knew who had sent those dreams—easy dreams to send, without any aids to telepathy, since with each of us the thought of danger to the other was right on top of our minds, conscious and screaming.</p>
    <p>I wanted out of that garden.</p>
    <p>We went up the steps together and onto the wide terrace, in that clear, white, damnable moonlight. From the long doors that opened into the library David stepped and barred our way. He held a heavy double-barreled shotgun, and at that range he couldn't miss.</p>
    <p>David.</p>
    <p>He hadn't gone to town. He had been in his room all this time—waiting. His eyes were wide open, empty and bright, reflecting the cold fire of the moon.</p>
    <p>Ahrian was with him.</p>
    <p>I made some futile gesture of getting Marthe behind me, and I cried out, "David!" He turned his head a very little, like a man who hears a sound far off, and his brow puckered, but he did not speak.</p>
    <p>Ahrian said softly, "I am sorry that it must be so, Rafe and Marthe. You are blameless, and you have been kind. If only Marthe had not sensed what was within me…But now it must be finished here, tonight"</p>
    <p>"Ahrian," I said, and the twin black barrels of the shotgun watched me, and the stone of David's ring sparkled against the stock. "David did a wicked thing. We know about it—but does it give you the right to kill us all? Bet, and Marthe…"</p>
    <p>"I made a promise to my gods," she whispered. "I had a mother and father, a brother, a sister—and more than all of them, though I loved them dearly, there was one who would have been my other self."</p>
    <p>"I'll take you back," I said. "I'll send a ship out to Altair—only let Marthe go!"</p>
    <p>"Could I go back as I am, as he has made me? Could I find my life again, with the blood that is already on me? No. I will take from David everything that he loves, even space itself, and in the end I will tell him how and why. Then—I will die."</p>
    <p>"All right. All right, Ahrian. But why Marthe? She can't stop you. If David kills me, that's enough. He'll be tried for murder, the whole story will come out, and that will be the end of him whether he's convicted or not."</p>
    <p>Ahrian smiled, a tender thing of ineffable sadness. "Marthe is speaking within herself, words that you should hear. Her body wishes much to live, but her heart says, 'Not without him,' and her heart is stronger. No, Rafe. If she lives, she will slip David out of the cage I have built for him. Now let us stop torturing each other!"</p>
    <p>Her face contracted in a spasm of pain. She turned her head toward the motionless effigy of a man who stood beside her, and I saw the gun go up, and I knew this was the finish.</p>
    <p>I shouted his name once more, pure reflex, and shoved Marthe aside as far as I could. David was twenty-five or thirty feet away. I bent over and began to run toward him. I didn't know why. It was hopeless, but it was all I could think of to do. The distance looked like thirty miles—and then I heard him moan. He was moaning the way old Buck had moaned that day, and his head was pulled back as though he were straining away from something. I knew he didn't want to kill me, even then.</p>
    <p>Ahrian whispered. The crystal glowed in the moonlight, and there was in her face a magnificent and awful strength. David gave a low wail of agony. The cords stood out on the backs of his hands. The eyes of the woman from Altair blazed like purple stars. The gunstock settled into place, and David's finger curled in on the trigger.</p>
    <p>Someone sped by me, off to one side and going like the wind. Someone in a plaid robe, headed not for David, but for Ahrian.</p>
    <p>There was a scream, I don't know whose. Maybe mine. The gun let off, both barrels, right above my shoulder, and the hot metal seared my hand where I shoved the thing up at the last second so that it hit nothing but the tree tops. David groaned and let it drop, and so did I. I reeled around, and there was Marthe leaning over the stone balustrade, shivering, sobbing, triumphant, holding in one hand the crystal tiara.</p>
    <p>I carried Ahrian into the house. Her body, light and frail as a bird's, was broken. It was a long fall into the garden, and she had hit hard. Her hair had come loose and hung over my arm in a long thick pall, dark purple in the moonlight.</p>
    <p>I laid her on the couch, as gently as I could. She looked up at me and said quite clearly, "The beasts I could force against their will. The human mind is stronger. With all my skill and care—a little too strong."</p>
    <p>She was still a while, and then she whispered, "I am sad, Rafe, that I must die so far away from home."</p>
    <p>That was all.</p>
    <p>The shot had roused the servants, who began to straggle in from the far wing of the house. I told them that David thought he had heard prowlers and fired at them, and in the excitement Ahrian had fallen from the terrace. They believed it. Why not? David was still sitting out there, doubled up on the cold stone, looking at nothing. Somehow I couldn't speak to him, or touch him. I sent the servants to get him in, and told them to call the people who had to be called. Then I took Marthe up to her room.</p>
    <p>"It'll be all right," I told her. "It was an accident. Let me tell the story. You won't even be named."</p>
    <p>"I don't care," she said, in a strange harsh voice. "All I care about is you, and you're alive and safe." She put her arms around me, a fierce and painful grip. "I'm sorry I killed her, I didn't mean to, but I'd do it again, Rafe, I'd do it again—she wanted to kill you!" She caught her breath, still clinging to me, and then she began to cry. "You fool, oh you fool, rushing David like that to make him fire at you instead of me." She said some more things, and then her voice got faint. I put her on the bed and made her take a sedative, and presently she was asleep.</p>
    <p>I left the maid with her, and went downstairs. There were things I had to say to David.</p>
    <p>That was how the McQuarrie tradition came to an end after two hundred years. Even the house is gone, for none of us could bear it any longer. David will never go to space again.</p>
    <p>I'm glad. What did it gain the McQuarries? What has it ever gained men? Have men ever brought back more happiness from the stars? Will they ever?</p>
    <p>Well, it's too late now to wonder about that. It's been too late, ever since the first skin-clad barbarian stared up at the moon and lusted for it. If Marthe and I have sons, I am afraid that McQuarries will go to space again.</p>

    <p>He came alone into the wineshop, wrapped in a dark red cloak, with the cowl drawn over his head. He stood for a moment by the doorway and one of the slim dark predatory women who live in those places went to him, with a silvery chiming from the little bells that were almost all she wore.</p>
    <p>I saw her smile up at him. And then, suddenly, the smile became fixed and something happened to her eyes. She was no longer looking at the cloaked man but through him. In the oddest fashion—it was as though he had become invisible.</p>
    <p>She went by him. Whether she passed some word along or not I couldn't tell but an empty space widened around the stranger. And no one looked at him. They did not avoid looking at him. They simply refused to see him.</p>
    <p>He began to walk slowly across the crowded room. He was very tall and he moved with a fluid, powerful grace that was beautiful to watch. People drifted out of his way, not seeming to, but doing it. The air was thick with nameless smells, shrill with the laughter of women.</p>
    <p>Two tall barbarians, far gone in wine, were carrying on some intertribal feud and the yelling crowd had made room for them to fight. There was a silver pipe and a drum and a double-banked harp making old wild music. Lithe brown bodies leaped and whirled through the laughter and the shouting and the smoke.</p>
    <p>The stranger walked through all this, alone, untouched, unseen. He passed close to where I sat. Perhaps because I, of all the people in that place, not only saw him but stared at him, he gave me a glance of black eyes from under the shadow of his cowl—eyes like blown coals, bright with suffering and rage.</p>
    <p>I caught only a glimpse of his muffled face. The merest glimpse, but that was enough. Why did he have to show his face to me in that wineshop in Barrakesh?</p>
    <p>He passed on. There was no space in the shadowy corner where he went but space was made, a circle of it, a moat between the stranger and the crowd. He sat down. I saw him lay a coin on the outer edge of the table. Presently a serving wench came up, picked up the coin and set down a cup of wine. But it was as if she waited on an empty table.</p>
    <p>I turned to Kardak, my head drover, a Shunni with massive shoulders and uncut hair braided in an intricate tribal knot. "What's all that about?" I asked.</p>
    <p>Kardak shrugged. "Who knows?" He started to rise. "Come, JonRoss. It is time we got back to the serai."</p>
    <p>"We're not leaving for hours yet. And don't lie to me, I've been on Mars a long time. What is that man? Where does he come from?"</p>
    <p>Barrakesh is the gateway between north and south. Long ago, when there were oceans in equatorial and southern Mars, when Valkis and Jekkara were proud seats of empire and not thieves' dens, here on the edge of the northern Drylands the great caravans had come and gone to Barrakesh for a thousand thousand years. It is a place of strangers.</p>
    <p>In the time-eaten streets of rock you see tall Keshi hillmen, nomads from the high plains of Upper Shun, lean dark men from the south who barter away the loot of forgotten tombs and temples, cosmopolitan sophisticates up from Kahora and the trade cities, where there are spaceports and all the appurtenances of modern civilization.</p>
    <p>The red-cloaked stranger was none of these.</p>
    <p>A glimpse of a face— I am a planetary anthropologist. I was supposed to be charting Martian ethnology and I was doing it on a fellowship grant I had wangled from a Terran university too ignorant to know that the vastness of Martian history makes such a project hopeless.</p>
    <p>I was in Barrakesh, gathering an outfit preparatory to a year's study of the tribes of Upper Shun. And suddenly there had passed close by me a man with golden skin and un-Martian black eyes and a facial structure that belonged to no race I knew. I have seen the carven faces of fauns that were a little like it.</p>
    <p>Kardak said again, "It is time to go, JonRoss!"</p>
    <p>I looked at the stranger, drinking his wine in silence and alone. "Very well, I'll ask him."</p>
    <p>Kardak sighed. "Earthmen," he said, "are not given much to wisdom." He turned and left me.</p>
    <p>I crossed the room and stood beside the stranger. In the old courteous High Martian they speak in all the Low-Canal towns I asked permission to sit.</p>
    <p>Those raging, suffering eyes met mine. There was hatred in them, and scorn, and shame. "What breed of human are you?"</p>
    <p>"I am an Earthman."</p>
    <p>He said the name over as though he had heard it before and was trying to remember. "Earthman. Then it is as the winds have said, blowing across the desert—that Mars is dead and men from other worlds defile her dust." He looked out over the wineshop and all the people who would not admit his presence. "Change," he whispered. "Death and change and the passing away of things."</p>
    <p>The muscles of his face drew tight. He drank and I could see now that he had been drinking for a long time, for days, perhaps for weeks. There was a quiet madness on him.</p>
    <p>"Why do the people shun you?"</p>
    <p>"Only a man of Earth would need to ask," he said and made a sound of laughter, very dry and bitter.</p>
    <p>I was thinking, A new race, an unknown race! I was thinking of the fame that sometimes comes to men who discover a new thing, and of a Chair I might sit in at the University if I added one bright unheard-of piece of the shadowy mosaic of Martian history. I had had my share of wine and a bit more. That Chair looked a mile high and made of gold.</p>
    <p>The stranger said softly, "I go from place to place in this wallow of Barrakesh and everywhere it is the same. I have ceased to be." His white teeth glittered for an instant in the shadow of the cowl. "They were wiser than I, my people. When Shandakor is dead, we are dead also, whether our bodies live or not."</p>
    <p>"Shandakor?" I said. It had a sound of distant bells.</p>
    <p>"How should an Earthman know? Yes, Shandakor! Ask of the men of Kesh and the men of Shun! Ask the kings of Mekh, who are half around the world! Ask of all the men of Mars—they have not forgotten Shandakor! But they will not tell you. It is a bitter shame to them, the memory and the name."</p>
    <p>He stared out across the turbulent throng that filled the room and flowed over to the noisy street outside. "And I am here among them—lost."</p>
    <p>"Shandakor is dead?"</p>
    <p>"Dying. There were three of us who did not want to die. We came south across the desert—one turned back, one perished in the sand, I am here in Barrakesh." The metal of the wine-cup bent between his hands.</p>
    <p>I said, "And you regret your coming."</p>
    <p>"I should have stayed and died with Shandakor. I know that now. But I cannot go back."</p>
    <p>"Why not?" I was thinking how the name John Ross would look, inscribed in golden letters on the scroll of the discoverers.</p>
    <p>"The desert is wide, Earthman. Too wide for one alone."</p>
    <p>And I said, "I have a caravan. I am going north tonight."</p>
    <p>A light came into his eyes, so strange and deadly that I was afraid. "No," he whispered. "No!"</p>
    <p>I sat in silence, looking out across the crowd that had forgotten me as well, because I sat with the stranger. A new race, an unknown city. And I was drunk.</p>
    <p>After a long while the stranger asked me, "What does an Earthman want in Shandakor?"</p>
    <p>I told him. He laughed. "You study men," he said and laughed again, so that the red cloak rippled.</p>
    <p>"If you want to go back I'll take you. If you don't, tell me where the city lies and I'll find it. Your race, your city, should have their place in history."</p>
    <p>He said nothing but the wine had made me very shrewd and I could guess at what was going on in the stranger's mind. I got up.</p>
    <p>"Consider it," I told him. "You can find me at the serai by the northern gate until the lesser moon is up. Then I'll be gone."</p>
    <p>"Wait." His fingers fastened on my wrist. They hurt. I looked into his face and I did not like what I saw there. But, as Kardak had mentioned, I was not given much to wisdom.</p>
    <p>The stranger said, "Your men will not go beyond the Wells of Karthedon."</p>
    <p>"Then we'll go without them."</p>
    <p>A long long silence. Then he said, "So be it."</p>
    <p>I knew what he was thinking as plainly as though he had spoken the words. He was thinking that I was only an Earthman and that he would kill me when we came in sight of Shandakor.</p>

     <p>II</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>The caravan tracks branch off at the Wells of Karthedon. One goes westward into Shun and one goes north through the passes of Outer Kesh. But there is a third one, more ancient than the others. It goes toward the east and it is never used. The deep rock wells are dry and the stone-built shelters have vanished under the rolling dunes. It is not until the track begins to climb the mountains that there are even memories.</p>
    <p>Kardak refused politely to go beyond the Wells. He would wait for me, he said, a certain length of time, and if I came back we would go on into Shun. If I didn't—well, his full pay was left in charge of the local headman. He would collect it and go home. He had not liked having the stranger with us. He had doubled his price.</p>
    <p>In all that long march up from Barrakesh I had not been able to get a word out of Kardak or the men concerning Shandakor. The stranger had not spoken either. He had told me his name—Corin—and nothing more. Cloaked and cowled he rode alone and brooded. His private devils were still with him and he had a new one now—impatience. He would have ridden us all to death if I had let him.</p>
    <p>So Corin and I went east alone from Karthedon, with two led animals and all the water we could carry. And now I could not hold him back.</p>
    <p>"There is no time to stop," he said. "The days are running out. There is no time!"</p>
    <p>When we reached the mountains we had only three animals left and when we crossed the first ridge we were afoot and leading the one remaining beast which carried the dwindling water skins.</p>
    <p>We were following a road now. Partly hewn and partly worn it led up and over the mountains, those naked leaning mountains that were full of silence and peopled only with the shapes of red rock that the wind had carved.</p>
    <p>"Armies used to come this way," said Corin. "Kings and caravans and beggars and human slaves, singers and dancing girls and the embassies of princes. This was the road to Shandakor."</p>
    <p>And we went along it at a madman's pace.</p>
    <p>The beast fell in a slide of rock and broke its neck and we carried the last water skin between us. It was not a heavy burden. It grew lighter and then was almost gone.</p>
    <p>One afternoon, long before sunset, Corin said abruptly, "We will stop here."</p>
    <p>The road went steeply up before us. There was nothing to be seen or heard. Corin sat down in the drifted dust. I crouched down too, a little distance from him. I watched him. His face was hidden and he did not speak.</p>
    <p>The shadows thickened in that deep and narrow way. Overhead the strip of sky flared saffron and then red—and then the bright cruel stars came out. The wind worked at its cutting and polishing of stone, muttering to itself, an old and senile wind full of dissatisfaction and complaint. There was the dry faint click of falling pebbles.</p>
    <p>The gun felt cold in my hand, covered with my cloak. I did not want to use it. But I did not want to die here on this silent pathway of vanished armies and caravans and kings.</p>
    <p>A shaft of greenish moonlight crept down between the walls. Corin stood up.</p>
    <p>"Twice now I have followed lies. Here I am met at last by truth."</p>
    <p>I said, "I don't understand you."</p>
    <p>"I thought I could escape the destruction. That was a lie. Then I thought I could return to share it. That too was a lie. Now I see the truth. Shandakor is dying. I fled from that dying, which is the end of the city and the end of my race. The shame of flight is on me and I can never go back."</p>
    <p>"What will you do?"</p>
    <p>"I will die here."</p>
    <p>"And I?"</p>
    <p>"Did you think," asked Corin softly, "that I would bring an alien creature in to watch the end of Shandakor?"</p>
    <p>I moved first. I didn't know what weapons he might have, hidden under that dark red cloak. I threw myself over on the dusty rock. Something went past my head with a hiss and a rattle and a flame of light and then I cut the legs from under him and he fell down forward and I got on top of him, very fast.</p>
    <p>He had vitality. I had to hit his head twice against the rock before I could take out of his hands the vicious little instrument of metal rods. I threw it far away. I could not feel any other weapons on him except a knife and I took that, too. Then I got up.</p>
    <p>I said, "I will carry you to Shandakor."</p>
    <p>He lay still, draped in the tumbled folds of his cloak. His breath made a harsh sighing in his throat. "So be it." And then he asked for water.</p>
    <p>I went to where the skin lay and picked it up, thinking that there was perhaps a cupful left. I didn't hear him move. What he did was done very silently with a sharp-edged ornament. I brought him the water and it was already over. I tried to lift him up. His eyes looked at me with a curiously brilliant look. Then he whispered three words, in a language I didn't know, and died. I let him down again.</p>
    <p>His blood had poured out across the dust. And even in the moonlight I could see that it was not the color of human blood.</p>
    <p>I crouched there for a long while, overcome with a strange sickness. Then I reached out and pushed that red cowl back to bare his head. It was a beautiful head. I had never seen it. If I had, I would not have gone alone with Corin into the mountains. I would have understood many things if I had seen it and not for fame nor money would I have gone to Shandakor.</p>
    <p>His skull was narrow and arched and the shaping of the bones was very fine. On that skull was a covering of short curling fibers that had an almost metallic luster in the moonlight, silvery and bright. They stirred under my hand, soft silken wires responding of themselves to an alien touch. And even as I took my hand away the luster faded from them and the texture changed.</p>
    <p>When I touched them again they did not stir. Corin's ears were pointed and there were silvery tufts on the tips of them. On them and on his forearms and his breast were the faint, faint memories of scales, a powdering of shining dust across the golden skin. I looked at his teeth and they were not human either.</p>
    <p>I knew now why Corin had laughed when I told him that I studied men.</p>
    <p>It was very still. I could hear the falling of pebbles and the little stones that rolled all lonely down the cliffs and the shift and whisper of dust in the settling cracks. The Wells of Karthedon were far away. Too far by several lifetimes for one man on foot with a cup of water.</p>
    <p>I looked at the road that went steep and narrow on ahead. I looked at Corin. The wind was cold and the shaft of moonlight was growing thin. I did not want to stay alone in the dark with Corin.</p>
    <p>I rose and went on along the road that led to Shandakor.</p>
    <p>It was a long climb but not a long way. The road came out between two pinnacles of rock. Below that gateway, far below in the light of the little low moons that pass so swiftly over Mars, there was a mountain valley.</p>
    <p>Once around that valley there were great peaks crowned with snow and crags of black and crimson where the flying lizards nested, the hawk-lizards with the red eyes. Below the crags there were forests, purple and green and gold, and a black tarn deep on the valley floor. But when I saw it it was dead. The peaks had fallen away and the forests were gone and the tarn was only a pit in the naked rock.</p>
    <p>In the midst of that desolation stood a fortress city.</p>
    <p>There were lights in it, soft lights of many colors. The outer walls stood up, black and massive, a barrier against the creeping dust, and within them was an island of life. The high towers were not ruined. The lights burned among them and there was movement in the streets.</p>
    <p>A living city—and Corin had said that Shandakor was almost dead.</p>
    <p>A rich and living city. I did not understand. But I knew one thing. Those who moved along the distant streets of Shandakor were not human.</p>
    <p>I stood shivering in that windy pass. The bright towers of the city beckoned and there was something unnatural about all light-life in the deathly valley. And then I thought that human or not the people of Shandakor might sell me water and a beast to carry it and I could get away out of these mountains, back to the Wells.</p>
    <p>The road broadened, winding down the slope. I walked in the middle of it, not expecting anything. And suddenly two men came out of nowhere and barred the way.</p>
    <p>I yelled. I jumped backward with my heart pounding and the sweat pouring off me. I saw their broadswords glitter in the moonlight. And they laughed.</p>
    <p>They were human. One was a tall red barbarian from Mekh, which lay to the east half around Mars. The other was a leaner browner man from Taarak, which was farther still. I was scared and angry and astonished and I asked a foolish question.</p>
    <p>"What are you doing here?"</p>
    <p>"We wait," said the man of Taarak. He made a circle with his arm to take in all the darkling slopes around the valley. "From Kesh and Shun, from all the countries of the Norlands and the Marches men have come, to wait. And you?"</p>
    <p>"I'm lost," I said. "I'm an Earthman and I have no quarrel with anyone." I was still shaking but now it was with relief. I would not have to go to Shandakor. If there was a barbarian army gathered here it must have supplies and I could deal with them.</p>
    <p>I told them what I needed. "I can pay for them, pay well."</p>
    <p>They looked at each other.</p>
    <p>"Very well. Come and you can bargain with the chief."</p>
    <p>They fell in on either side of me. We walked three paces and then I was on my face in the dirt and they were all over me like two great wildcats. When they were finished they had everything I owned except the few articles of clothing for which they had no use. I got up again, wiping the blood from my mouth.</p>
    <p>"For an outlander," said the man of Mekh, "you fight well." He chinked my money-bag up and down in his palm, feeling the weight of it, and then he handed me the leather bottle that hung at his side. "Drink," he told me. "That much I can't deny you. But our water must be carried a long way across these mountains and we have none to waste on Earthmen."</p>
    <p>I was not proud. I emptied his bottle for him. And the man of Taarak said, smiling, "Go on to Shandakor. Perhaps they will give you water."</p>
    <p>"But you've taken all my money!"</p>
    <p>"They are rich in Shandakor. They don't need money. Go ask them for water."</p>
    <p>They stood there, laughing at some secret joke of their own, and I did not like the sound of it. I could have killed them both and danced on their bodies but they had left me nothing but my bare hands to fight with. So presently I turned and went on and left them grinning in the dark behind me.</p>
    <p>The road led down and out across the plain. I could feel eyes watching me, the eyes of the sentinels on the rounding slopes, piercing the dim moonlight. The walls of the city began to rise higher and higher. They hid everything but the top of one tall tower that had a queer squat globe on top of it. Rods of crystal projected from the globe. It revolved slowly and the rods sparkled with a sort of white fire that was just on the edge of seeing.</p>
    <p>A causeway lifted toward the Western Gate. I mounted it, going very slowly, not wanting to go at all. And now I could see that the gate was open. Open—and this was a city under siege!</p>
    <p>I stood still for some time, trying to puzzle out what meaning this might have—an army that did not attack and a city with open gates. I could not find a meaning. There were soldiers on the walls but they were lounging at their ease under the bright banners. Beyond the gate many people moved about but they were intent on their own affairs. I could not hear their voices.</p>
    <p>I crept closer, closer still. Nothing happened. The sentries did not challenge me and no one spoke.</p>
    <p>You know how necessity can force a man against his judgment and against his will?</p>
    <p>I entered Shandakor.</p>

     <p>III</p>
    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>There was an open space beyond the gate, a square large enough to hold an army. Around its edges were the stalls of merchants. Their canopies were of rich woven stuffs and the wares they sold were such things as have not been seen on Mars for more centuries than men can remember.</p>
    <p>There were fruits and rare furs, the long-lost dyes that never fade, furnishings carved from vanished woods. There were spices and wines and exquisite cloths. In one place a merchant from the far south offered a ceremonial rug woven from the long bright hair of virgins. And it was new.</p>
    <p>These merchants were all human. The nationalities of some of them I knew. Others I could guess at from traditional accounts. Some were utterly unknown.</p>
    <p>Of the throngs that moved about among the stalls, quite a number were human also. There were merchant princes come to barter and there were companies of slaves on their way to the auction block. But the others . . .</p>
    <p>I stayed where I was, pressed into a shadowy corner by the gate, and the chill that was on me was not all from the night wind.</p>
    <p>The golden-skinned silver-crested lords of Shandakor I knew well enough from Corin. I say lords because that is how they bore themselves, walking proudly in their own place, attended by human slaves. And the humans who were not slaves made way for them and were most deferential as though they knew that they were greatly favored to be allowed inside the city at all. The women of Shandakor were very beautiful, slim golden sprites with their bright eyes and pointed ears.</p>
    <p>And there were others. Slender creatures with great wings, some who were lithe and furred, some who were hairless and ugly and moved with a sinuous gliding, some so strangely shaped and colored that I could not even guess at their possible evolution.</p>
    <p>The lost races of Mars. The ancient races, of whose pride and power nothing was left but the half-forgotten tales of old men in the farthest corners of the planet. Even I, who had made the anthropological history of Mars my business, had never heard of them except as the distorted shapes of legend, as satyrs and giants used to be known on Earth.</p>
    <p>Yet here they were in gorgeous trappings, served by naked humans whose fetters were made of precious metals. And before them the merchants drew aside and bowed.</p>
    <p>The lights burned, many-colored—not the torches and cressets of the Mars I knew but cool radiances that fell from crystal globes. The walls of the buildings that rose around the market-place were faced with rare veined marbles and the fluted towers that crowned them were inlaid with turquoise and cinnabar, with amber and jade and the wonderful corals of the southern oceans.</p>
    <p>The splendid robes and the naked bodies moved in a swirling pattern about the square. There was buying and selling and I could see the mouths of the people open and shut. The mouths of the women laughed. But in all that crowded place there was no sound. No voice, no scuff of sandal, no chink of mail. There was only silence, the utter stillness of deserted places.</p>
    <p>I began to understand why there was no need to shut the gates. No superstitious barbarian would venture himself into a city peopled by living phantoms.</p>
    <p>And I—I was civilized. I was, in my non-mechanical way, a scientist. And had I not been trapped by my need for water and supplies I would have run away right out of the valley. But I had no place to run to and so I stayed and sweated and gagged on the acrid taste of fear.</p>
    <p>What were these creatures that made no sound? Ghosts—images—dreams? The human and the non-human, the ancient, the proud, the lost and forgotten who were so insanely present—did they have some subtle form of life I knew nothing about? Could they see me as I saw them? Did they have thought and volition of their own?</p>
    <p>It was the solidity of them, the intense and perfectly prosaic business in which they were engaged. Ghosts do not barter. They do not hang jeweled necklets upon their women nor argue about the price of a studded harness.</p>
    <p>The solidity and the silence—that was the worst of it. If there had been one small living sound . . .</p>
    <p>A dying city, Corin had said. The days are running out. What if they had run out? What if I were here in this massive pile of stone with all its countless rooms and streets and galleries and hidden ways, alone with the lights and the soundless phantoms?</p>
    <p>Pure terror is a nasty thing. I had it then.</p>
    <p>I began to move, very cautiously, along the wall. I wanted to get away from that market-place. One of the hairless gliding non-humans was bartering for a female slave. The girl was shrieking. I could see every drawn muscle in her face, the spasmodic working of her throat. Not the faintest sound came out.</p>
    <p>I found a street that paralleled the wall. I went along it, catching glimpses of people—human people—inside the lighted buildings. Now and then men passed me and I hid from them. There was still no sound. I was careful how I set my feet. Somehow I had the idea that if I made a noise something terrible would happen.</p>
    <p>A group of merchants came toward me. I stepped back into an archway and suddenly from behind me there came three spangled women of the serais. I was caught.</p>
    <p>I did not want those silent laughing women to touch me. I leaped back toward the street and the merchants paused, turning their heads. I thought that they had seen me. I hesitated and the women came on. Their painted eyes shone and their red lips glistened. The ornaments on their bodies flashed. They walked straight into me.</p>
    <p>I made noise then, all I had in my lungs. And the women passed through me. They spoke to the merchants and the merchants laughed. They went off together down the street. They hadn't seen me. They hadn't heard me. And when I got in their way I was no more than a shadow. They passed through me.</p>
    <p>I sat down on the stones of the street and tried to think. I sat for a long time. Men and women walked through me as through the empty air. I sought to remember any sudden pain, as of an arrow in the back that might have killed me between two seconds, so that I hadn't known about it. It seemed more likely that I should be the ghost than the other way around.</p>
    <p>I couldn't remember. My body felt solid to my hands as did the stones I sat on. They were cold and finally the cold got me up and sent me on again. There was no reason to hide any more. I walked down the middle of the street and I got used to not turning aside.</p>
    <p>I came to another wall, running at right angles back into the city. I followed that and it curved around gradually until I found myself back at the market-place, at the inner end of it. There was a gateway, with the main part of the city beyond it, and the wall continued. The non-humans passed back and forth through the gate but no human did except the slaves. I realized then that all this section was a ghetto for the humans who came to Shandakor with the caravans.</p>
    <p>I remembered how Corin had felt about me. And I wondered— granted that I were still alive and that some of the people of Shandakor were still on the same plane as myself—how they would feel about me if I trespassed in their city.</p>
    <p>There was a fountain in the market-place. The water sprang up sparkling in the colored light and filled a wide basin of carved stone. Men and women were drinking from it. I went to the fountain but when I put my hands in it all I felt was a dry basin filled with dust. I lifted my hands and let the dust trickle from them. I could see it clearly. But I saw the water too. A child leaned over and splashed it and it wetted the garments of the people. They struck the child and he cried and there was no sound.</p>
    <p>I went on through the gate that was forbidden to the human race.</p>
    <p>The avenues were wide. There were trees and flowers, wide parks and garden villas, great buildings as graceful as they were tall. A wise proud city, ancient in culture but not decayed, as beautiful as Athens but rich and strange, with a touch of the alien in every line of it. Can you think what it was like to walk in that city, among the silent throngs that were not human—to see the glory of it, that was not human either?</p>
    <p>The towers of jade and cinnabar, the golden minarets, the lights and the colored silks, the enjoyment and the strength. And the people of Shandakor! No matter how far their souls have gone they will never forgive me.</p>
    <p>How long I wandered I don't know. I had almost lost my fear in wonder at what I saw. And then, all at once in that deathly stillness, I heard a sound—the quick, soft scuffing of sandaled feet.</p>

    <p>I stopped where I was, in the middle of a plaza. The tall silver-crested ones drank wine under canopies of dusky blooms and in the center a score of winged girls as lovely as swans danced a slow strange measure that was more like flight than dancing. I looked all around. There were many people. How could you tell which one had made a noise?</p>
    <p>Silence.</p>
    <p>I turned and ran across the marble paving. I ran hard and then suddenly I stopped again, listening. Scuff-scuff—no more than a whisper, very light and swift. I spun around but it was gone. The soundless people walked and the dancers wove and shifted, spreading their white wings.</p>
    <p>Someone was watching me. Some one of those indifferent shadows was not a shadow.</p>
    <p>I went on. Wide streets led off from the plaza. I took one of them. I tried the trick of shifting pace and two or three times I caught the echo of other steps than mine. Once I knew it was deliberate. Whoever followed me slipped silently among the noiseless crowd, blending with them, protected by them, only making a show of footsteps now and then to goad me.</p>
    <p>I spoke to that mocking presence. I talked to it and listened to my own voice ringing hollow from the walls. The groups of people ebbed and flowed around me and there was no answer.</p>
    <p>I tried making sudden leaps here and there among the passersby with my arms outspread. But all I caught was empty air. I wanted a place to hide and there was none.</p>
    <p>The street was long. I went its length and the someone followed me. There were many buildings, all lighted and populous and deathly still. I thought of trying to hide in the buildings but I could not bear to be closed in between walls with those people who were not people.</p>
    <p>I came into a great circle, where a number of avenues met around the very tall tower I had seen with the revolving globe on top of it. I hesitated, not knowing which way to go. Someone was sobbing and I realized that it was myself, laboring to breathe. Sweat ran into the corners of my mouth and it was cold, and bitter.</p>
    <p>A pebble dropped at my feet with a brittle click.</p>
    <p>I bolted out across the square. Four or five times, without reason, like a rabbit caught in the open, I changed course and fetched up with my back against an ornamental pillar. From somewhere there came a sound of laughter.</p>
    <p>I began to yell. I don't know what I said. Finally I stopped and there was only the silence and the passing throngs, who did not see nor hear me. And now it seemed to me that the silence was full of whispers just below the threshold of hearing.</p>
    <p>A second pebble clattered off the pillar above my head. Another stung my body. I sprang away from the pillar. There was laughter and I ran.</p>
    <p>There were infinities of streets, all glowing with color. There were many faces, strange faces, and robes blown out on a night wind, litters with scarlet curtains and beautiful cars like chariots drawn by beasts. They flowed past me like smoke, without sound, without substance, and the laughter pursued me, and I ran.</p>
    <p>Four men of Shandakor came toward me. I plunged through them but their bodies opposed mine, their hands caught me and I could see their eyes, their black shining eyes, looking at me . . . .</p>
    <p>I struggled briefly and then it was suddenly very dark.</p>
    <p>The darkness caught me up and took me somewhere. Voices talked far away. One of them was a light young shiny sort of voice. It matched the laughter that had haunted me down the streets. I hated it.</p>
    <p>I hated it so much that I fought to get free of the black river that was carrying me. There was a vertiginous whirling of light and sound and stubborn shadow and then things steadied down and I was ashamed of myself for having passed out.</p>
    <p>I was in a room. It was fairly large, very beautiful, very old, the first place I had seen in Shandakor that showed real age—Martian age, that runs back before history had begun on Earth. The floor, of some magnificent somber stone the color of a moonless night, and the pale slim pillars that upheld the arching roof all showed the hollowings and smoothnesses of centuries. The wall paintings had dimmed and softened and the rugs that burned in pools of color on that dusky floor were worn as thin as silk.</p>
    <p>There were men and women in that room, the alien folk of Shandakor. But these breathed and spoke and were alive. One of them, a girl-child with slender thighs and little pointed breasts, leaned against a pillar close beside me. Her black eyes watched me, full of dancing lights. When she saw that I was awake again she smiled and flicked a pebble at my feet.</p>
    <p>I got up. I wanted to get that golden body between my hands and make it scream. And she said in High Martian, "Are you a human? I have never seen one before close to."</p>
    <p>A man in a dark robe said, "Be still, Duani." He came and stood before me. He did not seem to be armed but others were and I remembered Corin's little weapon. I got hold of myself and did none of the things I wanted to do.</p>
    <p>"What are you doing here?" asked the man in the dark robe.</p>
    <p>I told him about myself and Corin, omitting only the fight that he and I had had before he died, and I told him how the hillmen had robbed me.</p>
    <p>"They sent me here," I finished, "to ask for water."</p>
    <p>Someone made a harsh humorless sound. The man before me said, "They were in a jesting mood."</p>
    <p>"Surely you can spare some water and a beast!"</p>
    <p>"Our beasts were slaughtered long ago. And as for water . . ." He paused, then asked bitterly, "Don't you understand? We are dying here of thirst!"</p>
    <p>I looked at him and at the she-imp called Duani and the others. "You don't show any signs of it," I said.</p>
    <p>"You saw how the human tribes have gathered like wolves upon the hills. What do you think they wait for? A year ago they found and cut the buried aqueduct that brought water into Shandakor from the polar cap. All they needed then was patience. And their time is very near. The store we had in the cisterns is almost gone."</p>
    <p>A certain anger at their submissiveness made me say, "Why do you stay here and die like mice bottled up in a jar? You could have fought your way out. I've seen your weapons."</p>
    <p>"Our weapons are old and we are very few. And suppose that some of us did survive—tell me again, Earthman, how did Corin fare in the world of men?" He shook his head. "Once we were great and Shandakor was mighty. The human tribes of half a world paid tribute to us. We are only the last poor shadow of our race but we will not beg from men!"</p>
    <p>"Besides," said Duani softly, "where else could we live but in Shandakor?"</p>
    <p>"What about the others?" I asked. "The silent ones."</p>
    <p>"They are the past," said the dark-robed man and his voice rang like a distant flare of trumpets.</p>
    <p>Still I did not understand. I did not understand at all. But before I could ask more questions a man came up and said, "Rhul, he will have to die."</p>
    <p>The tufted tips of Duani's ears quivered and her crest of silver curls came almost erect.</p>
    <p>"No, Rhul" she cried. "At least not right away."</p>
    <p>There was a clamor from the others, chiefly in a rapid angular speech that must have predated all the syllables of men. And the one who had spoken before to Rhul repeated, "He will have to die! He has no place here. And we can't spare water."</p>
    <p>"I'll share mine with him," said Duani, "for a while."</p>
    <p>I didn't want any favors from her and said so. "I came here after supplies. You haven't any, so I'll go away again. It's as simple as that." I couldn't buy from the barbarians, but I might make shift to steal.</p>
    <p>Rhul shook his head. "I'm afraid not. We are only a handful. For years our single defense has been the living ghosts of our past who walk the streets, the shadows who man the walls. The barbarians believe in enchantments. If you were to enter Shandakor and leave it again alive the barbarians would know that the enchantment cannot kill. They would not wait any longer."</p>
    <p>Angrily, because I was afraid, I said, "I can't see what difference that would make. You're going to die in a short while anyway."</p>
    <p>"But in our own way, Earthman, and in our own time. Perhaps, being human, you can't understand that. It is a question of pride. The oldest race of Mars will end well, as it began."</p>
    <p>He turned away with a small nod of the head that said kill him—as easily as that. And I saw the ugly little weapons rise.</p>

    </title>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>There was a split second then that seemed like a year. I thought of many things but none of them were any good. It was a devil of a place to die without even a human hand to help me under. And then Duani flung her arms around me.</p>
    <p>"You're all so full of dying and big thoughts!" she yelled at them. "And you're all paired off or so old you can't do anything but think! What about me? I don't have anyone to talk to and I'm sick of wandering alone, thinking how I'm going to die! Let me have him just for a little while? I told you I'd share my water."</p>
    <p>On Earth a child might talk that way about a stray dog. And it is written in an old Book that a live dog is better than a dead lion. I hoped they would let her keep me.</p>
    <p>They did. Rhul looked at Duani with a sort of weary compassion and lifted his hand. "Wait," he said to the men with the weapons. "I have thought how this human may be useful to us. We have so little time left now that it is a pity to waste any of it, yet much of it must be used up in tending the machine. He could do that labor—and a man can keep alive on very little water."</p>
    <p>The others thought that over. Some of them dissented violently, not so much on the grounds of water as that it was unthinkable that a human should intrude on the last days of Shandakor. Corin had said the same thing. But Rhul was an old man. The tufts of his pointed ears were colorless as glass and his face was graven deep with years and wisdom had distilled in him its bitter brew.</p>
    <p>"A human of our own world, yes. But this man is of Earth and the men of Earth will come to be the new rulers of Mars as we were the old. And Mars will love them no better than she did us because they are as alien as we. So it is not unfitting that he should see us out."</p>
    <p>They had to be content with that. I think they were already so close to the end that they did not really care. By ones and twos they left as though already they had wasted too much time away from the wonders that there were in the streets outside. Some of the men still held the weapons on me and others went and brought precious chains such as the human slaves had worn—shackles, so that I should not escape. They put them on me and Duani laughed.</p>
    <p>"Come," said Rhul, "and I will show you the machine."</p>
    <p>He led me from the room and up a winding stair. There were tall embrasures and looking through them I discovered that we were in the base of the very high tower with the globe. They must have carried me back to it after Duani had chased me with her laughter and her pebbles. I looked out over the glowing streets, so full of splendor and of silence, and asked Rhul why there were no ghosts inside the tower.</p>
    <p>"You have seen the globe with the crystal rods?"</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>"We are under the shadow of its core. There had to be some retreat for us into reality. Otherwise we would lose the meaning of the dream."</p>
    <p>The winding stair went up and up. The chain between my ankles clattered musically. Several times I tripped on it and fell.</p>
    <p>"Never mind," Duani said. "You'll grow used to it."</p>
    <p>We came at last into a circular room high in the tower. And I stopped and stared.</p>
    <p>Most of the space in that room was occupied by a web of metal girders that supported a great gleaming shaft. The shaft disappeared upward through the roof. It was not tall but very massive, revolving slowly and quietly. There were traps, presumably for access to the offset shaft and the cogs that turned it. A ladder led to a trap in the roof.</p>
    <p>All the visible metal was sound with only a little surface corrosion. What the alloy was I don't know and when I asked Rhul he only smiled rather sadly. "Knowledge is found," he said, "only to be lost again. Even we of Shandakor forget."</p>
    <p>Every bit of that enormous structure had been shaped and polished and fitted into place by hand. Nearly all the Martian peoples work in metal. They seem to have a genius for it and while they are not and apparently never have been mechanical, as some of our races are on Earth, they find many uses for metal that we have never thought of.</p>
    <p>But this before me was certainly the high point of the metalworkers' craft. When I saw what was down below, the beautifully simple power plant and the rotary drive set-up with fewer moving parts than I would have thought possible, I was even more respectful. "How old is it?" I asked and again Rhul shook his head.</p>
    <p>"Several thousand years ago there is a record of the yearly Hosting of the Shadows and it was not the first." He motioned me to follow him up the ladder, bidding Duani sternly to remain where she was. She came anyway.</p>
    <p>There was a raised platform open to the universe and directly above it swung the mighty globe with its crystal rods that gleamed so strangely. Shandakor lay beneath us, a tapestry of many colors, bright and still, and out along the dark sides of the valley the tribesmen waited for the light to die.</p>
    <p>"When there is no one left to tend the machine it will stop in time and then the men who have hated us so long will take what they want of Shandakor. Only fear has kept them out this long. The riches of half a world flowed through these streets and much of it remained."</p>
    <p>He looked up at the globe. "Yes," he said, "we had knowledge. More, I think, than any other race of Mars."</p>
    <p>"But you wouldn't share it with the humans."</p>
    <p>Rhul smiled. "Would you give little children weapons to destroy you? We gave men better ploughshares and brighter ornaments and if they invented a machine we did not take it from them. But we did not tempt and burden them with knowledge that was not their own. They were content to make war with sword and spear and so they had more pleasure and less killing and the world was not torn apart."</p>
    <p>"And you—how did you make war?"</p>
    <p>"We defended our city. The human tribes had nothing that we coveted, so there was no reason to fight them except in self-defense. When we did we won." He paused. "The other non-human races were more stupid or less fortunate. They perished long ago."</p>
    <p>He turned again to his explanations of the machine. "It draws its power directly from the sun. Some of the solar energy is converted and stored within the globe to serve as the light-source. Some is sent down to turn the shaft."</p>
    <p>"What if it should stop." Duani said, "while we're still alive?" She shivered, looking out over the beautiful streets.</p>
    <p>"It won't—not if the Earthman wishes to live."</p>
    <p>"What would I have to gain by stopping it?" I demanded.</p>
    <p>"Nothing. And that," said Rhul, "is why I trust you. As long as the globe turns you are safe from the barbarians. After we are gone you will have the pick of the loot of Shandakor."</p>
    <p>How I was going to get away with it afterward he did not tell me.</p>
    <p>He motioned me down the ladder again but I asked him, "What is the globe, Rhul? How does it make the—the Shadows?"</p>
    <p>He frowned. "I can only tell you what has become, I'm afraid, mere traditional knowledge. Our wise men studied deeply into the properties of light. They learned that light has a definite effect upon solid matter and they believed, because of that effect, that stone and metal and crystalline things retain a 'memory' of all that they have 'seen.' Why this should be I do not know."</p>
    <p>I didn't try to explain to him the quantum theory and the photoelectric effect nor the various experiments of Einstein and Millikan and the men who followed them. I didn't know them well enough myself and the old High Martian is deficient in such terminology.</p>
    <p>I only said, "The wise men of my world also know that the impact of light tears away tiny particles from the substance it strikes."</p>
    <p>I was beginning to get a glimmering of the truth. Light-patterns "cut" in the electrons of metal and stone—sound-patterns cut in unlikely looking mediums of plastic, each needing only the proper "needle" to recreate the recorded melody or the recorded picture.</p>
    <p>"They constructed the globe," said Rhul. "I do not know how many generations that required nor how many failures they must have had. But they found at last the invisible light that makes the stones give up their memories."</p>
    <p>In other words they had found their needle. What wave-length or combination of wave-lengths in the electromagnetic spectrum flowed out from those crystal rods, there was no way for me to know. But where they probed the walls and the paving blocks of Shandakor they scanned the hidden patterns that were buried in them and brought them forth again in form and color—as the electron needle brings forth whole symphonies from a little ridged disc.</p>
    <p>How they had achieved sequence and selectivity was another matter. Rhul said something about the "memories" having different lengths. Perhaps he meant depth of penetration. The stones of Shandakor were ages old and the outer surfaces would have worn away. The earliest impressions would be gone altogether or at least have become fragmentary and extremely shallow.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the scanning beams could differentiate between the overlapping layers of impressions by that fraction of a micron difference in depth. Photons only penetrate so far into any given substance but if that substance is constantly growing less in thickness the photons would have the effect of going deeper. I imagine the globe was accurate in centuries or numbers of centuries, not in years.</p>
    <p>However it was, the Shadows of a golden past walked the streets of Shandakor and the last men of the race waited quietly for death, remembering their glory.</p>
    <p>Rhul took me below again and showed me what my tasks would be, chiefly involving a queer sort of lubricant and a careful watch over the power leads. I would have to spend most of my time there but not all of it. During the free periods, Duani might take me where she would.</p>
    <p>The old man went away. Duani leaned herself against a girder and studied me with intense interest. "How are you called?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"John Ross."</p>
    <p>"JonRoss," she repeated and smiled. She began to walk around me, touching my hair, inspecting my arms and chest, taking a child's delight in discovering all the differences there were between herself and what we call a human. And that was the beginning of my captivity.</p>

    <empty-line/>
    <p>There were days and nights, scant food and scanter water. There was Duani. And there was Shandakor. I lost my fear. And whether I lived to occupy the Chair or not, this was something to have seen.</p>
    <p>Duani was my guide. I was tender of my duties because my neck depended on them but there was time to wander in the streets, to watch the crowded pageant that was not and sense the stillness and the desolation that were so cruelly real. I began to get the feel of what this alien culture had been like and how it had dominated half a world without the need of conquest.</p>
    <p>In a Hall of Government, built of white marble and decorated with wall friezes of austere magnificence, I watched the careful choosing and the crowning of a king. I saw the places of learning. I saw the young men trained for war as fully as they were instructed in the arts of peace. I saw the pleasure gardens, the theaters, the forums, the sporting fields—and I saw the places of work, where the men and women of Shandakor coaxed beauty from their looms and forges to trade for the things they wanted from the human world.</p>
    <p>The human slaves were brought by their own kind to be sold, and they seemed to be well treated, as one treats a useful animal in which one has invested money. They had their work to do but it was only a small part of the work of the city.</p>
    <p>The things that could be had nowhere else on Mars—the tools, the textiles, the fine work in metal and precious stones, the glass and porcelain—were fashioned by the people of Shandakor and they were proud of their skill. Their scientific knowledge they kept entirely to themselves, except what concerned agriculture or medicine or better ways of building drains and houses.</p>
    <p>They were the lawgivers, the teachers. And the humans took all they would give and hated them for it. How long it had taken these people to attain such a degree of civilization Duani could not tell me. Neither could old Rhul.</p>
    <p>"It is certain that we lived in communities, had a form of civil government, a system of numbers and written speech, before the human tribes. There are traditions of an earlier race than ours, from whom we learned these things. Whether or not this is true I do not know."</p>
    <p>In its prime Shandakor had been a vast and flourishing city with countless thousands of inhabitants. Yet I could see no signs of poverty or crime. I couldn't even find a prison.</p>
    <p>"Murder was punishable by death," said Rhul, "but it was most infrequent. Theft was for slaves. We did not stoop to it." He watched my face, smiling a little acid smile. "That startles you—a great city without suffering or crime or places of punishment."</p>
    <p>I had to admit that it did. "Elder race or not, how did you manage to do it? I'm a student of cultures, both here and on my own world. I know all the usual patterns of development and I've read all the theories about them—but Shandakor doesn't fit any of them."</p>
    <p>Rhul's smile deepened. "You are human," he said. "Do you wish the truth?"</p>
    <p>"Of course."</p>
    <p>"Then I will tell you. We developed the faculty of reason."</p>
    <p>For a moment I thought he was joking. "Come," I said, "man is a reasoning being—on Earth the only reasoning being."</p>
    <p>"I do not know of Earth," he answered courteously. "But on Mars man has always said, I reason, I am above the beasts because I reason. And he has been very proud of himself because he could reason. It is the mark of his humanity. Being convinced that reason operates automatically within him he orders his life and his government upon emotion and superstition.</p>
    <p>"He hates and fears and believes, not with reason but because he is told to by other men or by tradition. He does one thing and says another and his reason teaches him no difference between fact and falsehood. His bloodiest wars are fought for the merest whim—and that is why we did not give him weapons. His greatest follies appear to him the highest wisdom, his basest betrayals become noble acts—and that is why we could not teach him justice. We learned to reason. Man only learned to talk."</p>
    <p>I understood then why the human tribes had hated the men of Shandakor. I said angrily, "Perhaps that is so on Mars. But only reasoning minds can develop great technologies and we humans of Earth have outstripped yours a million times. All right, you know or knew some things we haven't learned yet, in optics and some branches of electronics and perhaps in metallurgy. But . . ."</p>
    <p>I went on to tell him all the things we had that Shandakor did not. "You never went beyond the beast of burden and the simple wheel. We achieved flight long ago. We have conquered space and the planets. We'll go on to conquer the stars!"</p>
    <p>Rhul nodded. "Perhaps we were wrong. We remained here and conquered ourselves." He looked out toward the slopes where the barbarian army waited and he sighed. "In the end it is all the same."</p>
    <p>Days and nights and Duani, bringing me food, sharing her water, asking questions, taking me through the city. The only thing she would not show me was something they called the Place of Sleep. "I shall be there soon enough," she said and shivered.</p>
    <p>"How long?" I asked. It was an ugly thing to say.</p>
    <p>"We are not told. Rhul watches the level in the cisterns and when it's time . . . "She made a gesture with her hands. "Let us go up on the wall."</p>
    <p>We went up among the ghostly soldiery and the phantom banners. Outside there were darkness and death and the coming of death. Inside there were light and beauty, the last proud blaze of Shandakor under the shadow of its doom. There was an eerie magic in it that had begun to tell on me. I watched Duani. She leaned against the parapet, looking outward. The wind ruffled her silver crest, pressed her garments close against her body. Her eyes were full of moonlight and I could not read them. Then I saw that there were tears.</p>
    <p>I put my arm around her shoulders. She was only a child, an alien child, not of my race or breed . . .</p>
    <p>"JonRoss."</p>
    <p>"Yes?"</p>
    <p>"There are so many things I will never know."</p>
    <p>It was the first time I had touched her. Those curious curls stirred under my fingers, warm and alive. The tips of her pointed ears were soft as a kitten's.</p>
    <p>"Duani."</p>
    <p>"What?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know . . ."</p>
    <p>I kissed her. She drew back and gave me a startled look from those black brilliant eyes and suddenly I stopped thinking that she was a child and I forgot that she was not human and—I didn't care.</p>
    <p>"Duani, listen. You don't have to go to the Place of Sleep."</p>
    <p>She looked at me, her cloak spread out upon the night wind, her hands against my chest.</p>
    <p>"There's a whole world out there to live in. And if you aren't happy there I'll take you to my world, to Earth. There isn't any reason why you have to die!"</p>
    <p>Still she looked at me and did not speak. In the streets below the silent throngs went by and the towers glowed with many colors. Duani's gaze moved slowly to the darkness beyond the wall, to the barren valley and the hostile rocks.</p>
    <p>"No."</p>
    <p>"Why not? Because of Rhul, because of all this talk of pride and race?"</p>
    <p>"Because of truth. Corin learned it."</p>
    <p>I didn't want to think about Corin. "He was alone. You're not. You'd never be alone."</p>
    <p>She brought her hands up and laid them on my cheeks very gently. "That green star, that is your world. Suppose it were to vanish and you were the last of all the men of Earth. Suppose you lived with me in Shandakor forever—would you not be alone?"</p>
    <p>"It wouldn't matter if I had you."</p>
    <p>She shook her head. "It would matter. And our two races are as far apart as the stars. We would have nothing to share between us."</p>
    <p>Remembering what Rhul had told me I flared up and said some angry things. She let me say them and then she smiled. "It is none of that, JonRoss." She turned to look out over the city. "This is my place and no other. When it is gone I must be gone too."</p>
    <p>Quite suddenly I hated Shandakor.</p>
    <p>I didn't sleep much after that. Every time Duani left me I was afraid she might never come back. Rhul would tell me nothing and I didn't dare to question him too much. The hours rushed by like seconds and Duani was happy and I was not. My shackles had magnetic locks. I couldn't break them and I couldn't cut the chains.</p>
    <p>One evening Duani came to me with something in her face and in the way she moved that told me the truth long before I could make her put it into words. She clung to me, not wanting to talk, but at last she said, "Today there was a casting of lots and the first hundred have gone to the Place of Sleep."</p>
    <p>"It is the beginning, then."</p>
    <p>She nodded. "Every day there will be another hundred until all are gone."</p>
    <p>I couldn't stand it any longer. I thrust her away and stood up. "You know where the 'keys' are. Get these chains off me!"</p>
    <p>She shook her head. "Let us not quarrel now, JonRoss. Come. I want to walk in the city."</p>
    <p>We had quarreled more than once, and fiercely. She would not leave Shandakor and I couldn't take her out by force as long as I was chained. And I was not to be released until everyone but Rhul had entered the Place of Sleep and the last page of that long history had been written.</p>
    <p>I walked with her among the dancers and the slaves and the bright-cloaked princes. There were no temples in Shandakor. If they worshipped anything it was beauty and to that their whole city was a shrine. Duani's eyes were rapt and there was a remoteness on her now.</p>
    <p>I held her hand and looked at the towers of turquoise and cinnabar, the pavings of rose quartz and marble, the walls of pink and white and deep red coral, and to me they were hideous. The ghostly crowds, the mockery of life, the phantom splendors of the past were hideous, a drug, a snare.</p>
    <p>"The faculty of reason!" I thought and saw no reason in any of it.</p>
    <p>I looked up to where the great globe turned and turned against the sky, keeping these mockeries alive. "Have you ever seen the city as it is—without the Shadows?"</p>
    <p>"No. I think only Rhul, who is the oldest, remembers it that way. I think it must have been very lonely. Even then there were less than three thousand of us left."</p>
    <p>It must indeed have been lonely. They must have wanted the Shadows as much to people the empty streets as to fend off the enemies who believed in magic.</p>
    <p>I kept looking at the globe. We walked for a long time. And then I said, "I must go back to the tower."</p>
    <p>She smiled at me very tenderly. "Soon you will be free of the tower—and of these." She touched the chains. "No, don't be sad, JonRoss. You will remember me and Shandakor as one remembers a dream." She held up her face, that was so lovely and so unlike the meaty faces of human women, and her eyes were full of somber lights. I kissed her and then I caught her up in my arms and carried her back to the tower.</p>
    <p>In that room, where the great shaft turned, I told her, "I have to tend the things below. Go up onto the platform, Duani, where you can see all Shandakor. I'll be with you soon."</p>
    <p>I don't know whether she had some hint of what was in my mind or whether it was only the imminence of parting that made her look at me as she did. I thought she was going to speak but she did not, climbing the ladder obediently. I watched her slender golden body vanish upward. Then I went into the chamber below.</p>
    <p>There was a heavy metal bar there that was part of a manual control for regulating the rate of turn. I took it off its pin. Then I closed the simple switches on the power plant. I tore out all the leads and smashed the connections with the bar. I did what damage I could to the cogs and the offset shaft. I worked very fast. Then I went up into the main chamber again. The great shaft was still turning but slowly, ever more slowly.</p>
    <p>There was a cry from above me and I saw Duani. I sprang up the ladder, thrusting her back onto the platform. The globe moved heavily of its own momentum. Soon it would stop but the white fires still flickered in the crystal rods. I climbed up onto the railing, clinging to a strut. The chains on my wrists and ankles made it hard but I could reach. Duani tried to pull me down. I think she was screaming. I hung on and smashed the crystal rods with the bar, as many as I could.</p>
    <p>There was no more motion, no more light. I got down on the platform again and dropped the bar. Duani had forgotten me. She was looking at the city.</p>
    <p>The lights of many colors that had burned there were burning still but they were old and dim, cold embers without radiance. The towers of jade and turquoise rose up against the little moons and they were broken and cracked with time and there was no glory in them. They were desolate and very sad. The night lay clotted around their feet. The streets, the plazas and the market-squares were empty, their marble paving blank and bare. The soldiers had gone from the walls of Shandakor, with their banners and their bright mail, and there was no longer any movement anywhere within the gates.</p>
    <p>Duani let out one small voiceless cry. And as though in answer to it, suddenly from the darkness of the valley and the slopes beyond there rose a thin fierce howling as of wolves.</p>
    <p>"Why?" she whispered. "Why?" She turned to me. Her face was pitiful. I caught her to me.</p>
    <p>"I couldn't let you die! Not for dreams and visions, nothing. Look, Duani. Look at Shandakor." I wanted to force her to understand. "Shandakor is broken and ugly and forlorn. It is a dead city—but you're alive. There are many cities but only one life for you."</p>
    <p>Still she looked at me and it was hard to meet her eyes. She said, "We knew all that, JonRoss."</p>
    <p>"Duani, you're a child, you've only a child's way of thought. Forget the past and think of tomorrow. We can get through the barbarians. Corin did. And after that . . ."</p>
    <p>"And after that you would still be human—and I would not."</p>
    <p>From below us in the dim and empty streets there came a sound of lamentation. I tried to hold her but she slipped out from between my hands. "And I am glad that you are human," she whispered. "You will never understand what you have done."</p>
    <p>And she was gone before I could stop her, down into the tower.</p>
    <p>I went after her. Down the endless winding stairs with my chains clattering between my feet, out into the streets, the dark and broken and deserted streets of Shandakor. I called her name and her golden body went before me, fleet and slender, distant and more distant. The chains dragged upon my feet and the night took her away from me.</p>
    <p>I stopped. The whelming silence rushed smoothly over me and I was bitterly afraid of this dark dead Shandakor that I did not know. I called again to Duani and then I began to search for her in the shattered shadowed streets. I know now how long it must have been before I found her.</p>
    <p>For when I found her, she was with the others. The last people of Shandakor, the men and the women, the women first, were walking silently in a long line toward a low flat-roofed building that I knew without telling was the Place of Sleep.</p>
    <p>They were going to die and there was no pride in their faces now. There was a sickness in them, a sickness and a hurt in their eyes as they moved heavily forward, not looking, not wanting to look at the sordid ancient streets that I had stripped of glory.</p>
    <p>"Duani!" I called, and ran forward but she did not turn in her place in the line. And I saw that she was weeping.</p>
    <p>Rhul turned toward me, and his look had a weary contempt that was bitterer than a curse. "Of what use, after all, to kill you now?"</p>
    <p>"But I did this thing! I did it!"</p>
    <p>"You are only human."</p>
    <p>The long line shuffled on and Duani's little feet were closer to that final doorway. Rhul looked upward at the sky. "There is still time before the sunrise. The women at least will be spared the indignity of spears."</p>
    <p>"Let me go with her!"</p>
    <p>I tried to follow her, to take my place in line. And the weapon in Rhul's hand moved and there was the pain and I lay as Corin had lain while they went silently on into the Place of Sleep.</p>
    <p>The barbarians found me when they came, still half doubtful, into the city after dawn. I think they were afraid of me. I think they feared me as a wizard who had somehow destroyed all the folk of Shandakor.</p>
    <p>For they broke my chains and healed my wounds and later they even gave me out of the loot of Shandakor the only thing I wanted—a bit of porcelain, shaped like the head of a young girl.</p>
    <p>I sit in the Chair that I craved at the University and my name is written on the roll of the discoverers. I am eminent, I am respectable—I, who murdered the glory of a race.</p>
    <p>Why didn't I go after Duani into the Place of Sleep? I could have crawled! I could have dragged myself across those stones. And I wish to God I had. I wish that I had died with Shandakor!</p>

    <p>It was dark in the caves under Mercury. It was hot, and there was no sound in them but the slow plodding of Trevor's heavy boots.</p>
    <p>Trevor had been wandering for a long time, lost in this labyrinth where no human being had ever gone before. And Trevor was an angry man. Through no fault or will of his own he was about to die, and he was not ready to die. Moreover, it seemed a wicked thing to come to his final moment here in the stifling dark, buried under alien mountains high as Everest.</p>
    <p>He wished now that he had stayed in the valley. Hunger and thirst would have done for him just the same, but at least he would have died in the open like a man, and not like a rat trapped in a drain.</p>
    <p>Yet there was not really much to choose between them as a decent place to die. A barren little hell-hole the valley had been, even before the quake, with nothing to draw a man there except the hope of finding sun-stones, one or two of which could transform a prospector into a plutocrat.</p>
    <p>Trevor had found no sun-stones. The quake had brought down a whole mountain wall on his ship, leaving him with a pocket torch, a handful of food tablets, a canteen of water, and the scant clothing he stood in.</p>
    <p>He had looked at the naked rocks, and the little river frothing green with chemical poisons, and he had gone away into the tunnels, the ancient blowholes of a cooling planet, gambling that he might find a way out of the valleys.</p>
    <p>Mercury's Twilight Belt is cut into thousands of cliff-locked pockets, as a honeycomb is cut into cells. There is no way over the mountains, for the atmosphere is shallow, and the jagged peaks stand up into airless space. Trevor knew that only one more such pocket lay between him and the open plains. If he could get to and through that last pocket, he had thought . . .</p>
    <p>But he knew now that he was not going to make it.</p>
    <p>He was stripped to the skin already, in the terrible heat. When the weight of his miner's boots became too much to drag, he shed them, padding on over the rough rock with bare feet. He had nothing left now but the torch. When the light went, his last hope went with it.</p>
    <p>After a while it went.</p>
    <p>The utter blackness of the grave shut down. Trevor stood still, listening to the pulse of his own blood in the silence, looking at that which no man needs a light to see. Then he flung the torch away and stumbled on, driven to fight still by the terror which was greater than his weakness.</p>
    <p>Twice he struck against the twisting walls, and fell, and struggled up again. The third time he remained on hands and knees, and crawled.</p>
    <p>He crept on, a tiny creature entombed in the bowels of a planet. The bore grew smaller and smaller, tightening around him. From time to time he lost consciousness, and it became increasingly painful to struggle back to an awareness of the heat and the silence and the pressing rock.</p>
    <p>After one of these periods of oblivion he began to hear a dull, steady thunder. He could no longer crawl. The bore had shrunk to a mere crack, barely large enough for him to pass through worm-like on his belly. He sensed now a deep, shuddering vibration in the rock. It grew stronger, terrifying in that enclosed space. Steam slipped wraithlike into the smothering air.</p>
    <p>The roar and the vibration grew to an unendurable pitch. Trevor was near to strangling in the steam. He was afraid to go on, but there was no other way to go. Quite suddenly his hands went out into nothingness.</p>
    <p>The rock at the lip of the bore must have been rotten with erosion. It gave under his weight and pitched him headfirst into a thundering rush of water that was blistering hot and going somewhere in a great hurry through the dark.</p>
    <p>After that Trevor was not sure of anything. There was the scalding heat and the struggle to keep his head up and the terrible speed of the sub-Mercurian river racing on to its destiny. He struck rock several times, and once he held his breath for a whole eternity until the roof of the tunnel rose up again.</p>
    <p>He was only dimly aware of a long sliding fall downward through a sudden brightness. It was much cooler. He splashed feebly, because his brain had not told his body to stop, and the water did not fight him.</p>
    <p>His feet and hands struck solid bottom. He floundered on, and presently the water was gone. He made one attempt to rise. After that he lay still.</p>
    <p>The great mountains leaned away from the Sun. Night came, and with it violent storm and rain. Trevor did not know it. He slept, and when he woke the savage dawn was making the high cliffs flame with white light.</p>
    <p>Something was screaming above his head.</p>
    <p>Aching and leaden still with exhaustion, he roused up and looked about him.</p>
    <p>He sat on a beach of pale gray sand. At his feet were the shallows of a gray-green lake that filled a stony basin some half-mile in breadth. To his left the underground river poured out of the cliff-face, spreading into a wide, riffling fan of foam. Off to his right, the water spilled over the rim of the basin to become a river again somewhere below, and beyond the rim, veiled in mist and the shadow of a mountain wall, was a valley.</p>
    <p>Behind him, crowding to the edge of the sand, were trees and ferns and flowers, alien in shape and color but triumphantly alive. And from what he could see of it, the broad valley was green and riotous with growth. The water was pure, the air had a good smell, and it came to Trevor that he had made it. He was going to live a while longer, after all.</p>
    <p>Forgetting his weariness, he sprang up, and the thing that had hissed and screamed above him swooped down and passed the claw tip of a leathery wing so close to his face that it nearly gashed him. He stumbled backward, crying out, and the creature rose in a soaring spiral and swooped again.</p>
    <p>Trevor saw a sort of flying lizard, jet black except for a saffron belly. He raised his arms to ward it off, but it did not attack him, and as it swept by he saw something that woke in him amazement, greed, and a peculiarly unpleasant chill of fear.</p>
    <p>Around its neck the lizard-thing wore a golden collar. And set into the scaly flesh of its head—into the bone itself, it seemed—was a sun-stone. There was no mistaking that small vicious flash of radiance. Trevor had dreamed of sun-stones too long to be misled. He watched the creature rise again into the steamy sky and shivered, wondering who, or what, had set that priceless thing into the skull of a flying lizard—and why.</p>
    <p>It was the why that bothered him the most. Sun-stones are not mere adornments for wealthy ladies. They are rare, radioactive crystals, having a half-life one third greater than radium, and are used exclusively in the construction of delicate electronic devices dealing with frequencies above the first octave.</p>
    <p>Most of that relatively unexplored superspectrum was still a mystery. And the strangely jeweled and collared creature circling above him filled Trevor with a vast unease.</p>
    <p>It was not hunting. It did not wish to kill him. But it made no move to go away.</p>
    <p>From far down the valley, muted by distance to a solemn bell note that rolled between the cliffs, Trevor heard the booming of a great song.</p>
    <p>A sudden desire for concealment sent him in among the trees. He worked his way along the shore of the lake. Looking up through the branches he saw the black wings lift and turn, following him.</p>
    <p>The lizard was watching him with its bright, sharp eyes. It noted the path of his movements through the ferns and flowers, as a hawk watches a rabbit.</p>
    <p>He reached the lip of the basin where the water poured over in a cataract several hundred feet high. Climbing around the shoulder of a rocky bastion, Trevor had his first clear look at the valley.</p>
    <p>Much of it was still vague with mist. But it was broad and deep, with a sweep of level plain and clumps of forest, locked tight between the barrier mountains. And as he made out other details, Trevor's astonishment grew out of all measure.</p>
    <p>The land was under cultivation. There were clusters of thatched huts among the fields, and in the distance was a rock-built city, immense and unmistakable in the burning haze of dawn.</p>
    <p>Trevor crouched there, staring, and the winged lizard swung in lazy circles, watching, waiting, while he tried to think.</p>
    <p>A fertile valley such as this was rare enough in itself. But to find fields and a city was beyond belief. He had seen the aboriginal tribes that haunt some of the cliff-locked worlds of the Twilight Belt—sub-human peoples who live precariously among the bitter rocks and boiling springs, hunting the great lizards for food. None of this was ever built by them.</p>
    <p>Unless, in this environment, they had advanced beyond the Age of Stone . . .</p>
    <p>The gong sounded again its deep challenging note. Trevor saw the tiny figures of mounted men, no larger than ants at that distance, come down from the city and ride out across the plain.</p>
    <p>Relief and joy supplanted speculation in Trevor's mind. He was battered and starving, lost on an alien world, and anything remotely approaching the human and the civilized was better luck than he could have dreamed or prayed for.</p>
    <p>Besides, there were sun-stones in this place. He looked hungrily at the head of the circling watcher, and then began to scramble down the broken outer face of the bastion.</p>
    <p>The black wings slipped silently after him down the sky.</p>
    <p>About a hundred feet above the valley floor he came to an overhang. There was no way past it but to jump. He clung to a bush and let himself down as far as he could, and then dropped some four or five yards to a slope of springy turf. The fall knocked the wind out of him, and as he lay gasping a chill doubt crept into his mind.</p>
    <p>He could see the land quite clearly now, the pattern of the fields, the far-off city. Except for the group of riders, nothing stirred. The fields, the plain were empty of men, the little villages still as death. And he saw, swinging lazily above a belt of trees by the river, a second black-winged shadow, watching.</p>
    <p>The trees were not far away. The riders were coming toward them and him. It seemed to Trevor now that the men were perhaps a party of hunters, but there was something alarming about the utter disappearance of all other life. It was as though the gong had been a warning for all to take cover while the hunt was abroad.</p>
    <p>The sharp-eyed lizards were the hounds that went before to find and flush the game. Glancing up at the ominous sentinel above his own head, Trevor had a great desire to see what the quarry was that hid in the belt of trees.</p>
    <p>There was no way back to the partial security of the lake basin. The overhang cut him off from that. The futility of trying to hide was apparent, but nevertheless he wormed in among some crimson ferns. The city was at his left. To the right, the fertile plain washed out into a badland of lava and shattered rock, which narrowed and vanished around a shoulder of purple basalt. This defile was still in deep shadow.</p>
    <p>The riders were still far away. He saw them splash across a ford, toy figures making little bursts of spray.</p>
    <p>The watcher above the trees darted suddenly downward. The quarry was breaking cover.</p>
    <p>Trevor's suspicions crystallized into an ugly certainty. Horror-struck, he watched the bronzed, half-naked figure of a girl emerge from the brilliant undergrowth and run like an antelope toward the badland.</p>
    <p>The flying lizard rose, swooped, and struck.</p>
    <p>The girl flung herself aside. She carried a length of sapling bound with great thorns, and she lashed out with it at the black brute, grazed it, and ran on.</p>
    <p>The lizard circled and came at her again from behind.</p>
    <p>She turned. There was a moment of vicious confusion, in which the leathery wings enveloped her in a kind of dreadful cloak, and then she was running again, but less swiftly, and Trevor could see the redness of blood on her body.</p>
    <p>And again the flying demon came.</p>
    <p>The thing was trying to head her, turn her back toward the huntsmen. But she would not be turned. She beat with her club at the lizard, and ran, and fell, and ran again. And Trevor knew that she was beaten. The brute would have the life out of her before she reached the rocks.</p>
    <p>Every dictate of prudence told Trevor to stay out of this. Whatever was going on was obviously the custom of the country, and none of his business. All he wanted was to get hold of one of these sun-stones and then find a way out of this valley. That was going to be trouble enough without taking on any more.</p>
    <p>But prudence was swept away in the fury that rose in him as he saw the hawk swoop down again, with its claws outspread and hungry for the girl's tormented flesh. He sprang up, shouting to her to fight, to hang on, and went running full speed down the slope toward her.</p>
    <p>She turned upon him a face of such wild, fierce beauty as he had never seen, the eyes dark and startled and full of a terrible determination. Then she screamed at him, in his own tongue, "Look out!"</p>
    <p>He had forgotten his own nemesis. Black wings, claws, the lash of a scaly tail striking like a whip, and Trevor went down, rolling over and staining the turf red as he rolled.</p>
    <p>From far off he heard the voices of the huntsmen, shrill and strident, lifted in a wild halloo.</p>

    <p>For some reason the assault steadied Trevor. He got to his feet and took the club out of the girl's hands, regretting the gun that was buried under a ton of rock on the other side of the mountains.</p>
    <p>"Keep behind me," he said. "Watch my back."</p>
    <p>She stared at him strangely, but there was no time for questions. They began to run together toward the badland. It seemed a long way off. The lizards screamed and hissed above them. Trevor hefted the club. It was about the size and weight of a baseball bat. He had once been very good at baseball.</p>
    <p>"They're coming," said the girl.</p>
    <p>"Lie down flat," he told her, and went on, more slowly. She dropped behind him in the grass, her fingers closing over a fragment of stone. The wide wings whistled down.</p>
    <p>Trevor braced himself. He could see the evil eyes, yellow and bright as the golden collars, and the brilliant flash of the sun-stones against the jetty scales of the head. They were attacking together, but at different angles, so that he could not face them both.</p>
    <p>He chose the one that was going to reach him first, and waited. He let it get close, very close, diving swiftly with its scarlet tongue forking out of its hissing mouth and its sharp claws spread. Then he swung the club with all his might.</p>
    <p>It connected. He felt something break. The creature screamed, and then the force of its dive carried it on into him and he lost his footing in a welter of thrashing wings and floundering body. He fell, and the second lizard was on him.</p>
    <p>The girl rose. In three long strides she reached him and flung herself upon the back of the scaly thing that ravaged him. He saw her trying to pin it to the ground, hammering methodically at its head with the stone.</p>
    <p>He kicked off the wounded one. He had broken its neck, but it was in no hurry to die. He caught up the club and presently the second brute was dead. Trevor found it quite easy to pick up the sun-stone.</p>
    <p>He held it in his hand, a strange, tawny, jewel-like thing, with a scrap of bone still clinging to it. It glinted with inner fires, deep and subtle, and an answering spark of wild excitement was kindled in Trevor from the very touch and feel of it, so that he forgot where he was or what he was doing, forgot everything but the eerie crystal that gleamed against his palm.</p>
    <p>It was more than a jewel, more even than wealth, that he held there. It was hope and success and a new life.</p>
    <p>He had thrown years away prospecting the bitter Mercurian wastes. This trip had been his last gamble, and it had ended with his ship gone, his quest finished, and nothing to look forward to even if he did get back safely, but to become one of the penniless, aging planet-drifters he'd always pitied.</p>
    <p>Now all that was changed. This single stone would let him go back to Earth a winner and not a failure. It would pay off all the dreary, lonesome, hazardous years. It would . . .</p>
    <p>It would do so many things if he could get out of this Godforsaken valley with it! If!</p>
    <p>The girl had got her breath again. Now she said urgently, "Come! They're getting near!"</p>
    <p>Trevor's senses, bemused by the sun-stone, registered only vaguely the external stimuli of sight and sound. The riders had come closer. The beasts they rode were taller and slighter than horses. They were not hoofed, but clawed. They had narrow, vicious-looking heads with spiny crests that stood up erect and arrogant. They came fast, carrying their riders lightly.</p>
    <p>The men were still too far away to distinguish features, but even at that distance Trevor sensed something peculiar about their faces, something unnatural. They wore splendid harness, and their half-clad bodies were bronzed, but not nearly so deeply as the girl's.</p>
    <p>The girl shook him furiously, stirring him out of his dream. "Do you want to be taken alive? Before, the beasts would have torn us apart, and that is quickly over. But we killed the hawks, don't you understand? Now they will take us alive!"</p>
    <p>He did not understand in the least, but her obvious preference for a very nasty death instead of capture made him find reserves of strength he thought he had lost in the underground river. There was also the matter of the sun-stone. If they caught him with it they would want it back.</p>
    <p>Clutching the precious thing he turned with the girl and ran.</p>
    <p>The lava bed was beginning to catch the sun now. The splintered rock showed through, bleak and ugly. The badland and the defile beyond seemed like an entrance into hell, but it did offer shelter of a sort if they could make it.</p>
    <p>The drumming of padded feet behind was loud in his ears. He glanced over his shoulder, once. He could see the faces of the huntsmen now. They were not good faces, in either feature or expression, and he saw the thing about them that he had noticed before, the unnatural thing.</p>
    <p>In the center of each forehead, above the eyes, a sun-stone was set into flesh and bone.</p>
    <p>First the hawk-lizards, and now these . . .</p>
    <p>Trevor's heart contracted with an icy pang. These men were human, as human as himself, and yet they were not. They were alien and wicked and altogether terrifying, and he began to understand why the girl did not wish to come alive into their hands.</p>
    <p>Fleet, implacable, the crested mounts with their strange riders were sweeping in upon the two who fled. The leader took from about his saddle a curved throwing stick and held it, poised. The sun-stone set in his brow flashed like a third, and evil eye.</p>
    <p>The lava and the fangs of rock shimmered in the light. Trevor yearned toward them. The brown girl running before him seemed to shimmer also. It hurt very much to breathe. He thought he could not go any farther. But he did, and when the girl faltered he put his arm around her and steadied her on.</p>
    <p>He continued to keep an eye out behind him. He saw the curved stick come hurtling toward him and he managed to let it go by. The others were ready now as they came within range. It seemed to Trevor that they were watching him with a peculiar intensity, as though they had recognized him as a stranger and had almost forgotten the girl in their desire to take him.</p>
    <p>His bare feet trod on lava already growing hot under the sun. A spur of basalt reared up and made a shield against the throwing sticks. In a minute or two Trevor and the girl were hidden in a terrain of such broken roughness as the man had seldom seen. It was as though some demoniac giant had whipped the molten lava with a pudding-spoon, cracking mountains with his free hand and tossing in the pieces. He understood now why the girl had waited for daylight to make her break. To attempt this passage in the dark would be suicidal.</p>
    <p>He listened nervously for sounds of pursuit. He could not hear any, but he remained uneasy, and when the girl flung herself down to rest, he asked,</p>
    <p>"Shouldn't we go farther? They might still come."</p>
    <p>She did not answer him at once, beyond a shake of the head. He realized that she was looking at him almost as intently as the riders had. It was the first chance she had had to examine him, and she was making the most of it. She noted the cut of his hair, the stubble of beard, the color and texture of his skin, the rags of his shorts that were all he had to cover him. Very carefully she noted them, and then she said in an odd slow voice, as though she were thinking of something else,</p>
    <p>"Mounted, the Korins are afraid of nothing. But afoot, and in here, they are afraid of ambush. It has happened before. They can die, you know, just the same as we do."</p>
    <p>Her face, for all its youth, was not the face of a girl. It was a woman who looked at Trevor, a woman who had already learned the happy, the passionate, and the bitter things, who had lived with pain and fear and knew better than to trust anyone but herself.</p>
    <p>"You aren't one of us," she said.</p>
    <p>"No. I came from beyond the mountains." He could not tell whether she believed him or not. "Who, or what, are the Korins?"</p>
    <p>"The lords of Korith," she answered, and began to tear strips from the length of white linen cloth she wore twisted about her waist. "There will be time to talk later. We still have far to go. Here, this will stop the bleeding."</p>
    <p>In silence they bound each other's wounds and started off again. If Trevor had not been so unutterably weary, and the way so hard, he would have been angry with the girl. And yet there was nothing really to be angry about except that he sensed she was somehow suspicious of him.</p>
    <p>Many times they had to stop and rest. Once he asked her, "Why were they—the Korins—hunting you?"</p>
    <p>"I was running away. Why were they hunting you?"</p>
    <p>"Damned if I know. Accident, perhaps. I happened to be where their hawks were flying."</p>
    <p>The girl wore a chain of iron links around her neck, a solid chain with no clasp, too small to be pulled over the head. From it hung a round tag with a word stamped on it. Trevor took the tag in his hand.</p>
    <p>"Galt," he read. "Is that your name?"</p>
    <p>"My name is Jen. Galt is the Korin I belong to. He led the hunt." She gave Trevor a look of fierce and challenging pride and said, as though she were revealing a secret earldom, "I am a slave."</p>
    <p>"How long have you been in the valley, Jen? You and I are the same stock, speaking the same language. Earth stock. How does it happen, a colony of this size that no one ever heard of?"</p>
    <p>"It's been nearly three hundred years since the Landing," she answered. "I have been told that for generations my people kept alive the hope that a ship would come from Earth and release them from the Korins. It never came. And, except by ship, there is no way in or out of the valley."</p>
    <p>Trevor glanced at her sharply. "I found a way in, all right, and I'm beginning to wish I hadn't. And if there's no way out, where are we going?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know myself," said Jen, and rose. "But my man came this way, and others before him."</p>
    <p>She went on, and Trevor went with her. There was no place else to go.</p>
    <p>The heat was unbearable, and they crept in the shadows of the rocks wherever they could. They suffered from thirst, but there was no water. The shoulder of purple basalt loomed impossibly tall before them, and seemed never to grow nearer.</p>
    <p>For most of the day they toiled across the lava bed, and at last, when they had almost forgotten that they had ever dreamed of doing it, they rounded the shoulder and came staggering out of the badland into a narrow canyon that seemed like the scar of some cataclysmic wound in the mountain.</p>
    <p>Rock walls, raw and riven, rose out of sight on either side, the twisted strata showing streaks of crimson and white and sullen ochre. A little stream crawled in a stony bed, and not much grew beside it.</p>
    <p>Jen and Trevor fell by the stream. And while they were still sprawled on the moist gravel, lapping like dogs at the bitter water, men came quietly from among the rocks and stood above them, holding weapons made of stone.</p>
    <p>Trevor got slowly to his feet. There were six of these armed men. Like the girl, they wore loin cloths of white cotton, much frayed, and like her they were burned almost black by a lifetime of exposure to a brutal sun. They were all young, knotted and sinewy from hard labor, their faces grim beyond their years. All bore upon their bodies the scars of talons. And they looked at Trevor with a cold, strange look.</p>
    <p>They knew Jen, or most of them did. She called them gladly by name, and demanded, "Hugh. Where is Hugh?"</p>
    <p>One of them nodded toward the farther wall. "Up there in the caves. He's all right. Who is this man, Jen?"</p>
    <p>She turned to study Trevor.</p>
    <p>"I don't know. They were hunting him, too. He came to help me. I couldn't have escaped without him. He killed the hawks. But . . ." She hesitated, choosing her words carefully. "He says he came from beyond the mountains. He knows of Earth and speaks our tongue. And when he killed the hawks he smashed the skull of one and took the sun-stone."</p>
    <p>All six started at that. And the tallest of them, a young man with a face as bleak and craggy as the rocks around them, came toward Trevor.</p>
    <p>"Why did you take the sun-stone?" he asked. His voice held an ugly edge.</p>
    <p>Trevor stared at him. "Why the devil do you suppose? Because it's valuable."</p>
    <p>The man held out his hand. "Give it to me."</p>
    <p>"The hell I will!" cried Trevor furiously. He backed away, just a little, getting set.</p>
    <p>The young man came on, and his face was dark and dangerous.</p>
    <p>"Saul, wait!" cried Jen.</p>
    <p>Saul didn't wait. He kept right on coming. Trevor let him get close before he swung, and he put every ounce of his strength behind the blow.</p>
    <p>The smashing fist took Saul squarely in the belly and sent him backward, doubled up. Trevor stood with hunched shoulders, breathing hard, watching the others with feral eyes.</p>
    <p>"What are you?" he snarled. "A bunch of thieves? All right, come on! I got that stone the hard way and I'm going to keep it!"</p>
    <p>Big words. A big anger. And a big fear behind them. The men were around him in a ring now. There was no chance of breaking away. Even if he did he was so winded they could pull him down in minutes. The stone weighed heavy in his pocket, heavy as half a lifetime of sweat and hunger and hard work, on the rockpiles of Mercury.</p>
    <p>Saul straightened up. His face was still gray, but he bent again and picked up a sharp-pointed implement of rock that he had dropped. Then he moved forward. And the others closed in, at the same time, quite silently.</p>
    <p>There was a bitter taste in Trevor's mouth as he waited for them. To get his hands on a sun-stone at last, and then to lose it and probably his life too, to this crowd of savages! It was more than anybody ought to be asked to bear.</p>
    <p>"Saul, wait!" cried Jen again, pushing in front of him. "He saved my life! You can't just . . ."</p>
    <p>"He's a Korin. A spy."</p>
    <p>"He can't be! There's no stone in his forehead. Not even a scar."</p>
    <p>Saul's voice was flat and relentless. "He took a sun-stone. Only a Korin would touch one of the cursed things."</p>
    <p>"But he says he's from outside the valley! From Earth, Saul. From Earth! Things would be different there."</p>
    <p>Jen's insistence on that point had at least halted the men temporarily. And Trevor, looking at Saul's face, had suddenly begun to understand something.</p>
    <p>"You think the sun-stones are evil," he said.</p>
    <p>Saul gave him a somber glance. "They are. And the one you have is going to be destroyed. Now."</p>
    <p>Trevor swallowed the bitter anguish that choked him, and did some fast thinking. If the sun-stones had a superstitious significance in this benighted pocket of Mercury—and he could imagine why they might, with those damned unnatural hawks flying around with the equally unnatural Korins—that put a different light on their attitude.</p>
    <p>He knew just by looking at their faces that it was "give them the sun-stone or die." Dying at the hands of a bunch of wild fanatics didn't make sense. Better let them have the stone and gamble on getting it back again later. Or on getting another one. They seemed plentiful enough in the valley!</p>
    <p>Sure, let's be sensible about it. Let's hand over a lifetime of hoping to a savage with horny palms, and not worry about it. Let's . . . Oh, hell.</p>
    <p>"Here," he said. "All right. Take it."</p>
    <p>It hurt. It hurt like giving up his own heart.</p>
    <p>Saul took it without thanks. He turned and laid it on a flat surface of rock, and began to pound the glinting crystal with the heavy stone he had meant to use on Trevor's head. There was a look on his lined, young, craggy face as though he was killing a living thing—a thing that he feared and hated.</p>
    <p>Trevor shivered. He knew that sun-stones were impervious to anything but atomic bombardment. But it made him a little sick, none the less, to see that priceless object being battered by a crude stone club.</p>
    <p>"It won't break," he said. "You might as well stop."</p>
    <p>Saul flung down his weapon so close to Trevor's bare feet that he leaped back. Then he picked up the sun-stone and hurled it as far as he could across the ravine. Trevor heard it clicking faintly as it fell, in among the rocks and rubble at the foot of the opposite cliff. He strained to mark the spot.</p>
    <p>"You idiot!" he said to Saul. "You've thrown away a fortune. The fortune I've spent my life trying to find. What's the matter with you? Don't you have any idea at all what those things are worth?"</p>
    <p>Saul ignored him, speaking bleakly to the others. "No man with a sun-stone is to be trusted. I say kill him."</p>
    <p>Jen said stubbornly, "No, Saul. I owe him my life."</p>
    <p>"But he could be a slave, a traitor, working for the Korins."</p>
    <p>"Look at his clothes," said Jen. "Look at his skin. This morning it was white, now it's red. Did you ever see a slave that color? Or a Korin, either. Besides, did you ever see him in the valley before? There aren't as many of us as that."</p>
    <p>"We can't take any chances," Saul said. "Not us."</p>
    <p>"You can always kill him later. But if he is from beyond the mountains, perhaps even from Earth—" She said the word hesitantly, as though she did not quite believe there was such a place. "He might know some of the things we've been made to forget. He might help us. Anyway, the others have a right to their say before you kill him."</p>
    <p>Saul shook his head. "I don't like it. But—" He hesitated, scowling thoughtfully. "All right. We'll settle it up in the cave. Let's move." He said to Trevor, "You go in the middle of us. And if you try to signal anyone . . ."</p>
    <p>"Who the devil would I signal to?" retorted Trevor angrily. "Listen, I'm sorry I ever got into your bloody valley."</p>
    <p>But he was not sorry. Not quite.</p>
    <p>His senses were on the alert to mark every twist and turn of the way they went, the way that would bring him back to the sun-stone. The ravine narrowed and widened and twisted, but there was only one negotiable path, and that was beside the stream bed. This went on for some distance, and then the ravine split on a tremendous cliff of bare rock that tilted up and back as though arrested in the act of falling over. The stream flowed from the left-hand fork. Saul took the other one.</p>
    <p>They kept close watch on Trevor as he slipped and clambered and sprawled along with them. The detritus of the primeval cataclysm that had shaped this crack in the mountains lay where it had fallen, growing rougher and more dangerous with every eroding storm and cracking frost.</p>
    <p>Above him, on both sides, the mountain tops went up and still up, beyond the shallow atmosphere. Their half-seen summits leaned and quivered like things glimpsed from under water, lit like torches by the naked blaze of the sun. There were ledges, lower down. Trevor saw men crouched upon them, among heaps of piled stones. They shouted, and Saul answered them. In this narrow throat no man could get through alive if they chose to stop him.</p>
    <p>After a while they left the floor of the ravine and climbed a path, partly natural and partly so roughly hewn that it seemed natural. It angled steeply up the cliff-face, and at its end was a narrow hole. Saul led the way through it. In single file the others followed, and Trevor heard Jen's voice echoing in some great hollow space beyond, calling Hugh.</p>
    <p>There was a cave inside, a very large cave with dim nooks and crannies around its edges. Shafts of sunlight pierced it here and there from cracks in the cliff-face high above, and far at the back of it, where the floor tipped sharply down, a flame burned. Trevor had seen flames like that before on Mercury, where volcanic gases blowing up through a fissure had ignited from some chance spark. It was impressive, a small bluish column twisting upward into rock-curtained distance and roaring evilly. He could feel the air rush past him as the burning pillar sucked it in.</p>
    <p>There were people in the cave. Less than a hundred, Trevor thought, not counting a handful of children and striplings. Less than a third of those were women. They all bore the same unmistakable stamp. Hard as life must be for them in the cave, it had been harder before.</p>
    <p>He felt his legs buckling under him with sheer weariness. He stood groggily with his back against the rough cave wall.</p>
    <p>A stocky young man with knotted shoulder-muscles and sun-bleached hair was holding Jen in his arms. That would be Hugh. He, and the others, were shouting excitedly, asking and answering questions.</p>
    <p>Then, one by one, they caught sight of Trevor. And gradually a silence grew and spread.</p>
    <p>"All right," said Saul harshly, looking at Trevor. "Let's get this settled."</p>
    <p>"You settle it," said Trevor. "I'm tired." He glared at Saul and the unfriendly staring crowd, and they seemed to rock in his vision. "I'm an Earthman. I didn't want to come into your damned valley, and I've been here a night and a day and haven't slept. I'm going to sleep."</p>
    <p>Saul started to speak again but Jen's man, Hugh, came up and stood in front of him.</p>
    <p>"He saved Jen's life," Hugh said. "Let him sleep."</p>
    <p>He led Trevor away to a place at the side where there were heaps of dried vines and mountain creepers, prickly and full of dust but softer than the cave floor. Trevor managed a few vague words of thanks and was asleep before they were out of his mouth.</p>
    <p>Hours, weeks, or perhaps it was only minutes later, a rough persistent shaking brought him to again. Faces bent over him. He saw them through a haze, and the questions they asked penetrated to him slowly, and without much meaning.</p>
    <p>"Why did you want the sun-stone?"</p>
    <p>"Why wouldn't I want it? I could take it back to Earth and sell it for a fortune."</p>
    <p>"What do they do with sun-stones on Earth?"</p>
    <p>"Build gadgets, super-electronic, to study things. Wave-lengths too short for anything else to pick up. Thought-waves, even. What do you care?"</p>
    <p>"Do they wear sun-stones in their foreheads, on Earth?"</p>
    <p>"No . . ." His voice trailed off, and the voices, or the dream of voices, left him.</p>
    <p>It was still daylight when he woke, this time normally. He sat up, feeling stiff and sore but otherwise rested. Jen came to him, smiling, and thrust a chunk of what he recognized as some species of rock-lizard into his hands. He gnawed at it wolfishly while she talked, having discovered that this was not the same day, but the next one, and quite late.</p>
    <p>"They have decided," she said, "to let you live."</p>
    <p>"I imagine you had a lot to do with that. Thanks."</p>
    <p>She shrugged her bare shoulders, with the raw wounds on them where the hawk-lizards had clawed her. She had that exhausted, let-down look that comes after tremendous stress, and her eyes, even while she spoke to Trevor, followed Hugh as he worked at some task around the cave.</p>
    <p>"I couldn't have done anything if they hadn't believed your story," she told him. "They questioned you when you were too far gone to lie." He had a very dim memory of that. "They didn't understand your answers but they knew they were true ones. Also they examined your clothes. No cloth like that is woven in the valley. And the things that hold them together—" he knew she meant the zippers "—are unknown to us. So you must have come from beyond the mountains. They want to know exactly how, and if you could get back the same way."</p>
    <p>"No," said Trevor, and explained. "Am I free to move around, then—go where I want to?"</p>
    <p>She studied him a moment before she spoke. "You're a stranger. You don't belong with us. You could betray us to the Korins just as easily as not."</p>
    <p>"Why would I do that? They hunted me, too."</p>
    <p>"For sun-stones, perhaps. You're a stranger. They would take you alive. Anyway, be careful. Be very careful what you do." From outside came a cry. "Hawks! Take cover, hawks!"</p>

    <p>Instantly everyone in the cave fell silent. They watched the places in the cave wall where the sunlight came in, the little cracks in the cliff-face. Trevor thought of the hawk-creatures, and how they would be wheeling and slipping along the ravine, searching.</p>
    <p>Outside, the rough rock looked all alike. He thought that in that immensity of erosions and crevices they would have a hard time finding the few tiny chinks that led into the cave. But he watched, too, tense with a feeling of danger.</p>
    <p>No sound at all came now from the ravine. In that utter stillness, the frightened whimper of a child came with the sudden loudness of a scream. It was instantly hushed. The shafts of sunlight crept slowly up the walls. Jen seemed not to breathe. Her eyes shone, like an animal's.</p>
    <p>A black shadow flickered across one of the sunlight bars-flickered, and then was gone. Trevor's heart turned over. He waited for it to come back, to occlude that shaft of light, to slip in along it and become a wide-winged demon with a sun-stone in its brow. For a whole eternity he waited, but it didn't come back, and then a man crept in through the entry hole and said, "They're gone."</p>
    <p>Jen put her head down on her knees. She had begun to tremble all over, very quietly, but with spasmodic violence. Before Trevor could reach her, Hugh had her in his arms, talking to her, soothing her. She began to sob then, and Hugh glanced at Trevor across her shoulders.</p>
    <p>"She's had a little too much."</p>
    <p>"Yes." Trevor looked at the shafts of sunlight. "Do the hawks come very often?"</p>
    <p>"They send them every once in a while hoping to catch us off guard. If they could find the cave they could hunt us out of it, drive us back into the valley. So far they haven't found it."</p>
    <p>Jen was quiet now. Hugh stroked her with big awkward hands. "She told you, I guess. About yourself, I mean. You've got to be careful."</p>
    <p>"Yes," said Trevor. "She told me." He leaned forward. "Listen, I still don't know how you people got here or what it's all about. After we got away from the Korins, Jen said something about a landing, three hundred years ago. Three hundred Earth years?"</p>
    <p>"About that. Some of us have remembered enough to keep track."</p>
    <p>"The first Earth colonies were being started on Mercury about then, in two or three of the bigger valleys. Mining colonies. Was this one of them?"</p>
    <p>Hugh shook his head. "No. The story is that there was a big ship loaded with people from Earth. That's true, of course, because the ship is still here, what's left of it. And so are we. Some of the people on the ship were settlers and some were convicts."</p>
    <p>He pronounced the word with the same hatred and scorn that always accompanied the name "Korin." Trevor said eagerly,</p>
    <p>"They used to do that in the early days. Use convict labor in the mines. It made so much trouble they had to stop it. Were the Korins . . . !"</p>
    <p>"They were the convicts. The big ship crashed in the valley but most of the people weren't killed. After the crash the convicts killed the men who were in charge of the ship, and made the settlers obey them. That's how it all started. And that's why we're proud we're slaves—because we're descended from the settlers."</p>
    <p>Trevor could see the picture quite clearly now, the more so because it had happened before in one way or another. The emigrant ship bound for one of the colonies, driven off its course by the tremendous magnetic disturbances that still made Mercury a spaceman's nightmare.</p>
    <p>They couldn't even have called for help or given their position. The terrible nearness of the Sun made any form of radio communication impossible. And then the convicts had broken free and killed the officers, finding themselves unexpectedly in command of a sort of paradise, with the settlers to serve them.</p>
    <p>A fairly safe paradise, too. Mercury has an infinite number of these Twilight valleys, all looking more or less alike from space, half hidden under their shallow blankets of air, and only the few that are both accessible and unmistakable because of their size have permanent colonies. Straight up and down, by spaceship, is the only way in or out of most of them, and unless a ship should land directly on them by sheer chance, the erstwhile prisoners would be safe from discovery.</p>
    <p>"But the sun-stones?" asked Trevor, touching his forehead.</p>
    <p>"What about the sun-stones and the hawks? They didn't have the use of them when they landed."</p>
    <p>"No, they came later." Hugh looked around uneasily. "Look, Trevor, it's a thing we don't talk about much. You can see why, when you think what it's done to us. And it's a thing you shouldn't talk about at all."</p>
    <p>"But how did they get them in their heads? And why? Especially, why do they waste them on the hawks?"</p>
    <p>Jen glanced at him somberly from the circle of Hugh's arm. "We don't know, exactly. But the hawks are the eyes and ears of the Korins. And from the time they used the first sun-stone we've had no hope of getting free from them."</p>
    <p>The thing that had been buried in Trevor's subconscious since last night's questioning came suddenly to the surface.</p>
    <p>"Thought-waves, that's it! Sure!" He leaned forward excitedly, and Jen told him frantically to lower his voice. "I'll be damned. They've been experimenting with sun-stones for years on Earth-ever since they were discovered, but the scientists never thought of . . ."</p>
    <p>"Do they have the stones on Earth, too?" asked Jen, with loathing.</p>
    <p>"No, no, only the ones that are brought from Mercury. Something about Mercury being so close to the Sun, overdose of solar radiation and the extremes of heat, cold, and pressure while the planet was being made, that formed that particular kind of crystal here. I guess that's why they're called sun-stones."</p>
    <p>He shook his head. "So that's how they work it—direct mental communication between the Korins and the hawks, by means of the stones. Simple, too. Set them right in the skull, almost in contact with the brain, and you don't need all the complicated machines and senders and receivers they've been monkeying with in the labs for so long." He shivered. "I'll admit I don't like the idea, though. There's something repulsive about it."</p>
    <p>Hugh said bitterly, "When they were only men, and convicts, we might have beaten them some day, even though they had all the weapons. But when they became the Korins—" He indicated the darkling alcoves of the cave. "This is the only freedom we can ever have now."</p>
    <p>Looking at Hugh and Jen, Trevor felt a great welling-up of pity, for them, and for all these far-removed children of Earth who were now only hunted slaves to whom this burrow in the rock meant freedom. He thought with pure hatred of the Korins who hunted them, with the uncanny hawks that were their far-ranging eyes and ears and weapons. He wished he could hit them with . . .</p>
    <p>He caught himself up sharply. Letting his sympathies run away with him wasn't going to do anybody any good. The only thing that concerned him was to get hold of that sun-stone again and get out of this devil's pocket. He'd spent half a life hunting for a stone, and he wasn't going to let concern over perfect strangers sidetrack him now.</p>
    <p>The first step would be getting away from the cave.</p>
    <p>It would have to be at night. No watch was kept then on the ledges, for the hawks did not fly in darkness, and the Korins never moved without the hawks. Most of the people were busy in those brief hours of safety. The women searched for edible moss and lichens. Some of the men brought water from the stream at the canyon fork, and others, with stone clubs and crude spears, hunted the great rock-lizards that slept in the crevices, made sluggish by the cold.</p>
    <p>Trevor waited until the fourth night, and then when Saul's water party left, he started casually out of the cave after them.</p>
    <p>"I think I'll go down with them," he told Jen and Hugh. "I haven't been down that far since I got here."</p>
    <p>There seemed to be no suspicion in them of his purpose. Jen said, "Stay close to the others. It's easy to get lost in the rocks."</p>
    <p>He turned and went into the darkness after the water party. He followed them down to the fork, and it was quite easy then to slip aside among the tumbled rock and leave them, working his way slowly and silently downstream.</p>
    <p>After several days in the dimness of the cave, he found that the star-shine gave him light enough to move by. It was hard going, even so, and by the time he reached the approximate place where Saul had tried to kill him he was bruised and cut and considerably shaken. But he picked his spot carefully, crossed the stream, and began to search.</p>
    <p>The chill deepened. The rocks that had been hot under his hands turned cold, and the frost-rime settled lightly on them, and Trevor shivered and swore and scrambled, fighting the numbness out of his body, praying that none of the loose rubble would fall on him and crush him. He had prospected on Mercury for a long time. Otherwise he would not have lived.</p>
    <p>He found it more easily than he could have done by day, without a detector. He saw the cold pale light of it gleaming, down among the dark broken rock where Saul had thrown it.</p>
    <p>He picked it up.</p>
    <p>He dandled the thing in his palm, touching it with loving finger tips. It had a certain cold repellent beauty, glimmering in the darkness—a freakish by-product of Mercury's birth-pangs, unique in the solar system. Its radioactivity was a type and potency harmless to living tissue, and its wonderful sensitivity had made it possible for physicists to explore at least a little into those unknown regions above the first octave.</p>
    <p>In a gesture motivated by pure curiosity he lifted the stone and pressed it tight against the flesh between his brows. Probably it wouldn't work this way. Probably it had to be set deep into the bone . . .</p>
    <p>It worked, oh God, it worked, and something had him, something caught him by the naked brain and would not let him go.</p>
    <p>Trevor screamed. The thin small sound was lost in the empty dark, and he tried again, but no sound would come. Something had forbidden him to scream. Something was in there, opening out the leaves of his brain like the pages of a child's book, and it wasn't a hawk, or a Korin. It wasn't anything human or animal that he had ever known before. It was something still and lonely and remote, as alien as the mountain peaks that towered upward to the stars, and as strong, and as utterly without mercy.</p>
    <p>Trevor's body became convulsed. Every physical instinct was driving him to run, to escape, and he could not. In his throat now there was a queer wailing whimper. He tried to drop the sun-stone. He was forbidden. Rage began to come on the heels of horror, a blind protest against the indecent invasion of his most private mind. The whimpering rose to a sort of catlike squall, an eerie and quite insane sound in the narrow gorge, and he clawed with his free hand at the one that held the sun-stone, tight against his brows.</p>
    <p>He tore it loose.</p>
    <p>A wrench that almost cracked his brain in two. A flicker of surprise, just before the contact broke, and then a fading flash of anger, and then nothing.</p>
    <p>Trevor fell down. He did not quite lose consciousness, but there was an ugly sickness in him and all his bones had turned to water. It seemed a long time before he could get to his feet again. Then he stood there shaking.</p>
    <p>There was something in this accursed valley. There was something or someone who could reach out through the sun-stones and take hold of a man's mind. It did that to the Korins and the hawks, and it had done it for a moment to him, and the horror of that alien grasp upon his brain was still screaming inside him.</p>
    <p>"But who—?" he whispered hoarsely. And then he knew that the word was wrong. "What—?"</p>
    <p>For it was not human, it couldn't be human, whatever had held him there wasn't man or woman, brute or human. It was something else, but what it was he didn't want to know, he only wanted to get out—out—</p>
    <p>Trevor found that he had begun to run, bruising his shins against rocks. He got a grip on himself, forcing himself to stand still. His breath was coming in great gasps.</p>
    <p>He still had the sun-stone clenched in his sweating palm, and he had an almost irresistible desire to fling the thing away with all his strength. But even in the grip of alien horror a man could not throw away the goal of half a lifetime, and he held it, and hated it.</p>
    <p>He told himself that whatever it was that reached through the sun-stones could not use them unless they were against the forehead, close to the brain. The thing couldn't harm him if he kept it away from his head.</p>
    <p>A terrible thought renewed Trevor's horror. He thought of the Korins, the men who wore sun-stones set forever in their brows. Were they, always and always, in the icy, alien grip of that which had held him? And these were the masters of Jen's people?</p>
    <p>He forced that thought away. He had to forget everything except how to get free of this place.</p>
    <p>He started at once, still shaken. He couldn't go far before daylight, and he would have to lie up in the rocks through the day and try to make it to the valley wall the next night.</p>
    <p>He was glad when daylight came, the first fires of sunrise kindling the peaks that went above the sky.</p>
    <p>It was at that moment that a shadow flickered, and Trevor looked up and saw the hawks.</p>
    <p>Many hawks. They had not seen him, they were not heeding the rocks in which he crouched. They were flying straight up the ravine, not circling or searching now but going with a sure purpose-fullness, back the way he had come.</p>
    <p>He watched them uneasily. There were more than he had ever seen together before. But they flew on up the ravine without turning, and were gone.</p>
    <p>"They weren't looking for me," he thought. "But . . ."</p>
    <p>Trevor should have felt relieved, but he didn't. His uneasiness grew and grew, stemming from an inescapable conclusion.</p>
    <p>The hawks were going to the cave. They were heading toward it in an exact line, turning neither to right nor left, and this time they were not in any doubt. They, or whoever or whatever dominated them, knew this time exactly where to find the fugitives.</p>
    <p>"But that's impossible," Trevor tried to tell himself. "There's no way they could suddenly learn exactly where the cave is after all this time."</p>
    <p>No way?</p>
    <p>A thing was forcing its way up into Trevor's anxious thoughts, a realization that he did not want to look at squarely, not at all. But it would not be put down, it would not stop tormenting him, and suddenly he cried out to it, a cry of pain and guilt, "No, it couldn't be! It couldn't be through me they learned!" It fronted him relentlessly, the memory of that awful moment in the canyon when whatever had gripped him through the sun-stone had seemed to be turning over the leaves of his brain like the pages of a book.</p>
    <p>The vast and alien mind that had gripped his in that dreadful contact had read his own brain clearly, he knew. And in Trevor's brain and memories it had found the secret of the cave. Trevor groaned in an agony of guilt.</p>
    <p>He crawled out of his rock-heap and began to run back up the ravine, following the path the hawks had taken. There might still be time to warn them.</p>
    <p>Stumbling, running, he passed the canyon fork. And now from above him in the canyon he heard the sounds he dreaded—the sounds of women screaming and men shouting hoarsely in fury and despair. Farther on, over the rocks, scrambling, slipping, gasping for breath, he came to the cave-mouth and the sight he had dreaded.</p>
    <p>The hawks had gone into the cave and driven out the slaves. They had them in the canyon now, and they were trying to herd them together and drive them down toward the lava beds. But the slaves were fighting back.</p>
    <p>Dark wings beat and thundered in the narrow gorge between the walls of rock. Claws struck and lashing tails cut like whips. Men struggled and floundered and trampled each other. Some died. Some of the hawks died too. But the people were being forced farther down the canyon under the relentless swooping of the hawks. Then Trevor saw Jen. She was a little way from the others. Hugh was with her. He had shoved her into a protecting hollow and was standing over her with a piece of rock in his hands, trying to beat off a hawk. Hugh was hurt badly. He was not doing well.</p>
    <p>Trevor uttered a wild cry that voiced all the futile rage in him, and bounded over a slope toward them.</p>
    <p>"Hugh, look out!" he yelled. The hawk had risen, and then had checked and turned, to swoop down straight at Hugh's back.</p>
    <p>Hugh swung partly around, but not soon enough. The hawk's claws were in his body, deep. Hugh fell down.</p>
    <p>Jen was screaming when Trevor reached them. He didn't stop to snatch up a rock. He threw himself onto the hawk that had welded itself to Hugh's back. There was a horrid slippery thrashing of wings under him, and the scaly neck of the thing was terribly strong between Trevor's hands. But not strong enough. He broke it.</p>
    <p>It was too late. When his sight cleared, Jen was staring in a strange wild way at the man and hawk lying tangled together in the dust. When Trevor touched her she fought him a little, not as though she saw him really, not as though she saw anything but Hugh's white ribs sticking out.</p>
    <p>"Jen, for God's sake, he's dead." Trevor tried to pull her away. "We've got to get away from here."</p>
    <p>There might be a chance. The black hawks were driving the humans down the canyon a little below them now, and if they could make the tumbled rocks below the cliff, there was a chance.</p>

    <p>He had to drag Jen. Her face had gone utterly blank.</p>
    <p>In the next minute he realized that they would never reach the rocks, and that there was no chance, none at all. Back from the winged whirl that was driving the humans, two of the hawks came darting at them.</p>
    <p>Trevor swung Jen behind him and hoped fiercely that he could get another neck between his hands before they pulled him down.</p>
    <p>The dark shadows flashed down. He could see the sun-stones glittering in their heads. They struck straight at him . . .</p>
    <p>But at the last split second they swerved away.</p>
    <p>Trevor waited. They came back again, very fast, but this time it was at Jen they struck, and not at him.</p>
    <p>He got her behind him again in time. And once more the hawks checked their strike.</p>
    <p>The truth dawned on Trevor. The hawks were deliberately refraining from hurting him.</p>
    <p>"Whoever gives them their orders, the Korins or that Other, doesn't want me hurt!"</p>
    <p>He caught up Jen in his arms and started to run again toward the rocks.</p>
    <p>Instantly the hawks struck at Jen. He could not swing her clear in time. Blood ran from the long claw-marks they left in her smooth, tanned shoulders.</p>
    <p>Jen cried out. Trevor hesitated. He tried again for the rocks, and Jen moaned as a swift scaly head snapped at her neck.</p>
    <p>So that's it, Trevor thought furiously. I'm not to be hurt, but they can drive me through Jen.</p>
    <p>And they could, too. He would never get Jen to the concealment of the rocks alive, with those two wide-winged shadows tearing at her. He had to go the way they wanted or they would leave her as they had left Hugh.</p>
    <p>"All right!" Trevor yelled savagely at the circling demons. "Let her alone! I'll go where you want."</p>
    <p>He turned, still carrying Jen, plodding after the other slaves who were being herded down the canyon.</p>
    <p>All that day the black hawks drove the humans down the watercourse, around the shoulder of basalt and out onto the naked sun-seared lava bed. Some of them dropped and lay where they were, and no effort of the hawks could move them on again. Much of the time Trevor carried Jen. Part of the time he dragged her. For long vague periods he had no idea what he did.</p>
    <p>He was in a daze in which only his hatred still was vivid, when he felt Jen pulled away from him. He struggled, and was held—and he looked up to see a ring of mounted men around him. Korins on their crested beasts, the sun-stones glittering in their brows.</p>
    <p>They looked down at Trevor, curious, speculative, hostile, their otherwise undistinguished human faces made strangely evil and other-worldly by the winking stones.</p>
    <p>"You come with us to the city," one of them said curtly to Trevor. "That woman goes with the other slaves."</p>
    <p>Trevor glared up at him. "Why me, to the city?"</p>
    <p>The Korin raised his riding whip threateningly. "Do as you're ordered! Mount!"</p>
    <p>Trevor saw that a slave had brought a saddled beast to him and was holding it, not looking either at him or the Korins.</p>
    <p>"All right," he said. "I'll go with you."</p>
    <p>He mounted and sat waiting, his eyes bright with the hatred that burned in him, bright as blown coals. They formed a circle around him and the leader gave a word. They galloped off toward the distant city.</p>
    <p>Trevor must have dozed as he rode, for suddenly it was sunset, and they were approaching the city.</p>
    <p>Seeing it as he had before, far off and with nothing to measure it against but the overtopping titan peaks, it had seemed no more than a city built of rock. Now he was close to it. Black shadows lay on it, and on the valley, but half way up the opposite mountain wall the light still blazed, reflected downward on the shallow sky, so that everything seemed to float in some curious dimension between night and day. Trevor stared, shut his eyes, and stared again.</p>
    <p>The size was wrong.</p>
    <p>He looked quickly at the Korins, with the eerie feeling that he might have shrunk to child-size as he slept. But they had not changed—at least, relative to himself. He turned back to the city, trying to force it into perspective.</p>
    <p>It rose up starkly from the level plain. There was no gradual guttering out into suburbs, no softening down to garden villas or rows of cottages. It leaped up like a cliff and began, solemn, massive, squat, and ugly. The buildings were square, set stiffly along a square front. They were not tall. Most of them were only one story high. And yet Trevor felt dwarfed by them, as he had never felt dwarfed by the mightiest of Earth's skyscrapers. It was an unnatural feeling, and one that made him curiously afraid.</p>
    <p>There were no walls or gateways, no roads leading in. One minute the beasts padded on the grass of the open plain. The next, their claws were clicking on a stone pave and the buildings closed them in, hulking, graceless, looking sullen and forlorn in the shadowed light. There was no sound in them anywhere, no gleaming of lamps in the black embrasures of cavernous doors. The last furious glare of the hidden sun seeped down from the high peaks and stained their upper walls, and they were old—half as old, Trevor thought, as the peaks themselves.</p>
    <p>It was the window embrasures, the doors, and the steps that led up to them that made Trevor understand suddenly what was wrong. And the latent fear that had been in him sprang to full growth. The city, and the buildings in it, the steps and the doors and the height of the windows, were perfectly in proportion, perfectly normal—if the people who lived there were twenty feet high.</p>
    <p>He turned to the Korins. "You never built this place. Who built it?"</p>
    <p>The one called Galt, who was nearest him, snarled, "Quiet, slave!"</p>
    <p>Trevor looked at him, and at the other Korins. Something about their faces and the way they rode along the darkening empty street told him they too were afraid.</p>
    <p>He said, "You, the Korins, the lordly demigods who ride about and send your hawks to hunt and slay—you're more afraid of your master than the slaves are of you!"</p>
    <p>They turned toward him pallid faces that burned with hatred.</p>
    <p>He remembered how that other had gripped his brain back in the canyon. He remembered how it had felt. He understood many things now.</p>
    <p>He asked, "How does it feel to be enslaved, Korins? Not just enslaved in body, but in mind and soul?"</p>
    <p>Galt turned like a striking snake. But the blow never fell. The upraised hand with the heavy whip suddenly checked, and then sank down again. Only the eyes of the Korin glowed with a baleful helplessness under the winking sun-stone.</p>
    <p>Trevor laughed without humor. "It wants me alive. I guess I'm safe, then. I guess I could tell you what I think of you. You're still convicts, aren't you? After three hundred years. No wonder you hate the slaves."</p>
    <p>Not the same convicts, of course. The sun-stones didn't give longevity. Trevor knew how the Korins propagated, stealing women from among the slaves, keeping the male children and killing the female. He laughed again.</p>
    <p>"It isn't such a good life after all, is it, being a Korin? Even hunting and killing can't take the taste out of your mouths. No wonder you hate the others! They're enslaved, all right, but they're not owned."</p>
    <p>They would have liked to kill him but they could not. They were forbidden. Trevor looked at them, in the last pale flicker of the afterglow. The jewels and the splendid harness, the bridles of the beasts heavy with gold, the weapons—they looked foolish now, like the paper crowns and glass beads that children deck themselves with when they pretend to be kings. These were not lords and masters. These were only little men, and slaves. And the sun-stones were a badge of shame.</p>
    <p>The cavalcade passed on. Empty streets, empty houses with windows too high for human eyes to look through and steps too tall for human legs to climb. Full dark, and the first stunning crash of thunder, the first blaze of lightning between the cliffs. The mounts were hurrying now, almost galloping to beat the lightning and the scalding rain.</p>
    <p>They were in a great square. Around it was a stiff rectangle of houses, and these were lighted with torchlight, and in the monstrous doorways here and there a little figure stood, a Korin, watching.</p>
    <p>In the exact center of the square was a flat low structure of stone, having no windows and but a single door.</p>
    <p>They reined the beasts before that lightless entrance. "Get down," said Galt to Trevor. A livid reddish flaring in the sky showed Trevor the Korin's face, and it was smiling, as a wolf smiles before the kill. Then the thunder came, the downpour of rain, and he was thrust bodily into the doorway.</p>
    <p>He stumbled over worn flagging in the utter dark, but the Korins moved sure-footedly as cats. He knew they had been here many times before, and he knew that they hated it. He could feel the hate and the fear bristling out from the bodies that were close to his, smell them in the close hot air. They didn't want to be here but they had to. They were bidden.</p>
    <p>He would have fallen head-foremost down the sudden flight of steps if someone had not caught his arm. They were huge steps. They were forced to go down them as small children do, lowering themselves bodily from tread to tread. A furnace blast of air came up the well, but in spite of the heat Trevor felt cold. He could feel how the hard stone of the stairs had been worn into deep hollows by the passing of feet. Whose feet? And going where?</p>
    <p>A sulphurous glow began to creep up through the darkness. They went down what seemed a very long way. The glow brightened, so that Trevor could once more make out the faces of the Korins. The heat was overpowering, but still there was a coldness around Trevor's heart.</p>
    <p>The steps ended in a long low hall, so long that the farther end of it was lost in vaporous shadow. Trevor thought that it must have been squared out of a natural cavern, for here and there in the rocky floor small fumaroles burned and bubbled, giving off the murky light and a reek of brimstone.</p>
    <p>Along both sides of the hall were rows of statues seated in stone chairs.</p>
    <p>Trevor stared at them, with the skin crawling up and down his back. Statues of men and women—or rather, of creatures manlike and womanlike—sitting solemn and naked, their hands folded in their laps, their eyes, fashioned of dull, reddish stone, looking straight ahead, their features even and composed, with a strange sad patience clinging to the stony furrows around mouth and cheek. Statues that would be perhaps twenty feet tall if they were standing, carved by a master's chisel out of a pale substance that looked like alabaster.</p>
    <p>Galt caught his arm. "Oh, no, you won't run away. You were laughing, remember? Come on, I want to see you laugh some more."</p>
    <p>They forced him along between the rows of statues. Quiet statues, with a curiously ghostly look of thoughtfulness—of thoughts and feelings long vanished but once there, different from those of humans, perhaps, but quite as strong. No two of them were alike, in face or body. Trevor noted among them things seldom seen in statues, a maimed limb, a deformity, or a completely nondescript face that would offer neither beauty nor ugliness for an artist to enlarge upon. Also, they seemed all to be old, though he could not have said why he thought so.</p>
    <p>There were other halls opening off this main one. How far they went he had no means of guessing, but he could see that in them were other shadowy rows of seated figures.</p>
    <p>Statues. Endless numbers of statues, down here in the darkness underneath the city . . .</p>
    <p>He stopped, bracing himself against his captors, gripping the hot rock with his bare feet.</p>
    <p>"This is a catacomb," he said. "Those aren't statues, they're bodies, dead things sitting up,"</p>
    <p>"Come on," said Galt. "Come on, and laugh!"</p>
    <p>They took him, and there were too many to fight. And Trevor knew that it was not them he had to fight. Something was waiting for him down in that catacomb. It had had his mind once. It would—</p>
    <p>They were approaching the end of the long hall. The sickly light from the fumaroles showed the last of the lines of seated figures-had they died there like that, sitting up, or had they been brought here afterward? The rows on each side ended evenly, the last chairs exactly opposite each other.</p>
    <p>But against the blank end wall was a solitary seat of stone, facing down the full gloomy length of the hall, and on it sat a manlike shape of alabaster, very still, the stony hands folded rigidly upon the stony thighs. A figure no different from the others, except . . . .</p>
    <p>Except that the eyes were still alive.</p>
    <p>The Korins dropped back a little. All but Galt. He stayed beside Trevor, his head bent, his mouth sullen and nervous, not looking up at all. And Trevor stared into the remote and somber eyes that were like two pieces of carnelian in that pale alabaster face, and yet were living, sentient, full of a deep and alien sorrow.</p>
    <p>It was very silent in the catacomb. The dreadful eyes studied Trevor, and for just a moment his hatred was tempered by a strange pity as he thought what it must be like for the brain, the intelligence behind those eyes, already entombed, and knowing it.</p>
    <p>"A long living and a long dying. The blessing and the curse of my people."</p>
    <p>The words were soundless, spoken inside his brain. Trevor started violently. Almost he turned to flee, remembering the torture of that moment in the canyon, and then he found that while he had been staring, a force as gentle and stealthy as the gliding of a shadow had already invaded him. And he was forbidden.</p>
    <p>"At this range I do not need the sun-stones," murmured the silent voice within him. "Once I did not need them at all. But I am old."</p>
    <p>Trevor stared at the stony thing that watched him, and then he thought of Jen, of Hugh lying dead with a dead hawk in the dust, and the strangeness left him, and his bitter passion flared again.</p>
    <p>"So you hate me as well as fear me, little human? You would destroy me?" There was a gentle laughter inside Trevor's mind. "I have watched generations of humans die so swiftly. And yet I am here, as I was before they came, waiting."</p>
    <p>"You won't be here forever," snarled Trevor. "These others like you died. You will!"</p>
    <p>"Yes. But it is a slow dying, little human. Your body chemistry is like that of the plants, the beasts, based upon carbon. Quick to grow. Quick to wither away. Ours was of another sort. We were like the mountains, cousin to them, our body cells built of silicon, even as theirs. And so our flesh endures until it grows slow and stiff with age. But even then we must wait long, very long, for death."</p>
    <p>Something of the truth of that long waiting came to Trevor, and he felt a shuddering thankfulness for the frailty of human flesh.</p>
    <p>"I am the last," whispered the silent voice. "For a while I had companionship of minds, but the others are all gone before me, long ago."</p>
    <p>Trevor had a nightmare vision of Mercury, in some incalculable future eon, a frozen world taking its last plunge into the burned-out sun, bearing with it these endless rows of alabaster shapes, sitting in their chairs of stone, upright in the dead blackness underneath the ice.</p>
    <p>He fought back to reality, clutching his hatred as a swimmer clings to a plank, his voice raw with passion and bitterness as he cried out.</p>
    <p>"Yes, I'll destroy you if I can! What else could you expect after what you've done?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, no, little human, you will not destroy me. You will help me."</p>
    <p>Trevor glared. "Help you? Not if you kill me!"</p>
    <p>"There will be no killing. You would be of no use to me dead. But alive you can serve me. That is why you were spared."</p>
    <p>"Serve you—like them?" He swung to point to the waiting Korins, but the Korins were not waiting now, they were closing in on him, their hands reaching for him.</p>
    <p>Trevor struck out at them. He had a fleeting thought of how weird this battle of his with the Korins must look, as they struck and staggered on the stone paving beneath the looming, watching thing of stone.</p>
    <p>But even as he had that thought, the moment of struggle ended. An imperious command hit his brain, and black oblivion closed down upon him like the sudden clenching of a fist.</p>

    <p>Darkness. He was lost in it, and he was not himself any more. He fled through the darkness, groping, crying out for something that was gone. And a voice answered him, a voice that he did not want to hear . . . .</p>
    <p>Darkness. Dreams.</p>
    <p>Dawn, high on the blazing mountains. He stood in the city, watching the light grow bright and pitiless, watching it burn on the upper walls and then slip downward into the streets, casting heavy shadows in the openings of door and window, so that the houses looked like skulls with empty eyeholes and gaping mouths. The buildings no longer seemed too big. He walked between them, and when he came to steps he climbed them easily, and the window ledges were no higher than his head. He knew these buildings. He looked at each one as he passed, naming it, remembering with a long, long memory.</p>
    <p>The hawks came down to him, the faithful servants with the sun-stones in their brows. He stroked their pliant necks, and they hissed softly with pleasure, but their shallow minds were empty of everything but that vague sensation. He passed on through the familiar streets, and in them nothing stirred. All through the day from dawn to sunset, and in the darkness that came afterward, nothing stirred, and there was a silence among the stones.</p>
    <p>He could not endure the city. His time was not yet, though the first subtle signs of age had touched him. But he went down into the catacombs and took his place with those others who were waiting and could still speak to him with their minds, so that he should not be quite alone with the silence.</p>
    <p>The years went by, leaving no traces of themselves in the unchanging gloom of the mortuary halls.</p>
    <p>One by one those last few minds were stilled until all were gone. And by that time age had chained him where he was, unable to rise and go again into the city where he had been young, the youngest of all . . . Shannach, they had named him—The Last.</p>
    <p>So he waited, alone. And only one who was kin to the mountains could have borne that waiting in the place of the dead.</p>
    <p>Then, in a burst of flame and thunder, new life came into the valley. Human life. Soft, frail, receptive life, intelligent, unprotected, possessed of violent and bewildering passions. Very carefully, taking its time, the mind of Shannach reached out and gathered them in.</p>
    <p>Some of the men were more violent than the others. Shannach saw their emotions in patterns of scarlet against the dark of his inner mind. They had already made themselves masters, and a number of these frail sensitive brains had snapped out swiftly because of them. "These I will take for my own," thought Shannach. "Their mind-patterns are crude, but strong, and I am interested in death."</p>
    <p>There had been a surgeon aboard the ship but he was dead. However, there was no need of a surgeon for what was about to be done. When Shannach had finished talking to the men he had chosen, telling them of the sun-stones, telling them the truth, but not all of it—when those men had eagerly agreed to the promise of power—Shannach took complete control. And the clumsy convict hands that moved now with such exquisite skill were as much his instruments as the scalpels of the dead surgeon that they wielded, making the round incision and the delicate cutting of the bone.</p>
    <p>Who was the man that lay there, quiet under the knife? Who were the ones that bent above him, with the strange stones in their brows? Names. There are names and I know them. Closer, closer. I know that man who lies there with blood between his eyes . . .</p>
    <p>Trevor screamed. Someone slapped him across the face, viciously and with intent. He screamed again, fighting, clawing, still blinded by the visions and the dark mists, and that voice that he dreaded so much spoke gently in his mind, "It's all over, Trevor. It is done."</p>
    <p>The hard hand slapped him again, and a rough human voice said harshly, "Wake up. Wake up, damn it!"</p>
    <p>He woke. He was in the middle of a vast room, crouched down in the attitude of a fighter, shivering, sweating, his hands outstretched and grasping nothing. He must have sprung there, half unconscious, from the tumbled pallet of skins against the wall. Galt was watching him.</p>
    <p>"Welcome, Earthman. How does it feel to be one of the masters?"</p>
    <p>Trevor stared at him. A burning flood of light fell in through the tall windows so high above his head, setting the sun-stone ablaze between the Korin's sullen brows. Trevor's gaze fixed on that single point of brilliance.</p>
    <p>"Oh, yes," said Galt. "It's true."</p>
    <p>It struck Trevor with an ugly shock that Galt's lips had not moved, and that he had made no audible sound.</p>
    <p>"The stones give us a limited ability," Galt went on, still without speaking aloud. "Not like His, of course. But we can control the hawks, and exchange ideas between us when we want to if the range isn't too far. Naturally, our minds are open to Him any time he wants to pry."</p>
    <p>"There's no pain," Trevor whispered, desperately trying to make the thing not be so. "My head doesn't ache."</p>
    <p>"Of course not. He takes care of that."</p>
    <p>Shannach? If it isn't so, how do I know that name? And that dream, that endless nightmare in the catacombs.</p>
    <p>Galt winced. "We don't use that name. He doesn't like it." He looked at Trevor. "What's the matter, Earthman? Why so green? You were laughing once, remember? Where's your sense of humor now?"</p>
    <p>He caught Trevor abruptly by the shoulders and turned him around so that he faced a great sheet of polished glassy substance set into the wall. A mirror for giants, reflecting the whole huge room, reflecting the small dwarfed figures of the men.</p>
    <p>"Go on," said Galt, pushing Trevor ahead of him. "Take a look."</p>
    <p>Trevor shook off the Korin's grasp. He moved forward by himself, close to the mirror. He set his hands against the chill surface and stared at what he saw there. And it was true.</p>
    <p>Between his brows a sun-stone winked and glittered. And his face, the familiar, normal, not-too-bad face he had been used to all his life, was transformed into something monstrous and unnatural, a goblin mask with a third, and evil eye.</p>
    <p>A coldness crept into his heart and bones. He backed away a little from the mirror, his hands moving blindly upward, slowly toward the stone that glistened between his brows. His mouth was twisted like a child's, and two tears rolled down his cheeks.</p>
    <p>His fingers touched the stone. And then the anger came. He sank his nails into his forehead, clawing at the hard stone, not caring if he died after he had torn it out.</p>
    <p>Galt watched him. His lips smiled but his eyes were hateful.</p>
    <p>Blood ran down the sides of Trevor's nose. The sun-stone was still there. He moaned and thrust his nails in deeper, and Shannach let him go until he had produced one stab of agony that cut his head in two and nearly dropped him. Then Shannach sent in the full force of his mind. Not in anger, for he felt none, and not in cruelty, for he was no more cruel than the mountain he was kin to, but simply because it was necessary.</p>
    <p>Trevor felt that cold and lonely power roll down on him like an avalanche. He braced himself to meet it, but it broke his defenses, crushed them, made them nothing, and moved onward against the inmost citadel of his mind.</p>
    <p>In that reeling, darkened fortress all that was wholly Trevor crouched and clung to its armament of rage, remembering dimly that once, in a narrow canyon, it had driven back this enemy and broken free. And then some crude animal instinct far below the level of conscious thought warned him not to press the battle now, to bury his small weapon and wait, letting his last redoubt of which he was yet master go untouched and perhaps unnoticed by his captor.</p>
    <p>Trevor let his hands drop limply and his mind go slack. The cold black tide of power paused, and then he felt it slide away, withdrawing from those threatened walls. Out of the edges of it, Shannach spoke.</p>
    <p>"Your mind is tougher than these valley-bred Korins. They're well conditioned, but you—you remember that you defied me once. The contact was imperfect then. It is not imperfect now. Remember that, too, Trevor."</p>
    <p>Trevor drew in a long, unsteady breath. He whispered, "What do you want of me?"</p>
    <p>"Go and see the ship. Your mind tells me that it understands these things. See if it can be made to fly again."</p>
    <p>That order took Trevor completely by surprise. "The ship! But why . . ?"</p>
    <p>Shannach was not used to having his wishes questioned, but he answered patiently, "I have still a while to live. Several of your short generations. I have had too much of this valley, too much of these catacombs. I want to leave them."</p>
    <p>Trevor could understand that. Having had that nightmare glimpse into Shannach's mind, he could perfectly understand. For one brief moment he was torn with pity for this trapped creature who was alone in the universe. And then he wondered, "What would you do if you could leave the valley? What would you do to another settlement of men?"</p>
    <p>"Who knows? I have one thing left to me—curiosity."</p>
    <p>"You'd take the Korins with you, and the hawks?"</p>
    <p>"Some. They are my eyes and ears, my hands and feet. But you object, Trevor."</p>
    <p>"What difference does that make?" said Trevor bitterly. "I'll go look at the ship."</p>
    <p>"Come on," said Galt, taking up an armful of torches. "I'll show you the way."</p>
    <p>They went out through the tall door into the streets between the huge square empty houses. The streets and houses that Trevor had known in his dream, remembering when there were lights and voices in them. Trevor noticed only that Galt was leading him out on the opposite side of the city, toward the part of the valley he had never visited. And then his mind reverted to something that not even the shock of his awakening could drive out of his consciousness. Jen.</p>
    <p>A sudden panic sprang up in him. How long had it been since the darkness fell on him there in the catacomb? Long enough for almost anything to happen. He envisioned Jen being torn by hawks, of her body lying dead as Hugh's had lain, and he started to reach out for Galt, who had owned them both. But abruptly Shannach spoke to him, in that eerie silent way he was getting used to. "The woman is safe. Here, look for yourself."</p>
    <p>His mind was taken firmly and directed into a channel completely new to him. He felt a curious small shock of contact, and suddenly he was looking down from a point somewhere in the sky at a walled paddock with a number of tiny figures in it. His own eyes would have seen them as just that, but the eyes he was using now were keen as an eagle's, though they saw no color but only black and white and the shadings in between. So he recognized one of the distant figures as Jen.</p>
    <p>He wanted to get closer to her, much closer, and rather sulkily his point of vision began to circle down dropping lower and lower. Jen looked up. He saw the shadow of wide wings sweep across her and realized that of course he was using one of the hawks. He pulled it back so as not to frighten her, but not before he had seen her face. The frozen stoniness was gone, and in its place had come the look of a wounded tigress.</p>
    <p>"I want her," Trevor said to Shannach.</p>
    <p>"She belongs to Galt. I do not interfere."</p>
    <p>Galt shrugged. "You're welcome. But keep her chained. She's too dangerous now for anything but hawk-meat."</p>
    <p>The ship was not far beyond the city. It lay canted over on its side, just clear of a low spur jutting out from the barrier cliff. It had hit hard, and some of the main plates were buckled, but from the outside the damage did not seem irreparable, if you had the knowledge and the tools to work with. Three hundred years ago it might have been made to fly again, only those who had the knowledge and the will were dead. And the convicts wanted to stay where they were.</p>
    <p>The tough metal of the outer skin, alloyed to resist friction that could burn up a meteor, had stood up pretty well under three centuries of Mercurian climate. It was corroded, and where the breaks were the inner shells were eaten through with rust, but the hulk still retained the semblance of a ship.</p>
    <p>"Will it fly?" asked Shannach eagerly.</p>
    <p>"I don't know yet," Trevor answered.</p>
    <p>Galt lighted a torch and gave it to him. "I'll stay out here."</p>
    <p>Trevor laughed. "How are you ever going to fly over the mountains?"</p>
    <p>"He'll see to that when the time comes," Galt muttered. "Take the rest of these torches. It's dark in there."</p>
    <p>Trevor climbed in through the gaping lock, moving with great caution on the tilted, rust-red decks. Inside, the ship was a shambles. Everything had been stripped out of it that could be used, leaving only bare cubicles with the enamel peeling off the walls and a moldering litter of junk.</p>
    <p>In a locker forward of the air lock he found a number of space-suits. The fabric was rotted away, but a few of the helmets were still good and some half score of the oxygen bottles had survived, the gas still in them.</p>
    <p>Shannach urged him on impatiently. "Get to the essentials, Trevor!"</p>
    <p>The bridge room was still intact, though the multiple thickness of glassite in the big ports showed patterns of spidery cracks. Trevor examined the controls. He was strictly a planetary spacer, used to flying his small craft within spitting distance of the world he was prospecting, and there were a few gadgets here he didn't understand, but he could figure the board well enough.</p>
    <p>"Not far, Trevor. Only over the mountains. I know from your mind—and I remember from the minds of those who died after the landing—that beyond the mountain wall there is a plain of dead rock, more than a hundred of your reckoning in miles, and then another ridge that seems solid but is not, and beyond that pass there is a fertile valley twenty times bigger than Korith, where Earthmen live."</p>
    <p>"Only partly fertile, and the mines that brought the Earthmen are pretty well worked out. But a few ships still land there, and a few Earthmen still hang on."</p>
    <p>"That is best. A small place, to begin . . ."</p>
    <p>"To begin what?"</p>
    <p>"Who can tell? You don't understand, Trevor. For centuries I have known exactly what I would do. There is a kind of rebirth in not knowing."</p>
    <p>Trevor shivered and went back to studying the controls. The wiring, protected by layers of imperviplast insulation and conduit, seemed to be in fair shape. The generator room below had been knocked about, but not too badly. There were spare batteries. Corroded, yes, but if they were charged, they could hold for a while.</p>
    <p>"Will it fly?"</p>
    <p>"I told you I don't know yet. It would take a lot of work."</p>
    <p>"There are many slaves to do this work."</p>
    <p>"Yes. But without fuel it's all useless."</p>
    <p>"See if there is fuel."</p>
    <p>The outlines of that hidden thing in Trevor's secret mind were coming clearer now. He didn't want to see them out in the full light where Shannach could see them too. He thought hard about generators, batteries, and the hooking up of leads.</p>
    <p>He crept among the dark bowels of the dead ship, working toward the stern. The torch made a red and smoky glare that lit up deserted wardrooms and plundered holds. One large compartment had a heavy barred and bolted door that had bent like tin in the crash. "That's where they came from," Trevor thought, "like wolves out of a trap."</p>
    <p>In the lower holds that had taken the worst of the impact were quantifies of mining equipment and farm machinery, all smashed beyond use but formidable looking none the less, with rusty blades and teeth and queer hulking shapes. They made him think of weapons, and he let the thought grow, adorning it with pictures of men going down under whirring reapers. Shannach caught it.</p>
    <p>"Weapons?"</p>
    <p>"They could be used as such. But the metal in them would repair the hull."</p>
    <p>He found the fuel bunkers. The main supply was used to the last grain of fissionable dust, but the emergency bunkers still showed some content on the mechanical gauges. Not much, but enough.</p>

    <p>A hard excitement began to stir in Trevor, too big to be hidden in that secret corner of his mind. He didn't try. He let it loose, and Shannach murmured.</p>
    <p>"You are pleased. The ship will fly, and you are thinking that when you reach that other valley and are among your own people again, you will find means to destroy me. Perhaps, but we shall see."</p>
    <p>In the smoky torchlight, looking down from a sagging catwalk above the firing chambers and the rusty sealed-in tubes, Trevor smiled. A lie could be thought as well as spoken. And Shannach, in a manner of speaking, was only human.</p>
    <p>"I'll need help. All the help there is."</p>
    <p>"You'll have it."</p>
    <p>"It'll take time. Don't hurry me and don't distract me. Remember, I want to get over the mountains as bad as you do."</p>
    <p>Shannach laughed.</p>
    <p>Trevor got more torches and went to work in the generator room. He felt that Shannach had withdrawn from him, occupied now with rounding up the Korins and the slaves. But he did not relax his caution. The open areas of his mind were filled with thoughts of vengeance to come when he reached that other valley.</p>
    <p>Gradually the exigencies of wrestling with antiquated and partly ruined machinery drove everything else away. That day passed, and a night, and half another day before all the leads were hooked the way he wanted them, before one creaky generator was operating on one-quarter normal output, and the best of the spare batteries were charging.</p>
    <p>He emerged from the torchlit obscurity into the bridge, blinking mole-like in the light, and found Galt sitting there.</p>
    <p>"He trusts you," the Korin said, "but not too far."</p>
    <p>Trevor scowled at him. Exhaustion, excitement, and a feeling of fate had combined to put him into an unreal state where his mind operated more or less independently. A hard protective shell had formed around that last little inner fortress so that it was hidden even from himself, and he had come almost to believe that he was going to fly this ship to another valley and battle Shannach there. So he was not surprised to hear Shannach say softly in his mind,</p>
    <p>"You might try to go away alone. I wouldn't want that, Trevor."</p>
    <p>Trevor grunted. "I thought you controlled me so well I couldn't spit if you forbade it."</p>
    <p>"I am dealing with much here that I don't comprehend. We were never a mechanical people. Therefore some of your thoughts, while I read them clearly, have no real meaning for me. I can handle you, Trevor, but I'm taking no chances with the ship."</p>
    <p>"Don't worry," Trevor told him. "I can't possibly take the ship up before the hull's repaired. It would fall apart on me." That was true, and he spoke it honestly.</p>
    <p>"Nevertheless," said Shannach, "Galt will be there, as my hands and feet, an extra guard over that object which you call a control-bank, and which your mind tells me is the key to the ship. You are forbidden to touch it until it is time to go."</p>
    <p>Trevor heard Shannach's silent laughter.</p>
    <p>"Treachery is implicit in your mind, Trevor. But I'll have time. Impulses come swiftly and cannot be read beforehand. But there is an interval between the impulse and the realization of it. Only a fraction of a second, perhaps, but I'll have time to stop you."</p>
    <p>Trevor did not argue. He was shaking a little with the effort of not giving up his last pitiful individuality, of fixing his thoughts firmly on the next step toward what Shannach wanted and looking neither to the right nor to the left of it. He ran a grimy hand over his face, shrinking from the touch of the alien disfigurement in his forehead, and said sullenly,</p>
    <p>"The holds have to be cleared. The ship won't lift that weight any more, and we need the metal for repairs." He thought again strongly of weapons. "Send the slaves."</p>
    <p>"No," said Shannach firmly. "The Korins will do that. We won't put any potential weapons in the hands of the slaves."</p>
    <p>Trevor allowed a wave of disappointment to cross his mind, and then he shrugged. "All right. But get them at it."</p>
    <p>He went and stood by the wide ports looking out over the plain toward the city. The slaves were gathered at a safe distance from the ship, waiting like a herd of cattle until they should be needed. Some mounted Korins guarded them while the hawks wheeled overhead.</p>
    <p>Coming toward the ship, moving with a resentful slowness, was a little army of Korins. Trevor could sense the group thought quite clearly. In all their lives they had never soiled their hands with labor, and they were angry that they had now to do the work of slaves.</p>
    <p>Digging his nails into his palms, Trevor went aft to show them what to do. He couldn't keep it hidden much longer, this thing that he had so painfully concealed under layers of half-truths and deceptions. It had to come out soon, and Shannach would know.</p>
    <p>In the smoky glare of many torches the Korins began to struggle with the rusting masses of machinery in the after holds.</p>
    <p>"Send more down here," Trevor said to Shannach. "These things are heavy."</p>
    <p>"They're all there now except those that guard the slaves. They cannot leave."</p>
    <p>"All right," said Trevor. "Make them work."</p>
    <p>He went back up along the canting decks, along the tilted passages, moving slowly at first, then swifter, swifter, his bare feet scraping on the flakes of rust, his face, with the third uncanny eye, gone white and strangely set. His mind was throwing off muddy streams of thought, confused and meaningless, desperate camouflage to hide until the last second what was underneath.</p>
    <p>"Trevor!"</p>
    <p>That was Shannach, alert, alarmed.</p>
    <p>It was coming now, the purpose, out into the light. It had to come, it could not be hidden any longer. It burst up from its secret place, one strong red flare against the darkness, and Shannach saw it, and sent the full cold power of his mind to drown it out.</p>
    <p>Trevor came into the bridge room, running.</p>
    <p>The first black wave of power hit him, crushed him. The bridge room lengthened out into some weird dimension of delirium, with Galt waiting at the far end. Behind Galt the one small, little key that needed to be touched just once.</p>
    <p>The towering might of Shannach beat him back, forbidding him to think, to move, to be. But down in that beleaguered part of Trevor's mind the walls still held, with the bright brand of determination burning in them.</p>
    <p>This was the moment, the time to fight. And he dug up that armament of fury he had buried there. He let it free, shouting at the alien force, "I beat you once! I beat you!"</p>
    <p>The deck swam under his feet. The peeling bulkheads wavered past like veils of mist. He didn't know whether he was moving or not, but he kept on while the enormous weight bore down on his quivering brain, a mountain tilting, falling, seeking to smother out the fury that was all he had to fight with.</p>
    <p>Fury for himself, defiled and outraged. Fury for Jen, with the red scars on her shoulders. Fury for Hugh lying dead under an obscene killer, fury for all the generations of decent people who had lived and died in slavery so that Shannach's time of waiting might be lightened.</p>
    <p>He saw Galt's face, curiously huge, close to his own. It was stricken and amazed. Trevor's bared teeth glistened.</p>
    <p>"I beat him once," he said to the Korin.</p>
    <p>Galt's hands were raised. There was a knife in his girdle, but he had been bidden not to use it, not to kill. Only Trevor could make the ship to fly. Galt reached out and took him but there was an un-sureness in his grip, and his mind was crying out to Shannach, "You could not make him stop! You could not!"</p>
    <p>Trevor, who was partly merged with Shannach now, heard that cry and laughed. Something in him had burst wide open at Galt's physical touch. He had no control now, no sane thought left, but only a wild intense desire to do two things, one of which was to destroy this monster that had hold of him.</p>
    <p>"Kill him," said Shannach suddenly. "He's mad, and no one can control an insane human."</p>
    <p>Galt did his best to obey. But Trevor's hands were already around the Korin's throat, the fingers sinking deep into the flesh. There was a sharp snapping of bone.</p>
    <p>He dropped the body. He could see nothing now except one tiny point of light in a reeling darkness. That single point of light had a red key in the center of it. Trevor reached out and pushed it down. That was the other thing.</p>
    <p>For a short second nothing happened. Trevor sagged down across Galt's body. Shannach was somewhere else, crying warnings that came too late. Trevor had time to draw one harsh triumphant breath and brace himself.</p>
    <p>The ship leaped under him. There was a dull roar, and then another, as the last fuel bunkers let go. The whole bridge room rolled and came to rest with a jarring shock that split the ports wide open, and the world was full of the shriek and crash of metal being torn and twisted and rent apart. Then it quieted. The ground stopped shaking and the deck settled under Trevor. There was silence.</p>
    <p>Trevor crawled up the new slope of the bridge room floor, to the shattered lock and through it, into the pitiless sunlight. He could see now exactly what he had done. And it was good. It had worked. That last small measure of fuel had been enough.</p>
    <p>The whole after part of the hulk was gone, and with it had gone all but a few of Shannach's Korins, trapped in the lower holds.</p>
    <p>And then, in pure surprise, Shannach spoke inside Trevor's mind. "I grow old indeed! I misjudged the toughness and the secrecy of a fresh, strong mind. I was too used to my obedient Korins."</p>
    <p>"Do you see what's happening to the last of them?" Trevor asked savagely. "Can you see?"</p>
    <p>The last of the Korins who had been outside with the slaves seemed to have been stunned and bewildered by the collapse of their world. And with the spontaneity of a whirlwind, the slaves had risen against this last remnant of their hated masters. They had waited for a long, long time, and now the Korins and the hawks were being done to death.</p>
    <p>"Can you see it, Shannach?"</p>
    <p>"I can see, Trevor. And—they're coming now for you!"</p>
    <p>They were. They were coming, blood-mad against all who wore the sun-stone, and Jen was in the forefront of them, and Saul, whose hands were red.</p>
    <p>Trevor knew that he had less than a half-minute to speak for his life. And he was aware that Shannach, still withdrawn, watched now with an edged amusement.</p>
    <p>Trevor said harshly to Saul and all of them, "So I give you your freedom, and you want to kill me for it?"</p>
    <p>Saul snarled, "You betrayed us in the cave, and now . . ."</p>
    <p>"I betrayed you, but without intent. There was someone stronger than the Korins, that even you didn't know about. So how should I have known?"</p>
    <p>Trevor talked fast, then, talking for his life, telling them about Shannach and how the Korins themselves were enslaved.</p>
    <p>"A lie," spat Saul.</p>
    <p>"Look for yourselves in the crypts underneath the city! But be careful."</p>
    <p>He looked at Jen, not at Saul. After a moment Jen said slowly, "Perhaps there is a Shannach. Perhaps that's why we were never allowed in the city, so the Korins could go on pretending that they were gods."</p>
    <p>"It's another of his lies, I tell you!"</p>
    <p>Jen turned to him. "Go and look, Saul. We'll watch him."</p>
    <p>Saul hesitated. Finally, he and a half-dozen others went off toward the city.</p>
    <p>Trevor sat down on the hot, scorched grass. He was very tired, and he didn't like at all the way the withdrawn shadow of Shannach hovered just outside his mind.</p>
    <p>The mountains leaned away from the Sun, and the shadows crawled up the lower slopes. Then Saul and the others returned.</p>
    <p>Trevor looked up at their faces and laughed without mirth. "It's true, isn't it?"</p>
    <p>"Yes," said Saul, and shivered. "Yes . . ."</p>
    <p>"Did he speak to you?"</p>
    <p>"He started to. But—we ran."</p>
    <p>And Saul suddenly cried, out of the depths of fear this time and not of hate, "We can never kill him. It's his valley. And oh God, we're trapped in here with him, we can't get out."</p>
    <p>"We can get out," said Trevor.</p>

    <p>Saul stared at him sickly. "There's no way over the mountains. There isn't even air up there."</p>
    <p>"There's a way. I found it in the ship."</p>
    <p>Trevor stood up, speaking with a sudden harshness. "Not a way for us all, not now, but if three or four of us go, one may live to make it. And he could bring back men with ships for the others."</p>
    <p>He looked at Saul. "Will you try it with me?"</p>
    <p>The gaunt man said hoarsely, "I still don't trust you, Trevor! But anything—anything, to get away from that . . ."</p>
    <p>"I'll go too," Jen said suddenly. "I'm as strong as Saul."</p>
    <p>That was true, and Trevor knew it. He stared at her for a long minute, but he could not read her face.</p>
    <p>Saul shrugged. "All right."</p>
    <p>"But it's all craziness," murmured a voice. "You can't breathe up there on the ridges. There's no air!"</p>
    <p>Trevor climbed painfully into what was left of the twisted wreck, and brought out the helmets and oxygen bottles that had survived for just this purpose.</p>
    <p>"We'll breathe," he said. "These-" He tried for a word that would explain to them, "—these containers hold an essence of air. We can take them with us and breathe."</p>
    <p>"But the cold?"</p>
    <p>"You have tanned skins, haven't you? And gums? I can show you how to make us protective garments. Unless you'd rather stay here with Shannach."</p>
    <p>Saul shivered a little. "No, we'll try it."</p>
    <p>In all the hours that followed—while the women of the slaves worked with soft tanned skins and resinous gums, while Trevor labored over the clumsy helmets they must have—in all that time, Shannach was silent.</p>
    <p>Silent, but not gone. Trevor felt that shadow on his mind, he knew that Shannach was watching. Yet the Last One made no attempt upon him.</p>
    <p>The slaves watched him, too. He saw the fear and hatred still in their eyes as they looked at the sun-stone between his brows.</p>
    <p>And Jen watched him, and said nothing, and he could read nothing at all in her face. Was she thinking of Hugh and how the hawks had come?</p>
    <p>By mid-afternoon they were ready. They started climbing slowly, toward the passes that went up beyond the sky. He and Saul and Jen were three grotesque and shapeless figures, in the three-layered garments of skin that were crudely sealed with gum, and the clumsy helmets that were padded out with cloth because there was no collar-rest to hold them. Their faces were wrapped close, and they held the ends of the oxygen tubes in their mouths because no amount of ingenuity could make the helmets space-tight.</p>
    <p>The evening shadow flowed upward from the valley floor as they climbed, and the men who had come to help them dropped back. These three went on, with Saul leading the way and Trevor last.</p>
    <p>And still Shannach had not spoken.</p>
    <p>The atmosphere slipped behind them. They were climbing into space now, tiny creatures clambering up an infinity of virgin rock, in the utter black between the blazing peaks above and the flaring lightning's of the evening storm below.</p>
    <p>Up and up toward the pass, toiling forward painfully with each other's help where no man could have made it alone, through a numbing and awful cold and silence. Three clumsy, dragging figures, up here above the sky itself, walking in the awfulness of infinity, where the rocks their feet dislodged rushed away as noiseless as a dream, where there was no sound, no light, no time.</p>
    <p>Trevor knew they must have reached the pass, for on both sides now there rose up slopes that had never been touched by wind or rain or living root. He staggered on, and presently the ground began to drop and the way was easier. They had passed the crest. And the oxygen was almost gone.</p>
    <p>Downward now, stumbling, slipping, sliding, yearning toward the air below. And they were on the other side of the mountain, above the plain of rock that led to . . .</p>
    <p>And then, at last, Shannach—laughed.</p>
    <p>"Clever," he said. "Oh, very clever, to escape without a ship! But you will come back, with a ship, and you will take me to the outside world. And I will reward you greatly."</p>
    <p>"No," said Trevor, in his mind. "No, Shannach. If we make it, the sun-stone comes out, and we'll come back for the slaves, not for you!"</p>
    <p>"No, Trevor." The gentle finality of that denial was coldly frightening. "You are mine now. You surprised and tricked me once, but I know the trick now. Your whole mind is open to me. You cannot withstand me ever again."</p>
    <p>It was cold, cold in the darkness below the pass, and the chill went deep into Trevor's soul and froze it.</p>
    <p>Saul and Jen were below him now, stumbling down along the rock-strewn lip of a chasm, into the thin high reaches of the air, into sound and life again. He saw them tear away their helmets. He followed them, pulling off his own, gasping the frigid breath into his starved lungs. Shannach said softly,</p>
    <p>"We do not need them any longer. They would be a danger when you reach other men. Dispose of them, Trevor."</p>
    <p>Trevor started a raging refusal, and then his mind was gripped as by a great hand, shaken and turned and changed. And his fury flowed away into blankness.</p>
    <p>But of course, he thought. There are many boulders, and I can topple them into the chasm so easily . . .</p>
    <p>He started toward a jagged stone mass, one that would quite neatly brush the two clumsy figures below him into the abyss.</p>
    <p>"That is the way, Trevor! But quickly—!"</p>
    <p>Trevor knew that Shannach had spoken truth, and that this time he was conquered.</p>
    <p>"No, I won't!" he cried to himself, but it was only a weak echo from a fading will-power, a dying self.</p>
    <p>"You will, Trevor! And now! They suspect."</p>
    <p>Saul and Jen had turned. Trevor's face, open now to the numbing cold which he could scarcely feel, must have told them everything. They started scrambling back up toward him. Only a short distance, but they would be too late.</p>
    <p>Trevor shrieked thinly, "Look out—Shannach . . . !"</p>
    <p>He had his hands on it now, on the boulder he must roll to crush them.</p>
    <p>But there was another way! He was Shannach's while he lived, but there was a way to avoid again betraying Jen's people, and that way was to live no longer.</p>
    <p>He used the last of his dying will to pitch himself toward the brink of the chasm. Hundreds of feet below a man could lie quiet on the rocks through all eternity.</p>
    <p>"Trevor, no! No!"</p>
    <p>Shannach's powerful command halted him as he swayed on the very edge. And then Jen's arms caught him from behind.</p>
    <p>He heard Saul's voice crying, thin and harsh in that upper air, "Push him over! He's a Korin. You saw his face!"</p>
    <p>Jen answered, "No! He tried to kill himself for us!"</p>
    <p>"But Shannach has him!" Saul cried out.</p>
    <p>Shannach had him, indeed, stamping down that final flicker of Trevor's revolt, fiercely commanding him.</p>
    <p>"Slay the woman and the man!"</p>
    <p>Trevor tried to. He was all Shannach's now. He tried earnestly and with all his strength to kill them, but both the woman and the man had hold of him now. They were too strong for him, and he could not obey the Last One as he wanted to.</p>
    <p>"Tie his arms!" Jen was shouting. "We can take him, and he can't do us any harm!"</p>
    <p>The anger of Shannach flooded through Trevor, and he raged and struggled, and it was useless. Strips of hide secured his arms and they were dragging him on down out of the mountains, and he could not obey. He could not!</p>
    <p>And then he felt the anger of Shannach ebb away into a terrible hopelessness. Trevor felt his own consciousness going, and he went into the darkness bearing in his mind the echo of that last bitter cry,</p>
    <p>"I am old—too old . . ."</p>

    <p>Trevor awakened slowly, rising above the dark sea of oblivion only to sink again, conscious in those brief intervals that he lay in a bed and that his head ached.</p>
    <p>There came a time when he rose, not to sink again. After a while his eyes opened, and he saw a metal ceiling.</p>
    <p>"We made it," he said.</p>
    <p>"Yes, you made it," said a friendly voice. "This is Solar City. You've been here quite a while."</p>
    <p>Trevor turned his head to the voice, to the white-jacketed doctor beside his bed. But he didn't see the man or the room. Not at first. He saw only, upon the bedside table in a tray, a tawny eye that winked and glittered at him.</p>
    <p>A sun-stone.</p>
    <p>His hand started to rise weakly to his face. The doctor forestalled him.</p>
    <p>"Don't bother. It's out. And a delicate job getting it out, it was. You'll have a headache for a while, but anyone would take a headache for a sun-stone!"</p>
    <p>Trevor didn't answer that. He said suddenly, "Jen—and Saul . . . ?"</p>
    <p>"They're here. Pretty odd folk they are, too. Won't talk to any of us. You're all a blazing mystery, you know."</p>
    <p>He went away. When he came back, Jen and Saul were with him. They wore modern synthecloth garments now. Jen looked as incongruous in hers as a leopardess in a silk dress.</p>
    <p>She saw the smile in his eyes and cried, "Don't laugh at me—ever!"</p>
    <p>It occurred to Trevor that civilizing her would take a long time. He doubted if it would ever be done. And he was glad of that.</p>
    <p>She stood looking gravely down at him and then said, "They say you can get up tomorrow."</p>
    <p>"That's good," said Trevor.</p>
    <p>"You'll have to be careful for a while."</p>
    <p>"Yes. I'll be careful."</p>
    <p>They said no more than that, but in her steady, grave gaze Trevor read that Hugh and the hawks were forgiven, not forgotten but forgiven, that they two had touched each other and would not let go again.</p>
    <p>Saul cried anxiously, "Days we've waited! When can we go back to the valley with a ship for the others?"</p>
    <p>Trevor turned to the curiously watching doctor. "Can I charter a ship here?"</p>
    <p>"A man with a sun-stone can get almost anything he wants, Trevor! I'll see about it."</p>
    <p>The chartered ship that took them back to the valley had a minimum crew, and two mining technicians Trevor had hired. They set down outside the ancient city, and the slaves came surging toward them, half in eagerness, half in awe of this embodiment of misty legend.</p>
    <p>Trevor had told Saul what to do. Out up the valley, in the skulls of slain Korins, were sun-stones worth many fortunes. They were going out with the slaves.</p>
    <p>"But they're evil—evil!" Saul had cried.</p>
    <p>"Not in the outside worlds," Trevor told him. "You people are going to need a start somewhere."</p>
    <p>When that was done, when they were all in the ship, Trevor nodded to the two mining technicians.</p>
    <p>"Now," he said. "The entrance to the catacomb is right over there,"</p>
    <p>The two went away, carrying their bulky burden slung between them. Presently they came back again without it.</p>
    <p>Trevor took his sun-stone from his pocket. Jen clutched his arm and cried, "No!"</p>
    <p>"There's no danger now," he said. "He hasn't time enough left to do anything with me. And—I feel somehow that I should tell him—"</p>
    <p>He put the sun-stone to his brow, and in his mind he cried,</p>
    <p>"Shannach!"</p>
    <p>And into his mind came the cold, tremendous presence of the Last One. In an instant it had read Trevor's thoughts.</p>
    <p>"So this is the end, Trevor?"</p>
    <p>"Yes," Trevor said steadily. "The end."</p>
    <p>He was braced for the wild reaction of alarm and passion, the attempt to seize his mind, to avert doom.</p>
    <p>It didn't come. Instead, from the Last One, came a stunning pulse of gladness, of mounting joy.</p>
    <p>"Why—why, you want me to do this?" Trevor cried.</p>
    <p>"Yes, Trevor! Yes! I had thought that the centuries of waiting for death would be long yet, and lonely. But this, this will free me now!"</p>
    <p>Dazed by surprise, Trevor slowly made a gesture, and their ship throbbed upward into the sky. Another gesture, and the technician beside him reached toward the key of the radio-detonator.</p>
    <p>In that moment he felt the mind of Shannach crying out as in a vast, mingled music, a glad chorus of release against chords of cosmic sorrow for all that had been and would never be again, for the greatest and oldest of races that was ending.</p>
    <p>The receding city below erupted flame and rock around the catacomb mouth as the key was pressed.</p>
    <p>And the song of Shannach ebbed into silence, as the last of the children of mountains went forever into night.</p>

    <p>THE TWEENER</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>A taxicab turned the corner and came slowly down the street.</p>
   <p>"Here he is!" shrieked the children, tearing open the white gate. "Mother! Dad! He's here, Uncle Fred's here!"</p>
   <p>Matt Winslow came out onto the porch, and in a minute Lucille came too, flushed from the purgatory of a kitchen on a July day. The cab stopped in front of the house. Josh and Barbie pounced on it like two small tigers, howling, and from up and down the street the neighbors' young came drifting, not making any noise, recognizing that this was the Winslows' moment and not intruding on it, but wanting to be close to it, to breathe and see and hear the magic.</p>
   <p>"Look at them," said Matt half laughing. "You'd think Fred was Tarzan, Santa Claus, and Superman all rolled into one."</p>
   <p>"Well," said Lucille proudly, "not many people have been where he has."</p>
   <p>She went running down the path. Matt followed her. Inside, he was jealous. It was nothing personal, he liked Lucille's brother and respected him. It was only that Josh and Barbie had never had that look in their eyes for him. This was a secret jealousy, that Matt hid carefully, even from himself.</p>
   <p>Fred got out of the cab, trim and soldierly in his uniform with the caduceus on the collar tabs, but forgetting all about dignity as he tried to hug the kids and kiss his sister and shake Matt's hand all at once. "I'll get your bags," said Matt, and the neighbors' children stared with enormous eyes and sent the name of Mars whispering back and forth between them.</p>
   <p>"Be careful," Fred said. "That one there, with the handle on it—let me." He lifted it out, a smallish box made from pieces of packing case that still showed Army serial numbers. It had little round holes bored in its top and sides. Fred waved the children back. "Don't joggle it, it's a rare Martian vase I brought back for your mother, and I don't want it broken. Presents for you? Now what do you think of that—I clean forgot! Oh well, there wasn't much out there you'd have wanted, anyway."</p>
   <p>"Not even a rock?" cried Josh, and Fred shook his head solemnly. "Not a pebble." Barbie was staring at the holes in the box. Matt picked up Fred's suitcase. "He hasn't changed," he thought. "Lost some weight, and got some new lines in his face, but with the kids he hasn't changed. He still acts like one himself." He, too, looked at the holes in the box, but with apprehension. "This is going to be good," he thought. "Something special."</p>
   <p>"God, it's hot," said Fred, screwing up his eyes as though the sunlight hurt them. "Ten months on Mars is no way to train up for an eastern summer. Barbie, don't hang on your old uncle, he's having trouble enough." He glanced at Matt and Lucille, grinning ruefully, and made a pantomime of giving at the knees. "I feel as though I'm wading in glue."</p>
   <p>"Sit down on the porch," Lucille said. "There's a little breeze—"</p>
   <p>"In a minute," Fred said. "But first, don't you want to see your present?" He set the box down, in a shady spot under the big maple at the corner of the house.</p>
   <p>"Now Fred, what are you up to?" she demanded suspiciously. "Martian vases, indeed!"</p>
   <p>"Well, it's not exactly a vase. It's more of a—I'll open it, Josh, you just stand back. This doesn't concern you."</p>
   <p>"Oh, Uncle Fred!" wailed Barbie, dancing up and down like a doll on strings. "Open it up, please open it up."</p>
   <p>Matt had put the suitcase inside the door. Now he came and joined the others under the tree.</p>
   <p>Fred opened the lid of the box. Then he sat back on his heels, watching the children's faces, and Matt thought, "He's been waiting for this for nearly a year, dreaming it up…he should have married and had kids of his own."</p>
   <p>Josh and Barbie let out one mingled cry, and then were still. For a moment.</p>
   <p>"Is it really alive?"</p>
   <p>"Can we touch it?"</p>
   <p>"Will it bite?"</p>
   <p>"Oh, Uncle Fred—oh, look—it does belong to us, doesn't it?"</p>
   <p>Along the fence small boys and girls impaled their meager bellies on the pickets in an effort to see. Matt and Lucille peered down into the box. On a mat of red sand and dry lichens a thing was crouching, a neat furry thing about the size of a big rabbit and not unlike one in outline, except that its ears were cup-shaped, and except that its coat was mottled in the exact rust red and greenish gray of the native sand and lichens. It looked up at the unfamiliar faces with a sort of mild incuriosity, its eyes half shut against the glare, but otherwise it did not move.</p>
   <p>"What on earth is it?" asked Lucille.</p>
   <p>"Nothing," said Fred, "on Earth. On Mars, he's the dominant form of life—or was, until we came. In fact, he's the sole surviving mammal, and almost the sole surviving vertebrate. He doesn't have an official name yet. It'll be years before the zoologists can decide on their classifications. But the boys out there call him tweener."</p>
   <p>"What?" said Lucille.</p>
   <p>"Tweener. Because he's sort of between things. You know—if anyone asked you what he was like, you'd say he was something between a rabbit and a groundhog, or maybe between a monkey and a squirrel. Go ahead, Barbie, pick him up."</p>
   <p>"Now wait a minute," said Matt. He pushed Barbie back. "Wait just a minute. Fred, are you sure about this thing? Is he safe? I don't want the kids bitten, or catching anything."</p>
   <p>"Beside him" said Fred, "a rabbit is dangerous. The tweeners have had no enemies for so long they've forgotten how to fight, and they haven't yet acquired any fear of man. I've pulled 'em out of their burrows with my bare hands."</p>
   <p>He reached into the box and lifted the creature gently, clucking to it. "Anyway, this one has been a pet all his life. I picked him especially because of that. He's acclimated to warmer temperatures and approximately Earth-normal atmosphere, from living in a Base hut, and I thought he'd stand the shock of transplanting better." He held the tweener out. "Here, you take him, Matt. You and Lucille. Set your minds at rest."</p>
   <p>Matt hesitated, and then received the tweener into his hands. It felt like—well, like an animal. Like any small animal you might pick up. Warm, very thick-furred, perhaps more slight in the bone and light in the muscle than he had expected. It had no tail. Its hind legs were not at all rabbit-like, and its forelegs were longer than he had thought. It placed a paw on his arm, a curious paw with three strong fingers and a thumb, and lifted its head, sniffing. The sunlight was brighter here, falling in a shaft between the branches, and the tweener's eyes were almost shut, giving it a look of sleepy imbecility. Matt stroked it awkwardly, once or twice, and it rubbed its head against his arm. Matt shivered. "That soft fur," he said. "It tickles, sort of. Want him, Lucille?"</p>
   <p>She looked sternly at Fred. "No germs?"</p>
   <p>"No germs."</p>
   <p>"All right." She took the tweener the way she would have taken a cat, holding him up under the forelegs and looking him over while he dangled, limp and patient. Finally she smiled. "He's cute. I think I'm going to like him." She set him carefully on his feet in the green grass. "All right, you kids. And be careful you don't hurt him."</p>
   <p>Once more Josh and Barbie were speechless, if not silent. They lay on the ground and touched and patted and peered and took turns holding, and the ragged fringe of small bodies on the fence dripped and flowed inward until the yard was full of children and the stranger from Mars was hidden out of sight.</p>
   <p>"Kids," said Fred, and laughed. "It's nice to see them again. And normal people."</p>
   <p>"What do you mean, normal?"</p>
   <p>Fred said wryly. "I had to be doctor and psychiatrist. I've had xenophobes crawling all over me for ten long months."</p>
   <p>"Xeno—what?" asked Lucille.</p>
   <p>"A two-dollar word for men who fear the unknown. When chaps got to worrying too much about what was over the horizon, they were dumped on me. But the heck with that. Take me somewhere cool and drown me in beer."</p>
   <p>It was a long hot afternoon, and a long hot evening, and they belonged mostly to Fred. To the children he seemed ten feet high and shining with the hero-light. To the neighbors who dropped in to say hello, he was a man who had actually visited a place they still did not quite believe in.</p>
   <p>The children, the whole gaggle of them, hunkered in a circle around the chairs that had been dragged to the coolest spot in the yard.</p>
   <p>"Is it like in the books, Uncle Fred? Is it?"</p>
   <p>Fred groaned, and pointed to the tweener in Barbie's arms. "Get him to tell you. He knows better than I do."</p>
   <p>"Of course he does," said Barbie; "John Carter knows everything. But—"</p>
   <p>"Who?" asked Fred.</p>
   <p>"John Carter. John Carter of Mars."</p>
   <p>Fred laughed. "Good. That's a good name. You get it, don't you, Matt? Remember all those wonderful Edgar Rice Burroughs stories about the Warlord of Mars, and the Swordsman of Mars, and the Gods of Mars?"</p>
   <p>"Sure," said Matt, rather sourly. "The kids read 'em all the time. John Carter is the hero, the kind with a capital H." He turned to the children. "But John Carter was an Earthman, who went to Mars."</p>
   <p>"Well," said Josh, scornfully impatient of adult illogic, "he's a Martian who came to Earth. It's the same thing. Isn't it, Uncle Fred?"</p>
   <p>"You might say that, like the other John Carter, he's a citizen of two worlds."</p>
   <p>"Yes," said Barbie. "But anyway, we can't understand his language yet, so you'll have to tell us about Mars."</p>
   <p>"Oh, all right," said Fred, and he told them about Mars, about the dark canals and the ruined cities, about the ancient towers standing white and lonely under the twin moons, about beautiful princesses and wicked kings and mighty swordsmen. And after they had gone away again to play with John Carter, Matt shook his head and said, "You ought to be ashamed, filling their heads up with that stuff."</p>
   <p>Fred grinned. "Time enough for reality when they grow up."</p>
   <p>It got later, and the night closed in. Neighbors came and went. The extra children disappeared. It grew quiet, and finally there was no one left but the Winslows and Fred. Matt went inside to the kitchen for more beer.</p>
   <p>From somewhere in the remote darkness beyond the open windows, Barbie screamed.</p>
   <p>The can he was opening fell out of Matt's hand, making a geyser of foam where it hit the floor. "If that little—" he said, and did not stop to finish the sentence. He ran out the kitchen door.</p>
   <p>Fred and Lucille had jumped up. Barbie's shrieks were coming from the foot of the lot, where the garage was, and now Matt could hear Josh yelling. He ran across the lawn and onto the drive. Lucille was behind him, calling, "Barbie! Josh! What is it?"</p>
   <p>In the dim reflection of light from the house, Matt could make out the small figure of Josh bent over and tugging frantically at the handle of the overhead door, which was closed tight. "Help!" he panted. "It's stuck, or something."</p>
   <p>Matt brushed him aside. Beyond the door, in the dark garage, Barbie was still screaming. Matt took hold of the handle and heaved.</p>
   <p>It was jammed, but not so badly that his greater strength could not force it up. It slid, clicking and grumbling, into place, and Matt rushed into the opening.</p>
   <p>Barbie was standing just inside, her mouth stretched over another scream, her cheeks running streams of tears. John Carter was beside her. He was standing on his hind legs, almost erect, and the fingers of one fore-paw were gripped tightly around Barbie's thumb. His eyes were wide open. In the kindly night there was no hot glare to bother them, and they looked out, green-gold and very, very bright. Something rose up into Matt's throat and closed it. He reached out, and Barbie shook off John Carter's grip and flung herself into Matt's arms.</p>
   <p>"Oh, Daddy, it was so dark and Josh couldn't get the door open—"</p>
   <p>Josh came in and picked up John Carter. "Aw, girls," he said, quite scornful now that the emergency was over. "Just because she gets stuck in the garage for a few. minutes, she has to have hysterics."</p>
   <p>"What in the world were you doing?" Lucille demanded weakly, feeling Barbie all over.</p>
   <p>"Just playing," said Josh, sulking. "How should I know the old door wouldn't work?"</p>
   <p>"She's okay," Fred said. "Just scared."</p>
   <p>Lucille groaned deeply. "And they wonder why mothers turn gray at an early age. All right, you two, off to bed. Scoot!"</p>
   <p>Josh started toward the house with Barbie, still clutching John Carter.</p>
   <p>"Oh, no," said Matt. "You're not taking that thing to bed with you." He caught John Carter by the loose skin of his shoulders and pulled him out of the boy's arms. Josh spun around, all ready to make trouble about it, and Fred said smoothly, "I'll take him."</p>
   <p>He did, holding him more gently than Matt. "Your father's right, Josh. No pets in the bedroom. And anyway, John Carter wouldn't be comfortable there. He likes a nice cool place where he can dig his own house and make the rooms just to suit him."</p>
   <p>"Like a catacomb?" asked Barbie, in a voice still damp and tremulous.</p>
   <p>"Or a cave?" asked Josh.</p>
   <p>"Exactly. Now you run along, and your father and I will fix him up."</p>
   <p>"Well," said Josh. "Okay." He held out a finger and John Carter wrapped a paw around it. Josh shook hands solemnly. "Good night." Then he looked up. "Uncle Fred, if he digs like a woodchuck, how come his front feet are like a monkey's?"</p>
   <p>"Because," said Fred, "he didn't start out to be a digger. And he is much more like an ape than a woodchuck. But there haven't been any trees in his country for a long time, and he had to take to the ground anyway to keep warm. That's what we call adaptation." He turned to Matt. "How about the old root cellar? It'd be ideal for him, if you're still not using it for anything."</p>
   <p>"No," said Matt slowly. "I'm not using it." He looked at John Carter in the dim light from the house, and John Carter looked back at him with those bright unearthly eyes.</p>
   <p>Matt put a hand up to his head, aware that it had begun to ache. "My sinus is kicking up—probably going to rain tomorrow. I think I'll turn in myself, if you don't mind."</p>
   <p>"Go ahead, honey," Lucille said. "I'll help Fred with the tweener."</p>
   <p>Matt took two aspirin on top of his beer, which made him feel no better, and retired into a heavy sleep, through which stalked dark and unfamiliar dreams that would not show their faces.</p>
   <p>The next day was Sunday. It did not rain, but Matt's head went on aching.</p>
   <p>"Are you sure it's your sinus?" Lucille asked.</p>
   <p>"Oh, yes. All in the right side, frontal and maxillary. Even my teeth hurt."</p>
   <p>"Hm," said Fred. "Don't ever go to Mars. Sinusitis is an occupational hazard there, in spite of oxygen masks. Something about the difference in pressure that raises hob with terrestrial insides. Why, do you know—"</p>
   <p>"No," said Matt sourly, "and I don't want to know. Save your gruesome stories for your medical conference."</p>
   <p>Fred winced. "I wish you hadn't mentioned that. I hate the thought of New York in this kind of weather. Damn it, it's cruelty to animals. And speaking of which—" he turned to Josh and Barbie—"keep John Carter in the cellar until this heat wave breaks. At least it's fairly cool down there. Remember he wasn't built for this climate, nor for this world. Give him a break."</p>
   <p>"Oh, we will," said Barbie earnestly. "Besides, he's busy, building his castle. You ought to see the wall he's making around it."</p>
   <p>Working slowly, resting often, John Carter had begun the construction of an elaborate burrow in the soft floor of the old root cellar. They went down and watched him from time to time, bringing up earth and then patting and shaping it with his clever paws into a neat rampart to protect his front door. "To deflect wind and sand," Fred said, and Barbie, watching with fascinated eyes, murmured, "I'll bet he could build anything he wanted to, if he was big enough."</p>
   <p>"Maybe. Matter of fact, he probably was a good bit bigger once, a long time ago when things weren't so tough. But—"</p>
   <p>"As big as me?" asked Josh.</p>
   <p>"Possibly. But if he built anything then we haven't been able to find it. Or anything at all that anybody built. Except, of course," he added hastily, "those cities I was telling you about."</p>
   <p>The heat wave broke that night in a burst of savage line-squalls. "That's what my head was complaining about," thought Matt, rousing up to blink at the lightning. And then he slept again, and dreamed, dim sad dreams of loss and yearning. In the morning his head still ached.</p>
   <p>Fred went down to New York for his conference. Matt went to the office and stewed, finding it hard to keep his mind on his work with the nagging pain in the side of his skull. He began to worry. He had never had a bout go on this long. He fidgeted more and more as the day wore on, and then hurried home oppressed by a vague unease that he could find no foundation for.</p>
   <p>"All right?" Lucille echoed. "Of course everything's all right. Why?"</p>
   <p>"I don't know. Nothing. The kids—?"</p>
   <p>"They've been playing Martian all day. Matt, I've never seen them so tickled with anything in their lives as they are with that little beastie. And he's so cute and patient with them. Come here a minute."</p>
   <p>She led him to the door of the children's room, and pointed in. Josh and Barbie arrayed in striped beach towels and some of Lucille's junkier costume jewelry, were engaged in a complicated ritual that involved much posturing and waving of wooden swords. In the center of the room enthroned on a chair, John Carter sat. He had a length of bright cloth wrapped around him and a gold bracelet on his neck. He sat perfectly still, watching the children with his usual half-lidded stare, and Matt said harshly, "It isn't right."</p>
   <p>"What isn't?"</p>
   <p>"Any ordinary animal wouldn't stand for it. Look at him, just squatting there like a—" He hunted for a word and couldn't find it.</p>
   <p>"The gravity," Lucille reminded him. "He hardly moves at all, poor little thing. And it seems quite hard for him to breathe."</p>
   <p>Josh and Barbie knelt side by side in front of the throne, holding their swords high in the air. "Koar!" they cried to John Carter, and then Josh stood up again and began to talk in gibberish, but respectfully, as though addressing a king.</p>
   <p>"That's Martian," said Lucille, and winked at Matt. "Sometimes you'd swear they were actually speaking a language. Come on and stretch out on the couch a while, honey, why don't you? You look tired."</p>
   <p>"I am tired," he said. "And I—" He stopped.</p>
   <p>"What?"</p>
   <p>"Nothing." No, nothing at all. He lay down on the couch. Lucille went into the kitchen. He could hear her moving about, making the usual noises. Faintly, far off, he heard the children's voices. Sometimes you'd swear they were actually speaking a language. Sometime you'd swear—</p>
   <p>No. No you wouldn't. You know what is, and what isn't. Even the kids know.</p>
   <p>He dozed, and the children's voices crept into his dream. They spoke in the thin and icy wind and murmured in the dust that blew beneath it, and there was no doubt at all now that they were speaking a tongue they knew and understood. He called to them, but they did not answer, and he knew that they did not want to answer, that they were hiding from him somewhere among the ridges of red sand that flowed and shifted so that there was never a trail or a landmark. He ran among the dunes, shouting their names, and then there was a tumble of ancient rock where a mountain had died, and a hollow place below it with a tinge of green around a meager pool. He knew that they were there in that hollow place. He raced toward it, racing the night that deepened out of a sky already dark and flecked with stars, and in the dusk a shape rose up and blocked his way. It bore in its right hand a blade of grass—no, a sword. A sword, and its face was shadowed, but its eyes looked out at him, green-gold and bright and not of the Earth—</p>
   <p>"For heaven's sake, Matt—wake up!" Lucille was shaking him. He sprang up, still in the grip of his dream, and saw Josh and Barbie standing on the other side of the room. They had their ordinary clothes on, and they were grinning, and Barbie said, "How can you have a nightmare when it's still daytime?"</p>
   <p>"I don't know," said Lucille, "but it must have been a dandy. Come on Matt, and get your dinner, before the neighbors decide I'm beating you."</p>
   <p>"Other people's nightmares," Matt snarled, "are always so funny. Where's John Carter?"</p>
   <p>"Oh, we put him back down cellar," Josh said, quite unconcerned. "Mom, will you get him some more lettuce tomorrow? He sure goes for it."</p>
   <p>Feeling shamefaced and a little sick, Matt sat down and ate his dinner. He did not enjoy it. Nor did he sleep well that night, starting up more than once from the verge of an ugly dream. Next day Gulf Tropical had come in again worse than before, and his head had not stopped aching.</p>
   <p>He went to his doctor, who could find no sign of infection but gave him a shot on general principles. He went to his office, but it was only a gesture. He returned home at noon on a two-day sick leave. The temperature had crept up to ninety and the humidity dripped out of the air in sharp crashing showers.</p>
   <p>"I'll bet Fred's suffering in New York," Lucille said. "And poor John Carter! I haven't let the kids take him out of the cellar at all."</p>
   <p>"Do you know what he did, Daddy?" Barbie said. "Josh found it this morning after you left."</p>
   <p>"What?" asked Matt, with an edge in his voice.</p>
   <p>"A hole," said Josh. "He must've tunneled right under the foundation. It was in the lawn, just outside where the root cellar is. I guess he's used to having a back door to his castle, but I filled it in. I filled it real good and put a great big stone on top."</p>
   <p>Matt relaxed. "He'll only dig another."</p>
   <p>Barbie shook her head. "He better not. I told him what would happen if he did, how a big dog might kill him, or he might get lost and never find his way home again."</p>
   <p>"Poor little tyke," Lucille said. "He'll never find his home again."</p>
   <p>"Oh, the hell with him," Matt said angrily. "Couldn't you waste a little sympathy on me? I feel lousy."</p>
   <p>He went upstairs away from them and tried to lie down, but the room was a sweat-box. He tossed and groaned and came down again, and Lucille fixed him iced lemonade. He sat in the shade on the back porch and drank it. It hit his stomach cold and sour-sweet and it tied him in knots, and he got up to pace the lawn. The heat weighed and dragged at him. His head throbbed and his knees felt weak. He passed the place where Josh had filled in the new tunnel, and from the cellar window he heard the children's voices. He turned around and stamped back into the house.</p>
   <p>"What are you doing down there?" he shouted, through the open cellar door.</p>
   <p>Barbie's answer came muffled and hollow from the gloom below. "We brought John Carter some ice to lick on, but he won't come out." She began to talk in a different tone, softly, crooning, calling. Matt said, "Come up out of there before you catch cold!"</p>
   <p>"In a minute," Josh said.</p>
   <p>Matt went down the steps, his shoes thumping on the wooden treads. They had not turned on the lights, and what came through the small dusty windows was only enough to show the dim outlines of things. He banged his head on a heating duct and swore, and Barbie said rather impatiently, "We said we'd be up in a minute."</p>
   <p>"What's the matter?" Matt demanded, blundering around the furnace. "Am I not supposed to come down here any more?"</p>
   <p>"Sh-h!" Josh told him. "There, he's just coming out. Don't scare him back in again!"</p>
   <p>The door of the root cellar was open. The children were crouched inside it, by the earthen rampart John Carter had constructed with such labor. In the circle of the rampart was a dark hole, and from it John Carter was emerging, very slowly, his eyes luminescent in the gloom. Barbie put two ice cubes on the ground before him, and he set his muzzle against them and lay panting, his flanks pulsing in a shallow, uneven rhythm.</p>
   <p>"You'll be all right,*' Josh told him, and stroked his head. To Matt he said, "You don't understand how important he is. There isn't another kid anywhere around who has a real genuine Martian for a pet."</p>
   <p>"Come on," said Matt harshly. "Upstairs." The clammy air was making him shiver. Reluctantly the children rose and went past him. John Carter did not stir. He looked at Matt, and Matt drew back, slamming the door shut. He followed the children out of the cellar, but in his mind's eye he could still see John Carter crouched behind his wall in the dark, tortured by a world that was not his, a world too big, too hot, too heavy.</p>
   <p>Crouched behind his wall in the dark, and thinking.</p>
   <p>No. Animals do not think. They feel. They can be lost, or frightened, or suffering, or a lot of things, but they're all feelings, not thoughts. Only humans think.</p>
   <p>On Earth.</p>
   <p>Matt went out in the yard again. He went clear to the back of it where the fence ran along the alley, and took hold of the pickets in his two hands. He stood there staring at the neighbors' back fences, at their garages and garbage cans, not seeing them, feeling the vague conviction that had been in the back of his mind grow and take shape and advance to a point where he could no longer pretend he didn't see it.</p>
   <p>"No," he said to himself. "Fred would have known. The scientists would know. It couldn't be, and not be known."</p>
   <p>Or couldn't it? How did you measure possibility on another world?</p>
   <p>The only mammal, Fred had said, and almost the only vertebrate. Why should one sole species survive when all the others were gone, unless it had an edge to begin with, an advantage?</p>
   <p>Suppose a race. Suppose intelligence. Intelligence, perhaps, of a sort that human men, Earthly men, would not understand.</p>
   <p>Suppose a race and a world. A dying world. Suppose that race being forced to change with its dying, to dwindle and adapt, to lose its cities and its writings and inventions, or whatever had taken the place of them, but not its mind. Never its mind, because mind would be the only barrier against destruction.</p>
   <p>Suppose that race, physically altered, environmentally destitute, driven inward on its own thoughts. Wouldn't it evolve all kinds of mental compensations, powers no Earthman would suspect or look for because he would be flunking in terms of what he knew, of Earthly life-forms? And wouldn't such a race go to any lengths to hide its intelligence, its one last weapon, from the strangers who had come trampling in to take its world away?</p>
   <p>Matt trembled. He looked up at the sky, and be knew what was different about it. It was no longer a solid shell that covered him. It was wide open, ripped and torn by the greedy ships, carrying the greedy men who had not been content with what they had. And through those rents the Outside had slipped in, and it would never be the same again. Never more the safe familiar Earth containing only what belonged to it, only what men could understand.</p>
   <p>He stood there while a shower of rain crashed down and drenched him, and he did not feel it.</p>
   <p>Then again, fiercely, Matt said, "No. I won't believe that, it's too—it's like the kids believing their games while they play them."</p>
   <p>But were they only games?</p>
   <p>He started at the sound of Lucille's voice calling him in. He knew by the sound of it she was worried. He went back toward the house. She came part way to meet him, demanding to know what he was doing out in the rain. He let her chivvy him into the house and into dry clothes, and he kept telling her there was nothing wrong, but she was alarmed now and would not listen. "You lie down," she said and covered him with a quilt, and then he heard her go downstairs and get on the telephone. He lay quiet for a few minutes, trying to get himself in hand, frightened and half ashamed of the state of his nerves. Sweat began to roll off him. He kicked the quilt away. The air inside the room was thick with moisture, heavy, stale. He found himself panting like—</p>
   <p>Hell, it was no different from any summer heat wave, the bedroom was always hot and suffocating. It was always hard to breathe.</p>
   <p>He left it and went downstairs.</p>
   <p>Lucille was just getting up from the phone. "Who were you calling?" he asked.</p>
   <p>"Fred," she said, giving him that no-nonsense look she got when she decided that something had to be done. "He said he'd be here in the morning. I'm going to find out what's the matter with you."</p>
   <p>Matt said irritably, "But my doctor—"</p>
   <p>"Your doctor doesn't know you like Fred does, and he doesn't care as much about you, either."</p>
   <p>Matt grumbled, but it was too late to do anything about it now. Then he began to think that maybe Fred was the answer. Maybe if he told him—</p>
   <p>What?</p>
   <p>All right, drag it out, put it into words. I think John Carter is more than a harmless little beast. I think he's intelligent. I think that he hates me, that he hates this Earth where he's been brought so casually as a pet. I think he's doing something to my children.</p>
   <p>Could he say that to Fred?</p>
   <p>Lucille was calling the children for supper. "Oh lord, they're down in that damp cellar again. Josh, Barbie, come up here this minute!"</p>
   <p>Matt put his head between his hands. It hurt.</p>
   <p>He slept downstairs that night, on the living-room couch. He had done that before during heat waves. It gave the illusion of being cooler. He dosed himself heavily with aspirin, and for a time he lapsed into a drugged slumber full of dark shapes that pursued him over a landscape he could not quite see but which he knew was alien and hateful. Then in the silent hours between midnight and dawn he started up in panic. He could not breathe. The air was as thick as water, and a weight as of mountain ranges lay along his chest, his thighs, his shoulders.</p>
   <p>He turned on a lamp and began to move up and down, his chest heaving, his hands never still, a glassy terror spreading over him, sheathing him as a sleet storm sheathes a tree.</p>
   <p>The living room looked strange, the familiar things overlaid with a gloss of fear, traces everywhere of Josh and Barbie, of Lucille and himself, suddenly significant, suddenly sharp and poignantly symbolic as items in a Dali painting. Lucille's lending-library novel with the brown paper cover, Lucille's stiff Staffordshire figures on the mantel staring with their stiff white faces. An empty pop bottle, no, two empty pop bottles shoved guiltily behind the couch. Small blue jacket with the pocket torn, a drift of comic books under the lamp, his own chair with the cushion worn hollow by his own sitting. Patterns. Wall-paper, slipcovers, rug. Colors, harsh and queer. He was aware of the floor beneath his feet. It was thin. It was a skim of ice over a black pool, ready to crack and let him fall, into the place where the stranger lay, and thought, and waited.</p>
   <p>All over Mars they lie and wait, he thought, in their places under the ground. Thinking back and forth in the bitter nights, hating the men, human men who pull them out of their burrows and kill them and dissect them and pry at their brains and bones and nerves and organs. The men who tie little strings around their necks and put them in cages, and never think to look behind their eyes and see what lurks there.</p>
   <p>Hating, and wanting their world back. Hating, and quietly driving men insane.</p>
   <p>Just as this one is doing to me, he thought. He's suffering. He's crushed in this gravity, and strangling in this air, and he's going to make me suffer too. He knows he can never go home. He knows he's dying. How far can he push it? Can he only make me feel what he's feeling, or can he…?</p>
   <p>Suppose he can. Suppose he knows I'm going to tell Fred. Suppose he stops me.</p>
   <p>After that, what? Josh? Barbie? Lucille?</p>
   <p>Matt stood still in the middle of the floor. "He's killing me," he thought. "He knows."</p>
   <p>He began to shake. The room turned dark in front of him. He wanted to vomit, but there was a strange paralysis creeping over him, tightening his muscles, knotting them into ropes to bind him. He felt cold, as though he were already dead.</p>
   <p>He turned. He did not run, he was past running, but he walked faster with every step, stiffly, like a mechanical thing wound up and accelerating toward a magnetic goal. He opened the cellar door, and the steps took him down. He remembered to switch on the light.</p>
   <p>It was only a short distance to the north corner, and the half-open door.</p>
   <p>John Carter made a sound, the only one Matt had ever heard him make. A small thin shriek, purely animal and quite, quite brainless.</p>
   <p>It was the next morning, and Fred had come on the early train. They were standing, all of them, grouped together on the lawn near the back fence, looking down. The children were crying.</p>
   <p>"A dog must have got him," Matt said. He had said that before, but his voice still lacked the solid conviction of a statement known and believed. He wanted to look up and away from what lay on the ground by his feet, but he did not. Fred was facing him.</p>
   <p>"Poor little thing," said Lucille. "I suppose it must have been a dog. Can you tell, Fred?"</p>
   <p>Fred bent over. Matt stared at his own shoes. Inside his pockets, his hands were curled tightly into fists. He wanted to talk. The temptation, the longing, the lust to talk was almost more than he could endure. He put the edges of his tongue between his teeth and bit it.</p>
   <p>After a minute Fred said, "It was a dog."</p>
   <p>Matt glanced at him, and now it was Fred who scowled at his shoes.</p>
   <p>"I hope it didn't hurt him," Lucille said.</p>
   <p>Fred said, "I don't think it did."</p>
   <p>Miserably, between his sobs, Josh wailed, "I used the biggest stone I could find. I never thought he could have moved it."</p>
   <p>"There, now," said Lucille, putting her arms around the children. She led them away toward the house, talking briskly, the usual mixture of nonsense and sound truth that parents administer at such times. Matt wanted to go away too, but Fred made no move, and somehow he knew that it was no use going. He stood with his head down, feeling the sun beat on the back of it like a hammer on a flinching anvil.</p>
   <p>He wished Fred would say something. Fred remained silent.</p>
   <p>Finally Matt said, "Thanks."</p>
   <p>"I didn't see any reason to tell them. They'd find it hard to understand."</p>
   <p>"Do you understand?" Matt cried out. "I don't. Why did I do such a thing? How could I have done such a thing?"</p>
   <p>"Fear. I think I mentioned that once. Xenophobia."</p>
   <p>"But that's not—I mean, I don't see how it applies."</p>
   <p>"It's not just a fear of unknown places, but of unknown things. Anything at all that's strange and unfamiliar." He shook his head. "I'll admit I didn't expect to find that at home, but I should have thought of the possibility. It's something to remember."</p>
   <p>"I was so sure," Matt said. "It all fitted together, everything."</p>
   <p>"The human imagination is a wonderful thing. I know, I've just put in ten months nursing it. I suppose you had symptoms?"</p>
   <p>"God, yes." Matt enumerated them. "Last night it got so bad I thought—" He glanced at the small body by his feet. "As soon as I did that it all went away. Even the headache. What's the word? Psycho-something?"</p>
   <p>"Psychosomatic. Yes. The guys out there developed everything from corns to angina, scared of where they were and wanting to leave it."</p>
   <p>"I'm ashamed," Matt said. "I feel…" He moved his hands.</p>
   <p>"Well," said Fred, "it was only an animal. Probably it wouldn't have lived long anyway. I shouldn't have brought it."</p>
   <p>"Oh for Chrissake," Matt said, and turned away. Josh and Barbie were coming out of the house again. Josh carried a box, and Barbie had a bunch of flowers and a spade. They passed by the place on the lawn where the big stone had been moved and the hole opened up again—only part way, and from the outside, but Matt hoped they would not know that. He hoped they would not ever know that.</p>
   <p>He went to meet them.</p>
   <p>He kneeled down and put an arm around each of them. "Don't feel bad," he said desperately. "Look I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll go and find the best place in the country to buy a pup. Wouldn't you like that, a fine new puppy, all your own?"</p>

    <p>THE QUEER ONES</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>I ran down Buckhorn Mountain in the cloud and rain, carrying the boy in my arms. The green lightning flashed among the trees. Buckhorn is no stranger to lightning, but this was different. It did not come from the clouds, and there was no thunder with it. It ran low, searching the thickets, the brush-choked gullies, the wet hollows full of brambles and poison ivy. Thick green hungry snakes looking for something. Looking for me.</p>
   <p>Looking for the boy who had started it all.</p>
   <p>He peered up at me, clinging like a lemur to my coat as I went headlong down the slope. His eyes were copper colored. They had seen a lot for all the two-and-a-half years they had been open on this world. They were frightened now, not just vaguely as you might expect from a child his age, but intelligently. And in his curiously sweet shrill voice he asked:</p>
   <p>"Why mus' they kill us?"</p>
   <p>"Never mind," I said, and ran and ran, and the green lightning hunted us down the mountainside.</p>
   <p>It was Doc Callendar, the County Health Officer, who got me in on the whole thing. I am Hank Temple, owner, editor, feature writer, legman, and general roustabout of the Newhale News, serving Newhale and the rural and mountain areas around it. Doc Callendar, Sheriff Ed Betts and I are old friends, and we work together, helping out where we can. So one hot morning in July my phone rang and it was Doc, sounding kind of dazed.</p>
   <p>"Hank?" he said. "I'm at the hospital: Would you want to take a run up here for a minute?"</p>
   <p>"Who's hurt?"</p>
   <p>"Nobody. Just thought something might interest you."</p>
   <p>Doc was being cagey because anything you say over the phone in Newhale is public property. But even so the tone of his voice put prickles between my shoulder-blades. It didn't sound like Doc at all.</p>
   <p>"Sure," I said. "Right away."</p>
   <p>Newhale is the county seat, a small town, and a high town. It lies in an upland hollow of the Appalachians, a little clutter of old red brick buildings with porches on thin wooden pillars, and frame houses ranging from new white to weathered silver-gray, centered around the dumpy courthouse. A very noisy stream bisects the town. The tannery and the feed-mill are its chief industries, with some mining nearby. The high-line comes down a neat cut on Tunkhannock Ridge to the east and goes away up a neat cut on Goat Hill to the west. Over all towers the rough impressive hump of Buckhorn Mountain, green on the ridges, shadowed blue in the folds, wrapped more often than not in a mist of cloud.</p>
   <p>There is not much money nor any great fame to be made in Newhale, but there are other reasons for living here. The girl I wanted to marry couldn't quite see them, and it's hard to explain to a woman why you would rather have six pages of small-town newspaper that belong to you than the whole of the New York Times if you only work for it. I gave up trying, and she went off to marry a gray flannel suit, and every time I unlimber my fishing-rod or my deer rifle I'm happy for her.</p>
   <p>The hospital is larger than you might expect, since it serves a big part of the county. Sitting on a spur of Goat Hill well away from the tannery, it's an old building with a couple of new wings tacked on. I found Doc Callendar in his office, with Bossert. Bossert is the resident doctor, a young guy who knows more, in the old phrase, than a jackass could haul downhill. This morning he looked as though he wasn't sure of his own name.</p>
   <p>"Yesterday," Doc said, "one of the Tate girls brought her kid in, a little boy. I wasn't here, I was out testing those wells up by Pinecrest. But I've seen him before. He's a stand-out, a real handsome youngster."</p>
   <p>"Precocious," said Jim Bossert nervously. "Very precocious for his age. Physically, too. Coordination and musculature well developed. And his coloring—"</p>
   <p>"What about it?" I asked.</p>
   <p>"Odd. I don't know. I noticed it, and then forgot it. The kid looked as though he'd been through a meat-grinder. His mother said the other kids had ganged up and beaten him, and he hadn't been right for several days, so she reckoned she'd better bring him in. She's not much more than nineteen herself. I took some X-rays—"</p>
   <p>Bossert picked up a couple of pictures from the desk and shoved them at me. His hands shook, making the stiff films rattle together.</p>
   <p>"I didn't want to trust myself on these. I waited until Callendar could check them, too."</p>
   <p>I held the pictures up and looked at them. They showed a small, frail bony structure and the usual shadowy outline of internal organs. It wasn't until I had looked at them for several minutes that I began to realize there was something peculiar about them. There seemed to be too few ribs, the articulation of the joints looked queer even to my layman's eyes, and the organs themselves were a hopeless jumble.</p>
   <p>"Some of the innards," said Doc, "we can't figure out at all. There are organs we've never seen nor heard of before."</p>
   <p>"Yet the chad seems normal and perfectly healthy," said Bossert. "Remarkably so. From the beating he'd taken he should have had serious injuries. He was just sore. His body must be as flexible and tough as spring steel."</p>
   <p>I put the X-rays back on the desk. "Isn't there quite a large literature on medical anomalies?"</p>
   <p>"Oh, yes," said Doc. "Double hearts, upside-down stomachs, extra arms, legs, heads—almost any distortion or variation you can think of. But not like this." He leaned over and tapped his finger emphatically on the films. "This isn't a distortion of anything. This is different. And that's not all."</p>
   <p>He pushed a microscope slide toward me.</p>
   <p>"That's the capper, Hank. Blood sample. Jim tried to type it. I tried to type it. We couldn't. There isn't any such type."</p>
   <p>I stared at them. Their faces were flushed, their eyes were bright, they quivered with excitement, and suddenly it got to me too.</p>
   <p>"Wait a minute," I said. "Are you trying to tell me—"</p>
   <p>"We've got something here," said Doc Callendar. "Something—" He shook his head. I could see the dreams in it. I could see Callendar standing ten feet tall on a pedestal of medical journals. I could see him on podiums addressing audiences of breathless men, and the same dreams were in Bossert's eyes.</p>
   <p>I had my own. The Newhale News suddenly a famous name on the wire-services, and one Henry Temple bowing with modest dignity as he accepted the Pulitzer Prize for journalism.</p>
   <p>"Big," said Bossert softly. "The boy is more than a freak. He's something new. A mutation. Almost a new species. The blood-type alone—"</p>
   <p>Something occurred to me and I cut him short. "Listen," I said. "Listen, are you sure you didn't make a mistake or something? How could the boy's blood be so different from his mother's?" I hunted for the word. "Incompatibility. He'd never have been born."</p>
   <p>"Nevertheless," said Doc Callendar mildly, "he was born. And nevertheless, there is no such blood-type. We've run tests backward and forward, together and independently. Kindly allow us to know what we're talking about, Hank. The boy's blood obviously must have been compatible with his mother's. Possibly it's a more advanced Type O, universally compatible. This is only one of the many things we have to study and evaluate."</p>
   <p>He picked up the X-ray films again and looked at them, with an expression of holy ecstasy in his eyes.</p>
   <p>I lighted another cigarette. My hands were shaking now, like theirs. I leaned forward.</p>
   <p>"Okay," I said. "What's the first thing we do?"</p>
   <p>Doc's station wagon, with COUNTY HEALTH SERVICE painted on its side, slewed and snorted around the turns of the steep dirt road. Jim Bossert had had to stay at the hospital, but I was sitting beside Doc, hunched forward in a sweat of impatience. The road ran up around the shoulder of Tunkhannock Ridge. We had thick dark woods on our right going up, and thick dark woods on our left going down. Buckhorn hung in the north like a curtain across the sky.</p>
   <p>"We'll have to be careful," Doc was saying. "I know these people pretty well. If they get the idea we're trying to pull something, we'll never get another look at the kid."</p>
   <p>"You handle it," I said. "And by the way, nobody's mentioned the boy's father. Doesn't he have one?"</p>
   <p>"Do you know the Tate girls?"</p>
   <p>"No. I've been through Possum Creek all right, but through it is all."</p>
   <p>"You must have gone fast," said Doc, grinning. "The answer is physiologically yes, legally are you kidding?" He shifted into second, taking it easy over a place where the road was washed and gullied. "They're not a bad bunch of girls at that, though," he added reflectively. "I kind of like them. Couple of them are downright married."</p>
   <p>We bucketed on through the hot green shadows, the great centers of civilization like Newhale forgotten in the distance behind us, and finally in a remote pocket just under Tunkhannock's crest we came upon a few lean spry cattle, and then the settlement of Possum Creek.</p>
   <p>There were four ancient houses straggled out along the side of the stream. One of them said GENERAL STORE and had a gas pump in front of it. Two old men sat on the step.</p>
   <p>Doc kept on going. "The Tates," he said, straight-faced, "live out a little from the center of town."</p>
   <p>Two more turns of the road, which was now only a double-rutted track, brought us to a rural mailbox which said TATE. The house behind it was pretty well run down, but there was glass in most of the windows and only half the bricks were gone from the chimney. The clapboards were sort of a rusty brown, patched up with odds and ends of tarpaper. A woman was washing clothes in an old galvanized tub set on a stand in the side yard. There was a television aerial tied on cockeyed to the gable of the house. There was a sow with a litter in a pen right handy to the door, and a little way at the back was a barn with the ridge-pole swayed like an old horse. A tarpaper shack and a battered house-trailer were visible among the trees—probably the homes of the married daughters. An ancient man sat in an ancient rocking chair on the porch and peered at us, and an ancient dog beside him rose up heavily and barked.</p>
   <p>I've known quite a lot of families like the Tates. They scratch out enough corn for their pigs and their still-houses, and enough garden for themselves. The young men make most of their money as guides during hunting season, and the old men make theirs selling moonshine. They have electricity now, and they can afford radios and even television sets. City folks call them lazy and shiftless. Actually, they find the simple life so pleasant that they hate to let hard work spoil their enjoyment of it.</p>
   <p>Doc drove his station wagon into the yard and stopped. Instantly there was an explosion of dogs and children and people.</p>
   <p>"There he is," Doc said to me, under cover of the whooping and woofing and the banging of screen doors.</p>
   <p>"The skinny little chap with the red hair. There, just coming down the steps."</p>
   <p>I looked over and saw the boy.</p>
   <p>He was an odd one, all right. The rest of the Tate tribe all had straight hair ranging from light brown to honey-blond. His was close and curly to his head and I saw what Jim Bossert had meant about his coloring. The red had undertones of something else in it. One would almost, in that glare of sunlight, have said silver. The Tates had blue eyes. His were copper-colored. The Tates were fair and sunburned, and so was he, but there was a different quality of fairness to his skin, a different shading to the tan.</p>
   <p>He was a little boy. The Tate children were rangy and big boned. He moved among them lightly, a gazelle among young goats, with a totally unchildlike grace and sureness. His head was narrow, with a very high arch to the skull. His eyes were grave, precociously wise. Only in the mouth was there genuine childishness, soft and shy.</p>
   <p>We got out of the car. The kids—a dozen of them, give or take a couple—all stopped as though on a signal and began to study their bare feet. The woman came from the washtub, wiping her hands on her skirt. Several others came out of the house.</p>
   <p>The little boy remained at the foot of the steps. His hand was now in the hand of a buxom girl. Judging by Bossert's description, this would be his mother. Not much over nineteen, handsome, big breasted, full hipped. She was dressed in tight jeans and a boy's shirt, her bare feet stuck into sandals, and a hank of yellow hair hung down her back.</p>
   <p>Doc spoke to them all, introducing me as a friend from town. They were courteous, but reserved. "I want to talk to Sally," he said, and we moved closer to the steps. I tried not to look at the boy lest the glitter in my eye give me away. Doc was being so casual and hearty it hurt. I could feel a curious little prickle run over my skin as I got close to the child. It was partly excitement, partly the feeling that here was a being different from myself, another species. There was a dark bruise on the child's forehead, and I remembered that the others had beaten him. Was this otherness at the bottom of their resentment? Did they sense it without the need for blood samples and X-rays?</p>
   <p>Mutant. A strange word. A stranger thing to come upon here in these friendly familiar hills. The child stared at me, and the July sun turned cold on my back.</p>
   <p>Doc spoke to Sally, and she smiled. She had an honest, friendly smile. Her mouth was wide and full, frankly sensuous but without coquetry. She had big blue eyes, and her sunburned cheeks were flushed with health, and she looked as uncomplicated and warmly attractive as a summer meadow. I wondered what strange freak of genetics had made her the fountainhead of a totally new race.</p>
   <p>Doc said, "Is this the little boy you brought in to the hospital?"</p>
   <p>"Yes," she said. "But he's better now."</p>
   <p>Doc bent over and spoke to the boy. "Well," he said. "And what's your name, young man?"</p>
   <p>"Name's Billy," he answered, in a grave sweet treble that had a sound in it of bells being rung far off. "Billy Tate."</p>
   <p>The woman who had come from the washtub said with unconcealed dislike, "He ain't no Tate, whatever he might be."</p>
   <p>She had been introduced as Mrs. Tate, and was obviously the mother and grandmother of this numerous brood. She had lost most of her teeth and her gray-blonde hair stood out around her head in an untidy brush. Doc ignored her.</p>
   <p>"How do you do, Billy Tate," he said, "And where did you get that pretty red hair?"</p>
   <p>"From his daddy," said Mrs. Tate sharply. "Same place he got his sneaky-footed ways and them yellow eyes like a bad hound. I tell you, Doctor, if you see a man looks just like that child, you tell him to come back and get what belongs to him!"</p>
   <p>A corny but perfectly fitting counterpoint to her words, thunder crashed on Buckhorn's cloudy crest, like the ominous laughter of a god.</p>
   <p>Sally reached down suddenly and caught up the boy into her arms…</p>
   <p>The thunder quivered and died on the hot air. I stared at Doc and he stared at me, and Sally Tate screamed at her mother.</p>
   <p>"You keep your dirty mouth off my baby!"</p>
   <p>"That ain't no way to talk to Maw," said one of the older girls. "And anyway, she's right."</p>
   <p>"Oh," said Sally. "You think so, do you?" She turned to Doc, her cheeks all white now and her eyes blazing. "They set their young ones on my baby, Doctor, and you know why? They're jealous. They're just sick to their stomachs with it, because they all got big hunkety kids that can't do nothin' but eat, and big hunkety men that treat them like they was no better'n brood sows."</p>
   <p>She had reached her peak of fury so quickly that it was obvious this row had been going on for a long while, probably ever since the child was born.</p>
   <p>Possibly even before, judging by what she said then.</p>
   <p>"Jealous," she said to her sisters, showing her teeth. "Every last one of you was dancing up and down to catch his eye, but it was me he took to the hayloft. Me. And if he ever comes back he can have me again, for as often and as long as he wants me. And I won't hear no ill of him nor the baby!"</p>
   <p>I heard all this. I understood it. But not with all, or even most of my mind. That was busy with another thing, a thing it didn't want to grapple with at all and kept shying away from, only to be driven back shivering.</p>
   <p>Doc put it into words.</p>
   <p>"You mean," he said, to no one in particular, "the boy looks just like his father?"</p>
   <p>"Spit an' image," said Sally fondly, kissing the red curls that had that queer glint of silver in them. "Sure would like to see that man again, I don't care what they say. Doctor, I tell you, he was beautiful."</p>
   <p>"Handsome is as handsome does," said Mrs. Tate. "He was no good, and I knew it the minute I saw—"</p>
   <p>"Why, Maw," said Mr. Tate, "he had you eating out of his hand, with them nicey ways of his." He turned to Doc Callendar, laughing. "She'd a' gone off to the hayloft with him herself if he'd asked her, and that's a fact. Ain't it, Harry?"</p>
   <p>Harry said it was, and they all laughed.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Tate said furiously, "It'd become you men better to do something about getting some support for that brat from its father, instead of making fool jokes in front of strangers."</p>
   <p>"Seems like, when you bring it up," said Mr. Tate, "it would become us all not to wash our dirty linen for people who aren't rightly concerned." He said courteously to Doc, "Reckon you had a reason for coming here. Is there something I can do?"</p>
   <p>"Well—" said Doc uncertainly, and looked at the boy. "Just like his father, you say."</p>
   <p>And if that is so, I thought, how can he be a mutant? A mutant is something new, something different, alien from the parent stem. If he is the spit an' image outside, then build and coloring bred true. And if build and coloring bred true, probably blood-type and internal organs—</p>
   <p>Thunder boomed again on Buckhorn Mountain. And I thought, Well, and so his father is a mutant, too.</p>
   <p>But Doc said, "Who was this man, Sally? I know just about everybody in these hills, but I never saw anyone to answer that description."</p>
   <p>"His name was Bill," she said, "just like the boy's. His other name was Jones. Or he said it was."</p>
   <p>"He lied," said Mrs. Tate. "Wasn't Jones no more than mine is. We found that out."</p>
   <p>"How did he happen to come here?" asked Doc. "Where did he say he was from?"</p>
   <p>"He come here," Mrs. Tate said, "driving a truck for some appliance store, Grover's I think it was, in Newhale. Said the place was just new and was making a survey of TVs around here, and offering free service on them up to five dollars, just for goodwill. So I let him look at ours, and he fussed with it for almost an hour, and didn't charge me a cent. Worked real good afterward, too. That would 'a been the end of it, I guess, only Sally was under his feet all the time and he took a shine to her. Kept coming back, and coming back, and you see what happened."</p>
   <p>I said, "There isn't any Grover's store in Newhale. There never has been."</p>
   <p>"We found that out," said Mrs. Tate. "When we knew the baby was coming we tried to find Mr. Jones, but it seems he'd told us a big pack of lies."</p>
   <p>"He told me," Sally said dreamily, "where he come from."</p>
   <p>Doc said eagerly, "Where?"</p>
   <p>Twisting her mouth to shape the unfamiliar sounds, Sally said, "Hrylliannu."</p>
   <p>Doc's eyes opened wide. "Where the hell is that?"</p>
   <p>"Ain't no place," said Mrs. Tate. "Even the schoolteacher couldn't find it in the atlas. It's only another of his lies."</p>
   <p>But Sally murmured again, "Hrylliannu. Way he said it, it sounded like the most beautiful place in the world."</p>
   <p>The stormcloud over Buckhorn was spreading out. Its edges dimmed the sun. Lightning flicked and flared and the thunder rolled. I said, "Could I take a look at your television?"</p>
   <p>"Why," said' Mrs. Tate, "I guess so. But don't you disturb it, now. Whatever else he done, he fixed that TV good."</p>
   <p>"I won't disturb it," I said. I went up the sagging steps past the old man and the fat old dog. I went into the cluttered livingroom, where the springs were coming out of the sofa and there was no rug on the floor, and six kids apparently slept in the old brass bed in the corner. The television set was maybe four years old, but it was the best and biggest made that year. It formed a sort of shrine at one end of the room, with a piece of red cloth laid over its top.</p>
   <p>I took the back off and looked in. I don't know what I expected to see. It just seemed odd to me that a man would go to all the trouble of faking up a truck and tinkering with television sets for nothing. And apparently he hadn't. What I did see I didn't understand, but even to my inexpert eye it was obvious that Mr. Jones had done something quite peculiar to the wiring inside.</p>
   <p>A totally unfamiliar component roosted on the side cf the case, a little gadget not much bigger than my two thumbnails.</p>
   <p>I replaced the back and turned the set on. As Mrs. Tate said, it worked real good. Better than it had any business to. I got a peculiar hunch that Mr. Jones had planned it that way, so that no other serviceman would have to be called. I got the hunch that that component was important somehow to Mr. Jones.</p>
   <p>I wondered how many other such components he had put in television sets in this area, and what they were for.</p>
   <p>I turned off the set and went outside. Doc was still talking to Sally.</p>
   <p>"…some further tests he wants to make," I heard him say. "I can take you and Billy back right now…"</p>
   <p>Sally looked doubtful and was about to speak. But the decision was made for her. The boy cried out wildly, "No! No!" With the frantic strength of a young animal he twisted out of his mother's arms, dropped to the ground, and sped away into the brush so swiftly that nobody had a chance even to grab for him.</p>
   <p>Sally smiled. "All them shiny machines and the funny smells frightened him," she said. "He don't want to go back. Isn't anything wrong with him, is there? The other doctor said he was all right."</p>
   <p>"No," said Doc reluctantly. "Just something about the X-rays he wanted to check on. It could be important for the future. Tell you what, Sally. You talk to the boy, and I'll come back in a day or two."</p>
   <p>"Well," she said. "All right."</p>
   <p>Doc hesitated, and then said, "Would you want me to speak to the sheriff about finding this man? If that's his child he should pay something for its support."</p>
   <p>A wistful look came into her eyes. "I always thought maybe if he knew about the baby—"</p>
   <p>Mrs. Tate didn't give her time to finish. "Yes, indeed," she said. "You speak to the sheriff. Time somebody did something about this, 'fore that brat's a man grown himself."</p>
   <p>"Well," said Doc, "we can try."</p>
   <p>He gave a last baffled glance at the woods where the boy had disappeared, and then we said goodbye and got into the station wagon and drove away. The sky was dark overhead now, and the air was heavy with the smell of rain.</p>
   <p>"What do you think?" I said finally.</p>
   <p>Doc shook his head. "I'm damned if I know. Apparently the external characteristics bred true. If the others did—"</p>
   <p>"Then the father must be a mutant too. We just push it back one generation."</p>
   <p>"That's the simplest explanation," Doc said.</p>
   <p>"Is there any other?"</p>
   <p>Doc didn't answer that. We passed through Possum Creek, and it began to rain.</p>
   <p>"What about the television set?" he asked.</p>
   <p>I told him. "But you'd have to have Jud or one of the boys from Newhale Appliance look at it, to say what it was."</p>
   <p>"It smells," said Doc. "It stinks, right out loud."</p>
   <p>The bolt of lightning came so quickly and hit so close that I wasn't conscious of anything but a great flare of livid green. Doc yelled. The station wagon slewed on the road that now had a thin film of mud over it, and I saw trees rushing at us, their tops bent by a sudden wind so that they seemed to be literally leaping forward. There was no thunder. I remembered that, I don't know why. The station wagon tipped over and hit the trees. There was a crash. The door flew open and I fell out through a wet whipping tangle of branches and on down to the steep-tilted ground below. I kept on falling, right down the slope, until a gully pocket caught and held me. I lay there dazed, staring up at the station wagon that now hung over my head. I saw Doc's legs come out of it, out the open door. He was all right. He was letting himself down to the ground. And then the lightning came again.</p>
   <p>It swallowed the station wagon and the trees and Doc in a ball of green fire, and when it went away the trees were scorched and the paint was blistered on the wrecked car, and Doc was rolling over and over down the slope, very slowly, as if he was tired and did not want to hurry. He came to rest not three feet away from me. His hair and his clothes were smoldering, but he wasn't worrying about it. He wasn't worrying about anything, any more. And for the second time there had not been any thunder, close at hand where the lightning was.</p>
   <p>The rain came down on Doc in heavy sheets, and put the smoldering fire out.</p>
   <p>Jim Bossert had just come from posting Doc Callendar's body. For the first time I found myself almost liking him, he looked so sick and beat-out. I pushed the bottle toward him, and he drank out of it and then lighted a cigarette and just sat there shaking.</p>
   <p>"It was lightning," he said. "No doubt at all."</p>
   <p>Ed Berts, the sheriff, said, "Hank still insists there was something screwy about it."</p>
   <p>Bossert shook his head at me. "Lightning."</p>
   <p>"Or a heavy electric charge," I said. "That comes to the same thing, doesn't it?"</p>
   <p>"But you saw it hit, Hank."</p>
   <p>"Twice," I said. "Twice."</p>
   <p>We were in Bossert's office at the hospital. It was late in the afternoon, getting on for supper time. I reached for the bottle again, and Ed said quietly,</p>
   <p>"Lightning does do that, you know. In spite of the old saying."</p>
   <p>"The first time, it missed," I said. "Just. Second time it didn't. If I hadn't been thrown clear I'd be dead too. And there wasn't any thunder."</p>
   <p>"You were dazed," Bossert said. "The first shock stunned you."</p>
   <p>"It was green," I said.</p>
   <p>"Fireballs often are."</p>
   <p>"But not lightning."</p>
   <p>"Atmospheric freak." Ed turned to Jim Bossert. "Give him something and send him home."</p>
   <p>Bossert nodded and got up, but I said, "No. I've got to write up a piece on Doc for tomorrow's paper. See you."</p>
   <p>I didn't want to talk any more. I went out and got my car and drove back to town. I felt funny. Hollow, cold, with a veil over my brain so I couldn't see anything clearly or think about anything clearly. I stopped at the store and bought another bottle to see me through the night, and a feeling of cold evil was in me, and I thought of green, silent lightning, and little gimcracks that didn't belong in a television set, and the grave wise face of a child who was not quite human. The face wavered and became the face of a man. A man from Hrylliannu.</p>
   <p>I drove home, to the old house where nobody lives now but me. I wrote my story about Doc, and when I was through it was dark and the bottle was nearly empty. I went to bed.</p>
   <p>I dreamed Doc Callendar called me on the phone and said, "I've found him but you'll have to hurry." And I said, "But you're dead. Don't call me, Doc, please don't." But the phone kept ringing and ringing, and after a while I woke part way up and it really was ringing. It was two-forty-nine A.M.</p>
   <p>It was Ed Berts. "Fire up at the hospital, Hank. I thought you'd want to know. The south wing. Gotta go now."</p>
   <p>He hung up and I began to put clothes on the leaden dummy that was me. The south wing, I thought, and sirens went whooping up Goat Hill. The south wing. That's where X-ray is. That's where the pictures of the boy's insides are on file.</p>
   <p>What a curious coincidence, I thought.</p>
   <p>I drove after the sirens up Goat Hill, through the clear cool night with half a moon shining silver on the ridges, and Buckhorn standing calm and serene against the stars, thinking the lofty thoughts that seem to be reserved for mountains.</p>
   <p>The south wing of the hospital burned brightly, a very pretty orange color against the night.</p>
   <p>I pulled off the road and parked well below the center of activity and started to walk the rest of the way. Patients were being evacuated from the main building. People ran with things in their hands. Firemen yelled and wrestled with hoses and streams of water arced over the flames. I didn't think they were going to save the south wing. I thought they would be doing well to save the hospital.</p>
   <p>Another unit of the fire department came hooting and clanging up the road behind me. I stepped off the shoulder and as I did so I looked down to be sure of my footing. A flicker of movement on the slope about ten feet below caught my eye. Dimly, in the reflected glow of the fire, I saw the girl.</p>
   <p>She was slim and light as a gazelle, treading her furtive way among the trees. Her hair was short and curled close to her head. In that light it was merely dark, but I knew it would be red in the sunshine, with glints of silver in it. She saw me or heard me, and she stopped for a second or two, startled, looking up. Her eyes shone like two coppery sparks, as the eyes of an animal shine, weird in the pale oval of her face. Then she turned and ran.</p>
   <p>I went after her. She ran fast, and I was in lousy shape. But I was thinking about Doc.</p>
   <p>I caught her.</p>
   <p>It was dark all around us under the trees, but the firelight and the moonlight shone together into the clearing where we were. She didn't struggle or fight me. She turned around kind of light and stiff to face me, holding herself away from me as much as she could with my hands gripping her arms.</p>
   <p>"What do you want with me?" she said, in a breathless little voice. It was accented, and sweet as a bird's. "Let me go."</p>
   <p>I said, "What relation are you to the boy?"</p>
   <p>That startled her. I saw her eyes widen, and then she turned her head and looked toward the darkness under the trees. "Please let me go," she said, and I thought that some new fear had come to her.</p>
   <p>I shook her, feeling her small arms under my hands, wanting to break them, wanting to torture her because of Doc. "How was Doc killed?" I asked her. "Tell me. Who did it, and how?"</p>
   <p>She stared at me. "Doc?" she repeated. "I do not understand." Now she began to struggle. "Let me go! You hurt me."</p>
   <p>"The green lightning," I said. "A man was killed by it this morning. My friend. I want to know about it."</p>
   <p>"Killed?" she whispered. "Oh, no. No one has been killed."</p>
   <p>"And you set that fire in the hospital, didn't you? Why? Why were those films such a threat to you? Who are you? Where—"</p>
   <p>"Hush," she said. "Listen."</p>
   <p>I listened. There were sounds, soft and stealthy, moving up the slope toward us.</p>
   <p>"They're looking for me," she whispered. "Please let me go. I dont know about your friend, and the fire was—necessary. I don't want anyone hurt, and if they find you like this—"</p>
   <p>I dragged her back into the shadows underneath the trees. There was a huge old maple there with a gnarly trunk. We stood behind it, and now I had my arm around her waist and her head pressed back against my shoulder, and my right hand over her mouth.</p>
   <p>"Where do you come from?" I asked her, with my mouth close to her ear. "Where is Hrylliannu?"</p>
   <p>Her body stiffened. It was a nice body, very much like the boy's in some ways, delicately made but strong, and with superb coordination. In other ways it was not like the boy's at all. I was thinking of her as an enemy, but it was impossible not to think of her as a woman, too.</p>
   <p>She said, her voice muffled under my hand, "Where did you hear that name?"</p>
   <p>"Never mind," I said. "Just answer me."</p>
   <p>She wouldn't.</p>
   <p>"Where do you live now? Somewhere near here?"</p>
   <p>She only strained to get away.</p>
   <p>"All right," I said. "We'll go now. Back up to the hospital. The sheriff wants to see you."</p>
   <p>I started to drag her away up the hill, and then two men came into the light of the clearing.</p>
   <p>One was slender and curlyheaded in that particular way I was beginning to know. He looked pleasantly excited, pleasantly stimulated, as though by a game in which he found enjoyment. His eyes picked up the fitful glow of the fire and shone eerily, as the girl's had.</p>
   <p>The other man was a perfectly ordinary type. He was dark and heavy-set and tall, and his khaki pants sagged under his belly. His face was neither excited nor pleasant It was obvious that to him this was no game. He carried a heavy automatic, and I thought he was perfectly prepared to use it.</p>
   <p>I was afraid of him.</p>
   <p>"…to send a dame, anyway," he was saying.</p>
   <p>"That's your prejudice speaking," said the curly-haired man. "She was the only one to send." He gestured toward the flames. "How can you doubt it?"</p>
   <p>"She's been caught."</p>
   <p>"Not Vadi." He began to call softly. "Vadi? Vadi!"</p>
   <p>The girl's lips moved under my hand. I bent to hear, and she said in the faint ghost of a whisper:</p>
   <p>"If you want to live, let me go to them."</p>
   <p>The big dark man said grimly, "She's been caught. We'd better do something about it, and do it quick."</p>
   <p>He started across the clearing.</p>
   <p>The girl's lips shaped one word. "Please!"</p>
   <p>The dark man came with his big gun, and the curly-headed one came a little behind him, walking as a stalking cat walks, soft and springy on its toes. If I dragged the girl away they would hear me. If I stayed where I was, they would walk right onto me. Either way, I thought, I would pretty surely go to join Doc on the cold marble.</p>
   <p>I let the girl go.</p>
   <p>She ran out toward them. I stood stark and frozen behind the maple tree, waiting for her to turn and say the word that would betray me.</p>
   <p>She didn't turn, and she didn't say the word, The curly-headed man put his arms around her and they talked rapidly for perhaps half a minute, and I heard her tell the dark man that she had only waited to be sure they would not be able to put the fire out too soon. Then all three turned and went quickly away among the dark trees.</p>
   <p>I stayed where I was for a minute, breathing hard, trying to think. Then I went hunting for the sheriff.</p>
   <p>By the time I found Ed Betts, of course, it was already too late. But he sent a car out anyway. They didn't find a trace of anyone on the road who answered the descriptions I gave.</p>
   <p>Ed looked at me closely in the light of the dying fire, which they had finally succeeded in bringing under control. "Don't get sore at me now, Hank," he said. "But are you real sure you saw these people?"</p>
   <p>"I'm sure," I said. I could still, if I shut my eyes and thought about it, feel the girl's body in my arms. "Her name was Vadi. Now I want to talk to Croft."</p>
   <p>Croft was the Fire Marshal. I watched the boys pouring water on what was left of the south wing, which was nothing more than a pile of hot embers with some pieces of wall standing near it. Jim Bossert joined us, looking exhausted and grimy. He was too tired even to curse. He just wailed a little about the loss of all his fine X-ray equipment, and all his records.</p>
   <p>"I met the girl who did it," I said. "Ed doesn't believe me."</p>
   <p>"Girl?" said Bossert, staring.</p>
   <p>"Girl. Apparently an expert at this sort of thing." I wondered what the curly-haired man was to her. "Was anybody hurt?"</p>
   <p>"By the grace of God," said Bossert, "no."</p>
   <p>"How did it start?"</p>
   <p>"I don't know. All of a sudden I woke up and every window in the south wing was spouting flame like a volcano."</p>
   <p>I glanced at Ed, who shrugged. "Could have been a short in that high-voltage equipment."</p>
   <p>Bossert said, "What kind of a girl? A lunatic?"</p>
   <p>"Another one like the boy. There was a man with her, maybe the boy's father, I don't know. The third one was just a man. Mean looking bastard with a gun. She said the fire was necessary."</p>
   <p>"All this, just to get rid of some films?"</p>
   <p>"It must be important to them," I said. "They already killed Doc. They tried to kill me. What's a fire?"</p>
   <p>Ed Berts swore, his face twisted between unbelief and worry. Then Croft came up. Ed asked him, "What started the fire?"</p>
   <p>Croft shook his head. "Too early to tell yet. Have to wait till things cool down. But I'll lay you any odds you like it was started by chemicals."</p>
   <p>"Deliberately?"</p>
   <p>"Could be," said Croft, and went away again.</p>
   <p>I looked at the sky. It was almost dawn, that beautiful bleak time when the sky is neither dark nor light and the mountains are cut from black cardboard, without perspective. I said, "I'm going up to the Tates'. I'm worried about the boy."</p>
   <p>"All right," said Ed quickly, "I'll go with you. In my car. We'll stop in town and pick up Jud. I want him to see that TV."</p>
   <p>"The hell with Jud," I said. "I'm in a hurry." And suddenly I was. Suddenly I was terribly afraid for that grave-faced child who was obviously the unwitting key to some secret that was important enough to justify arson and murder to those who wanted to keep it.</p>
   <p>Ed hung right behind me. He practically shoved me into his car. It had COUNTY SHERIFF painted on its door, and I thought of Doc's station wagon with its COUNTY HEALTH SERVICE, and it seemed like a poor omen but there was nothing I could do about it.</p>
   <p>There was nothing I could do about stopping for Jud Spofford, either. Ed went in and routed him out of bed, taking the car keys with him. I sat smoking and looking up at Tunkhannock Ridge, watching it brighten to gold at the crest as the sun came up. Finally Jud came out grumbling and climbed in the back seat, a tall lanky young fellow in a blue coverall with Newhale Electric Appliance Co. embroidered in red on the pocket. His little wife watched from the doorway, holding her pink wrapper together.</p>
   <p>We went away up Tunkhannock Ridge. There was still a black smudge of smoke above the hospital on Goat Hill. The sky over Buckhorn Mountain was clear and bright.</p>
   <p>Sally Tate and her boy were already gone.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Tate told us about it, while we sat on the lumpy sofa in the living room and the fat old dog watched us through the screen door, growling. Sally's sisters, or some of them at least, were in the kitchen listening.</p>
   <p>"Never was so surprised at anything in my life," said Mrs. Tate. "Pa had just gone out to the barn with Harry and J.P.—them's the two oldest girls' husbands, you know. I and the girls was washing up after breakfast, and I heard this car drive in. Sure enough it was him. I went out on the stoop—"</p>
   <p>"What kind of a car?" asked Ed.</p>
   <p>"Same panel truck he was driving before, only the name was painted out. Kind of a dirty blue all over. 'Well,' I says, 'I never expected to see your face around here again!', I says, and he says—"</p>
   <p>Boiled down to reasonable length, the man had said that he had always intended to come back for Sally, and that if he had known about the boy he would have come much sooner. He had been away, he said, on business, and had only just got back and heard about Sally bringing the child in to the hospital, and knew that it must be his. He had gone up to the house, and Sally had come running out into his arms, her face all shining. Then they went in together to see the boy, and Bill Jones had fondled him and called him Son, and the boy had watched him sleepily and without affection.</p>
   <p>"They talked together for a while, private," said Mrs. Tate, "and then Sally come and said he was going to take her away and marry her and make the boy legal, and would I help her pack. And I did, and they went away together, the three of 'em. Sally didn't know when she'd be back."</p>
   <p>She shook her head, smoothing her hair with knotted fingers. "I just don't know," she said. "I just don't know."</p>
   <p>"What?" I asked her. "Was there something wrong?" I knew there was, but I wanted to hear what she had to say.</p>
   <p>"Nothing you could lay your hand to," she said. "And Sally was so happy. She was just fit to burst. And he was real pleasant, real polite to me and Pa. We asked him about all them lies he told, and he said they wasn't lies at all. He said the man he was working for did plan to open a store in Newhale, but then he got sick and the plan fell through. He said his name was Bill Jones, and showed us some cards and things to prove it. And he said Sally just misunderstood the name of the place he come from because he give it the old Spanish pronunciation."</p>
   <p>"What did he say it was really?" Ed asked, and she looked surprised.</p>
   <p>"Now I think of it, I guess he didn't say."</p>
   <p>"Well, where's he going to live, with Sally?"</p>
   <p>"He isn't settled yet. He's got two or three prospects, different places. She was so happy," said Mrs. Tate, "and I ought to be too, 'cause Lord knows I've wished often enough he would come back and get that peaky brat of his, and Sally too if she was minded. But I ain't. I ain't happy at all, and I don't know why."</p>
   <p>"Natural reaction," said Ed Betts heartily. "You miss your daughter, and probably the boy too, more than you know."</p>
   <p>"I've had daughters married before. It was something about this man. Something—" Mrs. Tate hesitated a long time, searching for a word. "Queer," she said at last. "Wrong. I couldn't tell you what. Like the boy, only more so. The boy has Sally in him. This one—" She made a gesture with her hands. "Oh, well I expect I'm just looking for trouble."</p>
   <p>"I expect so, Mrs. Tate," said Ed, "but you be sure and get in touch with me if you don't hear from Sally in a reasonable time. And now I'd like this young man to look at your TV."</p>
   <p>Jud, who had been sitting stiff and uncomfortable during the talking, jumped up and practically ran to the set. Mrs. Tate started to protest, but Ed said firmly, "This may be important, Mrs. Tate. Jud's a good serviceman, he won't upset anything."</p>
   <p>"I hope not," she said. "It does run real good."</p>
   <p>Jud turned it on and watched it for a minute. "It sure does," he said. "And in this location, too."</p>
   <p>He took the back off and looked inside. After a minute he let go a long low whistle.</p>
   <p>"What is it?" said Ed, going closer.</p>
   <p>"Damnedest thing," said Jud. "Look at that wiring. He's loused up the circuits, all right—and there's a couple tubes in there like I never saw before." He was getting excited. "I'd have to tear the whole thing down to see what he's really done, but somehow he's boosted the power and the sensitivity way up. The guy must be a wizard."</p>
   <p>Mrs. Tate said loudly, "You ain't tearing anything down, young man. You just leave it like it is."</p>
   <p>I said, "What about that dingus on the side?"</p>
   <p>"Frankly," said Jud, "that stops me. It's got a wire to it, but it don't seem to hitch up anywhere in the set."</p>
   <p>He turned the set off and began to poke gently around. "See here, this little hairline wire that comes down and bypasses the whole chassis? It cuts in here on the live line, so it draws power whether the set's on or not. But I don't see how it can have anything to do with the set operating."</p>
   <p>"Well, take it out," said Ed. "We'll take it down to the shop and see whether we can make anything of it."</p>
   <p>"Okay," said Jud, ignoring Mrs. Tate's cry of protest. He reached in and for the first time actually touched the enigmatic little unit, feeling for what held it to the side of the case.</p>
   <p>There was a sharp pop and a small bright flare, and Jud leaped back with a howl. He put his scorched fingers in his mouth and his eyes watered. Mrs. Tate cried, "Now, you've done it, you've ruined my TV!" There was a smell of burning on the air. The girls came running out of the kitchen and the old dog barked and clawed the screen.</p>
   <p>One of the girls said, "What happened?"</p>
   <p>"I don't know," Jud said. "The goddamned thing just popped like a bomb when I touched it."</p>
   <p>There was a drift of something gray—ash or dust—and that was all. Even the hairline wire was consumed.</p>
   <p>"It looks," I said, "as though Mr. Jones didn't want anybody else to look over his technological achievements."</p>
   <p>Ed grunted. He looked puzzled and irresolute. "Hurt the set any?" he asked.</p>
   <p>"Dunno," said Jud, and turned it on.</p>
   <p>It ran as perfectly as before.</p>
   <p>"Well," said Mrs. Tate, "thank goodness."</p>
   <p>"Yeah," said Ed. "I guess that's all, then. What do you say, Hank? We might as well go."</p>
   <p>I said we might as well. We climbed back into Ed's car and started—the second time for me—back down Tunkhannock Ridge.</p>
   <p>Jud was still sucking his fingers. He wondered out loud if the funny-looking tubes in the set would explode the same way if you touched them, and I said probably. Ed didn't say anything. He was frowning deeply. I asked him what he thought about it.</p>
   <p>"I'm trying to figure the angle," he said. "This Bill Jones. What does he get out of it? What does he make? On the television gag, I mean. People usually want to get paid for work like that."</p>
   <p>Jud offered the opinion that the man was a nut. "One of these crazy guys like in the movies, always inventing things that make trouble. But I sure would like to know what he done to that set."</p>
   <p>"Well," said Ed, "I can't see what more we can do. He did come back for the girl, and apart from that he hasn't broken any laws."</p>
   <p>"Hasn't he?" I said, looking out the window. We were coming to the place where Doc had died. There was no sign of a storm today. Everything was bright, serene, peaceful. But I could feel the cold feeling of being watched. Someone, somewhere, knew me. He watched where I went and what I did, and decided whether or not to send the green lightning to slay me. It was a revelation, like the moments you have as a young child when you become acutely conscious of God. I began to shake. I wanted to crawl down in the back seat and hide. Instead I sat where I was and tried to keep the naked terror from showing too much. And I watched the sky. And nothing happened.</p>
   <p>Ed Betts didn't mention it, but he began to drive faster and faster until I thought we weren't going to need any green lightning. He didn't slow down until we hit the valley. I think he would have been glad to get rid of me, but he had to haul me all the way back up Goat Hill to get my car. When he did let me off, he said gruffly,</p>
   <p>"I'm not going to listen to you again till you've had a good twelve hours' sleep. And I need some myself. So long."</p>
   <p>I went home, but I didn't sleep. Not right away. I told my assistant and right-hand man, Joe Streckfoos, that the paper was all his today, and then I got on the phone. I drove the local exchange crazy, but by about five o'clock that afternoon I had the information I wanted.</p>
   <p>I had started with a map of the area on my desk. Not just Newhale, but the whole area, with Buckhorn Mountain roughly at the center and showing the hills and valleys around its northern periphery. By five o'clock the map showed a series of red pencil dots. If you connected them together with a line they formed a sprawling, irregular, but unbroken circle drawn around Buckhorn, never exceeding a certain number of miles in distance from the peak.</p>
   <p>Every pencil dot represented a television set that had within the last three years been serviced by a red-haired man—for free.</p>
   <p>I looked at the map for a long time, and then I went out in the yard and looked up at Buckhorn. It seemed to me to stand very high, higher than I remembered. From flank to crest the green unbroken forest covered it. In the winter-time men hunted there for bear and deer, and I knew there were a few hunting lodges, hardly more than shacks, on its lower slopes. These were not used in summer, and apart from the hunters no one ever bothered to climb those almost perpendicular sides, hanging onto the trees as onto a ladder, up to the fog and storm that plagued the summit.</p>
   <p>There were clouds there now. It almost seemed that Buckhorn pulled them down over his head like a cowl, until the gray trailing edges hid him almost to his feet. I shivered and went inside and shut the door. I cleaned my automatic and put in a full clip. I made a sandwich and drank the last couple of drinks in last night's bottle. I laid out my boots and my rough-country pants and a khaki shirt. I set the alarm. It was still broad daylight. I went to bed.</p>
   <p>The alarm woke me at eleven-thirty. I did not turn on any lamps. I don't know why, except that I still had that naked feeling of being watched. Light enough came to me anyhow from the intermittent sulfurous flares in the sky. There was a low mutter of thunder in the west. I put the automatic in a shoulder holster under my shirt, not to hide it but because it was out of the way there. When I was dressed I went downstairs and out the back door, heading for the garage.</p>
   <p>It was quiet, the way a little town can be quiet at night. I could hear the stream going over the stones, and the million little songs of the crickets, the peepers, and the frogs were almost stridently loud.</p>
   <p>Then they began to stop. The frogs first, in the marshy places beside the creek. Then the crickets and the peepers. I stopped too, in the black dark beside a clump of rhododendrons my mother used to be almost tiresomely proud of. My skin turned cold and the hair bristled on the back of my neck and I heard soft padding footsteps and softer breathing on the heavy air.</p>
   <p>Two people had waded the creek and come up into my yard.</p>
   <p>There was a flare and a grumble in the sky and I saw them close by, standing on the grass, looking up at the unlighted house.</p>
   <p>One of them was the girl Vadi, and she carried something in her hands. The other was the heavy-set dark man with the gun.</p>
   <p>"It's okay," he told her. "He's sleeping. Get busy."</p>
   <p>I slid the automatic into my palm and opened my mouth to speak, and then I heard her say:</p>
   <p>"You won't give him a chance to get out?"</p>
   <p>Her tone said she knew the answer to that one before she asked it. But he said with furious sarcasm:</p>
   <p>"Why certainly, and then you can call the sheriff and explain why you burned the house down. And the hospital. Christ. I told Arnek you weren't to be trusted." He gave her a rough shove. "Get with it."</p>
   <p>Vadi walked five careful paces away from him. Then very swiftly she threw away, in two different directions, whatever it was she carried. I heard the two things fall, rustling among grass and branches where it might take hours to find them even by daylight. She spun around. "Now," she said in a harsh defiant voice, "what are you going to do?"</p>
   <p>There was a moment of absolute silence, so full of murder that the far-off lightning seemed feeble by comparison. Then he said:</p>
   <p>"All right, let's get out of here."</p>
   <p>She moved to join him, and he waited until she was quite close to him. Then he hit her. She made a small bleating sound and fell down. He started to kick her, and then I jumped out and hit him over the ear with the flat of the automatic. It was his turn to fall down.</p>
   <p>Vadi got up on her hands and knees. She stared at me, sobbing a little with rage and pain. Blood was running from the corner of her mouth. I took the man's gun and threw it far off and it splashed in the creek. Then I got down beside the girl.</p>
   <p>"Here," I said. "Have my handkerchief."</p>
   <p>She took it and held it to her mouth. "You were outside here all the time," she said. She sounded almost angry.</p>
   <p>"It just happened that way. I still owe you thanks for my life. And my house. Though you weren't so tender about the hospital."</p>
   <p>"There was no one to be killed there. I made sure. A building one can always rebuild, but a life is different."</p>
   <p>She looked at the unconscious man. Her eyes burned with that catlike brilliance in the lightning flares.</p>
   <p>"I could kill him," she said, "with pleasure."</p>
   <p>"Who is he?"</p>
   <p>"My brother's partner." She glanced toward Buck-horn and the light went out of her eyes. Her head became bowed.</p>
   <p>"Your brother sent you to kill me?"</p>
   <p>"He didn't say—"</p>
   <p>"But you knew."</p>
   <p>"When Marlin came with me I knew."</p>
   <p>She had begun to tremble.</p>
   <p>"Do you make a career of arson?"</p>
   <p>"Arson? Oh. The setting of fires. No. I am a chemist. And I wish I—"</p>
   <p>She caught herself fiercely and would not finish.</p>
   <p>I said, "Those things are listening devices, then."</p>
   <p>She had to ask me what I meant. Her mind was busy with some thorny darkness of its own.</p>
   <p>"The little gadgets your brother put in the television sets," I said. "I figured that's what they were when I saw how they were placed. A string of sentry posts all around the center of operations, little ears to catch every word of gossip, because if any of the local people get suspicious they're bound to talk about it and so give warning. He heard my calls this afternoon, didn't he? That's why he sent you. And he heard Doc and me at the Tates'. That's why—"</p>
   <p>Moving with that uncanny swiftness of hers, she rose and ran away from me. It was like before. She ran fast, and I ran after her. She went splashing through the shallow stream and the water flew back against me, wetting my face, spattering my clothes. On the far bank I caught her, as I had before. But this time she fought me.</p>
   <p>"Let me go," she said, and beat her hands against me. "Do you know what I've done for you? I've asked for the knife for myself. Let me go, you clumsy fool—"</p>
   <p>I held her tighter. Her soft curls pressed against my cheek. Her body strove against me, and it was not soft but excitingly strong.</p>
   <p>"—before I regret it," she said, and I kissed her.</p>
   <p>It was strange, what happened then.</p>
   <p>I've kissed girls who didn't want to be kissed, and I've kissed girls who didn't like me particularly. I've kissed a couple of the touch-me-not kind who shrink from any sort of physical contact. I've had my face slapped. But I never had a girl withdraw from me the way she did. It was like something closing, folding up, shutting every avenue of contact, and yet she never moved. In fact she had stopped moving entirely. She just stood with my arms around her and my lips on hers, and kind of a coldness came out of her, a rejection so total I couldn't even get mad. I was shocked, and very much puzzled, but you can't get mad at a thing that isn't personal. This was too deep for that. And suddenly I thought of the boy.</p>
   <p>"A different breed," I said. "Worlds apart. Is that it?"</p>
   <p>"Yes," she said quietly. "Worlds apart."</p>
   <p>And the coldness spread through me. I stood on the bank of the stream in the warm night, the bank where I had stood ten thousand times before, boy and man, and saw the strange shining of her eyes, and I was more than cold, I was afraid. I stepped back away from her, still holding her but in a different way.</p>
   <p>"It wasn't like this," I said, "between your brother and Sally Tate."</p>
   <p>The girl-thing said, "My brother Arnek is a corrupt man."</p>
   <p>"Vadi," I said. "Where is Hrylliannu?"</p>
   <p>The girl-thing looked past my shoulder and said, "Marlin is running away."</p>
   <p>I looked too, and it was so. The big man's head was harder than I had thought. He had got up, and I saw him blundering rapidly away along the side of my house, heading for the street.</p>
   <p>"Well," I said, "he's gone now. You must have come in a car, didn't you?"</p>
   <p>She nodded.</p>
   <p>"Good," I said. "It won't be challenged as soon as mine. We'll take it."</p>
   <p>"Where are you going?" she asked, catching her breath sharply.</p>
   <p>"Where I was going when you stopped me. Up Buckhorn."</p>
   <p>"Oh no," she said. "No, you can't, you mustn't." She was human again, and afraid. "I saved your life, isn't that enough for you? You'll never live to climb Buckhorn and neither will I if—"</p>
   <p>"Did Sally and the boy live to climb it?" I asked her, and she hung her head and nodded. "Then you'll see to it that we do."</p>
   <p>"But tonight!" she said in a panic. "Not tonight!"</p>
   <p>"What's so special about tonight?" She didn't answer, and I shook her. "What's going on up there?"</p>
   <p>She didn't answer that, either. She said with sudden fierceness, "All right, then, come on. Climb Buckhorn and see. And when you're dying, remember that I tried to stop you."</p>
   <p>She didn't speak again. She led me without protest to the car parked on the dirt road. It was a panel truck. By day it would have been a dirty blue.</p>
   <p>"He's going to kill them, isn't he?" I said. "He killed Doc. You admit he wants to kill me. What's going to save Sally and the child?"</p>
   <p>"You torture me," she said. "This is a world of torture. Go on. Go on, and get it done."</p>
   <p>I started the panel truck. Like the television set, it worked better than it had any business to. It fled with uncanny strength and swiftness over the dirt roads toward Buckhorn, soft-sprung as a cloud, silent as a dream.</p>
   <p>"It's a pity," I said. "Your brother has considerable genius."</p>
   <p>She laughed. A bitter laugh. "He couldn't pass his second year of technical training. That's why he's here."</p>
   <p>She looked at Buckhorn as though she hated the mountain, and Buckhorn, invisible behind a curtain of storm, answered her look with a sullen curse, spoken in thunder.</p>
   <p>I stopped at the last gas station on the road and honked the owner out of bed and told him to call Sheriff Betts and tell him where I'd gone. I didn't dare do it myself for fear Vadi would get away from me. The man was very resentful about being waked up. I hoped he would not take out his resentment by forgetting to call.</p>
   <p>"You're pretty close to Buckhorn," I told him. "The neck you save may be your own."</p>
   <p>I left him to ponder that, racing on toward the dark mountain in that damned queer car that made me feel like a character in one of my own bad dreams, with the girl beside me—the damned queer girl who was not quite human.</p>
   <p>The road dropped behind us. We began to climb the knees of the mountain. Vadi told me where to turn, and the road became a track, and the track ended in the thick woods beside a rickety little lodge the size of a piano-box, with a garage behind it. The garage only looked rickety. The headlights showed up new and sturdy timbers on the inside.</p>
   <p>I cut the motor and the lights and reached for the handbrake. Vadi must have been set on a hair-trigger waiting for that moment. I heard her move and there was a snap as though she had pulled something from a clip underneath the dashboard. The door on her side banged open.</p>
   <p>I shouted to her to stop and sprang out of the truck to catch her. But she was already out of the garage, and she was waiting for me. Just as I came through the door there was a bolt of lightning, bright green, small and close at hand. I saw it coming. I saw her dimly in the backflash and knew that in some way she had made the lightning with a thing she held in her hand. Then it hit me and that was all.</p>
   <p>When I came to I was all alone and the rain was falling on me just the way it had on Doc…</p>
   <p>But I wasn't dead.</p>
   <p>I crawled around and finally managed to get up, feeling heavy and disjointed. My legs and arms flopped around as though the coordinating controls had been burned out. I stood inside the garage out of the rain, rubbing my numb joints and thinking.</p>
   <p>All the steam had gone out of me. I didn't want to climb Buckhorn Mountain any more. It looked awfully black up there, and awfully lonesome, and God alone knew what was going on under the veil of cloud and storm that hid it. The lightning flashes—real sky-made lightning—showed me the dripping trees going right up into nothing, with the wind thrashing them, and then the following thunder cracked my eardrums. The rain hissed, and I thought, it's crazy for one man to go up there alone.</p>
   <p>Then I thought about Sally Tate and the little redheaded kid, and I thought how Ed Betts might already be up there somewhere, plowing his way through the woods looking for me. I didn't know how long I'd been out.</p>
   <p>I made sure I still had my gun, and I did have. I wished I had a drink, but that was hopeless. So I started out. I didn't go straight up the mountain. I figured the girl would have had time to find her brother and give him warning, and that he might be looking for me to come that way. I angled off to the east, where I remembered a ravine that might give me some cover. I'd been up Buckhorn before, but only by daylight, with snow on the ground and a couple of friends with me, and not looking for anything more sinister than a bear.</p>
   <p>I climbed the steep flank of the mountain, leaning almost into it, worming and floundering and pulling my way between the trees. The rain fell and soaked me. The thunder was a monstrous presence, and the lightning was a great torch that somebody kept tossing back and forth so that sometimes you could see every vein of every leaf on the tree you were fighting with, and sometimes it was so dark that you knew the sun and stars hadn't been invented yet. I lost the ravine. I only knew I was still going up. There wasn't any doubt about that. After a while the rain slacked off and almost stopped. In an interval between crashes of thunder I beard voices.</p>
   <p>They were thin and far away. I tried to place them, and when I thought I had them pegged I started toward them. The steep pitch of the ground fell away into a dizzying downslope and I was almost running into a sort of long shallow trough, thickly wooded, its bottom hidden from any view at all except one directly overhead. And there were lights in it, or at least a light.</p>
   <p>I slowed down and went more carefully, hoping the storm would cover any noise I made.</p>
   <p>The voices went on, and now I could hear another sound, the scrinch and screek of metal rubbing on metal.</p>
   <p>I was on the clearing before I knew it. And it wasn't a clearing at all really, just one of those natural open places where the soil is too thin to support trees and runs to brush instead. It wasn't much more than ten feet across. Almost beside me were a couple of tents so cleverly hidden among the trees that you practically had to fall on them, as I did, to find them at all.</p>
   <p>From one of them came the sleepy sobbing of a child. In the small clearing Vadi and Arnek were watching a jointed metal mast build itself up out of a pit in the ground. The top of it was already out of sight in the cloud but it was obviously taller than the trees. The lamp was on the ground beside the pit.</p>
   <p>The faces of Vadi and her brother were both angry, both set and obstinate. Perhaps it was their mutual fury that made them seem less human, or more unhuman, than ever, the odd bone-structure of cheek and jaw accentuated, the whole head elongated, the silver-red hair fairly bristling, the copper-colored eyes glinting with that unpleasantly catlike brilliance in the light. They had been quarreling, and they still were, but not in English. Arnek had a look like a rattlesnake.</p>
   <p>Vadi, I thought, was frightened. She kept glancing at the tents, and in a minute the big man, Marlin, came out of one of them. He was pressing a small bandage on the side of his head, over his ear. He looked tired and wet and foul-tempered, as though he had not had an easy time getting back to base.</p>
   <p>He started right in on Vadi, cursing her because of what she had done.</p>
   <p>Arnek said in English, "I didn't ask her to come here, and I'm sending her home tonight."</p>
   <p>"That's great," Marlin said. "That's a big help. We'll have to move our base anyway now."</p>
   <p>"Maybe not," said Arnek defiantly. He watched the slim mast stretching up and up with a soft screeking of its joints.</p>
   <p>"You're a fool," said Marlin, in a tone of cold and bitter contempt "You started this mess, Arnek. You had to play around with that girl and make a kid to give the show away. Then you pull that half-cocked trick with those guys in the station wagon and you can't even do that right. You kill the one but not the other. And then she louses up the only chance we got left. You know how much money we're going to lose? You know how long it'll take us to find a location half as good as this? You know what I ought to do?"</p>
   <p>Arnek's voice was sharp, but a shade uncertain. "Oh, stop bitching and get onto those scanners. All we need is another hour and then they can whistle. And there are plenty of mountains."</p>
   <p>"Are there," said Marlin, and looked again at Vadi. "And how long do you think she'll keep her mouth shut at your end?"</p>
   <p>He turned and walked back into the tent. Arnek looked uncertainly at Vadi and then fixed his attention on the mast again. Vadi's face was the color of chalk. She started once toward the tent and Arnek caught her roughly and spoke to her in whatever language they used, and she stopped.</p>
   <p>I slid around the back of the tents to the one Marlin was in. There was a humming and whining inside. I got down on my hands and knees and crawled carefully over the wet grass between the tents, toward the front. The mast apparently made its last joint because it stopped and Arnek said something to Vadi and they bent over what seemed to be a sunken control box in the ground. I took my chance and whipped in through the tent flap.</p>
   <p>I didn't have long to look around. The space inside was crammed with what seemed to be electronic equipment. Marlin was sitting hunched up on a stool in front of a big panel with a dozen or so little screens on it like miniature television monitors. The screens, I just had time to see, showed an assortment of views of Buckhorn and the surrounding areas, and Marlin was apparently, by remote control, rotating one by one the distant receivers that sent the images to the screens. They must have been remarkably tight-beamed, because they were not much disturbed by static. I knew now how the eye of God had watched Doc and me on Tunkhannock Ridge.</p>
   <p>I didn't know yet how the lightning-bolts were hurled, but I was pretty sure Ed Betts would get one if his car showed up on a scanner screen, and who would be the wiser? Poor Ed hit by lightning just like old Doc, and weren't the storms something fierce this summer?</p>
   <p>Marlin turned around and saw it wasn't Arnek. He moved faster than I would have thought possible. He scooped up the light stool he was sitting on and threw it at me, leaping sideways himself in a continuation of the same movement. In the second in which I was getting my head out of the way of the stool he pulled a gun. He had had a spare, just as he must have had a car stashed somewhere in or near the town.</p>
   <p>He did not quite have time to fire. I shot him twice through the body. He dropped but I didn't know if he was dead. I kicked the gun out of his hand and jumped to stand flat against the canvas wall beside the front flap, not pressing against it. The canvas was light-proof, and the small lamps over the control panels did not throw shadows.</p>
   <p>Arnek did not come in.</p>
   <p>After a second or two I got nervous. I could hear him shouting "Marlin! Marlin!" I ran into the narrow space behind the banks of equipment, being extremely careful how I touched anything. I did not see any power leads. It dawned on me that all this stuff had come up out of a pit in the ground like the mast and that the generator must be down there below. The floor wasn't canvas at all, but some dark gray material to which the equipment was bolted.</p>
   <p>I got my knife out and started to slit the canvas at the back. And suddenly the inside of the tent was full of green fire. It sparked off every metal thing and jarred the gun out of my hand. It nearly knocked me out again. But I was shielded by the equipment from the full force of the shock. It flicked off again almost at once. I got the canvas cut and squirmed through it and then I put three or four shots at random into the back of the equipment just for luck.</p>
   <p>Then I raced around the front and caught Arnek just as he was deciding not to enter the tent after all.</p>
   <p>He had a weapon in his hand like the one Vadi had used on me. I said, "Drop it," and he hesitated, looking evil and upset. "Drop it!" I told him again, and he dropped it. "Now stand away," I said. "Walk out toward your sister, real slow, one step at a time."</p>
   <p>He walked, and I picked up the weapon.</p>
   <p>"Good," I said, "Now we can all relax." And I called Sally Tate, telling her it was safe to come out now.</p>
   <p>All this time since I was where I could see her Vadi had stood with one hand over her mouth, looking up into the mist.</p>
   <p>Sally Tate came out of the other tent. She was carrying the boy, and both their faces were pale and puffy-eyed and streaked with tears.</p>
   <p>"It's all right now," I said. "You can go—" I was going to say "home," and then there was a sound in the sky that was not wind or thunder, that was hardly a sound at all, but more of a great sigh. The air pressed down on me and the grass was flattened as by a down-driven wind and all the branches of the trees bowed. The mist rolled, boiled, was rent, torn apart, scattered.</p>
   <p>Something had come to rest against the top of the mast.</p>
   <p>Arnek turned and ran to Vadi and I did not stop him. I moved closer to Sally Tate, standing with her mouth open and her eyes big and staring.</p>
   <p>The mast began to contract downward, bringing the thing with it.</p>
   <p>I suppose I knew then what the thing was. I just didn't want to admit it. It was cylindrical and slender, about fifty feet long, with neither wings nor jets. I watched it come slowly and gracefully down, attached by its needle-sharp nose to the magnetic grapple on top of the mast. The mast acted as automatic guide and stabilizer, dropping the ship into a slot between the trees as neatly as you would drop a slice of bread into the slot of a toaster.</p>
   <p>And all the time the bitter breath of fear was blowing on me and little things were falling into place in my mind and I realized that I had known the answer for some time and had simply refused to see it.</p>
   <p>A port opened in the side of the ship. And as though that was the final symbolic trigger I needed, I got the full impact of what I was seeing. Suddenly the friendly protecting sky seemed to have been torn open above me as the veiling cloud was torn, and through the rent the whole Outside poured in upon me, the black freezing spaces of the galaxy, the blaze and strangeness of a billion billion suns. I shrank beneath that vastness. I was nothing, nobody, an infinitesimal fleck in a cosmos too huge to be borne. The stars had come too close. I wanted to get down and howl and grovel like a dog.</p>
   <p>No wonder Arnek and Vadi and the boy were queer. They were not mutants—they were not even that Earthly. They came from another world.</p>
   <p>A little ladder had extended itself downward from the port. A man came briskly to the ground and spoke to Arnek. He resembled Arnek except that he was dressed in a single close-fitting garment of some dark stuff. Arnek pointed to me, speaking rapidly. The man turned and looked at me, his body expressing alarm. I felt childish and silly standing there with my little gun. Lone man of Earth at an incredible Thermopylae, saying, "You shall not land."</p>
   <p>All the time Arnek and the stranger had been talking there had been other activities around the ship. A hatch in the stern had opened and now from both hatches people began to come out helter-skelter as though haste was the chief necessity. There were men and women both. They all looked human. Slightly odd, a little queer perhaps, but human. They were different types, different colors, sizes, and builds, but they all fitted in somewhere pretty close to Earthly types. They all looked a little excited, a little scared, considerably bewildered by the place in which they found themselves. Some of the women were crying. There were maybe twenty people in all.</p>
   <p>I understood then exactly what Arnek and Marlin had been up to and it seemed so grotesquely familiar and prosaic that I began to laugh.</p>
   <p>"Wetbacks," I said aloud. "That's what you're doing, smuggling aliens."</p>
   <p>Aliens. Yes indeed.</p>
   <p>It did not seem so funny when I thought about it.</p>
   <p>The stranger turned around and shouted an order. The men and women stopped, some of them still on the ladders. More voices shouted. Then those on the ladders were shoved aside and eight men in uniform jumped out, with weapons in their hands.</p>
   <p>Sally Tate let go one wild wavering shriek. The child fell out of her arms. He sat on the wet ground with the wind knocked out of him so he couldn't cry, blinking in shocked dismay. Sally tottered. Her big strong healthy body was sunken and collapsed, every muscle slack. She turned and made a staggering lunge for the tent and fell partly in through the doorway, crawled the rest of the way like a hurt dog going under a porch, and lay there with the flap pulled over her head.</p>
   <p>I didn't blame her. I don't even know what obscure force kept me from joining her.</p>
   <p>Of the eight men, five were not human. Two of them not even remotely.</p>
   <p>I can't describe them. I can't remember what they looked like, not clearly.</p>
   <p>Let's be honest. I don't want to remember.</p>
   <p>I suppose if you were used to things like that all your life it would be different. You wouldn't think anything about it.</p>
   <p>I was not used to things like that. I knew that I never would be, not if we ourselves achieved space-flight tomorrow. I'm too old, too set in the familiar pattern of existence that has never been broken for man since the beginning. Perhaps others are more resilient. They're welcome to it.</p>
   <p>I picked up the boy and ran.</p>
   <p>It came on again to rain. I ran down Buckhorn Mountain, carrying the boy in my arms. And the green lightning came after us, hunting us along the precipitous slope.</p>
   <p>The boy had got his breath back. He asked me why we had to die. I said never mind, and kept on running.</p>
   <p>I fell with him and rolled to the bottom of a deep gully. We were shaken. We lay in the dripping brush looking up at the lightning lancing across the night above us. After a while it stopped. I picked him up again and crept silently along the gully and onto the slope below.</p>
   <p>And nearly got shot by Ed Betts and a scratch posse, picking their cautious way up the mountainside.</p>
   <p>One of the men took the child out of my arms. I hung onto Ed and said inanely, "They're landing a load of wetbacks."</p>
   <p>"Up there?"</p>
   <p>"They've got a ship," I told him. "They're aliens, Ed. Real aliens."</p>
   <p>I began to laugh again. I didn't want to. It just seemed such a hellishly clever play on words that I couldn't help it.</p>
   <p>Fire bloomed suddenly in the night above us. A second later the noise of the explosion reached us.</p>
   <p>I stopped laughing. "They must be destroying their installations. Pulling out. Marlin said they'd have to. Christ. And Sally is still up there."</p>
   <p>I ran back up the mountain, clambering bearlike through the trees. The others followed.</p>
   <p>There was one more explosion. Then I came back to the edge of the clearing. Ed was close behind me. I don't think any of the others were really close enough to see. There was a lot of smoke. The tents were gone. Smoking trees were slowly toppling in around the edges of a big raw crater in the ground. There was no trace of the instruments that had been in the tents.</p>
   <p>The ship was still there. The crew, human and unhuman, were shoving the last of the passengers back into the ship. There was an altercation going on beside the forward port.</p>
   <p>Vadi had her arm around Sally Tate. She was obviously trying to get her aboard. I thought I understood then why Sally and the boy were still alive. Probably Vadi had been insisting that her brother send them along where they wouldn't be any danger to him, and he hadn't quite had the nerve to cross her. He was looking uncertain now, and it was the officer who was making the refusal. Sally herself seemed to be in a stupor.</p>
   <p>Vadi thrust past the officer and led Sally toward the ladder. And Sally went, willingly. I like to remember that, now, when she's gone.</p>
   <p>I think—I hope—that Sally's all right out there. She was younger and simpler than I, she could adapt. I think she loved Bill Jones—Arnek—enough to leave her child, leave her family, leave her world, and still be happy near him.</p>
   <p>Ed and I started to run across the clearing. Ed had not said a word. But his face was something to look at.</p>
   <p>They saw us coming but they didn't bother to shoot at us. They seemed in a tremendous hurry. Vadi screamed something, and I was sure it was in English and a warning to me, but I couldn't understand it. Then she was gone inside the ship and so were Arnek and Sally and the officer and crewmen, and the ladders went up and the ports shut.</p>
   <p>The mooring mast began to rise and so did the ship, and the trees were bent with the force of its rising.</p>
   <p>I knew then what the warning was.</p>
   <p>I grabbed Ed bodily and hauled him back. The ship didn't have to be very high. Only above the trees. I hauled him as far as blind instinct told me I could go and then I yelled, "Get down! Get down!" to everybody within earshot and made frantic motions. It all took possibly thirty seconds. Ed understood and we flopped and hugged the ground.</p>
   <p>The mast blew.</p>
   <p>Dirt, rocks, pieces of tree rained down around us. The shock wave pounded our ears. A few moments later, derisive and powerful, a long thin whistling scream tore upward across the sky, and faded, and was gone.</p>
   <p>We got up after a while and collected the muddy and startled posse and went to look at what was left of the clearing. There was nothing. Sally Tate was gone as though she had never existed. There was no shred of anything left to prove that what Ed and I had seen was real.</p>
   <p>We made up a story, about a big helicopter and an alien racket. It wasn't too good a story, but it was better than the truth. Afterward, when we were calmer, Ed and I tried to figure it out for ourselves. How it was done, I mean, and why.</p>
   <p>The "how" was easy enough, given the necessary technology. Pick a remote but not too inconveniently isolated spot, like the top of Buckhorn Mountain. Set up your secret installation—a simple one, so compact and carefully hidden that hunters could walk right over it and never guess it was there when it was not in use. On nights when conditions are right—that is to say, when the possibility of being observed is nearest to zero—run your cargo in and land it. We figured that the ship we saw wasn't big enough to transport that many people very far. We figured it was a landing-craft, ferrying the passengers down from a much bigger mothership way beyond the sky.</p>
   <p>A star-ship. It sounded ridiculous when you said it. But we had seen the members of the crew. It is generally acknowledged by nearly everybody now that there is no intelligent life of any terrestrial sort on the other planets of our own system. So they had to come from farther out.</p>
   <p>Why? That was a tougher one to solve. We could only guess at it.</p>
   <p>"There must be a hell of a big civilization out there," said Ed. "to build the ships and travel in them. They obviously know we're here."</p>
   <p>Uneasy thought.</p>
   <p>"Why haven't they spoken to us?" he wondered. "Let us in on it too."</p>
   <p>"I suppose," I said, "they're waiting for us to develop space-flight on our own. Maybe it's a kind of test you have to pass to get in on their civilization. Or maybe they figure we're so backward they don't want to have anything to do with us, all our wars and all. Or both. Pick your own reason."</p>
   <p>"Okay," said Ed. "But why dump their people on us like that? And how come Marlin, one of our own people, was in on it?"</p>
   <p>"There are Earthmen who'll do anything for money," I said. "Like Marlin. It'd not be too hard to contact men like him, use them as local agents."</p>
   <p>"As for why they dump their people on us," I went on, "it probably isn't legal, where they came from. Remember what Marlin said about Vadi? How long will she keep her mouth shut at your end? My guess is her brother was a failure at home and got into a dirty racket, and she was trying to get him out of it. There must be other worlds like Earth, too, or the racket wouldn't be financially sound. Not enough volume."</p>
   <p>"But the wetbacks," Ed said. "Were they failures, too? People who couldn't compete in the kind of a society they must have? And how the hell many do you suppose they've run in on us already?"</p>
   <p>I've wondered about that myself. How many aliens have Marlin, and probably others like him, taken off the star-boats and dressed and instructed and furnished with false papers, in return doubtless for all the valuables the poor devils had? How many of the people you see around you every day, the anonymous people that just look a little odd somehow, the people about whom you think briefly that they don't even look human—the queer ones you notice and then forget—how many of them aren't human at all in the sense that we understand that word?</p>
   <p>Like the boy.</p>
   <p>Sally Tate's family obviously didn't want him back. So I had myself appointed his legal guardian, and we get on fine together. He's a bright kid. His father may have been a failure in his own world, but on ours the half-bred child has an I.Q. that would frighten you. He's also a good youngster. I think he takes after his aunt.</p>
   <p>I've thought of getting married since then, just to make a better home for the boy, and to fill up a void in my own life I'm beginning to feel. But I haven't quite done it yet. I keep thinking maybe Vadi will come back some day, walking with swift grace down the side of Buckhorn Mountain. I do not think it is likely, but I can't quite put it out of my mind. I remember the cold revulsion that there was between us, and then I wonder if that feeling would go on, or whether you couldn't get used to that idea of differentness in time.</p>
   <p>The trouble is, I guess, that Vadi kind of spoiled me for the general run of women.</p>
   <p>I wonder what her life is like in Hrylliannu, and where it is. Sometimes on the bitter frosty nights when the sky is diamond-clear and the Milky Way glitters like the mouth of hell across it, I look up at the stars and wonder which one is hers. And old Buckhorn sits black and silent in the north, and the deep wounds on his shoulder are healing into grassy scars. He says nothing. Even the thunder now has a hollow sound. It is merely thunder.</p>
   <p>But, as Arnek said, there are plenty of mountains.</p>

    <p>Afterword</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Two WRITERS LIVING and working together, even if they do not collaborate, will inevitably influence each other's work, in one way or another. Writing is a uniquely personal and solitary endeavor; you do it the only way you know how. But when you're being constantly exposed to another way of doing it, a bit of that will rub off.</p>
   <p>Ed always knew the last line of a story before he wrote the first one, and every line he wrote aimed straight at that target. I used the opposite method—write an opening and let it grow. Outlining a plot seemed to kill it for me. Ed says that this method seemed to work fine for me, and so it did—when everything went well and the story wrote itself. When it did not, I found myself in a box canyon with no way up the walls, and another beautiful idea went into the files to gather dust.</p>
   <p>I began to realize that this method was not in any sense an artistic virtue; all it meant was that I didn't know how to construct a story. A lot of this was sheer impatience. I was in such a hurry to get to the wonderful adventures thronging in my mind that I couldn't be bothered with the bones of the thing. Like trying to take a trip with no map. After we were married, with both of us working like demons, I began to understand how Ed put a story together, and found myself doing the same thing. So if he learned a little bit about style from me, I learned a whole lot about structure from him.</p>
   <p>When I think about it, it's an odd thing; I never had any trouble at all constructing or plotting mystery stories. But that's more like working out an equation; given a certain event, other events will inevitably follow, and variables are limited by the space-time framework in which these events occur. In science fiction, the space-time framework has to be invented and the variables are what you make them. Which is of course why it's more fun to write sicence fiction, though the discipline of the murder mystery has its own special joys.</p>
   <p>Ed's mention of our "Benedict-Arnold-slept-here" adventures in rehabilitating our ancient wreck in the woods brings back many memories. Like the day on which the house became officially "ours." We were looking around it with fond and foolish pride, and Ed said, "That old paper on the ceiling will have to come off." He reached up to tear away a strip, and the whole ceiling fell on his head. I think my own low point was reached one miserable November day, with a mean wind blowing and a nasty little spit of snow, when I was trying to gather up some of the more unsightly debris left by the carpenters, who had simply pitched everything out the windows. There had been a thaw and then a freeze, and every rotten little stick and board-end was permanently imbedded in the icy mud. I remember wishing the entire assembly were in a warmer place!</p>
   <p>That scythe, now . . . I have a great admiration for those old-timers who could scythe a lawn as smooth as velvet. The stuff always looked as if the moths had been at it when I got through. Swinging a bushhook, on the other hand, I rather enjoyed. But don't talk to me about the evils of technology! When we were able to afford a powerful little garden tractor with a sickle-bar and a mower, life became a whole lot easier and the efficiency of the work done took a quantum jump.</p>
   <p>Nowadays, when people admire our house, our old orchard—we set out the tiny whips ourselves—and our several acres of smooth meadow, we always feel like telling them that they should have seen it when . . . when two families of skunks had to be evicted from the house before we could move in ourselves; when our carpenter quit for the day after a five-foot blacksnake who was living in the rafters bespoke him in a friendly fashion, tapping the back of his neck; when Hamilton and Brackett might have been seen almost any day doing battle with burdocks the size of oaks (we felt we were surrounded by Triffids) or ripping four by eight sheets of three-quarter-inch plywood the long way with a handsaw, and hammering far into the night. It only took us twenty-six years to get where we are!</p>
   <p>Actually, we owe the basic reconstruction of the house to two wonderful old men, one well up in his seventies, the other past eighty, who still understood the quirks of braced-frame houses and how to deal with them. They're worth a book in themselves.</p>
   <p>Regarding that Sako .222—Old Shatterhand wasn't all that much hell on woodchucks himself. Watching a litter of them romping like kittens on a sunny bank, all I heard from him was, "Aw-w . . . aren't they cute!"</p>
   <p>The one thing I've missed here in this green and fertile Midwest, which has many things we lack in California—spring blossoms, autumn leaves, and water, to name a few—is the sea. It was the dominant factor in my environment for so many years when I was growing up. And the beach where we lived was a wonderful place to grow up in. Not so now; the sand is about to sink under the weight of wall-to-wall apartment houses, and I never go there any more. But in those days there</p>
   <p>was a handful of little houses, an overarching sky, wind and sun and seagulls, and I loved it. There were winter gales that never seem to blow any more, and beautiful fogs so thick you could bite them and taste the salt. It was a place where I could be alone. I used to walk out to the end of a long jetty and sit on the stringer with my feet in the ocean, feeling it breathe, looking out to where the Pacific ran over the edge of the world and dreaming great dreams . . . but most of all I was learning what it felt like to be me. I have never understood people who cry that they don't know who they are. Maybe they just never sat down with themselves long enough to find out.</p>
   <p>My long in-and-out affair with Hollywood is perhaps rather an odd one. I don't know. When the job on The Big Sleep fell into my lap, out of the blue, and I was signed to a seven-year contract, everybody told me I had it made. I guess because I'm half Scots and inclined to ca' canny, I kept looking at the option clauses as much as I looked at the salary hikes that would have made me a junior-grade Croesus at the end of seven years. After two-and-a-half years the independent company which had signed me was dissolved for tax purposes, and I was dissolved with it, still somewhat short of my first million. My next job was on the B-lot at Columbia, where I did two scripts. The first one was a success, the second they washed out, and again, me with it. I don't think it was a bad script. But it was an offbeat story, and off-beat stories they did not want. So I had to go back to work, as it were. I hoped for another film job, but when it reached the point where the Guild was pleading with its members to write something, anything, even greeting-card verse, because there were no jobs to be had, I simply forgot about it. Since 1957 I've worked quite a lot in films and television, but I've never forgotten that early lesson: don't count on it. The bad thing about film or TV work is that you have to wait for someone to ask you to do it, whereas you can sit down and write a novel when and as you wish, and if you have a reasonable degree of competence you can be fairly sure of selling it somewhere. For that reason I have never felt like giving up my freedom of choice and relying entirely on Hollywood. Fairy gold is lovely when it comes, but if it doesn't, I've got my workroom here in Kinsman, and no mortgages.</p>
   <p>Besides, I like writing science fiction.</p>
   <p>Aside from the pleasure of congenial work and the making of a living, science fiction has given me much that is beyond price: lifelong friends, a worldwide family, and a marriage that has lasted almost thirty years to date.</p>
   <p>Even fairy gold won't buy all that!</p>

    <p>Addendum</p>
    <p>About the maps of Mars.</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>A couple of years ago, I began to correspond with a lady in Minneapolis who had liked my stories about Mars and who refused to be satisfied with my explanations about why editors do not want any more of them. (The planet, they believe, has become too harsh a reality for my brand of legend.)</p>
   <p>The lady's name was Margaret Howes, and later on I had the pleasure of meeting her at the Minneapolis convention. She told me that making maps of imaginary worlds was one of her favorite hobbies, and would I mind if she did some maps of Mars, based on my stories?</p>
   <p>Far from minding, I was delighted. And in due course, the maps arrived, a pure labor of love, together with keys and several closely-reasoned pages concerning the reasons for placement of the cities, canals, etc. She knows my stories, and the geography (or, as she says, Areography) implied therein, much better than I do.</p>
   <p>I thought the maps were beautiful. So did my editors, who decided to include them in this collection. And here you may find Jekkara and the Low Canals (I think the first mention of these was in "The Veil of Astellar"), and Valkis, and Barrakesh where John Ross met the man from Shandakor, and Shandakor itself, and that other lost city of Sinharat, beautiful derelicts in those haunted seas of drifting sand, of which Viking Lander is presently taking such incredible photographs.</p>
   <p>The cities and canals, of course, are fantasy. But the maps themselves . . . not so. Listen to the Cartographer.</p>
   <p>"No doubt you have the new probe map of Mars, and you will note that I took as much advantage of real natural features as I could. Syrtis Major and Sabaeus Sinus are obvious, of course, as the Eastern Drylands (I imagine this to have been a very deep section of ocean). Edom and Crater 2, in Syrtis, make good oasis spots, as does Solis Lacus for an oasis on the ocean bottom. Aurorae Sinus and Margaritifer Sinus have to be mostly desert, because all the stories speak of crossing only desert to get to Valkis or Jekkara. Shandakor is up there in Boreo Syrtis; Mare Acidalium becomes the hills of Outer Kesh; Oxia Palus is perfect for the location of the Wells of Karthedon; and no doubt you'll recognize the Nix Olympica area, not far from Kahora.</p>
   <p>"The other hemisphere doesn't give so much in the way of definite features to make use of, except that I do have Narrissan at the top of Nodus Laocontis; but I do hope that from a distance you will get some approximation of what the astronomers used to see through the telescope."</p>
   <p>She adds, "What made the Mars maps exceptionally fun to do was the challenge of trying to fit the stories into the actual geography (Or Areography, rather) of the real Mars. Also, I'm still hoping to see more stories of Low-Canal Mars."</p>
   <p>Where else but in the wonderful world of science-fiction would you meet wonderful people like Margaret Howes?</p>

    <p>MARS</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>By The</p>
   <p>Survey Commission Office, Kahora, Mars</p>
   <p>CENTRAL TERRAN ADMINISTRATION</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Note: major canals and gross topography are accurately reproduced from high-level aerial surveys. Details of surface areography are still largely unknown. because of difficult conditions and local hostility to both ground expeditions and/or low-level surveys. Many sites are reported but not confirmed. as will be seen in the key.</p>
   <p>Earthmen are warned to obtain permission from the Survey Office and to secure warranted guides through the Office, before travelling beyond the immediate vicinity of Kahora. The Administration assumes no responsibility for persons engaging in unauthorized travel.</p>
   <p>The sea-level indicated on these maps, including that defined by the dashed and dotted line, indicates the extent of the ancient Martian ocean basins, excluding the continental shelves. It appears that the waters retreated rather gradually down the shelves, which remained fertile, and that it was at this time that Jekkara and other sea-port cities were built, at the very edge of the abyssal basins. Scholars believe that the sea levels then remained fairly stable for some period ranging anywhere from several centuries to several millenia; there is much dispute on this point.</p>
   <p>However, there is general agreement that when the last dry-up began, it progressed continuously and rather rapidly to its final end. Again, there is much dispute as to how long this process took. Efforts have been made to work out a chronology by studying the degree of erosion that has taken place on even the largest, main canals, once laid out in perfect arcs or straight lines, and now much eroded and irregular (as will be seen from the map) or even wholly overwhelmed by sand. So far these studies have produced no definite conclusions.</p>
