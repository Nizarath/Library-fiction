   <p>“THE BIG SLEEP”</p>
   <p>Screenplay by</p>
   <p>William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett, Jules Furthman</p>
  </title>
  <section>
   <p>From the novel by Raymond Chandler</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>1944 </p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>FADE IN: 1. EXT. STERNWOOD PLACE - ESTABLISHING SCENE</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>It is a millionaire’s house, big, sprawling, California style, with clipped lawns and gardens, on a hill above the now abandoned oil field which was the family’s wealth. A small coupe drives up to the door and stops, and Philip Marlowe gets out. We just have time to establish him as he approaches the door — a husky, self-confident man, welldressed but not flashy.</p>
   <p>2. INSERT: A BRASS DOORPLATE KNOCKER WITH A BELL BENEATH lettered STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>3. EXT. FRONT DOOR - CLOSE SHOT - MARLOWE as NORRIS opens the door. Norris is thin, silver-haired with a gentle intelligent face.</p>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <p>(holding the door) Good morning, sir.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I’m Philip Marlowe. General Sternwood sent for me.</p>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(opens door,</p>
   <p>steps aside)</p>
   <p>Yes, Mr. Marlowe. Will you come in?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE (entering)</p>
   <p>Thanks.</p>
   <p>4. INT. FORMAL MALL - SAME OPULENT BIG-SCALE STYLE - MARLOWE as Norris shuts the door, takes Marlowe’s hat.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <p>Will you sit here? I’ll tell the General you have come.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE Okay.</p>
   <p>Norris exits. Marlowe looks about, interested and curious, sees something, moves toward it.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>5. CLOSE SHOT - MARLOWE</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>as he stands before a portrait, examining it with curious interest. It is a portrait of General Sternwood, in regimentals, beneath crossed battle-torn cavalry pennons and a sabre. He is still staring at the portrait when at a SOUND OFF, he turns and sees CARMEN STERNWOOD approaching. She is about 20, in slacks, something sullen and hot about her. She stops about 10 feet from him and stares at him, biting the thumb of her left hand.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Good morning.</p>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>(after a moment)</p>
   <p>You’re not very tall are you? MARLOWE I tried to be.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>Not bad looking, though — you probably know it.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Thanks.</p>
   <p>He goes to a chair and sits down. When he looks up, he sees Carmen approaching, still staring at him. CARMEN (approaching) What’s your name? MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Reilly — Doghouse Reilly.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>(beside the chair now)</p>
   <p>That’s a funny name. Are you a prize fighter?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE No. I’m a shamus. CARMEN A what?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE A private detective. CARMEN You’re cute.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>As she speaks, she sits suddenly on the arm of his chair. As she does so, Marlowe rises, shifts the chair in doing so, so that to her surprise, Carmen finds herself sitting in the chair itself. She stares up, surprised and then angrily, is about to speak again when they both see Norris. He has just entered noiselessly, stands beside the chair. On Norris’ face there is now a curious expression of grief, sadness. Carmen glances up at him, rises quickly as if he had reprimanded her with words, and exits. Marlowe looks after her, thoughtful, a little grim.</p>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <p>The General will see you now. MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(looking after Carmen) Who was that?</p>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <p>Miss Carmen Sternwood, sir.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>You ought to wean her. She looks old enough.</p>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <p>Yes, sir. This way, if you please.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>They exit through French doors. 6. EXT. REAR LAWN - SAME WEALTHY SCALE</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Garage at one side, beyond it a tremendous greenhouse. Norris is leading Marlowe along the path toward the green house. A chauffeur is washing a car before the garage. We establish him in passing — a handsome, boyish-looking man, OWEN TAYLOR.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe follows Norris on to the greenhouse, looking at the tremendous size of it as Norris opens the door and stands aside for Marlowe to enter.</p>
   <p>7. INT. GREENHOUSE CHOKED WITH ORCHID PLANTS</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe, following Norris between the crowding tendrils and branches. The place is oven-hot, damp with sweat, green with gloom. Marlowe is already reacting to it, is already mopping his face with his handkerchief.</p>
   <p>(mopping neck,</p>
   <p>following Norris)</p>
   <p>Couldn’t we have gone around this? NORRIS</p>
   <p>(over shoulder;</p>
   <p>walking on)</p>
   <p>The General sits in here, sir. 8. MED. CLOSE SHOT - GENERAL STERNWOOD</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>in a wheelchair in center of the greenhouse, in a cleared space about which the plants crowd and hover. The GENERAL is the man we saw in the portrait, though older, and obviously dying, so that only his fierce eyes seem to have any life. Even in the terrific heat his body is wrapped in a traveling rug and a heavy bathrobe, his gnarled hands lying like dead gnarled twigs on the rug, his fierce eyes following as Norris leads Marlowe in.</p>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <p>(stopping)</p>
   <p>This is Mr. Marlowe, General.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The General does not speak, only the fierce eyes stare at Marlowe as Norris pushes a wicker chair up behind Marlowe’s legs.</p>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>Brandy, Norris.</p>
   <p>(to Marlowe)</p>
   <p>How do you like your brandy, sir? MARLOWE (sitting down) Just with brandy. Norris takes Marlowe’s hat, exits.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>I used to like mine with champagne. The champagne cold as Valley Forge and about three ponies of brandy under it. You may take your coat off, sir.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Thanks.</p>
   <p>He rises, removes his coat, takes out his handkerchief, hangs his coat on chair.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>(watching him)</p>
   <p>It’s too hot in here for any man who still has blood in his veins.</p>
   <p>Marlowe sits again, mops his face and neck.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>(still watching him) You may smoke too. I can still enjoy the smell of it, anyway.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Thanks.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He produces a cigarette, lights it, blows smoke, Sternwood’s nostrils moving as he sniffs the smoke. Norris enters, pushing a teawagon bearing decanter, siphon, initialed ice-bucket.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>That man is already dead who must indulge his own vices by proxy.</p>
   <p>Norris wheels the wagon up, starts to prepare a drink.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>(watching pettishly) Come, man. Pour a decent one.</p>
   <p>NORRIS (adding brandy) Yes, General.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(watching)</p>
   <p>But not too decent, Norris. I don’t want to exchange places with it.</p>
   <p>Norris adds soda, hands glass to Marlowe. MARLOWE (taking glass) Thanks.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He sits back. Norris covers the ice-bucket with a napkin, exits. SOUND of DOOR CLOSING as Norris leaves the greenhouse. Marlowe raises the glass, sips. Sternwood watches him, licks his lips with longing pleasure and enjoyment. Marlowe lowers the glass.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>Tell me about yourself, Mr. Marlowe. I suppose I have the right to ask. There’s not much to tell. I’m thirty-eight years old, went to college once. I can still speak English when there’s any demand for it in my business. I worked for the District Attorney’s office once. It was Bernie Ohls, his chief</p>
   <p>investigator, who sent me word you wanted to see me. I’m not married.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>You didn’t like working for Mr. Wilde?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I was fired for insubordination I seem to rate pretty high on that.</p>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>I always did, myself. Sir -</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(he slides one</p>
   <p>hand under the</p>
   <p>rug on his knees)</p>
   <p>What do you know about my family, Mr. Marlowe?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(mopping)</p>
   <p>You’re a widower, a millionaire, two young daughters. One unmarried, the other married once but it didn’t didn’t take. Both now living with you and both -</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(he breaks off;</p>
   <p>the General’s</p>
   <p>fierce eyes</p>
   <p>watch him)</p>
   <p>STERNWOOD Go on.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Am I to swap you gossip for hospitality?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>(sternly)</p>
   <p>You are to swap me your confidence for my own.</p>
   <p>(shrugs)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>All right. Both pretty, and both pretty — wild. What did you want to see me about?</p>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>I’m being blackmailed again. MARLOWE (mopping)</p>
   <p>Again?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>(draws his hand</p>
   <p>out from under</p>
   <p>the rug, holding</p>
   <p>a brown envelope)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>About a year ago I paid a man named Joe Brody five thousand dollars to let my younger daughter alone.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Ah.</p>
   <p>STERNWOOD What does that mean?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>It means ‘ah.’ It never went through the D.A.‘s office, or I’d have known it. Who handled that for you?</p>
   <p>STERNWOOD Shawn Regan did.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(alternating between</p>
   <p>the drink, the</p>
   <p>cigarette and</p>
   <p>the now sodden</p>
   <p>handkerchief with</p>
   <p>which he mops his</p>
   <p>face and neck)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>There must be some reason why Regan’s not handling this one too. Am I to know it?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD Shawn has left me. I thought I hadn’t seen him around lately.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>Yes, he left about a month ago, without a word. That was what hurt. I had no claim on him, since I was only his employer. But I hoped we were more than that and that he would have said goodbye to me. You knew him too?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Yes. From the old days, when he was running rum from Mexico and I was on the other side, and now and then we swapped shots between drinks — or drinks between shots, if you like that better.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>My respects to you. Few men ever exchange more than one shot with Shawn Regan. He commanded a brigade in the Irish Republican Army, you know.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(mopping)</p>
   <p>No, I didn’t. But I knew he was a good man at whatever he did. Nobody was pleased better than me when I heard you had taken him on as your — whatever he was here.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>As my friend, my son almost. Many’s the hour he would sit here with me, sweating like a pig, drinking the brandy I could no longer drink, telling me stories of the Irish revolution — But enough of this.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(he holds out</p>
   <p>the envelope)</p>
   <p>Here. And help yourself to the brandy.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe takes the envelope, sits again, wipes his hands on his wet handkerchief, removes from the envelope a card and three clips of stiff paper.</p>
   <p>9. INSERT: CARD</p>
   <p>— in Marlowe’s hand Mr. Arthur Gwynne Geiger Rare Books and Deluxe Editions Marlowe’s hand turns the card over. On the back, in hand-printing.</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>In spite of the legal uncollectibility of the enclosed, which frankly are gambling debts, I assume you might wish them honored.</p>
   <p>Respectfully, A.G. Geiger. DISSOLVE TO: 10. INSERT: THREE PROMISSORY NOTES</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Filled out in ink, dated: September 3 September 8 September 11</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>On demand I promise to pay to Arthur Gwynne Geiger on order the sum of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) without interest. Value Received.</p>
   <p>Carmen Sternwood 11. STERNWOOD AND MARLOWE - (AS BEFORE) Sternwood watching from wheelchair as Marlowe mixes himself a drink at the wagon, then turns toward chair.</p>
   <p>STERNWOOD (watching Marlowe) Well?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(standing)</p>
   <p>Who’s Arthur Gwynne Geiger? STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>I haven’t the faintest idea. MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Have you asked your daughter?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>I don’t intend to. If I did she would suck her thumb and look coy.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Yeah. I met her in the hall. She did that at me. Then she tried to sit in my lap.</p>
   <p>Sternwood stares at him. After a moment Marlowe raises the glass, drinks, lowers it.</p>
   <p>STERNWOOD (harshly)</p>
   <p>Well?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(stares at him a moment) Am I being polite, or can I say what I want?</p>
   <p>STERNWOOD Say it.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Do the two girls run around together?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>I think not. They are alike only in their one corrupt blood. Vivian is spoiled, exacting, smart, ruthless. Carmen is still the child who likes to pull the wings off flies. I assume they have always had all the usual vices; whatever new ones of their own invention -</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(again he makes</p>
   <p>the repressed</p>
   <p>convulsive</p>
   <p>movement, glares</p>
   <p>at Marlowe)</p>
   <p>Well?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Pay him.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD Why?</p>
   <p>It’s cheaper. A little money against a lot of annoyance. The money you won’t miss, and if your heart hasn’t broken long before this time, whatever’s behind these -</p>
   <p>(indicates the notes</p>
   <p>on the chair)</p>
   <p>— can’t do it now.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>Not my heart. No Sternwood ever had one. But there is my pride, which I at least, and I believe my older daughter still, both have.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Sure. A man named A.G. Geiger’s just betting himself three thousand bucks on that pride. Who was this Joe Brody you paid the five thousand to?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>I don’t recall. Norris would know. My butler. I think he called himself a gambler.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(hopefully)</p>
   <p>This may be an authentic gambling debt, after all.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe looks at Sternwood for a moment. Then he half turns, sets the glass on the wagon and takes the napkin from around the ice bucket and mops himself with it. Sternwood watches him.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Do you think it is? STERNWOOD (after a second) No.</p>
   <p>Marlowe mops himself again with the napkin, puts it back on the wagon, takes up his glass, drinks.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I guess you want me to take this Geiger off your back: that right?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD Yes.</p>
   <p>Do you want to know anything, or do you just want to be rid of him?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>Didn’t you just tell me I no longer have any heart to be broken?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>It may cost you a little — besides my own twenty-five a day and expenses.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Sternwood says nothing, merely makes a faint, impatient movement of his head or shoulders. Marlowe drains the glass, sets it back on the wagon.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE When do I start?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>At once. And now if you will excuse me — But another brandy before you go?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE (takes up papers from chair, then his coat)</p>
   <p>No thanks.</p>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>(presses bell plugged</p>
   <p>into chair arm)</p>
   <p>Then good morning. And good luck.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He lies back in the chair, closes his eyes. Marlowe watches him a moment, then, his coat over his arm and still mopping his neck, he turns and exits.</p>
   <p>12. EXT. GREENHOUSE - MARLOWE</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>emerges, still carrying his coat, dripping wet, mopping with his sodden handkerchief, breathing the cool air, starts away. Before he reaches the house, Norris meets him, pauses two feet away, silver-haired, respectful, grave.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <p>Mrs. Rutledge, the older daughter would like to see you before you leave, sir. And about the money: the General has instructed me to give you a check for whatever you require.</p>
   <p>Instructed you how?</p>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(blinks, stares,</p>
   <p>then smiles)</p>
   <p>Ah, I see, sir. I forgot you are a detective. By the way he rang the bell.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE You write his checks.</p>
   <p>NORRIS I have that privilege.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(starts on)</p>
   <p>That ought to save you from a pauper’s grave. I won’t need any money now, thanks — How did Mrs. Rutledge know I was here?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <p>She saw you through the window. I was obliged to tell her who you were.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE I don’t like that.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <p>Are you attempting to tell me my duties, sir?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>No. Just having fun trying to guess what they are.</p>
   <p>NORRIS This way, sir.</p>
   <p>13. INT. VIVIAN’S SITTING ROOM</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The room is large, over-elaborate, feminine. VIVIAN reclines on a chaise-lounge, showing her legs to good advantage. She is beautiful, giving an impression of strong will and strong emotions, the dangerous unpredictable type.</p>
   <p>She sips a drink, insolently at ease, watching Marlowe as he enters. Marlowe is still rumpled and sweating. He adopts her be-damned-to-you attitude, looks her over, and sits down unbidden, wiping his face and neck with his handkerchief.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>So you’re a private detective. I didn’t know they existed except in books, or else they were little greedy men snooping around hotels. My, you’re a mess, aren’t you?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Yeah — I’m not the orchid-bearing type.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>This business of Dad’s — think you can handle it for him?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(sardonically)</p>
   <p>It doesn’t look too tough.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>Really. I would have thought a case like that took a little effort.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Not too much.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>Well! What will your first step be? MARLOWE The usual one.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>I didn’t know there was a usual one.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Oh, yes. It comes complete with diagrams on Page forty-seven of “How to be a Detective in Ten Easy Lessons”, correspondence school textbook.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>You must have read another one on how to be a comedian. I’m quite serious, Mr. Marlowe. My father is not well, and I want this case handled with the least possible worry to him.</p>
   <p>That’s the way I’m going to handle it.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>I see. No professional secrets.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe doesn’t answer. He’s still admiring her legs. Vivian sets her glass down, looking him over coolly, as though he were something in a bottle.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN How do you like Dad? MARLOWE I liked him.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>He liked Shawn. I suppose you know who Shawn is?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Yeah, I know.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>You don’t have to play poker with me. Dad wants to find him, doesn’t he?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Do you?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>Of course I do! It wasn’t right for him to go off like that. Broke Dad’s heart, although he won’t say much about it. Or did he?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE He mentioned it.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>I don’t see what there is to be cagey about. And I don’t like your manners.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I’m not crazy about yours. I didn’t ask to see you. And I don’t mind your ritzing me, or drinking your lunch out of a bottle. I don’t mind your showing me your legs. They’re very swell legs and it’s a pleasure to make their acquaintance. I don’t mind if you don’t like my manners.</p>

   <p>Beyond the lawns and hedges of the Sternwood estate the ground falls away to barren fields with several old wooden derricks, some of them still wearily pumping oil. The derricks are at a considerable distance from the house, but a man with binoculars could see any activity around them clearly enough. The sky is clouded; THUNDER SOUNDS distantly.</p>

   <p>The windows are blanked off with Chinese screens, fronted by large Oriental urns. Marlowe puts on a pair of hornrimmed sun glasses, adjusts his hat to a less rakish angle, and enters.</p>

   <p>AGNES, a hard-looking, expensive blonde in a tight black dress, rises from behind the desk as Marlowe approaches and moves to greet him. Her manner is professionally distant, her accent betrays her phony veneer.</p>

   <p>They look like books from here, anyway. Maybe I’d better talk to Mr. Geiger.</p>
   <p>AGNES</p>
   <p>He’s not in at the moment.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe glances up as a man enters the store; a middleaged, important-looking person who has an incongruously furtive and nervous manner. He looks quickly at Marlowe, then at Agnes, who gives him an almost imperceptible warning nod. Marlowe remains blandly unaware of the byplay, all his attention apparently on the cigarette he’s lighting.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The man walks quickly to the rear of the store. Agnes pushes a button on the desk. A door in the back wall opens on a buzzer lock. The man darts through it like a rabbit.</p>
   <p>AGNES</p>
   <p>(to Marlowe)</p>
   <p>I said Mr. Geiger is not in. MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I heard you. I’ll wait for him. AGNES</p>
   <p>He won’t be back until very late.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>At this point the furtive man comes out of the rear part of the store and leaves hurriedly, looking at neither Agnes nor Marlowe. His face is lined and haggard. Marlowe is interested.</p>

   <p>Agnes stares viciously at his back until he is out. Then she goes to the door at the rear, knocks and goes through. 21. MOVING SHOT - MARLOWE</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He walks across the boulevard, turns into a small bookstore, the second-hand variety, cluttered and dingy. Several nondescript people browse among the tables. At the rear a small, dark, shrewd-faced woman sits reading at a desk — apparently she is the proprietor. Marlowe approaches her, and she looks up blank-faced from her book.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>

   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>…or a Chevalier Audubon 1840…? The woman stops, closes the book. PROPRIETRESS</p>
   <p>Nobody would. There isn’t one. MARLOWE</p>

   <p>I’d rather get wet in here.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>A narrow street with a high bank on one side and a scattering of cabinlike houses built down the slope on the other side, so that their roofs are not much above street level. They are masked by hedges and shrubs. Sodden trees line the dark road.</p>
   <p>The headlights of a car appear. Geiger’s coupe drives up and stops in front of the garage of a small house almost completely hidden by a square box hedge. Geiger gets out, opens an umbrella, and vanishes behind the hedge. Almost immediately Marlowe’s car appears, continuing slowly past Geiger’s house. It turns, stops under a tree. The lights go out.</p>

   <p>A dark convertible stops in front of Geiger’s house. The lights go out. A small slim woman in a vagabond hat and raincoat gets out. She pauses, looking around — we see her face dimly. It is CARMEN STERNWOOD. She vanishes behind the hedge. The DOORBELL RINGS faintly, the door opens and closes.</p>

Suddenly a hard white flash of light shoots out of Geiger’s house like s flash of lightning. Close on its heels comes a woman’s thin half-pleasurable scream. Marlowe is out of the car and on his way.</p>
   <p>30. EXT. GEIGER’S HOUSE - NIGHT (RAIN)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe rounds the hedge on the run. There is a wooden footbridge bridging the gap between the bank and the front door. He covers this in two jumps and stops at the front door. The knocker is in the shape of a lion’s head, and ring in its mouth. Marlowe puts his hand on it, and as he does, three SHOTS SOUND from inside.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe freezes. From inside we HEAR a sighing groan and the thud of a falling body, then footsteps going away. Marlowe looks over the railing of the bridge, but there’s no way around to the back. He stands still, listening. Light shows from the house, behind draperies. From offscene at some distance, we HEAR someone running down steps.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>The SOUND of the two cars is still audible, fading into distance. Marlowe listens to it. When everything is quiet again he tries the front door, finds it locked. French windows flank the door just out of reach beyond the railing of the bridge. Marlowe swings out over the railing, kicks in the right-hand window, and pulls himself over the sill.</p>
   <p>34. INT. GEIGER’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>As Marlowe comes in through the window. The room is wide, low-beamed ceiling, brown plaster walls with strips of Chinese embroidery and Oriental prints on them. Low bookshelves, a desk, thick rug floor cushions, low divans</p>
   <p>— an exotic messy atmosphere.</p>
   <p>On a low dais at one end of the room is a carved teakwood chair, a massive thing in which Carmen Sternwood sits, rigidly erect, in the pose of an Egyptian goddess.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>She wears a man’s large silk dressing gown — it doesn’t pretend to fit her and gives the impression of having been thrown hurriedly around her by someone other than herself. Carmen’s eyes have a queer fixed stare. She pays no attention to Marlowe. She looks as if, in her mind, she is doing something very important and doing it well. She seems pleased about it, her lips curved to a smile. She laughs from time to time — softly, secretly.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Opposite her, Geiger lies on the floor in front of a thing like a totem pole. The eye of the totem is a camera lens; it focuses on the chair where Carmen sits. A blackened flash bulb is clipped to the totem beside it. Geiger is dressed in semi-oriental fashion. His embroidered coat is soaked with blood. He is obviously dead.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe takes all this in, sniffs the air. It is heavy with something unpleasant. He crosses to a small lacquer table bearing a flagon of dark liquid and two glasses. Marlowe sniffs the flagon, makes a grimace of disgust. Carmen’s clothes are wadded up on the divan. Marlowe picks up her coat and shoes and goes to her.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Hello. Remember me.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>She doesn’t seem to see him. The soft, secret laughter is his only answer. He goes closer, and deliberately slaps her face. This gets a reaction — he slaps her again, without emotion, but hard. Carmen comes to, slightly, giving him a sly, mad smile.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>You’re higher than a kite. Come on, let’s be nice. Let’s get dressed, Carmen.</p>
   <p>He puts her shoes on. CARMEN (giggling) You tickle.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Yeah, you tickle me, too.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe pulls her to her feet and puts her coat on, trying not to dislodge the dressing gown. She falls against him, very happy about it all, apparently about to pass out. Marlowe is not happy.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Let’s take a walk. CARMEN</p>
   <p>(thickly, half conscious) You’re cute.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Sure, sure. So’s your boyfriend. Want to look at him?</p>
   <p>He walks the staggering girl over to Geiger’s body. It is hard work — and Carmen is not impressed.</p>
   <p>CARMEN (as before) He’s cute.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Cute. Yeah. Let’s walk.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He walks her back and forth across the room a couple of times — LOW CAMERA FEATURING the dead man as their legs pass in front of him. Then she passes out in his arms, still convinced that everything is cute. He spreads her out on the divan, unconsciously wiping his hands on his coat as though he has touched something dirty.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Then he returns to the totem and Geiger’s body. He examines the concealed camera. The plateholder is gone. He rolls Geiger’s body over enough to see under it. No plateholder. He frowns thoughtfully at the girl… then goes into the rear of the house.</p>

   <p>Marlowe passes quickly through the bath and kitchen, pausing to try the locked kitchen door and to examine a window which had been jimmied open. The scars show plainly on the wood, the rain blowing in unheeded. Marlowe then goes to the bedroom, which is in keeping with the living room. He glances briefly through the closet, with a man’s clothes in it, then picks up a keyholder from the dressing table, where it has been placed along with other contents of Geiger’s pockets — money, handkerchief, <emphasis>etc.</emphasis></p>

He pockets the keys, turns off the lamps and the gas logs in the fireplace, makes a wadded bundle of Carmen’s clothes, jams her hat on her head and picks her up, holding her clothes awkwardly in one hand. On the way out he pushes down the light switch by the door, and kicks the door shut behind him.</p>

   <p>Norris appears in it, recognizes Marlowe, looks swiftly past him and recognizes the car also. Then he looks at Marlowe again — the same quiet, grave face with its expression of grief and sadness which the sight of the car brought into it. His voice though is quiet and calm.</p>

   <p>The body is gone. Marlowe crosses the room, wasting no time, determined. He passes through door to bedroom, snaps light on beyond it, after a moment the light beyond the door snaps off and Marlowe re-enters living room. He has not found the body. He stands for a moment, thinking, then he goes and kneels so that he can squint along the surface of the thick rug. He sees in the nap the marks where Geiger’s heels were dragged along it, across the room toward the front door. He rises at last, thoughtful, slowly takes out a cigarette and lights it, drops match into ashtray, stops, takes up the dead match and puts it into his pocket.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Then he takes out his handkerchief, goes and wipes off the bedroom doorknob, goes to the first lamp, turns it out and wipes it off, leaving room in darkness and himself a shadow which can be barely seen in the act of wiping off that button. Then he crosses the room.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe, in bed, wakes reluctantly as LOUD KNOCKING on the apartment door penetrates his slumber. He crawls out of bed, obviously the worse for a hangover, pulls on a dressing gown as he staggers sleepily toward the next room.</p>

   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(as the KNOCKING continues) All right, all right. Keep your pants on…</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>as Marlowe opens it to admit BERNIE OHLS, a dapper, slightly flashy man, whose clothes are expensive and always a little wrong. His face is dapper and deceiving since it is actually the face of a man who has been in close places in the course of his duty, has killed several lawbreakers, at times when he was outnumbered and they thought he was covered and helpless until too late. He is pleasant and affable to all, respects courage, loves no man.</p>

   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Well Bernie. Don’t you ever go to bed?</p>

   <p>Boy, what a beautiful hangover! Tut, tut — man your age, out on the town all night…</p>
   <p>MARLOWE I got it right here. OHLS (sitting)</p>
   <p>That’s even worse. MARLOWE</p>
   <p>All right — what is it? OHLS</p>
   <p>Does it have to be something?</p>

   <p>Look, Bernie, when somebody from the Homicide Squad comes over to help…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>OHLS</p>
   <p>You’re working for the Sternwoods, aren’t you?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE (warily)</p>
   <p>Yeah.</p>
   <p>OHLS</p>
   <p>Done anything for ‘em yet?</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>OHLS</p>
   <p>(laughing)</p>
   <p>Okay — They seem to be a family that things happen to. A big Buick belonging to one of them is washing around in the surf off Lido fish pier. Oh yea, I almost forgot. There’s a guy in it.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(flatly, after a pause) Regan?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>OHLS</p>
   <p>Who? Oh, you mean that Irish ex-legger old Sternwood hired to do his drinking for him. What would he be doing down there?</p>
   <p>He watches Marlowe’s face narrowly — it tells him nothing.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>What would anybody be doing down there?</p>

   <p>OHLS</p>

   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Thanks, Bernie. Yeah, be with you in ten minutes.</p>
   <p>He starts out, already pulling off his dressing gown. Ohls looks after him, frowning.</p>
   <p>DISSOLVE TO: 46. INT. CAR - OHLS AND MARLOWE - MORNING Ohls is driving. It is an official car, now and then Ohls sounds the siren.</p>

   <p>(he SOUNDS SIREN</p>
   <p>— the car is</p>

   <p>Who is it? Don’t they know yet?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>OHLS</p>
   <p>Now, now. Behave. What made Regan skip out? Or ain’t you interested in that either?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Why should I be?</p>

   <p>That wasn’t what old Sternwood wanted you for, then?</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>A faded stucco arch, the sea beyond it, the pier stretching away as Ohls’ car stops before the entrance and Ohls and Marlowe get out. Beside the arch are parked a police car and several police motorcycles. The long pier, railed with white two-by-fours, runs out over the water. There are several private cars parked along the road, a crowd of people is gathered at the far end of the pier as a motorcycle officer, stationed beneath the arch, is holding back another crowd as Ohls and Marlowe come up. Ohls shows the officer his badge.</p>

   <p>Ohls, followed by Marlowe, passes onto the pier. 48. SEAWARD END OF PIER</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>A shattered gap in the railing at the end of the pier shows where the car crashed through. Another crowd of people held back by other policemen, gather along the broken railing in b.g. Beyond them, moored to the end of the pier, lies a flat barge with wheelhouse and derrick. As Ohls and Marlowe approach, the police herd the crowd back and four men come up from the barge, carrying a</p>
   <p>sheet-covered stretcher and carry it on across the SHOT -the crowd gaping after it. As the bearers are about to pass, Ohls stops them.</p>
   <p>OHLS Wait a minute. The bearers stop. Ohls turns the sheet back, looks at the dead man’s face.</p>
   <p>(over his shoulder to Marlowe)</p>
   <p>Want a look?</p>
   <p>Marlowe looks at the face for a moment. Ohls drops the sheet back.</p>
   <p>OHLS (to bearers) All right. Beat it.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The bearers go on. Ohls and Marlowe approach the barge, the crowd gawking about them, after the stretcher, the policemen shoving among them.</p>
   <p>A POLICEMAN (to crowd)</p>
   <p>That’s all now. Go on. 49. DECK OF BARGE MOORED TO THE END OF THE PIER</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>On it sits the car which has been lifted from the water. It is the same black sedan which Marlowe saw the chauffeur washing yesterday in Sternwood’s garage — bent and stained with water. In front of the car are gathered Ohls, Marlowe, a uniformed deputy, two plainclothesmen and the Medical Examiner who has just finished repacking his small black bag.</p>
   <p>OHLS (to deputy) What’s the story?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>DEPUTY</p>
   <p>You can see most of it from here. Went through the rail yonder. Must have hit it pretty hard. The rain stopped down here about nine P.M. The broken ends of the rails are dry inside. That would put it about nine-thirty last night.</p>
   <p>OHLS Drunk, huh?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>PLAINCLOTHESMAN</p>
   <p>Then he must have been that guy you hear about that always drives better drunk. He plowed an awful straight furrow down that pier, right to the end of it. Then he hit the railing right square head-on — hard and clean</p>
   <p>— or he wouldn’t have gone through it. All right. Suicide then.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>DEPUTY</p>
   <p>The hand-throttle was set half-way down. Something had hit him a pretty hard lick across the left temple.</p>
   <p>OHLS</p>
   <p>(to Medical Examiner) All right, Doc. Let’s have it. MEDICAL EXAMINER His neck was broken.</p>
   <p>OHLS</p>
   <p>What made the bruise? Steering-wheel?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MEDICAL EXAMINER</p>
   <p>It was made by something covered. The wound had already bled under the skin while he was still alive.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE A blackjack?</p>
   <p>They all turn and glance at Marlowe.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>OHLS</p>
   <p>(after a moment)</p>
   <p>I’d forgotten about you. Let’s go back to town.</p>
   <p>50. EXT. PIER - MARLOWE AND OHLS They are walking back toward their car. A few people still hang around, staring at the barge.</p>
   <p>OHLS</p>
   <p>So you recognized him.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Yeah. Sternwood’s chauffeur. I saw him washing that same car yesterday.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>OHLS</p>
   <p>So that was what old Sternwood wanted with you.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Look, I don’t even know his name -I do. His name’s Owen Taylor. About a year or so back he run Sternwood’s daughter, the hotcha one, off to Yuma. The older sister run after them and brought the girl back and had Taylor thrown into the icebox. Then the next day she comes down and begs the kid off — said the kid meant to marry the sister, only the sister can’t see it. So they let the kid go, and darned if the Sternwoods don’t have him come back to work, same as if nothing had happened.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>And now somebody’ll have to go see them about this.</p>
   <p>OHLS</p>
   <p>Yep. That’s me, probably.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Leave the old man out of it, if you can. He’s got enough troubles already besides being sick.</p>
   <p>OHLS Regan, huh?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I don’t know anything about Regan. I told you that.</p>
   <p>OHLS</p>
   <p>Then what are you doing in this?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I’m not looking for Regan. I can tell you that much.</p>
   <p>OHLS</p>
   <p>(dryly)</p>
   <p>Yeah. I heard you the first time. DISSOLVE TO: 51. INT. GEIGER’S STORE</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe enters, wearing the dark glasses as before, and as before, Agnes rises from behind the desk. She is not happy to see Marlowe.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(cheerily)</p>
   <p>Hello — I’m back again. Mr. Geiger in?</p>
   <p>AGNES I’m afraid not. No. Marlowe glances around to make sure they’re alone, then removes the glasses and moves close to Agnes.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>It was just a stall about those first editions. I got something to sell. Something Geiger’s wanted for a long time.</p>

   <p>AGNES</p>
   <p>Oh — I see. Well — you might come back tomorrow. I think…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Drop the veil, sister. I’m in the business too.</p>
   <p>Agnes stares at him, scared stiff, not knowing how to get rid of him.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>

   <p>I haven’t got forever. Is he sick? I could go up to the house</p>

   <p>AGNES</p>
   <p>(frantically)</p>
   <p>No, that wouldn’t do any good -he’s out of town. Couldn’t you tomorrow? -</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe glances up sharply as Carol Lundgren, the dark handsome boy in the leather jacket, opens the door in the rear wall. Behind him, through the open door, we see the back room, littered with the papers and boxes of hurried packing, and a gaunt, hard-looking man with a certain animal attractiveness in the midst of it, cramming folios and stacks of large-sized envelopes into the packing boxes. Carol is obviously strained and under tension, looking as though he has not slept.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CAROL</p>
   <p>(desperately)</p>
   <p>Agnes, you’ve got to -He becomes aware of Marlowe, shuts up abruptly, and slams</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>the door. From the partition his voice rises, sharp but unintelligible, answered by a heavier, man’s voice — no words come through, but the implication is clearly that Carol shall shut up and get out. A door slams violently, then there is silence. Marlowe, ignoring this byplay, and the stricken look on Agnes’ face, puts on his glasses and touches his hat.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Tomorrow, then. Early. AGNES Yes, early.</p>
   <p>Before Marlowe has quite left the shop she darts back through the rear door.</p>

   <p>A small room, cheaply furnished, with a closed door in one wall. Vivian sits waiting for him, beautifully but simply dressed, quite at ease. She seems in a better humor this morning, smiling at the surprised Marlowe.</p>
   <p>Well, you DO exist, after all. I’d begun to think I dreamed you out of a bottle of bad gin.</p>

   <p>You can’t make much money at this trade, if you’re honest. If you have a front, you’re making money or expect to.</p>

   <p>She looks away from him, angry hut not able to say anything. Marlowe sits down behind the desk.</p>

   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>What did you want to see me about? Taylor?</p>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>(softly)</p>
   <p>Poor Owen. So you know about that.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>A D.A.‘s man took me down to Lido. Turned out he knew more about it than I did. He knew Owen Taylor wanted to marry your sister — once.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>(quietly)</p>
   <p>Perhaps it wouldn’t have been a bad idea. He was in love with her. We don’t find much of that in our circle…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(changing her tone)</p>
   <p>But I didn’t come to see you about Owen. Do you feel yet that you can tell me what my father wants you to do?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Not without his permission. VIVIAN Was it about Carmen? MARLOWE I can’t even say that.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Vivian watches him for a moment, then gives in. She takes a thick white envelope from her bag and tosses it on the desk.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>You’d better look at this anyway. Marlowe examines the envelope. A messenger brought it this morning.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Eight-thirty-five it says — for you or your father.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He opens the envelope, takes out a medium-sized photograph. We do not see the subject of the picture, but Marlowe’s reaction is significant. He whistles softly.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>So that’s what Carmen looks like! (to Vivian)</p>
   <p>How much do they want for this?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>Five thousand — for the negative and the rest of the prints. The deal has to be closed tonight, or they give the picture to some scandal sheet.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE The demand came how?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>A woman telephoned me, shortly after this thing was delivered.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>There’s nothing in the scandal sheet angle. Juries convict on that racket without leaving the box. What else is there?</p>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>Does there have to be something else? Marlowe nods — his face is uncompromising.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>(giving in again)</p>
   <p>The woman said there was a police jam connected with it, and I’d better lay it on the line fast or I’d be talking to my little sister through a wire screen.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE (deadpan, nodding) What kind of a jam? VIVIAN I don’t know.</p>
   <p>Where’s Carmen now?</p>

   <p>What was Owen doing with your car last night?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>Nobody knows. He took it without permission. Do you think…?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>He knew about this photo?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(shrugging)</p>
   <p>I don’t rule him out… Can you get five thousand in cash right away?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>I can borrow it — probably from Eddie Mars.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(sardonically)</p>
   <p>There’s a bond between us, you see. Shawn Regan ran away with Eddie’s blonde wife.</p>
   <p>(turning away -</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>leaving a pause)</p>
   <p>You may need the money in a hurry.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>How about telling the police?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>You know better than that. The police might turn up something they couldn’t sit on — and then where would the Sternwoods be?</p>
   <p>(after a pause)</p>
   <p>How was it left?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>The woman said she’d call me back with instructions at five.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Okay — call me here as soon as you’ve heard from her.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN Can you do anything?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I think so. But I can’t tell you how — or why.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>I like you. You believe in miracles.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(laughing)</p>
   <p>I believe in people believing they’re smarter than they are — if that’s a miracle. Have a drink?</p>
   <p>He reaches down into the desk drawer. VIVIAN I’ll have two drinks.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe grins at her. He comes up with a bottle and two glasses, fills them, and takes one to her. They salute, start to drink and find that their eyes have met over the glass rims and refuse to come apart. Vivian breaks it, not because she is shy or coy, but because suddenly there is a sadness in her face. Her gaze drops briefly, then returns to Marlowe, clear, steady, and sad.</p>
   <p>You’re a lot like Shawn Regan.</p>
   <p>Marlowe looks at her, almost with tenderness and understanding.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>You want to tell me now or later? VIVIAN What?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>What you’re so anxious to find out. VIVIAN It couldn’t be — you. MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Let’s do one thing at a time.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>(rising)</p>
   <p>I think we’ve done enough for one day…</p>
   <p>MARLOWE (gently)</p>
   <p>Want that other drink? VIVIAN</p>
   <p>(going toward door) No…</p>
   <p>Marlowe sets his glass down on the desk and picks up the envelope.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE You forgot this.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>She turns by the door as he approaches, holding out her hand for the envelope. Marlowe gives it to her, but doesn’t let go of it.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>They are not thinking about the envelope. Slowly he bends to her — she leans back against the wall, her lips parted, her eyes soft, misted with tears. Marlowe’s mouth covers hers. Presently they break — Vivian puts her hand on Marlowe’s cheek.</p>
   <p>(softly)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Your face is like Shawn’s too -clean and thin, with hard bones under it…</p>
   <p>She turns, neither slowly nor fast, away from him, opens the door, and goes out.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>Parked unobtrusively under some trees a reasonable distance from Geiger’s house. Marlowe sits patiently, waiting, his hat pushed to the back of his head, his collar loosened, smoking quietly. Presently, in b.g. in front of Geiger’s house, Carmen Sternwood appears furtively around the far end of the hedge, and goes quickly in through the gap leading to the front door. Marlowe reacts, then gets out, to follow her.</p>
   <p>69. MED. CLOSE SHOT - CARMEN</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>standing in an attitude of terror, her back pressed against the wall beside the front door to Geiger’s house, staring at Marlowe as he enters. She raises one hand and clenches her teeth on her thumb, staring at him. The terror fades a little as she recognizes him. She wears coat, hat, veil, <emphasis>etc.</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Remember me now, don’t you? Doghouse Reilly, the man that didn’t grow very tall. Remember?</p>
   <p>CARMEN (making an effort to seem natural) Is this your doghouse? MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Sure. Let’s go inside, huh? CARMEN</p>
   <p>(shrinking, cringing) Inside?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>You wanted to get in, didn’t you? He pushes her away, unlocks the door, pushes it inward. In with you.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He shoves Carmen in ahead of him, follows. 70. INT. GEIGER’S LIVING ROOM - CARMEN AND MARLOWE</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Carmen standing, looking about the room, as Marlowe shuts the door and stands looking at Carmen. She feels him watching her, smiles at him. He doesn’t answer it. The smile fades. Marlowe takes out pack of cigarettes, offers it. She shakes her head dumbly, staring at him. He lights a cigarette.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>How much do you remember about last night?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>Remember what? I was sick last night. I was home.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Sure you were. I mean, before you went hone. In that chair yonder -on that orange shawl while they were taking pictures. Quit stalling.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(staring at him, she</p>
   <p>starts to put her</p>
   <p>thumb in her mouth</p>
   <p>again)</p>
   <p>And stop biting your thumb too. CARMEN You — were the one? MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Me. How much do you remember? CARMEN Are you the police? MARLOWE</p>
   <p>No. I’m a friend of your father’s. (a moment)</p>
   <p>Who killed him?</p>
   <p>CARMEN (faintly)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Who else… knows? About Geiger? Not the police, or they’d be camping here.</p>
   <p>(a moment)</p>
   <p>Maybe Joe Brody.</p>
   <p>CARMEN Joe Brody? Who’s he?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Sure. Not Steve Brody: Joe Brody. Did Joe kill him?</p>
   <p>CARMEN Kill who?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Look sister. I don’t know how much trouble you are accustomed to, but I hope you’ve had plenty of practice dodging it.</p>
   <p>CARMEN (nods her head) Yes. Joe did it. MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Why? (she watches him</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>out of the corners</p>
   <p>of her eyes, biting her thumb; he draws on cigarette, expels)</p>
   <p>Seen much of him lately?</p>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>No! I hate him!</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>So you’re all ready to tell the cops he did it, huh?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(quickly, as she</p>
   <p>stares at him)</p>
   <p>That is, if we can just get rid of that photograph Geiger made last night.</p>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>Photograph? What photograph?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(drags at cigarette,</p>
   <p>expels smoke)</p>
   <p>Just like last night. What a scream we are. Sternwood and Reilly, two stooges in search of a comedian.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>Your name isn’t Reilly. It’s Marlowe. Vivian told me.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>So you are beginning to remember. And you came back to look for the photograph, but you couldn’t get into the house.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(she stares at him)</p>
   <p>The photo’s gone. I looked for it last night. Brody took it with him.</p>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>I’ve got to go home now.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Sure. But I wouldn’t tell the police about Brody yet. Don’t even tell a soul you were ever here -either last night, or today. Net even Vivian. Leave it to Doghouse Reilly. Where’s your car?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>On the back street, where nobody would see it.</p>
   <p>She turns to go out as he turns to follow.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>You’re not going to tell anybody we were here, are you?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>(gives him a swooning look) It depends. I never tell on people who are nice to me.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>She gives him a languishing, swooning, inviting look, so that her attitude is a caricature of what her more brilliant and vivid sister’s might be. Marlowe grasps her arm almost savagely, turns her toward the door.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Come on. Get out of here -He stops; they both react as FEET SOUND beyond the doer, approaching, they pause dead as the BELL RINGS. While they stand staring at each other, Carmen drooling almost with terror, the BELL RINGS AGAIN, ceases, then SOUND of KEY at the lock and a moment later the door opens and EDDIE MARS enters quickly and then stops dead, staring at them. He is a handsome, hard, horsy-looking man in beautiful, restrained, expensive clothes, who stands staring at them with complete composure for a moment. Then he looks at Carmen, shuts the door, takes his hat off.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>Excuse the casual entrance. The bell didn’t answer. Is Mr. Geiger around?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>No. We don’t knew just where he is. We found the doer open and stepped in.</p>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>I see. Friends of his?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Just business. We dropped in for a book.</p>
   <p>Mars stares hard at Marlowe, who stares just as hard back.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>But we missed him.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(takes Carmen’s arm, pushes her toward door to pass Mars)</p>
   <p>So we’ll trot along.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>As Marlowe is about to shoulder Mars aside to pass, Mars himself steps aside until Carmen has passed him, then he moves in between Marlowe and the door.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>The girl can go. But I’d like to talk to you a little.</p>
   <p>Marlowe stares at him, then makes a slight motion toward the gun inside his coat.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>Don’t try it. I’ve got two boys outside in the car.</p>
   <p>He turns, opens the door, Carmen scuttles through it. Mars shuts the door behind her, looks about the room.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>(puts hat back on)</p>
   <p>There’s something wrong around here. I intend to find out what it is. If you want to pick lead out of yourself, go ahead.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE A tough guy.</p>
   <p>Mars makes no answer. He walks on into the room, looking around. Marlowe watches him.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I suppose it’s all right if I smoke.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Mars does not answer. He looks about, sees the totem pole, is astonished, approaches it, stops suddenly as he moves the small rug over the bloodstain with his foot, then kneels swiftly out of sight for an instant beyond the desk. When he rises, he is facing Marlowe and his hand is just emerging from inside his coat, holding a Luger pistol.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>Blood. On the floor there, under the rug. Quite a lot of blood.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(in interested tone) Is that so?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Mars slides into the chair behind the desk, still watching Marlowe, hooks the telephone toward him with the pistolbarrel, then shifts the pistol to his left hand and puts his right hand on the phone but without raising it.</p>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>I think we’ll have some law. Marlowe approaches while Mars watches him, and looks down at the stain, pretends to have seen it for the first time. MARLOWE</p>
   <p>That’s old blood. Dried. MARS</p>
   <p>Just the same, we’ll have some law. MARLOWE Why not?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>Just who are you anyway? Marlowe’s the name. I’m a private detective.</p>
   <p>MARS Who’s the girl?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>A client. Geiger was trying to throw a loop on her. We came to talk it over. He wasn’t here.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>Convenient — the door being open, when you didn’t have a key.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Wasn’t it? By the way, how’d you happen to have one?</p>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>Is that any of your business? MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I could make it my business. MARS</p>
   <p>(smiles tightly)</p>
   <p>And I could make your business mine.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>You wouldn’t like it. The pay’s too small.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>I own this house. Geiger is my tenant. Now what do you think of it?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>You know some nice people. MARS</p>
   <p>I take them as they come.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(he glances down at the pistol, shrugs, puts</p>
   <p>it back inside coat)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Got any ideas, detective? One or two. Somebody gunned Geiger. Somebody got gunned by Geiger, who ran away. Or Geiger was running a cult and made blood sacrifices in front of that barber pole there. Or he had meat for dinner and does his butchering in the front parlor.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(Mars scowls at him)</p>
   <p>All right. I’ll give up, then. Call your friends downtown.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>I don’t get it. I still don’t get your game here.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Don’t you, Mr. Mars? Mars stares et Marlowe, who meets his stare steadily. Mars’ face is now hard.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>You seem to be telling me Geiger was in a racket of some sort. What racket?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I don’t know. I’m not his landlord. And I’ll tell you something else you missed. Somebody cleaned out whatever was in that back room in his bookshop today.</p>
   <p>Mars stares at Marlowe a long moment. Marlowe takes out a cigarette deliberately, is starting to light it. MARS You talk too much.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>While Marlowe stands, the cigarette in his mouth, the matchbox resting in his hands, Mars suddenly whips out the pistol again, holds it on Marlowe, and whistles shrilly. SOUND of car door SLAMMING OFF, then RUNNING FEET.</p>
   <p>MARS Open the door.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Open it yourself. I’ve already got a client.</p>
   <p>Mars rises, still holding the pistol on Marlowe, crosses toward the door as the SOUND OF FEET reaches the door and the knob is rattled from outside. Mars reaches the door, opens it. Two men plunge into the room, already reaching inside their coats. One is a young hoodlum, good-looking, pale-faced boy, the other is older, slim, deadpan.</p>
   <p>MARS (jerks his head at Marlowe) Look him over…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The slim man flicks out a short pistol, covers Marlowe. The boy approaches, searches Marlowe, who turns, helping the boy search him with the burlesqued air of a bored beauty modeling a gown in a shop.</p>
   <p>BOY Okay. No iron. MARS Find who he is. The boy draws Marlowe’s wallet from his breast pocket, flips it open, studies the contents.</p>
   <p>BOY A shamus.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He strikes. Marlowe, moving faster, catches his wrist, wrenches it suddenly and sharply, so that in the next instant the wallet is in Marlowe’s hand. The boy reacts angrily, but Mars stops it.</p>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>(sharply)</p>
   <p>That’ll do. Beat it. The boy stops sullenly, glaring at Marlowe. MARS</p>
   <p>(coldly vicious) I said, outside.</p>
   <p>The two guards withdraw, exit. MARS All right. Talk.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe deliberately finishes lighting the cigarette, inhales.</p>
   <p>Not to you. I told you I’ve already got a client.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>Who was it cleaned out the back of Geiger’s store?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Quite a shower yesterday. Did it rain up there at Las Olindas?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>(slaps the pistol</p>
   <p>angrily down on</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>the desk)</p>
   <p>I might even make it worth your while to talk to me.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>That’s the spirit. Leave the gun out of it. I can always hear money. How much of it are you clinking at me?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>(slams the desk</p>
   <p>again with the</p>
   <p>flat pistol)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>I ask you a question, and you ask me another. My guess is, you need some help yourself. So cough up.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Not me. It’s Geiger’s kinfolk that need help — provided a man like Geiger had anybody who loved him and will care who bumped him off. So I’d better give what I know to the Law. Which puts it in the public domain and don’t leave me anything to sell. So I guess I’ll drift.</p>
   <p>Marlowe makes a move to lift the gun, but does not.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(easily)</p>
   <p>By the way, how’s Mrs. Mars these days?</p>
   <p>Mars’ hand jerks at the gun, almost lifts it, pauses. He glares at Marlowe.</p>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(almost whispers: raging inside)</p>
   <p>Beat it. Get out of here.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe moves easily and unhurriedly toward the door. 7l. EXT. STREET - BEFORE GEIGER’S HOUSE</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>as Marlowe gets into his car. A short distance behind it Mars’ car is parked, the two guards in it. Marlowe drives away. He expects a shot perhaps. As he drives away he burlesques it: holds his hand out the window as if he were testing the air for rain. He drives on.</p>
   <p>DISSOLVE TO: 72. INT. MARLOWE’S OFFICE - EVENING - MARLOWE</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>sitting at his desk, the phone pulled up in front of him. He smokes nervously — he seems to have been waiting some time — and glances at his wristwatch. The PHONE RINGS. He grabs it.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Yeah… What’s the news?… Nothing</p>
   <p>— you mean they haven’t called you?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(smiling sardonically)</p>
   <p>Mrs. Rutledge… You are not a very good liar. I thought you were going to trust me…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(jerking the phone</p>
   <p>away from his ear</p>
   <p>with exaggerated</p>
   <p>haste)</p>
   <p>Why, Mrs. Rutledge!</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The PHONE CLICKS LOUDLY as the other end is slammed down on the hook. Marlowe replaces his instrument slowly. He is not clowning now. He speaks softly to the telephone as though to Vivian herself, half in admiration, half in anger.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE You crazy darn fool…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He picks up his hat and goes out. 73. EXT. RANDALL PLACE - NIGHT</p>
   <p>on Marlowe, parked a few doors from the Randall Arms, obviously waiting for something.</p>

   <p>76. INT. UPPER RAILWAY - AT STAIRHEAD - NIGHT</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>as Marlowe climbs the last steps. He walks down the hall to 405 and presses the bell. In one of the other apartments a radio plays softly. Presently the door of 405 opens noiselessly, just wide enough to show the man who stands behind it — JOE BRODY, whom we have seen before, in the back room of Geiger’s store and later driving the panel truck. He looks steadily at Marlowe and does not speak. His right hand holds the door. A cigarette smolders in the corner of his mouth.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Geiger?</p>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>(after a pause, deadpan) You said what?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Geiger. Arthur Gwynne Geiger. The guy with the blackmail racket.</p>
   <p>Brody’s right hand drops slowly out of sight — we get the impression he’s reaching for a gun.</p>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>Don’t know anybody by that name. Marlowe gives him a hard smile. Brody doesn’t like the smile.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE You’re Joe Brody? BRODY So what?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>So you’re Joe Brody — and you don’t know anybody named Geiger. That’s very funny.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>Yeah? You got a funny sense of humor, maybe. Take it away and play it somewhere else.</p>
   <p>Marlowe leans against the door and gives him a dreamy smile.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>You got Geiger’s stuff, Joe. I got his sucker list. We ought to talk things over.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>(glancing sideways</p>
   <p>into the room, then back to Marlowe)</p>
   <p>There’s plenty of time to talk. Make it tomorrow, bud.</p>
   <p>He starts to close the door. Marlowe bares his teeth and shoves the door in against Brody, viciously.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE (pleasantly) We’ll make it now. 77. INT. BRODY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>A pleasant room, nicely furnished. French windows open onto a balcony; near the windows a closed door, and near the entrance another door with a heavy curtain drawn across it. Marlowe closes the entrance door behind him, not taking his eyes from Brody. Brody stands still, his hand frozen underneath his coat, his eyes wolfish. Presently he breaks, letting his hand drop.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>(shrugging — turning away) Why not, if you think you got something.</p>
   <p>Marlowe smiles, glancing at the curtained doorway. A woman’s shoes show below the edge.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE You alone, Joe?</p>
   <p>BRODY (meaningfully) Yeah.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe lifts the curtain, high enough to show a very spiffy leg — Vivian’s, in fact. He admires it. I could be alone with that almost any time.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He drops the curtain again, goes to the davenport, and sits down, tossing his hat beside him. Brody picks up a box of cigars from a nearby table, walks to an easy chair opposite Marlowe, and sits.</p>
   <p>BRODY Well, I’m listening. He drops his cigarette stub into a tray and puts a cigar between his lips.</p>
   <p>BRODY Cigar?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He tosses one to Marlowe through the air. As Marlowe reaches out to catch it Brody takes a Police Special out of the cigar box and covers Marlowe, who relaxes slowly, like a steel spring.</p>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>Okay, stand up. Slow. MARLOWE</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(not moving, smiling</p>
   <p>sardonically)</p>
   <p>My, my — such a lot of guns around town, and so few brains. You’re the second guy I’ve met today who seems to think a gat in the hand means the world by the tail.</p>
   <p>(derisively)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Put it down, Joe.</p>
   <p>(as Joe doesn’t move,</p>
   <p>only looks nastier)</p>
   <p>The other guy’s name is Eddie Mars. Ever hear of him?</p>
   <p>BRODY No.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>If he ever gets wise to where you were last night in the rain — you’ll hear of him.</p>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>(deadpan, but</p>
   <p>lowering the gun)</p>
   <p>What would I be to Eddie Mars? Not even a memory.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>Don’t get me wrong. I’m not a tough guy — just careful.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>You’re not careful enough. That play with Geiger’s stuff was terrible. I saw it, you know. I don’t think Geiger’s boy friend liked it.</p>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>Carol Lundgren? That punk. MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Yeah. Punk burns, sometimes.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(raises his voice</p>
   <p>to the curtain door)</p>
   <p>You might as well come out, Vivian. Brody decided not to shoot me just yet.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(as the curtain parts</p>
   <p>slightly to show</p>
   <p>Vivian, undecided)</p>
   <p>Oh, yeah, and bring the blonde with you.</p>
   <p>Vivian comes out, followed by Agnes. Vivian looks strained, angry, indomitable. Agnes looks merely vicious. MARLOWE (to Agnes)</p>
   <p>Hello, sugar.</p>
   <p>AGNES (sourly)</p>
   <p>Hello — trouble!</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Agnes flounces down on the arm of an overstuffed chair. Brody watches, his eyes hard and narrow, expressionless. Vivian stands looking down at Marlowe. She is definitely not glad to see him.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>So you don’t really believe in miracles — or me.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>I’ve learned not to believe in anything. I don’t need you, Marlowe. I don’t know how you got here, but I don’t want you. Will you get out?</p>
   <p>But darling, the man with the gun won’t let me. Look — he’s all bothered and curious, wondering about stuff.</p>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>(menacingly)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Yeah — you bet I’m wondering. (looking sharply</p>
   <p>from Vivian to</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe, then</p>
   <p>to Agnes)</p>
   <p>Agnes — put some more light on so</p>
   <p>I can see to shoot if I have to. (to Vivian, as</p>
   <p>Agnes switches</p>
   <p>on a floor lamp)</p>
   <p>You — sit down, and keep quiet.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>Joe, I swear I didn’t have anything to do…</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(attempting to draw</p>
   <p>her down beside him)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Don’t argue with the man. Here… (taking Vivian’s handbag, hefting it to assure</p>
   <p>himself the wad of</p>
   <p>bills is still inside,</p>
   <p>and grinning with</p>
   <p>satisfaction, placing</p>
   <p>bag on couch)</p>
   <p>Sit on this, baby… Go ahead. You won’t need it.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>Marlowe, you’re ruining everything.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE (finally losing patience, yanking her down bodily)</p>
   <p>Sit down!</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Vivian struggles with him angrily. Marlowe puts his arm around her and smiles mockingly at Brody, who raises his gun slightly, with unpleasant significance.</p>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>Okay, fella. Give out.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(shaking his head)</p>
   <p>Uh-uh, Joe — you’re doing the giving.</p>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>(leaning forward, menacingly) Listen…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Sure, sure — You’re the hard boy with the gun. Okay — go ahead, blow holes in me. That won’t take the cops off your neck.</p>
   <p>BRODY What cops?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>The cops that are going to find out where all that lead in Geiger came from.</p>
   <p>He rises, pacing with nervous catlike energy as he talks, his sheer ease and conviction holding Brody motionless.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>You shot Geiger, last night in the rain. The trouble is he wasn’t alone when you whiffed him. Either you didn’t notice that — and I think you did — or you got scared and ran. But you had nerve enough to take the plate out of his camera, and you had nerve enough to come back later and hide his corpse, so you could clean out his store before the law knew it had a murder to investigate.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>(dangerously quiet)</p>
   <p>It’s kind of lucky for you I didn’t kill Geiger.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>You can hold your breath for it, just the same.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>You think you got me framed. Don’t go simple on me, Joe. I told you there was a witness.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>(suddenly seeing the light) Carmen! That little… She would -just that!</p>
   <p>Vivian reacts to this — Marlowe puts his hand strongly on her shoulder, holding her quiet!</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(laughing)</p>
   <p>I thought you had that picture of her.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>For a moment nobody moves. There is a feeling of predatory animals; caged and waiting. Vivian looks slowly up into Marlowe’s face. Then Brody puts his gun down on an end table by his chair.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>Let’s all calm down here. Let’s all just sit quiet a minute and think.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(to Marlowe)</p>
   <p>Who are you? And what do you get out of this?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I’m just a guy paid to do other people’s laundry. And all I get out of it is those pictures of Carmen.</p>
   <p>BRODY What pictures? MARLOWE (as to a child) Oh, Joe!</p>
   <p>He sits down beside Vivian again, talks to her as though Brody were not present.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>How do you like that? He drops the whole thing in my lap, and then he says “What pictures”?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(to Agnes)</p>
   <p>Poor Aggie. I hate to think of you standing outside the gas chamber watching him while he chokes.</p>
   <p>(to Brody) Joe…</p>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>Shut up.</p>
   <p>(to Marlowe)</p>
   <p>How did you get to me?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I never saw so many streets leading to one place in my life. Everywhere I turn I fall over Joe Brody — and I been doing a lot of turning.</p>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>So Carmen says I gunned him.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>With the photos in hand, I might be able to convince her she was wrong.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>(after a pause, scowling) I’m not saying I have or haven’t got the photos. I’m only saying I’m broke. Agnes and I are down to nickels, and we got to move on for a while till this Geiger thing cools off.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>No dough from my client. BRODY</p>
   <p>(to Vivian — with</p>
   <p>cold fury)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>So you did go to somebody after all. (rising)</p>
   <p>All right! I don’t need your five</p>
   <p>grand. I can take you off my back,</p>
   <p>Marlowe, and I can get the cops taken</p>
   <p>off. I got a connection, see? I got</p>
   <p>a handle on something big enough to</p>
   <p>turn this town upside down -</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Why haven’t you pulled it?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>I’m going to. And what I get out of it will make your five grand look like a roll of nickels.</p>
   <p>Joe — you’re not gonna do it. You can’t go up against Eddie Mars, he’ll -</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>(furiously)</p>
   <p>Shut up! You have to let that big mouth run off in front of -</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He is interrupted by the sudden RINGING of the DOORBELL. They hold it, all of them apprehensive of who may be on the other side of the door, while the RINGING STOPS and becomes an insistent rapping. Brody jerks open a desk drawer and draws out a bone-handled automatic, which he hands out to Agnes. She takes it, shaking nervously. Brody indicates Marlowe.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>(to Agnes)</p>
   <p>If he gets funny, use your own judgment — and the dame, too.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Agnes sits on the arm of the davenport beside Marlowe, the gun out of sight against him. Marlowe, observing her shaking hand, is not happy. Brody puts his own gun in his pocket, leaving his hand on it, and opens the door. Carmen Sternwood pushes him back in the room, using a tiny revolver which she pushes against his hips. Carmen kicks the door shut behind her; Agnes leaps up, standing out of Marlowe’s reach, her gun wavering between him and Carmen. She remains oblivious of the other people in the room. Vivian reacts to her entrance, but says nothing. Marlowe sits still, automatically stroking the sleepy cat.</p>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(to Brody, with quiet viciousness)</p>
   <p>I want my pictures, Joe.</p>
   <p>Brody is scared, playing it very easy, backing up as she follows him.</p>
   <p>BRODY Take it easy, Carmen. MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(sharply, eyeing Agnes) Carmen…</p>
   <p>AGNES</p>
   <p>(to Carmen)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Get away from him, you. Vivian rises sharply, also getting out of Marlowe’s reach; she whips a small automatic out of her coat pocket.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>(to Agnes, trying to watch her and Brody at the same time)</p>
   <p>Let her alone.</p>
   <p>(to Brody, moving</p>
   <p>toward him)</p>
   <p>Joe, if you dare to hurt her…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>This is cute. Hasn’t anybody else got a gun? — We can play ring around the roses.</p>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(ignoring them</p>
   <p>all — to Brody)</p>
   <p>You shot Arthur Geiger. I saw you. I want my pictures.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>For Pete’s sake, all of you -relax!</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>No one hears him. The three women continue to behave like nervous cats — the lead may start flying at anybody, any minute. Brody still has his hand in his pocket; he may blast Carmen — and Marlowe, gunless, sits in the middle of the possible crossfire. Vivian is closer to him than Agnes, having moved beyond the hampering arm of the couch. Marlowe moves abruptly. Grabbing the couch cushion which Vivian has just vacated, he slings it at Agnes, knocking her off balance and down.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Almost as a continuation of the same movement Marlowe makes a dive for Vivian’s legs. She falls on top of him, they struggle for the gun, and Vivian bites Marlowe’s wrist. He whacks her across the side of the head with his free hand, wrenches the gun free and stands up. Carmen’s attention has been distracted slightly by this dust-up, and Brody strikes at her gun hand. The gun goes off, making a small sharp crack, shattering a pane of glass in the French windows, then skitters out of Carmen’s hand and across the floor. Agnes lets go a frightened bleat and collects herself, about to fire at Carmen. Marlowe makes a quick rush, kicks the gun out of her hand, and puts his foot on Carmen’s gun just as Carmen gets there, her hands and knees, reaching. She puts her hand on Marlowe’s foot, and then looks up at him, sidewise, and giggles. He bends over and pats her on the back.</p>
   <p>Get up, angel. You look like a Pekinese.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>She draws back and rises as Marlowe scoops up her gun with his left hand and drops it in his pocket. The gun he has taken from Vivian still dominates the room.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Everybody — stand still.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>They do, and he walks over and picks up Agnes’ gun, sticking that on in his hip pocket. Brody is wiping the nervous sweat off his face — Agnes and Vivian still crouch half stunned on the floor. Marlowe laughs.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>My, don’t we have fun! You can get up now, kiddies.</p>
   <p>(walking over to Brody) All right, Joe. Give.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Brody goes sullenly to the desk, opens a secret compartment, and pulls out a fat envelope, hands it to Marlowe. Marlowe glances at the contents.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Sure this is all of it?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>Yeah. Now will you dust, so I can air out the room?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe turns as the Sternwood girls approach him. Carmen gives him a languishing smile and holds out her hand for the envelope.</p>
   <p>CARMEN Can I have them now? MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I’ll take care of them for you. He hands the envelope to Vivian, who thanks him with her eyes.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(to Carmen and Vivian) You’d better go on home now. Carmen continues to look at him, sidelong, biting her thumb. CARMEN</p>
   <p>You’ll take care of Carmen, won’t you?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Check. CARMEN</p>
   <p>Could I have my gun back?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Later.</p>
   <p>CARMEN You’re awfully cute. MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Yeah.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(stopping Vivian</p>
   <p>as she passes</p>
   <p>him, heading</p>
   <p>toward the door)</p>
   <p>Countess — you forgot something.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He picks up her bag off the davenport and hands it to her</p>
   <p>— the scene’s almost a repetition of the one in Marlowe’s office, with Marlowe still holding the handbag.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Did I hurt your head much?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>(softly)</p>
   <p>You — and every other man I ever met.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>She goes out. Carmen follows her, but at the door she turns impulsively, flings her arms around Marlowe’s neck and kisses him.</p>
   <p>CARMEN I like you.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>She runs off down the hall. Marlowe looks at her, puzzled by her unusual attitude. He closes the door and turns again to Brody and Agnes. Agnes, considerably scratched up, gives him a snakely glare as she pats her wounds with a handkerchief.</p>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>I got enough of you, chum.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Yeah, but there’s still some unfinished business. What’s this handle you got on Eddie Mars that’s big enough to turn the town upside down?</p>
   <p>Listen — you got your pictures -you got nothing more on me. Get outta here.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Sure, I can go. You can go, too. Up to Quentin, to the big chair in the little room with the window. They stand outside, Joe, with stopwatches. They clock you in seconds, but from where you sit the centuries stink of cyanide, and they wrap around your throat, and a lot of people say it’s easier than hanging — I don’t know.</p>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>What are you trying to do?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Keep your neck out of a noose — in return for some information. Got an alibi for last night?</p>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>I was right here with Agnes.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(picking up his hat)</p>
   <p>Okay, Joe. You can only die once, even for a couple of murders.</p>
   <p>Brody stares at him as he turns to leave. Agnes is scared</p>
   <p>— she puts her hand on Brody’s shoulder.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>Wait a minute. What do you mean -a couple of murders?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>But then, you don’t have to worry, do you? You got a connection.</p>
   <p>BRODY Sit down.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(laughs, sits down</p>
   <p>on table edge)</p>
   <p>Where were you about seven-thirty last night?</p>
   <p>(sullenly)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Watching Geiger’s place, to see if he has any friends too big for me to kick out of the way when I take over his business. It’s raining hard, I’m shut up in my car, and I don’t see anything except another car parked in the alley below Geiger’s. I look at it — it’s a Buick, registered to Mrs. Rutledge. That’s all. Nothing happened, and I got tired waiting and went home.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Know where that Buick is now? BRODY How would I?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>In the Sheriff’s garage. It was fished out of twelve feet of water off Lido pier this morning. There was a dead man in it, Owen Taylor, the Sternwood’s chauffeur — the guy you got the pictures from. He’d been sapped and the car pointed out the pier and the hand throttle pulled down.</p>
   <p>Brody gives Marlowe a stricken look. Agnes tightens her grip on him.</p>
   <p>AGNES Joe, you didn’t… BRODY</p>
   <p>Shut up.</p>
   <p>(to Marlowe)</p>
   <p>You can’t hang that one on me.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I can make a good try — unless you talk and talk straight.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>All right, all right! Yeah, I heard the shots. I see this guy come slamming down the back steps with something in his hand.</p>
   <p>(MORE)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>BRODY (CONT’D)</p>
   <p>He shoots off in the Buick, and I follow him, and out of the highway he skids off the road and has to stop, so I stop too, and play cop. His nerve is bad, and I sap him down — and I figure the film might be worth something, so I take it. That’s the last I see of him.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Uh-huh — so Taylor gave Geiger the works, and ail for the love of little Carmen. Agh! The sap!… How’d you know it was Geiger he shot?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>Seemed like a good guess. When I saw what was on the film I was sure, and when Geiger didn’t show at the store this morning, Agnes and I figured it was a good time to do ourselves some business.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Yeah, you figured, all right. You businessed yourself right into a hot box.</p>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>Yeah — yeah, I guess I did.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I got connections too, you know, with the D.A.‘s office. If I know about Eddie Mars I might be able to cool you down some.</p>
   <p>AGNES</p>
   <p>(as Brody hesitates) Go on, Joe — tell him!</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>BRODY</p>
   <p>Okay. It’s kind of a funny story. It ain’t about Eddie Mars, really</p>
   <p>— it’s about his wife. I…</p>
   <p>The DOORBELL starts to RING. Brody stands up, with Agnes beside him. Marlowe stays put.</p>
   <p>BRODY So she’s back again.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>If she is, she doesn’t have her gun. Don’t you have any other friends?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>BRODY (crossing to the table, picking</p>
   <p>up the Colt) Just about one.</p>
   <p>(going angrily to the door) I got enough of this.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He opens the door about a foot, with his left hand, holding the Colt ready by his thigh. It is impossible to see who stands in the hall. Almost instantly two shots sound, close together. Brody doubles up, falls forward against the door, slamming it shut. Agnes reacts, but does not scream. Marlowe leaps up, hauls Brody away from the door</p>
   <p>— Brody is quite dead. Marlowe runs out.</p>

   <p>a quiet residential street, with trees growing heavy along the parkway. Marlowe’s car pulls in to park. Marlowe gets out into the street, crouching low, and pulls Carmen’s little gun from his pocket. He walks back the way he has come, crouching for shelter behind the line of parked cars. Aside from him the street is deserted.</p>

   <p>MARLOWE Got a match, bud?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lundgren stands still, taken by surprise, not sure what to do. His hand rises instinctively to his leather jacket, but not inside. A siren wails off, going toward the Randall Arms — Lundgren turns his head instinctively toward the sound, and Marlowe steps in against him, the little gun jammed into Lundgren’s midriff.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Me, or the cops? LUNDGREN Get away from me.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>This is a small gun, kid. I can give it to you through the belly and in three months you’ll be well enough to walk the last mile up at Quentin.</p>
   <p>Lundgren holds it, glaring at Marlowe, then relaxes.</p>
   <p>LUNDGREN What do you want? MARLOWE</p>

   <p>Lundgren gives him a hard, nasty look and laughs.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(softly)</p>
   <p>Not all friendship, was it? Yeah, money talks, all right. It talks, and it’s breath smells of blood…</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe and Lundgren stand on the footbridge. Marlowe still carries the toy gun. He pulls the keys out of his pocket with his left hand and gives them to Lundgren.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE You open it.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lundgren starts to take the keys, then slams Marlowe a quick, hard punch on the jaw. Marlowe rocks back, but doesn’t fall — he smiles and throws the gun down at Lundgren’s feet.</p>
   <p>Maybe you need this.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lundgren goes for the gun. As he bends down Marlowe steps in fast, bringing his knee up into Lundgren’s face. The force of the blow straightens Lundgren up, and Marlowe uncorks a terrific left. Lundgren falls heavily. Marlowe, unperturbed, unlocks the door, puts the gun back in his pocket, and starts to drag Lundgren inside.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lundgren is stretched out on the couch, his hands bound behind him, under his back. A single lamp shines down into his face. He has bled somewhat from the nose. Marlowe sits on the couch, twisted sideways, so that Lundgren’s head is strained back over his knee. Marlowe helps the straining by having his left hand wound in Lundgren’s hair. His manner is gentle, almost friendly.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(softly)</p>
   <p>You’re going to cop a plea, brother -don’t ever think you’re not. And when you talk, you’re going to say just what I want you to say, and nothing else. You hear me, sweetheart?</p>
   <p>Lundgren makes no reply, staring stonily into the light.</p>

   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(almost caressingly)</p>
   <p>It’s your face, Carol. You can do what you want with it.</p>

   <p>Marlowe stands at the telephone, speaking into the instrument. His face is beaded with sweat, his collar open. He smokes jerkily — we get the impression he hasn’t enjoyed slapping Lundgren around. In b.g. Lundgren lies on the couch, both hands over his face.</p>

   <p>They stand by the bed, looking down. Geiger is laid out on the bed. Two strips of Chinese embroidery cover the wounds on his breast, in the shape of a cross, his hands folded over them. The only light in the room comes from two black candles burning on either side of the bed.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>OHLS</p>
   <p>Nice gesture of friendship. Lundgren?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Yeah.</p>
   <p>Ohls bends over, lifts up the Chinese embroidery, studies Geiger’s chest, then straightens up.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>OHLS</p>
   <p>So that’s where the three slugs went out of Owen Taylor’s gun. Well, I can understand that.</p>

   <p>Let’s get out of here.</p>
   <p>93. INT. GEIGER’S SITTING ROOM - CAROL</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>sprawled sideways on the couch, leaning his head against the wall, showing signs of his recent battle with Marlowe. Marlowe sits in b.g., easily, smoking. Ohls stands over Carol. Ohls is annoyed with Marlowe, shows it in succeeding scenes.</p>

   <p>OHLS</p>
   <p>(he rouses himself)</p>
   <p>I’ve called Wilde. Come on. We’ll deliver this punk to him.</p>

   <p>Come on, Marlowe. The D.A. will want to see the man that solves single-handed what we make busts on. And on the way to him, you and I will talk a little too.</p>

   <p>Sit down, Marlowe. We’ll try to handle Captain Cronjager. But I think you’ll admit you were going a little fast, won’t you?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Thanks.</p>
   <p>He sits down, takes out a cigarette, holds it unlighted in his hand. Ohls and Cronjager stare at him.</p>

   <p>Sure. The guy they found drowned in the car shot another guy last night in your territory; a guy named Geiger who ran a racket in the back room of a bookstore on the boulevard. The punk I got in the back office worked for Geiger.</p>

   <p>You’re on the air. Let’s have it.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>That’s all. When I finally located the lad that moved the packing case out of Geiger’s back room, Geiger’s blonde secretary was with him. It was Brody. While I was trying to persuade Brody to tell what became of the packing case, the doorbell rang again and Brody opened the door and somebody shot him twice. You know the rest of it.</p>

   <p>You see, Cronjager? Even as smart as he is, he’s got to guess</p>
   <p>sometimes, too.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>My guess is the same as yours. Black mailing stuff. Geiger’s customers must have been wearing a path across that rug, coming in to knock on that locked door and pay their monthly installments.</p>
   <p>(staring at Marlowe)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>That’s right, Cronjager. Maybe Sherlock’s even going to show us his evidence for guessing that.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>That’s enough of this.</p>
   <p>(to Marlowe)</p>
   <p>So Taylor killed Geiger because he</p>
   <p>was in love with the Sternwood girl.</p>
   <p>And Brody followed Taylor, sapped</p>
   <p>him and took the photograph and</p>
   <p>pushed Taylor into the ocean. And</p>
   <p>the punk killed Brody because the</p>
   <p>punk thought he should have</p>
   <p>inherited Geiger’s business and</p>
   <p>Brody was throwing him out.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE That’s how I figure it. WILDE</p>

   <p>Marlowe takes from his coat and puts on the desk before Wilde the three notes and Geiger’s card to General Stern wood, and the notebook with its code list of names. Wilde looks at them, lights a cigar. Ohls and Cronjager rise and look at the articles over Wilde’s shoulders. Marlowe smokes quietly.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>WILDE</p>
   <p>(after a time)</p>
   <p>These notes. If General Sternwood paid them, it would be because he was afraid of something else. Do you know what he was afraid of?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE No.</p>
   <p>Wilde stares at Marlowe. WILDE</p>
   <p>(after a moment)</p>

   <p>Listen to me, son. My father was a close friend of old General</p>

   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Yeah — the big sleep. That’ll cure his grief.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>WILDE</p>
   <p>It cures all the grief… You really don’t know yet what General Sternwood wants with you?</p>

   <p>Yes. To settle this business with Geiger.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>WILDE</p>
   <p>He’s afraid that ex-bootlegger, Regan, that he took up about a year ago, is mixed up in this somewhere. What he really wants is for you to find out that Regan isn’t.</p>
   <p>Regan’s no blackmailer. I knew him.</p>
   <p>Wilde shrugs slightly.</p>

   <p>Wilde looks again at the objects, then he takes up the notebook containing the code names and addresses, opens the desk drawer, drops the book in and shuts it, pushes the other things across the desk toward Marlowe.</p>

   <p>Mrs. Mars lived in the apartment the garage belonged to. Regan was known to carry a roll, fifteen grand, in his clothes all the time -</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Yes. I had heard that.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>GREGORY</p>
   <p>It don’t seem to have been any secret to anybody that Regan was sweet on Mars’ wife.</p>

   <p>So it looks like they went off together.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>GREGORY</p>
   <p>Regan had fifteen grand in cash with him. Mrs. Mars had some rocks, and a car of her own — making two cars available. Everything disappeared but one of the cars.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>What did she look like? Have you got a photograph?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>GREGORY</p>
   <p>No… A blonde. She won’t be now though.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>What was she before she married Mars?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>GREGORY A torcher.</p>
   <p>Maybe she isn’t anything now. Maybe neither of them are.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>GREGORY</p>
   <p>You’re thinking of Eddie Mars. You’re wrong. Mars is a business man, and a good one. Jealousy’s a luxury — murdering for it, at least</p>
   <p>— that a man like Eddie Mars knows he can’t afford.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>So, as far as you’re concerned, Mars is out.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>GREGORY</p>
   <p>Mars is out. And, until something more turns up, we are too.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(rising)</p>
   <p>And so am I, it looks like. There’s no law on my book either against a man with fifteen grand going away with the woman he loves.</p>

   <p>Good morning, Mr. Marlowe. MARLOWE</p>
   <p>How’s the General this morning? NORRIS</p>
   <p>Not so well, sir. I — ah -MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Yeah? What’s on your mind?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <p>(in sort of a rush)</p>
   <p>I read the papers to him this</p>

   <p>morning. From — ah — certain items we assume that your investigation is now complete.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Yes, as regards Geiger. I didn’t shoot him, though.</p>
   <p>NORRIS Quite so, sir.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I guess you’ve called for the debris. NORRIS The debris, sir? MARLOWE</p>

   <p>Thank you, sir. Mrs. Rutledge tried several times to telephone you last night -</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I know. I was busy getting tight. NORRIS</p>
   <p>(puts hand inside coat) Quite so, sir.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(he draws out check,</p>

   <p>The General instructed me to hand you this. Will it be satisfactory?</p>

   <p>Thank you, sir. We all appreciate it. When the General is feeling better, he will thank you himself.</p>

   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Fine. I’ll come out and drink some more of your brandy. Maybe with champagne.</p>

   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>No. So you think I did? MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I came up here to ask you. MARS</p>
   <p>(stares at Marlowe) You’re kidding.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Yes, I’m kidding. I used to know Regan. You haven’t got the men for that work. And while I think of it, don’t send me any more gun punks. I might get nervous and shoot one of them.</p>
   <p>Mars stares at Marlowe, lifts glass and drinks, staring at Marlowe across the glass, lowers the glass.</p>

   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Geiger was trying to blackmail General Sternwood. I finally figured out that at least half the General’s trouble was being afraid Regan might be behind it.</p>

   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>I see. Well, Sternwood can turn over now and go back to sleep. It was Geiger’s own racket. I like to</p>

   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Maybe! There’s just one thing puzzling me, Eddie. You don’t seem in much of a rush to find your wife. From what I hear she’s not the kind of a wife a guy wants to lose. Could it be you know where she is -with Regan?</p>

The two outside ones are deserted; even the croupiers have been drawn into the crowd which is packed densely about the middle one. In the center of the crowd</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN’S HEAD can be seen as she plays her winning streak. Marlowe is watching her. On the fringe of the crowd the waiters stand also, watching. All this is a build-up to show a phenomenal run which Vivian is making. The barman leans on the bar behind Marlowe</p>

   <p>BARMAN</p>
   <p>She’s sure picking them tonight. She comes here a lot, and from the way it’s been running for her, she’s due to pick them. Put it’s been a long time since this place seen anything like that.</p>

   <p>The crowd remains breathless. Vivian leans down and shoves the whole mass of her winnings savagely onto the RED diamond of the layout, stands back. The croupier leans without haste and rapidly and skillfully counts the money, stacks it, places all but a few scattered chips and bills, rakes these into a neat pile and pushes it off the layout with his rake, leaving the bet on the RED.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Then he opens Mars’ wallet with the same detached deliberate swiftness, draws out two flat packets of thousand-dollar bills. He breaks the tape around one, counts off six bills, adds them to the unbroken packet, puts the four other bills back into Mars’ wallet and lays the wallet aside as carelessly as if it were a packet of paper matches. Mars does not touch the wallet. He stands as before, elegant, detached, courteous. The croupier spins the wheel with one hand, snaps the ball into it with the other, draws back and folds his arms.</p>

Vivian stops but makes no sound.</p>

   <p>As Marlowe and the thug stare it out tensely, two shadowy figures emerge from the shrubbery. One of them slugs Marlowe from behind. As he falls, the other grabs for Vivian, apparently about to do the same for her. She lets out a wild scream and starts shooting from the pocket. One of the thugs cries out in mingled pain and anger — in the distance people begin to shout — the noise has attracted attention.</p>

   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>(smoking nervously)</p>
   <p>So Eddie had you come all the way up here and then wouldn’t tell you what he wanted?</p>
   <p>(dryly)</p>
   <p>That’s right. I’m still lying. Suddenly she flings the cigarette out the window. VIVIAN Have you got a drink? MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Sure.(still driving,</p>
   <empty-line/>

   <p>he leans, takes a</p>
   <p>flask from dashboard compartment, hands</p>
   <p>it to her)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>(takes flask)</p>
   <p>I can’t drink like this. Stop the car.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe stops the car.</p>
   <p>(puts flask unopened</p>
   <p>back into compartment, slams it shut)</p>
   <p>I don’t want a drink. Let’s talk.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Do we need to? The General paid me off today — I’m all washed up.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN Are you?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>All right. What’s Eddie Mars got on you?</p>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(easily; lifts the</p>
   <p>handbag, slaps it)</p>
   <p>This, for instance. And tonight’s not the first time.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Which would make Eddie Mars sore. So we’ll pass that and start over. What’s he got on you?</p>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>Wittier, please, Marlowe. Wittier. MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I can’t. I’m too old to learn now.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>But not old enough to outgrow some of your other habits.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE For instance?</p>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>Killing people.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(she stares at him, secretive, while he tries to follow her, catch up with what’s going on)</p>
   <p>So you’re a killer.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Does that mean Geiger, or Brody -or maybe both of them?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Why not?</p>
   <p>(she looks at him.</p>
   <p>Suddenly her manner</p>
   <p>changes; she speaks</p>
   <p>with a quiet and</p>
   <p>complete sincerity)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>I wish I was sure you had done it. Then I could thank you — in my father’s name. He still has pride, at least.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>And you and your sister haven’t. VIVIAN</p>
   <p>(with bitter contempt)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Carmen and me…</p>
   <p>(rapidly)</p>
   <p>We’re his blood. That’s where the</p>
   <p>hurt is. That Father might die</p>
   <p>despising his own blood. It was</p>
   <p>always wild, but it wasn’t always</p>
   <p>rotten.</p>
   <p>(she pulls herself</p>
   <p>together, takes out</p>
   <p>a cigarette, slumps</p>
   <p>back in the seat as</p>
   <p>Marlowe strikes a</p>
   <p>match. But when he</p>
   <p>holds the match to</p>
   <p>her, he sees her</p>
   <p>lying back in the</p>
   <p>seat, the cigarette</p>
   <p>in her mouth, looking</p>
   <p>at him with lazy and</p>
   <p>inviting challenge.</p>
   <p>When he brings the</p>
   <p>match near, without</p>
   <p>moving she blows it</p>
   <p>out. When she speaks</p>
   <p>it is almost a whisper)</p>
   <p>Move closer.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe stares at her. After a moment he flings the dead match deliberately away, puts his arm around her, approaches his face to hers. Suddenly Vivian flings the unlighted cigarette over her shoulder toward the window, clasps him in her arms.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN Hold me close!</p>
   <p>They kiss, a long kiss. Marlowe raises his head at last. VIVIAN Where do you live? MARLOWE Hobart Arms.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN I’ve never seen it. MARLOWE Would you like to? VIVIAN Yes.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>What’s Eddie Mars got on you? She is motionless in his arms for a second. Then she flings him back with one arm, sits violently up. VIVIAN</p>
   <p>So that’s the way it is. MARLOWE That’s the way it is.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>(controls herself;</p>
   <p>takes out a wisp</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>of handkerchief</p>
   <p>and scrubs her lips</p>
   <p>savagely with it)</p>
   <p>Men have been shot for less than this, Marlowe.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Men have been shot for less than nothing. The first time we met I told you I was a detective. Get it through your lovely head. I work at it, lady. I don’t play at it.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>What makes you think Eddie Mars has anything on me?</p>
   <p>He lets you win a lot of money, then he has a gunpoke meet you in the back yard and take it all away from you. And you’re not even surprised. You don’t even thank me for saving it for you.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>Do I need to tell you what I think of you, Mister Detective?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>You don’t owe me anything. Your father paid me. I owe you something for the kiss.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>Let me congratulate you on keeping your head.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Maybe I didn’t.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN Take me home.</p>
   <p>Marlowe starts the oar again, drives on. DISSOLVE TO: 122. INT. MARLOWE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>As Marlowe enters, closing the door behind him. The only light in the room filters in from a street lamp outside. Marlowe flings his hat carelessly toward a chair, evidently out of long habit, and starts across the room toward the kitchen, in search of a drink and in too much of a hurry to bother turning on lights.</p>
   <p>123. INT. MARLOWE’S APARTMENT - REVERSE ANGLE FROM KITCHEN NIGHT</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>As Marlowe approaches, his body filling the f.g. As he reaches the kitchen door a lamp goes on suddenly behind him. He freezes, his body blocking the view of what is behind him. Then, as he turns slowly, we see past him -Carmen Sternwood sits in an armchair, the one, in fact, into which Marlowe has pitched his hat. Carmen holds it up, smiling. She wears an evening gown, more or less covered by a light wrap.</p>
   <p>(coyly)</p>
   <p>What does the hatcheck girl get for a tip?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(grimly)</p>
   <p>I’m trying to think of something appropriate — How did you get in here?</p>
   <p>CARMEN Bet you can’t guess. MARLOWE</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(bleakly, lighting a</p>
   <p>cigarette)</p>
   <p>Bet I can. You came in through the keyhole, like Peter Pan.</p>
   <p>CARMEN Who’s he?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Guy I used to know around the poolroom.</p>
   <p>CARMEN You’re cute.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>And getting cuter every minute. How did you get in?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>I showed your manager your card. I stole it from Vivian. I told him you told me to come here and wait for you.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Fine. Now tell me how you’re going to get out.</p>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>(slipping off her wrap) I’m not going.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>She looks at him — a surprisingly honest, steady look. This is a different Carmen — a puzzled, half-frightened girl who seems to be waking from a dream — not sure she wants to, but unable to help herself. Marlowe looks back at her, nastily. But he senses a difference, and his voice is surprisingly gentle when he speaks.</p>
   <p>Listen, Carmen. I’m tired. I’ve had a hard day’s work. I like you, I’m your friend, and any other time I’d be tickled to death to see you. But not now. Will you please go home?</p>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>(quietly, hungrily)</p>
   <p>Are you really my friend, Phil? MARLOWE Sure…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>I need a friend, Phil… someone to -</p>
   <p>She stops, apparently confused, groping for words. MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Someone to what, Carmen? CARMEN I don’t know.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>She looks up at him again, searching his face. As though Marlowe is a magnet, she is drawn to her feet, still looking at him. She comes close, but does not touch him.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>(almost to herself)</p>
   <p>What is it in you?… I’m afraid of you, and yet… there’s something straight and hard… Phil, I wish I’d met you before — a long time ago…</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(trying to Josh</p>
   <p>her out of it)</p>
   <p>Hey, hey… What’s all this? CARMEN</p>
   <p>I don’t know.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(angrily)</p>
   <p>Why did you have to come? I was all right. I was fine.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE And now?</p>
   <p>(almost weeping) I don’t know.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Look — you and I want to go on being friends — and you shouldn’t be here.</p>
   <p>(holding her</p>
   <p>wrap for her)</p>
   <p>Be a good girl.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>During this speech, Carmen seems to take the wrap. But the wrap falls on to the floor, revealing the fact that Carmen is holding Marlowe’s hand.</p>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>Do you think I can be a good girl? MARLOWE</p>
   <p>It doesn’t matter what I think. Carmen kisses his hand. CARMEN</p>
   <p>But don’t you want me to try? MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(trying to free his</p>
   <p>hand now)</p>
   <p>I just want you to get out of here.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>(clinging to his hand) You’ve got funny thumbs. Can I bite it?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Before he can answer, she raises his hand, starts to put his thumb into her mouth. With a sharp violent motion he flings her hand away.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Stick to your own thumb. Hasn’t it carried you all right all your life?</p>
   <p>CARMEN (obediently) All right.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>She puts her thumb in her mouth, or her hand to her face in such a way as to appear to be sucking her thumb as usual. Marlowe takes up the fallen wrap and approaches with it. Okay. Take your thumb now and get out of here.</p>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>(giggling)</p>
   <p>It’s not my thumb. See?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>She removes the object from her mouth and holds it up for him to see. It is the white queen from his set of chessmen. Marlowe stares at her for a moment, then he slaps her terrifically across the face, rocking her back. The chessman falls from her hand and she stares at Marlowe, frightened now, as he walks toward her.</p>
   <p>CARMEN Do that again.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(seething with</p>
   <p>repressed rage; almost whispering)</p>
   <p>Get out.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>Maybe if people had done that to me more often, I would have been good now.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe reaches her, grasps he arm, hurries her across to the door, jerks the door open, almost hurls her through it, flings the wrap after her, slams the door, turns the bolt as she rattles the knob, then begins to hammer on the door. He turns and crosses the room rapidly to the bath while she still beats on the door, and washes his hand savagely with soap and water, his face now actually beaded with sweat.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The KNOCKING CONTINUES. He examines his hand, is still not satisfied, jerks open shaving cabinet, looks at the innocuous bottles of mouthwash, etc., when what he needs is carbolic acid, goes to the kitchen while the knocking still continues, jerks savagely from the shelf his last bottle of whiskey.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>It is about half full. He jerks the stopper out, flings it away and pours about a dollar’s worth of expensive Scotch over his hand, flings the bottle away, returns to the living room, and while the KNOCKING STILL CONTINUES, he kneels at the hearth, lays the delicate chess piece on it and with a heavy fire-dog hammers the chess-piece into dust, still beating even after the piece has vanished, his blows at last drowning out the SOUND of the knocking on the door.</p>

   <p>So you want to know. Okay it came from your client. That satisfy you?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I haven’t got a client. General Sternwood paid me off yesterday. I’m through.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>OHLS</p>
   <p>Well, apparently he don’t think so. And he’s a friend of the D.A. and the D.A. is the chief crime prosecutor of this county, and I’m the D.A.‘s head man Friday, and all three of us tell you to lay off.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Will you tell me one more thing: Why General Sternwood thinks I haven’t laid off?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>OHLS</p>
   <p>No. But I’ll tell you what he might be thinking. That you are trying to uncover enough stuff about his family affairs to put the squeeze on him yourself.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>That’s a lie. General Sternwood never told the D.A. nor you nor anybody else that. I don’t think the message even came from General Sternwood. It was -</p>

   <p>MARLOWE</p>

   <p>I get it. Or else I lose my license and take my pick and shovel out of the mothballs. Thoughtful, he reaches out and takes a cigarette from the box.</p>
   <p>OHLS</p>
   <p>(watching him) Changed your mind, huh?</p>

Presently, while Marlowe is trying unsuccessfully to stand up, HARRY JONES comes up to him. Harry is small, hardly five feet, in a cheap snappy ‘underworld’ suit. Yet in his wizened ugly face there is independence, honesty, reliability, courage. He helps Marlowe to his feet, steadies him, hands him a handkerchief.</p>

   <p>It is deserted. Marlowe pauses at elevator, the door is open, a shabby old man is asleep on the stool. Marlowe goes on.</p>

   <p>136. CLOSE SHOT - AT FIRE DOOR - MARLOWE pushes the door open, enters stairs, door closes behind him.</p>

   <p>CANINO’S VOICE (purring)</p>
   <p>I thought you’d remember.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe steals quietly back along the wall, reaches another door, pushes it quietly. It is locked. He takes out his wallet, removes his driver’s license from its celluloid, takes the envelope and slips back the door-lock, opens the door carefully and quietly, enters, shuts the door.</p>
   <p>138. INT. OFFICE - (DIM) - MARLOWE</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>as he stands beside an inner door which is slightly open, a light burning beyond it. Through the crack in the door Harry Jones can be seen, sitting behind a shabby desk. The other man, CANINO, is not in sight at this angle. Jones is sweating; he cannot help that. But there is no fear in his voice and he is not trembling either.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CANINO’S VOICE</p>
   <p>So you go to see this peeper, this Marlowe. That was your mistake. Eddie don’t like it. And what Eddie don’t like ain’t healthy.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>JONES</p>
   <p>You know why I went to the peeper. Account of Joe Brody’s girl. She’s got to blow. That takes dough. She figured the peeper could get it for her.</p>
   <p>CANINO’S VOICE Dough for what?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>JONES</p>
   <p>You know about the night the kid bumped Brody? Well, the young Sternwood girl was there. She not only dropped in, she took a shot at Brody. Only the peeper didn’t tell the cops that. So Agnes figures it’s railroad fare for her as soon as she can get hold of the peeper. You get it?</p>
   <p>CANINO’S VOICE Sure thing. Where’s this Agnes?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>JONES</p>
   <p>What do you care? All she wants is to touch the peeper and blow -</p>

   <p>That’s right. Look at it. You’ll tell me, little man. Where’s Agnes?</p>

   <p>You win. She’s in an apartment at 28 Court. Apartment 501. I guess I’m yellow, all right.</p>

   <p>CANINO’S VOICE</p>
   <p>You just got good sense. I ain’t going to hurt her. If everything’s like you say, I’ll tell Eddie it’s all jakeloo. We’ll even dip the bill on it.</p>
   <p>As Canino’s hand comes into sight setting a whiskey bottle on the desk, Marlowe steps quickly back. CANINO’S VOICE Got a glass?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>JONES</p>
   <p>(stares at the bottle, hopeless now, sweating but still bravely)</p>
   <p>There at the cooler.</p>

   <p>As Canino enters, Marlowe steps quickly out. Canino crosses the open door. We now SEE HIM; a stocky, vicious man in brown: a killer.</p>
   <p>139. ANOTHER ANGLE - MARLOWE FLATTENED AGAINST THE WALL</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>beside the door. Jones cannot be seen now, only Canino as he takes the glass from water cooler and crosses the door again. Now he too is not visible. Marlowe follows him by SOUND ALONE as he returns to the table, clinks the bottle against the glass as he pours the drink.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CANINO’S VOICE</p>
   <p>(purring, falsely hearty) There you are. Drink her down. Mud in your eye.</p>
   <p>Jones’ breathing can be heard as he pants. When Canino speaks next, his voice is a little sharper.</p>

   <p>CANINO’S VOICE</p>
   <p>Drink it. What do you think it is</p>
   <p>— poison? I bet that Agnes of yours wouldn’t turn it down.</p>
   <p>No. (SOUND of his movement</p>

   <p>CANINO’S VOICE Lots of it.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>SOUND as Jones drinks, dies, the glass CLINKS as he drops it, his body thuds as he falls forward, gasps, chokes. Marlowe starts forward, catches himself. The other room goes dark. SOUND as Canino leaves it: his feet, the other door opens, closes again.</p>
   <p>140. GLASS DOOR - MARLOWE’S ANGLE</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The door opens on the corridor. With the light gone, the glass in the door is faintly luminous, lettering in reverse, Canino’s shadow across it. SOUND of his feet dies away. Marlowe moves swiftly toward the inner door.</p>

   <p>his hand on the switch as he turns on the light, looks for an instant at Jones sprawled dead across the desk, the whiskey bottle and overturned glass beside him. Marlowe pauses only a second. He looks about, sees what he wants, crosses to telephone, takes it up, dials hurriedly.</p>

   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Hello, Manager? This is Wallis, Police Identification Bureau, is there a girl named Agnes Lozelle registered at your place?… Well, have you got a tall blonde with green eyes, either alone, or with a little chap that weighs about a hundred pounds, green hat, gray overcoat… Yeah, must have been the wrong address.

   <p>He approaches, gingerly and carefully shifts Jones enough to reach inside his coat, is about to search Jones, the telephone rings. Marlowe pauses, thinks, makes decision, takes up phone.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(into phone)</p>
   <p>Yeah?… Hello, Agnes… Marlowe, the guy you want to see. No, he’s not here. He’s gone, beat it. But I’ve got the money. Where are you?… I don’t know where he went. Do you want the two C’s or don’t you?… In half an hour. Right. He puts the phone down, takes out his handkerchief and wipes his fingerprints off of it, crosses to the light switch, wipes it off too, turns it with the handkerchief, goes to the door, through which he came, exits.</p>

   <p>I thought you were never coming. Give me the money.</p>
   <p>Marlowe hands her folded bills. She counts them rapidly by the dash light, then puts them in her handbag.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>AGNES</p>
   <p>This is a getaway stake, copper. I’m on my way. What happened to Harry?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I told you he ran away. Canino got wise to him somehow. Forget Harry. I’ve paid for information and I want it.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>AGNES</p>
   <p>You’ll get it. Joe and I were out riding Foothill Boulevard a couple weeks ago. We passed a brown coupe, and I saw the girl who was driving. She was Eddie Mars’ wife. There was a guy with her — the watchdog, Canino. They’re people you don’t forget, even if you only saw them once. So we got curious, and Joe tailed them. About a mile east of Realito there’s a side road, and nothing around it but brush and hills. Just off the highway there’s a two-bit garage and paintshop run by a guy named Art Huck — hot car drop, likely — and a frame house behind it. That’s where Eddie Mars’ wife is holed up.</p>
   <p>(studying her coldly)</p>
   <p>You’re sure of that?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>AGNES</p>
   <p>Why should I lie?… Well, goodbye, copper — wish me luck. I got a raw deal.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Yeah. Your kind always does. He turns and opens the door to get out. DISSOLVE TO: 144. INSERT: A HIGHWAY MARKER Illuminated by the spotlight of a car. Above a black arrow the sign says:</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe approaches the garage. There is a sign on the blank side wall — Marlowe holds a flashlight on it, and we SEE the lettering of the sign:</p>
   <p>ART HUCK AUTO REPAIRS — PAINTING</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe goes round to the front. The big doors are closed, but a streak of light shows through the crack. Marlowe hesitates, then walks past them to glance at the house.</p>
   <p>157. EXT. FRAME HOUSE - MARLOWE’S ANGLE - NIGHT (RAIN)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The only signs of life are the light from the shaded windows and Canino’s brown coupe parked in front by a row of stunted trees.</p>
   <p>158. EXT. HUCK’S GARAGE - NIGHT (RAIN)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>At the door, as Marlowe goes up and hammers on it with the butt of his heavy flashlight. There is a moment of silence. Then the inside light goes off. Marlowe centers his flash in a white circle of light on the doors.</p>
   <p>HUCK</p>
   <p>(speaking through the door)</p>
   <p>Whaddaya want?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Open up, I got two flats back on the highway and only one spare.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>HUCK</p>
   <p>Sorry, mister. We’re closed up. Better try Realito.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe doesn’t appreciate this. He kicks the door, hard, and keeps on kicking it, until a second voice — Canino’s voice — speaks from close inside. Then he stops to listen.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CANINO’S VOICE</p>
   <p>Okay, Art — open up for the wise guy.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>A BOLT SQUEALS, and half the door opens inward. Marlowe’s flash outlines a gaunt hard face, Huck’s face. Then Huck swings a gun down across the flash, knocking it out of Marlowe’s hand, still burning.</p>
   <p>HUCK Kill that spot, bud.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe picks up the flash, turning it off. Light goes on inside the garage, revealing HUCK, a tall man in dirty coveralls. He backs away from the door, keeping Marlowe covered.</p>
   <p>HUCK</p>
   <p>Come inside and shut the door. 159. INT. HUCK’S GARAGE - NIGHT</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>as Marlowe closes the door behind him. There is the usual paraphernalia of a garage, and two cars. One is being painted, a spray-gun lying on the fender, the other is Carmen Sternwood’s Packard convertible. Canino lounges easily in the shadows by the bench. The RAIN BEATS on the tin roof.</p>

   <p>You can use my spare — that’ll help some.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>HUCK</p>
   <p>Listen, I told you I’m busy with a spray job…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CANINO</p>
   <p>It’s too damp for a good spray job, Art. Get moving — and take two jacks.</p>
   <p>HUCK Now wait a minute…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Canino looks at Huck with a soft quiet-eyed stare, then away again, not saying anything. Huck wilts and moves away, pulling on a raincoat and banging out with a socket wrench, a hand jack, and wheeling a dolly.</p>
   <p>Canino closes the door behind him and returns to the workbench. Marlowe watches silently, lighting a cigarette.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CANINO</p>
   <p>Bet you could use a drink. Wet the inside, and even up.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Thanks.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Canino produces a bottle and two glasses from under the bench, pours two shots, and hands one to Marlowe. They salute — Canino drinks, and Marlowe, remembering Harry Jones and the cyanide cocktail, hesitates, then drinks also.</p>
   <p>CANINO (casually) Live around here?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>No. Just got in from Reno and Carson City.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CANINO</p>
   <p>The long way round, huh? Business trip?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Partly. And in a hurry. CANINO</p>
   <p>Too bad — you may have a long wait. (reaching for Marlowe’s</p>

   <p>How about another, to pass the time. DISSOLVE TO: 160. EXTREME CLOSE - A WHEEL - NIGHT</p>

   <p>— the tire already on a spreader and loose from the rim. A man’s hands and feet working at the job viciously. The CAMERA PULLS BACK to show Art Huck as he rips out the tube. Marlowe and Canino stand almost as before, by the workbench.</p>

   <p>Huck carries the tube to an airhose and starts to fill it.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>HUCK</p>
   <p>I am busy, brother. Plenty busy.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He starts to place the tube in the galvanized tub under the hose, then turns swiftly, lifting the tube high, and brings it down over Marlowe’s head and shoulders, a perfect ringer. Marlowe, unable to reach the gun in his pocket, bends forward, trying to throw Huck over his back. Canino steps in lightly, like a dancer, his hand closed hard over the roll of coins, and hangs one with delicate precision on Marlowe’s jaw.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe’s tough — he goes on fighting, although he’s already out on his feet. Huck pulls his head back by the hair as Canino clips him again with the weighted fist. Marlowe tries, but it’s no use. He goes down and stays that way.</p>
   <p>161. INT. MARS’ HIDEOUT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>A small room, in keeping with the exterior — furnished comfortably but not luxuriously. The only light comes from a floor lamp beside the davenport where Marlowe lies. His hands are cuffed behind him, his feet roped to the leg of the davenport. He is still out, his face considerably the worse for wear. Vivian sits beside him on a straight chair, holding a half empty glass in her hand. She seems to have forgotten about it. She seems to have forgotten everything but Marlowe — who begins to come out of it. He opens his eyes presently and looks at Vivian — he doesn’t seem surprised. He winces and shuts his eyes again.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(thickly)</p>
   <p>Move the light, honey… Vivian rises and turns the light away from his face. He looks up at her again.</p>

   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>You would be Mrs. Eddie Mars… the blond that Shawn Regan didn’t run away with.</p>
   <p>Why did you have to make trouble? Eddie wasn’t doing you any harm. I was never in love with Shawn -we were just good friends. But you know perfectly well that if I hadn’t hid out here when Shawn disappeared, the police would have been certain Eddie killed him.</p>

   <p>Well, if Eddie’s such a nice guy, I’d like to talk to him without Canino around. You know what Canino will do — beat my teeth out and then kick me in the stomach for mumbling.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>You’ll get your talk, Phil. Canino’s gone for Eddie.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Leaving Art Huck within call, I suppose. Well, I suppose nobody’s luck holds forever.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(to Vivian)</p>
   <p>You could really have gone to Mexico, you know. You’d have liked it better. Blood doesn’t spatter that far. Oh, stop talking that way!</p>
   <p>Vivian and Marlowe are no longer conscious of her presence, having retired into a private world of their own.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>But then you couldn’t go, could you. The border police would have checked you through alone, and too many people might have seen you -without Shawn Regan. Much safer to come down here with Mona. Much safer — especially for Eddie Mars.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>I did it as much for you… Why wouldn’t you believe me? Why wouldn’t you stop?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Too many people tried to make me. And besides I knew Shawn Regan -and I know you.</p>
   <p>They look at each other — and Mona Mars takes herself quietly out of the room.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>Why did I have to meet you? Why out of all the men in the city, did my father have to call you in?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Things happen that way, sometimes… Light me a cigarette…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>She takes one from a table, lights it, and bends over to place it between Marlowe’s lips. Marlowe’s eyes hold her as though his hands were on her shoulders; she sits down.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(softly)</p>
   <p>You know what they’re going to do, don’t you? You know the only thing they can do.</p>
   <p>Vivian’s hands grip the shoulders of his coat. She shuts her eyes and drops her head, holding herself rigid.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(still softly)</p>
   <p>It’s not pretty, is it — even from a distance. And when you’re right on top of it, it isn’t pretty at all.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>(rising abruptly)</p>
   <p>Oh, stop it, Phil. Stop it! Nothing’s going to happen…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Mona’s in love with Eddie Mars, but you’re not. Are you going through with it?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Vivian moves away, as far from him as she can get, and stands with her back to him, rigid, staring at the curtained window as though she could see through it. Marlowe studies her, then laughs, a quiet sardonic chuckle and relaxes, leaning back on the cushion.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Pride is a great thing, isn’t it? And courage — and honor — and love. All the things you read about in the copybooks — only in the copybooks nothing ever gets tangled. The road always lies so straight, and clear, and the signs say to love and honor and be brave… Take this thing out of my mouth, will you, honey? It’s burning me.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Vivian comes slowly to him and takes the cigarette stub from his lips. She hesitates, then goes down onto the couch, dropping the cigarette on the floor. Her arms go around Marlowe, her mouth crushed to his. When she breaks for air, putting her cheek against his, she is almost crying. Marlowe is far from unmoved himself, turning his head against hers, hard.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(after a pause, whispering) Get a knife, and cut this rope off me…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Vivian rises, runs out of the room. The SOUND of a kitchen drawer being opened comes OVER from o.s., then the RATTLE of CUTLERY. Vivian returns almost at once with a knife and slashes the rope from Marlowe’s feet. Dropping the knife, she helps him get up — he’s not too steady on his legs. They cross the room together, Vivian with her arm around Marlowe. The handcuffs glittering on Marlowe’s wrists. From outside comes the SOUND of a car skidding to a stop. Mona Mars appears in the doorway, holding a gun.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MONA</p>
   <p>(quietly, without menace) Eddie is here — I think you’d better wait.</p>
   <p>162. EXTREME CLOSE - CANINO’S HAND</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>opening, playing idly with the roll of coins. The CAMERA PULLS BACK — we are still in the living room. Marlowe is sitting on the couch, Vivian beside him — his hands are still cuffed behind him, but his feet are free.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Canino leans unobtrusively against the wall — near Marlowe. Eddie Mars holds center stage, moving like a lion keyed up for the kill. Mona Mars, the gun forgotten in her hand, sits in the b.g., watching. Her face is still, intent.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>(quietly)</p>
   <p>Eddie — this is where I get off.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>You bought a ticket for the whole run, Countess — destination unknown. Keep your mouth out of this.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(to Marlowe)</p>
   <p>You’re making it tough for me, soldier.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Not me, Eddie. Murder. Murder can make things tough for anybody. You keep tripping over it, all the time.</p>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>(contemptuously)</p>
   <p>Murder! I haven’t killed anybody.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Not personally, maybe — but your hand is behind Canino’s, aiming the gun — or pouring the cyanide into Harry Jones’ glass.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(as Mars gives him</p>
   <p>a startled look)</p>
   <p>Yeah — I was there, in the next room. Canino had a gun and I didn’t, so all I could do was watch… I kind of liked Harry Jones.</p>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>You kind of like too many people, soldier.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MONA</p>
   <p>Eddie — what does he mean? What’s happened? Who was Harry Jones?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>He’s just talking. Maybe you better get out, Mona. We may have to push him around a little before we get through.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(to Mona)</p>
   <p>Yeah — push me a little, right over the edge. Eddie won’t spoil his manicure to do it — but Canino won’t mind. He’s used to having his hands dirty.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Canino leans over and slaps Marlowe hard across the face. Vivian springs up, toward Canino — Eddie Mars grabs her, looking toward Mona. Mona has never seen that look on Eddie’s face before.</p>
   <p>MARS (quietly) Get out, Mona. MONA Eddie…</p>
   <p>MARS Get out.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Mona studies him — it seems that she is looking at a stranger, a stranger who frightens her, someone evil and beyond the pale. She seems to grow in stature and dignity, even as her heart realizes how far down the wrong road it has traveled. She turns, then, slowly, and goes out. After she has gone, Vivian wrenches free from Mars’ grip. There is something rather wonderful about her now — a blazing, catlike courage. She faces Eddie Mars.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>You don’t dare go through with this, Eddie.</p>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>You think I can’t get away with it?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>You think I’m going to let you get away with it?</p>
   <p>Mars studies her, then Marlowe — realizes what the score is, and smiles sardonically.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>You women kill me. You’ll spend years and wreck lives to get something you want, and then throw it all away in a minute because some guy has a new way of putting his mouth on yours.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(sitting down,</p>
   <p>easily, smiling)</p>
   <p>All right, Countess. While we’re doing all this thinking… do you think you’re going to have a chance not to let me get away with it?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Silence as this sinks in. Vivian sits down quietly beside Marlowe, who looks at both her and Mars with a cold, cynical smile.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(laughing softly)</p>
   <p>It’s amazing how fast a beautiful friendship breaks when a dead body falls on top of it… Which one of you killed Regan? If he was shot in the back, I’ll bet on you, Eddie, because that’s the only way you could have got to him. But if he took it from the front -</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(looking at Vivian)</p>
   <p>I can see how you both would have been jealous of Mona.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Vivian stares at him, a hard, shocked look as though Marlowe is something not human. Marlowe gives it back to her — then almost at once Canino steps forward and places his hand on Marlowe’s head, bending it back, his fingers and thumb biting cruelly into Marlowe’s temples. Canino smiles, as though he is very fond of Marlowe.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CANINO</p>
   <p>(gently amused)</p>
   <p>Ever see a dick with such a one-track mind? He’s sitting right on the edge of a hole in the ground, but he still cares who killed Regan. Want to tell him, Eddie? Want to send him to bed happy?</p>
   <p>Mars makes an annoyed gesture and starts to get up, then freezes as Mona speaks from the doorway.</p>
   <p>MONA (very quietly) Eddie…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Everyone turns to look at her — there is a quality of fate in her voice. She leans almost negligently against the door jamb, wearing a heavy coat, holding a big felt hat in her hands.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MONA</p>
   <p>I’ve been a good wife to you, Eddie</p>
   <p>— as good a wife as you’d let me be. I believed in you, and there wasn’t anything I wouldn’t have done for you — anything but this.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARS</p>
   <p>Don’t be a fool, Mona. Can’t you see…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MONA</p>
   <p>(slowly)</p>
   <p>I can only see one thing. I’ve been married to a killer, and I’ve helped him kill.</p>
   <p>She turns and goes out. Mars rises, looking after her. MARS</p>
   <p>(to Canino)</p>
   <p>Hold the fort, Canino. I’ll be back.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He goes out after Mona, not even waiting for Canino’s nod of assent. Canino goes to a window and peers through the crack of the blind, still keeping Marlowe covered. We HEAR a car start outside and drive off.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CANINO</p>
   <p>(sardonically)</p>
   <p>He made it. And he can talk about love.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He turns back into the room. Vivian has risen, she stands by a table lighting a cigarette with a wooden match from a box which she retains in her left hand.</p>
   <p>163. INSERT MATCH BOX IN VIVIAN’S HANDS:</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>An ordinary small box of matches. The cover has been pushed almost shut, leaving the head of one match protruding.</p>
   <p>Vivian holds the flaming match with which she has just lighted her cigarette to the uncovered match head, igniting it.</p>
   <p>164. INT. MARS HIDEOUT - THE LIVING ROOM</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>As Vivian blows out the first match and drops it casually into an ash tray, shielding the box in her hand from Canino’s view. Canino strolls back, looking Marlowe over with sadistic humor.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CANINO</p>
   <p>I don’t really mind the boss leaving. I can have a lot more fun alone.</p>
   <p>165. INSERT MATCH BOX IN VIVIAN’S HAND: The match has burned back, charring the paper cover. Smoke rises from the box.</p>
   <p>166. INT. MARS HIDEOUT - THE LIVING ROOM</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN Canino -</p>
   <p>CANINO</p>
   <p>(looking around, grinning) Save your breath, baby -</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The match box bursts into flame. Vivian hurls it into Canino’s face, then turns aside, clutching her scorched fingers.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>(over above action) Phil!</p>
   <p>Marlowe throws himself forward into Canino’s legs — they roll, struggling.</p>
   <p>167. CLOSE SHOT - MARLOWE AND CANINO</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>as Canino comes out on top of Marlowe, at an angle, and whips his pistol down at Marlowe’s head. Marlowe wrenches aside — the gun barrel misses by a fraction, smacking hard on the carpet. Marlowe doubles his knees into his chest and lets go with his feet, getting both heels under Canino’s jaw. Canino goes backward and down, dropping his gun, but he’s not clear out — the blow was glancing. He grabs Vivian as she tries to get by him, pulling her down. Marlowe manages to get the gun in his shackled hands. Canino pulls another, fires at him, misses, tangled up with Vivian. Marlowe makes it out the door.</p>
   <p>168. EXT. MARS HIDEOUT - AT THE FRONT DOOR - NIGHT (RAIN)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>As Marlowe comes out and runs down the steps toward Canino’s car. Over by the garage Art Huck stands, scared but undecided. Marlowe snaps a shot at him. Huck makes up his mind in a hurry. He vanishes — a second later we HEAR a car start and race off down the highway, o.s. Marlowe, working fast but awkwardly because of the handcuffs, opens the door of Canino’s car, backs in.</p>
   <p>169. INT. CANINO’S CAR - NIGHT (RAIN) - MARLOWE</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>fumbling for the ignition key and starter button, behind him. He starts the motor, then slides out again, quickly, hugging the ground by the rear wheels, offside.</p>
   <p>170. EXT. MARS HIDEOUT - MARLOWE’S ANGLE - NIGHT (RAIN)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>As a darkened window goes up. THREE SHOTS are fired from it. We HEAR the whine of the bullets, their impact on the coupe. Marlowe cries out as though hit. Then again there is silence, except for the beating rain and the purring motor.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Presently the house door opens — there is no light behind it. Vivian appears, walking stiffly, and behind her is Canino, shielded from possible fire. They walk slowly toward Marlowe and the car.</p>
   <p>CANINO Can you see anything?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>(tonelessly)</p>
   <p>Nothing. The windows are all misted.</p>
   <p>They come steadily closer to the dark car. Suddenly Vivian stops, rigid, and lets go a thin, tearing scream. VIVIAN</p>
   <p>Behind the wheel!</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(as though pleading with Marlowe not to fire)</p>
   <p>Phil!</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Canino shoves her roughly aside, dropping to one knee, and pours three SHOTS through the car window. His gun is now empty. No shots answer him — he is satisfied that Marlowe is dead. He rises, moving to open the car door, as Marlowe emerges from behind the car.</p>
   <p>Finished?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Canino whirls around, and Marlowe, the gun pressed awkwardly against his side, puts four bullets in him. He collapses into the mud and stays there.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE (to Vivian)</p>
   <p>Get the keys, honey.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Vivian, white-faced and silent, gets the keys from Canino’s pocket and unlocks the handcuffs. Marlowe rubs his wrists</p>
   <p>— they look at each other, both tired and drained of emotion — there seems to be nothing to say.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(quietly)</p>
   <p>You played that hand all right, Countess.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>(dully)</p>
   <p>I don’t know why I cared.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>She turns and walks away from him toward the garage and her car, not looking back. Presently Marlowe goes back into the house.</p>
   <p>FADE OUT. FADE IN: 171. INT. STERNWOOD HALL - MORNING - NORRIS AND MARLOWE As Norris stands in the open door, in the act of admitting Marlowe.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>The General sent for me…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <p>Yes, sir. He’s waiting, in the orchid house.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe enters, walking along the hall toward the rear with Norris. Subtly, Norris has the air of a guard. Marlowe looks tired and somber, the marks of last night’s encounter still plain on his face. He has obviously not been home; he wears the same rumpled suit, no tie, and he has not shaved. Vivian comes out of an adjoining room, as though she has been waiting, and stops them.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>I’d like to see you, Mr. Marlowe. She gives Norris the nod — he goes away, and Marlowe follows Vivian into the room, closing the door. 172. INT. SMALL SITTING ROOM - MARLOWE AND VIVIAN</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lavishly furnished. Vivian also looks exhausted, stony, but giving an impression of submerged but volcanic emotion. She does not look at Marlowe.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN Well?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I kept you out of it. I told a straight story, and Canino left his thumbprint on Harry Jones’ door to back me up. I don’t know whether they believed me, but there’s nothing they can do about it. I’m clear -self defense. And all Eddie Mars has to say is that Canino was roughing me on his own time.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>(looking at him</p>
   <p>now, forced to</p>
   <p>admire him)</p>
   <p>It wasn’t as easy as you make it sound.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(shrugging)</p>
   <p>My neck is usually stuck out, one way or another. It’s a little tougher than the General’s, that’s all.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(after an uncomfortable</p>
   <p>pause)</p>
   <p>It’s too bad Father can’t know what you’ve done for him. I’m afraid he’s… angry with you.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Why not? Everybody else is. VIVIAN</p>
   <p>You — won’t say anything to him? Of course not. VIVIAN Phil…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(brutally)</p>
   <p>Listen… I’m tired. I killed a man last night. I stink of cops, and I’ve still got a rotten taste in my mouth. I want a hot bath with strong soap, and I can’t have it until I’ve seen your father. Do you mind if I go now?</p>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>(going close to him)</p>
   <p>Phil — I didn’t kill Shawn Regan. MARLOWE (cold, deadpan) Is he dead?</p>
   <p>Vivian stares at him, getting a slow, deadly look in her eyes.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>(very calmly)</p>
   <p>It’s quite possible. He’s been gone a long time, and he’s not a peaceful man.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(turning away)</p>
   <p>I’ll send you my personal check in the morning, Mr. Marlowe.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Your personal check?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>I’m sure my father would wish you to be repaid for your… extra services, last night.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(quietly, after pause) I’m sure your father would know better… and I know you do -What about Eddie Mars?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN What about him? You think he’s going to forget all this?</p>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>I’m tired, too. Get out, Marlowe. Marlowe shrugs, goes toward the door. He speaks over his shoulder with an air of casual politeness.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE How’s Carmen?</p>
   <p>Vivian, her back to him, takes the question just a little too easily.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>She’s fine. She went up to Santa Barbara last night.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>That ought to be nice for her. VIVIAN Yes.</p>
   <p>There seems to be nothing more to say. Marlowe exits. DISSOLVE TO: 173. INT. STERNWOOD REAR GARDEN - DAY - MARLOWE AND NORRIS</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>as they walk down the path toward the orchid house. Marlowe glances around, apparently looking for something he doesn’t see. Norris opens the door, permitting Marlowe to pass him into the greenhouse.</p>
   <p>174. INT. ORCHID HOUSE - MARLOWE</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>As he follows the path between the banks of orchids to the place where General Sternwood sits, as before — in the wheelchair, wrapped in robe and blanket — only his eyes are alive, proud and piercing.</p>
   <p>STERNWOOD Sit down, Mr. Marlowe.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe pulls up a chair, already beginning to suffer with the heat. He starts to remove his coat, then something in Sternwood’s attitude makes him change his mind.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>I didn’t ask you to look for Shawn Regan.</p>
   <p>You wanted me to, though.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>You assume a great deal. I usually ask for what I want.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(as Marlowe does</p>
   <p>not answer)</p>
   <p>The money I paid you is of no consequence. I merely feel that you have, no doubt unintentionally, betrayed a trust.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Is that all you wanted to see me about? STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>You’re angry at that remark.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>You have an advantage over me, General. It’s an advantage I wouldn’t want to take away from you. You can say anything you like to me, and I wouldn’t think of getting angry. I’d like to offer you your money back. It may mean nothing to you. It might mean something to me.</p>
   <p>STERNWOOD What does it mean to you?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>It means I’ve refused payment for an unsatisfactory job. That’s all.</p>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>(after a pause)</p>
   <p>Why did you go to Captain Gregory?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I suppose I played a hunch. I was convinced you put those Geiger notes up to me chiefly as a test, and that you were a little afraid Regan might somehow be involved in an attempt to blackmail you. Besides, as I said — I knew Regan. It meant something to me to find out, too.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>And you allowed Captain Gregory to think I had employed you to find Shawn?</p>
   <p>Yeah, I guess I did — when I was sure he had the case.</p>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>And do you consider that ethical? MARLOWE Yes, I do.</p>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>Perhaps I don’t understand.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Maybe you don’t. When you hire a boy in my line of work it isn’t like hiring a window-washer and showing him eight windows and saying: “Wash those windows and you’re through.” You don’t know what I have to go through or over or under to do your job for you. I do it my way. I do my best to protect you, and I may have to break a few rules, but I break them in your favor — After all, you didn’t tell me NOT to go to Captain Gregory.</p>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>(with a faint smile)</p>
   <p>That would have been rather difficult.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Well, what have I done wrong? Your man Norris, seemed to think the case was over when Geiger was eliminated. I don’t see it that way. I’m not Sherlock Holmes. I don’t expect to go over ground the police have covered and pick up a broken</p>
   <p>penpoint and build a case from it. If you think there’s anybody in the detective business making a living doing that sort of thing, you don’t know much about cops. If they overlook anything, it’s something much looser and vaguer, like a man of Geiger’s type sending you his evidence of debt and asking you to pay like a gentleman. That isn’t normal. Why did he do that?</p>
   <p>Because he wanted to find out if there was anything putting pressure</p>
   <p>(MORE)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE (CONT’D)</p>
   <p>on you. If there was, you’d pay him. If not, you’d ignore him and wait. But something was putting pressure on you. Regan. You were afraid he’d stayed around and been nice to you just long enough to find out how to play games with your bank account.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(interrupting Sternwood, as he starts to speak)</p>
   <p>Even at that, it wasn’t your money</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>you cared about. It wasn’t even your daughters. You’ve more or less written them off. It’s that you’re still too proud to be played for a sucker — and you really liked Shawn Regan.</p>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(quietly, after</p>
   <p>a pause)</p>
   <p>You think entirely too much, Marlowe</p>
   <p>— Are you still trying to solve that puzzle?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>No. I’ve been warned to quit. The boys at the City Hall think I play too rough. That’s why I thought I should give you your money back — because it isn’t a completed job by my standards.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>(smiling)</p>
   <p>Quit, nothing. I’ll pay you another thousand to find Shawn Regan. He doesn’t have to come back. I don’t even have to know where he is. A man has a right to live his own life. And he must have had his reasons for running off like that. I only want to know that he’s all right. I want to know it from him directly, and if he should happen to need money, I should want him to have that also. Am I clear?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Yes, General.</p>
   <p>Sternwood leans back in the chair, his eyes closed wearily. STERNWOOD</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(trying to smile)</p>
   <p>I guess I’m a sentimental old goat, and no soldier at all. Find him for me, Marlowe. Just find him.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(rising)</p>
   <p>I’ll try. You’d better rest now. I’ve talked your arm off.</p>
   <p>He starts away. Sternwood’s voice stops him.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>(quietly)</p>
   <p>You have a lot that Shawn had. Strength — and a steady eye.</p>
   <p>Marlowe stands a moment, remembering Vivian’s words. Then he turns quietly and goes away.</p>
   <p>175. GREENHOUSE DOOR - MARLOWE</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>as he emerges, mopping again, finds Norris waiting for him, already holding Marlowe’s hat for him. Marlowe, surprised at this, is still further surprised when he looks up and sees his car, which he left in front of the house, now in the drive not far away and already turned so that it is headed back toward town.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <p>I took the liberty of turning it around for you, sir. Since you were in the greenhouse, I brought it on around here at the same time.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(ironically)</p>
   <p>So that now I won’t lose hardly any time getting back to work, huh?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <p>(impenetrable)</p>
   <p>You will always be welcome here, sir, if only to receive our gratitude.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(stuffs handkerchief into pocket, takes</p>
   <p>his hat, turns)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Thanks.</p>
   <p>He walks toward the car. But still Norris walks beside him. Marlowe already realizing that he is being practically frog-walked off the place. They reach the car. Norris steps ahead, opens the door, holds it open for Marlowe to get in.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>You don’t even need a gun, do you?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <p>I’ve never had occasion for one, sir. I don’t think I ever will.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Neither do I.</p>
   <p>(nods toward greenhouse)</p>
   <p>What do you think of him this morning?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <p>He’s stronger than he looks. As you would see for yourself if occasion arose — which, thanks to you, it will not now.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Yeah — what did Regan have that got to the General so?</p>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <p>Youth, sir. And the soldier’s eye. MARLOWE Like yours.</p>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <p>Thank you, sir. And yours. MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Thanks.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(he starts to get</p>
   <p>into the car, Norris</p>
   <p>still holding</p>
   <p>the door)</p>
   <p>So Miss Carmen went to Santa Barbara. NORRIS Yes. This morning.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(getting into car, stops) Mrs. Rutledge told me she went last</p>
   <p>night.</p>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(smoothly)</p>
   <p>It was near midnight, sir. I thought it was later. I was probably wrong.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE I see.</p>
   <p>He gets in. Norris shuts the door. Marlowe starts the engine, puts car in gear.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>If the General has any more trouble, you know how to call.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <p>And whom to call. Thank you again.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe drives on. In the mirror he can see Norris standing in the drive still watching him, guarding the house which Marlowe realizes he is not to enter again.</p>
   <p>DISSOLVE TO: 176. INT. MARLOWE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe has just entered. He kicks the door shut, crosses the living room, shedding his hat and suit coat on the floor as he passes.</p>
   <p>177. INT. MARLOWE APARTMENT - BEDROOM</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>as Marlowe continues on his way to the bath, still peeling. He vanishes into the bath — we HEAR the shower turned on. In the bedroom the PHONE RINGS. Marlowe returns, picks up the phone.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Yeah?</p>
   <p>The voice of Eddie Mars comes clearly from the instrument. MARS’ VOICE Hello, soldier.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Hello, Eddie. I been waiting to hear from you.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARS’ VOICE</p>
   <p>Got a little news for you, soldier. I’m skipping the manicures, till I finish up this job.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Yeah, I kind of thought you would. I got a T.L. for you, too, Eddie. Sternwood offered me a thousand bucks to find Shawn Regan. I took it.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARS’ VOICE</p>
   <p>(softly, after a pause)</p>
   <p>Maybe I can help you earn that grand. You remember that stuff that Joe Brody moved out of Geiger’s back room?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Yeah.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARS’ VOICE</p>
   <p>Well, I tracked it down where Joe stashed it, and moved it back up to Geiger’s place after the cops got through. You might take a look at it.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Yeah — I might.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARS’ VOICE</p>
   <p>(laughing softly)</p>
   <p>After last night I’m beginning to think you’re as tough as you look. I told you we could do business together. So long, soldier.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Be seeing you.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The receiver clicks. Marlowe sets his instrument down slowly, looks at it a moment, then returns to the shower, dropping his shirt in the doorway.</p>
   <p>DISSOLVE TO: 178. INT. MARLOWE’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>as Marlowe comes out of the bath, buttoning his pajama coat. He is freshly shaved, his hair still damp and rumpled from the shower. He pulls down the shades, putting out the daylight, and collapses into the bed.</p>
   <p>Just as he is comfortably settled, already half asleep, the doorbell RINGS. It rings insistently, with a quality of nervous urgency. Marlowe finally gets up to answer it, pulling on a dressing gown.</p>
   <p>179. INT. MARLOWE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM as Marlowe admits Vivian. She is obviously in a fine state of nerves. She enters quickly — he shuts the door. VIVIAN Phil…</p>
   <p>MARLOWE All right, now what?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>Eddie Mars just called me. He’s out to get you.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>We knew that a long time ago.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>But now you must believe it. You must get out of town — now.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>You better sit down, baby, and catch your breath.</p>
   <p>He sits down on the davenport. VIVIAN</p>
   <p>Phil, how do you feel about me?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Just like I feel about a stick of dynamite. Smooth on the outside -but it makes a mess when it goes off.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>I got a different idea last night. Or maybe you’re not a man except when two or three people are trying to murder you.</p>
   <p>They kiss — one of those kisses. Vivian frees herself.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>Now go. At once. I’ll give you money — a thousand — five thousand if you’ll get out of town now -today…</p>
   <p>That would be stage money. I like to earn my money. I can’t earn that much at one time, but what I do earn doesn’t smell bad to me.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>Would you get out of town if you knew Shawn Regan was dead?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Is Shawn Regan dead? VIVIAN Would you?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE How did he die?</p>
   <p>VIVIAN Kiss me.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Later — maybe. How did Shawn die?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>I killed him. By accident. He was teaching me to shoot and the gun went off.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>And that’s what Eddie Mars has got on you. And so he sent you here, to buy me off with you.</p>
   <p>Vivian stares at him, slaps him viciously across the face. Marlowe takes it.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Will you have the kiss now, too? She slaps him again. He takes it.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>You’re good, you’re very good, but you can’t do it, baby. It won’t wash.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>You fool, I killed him, I tell you. Just as you’re going to be dead if you don’t get out of town. Don’t you see Eddie Mars can’t let you stay alive now?</p>
   <p>Eddie never developed that trouble this morning. Now I’ll ask you one. what’s your game with me?</p>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>There’s no game — with you.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>You’ve been playing spin the bottle with me ever since I met you. It’s ‘please, Phil’ one minute, and ‘get out, Marlowe’ the next. You haven’t told me a straight truth since the first day…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>That’s a lie. I’m trying to play straight now. You fool, don’t you realize you’re going to die if you stay here?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>No. All you’ve told me is that you want me out of town at any price -and that you still believe I can be bought if you can just find the right currency. Sure I’m a fool. I try to do my job and keep my nose clean. I risk my whole future, the hatred of the cops and Eddie Mars’ gang. I dodge bullets and eat saps. But I’m not supposed to feel</p>
   <p>anything about it either way, because anybody can buy my immortal soul with a few bucks — or maybe just a kiss. Sure, I’m a fool.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>She stares at him, her eyes blazing. Suddenly she raises her hand, but before she can slap him, he speaks and she pauses.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>That’s right. Have another. I throw them in free to old clients.</p>
   <p>She stops, stares at him, suddenly takes his face between her hands, stares at him.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>You’re going to find Shawn Regan? MARLOWE Yeah.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>No matter who gets hurt? MARLOWE</p>
   <p>No matter who gets hurt. VIVIAN</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(letting her hands</p>
   <p>drop to his shoulders) All right, Phil. It’s funny — I think I really like you now, for the first time.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>She turns to the door, her head high, her voice very cool and steady. Only her eyes, hidden from Marlowe, tell how she feels.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN Goodbye, Phil.</p>
   <p>She goes out. DISSOLVE TO: 180. EXT. HOBART ARMS - AT FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>as Marlowe comes out, wearing a hat and trench-coat against the rain which has begun to fall. He gets into his car and drives off. As he does so, a second car, a dark convertible seen indistinctly in the shadowy street, swings around the corner behind him, slows, falters, then picks up speed, following Marlowe.</p>
   <p>181. EXT. LAVERNE TERRACE - NIGHT (RAIN)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>as Marlowe drives slowly, cautiously toward Geiger’s house. The street is dark, deserted. Marlowe drives without lights. He stops in the tree-shadows by the angle of Geiger’s hedge and slides quietly out of the car, keeping close to the hedge. His gum gleams faintly in his hand.</p>
   <p>182. EXT. LAVERNE TERRACE - NIGHT (RAIN)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>A section of the road over which Marlowe has just come. The dark convertible creeps along in the shadows, also without lights. It is still impossible to see who is driving.</p>
   <p>183. EXT. GEIGER’S PLACE - NIGHT (RAIN)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>as Marlowe makes his way like a stalking cat through the garden, toward the front door. Nothing stirs. There is no sound but the rain. Marlowe crosses the exposed bridge at a crouching run.</p>
   <p>Nothing happens. He pauses in the shadows by the front door, then tries the knob. Silently the door swings open. He waits, then darts swiftly inside.</p>
   <p>184. EXT. LAVERNE TERRACE - NIGHT (RAIN)</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The dark convertible, still shrouded in the heavy shadows of the trees, parks quietly behind Marlowe’s car across the road.</p>
   <p>185. INT. GEIGER’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe stands beside the door, which he has closed, listening. He is only a shadow among shadows. The house is utterly still. Marlowe, still cautious, crosses into the rear part of the house, then returns.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(laughing softly)</p>
   <p>Okay, Eddie. I get it — on the way out.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He draws the heavy curtains quickly across the windows, turns on the lights and sheds his hat and coat. The packing box from Geiger’s back room stands on the hearthrug. Marlowe bends over to look inside.</p>
   <p>186. INSERT: THE PACKING BOX</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>filled with manila filing envelopes, ledgers, <emphasis>etc.</emphasis> On the top of the stack is a folder labeled “Sternwood”. It has obviously been placed there on purpose.</p>
   <p>187. INT. GEIGER’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe picks up the folder — a KNOCK SOUNDS on the front door. Marlowe reacts, dropping the folder, and raises his gun. He moves quickly to turn out the lights, then stands beside the door, flat against the wall.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Yeah?</p>
   <p>CARMEN’S VOICE Phil — let me in.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(after a pause,</p>
   <p>unlocking the door)</p>
   <p>Come in fast and shut the door behind you.</p>
   <p>He retains his wary position while Carmen obeys. When he is sure she’s alone, he sighs, relocks the door and turns on the lights. His face is beaded with sweat, his hand shaking slightly. Carmen is lightly clad, without hat or coat. Apparently she has left home in a hurry.</p>
   <p>CARMEN Did I scare you?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(dryly)</p>
   <p>No — I was expecting visitors… I thought you were in Santa Barbara.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>They had me locked in my room. They even had my clothes locked up. But I climbed down the drain pipe. I had to see you again.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Why did you come here?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>You were just driving away when I got to your place. I followed.</p>
   <p>She is obviously wrought up, in a highly emotional state. MARLOWE</p>
   <p>It must have been important.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>It was. Phil, I — I’m sorry about the other night.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Forget it.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>I can’t. Phil, you… I don’t know quite how to say this… have you ever seen something, perhaps in a dream? Something perfect and beautiful, a long way off, and you try to reach it but there are too many things in your way?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Yeah. I know what you mean.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>Maybe if everything had been</p>
   <p>different — if I hadn’t been born a Sternwood, if my mother had lived -if I’d known a man like you before… Oh, Phil, is there ever any way back?</p>
   <p>MARLOWE That depends.</p>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>(softly, intensely serious) You could help me find the way. He looks at her, saying nothing. She comes closer to him, childlike, pleading.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>Phil, you’ve got to help me. I’m getting lost. I don’t know where I’m going any more, and I’m scared.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Why me, Carmen?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>Because… Just because you came into the house, and I saw you. Just a little thing like that. Don’t you understand, Phil? You’ve got something I need, some thing I’ve got to have. Strength, maybe. I don’t know. But I’ve got to have it, or — I don’t know what’s going to happen to me.</p>
   <p>She puts her hands on his chest, looking up into his face. For once she’s completely honest.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(quietly)</p>
   <p>Was that what you wanted from Shawn Regan?</p>
   <p>She draws away from him, very slowly, her eyes changing, hardening, becoming wary.</p>
   <p>CARMEN Perhaps… Phil…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>(gently)</p>
   <p>I’m sorry, Carmen. That’s how it goes. People have to find their own way — wherever they’re going. You can, if you really want to.</p>
   <p>He turns away, to let Carmen have that moment to herself.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(after a pause)</p>
   <p>Before you go… I have something that belongs to you.</p>
   <p>CARMEN (dully)</p>
   <p>What?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Your gun. I’ve been carrying it around, thinking I’d see you.</p>
   <p>He hands her the little gun, out of his coat pocket.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Careful of it, now. It’s cleaned and loaded in all five.</p>
   <p>CARMEN (taking the gun) Thanks.</p>
   <p>Marlowe moves past her, as though to open the door. CARMEN Turn around.</p>
   <p>He does so — she has the gun leveled, and there’s no doubt what she’s going to do with it.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Carmen!</p>
   <p>CARMEN It’s Vivian, isn’t it? MARLOWE</p>
   <p>That has nothing to do…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>It was Vivian with Shawn, too. It’s always Vivian.</p>
   <p>She fires point blank as Marlowe takes a step toward her, continues to fire, four shots in all. Then she waits until he has almost reached her and thrusts the pistol almost into his face. He catches her wrist just before she fires, pushes her hand aside as the shot goes off. She snatches her hand free, steps back, hurls the pistol at his chest. It falls to the ground. He stoops and picks it up.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>So that’s the way it was with Shawn. CARMEN</p>
   <p>(dazedly)</p>
   <p>But he died… why didn’t you? MARLOWE I blanked the shells. CARMEN</p>
   <p>(still stunned, breathless) You knew I — You knew -</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>I sort of figured it that way. And I’d like it better if Shawn had taken it in the back after all, from Eddie Mars. — He was teaching you to shoot, wasn’t he? That’s what he thought he was doing. Only you didn’t fire at the target.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>(with half-dreamy</p>
   <p>vindictiveness)</p>
   <p>No — they put him in the sump -down where the old wells are.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Couldn’t you have found a cleaner place?</p>
   <p>CARMEN He didn’t mind.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>No. I suppose oil and water are the same as wind and air when you’re dead… So Vivian paid Eddie Mars, and covered up for you.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>Yes. You’d like to do something about it, wouldn’t you? But you can’t. I’m always safe.</p>
   <p>How do you figure that?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>Because Vivian won’t let you. And you won’t do it, anyhow. You like my father, just as Shawn did. You know what would happen if you took me into court. Pictures, and long columns in the newspapers, and the Sternwood name all over the</p>
   <p>headlines. You know what that would do to father.</p>
   <p>A pause. She is looking at him like a wicked changeling.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>And Vivian’s in on this, too. Way in. You wouldn’t want to see her go to prison.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>No. I wouldn’t want that. And the old man. I wouldn’t want to kill him — for you.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>His attitude is one of defeat. Carmen is pleased, triumphant. Marlowe turns away dejectedly, picks up his hat and coat.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(not looking at her) Better take these, Carmen, it’s raining.</p>
   <p>CARMEN Thanks.</p>
   <p>She puts them on quickly, then stands looking at Marlowe.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>CARMEN</p>
   <p>I think I’m glad I didn’t kill you. This is going to eat you. You’re going to lie awake nights, thinking about it. And every so often you’ll see me somewhere, and I’ll laugh at you… Goodbye, Phil.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>She turns quickly toward door. Marlowe steps quickly to the light switch. As she opens the door and steps through it, he snaps off the light. There is a brief pause — then gun fire.</p>
   <p>188. EXT. GEIGER’S HOUSE - AT FRONT DOOR</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>as Carmen crumples silently onto the doorstep. There is silence. The door swings open. Presently from the dark shrubbery Eddie Mars comes, walking slowly toward the silent shape. His gun is in his hand. He crosses the footbridge and moves the dead head with his foot.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe snaps the switch inside the door; light floods suddenly out over Mars. Marlowe stands in the door, facing Mars across Carmen’s body as Mars reacts.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>You were a little too quick on the trigger that time, too, Eddie.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>His voice seems to break the spell. Mars goes for his gun, starts to raise it, but Marlowe fires first. Mars drops beside Carmen. As Mars falls, the SOUND of a man running away through the garden comes OVER.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Marlowe whirls, snaps a shot toward the running man, takes a few quick steps, but stops as the SOUND of a car starting and roaring frantically away comes OVER. Marlowe turns toward the door.</p>
   <p>189. INT. HOUSE - CLOSE SHOT - MARLOWE as he gathers up the Sternwood folder out of the box of blackmail stuff, puts it in his pocket as he turns. 190. INT. TELEPHONE PAY STATION - CLOSE SHOT - MARLOWE as he speaks into phone.</p>

   <p>Bernie? It’s me, Marlowe. I’ve got a couple of dead people up here at Geiger’s… Yeah… Carmen Sternwood and Eddie Mars… No, I didn’t shoot</p>
   <p>— but one of them… Yeah, I hear you. And you hear me, too. I’ll be at Sternwood’s. I can talk just as well there.</p>
   <p>He starts to put the phone down. As he does so, Ohls’ angry voice comes OVER.</p>
   <p>OHLS’ VOICE Marlowe -</p>
   <p>Marlowe puts the phone down, turns to leave the booth. 191. INT. STERNWOOD HOUSE - MARLOWE</p>
   <p>— as Norris opens the front door, admits him. Norris stares at Marlowe, divines the truth by intuition. NORRIS It — has happened?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>So you knew, too, did you? But of course you did: she would have needed somebody just to keep the nightmares off. Where is she now -Mrs. Rutledge -</p>
   <p>As he speaks, Vivian enters. She stares at him as Norris had dome, divining the truth too.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN Phil -</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>It’s all right. I was just telling Norris. It’s all all right.</p>
   <p>(Vivian sways)</p>
   <p>Catch her, Norris!</p>
   <p>Norris catches Vivian, supports her as Marlowe moves in, puts his arm around Vivian.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>We’ve got a few minutes until the police get here.</p>
   <p>NORRIS In here, sir.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>They half carry Vivian out. 192. INT. ALCOVE - VIVIAN, MARLOWE AND NORRIS IN B.G.</p>
   <p>Vivian has recovered control now.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>Poor Carmen. Even after that -that — Tell me it was quick.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>It was quick. She didn’t even know, probably. Eddie did. He had a good half second to watch his coming.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <p>(to Vivian)</p>
   <p>She was in the darkness, and Mr. Marlowe turned the light on for her — don’t you see?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>I know. Would you really have sent her to — to the -</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(quietly)</p>
   <p>Yes. You don’t kill people for free, you know.</p>
   <p>VIVIAN Yes, I know.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>So you gave Eddie Mars Shawn’s fifteen thousand dollars to put him into the sump.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>Only it was my fifteen thousand. I pawned the jewels mother left me. I still have Shawn’s money, hoping to find his relatives — if he had relatives. Not that it matters. I know what you must think of me.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Do you? — There’s one thing bothering me. It’s not the sump. Shawn wouldn’t care about that now. But he was a Catholic -</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>VIVIAN</p>
   <p>I had prayers said for him in the Cathedral. And I brought the Father out here, too. I couldn’t lie to him. He stood beside the sump and blessed Shawn. I prayed too — for me, at least.</p>
   <p>Marlowe puts his hand under her chin, tilting her head back.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>You’re okay, soldier. A little dumber than I am, but okay.</p>
   <p>(straightening up)</p>
   <p>I’m going to see your father now. VIVIAN</p>
   <p>(rising)</p>
   <p>Yes. We must tell father -</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>Not we, unless you mean Norris and me. You wait here. You may have to keep Bernie Ohls from throwing me into his basement dungeon before I open my mouth.</p>
   <p>193. INT. CONSERVATORY - STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>— watching as Marlowe and Norris approach him. He, too, seems to read something by instinct.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>Come, come, what’s happened to my daughter now? Didn’t you tell me days ago that I no longer have a heart to break?</p>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <p>It’s Miss Carmen, sir -STERNWOOD Yes? Tell me.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE She’s dead, sir.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Sternwood closes his eyes, otherwise he doesn’t move. Norris moves quickly and anxiously toward him, but he opens his eyes again, as black and fierce as ever.</p>
   <p>STERNWOOD Well? Am I to know how? Norris hesitates in dread, but Marlowe speaks smoothly.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>It was a car crash, sir. She was on her way back from Santa Barbara. It was instantaneous. I don’t think she suffered at all.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>And will no more — since it was a car crash.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>And there’s one more thing. I found Shawn Regan. He’s all right. Take my word for it.</p>
   <p>Again Sternwood’s eyes shut, then open fierce and black again.</p>
   <p>STERNWOOD But he will not return.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>No. He sends you his affection and respect, but he won’t come back.</p>
   <p>STERNWOOD Norris -</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(interrupts)</p>
   <p>We’ll forget the pay on this. I didn’t do anything. It was dropped in my lap -</p>
   <p>They all react as Vivian enters. VIVIAN Phil — they’re here. STERNWOOD The police?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>What would the police be doing here, sir?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>STERNWOOD</p>
   <p>Yes. What would the police be doing here. Go to your friends, sir. I am a little tired and will ask to be excused. Goodnight, and thank you for everything.</p>
   <p>MARLOWE Goodnight, sir.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He and Vivian walk away, Norris following. 194. INT. STERNWOOD HALL</p>
   <p>as Marlowe, Vivian and Norris come out of the conservatory. Norris draws ahead, them pauses.</p>
   <p>NORRIS</p>
   <p>(to Marlowe)</p>
   <p>May I add my own thanks, sir?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>You’re welcome, soldier. Norris inclines his head, then goes off down the hall. Marlowe and Vivian give each other one of those looks, and Marlowe takes her hand, drawing her close to him. They follow Norris.</p>
   <p>195. AT THE FRONT DOOR - GROUP SHOT - OHLS ACCOMPANIED BY POLICE</p>
   <p>As Marlowe and Vivian approach.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>OHLS</p>
   <p>All right, Marlowe. I’m waiting to see how you’re going to talk yourself out of this one.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(laughing)</p>
   <p>For once I’m going to tell the truth.</p>
   <p>OHLS</p>
   <p>It had better be good.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>MARLOWE</p>
   <p>(turning to Vivian)</p>
   <p>It’ll be good, Bernie. It’ll be very good. Because you won’t have to hold me here. I’ve decided already myself to stay.</p>
   <p>FADE OUT. THE END</p>
