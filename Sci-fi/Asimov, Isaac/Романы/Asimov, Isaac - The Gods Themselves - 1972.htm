		It had happened thirty years before, Frederick Hallam was a radiochemist, with the print on his doctoral dissertation still wet and with no sign whatever of being a world-shaker.		
	</font>

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		What began the shaking of the world was the fact that a dusty reagent bottle marked &quot;Tungsten Metal&quot; stood on his desk. It wasn&#039;t his; he had never used it. It was a legacy from some dim day when some past inhabitant of the office had wanted tungsten for some long-forgotten reason. It wasn&#039;t even really tungsten any more. It consisted of small pellets of what was now heavily layered with oxide &#151gray and dusty. No use to anyone.

<br>

	</font>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		heard the remark and who told it to Lamont a generation later. The official tale of the discovery, as reported in the books, leaves out the phraseology. One gets the impression of a keen-eyed chemist, aware of change and instantly drawing deep-seated deductions.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Not so. Hallam had no use for the tungsten; it was of no earthly value to him and any tampering with it could be of no possible importance to him. However, he hated any interference with his desk (as so many do) and he suspected others of possessing keen desires to engage in such interference out of sheer malice.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		No one at the time admitted to knowing anything about the matter. Benjamin Allan Denison, who overheard the initial remark, had an office immediately across the corridor and both doors were open. He looked up and met Hallam&#039;s accusatory eye.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		He didn&#039;t particularly like Hallam (no one particularly did) and he had slept badly the night before. He was, as it happened and as he later recalled, rather pleased to have someone on whom to vent his spleen, and Hallam made the perfect candidate.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		When Hallam held the bottle up to his face, Denison pulled back with clear distaste. &quot;Why the devil should I be interested in your tungsten?&quot; he demanded. &quot;Why should anyone? If you&#039;ll look at the bottle, you&#039;ll see that the thing hasn&#039;t been opened for twenty years; and if you hadn&#039;t put your own grubby paws on it, you would have seen no one had touched it&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Hallam flushed a slow, angry red. He said, tightly, &quot;Listen, Denison, someone has changed the contents. That&#039;s not the tungsten.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">

	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		It would have been an unfortunate remark in any case. Denison&#039;s scholastic record, as fresh as Hallam&#039;s, was far more impressive and he was the bright-young-man of the department. Hallam knew this and, what was worse, Denison knew it too, and made no secret of it Denison&#039;s &quot;How would

		know?&quot; with the clear and unmistakable emphasis on the &quot;you,&quot; was ample motivation for all that followed. Without it, Hallam would never have become the greatest and most revered scientist in history, to use the exact phrase Denison later used in his interview with Lament.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Officially, Hallam had come in on that fateful morning, noticed the dusty gray pellets gone&#151not even the dust on the inside surface remaining&#151and clear iron-gray metal in their place. Naturally, he investigated&#151		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		But place the official version to, one side. It was Denison. Had he confined himself to a simple negative, or a shrug, the chances are that Hallam would have asked others, then eventually weariest of the unexplained event, put the bottle to one side, and let subsequent tragedy, whether subtle or drastic (depending on how long the ultimate discovery was delayed), guide the future. In any event, it would not have been Hallam who rode the whirlwind to the heights.

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		And after that, nothing could prevent him from going to extremes. The analysis of the metal in the old container became his number-one priority, and his prime goal was to wipe the haughtiness from Denison&#039;s thin-nosed face and the perpetual trace of a sneer from his pale lips.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Denison never forgot that moment for it was his own remark that drove Hallam to the Nobel Price and himself to oblivion.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		He had no way of knowing (or if he knew he would not then have cared) that there was an overwhelming stubbornness in Hallam, the mediocrity&#039;s frightened need to safeguard his pride, that would carry the day at that time more than all Denison&#039;s native brilliance would have.

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;But wait awhile, Dr. Hallam. I&#039;m telling you it&#039;s not tungsten, but that doesn&#039;t mean I know what it is.&quot;

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;I mean the results are ridiculous.&quot; The technician thought a while. &quot;Impossible, actually. The charge-mass ratio is all wrong.&quot;

	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Well, then,&quot; said Hallam and, regardless of the motive that was driving him, his next remark set him on the road to the Nobel Prize and, it might even be argued, a deserved one, &quot;get the frequency of its characteristic x-radiation and figure out the charge.

		&quot;All right, Tracy. Do it over.&quot;

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;I did it over a dozen times. It&#039;s wrong.&quot;

		Tracy rubbed his ear and said, &quot;I&#039;ve got to, Doc. If I take the measurements seriously, then what you&#039;ve given me is plutonium-186.&quot;

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;The charge is +94. The mass is 186.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;But that&#039;s impossible. There&#039;s no such isotope. There can&#039;t be.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;That&#039;s what I&#039;m saying to you. But those are the measurements.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;But a situation like that leaves the nucleus over fifty neutrons short. You can&#039;t have plutonium-186. You couldn&#039;t squeeze ninety-four protons into one nucleus with only ninety-two neutrons and expect it to hang together for even a trillion-trillionth of a second.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;That&#039;s what I&#039;m telling you, Doc,&quot; said Tracy, patiently.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		And then Hallam stopped to think. It was tungsten he was missing and one of its isotopes, tungsten-186, was stable. Tungsten-186 had 74 protons and 112 neutrons in its nucleus. Could something have turned twenty neutrons into twenty protons? Surely that was impossible.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Are there any signs of radioactivity?&quot; asked Hallam, groping somehow for a road out of the maze.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;I thought of that,&quot; said the technician. &quot;It&#039;s stable. Absolutely stable.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Then it can&#039;t be plutonium-186.&quot;

		&quot;I keep telling you, Doc.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Hallam said, hopelessly, &quot;Well, give me the stuff.&quot; Alone once more, he sat and looked at the bottle in stupefaction. The most nearly stable isotope of plutonium was plutonium-240, where 146 neutrons were needed to make the 94 protons stick together with some semblance of partial stability.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		What could he do now? It was beyond him and he was. sorry he had started. After all, he had real work begging to be done, and this thing&#151this mystery&#151had nothing to do with him. Tracy had made some stupid mistake or the mass spectrometer was out of whack, or&#151 Well, what of it? Forget the whole thing! Except that Hallam couldn&#039;t do that.

	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Surely Denison would ask, &quot;Oh, and what is it, then?&quot; and nothing imaginable could have made Hallam expose himself to the kind of derision that would follow any claim that it was plutonium-186. He had to find out what it was, and he had to do it himself. Clearly, he couldn&#039;t trust anyone.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		So about two weeks later he entered Tracy&#039;s laboratory in what can fairly be described as a first-class fury.

		The matter had Hallam by the throat now. The mystery had become so exasperating as to be a personal affront Whoever had switched bottles, or switched contents, must either have switched again or have devised a metal for the specific purpose of making a fool of him.

		Peter Lament had been two years old when Hallam had picked up his altered tungsten for the first time. When he was twenty-five, he joined Pump Station One with the print on his own doctoral dissertation still fresh and accepted a simultaneous appointment on the Physics faculty of the university.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		It was a remarkably satisfactory achievement for the young man. Pump Station One was lacking in the glisten of the later stations but it was the granddaddy of them all, of the entire chain that girdled the planet now even though the entire technology was only a couple of decades old. No major technological advance had ever caught hold so rapidly and so entirely and why not? It meant free energy without limit and without problems. It was the Santa Claus and the Aladdin&#039;s lamp of the whole world.

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Lament had taken the job in order to deal with problems of the highest theoretical abstraction and yet he found himself interested in the amazing story of the development of the Electron Pump. It had never been written up in its entirety by someone who truly understood the theoretical principles (in so far as they could be understood) and who had some ability in translating the complexities for the general public. To be sure, Hallam himself had written a number of articles for the popular media, but these did not represent a connected, reasoned history &#151something Lament yearned to supply.

It had been advanced at the seminar which marked the true beginning of the Electron Pump and yet, as it turned out, it was extraordinarily difficult to get the details of that seminar and quite impossible to get the voice recordings.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Eventually, Lamont began to suspect that the dimness of the footprints left on the sands of time by that seminar was not entirely accidental. Putting several items ingeniously together, it began to seem that there was a reasonable chance that John F. X. McFarland had said something very nearly like the crucial statement Hallam had made&#151and had done so before Hallam.

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		He went to see McFarland, who was featured not at all in the official accounts, and who was now doing upper-atmosphere research, with particular reference to the Solar wind. It was not a top-echelon job, but it had its perquisites, and it had more than a little to do with Pump effects. McFarland had clearly avoided suffering the fate of oblivion that had overtaken Denison.

		McFarland took out a pipe, filled it, inspected its contents thoroughly, and said, with a queer intentness. &quot;I don&#039;t choose to remember, because it doesn&#039;t matter; it really doesn&#039;t.

		&quot;Oh, bull. The historical truth is that Hallam never let go. He drove everyone into investigating, whether they wanted to or not. Without him, that tungsten would eventually have exploded with I don&#039;t know how many casualties. There might never have been another sample, and we

	</font>
<br>

		One piece of historical truth that seemed beyond question was that it was the radioactivity that pulled &quot;Hallam&#039;s tungsten&quot; (this is what it was called as a matter of historical custom) into the big time. It didn&#039;t matter whether it was or was not tungsten; whether it had or had not been tampered with; even whether it was or was not an impossible isotope. Everything was swallowed up in the amazement of something, anything, which showed a constantly increasing intensity of radioactivity under circumstances that ruled out the existence of any type of radioactive breakdown, in any number of steps, then known.

Tracy&#039;s original determination was thus vindicated but his name was not mentioned, either then or later. With that Hallam&#039;s tungsten began to take on an epic scale and Denison began to note the changes that ended by making him a non-person.

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">

	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		A seminar to handle the problem was organized. Kantrowitsch was in the chair, which was an interesting historical note, for it was the last time in the history of the Electron Pump that a major meeting was held in connection with it that was chaired by anyone but Hallam. As a matter of fact, Kantrowitsch died five months later and the only personality with sufficient prestige to keep Hallam in the shade was removed.

		The meeting was extraordinarily fruitless until Hallam announced his Great Insight, but in the version as reconstructed by Lamont, the real turning point came during the luncheon break. At that time, McFarland, who is not credited with any remarks in the official records, although he was listed as an attendee, said &quot;You know, what we need is a little bit of fantasy here. Suppose&#151&quot;

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		He was speaking to Diderick van Klemens, and Van Klemens reported it sketchily in a kind of personal shorthand in his own notes. Long before Lamont had succeeded in tracking that down, Van Klemens was dead, and though his notes convinced Lamont himself, he had to admit they would not make a convincing story without further corroboration. What&#039;s more, there was no way of proving that Hallam had overheard the remark. Lamont would have been willing to bet a fortune that Hallam was within earshot, but that willingness was not satisfactory proof either.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		And then, suppose Lamont could prove it. It might hurt Hallam&#039;s egregious pride, but it couldn&#039;t really shake his position. It would be argued that to McFarland, the remark was only fantasy. It was Hallam who accepted it as something more. It was Hallam who was willing to stand up in front of the group and say it officially and risk the derision that might be his. McFarland would surely never have dreamed of placing himself on official record with his &quot;little bit of fantasy.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Lamont might have counter-argued that McFarland was a well-known nuclear physicist with a reputation to lose, while Hallam was a young radiochemist who could say anything he pleased in nuclear physics and, as an outsider, get away with it.

We are faced with a substance, plutonium-186, that cannot exist at all, let alone as an even momentarily stable substance, if the natural laws of the Universe have any validity at all. It follows, then, that since it does indubitably exist and did exist as a stable substance to begin with, it must have existed, at least to begin with, in a place or at a time or under circumstances where the natural laws of the Universe were other than they are. To put it bluntly, the substance we are studying did not originate in our Universe at all, but in another&#151an alternate Universe&#151a parallel Universe. Call it what you want.

		&quot;I point out that at the same time that the plutonium-186 appeared, a sample of tungsten, made up of several stable isotopes, including tungsten-186, disappeared. It may have slipped over into the parallel Universe. After all, it is logical to suppose that it is simpler for an exchange of mass to take place than for a one-way transfer to do so. In the parallel Universe, tungsten-186 may be as anomalous as plutonium-186 is here. It may begin as a stable substance and slowly become increasingly radioactive. It may serve as an energy source there just as plutonium-186 would here.&quot;

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		There is a tendency in the official account to give the impression that Hallam&#039;s suggestion caught fire at once, but it did not. Those who were willing to discuss it at all would commit themselves no farther than to say it was an amusing speculation. Kantrowitsch, in particular, did not say a word. This was crucial to Hallam&#039;s career.

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Hallam could scarcely carry through the theoretical and practical implications of his own suggestion all by himself, A team was required and it was built up. But none of the team, until it was too late, would associate himself openly with the suggestion. By the time success was unmistakable, the public had grown to think of it as Hallam&#039;s and Hallam&#039;s alone. It was Hallam, to all the world, and Hallam alone, who had first discovered the substance, who had conceived and transmitted the Great Insight; and it was therefore Hallam who was the Father of the Electron Pump.

		Thus, in various laboratories, pellets of tungsten metal were laid out temptingly. In one out of ten the transfer was made and new supplies of plutonium-186 were produced. Other elements were offered as bait and refused. . . . But wherever the plutonium-186 appeared and whoever it was that brought the supply to the central research organization working on the problem, to the public it was an additional quantity of &quot;Hallam&#039;s-tungsten.&quot;

This means that protons are more easily held together against their own electrostatic attraction and that a nucleus requires fewer neutrons to produce stability.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Plutonium-186, stable in their Universe, contains far too many protons, or too few neutrons, to be stable in ours with its less effective nuclear interaction. The plutonium-186, once in our Universe, begins to radiate positrons, releasing energy as it does so, and with each positron emitted, a proton within a nucleus is converted to a neutron. Eventually, twenty protons per nucleus have been converted to neutrons and plutonium-186 has become tungsten-186, which is stable by the laws of our own Universe. In the process, twenty positrons per nucleus have been eliminated. These meet, combine with, and annihilate twenty electrons, releasing further energy, so that for every plutonium-186 nucleus sent to us, our Universe ends up with twenty fewer electrons.

		&quot;Meanwhile, the tungsten-186 that enters the para-Universe is unstable there for the opposite reason. By the laws of the para-Universe it has too many neutrons, or too few protons. The tungsten-186 nuclei begin to emit electrons, releasing energy steadily while doing so, and with each emitted electron a neutron changes to a proton until, in the end, it is plutonium-186 again. With each tungsten-186 nucleus sent into the para-Universe, twenty more electrons are added to it.

		Hallam seemed amenable. In thirty years, his position in public esteem had become so lofty one might wonder why his nose did not bleed. Physically, he had aged impressively, if not gracefully. There was a ponderousness to his body that gave him the appearance of circumstantial weightiness and if his face were gross in its features he seemed able to give them the air of a kind of intellectual repose.

		Lament accepted this, at the time, as a straightforward statement, and, indeed, the speech may not have been as obscenely condescending as he later insisted on remembering it to have been. It was typical, though, as Lament later found out, or at least maintained, of Hallam&#039;s method of grasping the essentials of the work done by others.

Deducing the laws of nature of the para-Universe&#151the para-laws&#151is a tricky bat the fusion of small nuclei would take place more readily.&quot;

		&quot;Yes, sir. The trick was simply to work out what the details might be. The mathematics involved was somewhat subtle but once a few transformations were made, the difficulties tended to melt away. It turns out, for instance, that lithium hydride can be made to undergo catastrophic fusion at temperatures four orders of magnitude lower there than here. It takes fission-bomb temperatures to explode lithium hydride here, but a mere dyamite charge, so to speak, would turn the trick in the para-Universe. Just possibly lithium hydride in the para-Universe could be ignited with a match, but that&#039;s not very likely. We&#039;ve offered them lithium hydride, you know, since fusion power might be natural for them, but they won&#039;t touch it&quot;

		Lamont was irritated at first and then a slow anger began to build within him.

	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Bronowski therefore passed on to another language that seemed to have no relationship to any of the surrounding languages; that seemed very archaic; that seemed not even to be Indo-European&#151but which was very much alive and which was spoken in a region not so very far from where once the Etruscans had lived.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		What of the Basque language? Bronowski wondered. And he used Basque as his guide. Others had tried this before him and given up. Bronowski did not.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		It was hard work, for Basque, an extraordinarily difficult language in itself, was only the loosest of helps. Bronowski found more and more reason, as he went on, to suspect some cultural connection between the inhabitants of early northern Italy and early northern Spain. He could even make out a strong case for a broad swatch of pre-Celts filling western Europe with a language of which Etruscan and Basque were dimly-related survivors. In two thousand years, however, Basque had evolved and had become more than a little contaminated with Spanish. To try, first, to reason out its structure in Roman times and then relate it to Etruscan was an intellectual feat of surpassing difficulty and Bronowski utterly astonished the world&#039;s philologists when he triumphed.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		The Etruscan translations themselves were marvels of dullness and had no significance whatever; routine funerary inscriptions for the most part. The fact of the translation, however, was stunning and, as it turned out, it proved of the greatest importance to Lamont.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&#151Not at first. To be perfectly truthful about it, the translations had been a fact for nearly five years before Lamont had as much as heard that there were such people, once, as the Etruscans. But then Bronowski came to the university to give one of the annual Fellowship Lectures and Lament, who usually shirked the duty of attending which fell on the faculty members, did not shirk this one.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		It was not because he recognized its importance or felt any interest in it whatever. It was because he was dating a graduate student in the Department of Romance Languages and it was either that or a music festival he particularly wanted to avoid hearing. The social connection was a feeble one, scarcely satisfactory from Lament&#039;s point of view and only temporary, but it did get him to the talk.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		He rather enjoyed it, as it happened. The dim Etruscan civilization entered his consciousness for the first time as a matter of distant interest, and the problem of solving an undeciphered language struck him as fascinating. When young, he had enjoyed solving cryptograms, but had put them away with other childish things in favor of the much grander cryptograms posed by nature, so that he ended in para-theory.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Yet Bronowski&#039;s talk took him back to the youthful joys of making slow sense of what seemed a random collection of symbols, and combined it with sufficient difficulty to add great honor to the task. Bronowski was a cryptogram-mist on the grandest scale, and it was the description of the steady encroachment of reason upon the unknown that Lament enjoyed.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		All would yet have gone for nothing&#151the triple coincidence of Bronowski&#039;s appearance at campus, Lament&#039;s youthful cryptogrammic enthusiasm, the social pressure of an attractive young lady&#151were it not for the fact that it was the next day that Lamont saw Hallam and placed himself firmly and, as he eventually found, permanently, in the doghouse.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Within an hour of the conclusion of that interview, Lamont determined to see Bronowski. The issue at hand was the very one that had seemed so obvious to himself and that had so offended Hallam. Because it brought down censure on him, Lamont felt bound to strike back&#151and in connection with the point of censure specifically. The para-men

With each year, as this difference in charge grew, it would become more difficult to Pump further electrons against the force of the opposed charge-difference. It was, of course neutral atoms that were actually Pumped but the distortion of the orbital electrons in the process created an effective charge which increased immensely with the radioactive changes that followed.

		If the charge-concentration remained at the points of Pumping, the effect on the orbit-distorted atoms being Pumped would stop the entire process almost at once, but of course, there was diffusion to take into account. The charge-concentration diffused outward over the Earth, and the effect on the Pumping process had been calculated with that in mind.

		The increased positive charge of the Earth generally forced the positively charged Solar wind to avoid the planet at a greater distance, and the magnetosphere was enlarged. Thanks to the work of McFarland (the real originator of the Great Insight according to Lament) it could be shown that a definite equilibrium point was reached as the Solar wind swept away more and more of the accumulating positive particles that were repelled from Earth&#039;s surface and driven higher into the exosphere. With each increase in Pumping intensity; with each additional Pumping Station constructed, the net positive charge on Earth increased slightly, and the magnetosphere expanded by a few miles. The change, however, was minor, and the positive charge was, in the end, swept away by the Solar wind and spread through the outer reaches of the Solar system.

		The article said, in part, &quot;Because of the ever-present gravitational force, we have come to associate the phrase &#039;downhill&#039; with the kind of inevitable change we can use to produce energy of the sort we can change into useful work. It is the water running downhill that, in past centuries, turned wheels which in turn powered machinery such as pumps and generators. But what happens when all the water has run downhill?

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;There can then be no further work possible till the water has been returned uphill&#151and that takes work. In fact, it takes more work to force the water uphill than we s. It evaporates the oceans so that water vapor climbs high in the atmosphere, formams, and keeps the water forever running downhill.

		Lamont walked away from the thixo-board, with an unmistakable expression of contempt on his face. He said, . &quot;All right. The Second Law of Thermodynamics describes a process that inevitably chops off extremes. Water doesn&#039;t run downhill; what really happens is that extremes of gravitational potential are equalized. Water will just as easily bubble uphill if trapped underground. You can get work out of the juxtaposition of two different temperature levels, but the end result is that the temperature is equalized at an intermediate level; the hot body cools down and the cold body warms up. Both cooling and warming are equal aspects of the Second Law and, under, the proper circumstances, equally spontaneous.&quot; .

		Lamont said, with no change of expression, no sense of being hurried. &quot;Work is obtained out of the Electron Pump by an equalization of extremes. In this case, the extremes are the physical laws of the two Universes, The conditions that make those laws possible, whatever those conditions may be, are being bled from one Universe into the other and the end result of the entire process will be two Universes in which the laws of nature will be identical &#151and intermediate as compared with the situation now. g the Pumps and, shutting down the whole operation permanently.&quot;

		&quot;The only measured rate of mixing is within the plutonium-186 sent into this Universe. That rate of mixing is extremely slow at first, presumably because matter is dense, and increases with time. If the plutonium is mixed with less dense matter, the rate of mixing increases more rapidly. From a few measurements of this sort it has been calculated that the permeation rate would increase to the speed of light in a vacuum. It would take some time for the alien laws to work their way into the atmosphere, far less time to work their way to the top of the atmosphere and then off through space in every direction at 300,000 kilometers per second, thinning into harmlessness in no time.&quot;

		&quot;I can&#039;t put it in words. There is a mathematical expression which I think represents it, but I can&#039;t put it into words.

There are very likely trillions upon trillions of inhabited planets in the Universe, and among them there may be billions with intelligent life and highly developed technologies.

		&quot;Then it may be that in dozens or hundreds of cases, the mixture of natural law advanced locally to an extent sufficient to explode a planet&#039;s Sun. The effect might have spread outward.

Do you know what the Pump means to mankind? It&#039;s not just the free, clean, and copious energy. Look beyond that. What it means is that mankind no longer has to work for a living.

She had managed to find a special place at midday and had gorged herself in unexpected isolation and had been filled with a queer, itching sensation that demanded motion and activity. She had slithered over the rocks and had let her edges overlap theirs. It was something she knew to be a grossly improper action for anyone but a baby and yet it was something at once exciting and soothing.

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		At first, she just stared back with the confused thought that he had seen her rub through the rocks and was ashamed of her. But she caught no shame-aura and finally she said, very subdued, &quot;What is it, Daddy?&quot;

		&quot;What time?&quot; Now that it was here, Dua stubbornly would not let herself know. If she refused to know, there would be nothing to know. (She never quite got out of that habit.

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		She didn&#039;t want to tell them. They weren&#039;t close any more. It-had been different when they were all little.

They were all wispy and would tangle with each other and roll through each other and hide in the walls.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		No one ever minded that when they were little; none of the grown-ups. But then the brothers grew thick and sober and drew away. And when she complained to her Parental, he would only say gently, &quot;You are too old to thin, Dua.&quot;

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		She tried not to listen, but left-brother kept drawing away and would say, &quot;Don&#039;t snuggle; I have no time for you.&quot; And right-brother began to stay quite hard all the time and became glum and silent. She didn&#039;t understand it quite then and Daddy had not been able to make it clear. He would say every once in a while as though it were a lesson he had once learned&#151&quot;Lefts are Rationals, Dua. Rights are Parentals. They grow up their own way.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		She didn&#039;t like their way. They were no longer children and she still was, so she flocked with the other Emotionals. They all had the same complaints about their brothers. They all talked of coming triads. They all spread in the Sun and fed. They all grew more and more the same and every day the same things were said.

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		She came upon him once, talking to a Hard One. It was hard for a Parental to talk to a Hard One; even though she was quite young, she knew that much. Hard Ones talked only to Rationals.

		And Daddy just stood there. There was no way he could handle an outburst like that except to come closer and pinch out a hand. It cost him a visible effort, but he held it out trembling and its outlines were ever so slightly soft.

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Dua said, &quot;Oh, Daddy,&quot; and let her own hand flow about it so that his looked misty and shimmery through her substance; but she was careful not to touch it for that would have embarrassed him so.

		Odeen was moderately aware that Dua was off on the surface. Without really thinking about it, he could judge her direction and even something of her distance. If he had stopped to think of it, he might have felt displeasure, for this inter-awareness sense had been steadily deadening for a long time now and, without really being certain why, he had a sense of gathering fulfillment about it. It was the way things were supposed to be; the sign of the continuing development of the body with age.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Tritt&#039;s inter-awareness sense did not decrease, but it shifted more and more toward the children. That was clearly the line of useful development, but then the role of

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		the Parental was a simple one, in a manner of speaking, however important. The Rational was far more complex and Odeen took a bleak satisfaction in that thought.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Of course, it was Dua who was the real puzzle. She was so unlike all the other Emotionals. That puzzled and frustrated Tritt and reduced him to even more pronounced inarticulacy. It puzzled and frustrated Odeen at times, too, but he was also aware of Dua&#039;s infinite capacity to induce satisfaction with life and it did not seem likely that one was independent of the other. The occasional exasperation she produced was a small price to pay for the intense happiness.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		And maybe Dua&#039;s odd way of life was part of what ought to be, too. The Hard Ones seemed interested in her and ordinarily they paid attention only to Rationals. He felt pride in that; so much the better for the triad that even the Emotional was worth attention.

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Things were as they were supposed to be. That was bedrock, and it was what he wanted most to feel, right down to the end. Someday he would even know when it was time to pass on and then he would want to. The Hard Ones assured him of that, as they assured all Rationals, but they also told him that it was his own inner consciousness that would mark the time unmistakably, and not any advice from outside.

		His body lacked the strangely attractive shimmer of Dua, and the comforting stockiness of Tritt. He loved them both, but he would not change his own body for either. And, of course, his own mind. He would never say so, of course, for he would not want to hurt their feelings, but he never ceased being thankful that he did not have Tritt&#039;s limited understanding or (even more) Dua&#039;s erratic one. He supposed they didn&#039;t mind for they knew nothing else.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		He grew distantly aware of Dua again, and deliberately dulled the sense. At the moment, he felt no need for her. It was not that he wanted her less, but merely that he had increasing drives elsewhere. It was part of the growing maturity of a Rational to find more and more satisfaction in the exercise of a mind that could only be practiced alone, and with the Hard Ones.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		He grew constantly more accustomed to the Hard Ones; constantly more attached to them. He felt that was right and proper, too, for he was a Rational and in a way the Hard Ones were super-Rationals. (He had once said that to Losten, the friendliest of the Hard Ones and, it seemed to Odeen in some vague way the youngest. Losten had radiated amusement but had said nothing. And that meant he had not denied it, however.)		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Odeen&#039;s earliest memories were filled with Hard Ones. His Parental more and more concentrated his attention on the last child, the baby-Emotional. That was only natural. Tritt would do it, too, when the last child came, if it ever did. (Odeen had picked up that last qualification from Tritt, who used it constantly as a reproach to Dua.)		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		But so much the better. With his Parental busy so much of the time, Odeen could begin his education that much the earlier. He was losing his baby ways and he had learned a great deal even before he met Tritt.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		That meeting, though, was surely something he would never forget. It might as well have been yesterday as more than half a lifetime ago. He had seen Parentals of his own generation, of course; young ones who, long before they incubated the children that made true Parentals of them, showed few signs of the stolidity to come. As a child he had played with his own right-brother and was scarcely aware of any intellectual difference between them (though, looking back on those days, he recognized that it was there, even then).		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		He knew also, vaguely, the role of a Parental in a triad. Even as a child, he had whispered tales of melting.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		When Tritt first appeared, when Odeen saw him first, everything changed. For the first time in his life, Odeen felt an inner warmth and began to think that there was something he wanted that was utterly divorced from thought. Even now, he could remember the sense of embarrassment that had accompanied this.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Tritt was not embarrassed, of course. Parentals were never embarrassed about the activities of the triad, and Emotionals were almost never embarrassed. Only Rationals had that problem.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Too much thinking,&quot; a Hard One had said when Odeen had discussed the problem with him and that left Odeen dissatisfied. In what way could thinking be &quot;too much&quot;?		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Tritt was young when they first met, of course. He was still so childish as to be uncertain in his blockishness so that his reaction to the meeting was embarrassingly clear. He grew almost translucent along his edges.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Odeen said, hesitantly, &quot;I haven&#039;t seen you before, have I, right-fellow?&quot;

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		They both knew exactly what had happened to them. The meeting had been arranged because someone (some Parental, Odeen had thought at the time, but later he knew it was some Hard One) thought they would suit each other, and the thought was correct.

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Odeen, out of the excitement of finding out about the world and its Sun; about the history and mechanism of life; about all the abouts in the Universe; sometimes (in those early days together) found &#039;himself spilling over to Tritt.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Tritt listened placidly, clearly understanding nothing, but content to be listening; while Odeen, transmitting nothing, was as clearly content to be lecturing.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		It was Tritt who made the first move, driven by his special needs. Odeen was chattering about what he had learned that day after the brief midday meal. (Their thicker substance absorbed food so rapidly, they were satisfied with a simple walk in the Sun, while Emotionals basked for hours at a time, curling and thinning as though deliberately to lengthen the task.)		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Odeen, who always ignored the Emotionals, was quite happy to be talking. Tritt, who stared wordlessly at them, day after day, was now visibly restless.

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Abruptly, he came close to Odeen, formed an appendage so hastily as to clash most disagreeably on the other&#039;s form-sense. He placed in upon a portion of Odeen&#039;s upper ovoid where a slight shimmer was allowing a welcome draft of warm air as dessert. Tritt&#039;s appendage thinned with a visible effort and sank into the superfices of Odeen&#039;s skin before the latter darted away, horribly embarrassed.

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		It was bound to continue happening, and Odeen was bound to give in. He always did; it was something that was sure to happen even to the most self-conscious Rational. As the old saying had it: Everyone either admitted doing it or lied about it.

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Tritt was at him at each meeting after that; if not with an appendage, then rim to rim. And finally Odeen, seduced by the pleasure of it, began to help and tried to shine. He was better at that than Tritt was. Poor Tritt, infinitely more eager, huffed and strained, and could achieve only the barest shimmer here and there, patchily and raggedly.

		Odeen, however, could run translucent all over his surface, and fought down his embarrassment in order to let himself flow against Tritt. There was skin-deep penetration and Odeen could feel the pulsing of Tritt&#039;s hard surface under the skin. There was enjoyment, riddled with guilt.

		Let&#039;s get an Emotional! Tritt&#039;s simple drives never led him to anything but direct action. Odeen was not sure he could explain the complexities of life to the other. &quot;It&#039;s not that easy, right-ling,&quot; he began gently.

		He was sorry the instant he had said it and it was a lie anyway. He just didn&#039;t want to do anything at all that might offend the Hard Ones and impede his useful relationship with them. Tritt, however, showed no signs of minding and it occurred to Odeen that the other saw no point or merit in knowing anything he did not already know and would not consider the statement of the fact an insult.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		The problem of the Emotional kept coming up, though. Occasionally, they tried interpenetration. In fact, the impulse grew stronger with time. It was never truly satisfying though it had its pleasure and each time Tritt would demand an Emotional. Each time, Odeen threw himself deeper into his studies, almost as a defense against the problem.

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Yet at times, he was almost tempted to speak to Losten about it.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Losten was the Hard One he knew best; the one who took the greatest personal interest in him. There was a deadly sameness about the Hard Ones, because they did not change; they never changed; their form was fixed. Where there eyes were they always were, and always in the same place for all of them. Their skin was not exactly hard, but it was always opaque, never shimmered, never vague, never penetrable by another skin of its own type.

		it was, but he learned in later life that they were all of them curious about baby-Rationals. Odeen had reached up for the Hard One, out of nothing but curiosity. The Hard One had sprung backward and later Odeen&#039;s Parental had scolded him for offering to touch a Hard One.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		The scolding had been harsh enough for Odeen never to forget. When he was older he learned that the close-packed atoms of the. Hard One&#039;s tissues felt pain on the forcible penetration of others. Odeen wondered if the Soft One felt pain, too. Another young Rational once told him that he had stumbled against a Hard One and the Hard One had doubled up but that he himself had felt nothing &#151but Odeen wasn&#039;t sure this was not just a melodramatic boast.

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		There were other things he could not do. He liked rubbing against the walls of the cavern. There was a pleasant, warm feeling when he allowed himself to penetrate rock. Babies always did it, but it got harder to do as he grew older. Still, he could do it skin-deep and he liked it, but his Parental found him doing it and scolded him. He objected that his sister did it all the time; he had seen her.

		No one really told him about melting in those days. They fed him knowledge and educated him about everything except what the triad was all about. Tritt had never been told, either, but he was a Parental so he knew without being told. Of course, when Dua came at last, all was clear, even though she seemed to know less about it even than Odeen.

		Tritt said, &quot;Remember, I was the one who first got Dua.&quot; Did Odeen remember that? Did Odeen ever think of the triad and what it meant? Sometimes Tritt felt so frustrated he could&#151he could&#151 Actually, he didn&#039;t know what to do, but he knew he felt frustrated.

		Tritt knew he didn&#039;t have the trick of talking in big, elaborate sentences. But if Parentals didn&#039;t talk, they thought. They thought about important things. Odeen always talked about atoms and energy. Who cared about atoms and energy? Tritt thought about the triad and the babies.

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Odeen had once told him that the numbers of Soft Ones were gradually growing fewer. Didn&#039;t he care? Didn&#039;t the Hard Ones care? Did anyone care but the Parentals?

		Odeen had once told him the Sun was cooling off. There was less food, he said, so there were less people. Tritt didn&#039;t believe it. The Sun felt no cooler than it had when he was a baby. It was just that people weren&#039;t worrying about the triads any more. Too many absorbed Rationals; too many silly Emotionals.		
	</font>

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		What the Soft Ones must do was concentrate on the important things of life. Tritt did. He tended to the business of the triad. The baby-left came, then the baby-right.

		Eventually, they separated and stared at each other. They had melted for days. Of course, melting always took time.

		She had run off. They did not stop her. They were too overcome to stop her. But that was always the way afterward. She was always gone after a melting. No matter how successful it was, she would go. There seemed something in her that needed to be alone.

		Odeen felt differently. He would say on many occasions, &quot;Why don&#039;t you leave her alone, Tritt? She&#039;s not like the others and that means she&#039;s better than the others.

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">

		She didn&#039;t feel disloyal at the thought, either. She never expected to feel for either Odeen or Tritt the sheer intensity of longing they felt for each other. She could melt alone; they could melt only through her mediation (so why didn&#039;t that make her the more regarded). She felt intense pleasure at the three-way melting; of course she did, it would be stupid to deny it; but it was a pleasure akin to that which she felt when she passed through a rock wall, as she sometimes secretly did. To Tritt and Odeen, the pleasure was like nothing else they had ever experienced or could ever experience.

		No, wait. Odeen had the pleasure of learning, of what he called intellectual development.

		Odeen had looked embarrassed. He spent half his life being embarrassed. He said, &quot;Now, Dua, it does have to be. On account of&#151children,&quot; He seemed to pulse, as he said the word.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Well, don&#039;t pulse,&quot; said Dua, sharply. &quot;We&#039;re grown now and we&#039;ve melted I don&#039;t know how many times and we all know it&#039;s so we can have children. You might as well say so. Why does it take so long, that&#039;s all?&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Because it&#039;s a complicated process,&quot; said Odeen, still pulsing. &quot;Because it takes energy. Dua, it takes a long time to get a child started and even when we take a long time, it doesn&#039;t always get started. And it&#039;s getting worse.,.. Not just with us,&quot; he added hastily.		
	</font>

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Worse?&quot; said Tritt anxiously, but Odeen would say no more.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		They had a child eventually, a baby-Rational, a left-let, that flitted and thinned so that all three were in raptures and even Odeen would hold it and let it change shape in his hands for as long as Tritt would allow him to. For it was Tritt, of course, who had actually incubated it through the long pre-forming; Tritt who had separated from it when it assumed independent existence; and Tritt who cared for it at all times.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		After that, Tritt was often not with them and Dua was oddly pleased. Tritt&#039;s obsession annoyed her, but Odeen&#039;s &#151oddly&#151pleased her. She became increasingly aware of his&#151importance. There was something to being a Rational that made it possible to answer questions, and somehow Dua had questions for him constantly. He was readier to answer when Tritt was not present.

		She was perfectly aware that Odeen was looking at her as though he had never seen anyone as attractive and that if Tritt had been present, melting would have taken place at once. She even let herself thin out; not much, but perceptibly, in deliberate coquettishness.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Odeen said, &quot;But you might not understand the implications, Dua. It takes a great deal of energy to initiate a new spark of life.&quot;

		&quot;You&#039;ve often mentioned energy. What is it? Exactly.&quot;

		&quot;Well, then, why don&#039;t you say food.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Because food and energy aren&#039;t quite the same thing. Our food comes from the Sun and that&#039;s a kind of energy, but there are other kinds of energy that are not food. When we eat, we&#039;ve got to spread out and absorb the light. It&#039;s hardest for Emotionals because they&#039;re much more transparent; that is, the light tends to pass through instead of being absorbed&#151&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		It was wonderful to have it explained, Dua thought. What she was told, she really knew; but she didn&#039;t know the proper words;, the long science-words that Odeen knew. And it made sharper and more meaningful everything that happened.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Occasionally now, in adult life, when she no longer feared that childish teasing; when she shared in the prestige of being part of the Odeen-triad; she tried to swarm with other Emotionals and to withstand the chatter and the crowding. After all, she did occasionally feel like a more substantial meal than she usually got and it did make for better melting. There was a joy&#151sometimes she almost caught the pleasure the others got out of it&#151in slithering and maneuvering for exposure to Sunlight; in the luxurious contraction and condensation to absorb the warmth through greater thickness with greater efficiency.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Yet for Dua a little of that went quite a way and the others never seemed to have enough. There was a kind of gluttonous wiggle about them that Dua could not duplicate and that, at length, she could not endure.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		That was why Rationals and Parentals were so rarely on the surface. Their thickness made it possible for them to eat quickly and leave. Emotionals writhed in the Sun for hours, for though they ate more slowly, they actually needed more energy than the others&#151at least for melting.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		The Emotional supplied the energy, Odeen had explained (pulsing so that his signals were barely understood), the Rational the seed, the Parental the incubator.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Once Dua understood that, a certain amusement began to blend with her disapproval when she watched the other Emotionals virtually slurp up the ruddy Sunlight. Since they never asked questions, she was sure they didn&#039;t know why they did it and couldn&#039;t understand that there was an obscene side to their quivering condensations, or to the way in which they went tittering down below eventually&#151on their way to a good melt, of course, with lots of energy to spare.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		She could also stand Tritt&#039;s annoyance when she would come down without that swirling opacity that meant a good gorging. Yet why should they complain? The thinness she retained meant a defter melting. Not as sloppy and glutinous as the other triads managed, perhaps, but it was the ethereality that counted, she felt sure. And the little-left and little-right came eventually, didn&#039;t they?		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Of course, it was the baby-Emotional, the little-mid, that was the crux. That took more energy than the other two and Dua never had enough.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Even Odeen was beginning to mention it. &quot;You&#039;re not getting enough Sunlight, Dua.&quot;

		&quot;No,&quot; said Odeen, seriously. &quot;You&#039;re not like the others, and I&#039;m glad of it. And if you&#039;re interested in Rational-talk, then let me explain something. The Sun doesn&#039;t supply the food it used to in ancient times. The light-energy is less; and it takes longer exposures. The birth rate has been dropping for ages and the world&#039;s population is only a fraction of what it once was.&quot;

		&quot;Do they pass on?&quot; Dua was suddenly interested. She always thought they were immortal somehow; that they weren&#039;t born; that they didn&#039;t die. Who had ever seen a baby Hard One, for instance? They didn&#039;t have babies. They didn&#039;t melt. They didn&#039;t eat.

	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		That was why Odeen managed to be almost glad when Tritt left, for Dua was the question. The delay in initiating the third child was indeed becoming too long and Dua was growing less amenable to persuasion, not more. There was a growing restlessness in Odeen himself, that he could not quite identify, and it was something he would have to discuss with Losten.

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		(He had the keen thought-image of Tritt clumping in pursuit of the baby-Rational, who, of course, was almost as slippery, at his age, as an Emotional, and of Dua having to block the baby and bring him back, and of Tritt cluckingly undecided whether to shake the small life-object or enfold him with his substance. From the start, Tritt could thin himself more effectively for the babies than for Odeen and when Odeen rallied him about that, Tritt answered gravely, for of course he had no humor about such things, &quot;Ah,-but the children need it more.&quot;)

		Odeen was selfishly pleased with his own flow and thought it graceful and impressive. He had mentioned that once to Losten, to whom as his Hard-teacher, he confessed everything, and Losten had said, &quot;But don&#039;t you think an Emotional or a Parental feels the same about his own flow-pattern?

	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Odeen had still been quite young when the matter had come up. His relationship with the Hard Ones had only been beginning, and it suddenly struck him that he wasn&#039;t sure that there were no triads among them. That fact was common legend among the Soft Ones, but how correct was the legend? Odeen thought about that and decided one must ask and not accept matters on faith.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Odeen had said, &quot;Are you a left or a right, sir?&quot; (In later times, Odeen pulsed at the memory of that question. How incredibly naive to have asked it, and it was very little comfort that every Rational asked the question of a Hard One in some fashion, sooner or later&#151usually sooner.)		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Losten answered quite calmly, &quot;Neither, little-left. There are no lefts or rights among the Hard Ones,&quot;

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Or mid-lings?&quot; And the Hard One changed the shape of his permanent sensory region in a fashion that Odeen eventually associated with amusement or pleasure. &quot;No. No mid-lings either. Just Hard Ones of one kind.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Odeen had to ask. It came out involuntarily, quite against his desire. &quot;But how do you stand it?&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;It is different with us, little-left. We are used to it.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Could Odeen be used to such a thing? There was the Parental triad that had filled his life so far and the sure knowledge that he would at some not-too-distant time form a triad of his own. What was life without that? He thought about it hard now and then. He though about everything hard, as it came up. Sometimes he managed to catch a glimpse of what it might mean. That Hard Ones had only themselves; neither left-brother, nor right-brother, nor mid-sister, nor melting, nor children, nor Parentals. They had only the mind, only the inquiry into the Universe.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Perhaps that was enough for them. As Odeen grew older, he caught bits of understanding as to the joys of inquiry. They were almost enough&#151almost enough&#151and

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="4pt">
		 		
	</font>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">

	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Unless&#151 It was odd, but every once in a while it seemed that there might come a time, a situation, a condition, when&#151 Then he would lose the momentary glimpse, or, rather, glimpse of a glimpse, and miss it all. Yet in time it be caught.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		But none of that was what should involve him now. He had to see about Dua. He made his way along the well-known route, along which he had first been taken by his Parental (as Tritt would soon take their own young Rational, their own baby-left.)		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		And, of course, he was instantly lost in memory again.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		It had been frightening, then. There had been other young Rationals, all pulsing and shimmering and changing shape, despite the Parental signals on every side to stay firm and smooth and not disgrace the triad. One small left, a playmate of Odeen, had, in fact, flattened thin, baby-fashion, and would not unflatten, despite all the efforts of his horribly embarrassed Parental. (He had since become a perfectly normal student. . .. Though no Odeen, as Odeen himself could not help realizing with considerable complacency.)		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		They met a number of Hard Ones on that first day of school. They stopped at each, in order that the young-Rational vibration pattern might be recorded in several specialized ways and for a decision to be reached as to whether to accept them for instruction then, or to wait another interval; and if then, for what kind of instruction.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Odeen, in a desperate effort, had drawn himself smooth as a Hard One approached, and held himself unwavering.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		The Hard One said (and the first sound of the odd tones of his voice almost undid Odeen&#039;s determination to be grown-up), &quot;This is quite a firm-held Rational. How do you represent yourself, left?&quot;

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		It was the first time Odeen had ever been called &quot;left&quot; instead of in the form of some diminutive, and he felt firmer than ever as he managed to say, &quot;Odeen, Hard-sir,&quot;

	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Dimly, Odeen remembered being taken through the Hard-caverns, with their equipment, their machinery, their libraries, their meaningless, crowding sights and sounds. More than- the actual sense perceptions, he remembered his inner feeling of despair. What would they do with him? His Parental had told him that he would learn, but he didn&#039;t know what was really meant by &quot;learn&quot; and when he asked his Parental, it turned out that the older one didn&#039;t know either.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		It took him a while to find out and the experience was pleasurable, so pleasurable, and yet net without its worrisome aspects.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		The Hard One who had first called him &quot;left&quot; was his first teacher. The Hard One taught him to interpret the wave recordings so that after a while what seemed an incomprehensible code became words; words just as clear as those he could form with his own vibrations.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		But then that first one didn&#039;t appear any more and an-, other Hard One took over. It was a time before Odeen noticed. It was difficult in those early days to tell one Hard One from another, to differentiate among their voices. But then he grew certain. Little by little, he grew certain and he trembled at the change. He didn&#039;t understand its significance.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		He gathered courage and finally asked, &quot;Where is my teacher, Hard-sir?&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Gamaldan? ... He will no longer be with you, left.&quot; Odeen was speechless for a moment. Then he said, &quot;But Hard Ones don&#039;t pass on&#151&quot; He did not quite finish the phrase. It choked off.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		The new Hard One was passive, said nothing, volunteered nothing.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		It was always to be like that, Odeen found out. They never talked about themselves. On every other subject they discoursed freely. Concerning themselves&#151nothing.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		From dozens of pieces of evidence, Odeen could not help but decide that Hard Ones passed on; that they were not immortal (something so many Soft Ones took for

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="4pt">
		 		
	</font>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		granted). Yet no Hard One ever said as much. Odeen and the other student-Rationals sometimes discussed it, hesitantly, uneasily. Each brought in some small item that pointed inexorably to mortality of the Hard Ones and wondered and did not like to conclude the obvious, so they let it go.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		The Hard Ones did not seem to mind that hints of mortality existed. They did nothing to mask it. But they never mentioned it, either. And if the question was asked directly (sometimes it was, inevitably) they never answered; neither denying nor affirming.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		And if they passed on, they had to be born&#039; also, yet they said nothing of that and Odeen never saw a young Hard One.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Odeen believed the Hard Ones got their energy from rocks instead of from the Sun&#151at least that they incorporated a powdered black rock into their bodies. Some ofion for no one ever saw them feeding in any way and the Hard Ones never spoke of that either.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		In the end, Odeen took their reticence for granted&#151as part of themselves. Perhaps, he thought, it was their individuality, the fact that they formed no triads. It built a shell about them.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		And then, too, Odeen learned things of such grave import that questions concerning the private life of the Hard Ones turned to trivia in any case. He learned, for instance, that the whole world was shriveling&#151dwindling&#151		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		It was Losten, the new teacher, who told him that.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Odeen had asked about the unoccupied caverns that stretched so endlessly Into the bowels of the world and Losten had seemed pleased. &quot;Are you afraid to ask about that, Odeen?&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		(He was Odeen now; not some general reference to his left-hood. It was always a source of pride to hear a Hard One address him by personal name. Many did so. Odeen was a prodigy of understanding and the use of his name seemed a recognition of the fact. More than once Losten had expressed satisfaction at having him as a pupil.)		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Odeen was indeed afraid and, after some hesitation, said so. It was always easier to confess shortcomings to the Hard Ones than to fellow-Rationals; much easier than to confess &lt; them to Tritt, unthinkable to confess them to Tritt. . . . Those were the days before Dua.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Then why do you ask?&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Odeen hesitated again. Then he said slowly. &quot;I&#039;m afraid of the unoccupied caverns because when I was young I was told they had all sorts of monstrous things in them. But I know nothing of that directly; I only know what I have been told by other young ones who couldn&#039;t have known directly either, I want to find out the truth about them and the wanting has grown until there is more of curiosity in me than fear.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Losten looked pleased. &quot;Good! The curiosity is useful, the fear useless. Your inner development is excellent, Odeen, and remember it is only your inner development that counts in the important things. Our help to you is marginal. Since you want to know, it is easy to tell you that the unoccupied caverns are truly unoccupied. They are empty. There is nothing in them but the unimportant things left behind in times past.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Left behind by whom, Hard-sir?&quot; Odeen felt uneasily compelled to use the honorific whenever he was too obviously in the presence of knowledge he lacked that the other had.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;By those who occupied them in times past. There was a time thousands of cycles ago when there were many thousands of Hard Ones and millions of Soft Ones. There are fewer of us now than there were in the past, Odeen. Nowadays there are not quite three hundred Hard Ones and fewer than ten thousand Soft Ones.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Why?&quot; said Odeen, shocked. .(Only three_ hundred Hard Ones left. This was surely an open admission that Hard Ones passed on, but this was not the time to think of that.)

		Odeen considered that rebelliously, then said, &quot;Then other Universes. We can&#039;t give up just because the Universe does.&quot; He was palpitating as he said it. He had expanded with quite unforgivable discourtesy until he had swelled translucently into a size distinctly larger than the Hard One.

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		It had not been very long after that that Loston himself had brought them Dua. Odeen had wondered, idly, if there had been any connection, but after a while wonder burned itself out.

		&quot;Well, well. It is good of you to say so. I see you frequently in the library, and I hear from others that you do well in your advanced courses, and that makes me miss my best student. How is Tritt? Is he as Parentally stubborn in his ways as ever?&quot;

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;There are many ways of being unusual,&quot; said Odeen, thoughtfully. &quot;In some ways, Dua&#039;s odd ways displease Tritt and worry me. May I consult you?&quot;

	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;The children, of course,&quot; said Odeen. &quot;I like them and Dua likes them, too, but Tritt is the Parental. Do you understand that?&quot; (It suddenly seemed to Odeen that Losten couldn&#039;t possibly understand all the subtleties of the triad.)

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;It was as though my mind remained active in the interval,&quot; said Odeen. &quot;It was as though there was time which, even though I was unaware of its passing and unconscious of my existence, was necessary to me; during which I could think more deeply and intensely, without the distraction of the less intellectual side of life.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Yes,&quot; agreed Losten, &quot;and you&#039;d come back with a quantum-jump in understanding. It is a common thing among you Rationals, though I must admit no one improved in such great jumps as you did. I honestly think no Rational in history did so.&quot;

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;On the other hand, I may be wrong&quot;&#151and Losten seemed slightly amused at the other&#039;s sudden loss of shimmer&#151&quot;but never mind that. The point is that you, like Tritt, get something out of the melt beside the melt itself.&quot;

		&quot;It&#039;s hard to explain. We know each other in the triad; we sense each other; in some ways, all three of us are part of a single individual. A misty individual that comes and goes. Mostly it&#039;s unconscious. If we think about it with too great a concentration, we lose it, so we can never get real detail.

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Losten looked at him gravely. &quot;You only have two children so far, I think. A little-left and a little-right.&quot;

		&quot;And Dua will not trouble to absorb the necessary energy. Or even try to. She has any number of reasons but I can&#039;t believe any of them. It seems to me that for some reason she just doesn&#039;t want an Emotional. For myself&#151if Dua really didn&#039;t want one for a while&#151well, I would let her have her way. But Tritt is a Parental, and he wants one; he must have one; and somehow I can&#039;t disappoint Tritt, not even for Dua.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">

		&quot;You are a philosopher, I sometimes think, Odeen,&quot; said Losten dryly. &quot;Let&#039;s consider.

		&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said Odeen, momentarily discomfited. He had never yet seen Estwald.

Estwald was a new Hard One; new, at least, in the sense that when Odeen had been young, he had never heard him mentioned.

(What a great day! &quot;Come, Odeen, quickly! Annis is all oval and hard. All by himself, too. Dua, look!&quot; And they had rushed in. Annis was the only child then. They had had to wait so long for the second. So they rushed in and he was just plastered in the corner. He was curling at himself and flowing over his resting place like wet clay. Odeen had left because he was busy. But said, &quot;Oh, he&#039;ll do it again, Tritt&quot; They had watched for hours and he didn&#039;t.)

	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		After that they both went looking for Dua after all. For a wonder, she had finished wandering about and was just heading down again. It was a very good melting though the time lapse was only a day or so. Tritt worried about meltings then.

		After that, Odeen mentioned Estwald now and then. He always called him &quot;the New One&quot; even after considerable time had passed. He still had never seen him. &quot;1 think I avoid him,&quot; he said one time, when Dua was with them, &quot;because he knows so much about the new device. I don&#039;t want to find out too soon. It&#039;s too much fun to learn.&quot;

		&#151That was another funny thing about Dua. Tritt thought. It annoyed him. She could say the hard words almost as well as Odeen could. An Emotional shouldn&#039;t be like that.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		So Tritt made up his mind to ask Estwald because Odeen had said he was smart. Besides, Odeen had never seen him. Estwald couldn&#039;t say, &quot;I&#039;ve talked to Odeen about it, Tritt, and you mustn&#039;t worry.&quot;		
	</font>

		He was in the Hard-caverns and everything seemed different. There was nothing there that looked like anything Tritt could understand. It was all wrong and frightening.

		One day when she was quite sure her Parental wasn&#039;t in the vicinity, she let herself melt into a rock, slowly, just a little. It had been the first time she had tried it since she was quite young, and she didn&#039;t think she had ever dared go so deep.

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Perhaps (this had occurred to her over and over), by being Left-Emmish, she moved closer to Odeen and farther from Tritt, and this was another reason Tritt&#039;s importunities repelled her. Odeen had never hinted at anything like that, but perhaps Tritt felt it vaguely and was unable to grasp it completely but did so well enough to be unhappy over it without being able to explain why.

		The first time she was in a Hard-cavern she had heard two Hard Ones talking together. She didn&#039;t know they were talking of course. There was air vibration, very rapid, very changing, that made an unpleasant buzz deep inside her. She had to rarefy and let it through.

		She had even come down alone once or twice. It had always frightened her a little to do so, though the Hard Ones she met were always friendly, always &quot;very kind,&quot; as Odeen said. But they did not seem to take her seriously. They were pleased, but somehow amused&#151she could feel that definitely&#151when she asked questions.

		She wondered if she had met Estwald. She never quite dared ask the names of the Hard Ones she met (except Losten, to whom Odeen had introduced her, and of whom she heard a great deal).

Tritt had heard him say that and had asked of what use it was for stars to exist if they couldn&#039;t be seen and he didn&#039;t believe a word of it. Odeen had said, &quot;Now, Tritt,&quot; in a patient way. Dua had been about to say something very like that which Tritt had said, but changed her mind after that.)

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		It had only been a few days ago when she had said to Odeen, &quot;Do you remember, long ago, when you took me to the Hard-caverns and I sensed the Hard Ones and said I caught the feeling of a big sun?&quot;

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">

		And then the feeling of cold horror left her and was replaced by astonishment. Tritt was not thinking of her at all. He had to be unaware of her presence.

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Dua might have penetrated farther and found out something, at least, about what it was he had done, and why, but nothing was further from her thoughts. Since Tritt didn&#039;t know she was in the vicinity, she wanted to make sure of only one thing&#151that he continued not to know.

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Perhaps it was (she later thought) because of her idle reminiscences of that little-girl talk with Doral, or her memories of her own experiments with rock-rubbing.

	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		In any case, without quite knowing what she was doing or, for a short while afterward, what she had done, she simply flowed hastily into the nearest wall.

		he was sensitive. Odeen had frequently remarked how well he understood something after a period of melting, even though he had not understood it at all before. There was something about the melted state that increased sensitivity incredibly; more was absorbed; more was used. It was because of the greater atomic density during melting, Odeen had said.

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Even though Dua was&#039; not sure what &quot;greater atomic density&quot; meant, it came with melting and wasn&#039;t this present situation rather like melting? Hadn&#039;t Dua melted with rock?

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		When the triad melted, all the sensitivity went to Odeen&#039;s benefit. The Rational absorbed it, gained understanding, and retained that understanding after separation. But now Dua was the only consciousness in the melt. It was herself and the rock. There was &quot;greater atomic density&quot; (surely?) with only herself to benefit.

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">

	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		And then Dua stopped all speculation and just sensed&#151in fascination. She was &quot;only mechanically aware of Tritt returning, moving past her, passing in the direction back from which he had come. She was only mechanically aware&#151scarcely feeling the vaguest surprise&#151that Odeen, too, was coming up from the Hard-caverns.

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		In this he surprised himself. He could not deny to himself that it was Tritt who, of the two, was the dearer to him. Ideally, all members of the triad were one, and any member should treat the other two exactly on a par&#151both with each otheree was always a little left out, and generally knew it, too.

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		It was rarely the Emotional, though. They supported each other cross-triad to an extent that Rationals and Parentals never did. The Rational had his teacher, the proverb went, and the Parental his children&#151but the Emotional had all the other Emotionals.

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Emotionals compared notes and if one claimed neglect, or could be made to claim it, she was sent back with a thin patter of instructions to stand firm, to demand! And because melting depended so much on the Emotional and her attitude, she was usually pampered by both left and right.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		But Dua was so non-Emotional ,an Emotional! She didn&#039;t seem to care that Odeen and Tritt were so close, and she had no close friendships among the Emotionals to make her care. Of course that was it; she was so non-Emotional an Emotional.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Odeen loved having her so interested in his work; loved having her so concerned and so amazingly ready of comprehension; but that was an intellectual love, lie deeper feeling went to steady, stupid Tritt, who knew his place so well and who could offer so little other than exactly what counted&#151the security of assured routine.

		&#039;&#039;The children are well-trained. They know enough to place themselves in community-care. Really, Odeen, they are not babies.&quot; But he did not deny the &quot;been-gone&quot; aura that he faintly exuded.

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;You should feel so more often,&quot; Tritt said. &quot;You always tell me to leave her alone. You look for her.&quot; And he went on into the deeper recesses of the home cavern.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Odeen looked after his right-ling with some surprise. At almost any other occasion he would have followed in an attempt to probe the unusual uneasiness that was making itself quite evident through the ingrained stolidity of a Parental. What had Tritt done?		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&#151But he was waiting for Dua, and growing more anxious by the moment, and he let Tritt go.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Anxiety keened Odeen&#039;s sensitivity. There was almost a perverse pride among Rationals in their relative poverty of perception. Such perception wasn&#039;t a thing of the mind; it was most characteristic of Emotionals. Odeen was a Rational of Rationals, proud of reasoning rather than feeling, yet now he flung out the imperfect net of his emotional perception as far as he could; and wished, for just a moment, that he were an Emotional so that he could send it out farther and better.

		Yet it eventually served his purpose. He could detect Dua&#039;s approach, finally, at an unusual distance&#151for him &#151and he hastened out to meet her.

		He repressed the question. Dua was coming from the direction of the Hard-caverns. Perhaps Losten had been talking to her, suspecting that despite everything Odeen would be too proud of his status to help his mid-ling.

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Neither Odeen nor Dua had any thought of melting, but there was no thought in either mind of disobeying the command. The Parental&#039;s home was his castle. The Rational had his Hard-caverns below and the Emotional her meeting places above. The Parental had only his home.

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Yes, Tritt,&quot; Odeen had said, &quot;but she doesn&#039;t behave as she should, so why not accommodate her? Is it so terrible? She will eat privately, gain substance, make us happier, become happier herself, and maybe learn to swarm in the end.&quot;

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">

Stars of the other Universe that were no bigger than our Sun would be cold and dead. On the other hand, if stars in our Universe were bigger than they are, the amount of fusion would be so great it would blow them up. That means that in our Universe there must be thousands of times as many small stars as there are larger stars in theirs&#151&quot;

		&quot;Well,&quot; said Odeen. &quot;We transfer matter back and forth to make the Positron Pump and that means the Universes mix together a little.

		&quot;I don&#039;t know. If they do, they haven&#039;t told me so. Losten once told me it didn&#039;t matter what they were like, as long as the Positron Pump worked and was enlarged.&quot;

During the time of unconsciousness in melting we are a Hard One. But it is only temporary, and we can never remember the period afterward. We can never stay a Hard One long; we must come back. But all through our life we keep developing, with certain key stages marking it off. Each baby born marks a key stage.

Listen to me, Dua; melting is a putting together of the minds, too, and that&#039;s much harder, much more delicate. To put it together properly and permanently, just so, the Rational must reach a certain pitch in development. That pitch is reached when he finds out,

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;I&#039;m not really angry but you must be reasonable. You Earthmen have been adapted to Earth-gravity for all the three hundred million years since life crawled onto dry land. Even if you don&#039;t exercise, you get by. We&#039;ve had no time at all to adapt to Moon-gravity.&quot;

		&quot;Not in itself. You can climb down as though it were a ladder. However, there are always youngsters swinging down at considerable speed and Earthies don&#039;t know how to keep out of the way.

		The Earthman looked down. It was a large cylindrical opening with pink smooth walls to which metal bars were attached in what seemed a random configuration.

		No one seemed to be paying particular attention either to the playground or to the Earthman. Some had looked at him indifferently as he passed, seeming to weigh his clothed state, his facial appearance, and then had turned away. Some made a casual hand gesture to Selene&#039;s direction before turning away, but all turned away. The no-interest signal, however subdued, could not have been more blatant.

		The Earthman turned to the cylindrical opening. There were slim figures at the bottom, foreshortened because they were seen from above. Some wore wisps of clothing in red, some in blue. Two teams, he decided. Clearly the wisps served protective functions, since all wore gloves and sandals, protective bands about knees and elbows. Some wore brief bands about the hips, some about the chests.

		On either side of the cylinder now, two individuals were rising rapidly and the patter of light drumbeats was heard in the background.

		Each pair went up in unison; each pair rose and fell in a more complicated pattern.

That evoked louder applause.

		&quot;You are cynical. But justly so. In return I want your help. The retiring Commissioner, Mr. Montez, is not certain as to the lines of scientific research being undertaken on the Moon. Communications between the peoples of Earth and Moon are not perfect, and coordination of the efforts on both worlds is clearly for the benefit of all. It is understandable that there&#039;s distrust, I suppose, but if you can do anything to break down that distrust, it will be as valuable to us as your scientific findings might be.&quot;

		&quot;Peter Lamont. He has some interesting thoughts on para-theory.

		&quot;Well, when I asked permission to go along on the routine servicing of the Solar batteries, he was perfectly willing to have me go, but he wouldn&#039;t go himself.

Look, Selene&#151 What I mean is that Neville is so intent on developing a Pump Station on the Moon when the Solar batteries are so adequate for the job. We couldn&#039;t use Solanever as unfailing, as prolonged, as bright, as radiant in all wave lengths. There&#039;s not a single planetary body in the Solar system, no body of any size, theries than the Moon is.

		He struggled to his feet and said, &quot;A Pump Station, however, would mean that no Lunarite would ever have to come out on the surface, if he didn&#039;t want to.&quot;		
	</font>

		&quot;That&#039;s too smooth for a beginner to work up,&quot; Selene said, answering his thoughts. &quot;Don&#039;t get too ambitious or you&#146ll want me to teach you the kangaroo-hop next.&quot;

		&quot;Of course. The gravity is weaker on the Moon than on the Earth, so you press against the ground much less strongly, and that means there is much less friction.

	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Besides, we&#039;re going to use gliders, of course.&quot; She had a small cartridge in her hand. Clamps and a pair of thin tubes were attached to it.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;What is that?&quot; asked Ben.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Just a small liquid-gas reservoir. It will emit a jet of vapor just under your boots. The thin gas layer between boots and ground will reduce friction to virtually zero. You&#039;ll move as though you were in clear space.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">

	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Oh, now. What gas do you think we use in these gliders? Carbon dioxide? Oxygen? This is waste gas to begin with. It&#039;s argon. It comes out of the Moon&#039;s soil in ton-lots, formed by the billions of years of breakdown of po-tassium-40. . . . That&#039;s part of my lecture, too, Ben. . . . The argon has only a few specialized uses on the Moon. We could use it for gliding for a million years without exhausting the supply. ... All right. Your gliders are on, Now wait till I put mine on.&quot;

		&quot;How do they work?&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;It&#039;s quite automatic. You just start sliding and that will trip the contact and start the vapor. You&#039;ve only got a few minutes supply; but that&#039;s all you&#039;ll need.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		She stood up and helped him to his feet. &quot;Face downhill. ... Come on, Ben, this is a gentle slope. Look at it. It looks perfectly level.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;No, it doesn&#039;t,&quot; said Denison, sulkily. &quot;It looks like a cliff to me.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Nonsense. Now listen to me and remember what I told you. Keep your feet about six inches apart and one just a few inches ahead of the other. It doesn&#039;t matter which one is ahead. Keep your knees bent. Don&#039;t lean into the wind because there isn&#039;t any. Don&#039;t try to look up or back, but you can look from side to side if you have to. Most of all, when you finally hit level, don&#039;t try to stop too soon; you&#039;ll be going faster than you think. Just let the glider expire and then friction will bring you to a slow halt.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;I&#039;ll never remember all that.&quot;		
	</font>

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Yes, you will. And I&#039;ll be right at your side to help. And if you do fall and I don&#039;t catch you, don&#039;t try to do anything. Just relax and let yourself tumble or slide. There are no boulders anywhere that you can collide with.&quot;

		Denison swallowed and looked ahead. The southward slide was gleaming in Earthlight. Minute unevenness caught more than their share of light, leaving tiny uphill patches in darkness so that there was a vague mottling of the surface. The bulging half-circle of Earth rode the black sky almost directly ahead.

	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Then off you go,&quot; she said. She pushed and Denison felt himself begin to move. He moved quite slowly at first. He turned toward her, wobbling, and she said, &quot;Don&#039;t worry. I&#039;m right at your side.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		He could feel the ground beneath his feet&#151and then he couldn&#039;t. The glider had been activated.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		For a moment he felt as though he were standing still. There was no push of air against his body, no feel of anything sliding past his feet. But when he turned toward Selene again, he noticed that the lights and shadows to one side were moving backward at a slowly increasing speed.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Keep your eyes on the Earth,&quot; Selene&#039;s voice said in his ear, &quot;till you build up speed. The faster you go, the more stable you&#039;ll be. Keep your knees bent . . . You&#039;re doing very well, Ben.&quot;

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Like flying,&quot; he said. The pattern of light and dark on either side was moving backward in a blur. He looked briefly to one side, then the other, trying to convert the sensation of a backward flight of the surroundings into one of a forward flight of his own. Then, as soon as he succeeded, he found he had to look forward hastily at the Earth to regain his sense of balance. &quot;I suppose that&#039;s not a good comparison to use to you. You have no experience of flying on the Moon.&quot;

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Denison was going fast enough now so that he got the sensation of motion even when he looked ahead. The Moonscape ahead was opening before him and flowing past on either side. He said, &quot;How fast do you get to go in a glide?&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;A good Moon-race,&quot; said Selene, &quot;has been clocked at speeds in excess of a hundred miles an hour&#151on steeper slopes than this one, of course. You&#039;ll probably reach a top of thirty-five.&quot;

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Well, it isn&#039;t. We&#039;re leveling off now, Ben, and you haven&#039;t fallen. Now just hang on; the glider will die off and you&#039;ll feel friction. Don&#039;t do anything to help it. Just keep going.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Selene had barely completed her remarks when Denison felt the beginning of pressure under his boots. There was at once an overwhelming sensation of speed and he clenched his fists hard to keep from throwing his arms up in an almost reflex gesture against the collision that wasn&#039;t going to happen. He knew that if he threw up his arms, he would go over backward.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		He narrowed his eyes, held his breath till he thought his lungs would explode, and then Selene said, &quot;Perfect, Ben, perfect. I&#039;ve never known an Immie to go through his first slide without a fall, so if you do fall, there&#039;ll be nothing wrong. No disgrace.&quot;		
	</font>

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;I don&#039;t intend to fall,&quot; whispered Denison. He caught a large, ragged breath, and opened his eyes wide. The Earth was as serene as ever, as uncaring. He was moving more slowly now&#151more slowly&#151more slowly&#151		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">

Lamont, a physicist back on Earth, tried in his way to alert the world to the dangers of the Pump. He failed.

		&quot;All they have to do is refuse to believe it means death. The easiest way to solve a problem is to deny it exists. Your friend, Dr. Neville, does the same thing.

		&quot;Ah. But that&#039;s my point. At the height of the push for genetic engineering, there was this attempt to stimulate Intuitionism. Almost all the great scientists had intuitive ability, of course, and there was the feeling that this was the single great key to creativity. One could argue that superior capacity for intuition was the product of a particular gene combination and there were all sorts of speculations as to which gene combination that was.&quot;

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;And I suspect that if you are consulting your intuition here, you are correct But there were also those who insisted that one gene, or one small related group of genes, was of particular importance to the combination so that you might speak of an Intuition Gene. . . , Then the whole thing collapsed.&quot;

		&quot;But before it collapsed,&quot; Denison went on, &quot;there had been attempts to alter genes to increase the intensity of Intuitionism and there were those who insisted that some success had been achieved.

		&quot;Perhaps not. The whole field grew fearfully unpopular with the general public and anyone who can be considered the product of genetic engineering would not exactly be greeted gladly. . . .

		&quot;That would take awhile to explain. You know that the reason we can&#039;t set up a Pump Station anywhere we want to is that we can&#039;t locate the para-Universe, even though they can locate us. That might be because they are much more intelligent or much more technologically advanced than we are&#151&quot;

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="4pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;I know. That&#039;s why I put in the &#039;or.&#039; But it might also be that we are neither particularly stupid nor particularly backward. It might be something as simple as the fact that they offer the harder target. If the strong nuclear interaction is stronger in the para-Universe, they&#039;d be bound to have much smaller Suns and, very likely, much smaller planets. Their individual world would be harder to locate than ours would be.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="4pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Or then again,&quot; she went on, &quot;suppose it&#039;s the electromagnetic field they detect. The electromagnetic field of a planet is much larger than the planet itself and is much easier to locate. And that would mean that while they can detect the Earth, they can&#039;t detect the Moon, which has no electromagnetic field to speak of. That&#039;s why, perhaps, we&#039;ve failed to set up a Pump Station on the Moon. And, if their small planets lack a significant electromagnetic field, we can&#039;t locate them.&quot;

	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Next, consider the inter-Universal exchange in properties that serves to weaken their strong nuclear interaction, cooling their Suns, while strengthening ours, heating and exploding our Suns. What might that imply? Suppose they can collect energy one-way without our help but only at ruinously low efficiencies. Under ordinary circumstances that would therefore be utterly impractical. They would need us to help direct concentrated energy in their direction by supplying tungsten-186 to them and accepting plutonium-186 in return. But suppose our Galactic arm implodes into a quasar. That would produce an energy concentration in the neighborhood of the Solar system enormously greater than now exists and one that might persist for over a million years.		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Once that quasar forms, even a ruinously low efficiency becomes sufficient. It wouldn&#039;t matter to them, therefore, whether we are destroyed or not. In fact, we might argue that it would be safer for them if we did explode. Until we do, we might end the Pump for any of a variety of reasons and they would be helpless to start it again. After the explosion, they are home free; no one could interfere. . . . And that&#039;s why people who say, &#039;If the Pump is dangerous, why don&#039;t those terribly clever para-men stop it?&#039; don&#039;t know what they&#039;re talking about&quot;

	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Denison took a deep breath. &quot;You can&#039;t possibly know this, Selene, but there was a rumor on Earth that Lament received a message from the para-men to the effect that the Pump was dangerous, but that they couldn&#039;t stop it. No one took it seriously, of course, but suppose it&#039;s true. Suppose Lamont did receive such a message. Might it be that some of the para-men were humanitarian enough to wish not-to destroy a world with cooperating intelligences upon it, and were prevented by the opposition of an oh-so-practicai majority?&quot;

He says that though the human body was adapted to Earth&#039;s surface and requires adjustment to the Moon, the human brain was not and does not. The human brain is so different, qualitatively, from all other brains that it can be considered a new phenomenon. It has had no time to be really fixed to Earth&#039;s surface and can, without adjustment, fit other environments.

		&quot;I&#039;m sure he wouldn&#039;t,&quot; said Denison. He looked at the Earth-crescent, watching the distant cloud banks on edge. He fell into silence, absorbed in the view, and even though Selene moved back to the Pionizer, he remained in place. &#039; He watched Earth in its nest of stars and looked toward the serrated horizon where, every once in a while, it seemed to him he saw a puff of smoke where a small meteorite might be landing.

		And as Denison watched the sky and thought of that, he saw what, in the midst of his momentary preoccupation, he took to be a meteorite. Light streaking through the sky could, however, be a meteorite only on Earth with its atmosphere and not on the airless Moon.

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">

		&quot;Not quite at random, Commissioner,&quot; said Denison. &quot;The probability of leakage drops with distance from the Pionizer, and rather sharply I should say. The sharpness depends on a variety of factors and I think we&#039;ve tightened the situation remarkably. Even so, a flip of a few hundred yards is quite probable and, as a matter of fact, you saw it happen.&quot;

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Denison said, impatiently, &quot;No, no. The leak, at least by the techniques we use, is heavily dependent on the density of matter already present in this Universe. The chances are virtually nil that the leak-position would shift from a place of essential vacuum to one where an atmosphere even a hundredth as dense as that within the city or within our helmets would exist. It would be impractical to expect to arrange the leak anywhere but into a vacuum in the first place, which is why we had to make the attempt up here on the surface.&quot;

	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;I can try,&quot; said Denison, cautiously. &quot;Suppose we start with the para-Universe. It has a more intense strong nuclear interaction than our Universe has so that relatively small masses of protons in the para-Universe can undergo the fusion reaction capable of supporting a star. Masses equivalent to our stars would explode violently in the para-Universe which has many more, but much smaller, stars than ours does.

In fact, if the strong nuclear interaction were made sufficiently weak, a Universe would exist which consisted of a single star containing all the mass in that Universe. It would be a very dense star, but relatively non-reactive and giving off no more radiation than our single Sun does, perhaps.&quot;

		&quot;Yes,&quot; said Denison, &quot;as a matter of fact, the anti-para-Universe I am picturing consists of what some call a cosmic egg; or &#039;cosmeg&#039; for short. A cosmeg-Universe is what we need if we are to probe for one-way leakage. The para-Universe we are now using with its tiny stars is virtually empty space.

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Denison hesitated. &quot;That is the part I find difficult to explain. Pions are the mediating particles of the strong nuclear interaction. The intensity of the interaction depends on the mass of the pions and that mass can, under certain specialized conditions, be altered. The Lunar physicists have developed an instrument they call the Pionizer, which can be made to do just such a thing. Once the pion&#039;s mass is decreased, or increased for that matter, it is, effectively, part of another Universe; it becomes a gateway, a crossing point. If it is decreased sufficiently, it can be made part of a cosmeg-Universe and that&#039;s what we want.&quot;

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Gottstein said, &quot;And you can suck in matter from the&#151 the&#151cosmeg-Universe?&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;That part is easy. Once the gateway forms, the influx is spontaneous. The matter enters with its own laws and is stable when it arrives. Gradually the laws .of our own Universe soak in, the strong interaction grows stronger, and the matter fuses and begins to give off enormous energy.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;But if it is super-dense, why doesn&#039;t it just expand in a puff of smoke?&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;That, too, would yield energy, but that depends on the electromagnetic field and in this particular case the strong interaction takes precedence, because we control the electromagnetic field. It would take quite a time to explain that.&quot;

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Certainly. And in any quantity. What you saw was the arrival in our Universe of micromicrogram masses of cosmeg. There&#039;s nothing, in theory, to prevent our bringing it over in ton-lots.&quot;

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		Denison shook his head. &quot;No. The use of cosmeg energy also alters the properties of the Universes in question. The strong interaction gradually grows more intense in the cosmeg-Universe and less intense in ours as the laws of nature cross over. That means that the cosmeg slowly undergoes fusion at a greater rate and gradually warms up. Eventually&#151&quot;

		&quot;I&#039;m not sure, but surely that is not an immediate worry. The leakage of our strong-interaction field into the cosmeg-Universe must very likely continue for millions of years before pushing it past the critical point. And there must be other cosmeg-Universes; an infinite number, perhaps.

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;That would not be necessary, Commissioner,&quot; said Denison, earnestly. &quot;While the strong interaction here in our Universe weakens as a result of the cosmeg pump, it strengthens through the action of the ordinary Electron Pump. If we adjust the energy productions of the two then, though the laws of nature change in the cosmeg-Universe and in the para-Universe, they do not change in ours. We are a highway but not the terminus in either direction.

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;Nor need we be disturbed on behalf of the terminuses&#039;. The para-men on their side may have adjusted themselves to the cooling off of their Sun which may be pretty cool to begin with. As for the cosmeg-Universe, there is no reason to suspect life can exist there. Indeed, it is by inducing the conditions required for the big bang that we may be setting up a new land of Universe that will eventually grow hospitable to life.&quot;

		&quot;Then I will proceed without preliminaries. I have returned from Earth, Dr. Neville, and it is quite settled as to what will be the course of future procedure. Large cosmeg pump stations will be set up on three different places on the Lunar surface in such a way that one will always be in the night-shadow. Half the time, two win be. Those in the night-shadow will be constantly generating energy, most of which will simply radiate into space. The purpose will be not so much to use the energy for practical purposes, as to counteract the changes in field intensities introduced by the Electron Pump.&quot;

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;I dare say it will, more or less, but we have other things in mind. You might as well know now. Energy is not the only conserved phenomenon that becomes limitless once universes are crossed.&quot;

	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;I&#039;m glad you do,&quot; said Neville, turning a hostile glare in his direction. &quot;They include those of linear momentum and angular momentum. As long as any object responds to the gravitational field in which it is immersed, and to that only, it is in free fall and can retain its mass. In order to move in any other way than free fall, it must accelerate in a non-gravitational way and for that to happen, part of itself must undergo an opposite change.&quot;		
	</font>
<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">

		&quot;I&#039;m sure you understand, Dr. Denison,&quot; said Neville, &quot;but I explain for the Commissioner&#039;s sake. The loss of mass can be minimized if its velocity is increased enormously, since momentum is equal to mass multiplied by velocity. Nevertheless, however great the velocity, some mass must be thrown away. If the mass which must be ac

		&quot;Yes, the Moon,&quot; said Neville, calmly. &quot;If the Moon were to be driven out of its orbit and sent out of the Solar system, the conservation of momentum would make it a colossal undertaking, and probably a thoroughly impractical one. If, however, momentum could be transferred to the cosmeg in another Universe, the Moon could accelerate at any convenient rate without loss of mass at all. It would be like poling a barge upstream, to give you a picture I obtained from some Earth-book I once read.&quot;

		&quot;I should think that would be obvious. Why do we need the suffocating presence of the Earth? We have the energy we need; we have a comfortable world through which we have room to expand for the next few centuries, at least Why not go our own way? In any case, we will. I have come to tell you that you cannot stop us and to urge you to make no attempt to interfere. We shall transfer momentum and we shall pull out. We of the Moon know precisely how to go about building cosmeg pump stations. We will use what energy we need for ourselves and produce excess in order to neutralize the changes your own power stations are producing.&quot;

		Denison said, sardonically, &quot;It sounds kind of you to produce excess for our sake, but it isn&#039;t for our sake, of course. If our Electron Pumps explode the Sun, that will happen long before you can move out of even the inner Solar system and you will vaporize wherever you are.&quot;

		&quot;You won&#039;t leave, because there&#039;s no sense to doing so. Why drag the entire Moon away? To build up respectable accelerations will take years where the Moon-mass is concerned. You&#039;ll creep. Build starships instead; miles-long ships that are cosmeg-powered and have independent ecologies. With a cosmeg momentum-drive, you can then do wonders. If it takes twenty years to build the ships, they will nevertheless accelerate at a rate that will enable them to overtake the Moon&#039;s place within a year even if the Moon starts accelerating today. The ships will be able to change course in a tiny fraction of the time the Moon will.&quot;

<br>
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3pt" color="#000000">
		&quot;The energy required by a ship, or even by a number, will be far less than that required by a planet and will be distributed throughout large sections of the Universe. It will be millions of years before any significant change takes place. That is well worth the maneuverability you gain. The Moon will move so slowly it might as well be left in space.&quot;

They don&#039;t like it particularly, but they do. The interior of the Moon isn&#039;t their womb, as it is in your case. It isn&#039;t their prison, as it is yours. There is a neurotic factor in you that is absent in most Lunarities, or at least considerably weaker. If you take the Moon away from Earth, you make it into a prison for all.
