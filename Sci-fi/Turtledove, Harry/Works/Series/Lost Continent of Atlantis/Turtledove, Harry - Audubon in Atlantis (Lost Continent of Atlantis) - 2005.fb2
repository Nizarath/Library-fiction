  <section>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Delicate as if walking on eggs, the riverboat <emphasis>Augustus Caesar</emphasis> eased in alongside the quay at New Orleans. Colored roustabouts, bare to the waist, caught lines from the boat and made her fast. The steam whistle blew several long, happy blasts, telling the world the stemwheeler had arrived. Then black smoke stopped belching from the stacks as the crew shut down the engines.</p>
   <p>The deck stopped quivering beneath John Audubon's feet. He breathed a silent sigh of relief; for all the time he'd spent aboard boats and ships, he was not a good sailor, and knew he never would be. Any motion, no matter how slight, could make his stomach betray him. He sighed —a long sea voyage still lay ahead of him.</p>
   <p>Edward Harris came up and stood alongside him. "Well, my friend, we're on our way," he said.</p>
   <p>"It's true—we are. And we shall do that which has not been done, while it may yet be done." As Audubon always did, he gathered enthusiasm when he thought about the goal and not the means by which he had to accomplish it. His English was fluent, but heavily flavored by the French that was his birth-speech. He was a good-sized man—about five feet ten—with shoulder-length gray hair combed straight back from his forehead and with bushy gray side whiskers that framed a long, strong-nosed face. Even without an accent, he would have spoken more mushily than he liked; he was nearer sixty than fifty, and had only a few teeth left. "Before long, Ed, either the great honkers will be gone from this world or I will."</p>
   <p>He waited impatiently till the gangplank thudded into place, then hurried off the <emphasis>Augustus Caesar</emphasis> onto dry land, or something as close to dry land as New Orleans offered.</p>
   <p>Men and women of every color, wearing everything from rags to frock coats and great hoop skirts, thronged the muddy, puddled street. Chatter, jokes, and curses crackled in Spanish, French and English, and in every possible mixture and corruption of those tongues. Audubon heard far more English than he had when he first came to New Orleans half a lifetime earlier. It was a French town then, with the Spanish dons hanging on where and as they could. Times changed, though. He knew that too well.</p>
   <p>Not far from the Cabildo stood the brick building that housed the Bartlett Line. Edward Harris following in his wake, Audubon went inside. A clerk nodded to them. "Good day, gentlemen," he said in English. A generation earlier, the greeting would surely have come in French. "How may I be of service to you today?"</p>
   <p>"I wish to purchase passage to Atlantis for the two of us," Audubon replied.</p>
   <p>"Certainly, sir." The clerk didn't bat an eye. "The <emphasis>Maid of Orleans</emphasis> sails for New Marseille and Avalon on the west coast in… let me see… five days. If you would rather wait another week, you can book places on the <emphasis>Sea Queen</emphasis> for the east. She puts in at St. Augustine, St. Denis, and Hanover, then continues on to London."</p>
   <p>"We can reach the interior as easily from either coast," Harris said.</p>
   <p>"Just so." Audubon nodded. "We would have to wait longer to leave for the east, the journey would be longer, and I would not care to set out from Hanover in any case. I have too many friends in the capital. With the kindest intentions in the world, they would sweep us up in their social whirl, and we should be weeks getting free of it. The <emphasis>Maid of Orleans</emphasis> it shall be."</p>
   <p>"You won't be sorry, sir. She's a fine ship." The clerk spoke with professional enthusiasm. He took out a book of ticket forms and inked his pen. "In whose names shall I make these out?"</p>
   <p>"I am John James Audubon," Audubon replied. "With me travels my friend and colleague, Mr. Edward Harris."</p>
   <p>"Audubon?" The clerk started to write, then looked up, his face aglow. <emphasis>"The</emphasis> Audubon? The artist? The naturalist?"</p>
   <p>Audubon exchanged a secret smile with Edward Harris. Being recognized never failed to gratify him: he loved himself well enough to crave reminding that others loved him, too. When he swung back toward the clerk, he tried to make the smile modest. "I have the honor to be he, yes."</p>
   <p>The clerk thrust out his hand. As Audubon shook it, the young man said, "I cannot tell you how pleased I am to make your acquaintance, sir. Mr. Hiram Bartlett, the chairman of the shipping line, is a subscriber to your <emphasis>Birds and Viviparous Ouadrupeds of Northern Terranova and Atlantis—</emphasis>the double elephant folio edition. He sometimes brings in one volume or another for the edification of his staff. I admire your art and your text in almost equal measure, and that is the truth."</p>
   <p>"You do me too much credit," Audubon said, in lieu of strutting and preening like a courting passenger pigeon. He was also glad to learn how prosperous Bartlett was. No one but a rich man could afford the volumes of the double elephant folio. They were big enough to show almost every bird and most beasts at life size, even if he had twisted poses and bent necks almost unnaturally here and there to fit creatures onto the pages' Procrustean bed.</p>
   <p>"Are you traveling to Atlantis to continue your researches?" the clerk asked eagerly.</p>
   <p>"If fate is kind, yes," Audubon replied. "Some of the creatures I hope to see are less readily found than they were in years gone by, while I" —he sighed —"I fear I am less well able to find them than I was in years gone by. Yet a man can do only what it is given to him to do, and I intend to try."</p>
   <p>"If they're there, John, you'll find them," Harris said.</p>
   <p>"God grant it be so," Audubon said. "What is the fare aboard the <emphasis>Maid of Orleans?"</emphasis></p>
   <p>"A first-class cabin for two, sir, is a hundred twenty livres," the clerk said. "A second-class cabin is eighty livres, while one in steerage is a mere thirty-five livres. But I fear I cannot recommend steerage for gentlemen of your quality. It lacks the comforts to which you will have become accustomed."</p>
   <p>"I've lived rough. Once I get to Atlantis, I expect I shall live rough again," Audubon said. "But, unlike some gentlemen of the Protestant persuasion" —he fondly nudged Edward Harris —"I don't make the mistake of believing comfort is sinful. Let us travel first class."</p>
   <p>"I don't believe comfort is sinful, and you know it," Harris said. "We want to get you where you're going and keep you as healthy and happy as we can while we're doing it. First class, by all means."</p>
   <p>"First class it shall be, then." The clerk wrote up the tickets.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Audubon boarded the <emphasis>Maid of Orleans</emphasis> with a curious blend of anticipation and dread. The sidewheeler was as modem a steamship as any, but she was still a ship, one that would soon put to sea. Even going up the gangplank, his stomach gave a premonitory lurch.</p>
   <p>He laughed and tried to make light of it, both to Harris and to himself. "When I think how many times I've put to sea in a sailing ship, at the mercy of wind and wave, I know how foolish I am to fret about a voyage like this," he said.</p>
   <p>"You said it to the clerk last week: you can only do what you can do." Harris was blessed with both a calm stomach and a calm disposition. If opposites attracted, he and Audubon made a natural pair.</p>
   <p>The purser strode up to them. Brass buttons gleamed on his blue wool coat; sweat gleamed on his face. "You gentlemen are traveling together?" he said. "If you would be kind enough to show me your tickets… ?"</p>
   <p>"But of course," Audubon said. He and Harris produced them.</p>
   <p>"I thank you." The purser checked them against a list he carried in one of his jacket's many pockets. "Mr. Audubon and Mr. Harris, is it? Very good. We have you in Cabin 12, the main deck on the starboard side. That's on the right as you look forward, if you haven't gone to sea before."</p>
   <p>"I'm afraid I have," Audubon said. The purser took off his cap and scratched his balding crown, but Audubon meant it exactly as he'd phrased it. He nodded to Harris and to the free Negro pushing a wheeled cart that held their baggage. "Let's see what we've got, then."</p>
   <p>They had a cabin with two beds, a chest of drawers, and a basin and pitcher on top of it: about what they would have had in an inn of reasonable quality, though smaller. <emphasis>In an inn, though, I'm not likely to drown,</emphasis> Audubon thought. He didn't suppose he was <emphasis>likely</emphasis> to drown on the <emphasis>Maid of Orleans,</emphasis> but if the seas got rough he would wish he were dead.</p>
   <p>He gave the Negro half a livre, for the luggage, once unloaded from the cart, filled the cabin almost to the bursting point. Neither Audubon nor Harris was a dandy; they had no extraordinary amount of clothes. But Audubon's watercolors and paper filled up a couple of trunks, and the jars and the raw spirits they would use to preserve specimens took up a couple of more. And each of them had a shotgun for gathering specimens and a newfangled revolver for self-protection.</p>
   <p>"Leave enough room so you'll be able to get out and come to the galley when you're hungry," the purser said helpfully.</p>
   <p>"Thank you so much." Audubon hoped his sarcasm would freeze the man, but the purser, quite unfrozen, tipped his cap and left the cabin. Audubon muttered in pungent French.</p>
   <p>"Never mind, John," Harris said. "We're here, and we'll weigh anchor soon. After that, no worries till we get to Avalon."</p>
   <p><emphasis>No worries for you.</emphasis> But Audubon kept that to himself. Harris couldn't help having a tranquil stomach, any more than the artist could help having a nervous one. Audubon only wished his were calm.</p>
   <p>He also wished the <emphasis>Maid of Orleans</emphasis> sailed at the appointed hour, or even on the appointed day. <emphasis>Thursday, the 6th day of April, 1843, at half past 10 in the morning,</emphasis> the clerk had written on each ticket in a fine round hand. Audubon and Harris were aboard in good time. But half past ten came and went without departure. All of Thursday came and went. Passengers kept right on boarding. Stevedores kept on carrying sacks of sugar and rice into the ship's hold. Only the stuffed quail and artichokes and asparagus and the really excellent champagne in the first-class galley went some little way toward reconciling Audubon to being stuck on the steamship an extra day.</p>
   <p>Finally, on Friday afternoon, the <emphasis>Maid of Orleans'</emphasis> engine rumbled to life. Its engine had a deeper, stronger note than the one that had propelled the <emphasis>Augustus Caesar</emphasis> down the Big Muddy. The deck thrummed under Audubon's shoes.</p>
   <p>Officers bawled commands as smoke belched from the steamship's stacks. Sailors took in the lines that secured the ship to the quay. Others, grunting with effort, manned the capstan. One link at a time, they brought up the heavy chain and anchor that had held the sidewheeler in place.</p>
   <p>Watching them, Harris said, "One of these days, steam will power the capstan as well as the paddlewheels."</p>
   <p>"You could be right," Audubon replied. "The sailors must hope you are."</p>
   <p>"Steam is the coming thing. You mark my words," Harris said. "Steamships, railroads, factories—who knows what else?"</p>
   <p>"So long as they don't make a steam-powered painter, I'll do well enough," Audubon said.</p>
   <p>"A steam-powered painter? You come up with the maddest notions, John." Edward Harris laughed. Slowly, though, the mirth faded from his face. "With a mechanical pantograph, your notion might almost come true."</p>
   <p>"I wasn't thinking of that so much," Audubon told him. "I was thinking of this new trick of light-writing people have started using the last few years. If it gave pictures in color, not shades of gray, and if you could make —no, they say <emphasis>take —a.</emphasis> light-writing picture fast enough to capture motion… well, if you could, painters would fall on thin times, I fear."</p>
   <p>"Those are hefty <emphasis>ifs.</emphasis> It won't happen soon, if it ever does," Harris said.</p>
   <p>"Oh, yes. I know." Audubon nodded. "I doubt I'll have to carry a hod in my fading years. My son will likely make a living as a painter, too. But you were talking about days to come. May I not think of them as well?"</p>
   <p>The steamship's whistle screamed twice, warning that she was about to move away from the quay. Her paddle wheels spun slowly in reverse, backing her out into the Big Muddy. Then one wheel stopped while the other continued to revolve. Along with the rudder, that swung the <emphasis>Maid of Orleans'</emphasis> bow downstream. Another blast from the whistle —a triumphant one —and more smoke pouring from her stacks, she started down the great river toward the Bay of Mexico. Though she hadn't yet reached the sea, Audubon's stomach flinched.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The Big Muddy's delta stretched far out into the Bay of Mexico. As soon as the <emphasis>Maid of Orleans</emphasis> left the river and got out into the bay, her motion changed. Her pitch and roll were nothing to speak of, not to the crew and not to most of the passengers. But they were enough to send Audubon and a few other unfortunates running for the rail. After a couple of minutes that seemed like forever, he wearily straightened, mouth foul and burning, eyes streaming with tears. He was rid of what ailed him, at least for the moment.</p>
   <p>A steward with a tray of glasses nodded deferentially. "Some punch, sir, to help take the taste away?"</p>
   <p><emphasis>"Merci. Mon Dieu, merci beaucoup"</emphasis> Audubon said, tormented out of English.</p>
   <p><emphasis>"Pas de quoi"</emphasis> the steward replied. Any man on a ship sailing from New Orleans and touching in the southern parts of Atlantis had to speak some French.</p>
   <p>Audubon sipped and let rum and sweetened lemon juice clean his mouth. When he swallowed, he feared he would have another spasm, but the punch stayed down. Reassuring warmth spread from his middle. Two more gulps emptied the glass. "God bless you!" he said.</p>
   <p>"My pleasure, sir. We see some every time out." The steward offered restoratives to Audubon's fellow sufferers. They fell on him with glad cries. He even got a kiss from a nice-looking young woman—but only after she'd taken a good swig from her glass of punch.</p>
   <p>Feeling human in a mournful way, Audubon walked up toward the bow. The breeze of the ship's passage helped him forget about his unhappy innards… for now. Gulls screeched overhead. A common tern dove into the sea, and came up with a fish in its beak. It didn't get to enjoy the meal. A herring gull flapped after it and made it spit out the fish before it could swallow. The gull got the dainty; the robbed tern flew off to try its luck somewhere else.</p>
   <p>On the southern horizon lay the island of Nueva Galicia, about forty miles southeast of the delta. Only a little steam rose above Mount Isabella, near the center of the island. Audubon had been a young man the last time the volcano erupted. He remembered ash raining down on New Orleans.</p>
   <p>He looked east toward Mount Pensacola at the mouth of the bay. Pensacola had blown its stack more recently—only about ten years earlier, in fact. For now, though, no ominous plume of black rose in that direction. Audubon nodded to himself. He wouldn't have to worry about making the passage east during an eruption. When Mount Pensacola burst into flame, rivers of molten rock ran steaming into the sea, pushing the Terranovan coastline a little farther south and east. Ships couldn't come too close to observe the awe-inspiring spectacle, for the volcano threw stones to a distance coast artillery only dreamt of. Most splashed into the Bay of Mexico, of course, but who would ever forget the <emphasis>Black Prince,</emphasis> holed and sunk by a flying boulder the size of a cow back in '93?</p>
   <p>The <emphasis>Maid of Orleans</emphasis> steamed sedately eastward. The waves weren't too bad; Audubon found that repeated doses of rum punch worked something not far from a miracle when it came to settling his stomach. If it did twinge now and again, the rum kept him from caring. And the lemon juice, he told himself, held scurvy at bay.</p>
   <p>Mount Pensacola was smoking when the sidewheeler passed it near sunset. But the cloud of steam rising from the conical peak, like that above Mount Isabella, was thin and pale, not broad and black and threatening.</p>
   <p>Edward Harris came up alongside Audubon by the port rail. "A pretty view," Harris remarked.</p>
   <p>"It is indeed," Audubon said.</p>
   <p>"I'm surprised not to find you sketching," Harris told him. "Sunset tinging the cloud above the mountain with pink against the deepening blue… What could be more picturesque?"</p>
   <p>"Nothing, probably." Audubon laughed in some embarrassment. "But I've drunk enough of that splendid rum punch to make my right hand forget its cunning."</p>
   <p>"I don't suppose I can blame you, not when <emphasis>mal de mer</emphasis> torments you so," Harris said. "I hope the sea will be calmer the next time you come this way."</p>
   <p>"So do I —if there is a next time," Audubon said. "I am not young, Edward, and I grow no younger. I'm bound for Atlantis to do things and see things while I still may. The land changes year by year, and so do I. Neither of us will be again what we were."</p>
   <p>Harris —calm, steady, dependable Harris—smiled and set a hand on his friend's shoulder. "You've drunk yourself sad, that's what you've done. There's more to you than to many a man half your age."</p>
   <p>"Good of you to say so, though we both know it's not so, not any more. As for the rum…" Audubon shook his head. "I knew this might be my last voyage when I got on the <emphasis>Augustus Caesar</emphasis> in St. Louis. Growing up is a time of firsts, of beginnings."</p>
   <p>"Oh, yes." Harris' smile grew broader. Audubon had a good idea which first he was remembering.</p>
   <p>But the painter wasn't finished. "Growing up is a time for firsts, yes," he repeated. "Growing old… Growing old is a time for endings, for lasts. And I do fear this will be my last long voyage."</p>
   <p>"Well, make the most of it if it is," Harris said. "Shall we repair to the galley? Turtle soup tonight, with a saddle of mutton to follow." He smacked his lips.</p>
   <p>Harris certainly made the most of the supper. Despite his ballasting of rum, Audubon didn't. A few spoonfuls of soup, a halfhearted attack on the mutton and the roast potatoes accompanying it, and he felt full to the danger point. "We might as well have traveled second class, or even steerage," he said sadly. "The difference in cost lies mostly in the victuals, and I'll never get my money's worth at a table that rolls."</p>
   <p>"I'll just have to do it for both of us, then." Harris poured brandy-spiked gravy over a second helping of mutton. His campaign with fork and knife was serious and methodical, and soon reduced the mutton to nothing. He looked around hopefully. "I wonder what the sweet course is."</p>
   <p>It was a cake baked in the shape of the <emphasis>Maid of Orleans</emphasis> and stuffed with nuts, candied fruit, and almond paste. Harris indulged immoderately. Audubon watched with a strange smile, half jealous, half wistful.</p>
   <p>He went to bed not long after supper. The first day of a sea voyage always told on him, more than ever as he got older. The mattress was as comfortable as the one in the inn back in New Orleans. It might have been softer than the one he slept on at home. But it was unfamiliar, and so he tossed and turned for a while, trying to find the most comfortable position. Even as he tossed, he laughed at himself. Before long, he'd sleep wrapped in a blanket on bare ground in Atlantis. Would he twist and turn there, too? He nodded. Of course he would. Nodding still, he dozed off.</p>
   <p>He hadn't been asleep long before Harris came in. His friend was humming "Pretty Black Eyes," a song popular in New Orleans as they set out. Audubon didn't think the other man even knew he was doing it. Harris got into his night-shirt, pissed in the chamber pot under his bed, blew out the oil lamp Audubon had left burning, and lay down. He was snoring in short order. Harris always denied that he snored — and why not? He never heard himself.</p>
   <p>Audubon laughed once more. He tossed and twisted and yawned. Pretty soon, he was snoring again himself.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>When he went out on deck the next morning, the <emphasis>Maid of Orleans</emphasis> might have been the only thing God ever made besides the sea. Terranova had vanished behind her; Atlantis still lay a thousand miles ahead. The steamship had entered the Hesperian Gulf, the wide arm of the North Atlantic that separated the enormous island and its smaller attendants from the continent to the west.</p>
   <p>Audubon looked south and east. He'd been born on Santo Tomas, one of those lesser isles. He was brought to France three years later, and so escaped the convulsions that wracked the island when its colored slaves rose up against their masters in a war where neither side asked for quarter or gave it. Blacks ruled Santo Tomas to this day. Not many whites were left on the island. Audubon had only a few faded childhood memories of his first home. He'd never cared to go back, even if he could have without taking his life in his hands.</p>
   <p>Edward Harris strolled out on deck. "Good morning," he said. "I hope you slept well?"</p>
   <p>"Well enough, thanks," Audubon answered. <emphasis>I would have done better without "Pretty Black Eyes," but such is life</emphasis> "Yourself?"</p>
   <p>"Not bad, not bad." Harris eyed him. "You look… less greenish than you did yesterday. The bracing salt air, I suppose?"</p>
   <p>"It could be. Or maybe I'm getting used to the motion." As soon as Audubon said that, as soon as he thought about his stomach, he gulped. He pointed an accusing finger at his friend. "There—you see? Just asking was enough to jinx me."</p>
   <p>"Well, come have some breakfast, then. Nothing like a good mess of ham and eggs or something like that to get you ready for… Are you all right?"</p>
   <p>"No," Audubon gasped, leaning out over the rail.</p>
   <p>He breakfasted lightly, on toasted ship's biscuit and coffee and rum punch. He didn't usually start the day with strong spirits, but he didn't usually start the day with a bout of seasickness, either. A <emphasis>good thing, too, or I'd have died years ago,</emphasis> he thought. <emphasis>I hope I would anyhow.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Beside him in the galley, Harris worked his way through fried eggs and ham and sausage and bacon and maize-meal mush. Blotting his lips with a snowy linen napkin, he said, "That was monstrous fine." He patted his pot belly.</p>
   <p>"So glad you enjoyed it," Audubon said tonelessly.</p>
   <p>Once or twice over the next three days, the <emphasis>Maid of Orleans</emphasis> came close enough to another ship to make out her sails or the smoke rising from her stack. A pod of whales came up to blow nearby before sounding again. Most of the time, though, the sidewheeler might have been alone on the ocean.</p>
   <p>Audubon was on deck again the third afternoon, when the sea —suddenly, as those things went—changed from greenish gray to a deeper, richer blue. He looked around for Harris, and spotted him not far away, drinking rum punch and chatting with a personable young woman whose curls were the color of fire.</p>
   <p>"Edward!" Audubon said. "We've entered the Bay Stream!"</p>
   <p>"Have we?" The news didn't seem to have the effect on Harris that Audubon wanted. His friend turned back to the redheaded woman—who also held a glass of punch —and said, "John is wild for nature in every way you can imagine." Spoken in a different tone of voice, it would have been a compliment. Maybe it still was. Audubon hoped he only imagined Harris' faintly condescending note.</p>
   <p>"Is he?" The woman didn't seem much interested in Audubon one way or the other. "What about you, Eddie?"</p>
   <p><emphasis>Eddie?</emphasis> Audubon had trouble believing his ears. No one had ever called Harris such a thing in his hearing before. And Harris… smiled. "Well, Beth, I'll tell you — I am, too. But some parts of nature interest me more than others." He set his free hand on her arm. She smiled, too.</p>
   <p>He was a widower. He could chase if that suited his fancy, not that Beth seemed to need much chasing. Audubon admired a pretty lady as much as anyone —more than most, for with his painter's eye he saw more than most—but was a thoroughly married man, and didn't slide from admiration to pursuit. He hoped Lucy was well.</p>
   <p>Finding Harris temporarily distracted, Audubon went back to the rail himself. By then, the <emphasis>Maid of Orleans</emphasis> had left the cooler waters by the east coast of Terranova behind and fully entered the warm current coming up from the Bay of Mexico. Even the bits of seaweed floating in the ocean looked different now. Audubon's main zoological interests did center on birds and viviparous quadrupeds. All the same, he wished he would have thought to net up some of the floating algae in the cool water and then some of these so he could properly compare them.</p>
   <p>He turned around to say as much to Harris, only to discover that his friend and Beth were no longer on deck. Had Harris gone off to pursue his own zoological interests? Well, more power to him if he had. Audubon looked back into the ocean, and was rewarded with the sight of a young sea turtle, not much bigger than the palm of his hand, delicately nibbling a strand of the new seaweed. Next to the rewards Harris might be finding, it didn't seem like much, but it was definitely better than nothing.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Like the Sun, Atlantis, for Audubon, rose in the east. That blur on the horizon—for a little while, you could wonder if it was a distant cloudbank, but only for a little while. Before long, it took on the unmistakable solidity of land. To the Breton and Galician fishermen who'd found it first, almost four hundred years before, it would have sent the setting sun to bed early.</p>
   <p>"Next port of call is New Marseille, sir," the purser said, tipping his cap to Audubon as he went by.</p>
   <p>"Yes, of course," the artist replied, "but I'm bound for Avalon."</p>
   <p>"Even so, sir, you'll have to clear customs at the first port of call in Atlantis," the other man reminded him. "The States are fussy about these things. If you don't have a New Marseille customs stamp on your passport, they won't let you off the ship in Avalon."</p>
   <p>"It's a nuisance, to open all my trunks for the sake of a stamp," Audubon said. The purser shrugged the shrug of a man with right, or at least regulations, on his side. And he told the truth: the United States of Atlantis <emphasis>were</emphasis> fussy about who visited them. <emphasis>Do as we do,</emphasis> they might have said, <emphasis>or stay away.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Not that coming ashore at New Marseille was a hardship. On the contrary. Warmed by the Bay Stream, the city basked in an almost unending May. Farther north, in Avalon, it seemed to be April most of the time. And then the Bay Stream curled north and east around the top of Atlantis and delivered the rest of its warmth to the north of France, to the British Isles, and to Scandinavia. The east coast of Atlantis, where the winds swept across several hundred miles of mountains and lowlands before they finally arrived, was an altogether darker, harsher place.</p>
   <p>But Audubon was in New Marseille, and if it wasn't veritably May, it was the middle of April, which came close enough. A glance as he and Harris carted their cases to the customs shed sufficed to tell him he'd left Terranova behind. Oh, the magnolias that shaded some nearby streets weren't much different from the ones he could have found near New Orleans. But the gink-goes on other thoroughfares… only one other variety of ginkgo grew anyplace else in the world: in China. And the profusion of squat cycads with tufts of leaves sprouting from the tops of squat trunks also had few counterparts anywhere in the temperate zone.</p>
   <p>The customs official, by contrast, seemed much like customs officials in every other kingdom and republic Audubon had ever visited. He frowned as he examined their declaration, and frowned even more as he opened up their baggage to confirm it. "You have a considerable quantity of spirits here," he said. "A dutiable quantity, in fact."</p>
   <p>"They aren't intended for drinking or for resale, sir," Audubon said, "but for the preservation of scientific specimens."</p>
   <p>"John Audubon's name and artistry are known throughout the civilized world," Edward Harris said.</p>
   <p>"I've heard of the gentleman myself. I admire his work, what I've seen of it," the official replied. "But the law does not consider intent. It considers quantity. You will not tell me these strong spirits <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> be drunk?"</p>
   <p>"No," Audubon admitted reluctantly.</p>
   <p>"Well, then," the customs man said. "You owe the fisc of Atlantis… let me see…" He checked a table thumbtacked to the wall behind him. "You owe twenty-two eagles and, ah, fourteen cents."</p>
   <p>Fuming, Audubon paid. The customs official gave him a receipt, which he didn't want, and the requisite stamp in his passport, which he did. As he and Harris trundled their chattels back to the <emphasis>Maid of Orleans,</emphasis> a small bird flew past them. "Look, John!" Harris said. "Wasn't that a gray-throated green?"</p>
   <p>Not even the sight of the Atlantean warbler could cheer Audubon. "Well, what if it was?" he said, still mourning the money he'd hoped he wouldn't have to spend.</p>
   <p>His friend knew what ailed him. "When we get to Avalon, paint a portrait or two," Harris suggested. "You'll make it up, and more besides."</p>
   <p>Audubon shook his head. "I don't <emphasis>want</emphasis> to do that, dammit." When thwarted, he could act petulant as a child. "I grudge the time I'd have to spend. Every moment counts. I have not so many days left myself, and the upland honkers… Well, who can say if they have any left at all?"</p>
   <p>"They'll be there." As usual, Harris radiated confidence.</p>
   <p>"Will they?" Audubon, by contrast, careened from optimism to the slough of despond on no known schedule. At the moment, not least because of the customs man, he was mired in gloom. "When fishermen first found this land, a dozen species of honkers filled it: filled it as buffalo fill the plains of Terranova. Now… now a few may be left in the wildest parts of Atlantis. Or, even as we speak, the last ones may be dying—may already have died! —under an eagle's claws or the jaws of a pack of wild dogs or to some rude trapper's shotgun."</p>
   <p>"The buffalo are starting to go, too," Harris remarked.</p>
   <p>That only agitated Audubon more. "I must hurry! Hurry, do you hear me?"</p>
   <p>"Well, you can't go anywhere till the <emphasis>Maid of Orleans</emphasis> sails," Harris said reasonably.</p>
   <p>"One day soon, a railroad will run from New Marseille to Avalon," Audubon said. Atlantis was building railroads almost as fast as England: faster than France, faster than any of the new Terranovan republics. But soon was not yet, and he <emphasis>did</emphasis> have to wait for the steamship to head north.</p>
   <p>Passengers left the <emphasis>Maid of Orleans.</emphasis> Beth got off, which made Harris glum. Others came aboard. Longshoremen carried crates and boxes and barrels and bags ashore. Others brought fresh cargo onto the ship. Passengers and longshoremen alike moved too slowly to suit Audubon. Again, he could only fume and pace the mercifully motionless deck. At last, late the next afternoon, the <emphasis>Maid of Orleans</emphasis> steamed towards Avalon.</p>
   <p>She stayed close to shore on the two-and-a-half-day journey. It was one of the most beautiful routes anywhere in the world. Titanic redwoods and sequoias grew almost down to the shore. They rose so tall and straight, they might almost have been the columns of a colossal outdoor cathedral.</p>
   <p>But that cathedral could have been dedicated to puzzlement and confusion. The only trees like the enormous evergreens of Atlantis were those on the Pacific coast of Terranova, far, far away. Why did they thrive here, survive there, and exist nowhere else? Audubon had no more answer than any other naturalist, though he dearly wished for one. <emphasis>That</emphasis> would crown a career! He feared it was a crown he was unlikely to wear.</p>
   <p>The <emphasis>Maid of Orleans</emphasis> passed a small fishing town called Newquay without stopping. Having identified the place on his map, Audubon was pleased when the purser confirmed he'd done it right. "If anything happens to the navigator, sir, I'm sure we'd be in good hands with you," the man said, and winked to show he didn't aim to be taken too seriously.</p>
   <p>Audubon gave him a dutiful smile and went back to eyeing the map. Atlantis' west coast and the east coast of North Terranova a thousand miles away put him in mind of two pieces of a world-sized jigsaw puzzle: their outlines almost fit together. The same was true for the bulge of Brazil in South Terranova and the indentation in West Africa's coastline on the other side of the Atlantic. And the shape of Atlantis' eastern coast corresponded to that of western Europe in a more general way.</p>
   <p>What did that mean? Audubon knew he was far from the first to wonder. How could anyone who looked at a map help but wonder? Had Atlantis and Terranova been joined once upon a time? Had Africa and Brazil? How could they have been, with so much sea between? He saw no way it could be possible. Neither did anyone else. But when you looked at the map…</p>
   <p>"Coincidence," Harris said when he mentioned it at supper.</p>
   <p>"Maybe so." Audubon cut meat from a goose drumstick. His stomach was behaving better these days —and the seas stayed mild. "But if it is a coincidence, don't you think it's a large one?"</p>
   <p>"World's a large place." Harris paused to take a sip of wine. "It has room in it for a large coincidence or three, don't you think?"</p>
   <p>"Maybe so," Audubon said again, "but when you look at the maps, it seems as if those matches ought to spring from reason, not happenstance."</p>
   <p>"Tell me how the ocean got in between them, then." Harris aimed a finger at him like a pistol barrel. "And if you say it was Noah's flood, I'll pick up that bottle of fine Bordeaux and clout you over the head with it."</p>
   <p>"I wasn't going to say anything of the sort," Audubon replied. "Noah's flood may have washed over these lands, but I can't see how it could have washed them apart while still leaving their coastlines so much like each other."</p>
   <p>"So it must be coincidence, then."</p>
   <p>"I don't believe it <emphasis>must</emphasis> be anything, <emphasis>mon vieux,"</emphasis> Audubon said. "I believe we don't know what it is —or, I admit, if it's anything at all. Maybe they will one day, but not now. For now, it's a puzzlement. We need puzzlements, don't you think?"</p>
   <p>"For now, John, I need the gravy," Harris said. "Would you kindly pass it to me? Goes mighty well with the goose."</p>
   <p>It did, too. Audubon poured some over the moist, dark meat on his plate before handing his friend the gravy boat. Harris wanted to ignore puzzlements when he could. Not Audubon. They reminded him not only of how much he—and everyone else —didn't know yet, but also of how much he —in particular—might still find out.</p>
   <p>As <emphasis>much as I have time for,</emphasis> he thought, and took another bite of goose.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Avalon rose on six hills. The city fathers kept scouting for a seventh so they could compare their town to Rome, but there wasn't another bump to be found for miles around. The west-facing Bay of Avalon gave the city that bore its name perhaps the finest harbor in Atlantis. A century and a half before, the bay was a pirates' roost. The buccaneers swept out to plunder the Hesperian Gulf for most of a lifetime, till <emphasis>a</emphasis> British and Dutch fleet drove them back to their nest and then smoked them out of it.</p>
   <p>City streets still remembered the swashbuckling past: Goldbeard Way<sub>7</sub> Valjean Avenue, Cutpurse Charlie Lane. But two Atlantean steam frigates patrolled the harbor. Fishing boats, bigger merchantmen —some steamers, other sailing ships—and liners like the <emphasis>Maid of Orleans</emphasis> moved in and out. The pirates might be remembered, but they were gone.</p>
   <p><emphasis>May it not be so with the honkers.</emphasis> Audubon thought as the <emphasis>Maid of Orleans</emphasis> tied up at a pier. <emphasis>Please, God, let it not be so.</emphasis> He crossed himself. He didn't know if the prayer would help, but it couldn't hurt, so he sent it up for whatever it might be worth.</p>
   <p>Harris pointed to a man coming up the pier. "Isn't that Gordon Coates?"</p>
   <p>"It certainly is." Audubon waved to the man who published his work in Atlantis. Coates, a short, round fellow with side whiskers even bushier than Audubon's, waved back. His suit was of shiny silk; a stovepipe hat sat at a jaunty angle on his head. Audubon cupped his hands in front of his mouth. "How are you, Gordon?"</p>
   <p>"Oh, tolerable. Maybe a bit better than tolerable," Coates replied. "So you're haring off into the wilderness again, are you?" He was a city man to the tips of his manicured fingers. The only time he went out to the countryside was to take in a horse race. He knew his ponies, too. When he bet, he won… more often than not, anyhow.</p>
   <p>He had a couple of servants waiting with carts to take charge of the travelers' baggage. He and Audubon and Harris clasped hands and clapped one another on the back when the gangplank went down and passengers could disembark. "Where are you putting us up?" asked Harris, who always thought about things like where he would be put up. Thanks to his thoughts about such things, Audubon had stayed in some places more comfortable than those where he might have if he made his own arrangements.</p>
   <p>"How does the Hesperian Queen sound?" Coates answered.</p>
   <p>"Like a pirate's kept woman," Audubon answered, and the publisher sent up gales of laughter. Audubon went on, "Is it near a livery stable or a horse market? I'll want to get my animals as soon as I can." Harris let out a sigh. Audubon pretended not to hear it.</p>
   <p>"Not too far, not too far," Coates said. Then he pointed up into the sky. "Look— an eagle! There's an omen for you, if you like."</p>
   <p>The large, white-headed bird sailed off toward the south. Audubon knew it was likely bound for the city dump, to scavenge there. White-headed eagles had thrived since men came to Atlantis. Seeing this one secretly disappointed Audubon. He wished it were a red-crested eagle, the Atlantean national bird. But the mighty raptors—by all accounts, the largest in the world —had fallen into a steep decline along with the honkers, which were their principal prey.</p>
   <p>"Well," he said, "the Hesperian Queen."</p>
   <p>The last time he was in Avalon, the hotel had had another name and another owner. It had come up in the world since. So had Avalon, which was visibly bigger and visibly richer than it had been ten years —or was it twelve now?—before.</p>
   <p>Harris noticed, too. Harris generally noticed things like that. "You do well for yourselves here," he told Gordon Coates over beefsteaks at supper.</p>
   <p>"Not too bad, not too bad," the publisher said. "I'm about to put out a book by a chap who thinks he's written the great Atlantean novel, and he lives right here in town. I hope he's right. You never can tell."</p>
   <p>"You don't believe it, though," Audubon said.</p>
   <p>"Well, no," Coates admitted. "Everybody always thinks he's written the great Atlantean novel —unless he comes from Terranova or England. Sometimes even then. Mr. Hawthorne has a better chance than some —a better chance than most, I daresay—but not <emphasis>that</emphasis> much better."</p>
   <p>"What's it called?" Harris asked.</p>
   <p><emphasis>"The Crimson Brand"</emphasis> Coates said. "Not a bad title, if I say so myself—and I do, because it's mine. <emphasis>He</emphasis> wanted to name it <emphasis>The Shores of a Different Sea"</emphasis> He yawned, as if to say authors were hopeless with titles. Then, pointing at Audubon, he <emphasis>did</emphasis> say it: "I'd have called your books something else, too, if they weren't also coming out in England and Terranova. <emphasis>Birds and Critters,</emphasis> maybe. Who remembers what a quadruped is, let alone a viviparous one?"</p>
   <p>"They've done well enough with the name I gave them," Audubon said.</p>
   <p>"Well enough, sure, but they might've done better. I could've made you <emphasis>big"</emphasis> Coates was a man with an eye for the main chance. Making Audubon <emphasis>big —</emphasis> he lingered lovingly over the word—would have made him money.</p>
   <p>"I know why folks here don't know quadrupeds from a hole in the ground," Harris said. "Atlantis hardly had any before it got discovered. No snakes in Ireland, no… critters" —he grinned —"here, not then."</p>
   <p>"No <emphasis>viviparous</emphasis> quadrupeds." Audubon had drunk enough wine to make him most precise —but not too much to keep him from pronouncing <emphasis>viviparous.</emphasis> "A very great plenty of lizards and turtles and frogs and toads and salamanders —and snakes, of course, though snakes lack four legs of quadrupedality." He was proud of himself for that.</p>
   <p>"Sure enough, snakes haven't got a leg to stand on." Harris guffawed.</p>
   <p>"Well, we have critters enough now, by God," Coates said. "Everything from mice on up to elk. Some of 'em we wanted, some we got anyway. Try and keep rats and mice from coming aboard ship. Yeah, go ahead and try. Good luck—you'll need it."</p>
   <p>"How many indigenous Atlantean creatures are no more because of them?" Audubon said.</p>
   <p>"Beats me," Coates answered. "Little too late to worry about it now, anyway, don't you think?"</p>
   <p>"I hope not," Audubon said. "I hope it's not too late for them. I hope it's not too late for me." He took another sip of wine. "And I know the viviparous creature responsible for the greatest number of those sad demises here."</p>
   <p>"Rats?" Coates asked.</p>
   <p>"Weasels, I bet," Harris said.</p>
   <p>Audubon shook his head at each of them in turn. He pointed an index finger at his own chest. "Man," he said.</p>
   <p>He rode out of Avalon three days later. Part of the time he spent buying horses and tackle for them; that, he didn't begrudge. The rest he spent with Gordon Coates, meeting with subscribers and potential subscribers for his books; that, he did. He was a better businessman than most of his fellow artists, and normally wouldn't have resented keeping customers happy and trolling for new ones. If nobody bought your art, you had a devil of a time making more of it. As a younger man, he'd worked at several other trades, hated them all, and done well at none. He knew how lucky he was to make a living doing what he loved, and how much work went into what others called luck.</p>
   <p>To his relief, he did escape without painting portraits. Even before he set out from New Orleans, he'd felt time's hot breath at his heels. He felt himself aging, getting weaker, getting feebler. In another few years, maybe even in another year or two, he would lack the strength and stamina for a journey into the wilds of central Atlantis. And even if he had it, he might not find any honkers left to paint.</p>
   <p><emphasis>I may not find any now,</emphasis> he thought. That ate at him like vitriol. He kept seeing a hunter or a lumberjack with a shotgun…</p>
   <p>Setting out from Avalon, Audubon might almost have traveled through the French or English countryside. Oh, the farms here were larger than they were in Europe, with more meadow between them. This was newly settled land; it hadn't been cultivated for centuries, sometimes for millennia. But the crops —wheat, barley, maize, potatoes—were either European or were Terranovan imports long familiar in the Old World. The fruit trees came from Europe; the nuts, again, from Europe and Terranova. Only a few stands of redwoods and Atlantean pines declared that the Hesperian Gulf lay just a few miles to the west.</p>
   <p>It was the same with the animals. Dogs yapped outside of farmhouses Chickens scratched. Cats prowled, hoping for either mice —also immigrants —or unwary chicks. Ducks and geese —ordinary domestic geese—paddled in ponds. Pigs rooted and wallowed. In the fields, cattle and sheep and horses grazed.</p>
   <p>Most people probably wouldn't have noticed the ferns that sprouted here and there or the birds on the ground, in the trees, and on the wing. Some of those birds, like ravens, ranged all over the world. Others, such as the white-headed eagle Audubon had seen in Avalon, were common in both Atlantis and Terranova (on Atlantis' eastern coast, the white-tailed eagle sometimes visited from its more usual haunts in Europe and Iceland). Still others —no one knew how many—were unique to the great island.</p>
   <p>No one but a specialist knew or cared how Atlantean gray-faced swifts differed from the chimney swifts of Terranova or little swifts from Europe. Many Atlantean thrushes were plainly the same sorts of birds as their equivalents to the west and to the east. They belonged to different species, but their plumages and habits were similar to those of the rest. The same held true for island warblers, which flitted through the trees after insects like their counterparts on the far side of the Hesperian Gulf. Yes, there were many similarities. But…</p>
   <p>"I wonder how soon we'll start seeing oil thrushes," Audubon said.</p>
   <p>"Not this close to Avalon," Harris said. "Not with so many dogs and cats and pigs running around."</p>
   <p>"I suppose not," Audubon said. "They're trusting things, and they haven't much chance of getting away."</p>
   <p>Laughing, Harris mimed flapping his fingertips. Oil thrushes' wings were bigger than that, but not by much—they couldn't fly. The birds themselves were bigger than chickens. They used their long, pointed beaks to probe the ground for worms at depths ordinary thrushes, flying thrushes, couldn't hope to reach. When the hunting was good, they laid up fat against a rainy day.</p>
   <p>But they were all but helpless against men and the beasts men had brought to Atlantis. It wasn't just that they were good eating, or that their fat, rendered down made a fine lamp oil. The real trouble was, they didn't seem to know enough to run away when a dog or a fox came after them. They weren't used to being hunted by animals that lived on the ground; the only viviparous quadrupeds on Atlantis before men arrived were bats.</p>
   <p>"Even the bats here are peculiar," Audubon muttered.</p>
   <p>"Well, so they are, but why do you say so?" Harris asked.</p>
   <p>Audubon explained his train of thought. "Where else in the world do you have bats that spend more of their time scurrying around on the ground than flying?" he went on.</p>
   <p>He thought that was a rhetorical question, but Harris said, "Aren't there also some in New Zealand?"</p>
   <p>"Are there?" Audubon said in surprise. His friend nodded. The painter scratched at his side whiskers. "Well, well. Both lands far from any others, out in the middle of the sea…"</p>
   <p>"New Zealand had its own honkers, too, or something like them," Harris said. "What the devil were they called?"</p>
   <p>"Moas," Audubon said. "I do remember that. Didn't I show you the marvelous illustrations of their remains Professor Owen did recently? The draftsmanship is astonishing. Astonishing!" The way he kissed his bunched fingertips proved him a Frenchman at heart.</p>
   <p>Edward Harris gave him a sly smile. "Surely you could do better?"</p>
   <p>"I doubt it," Audubon said. "Each man to his own bent. Making a specimen look as if it were alive on the canvas—that I can do. My talent lies there, and I've spent almost forty years now learning the tricks and turns that go with it. Showing every detail of dead bone —I'm not in the least ashamed to yield the palm to the good professor there."</p>
   <p>"If only you were a little less modest, you'd be perfect," Harris said.</p>
   <p>"It could be," Audubon said complacently, and they rode on.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The slow, deep drumming came from thirty feet up a dying pine. Harris pointed. "There he is, John! D'you see him?"</p>
   <p>"I'm not likely to miss him, not when he's the size of a raven," Audubon answered. Intent on grubs under the bark, the scarlet-cheeked woodpecker went on drumming. It was a male, which meant its crest was also scarlet. A female's crest would have been black, with a forward curl the male's lacked. That also held true for its close relatives on the Terranovan mainland, the ivory-bill and the imperial woodpecker of Mexico.</p>
   <p>Audubon dismounted, loaded his shotgun, and approached the bird. He could get closer to the scarlet-cheeked woodpecker than he could have to one of its Terranovan cousins. Like the oil thrush, like so many other Atlantean birds, the woodpecker had trouble understanding that something walking along on the ground could endanger it. Ivory-bills and imperial woodpeckers were less naive.</p>
   <p>The woodpecker raised its head and called. The sound was high and shrill, like a false note on a clarinet. Audubon paused with the gun on his shoulder, waiting to see if another bird would answer. When none did, he squeezed the trigger. The shotgun boomed, belching fireworks-smelling smoke.</p>
   <p>With a startled squawk, the scarlet-cheeked woodpecker tumbled out of the pine. It thrashed on the ground for a couple of minutes, then lay still. "Nice shot," Harris said.</p>
   <p><emphasis>"Merci,"</emphasis> Audubon answered absently.</p>
   <p>He picked up the woodpecker. It was still warm in his hands, and still crawling with mites and bird lice. No one who didn't handle wild birds freshly dead thought of such things. He brushed his palm against his trouser leg to get rid of some of the vagrants. They didn't usually trouble people, who weren't to their taste, but every once in a while…</p>
   <p>A new thought struck him. He stared at the scarlet-cheeked woodpecker. "I wonder if the parasites on Atlantean birds are as different as the birds themselves, or if they share them with the birds of Terranova."</p>
   <p>"I don't know," Harris said. "Do you want to pop some into spirits and see?"</p>
   <p>After a moment, Audubon shook his head. "No, better to let someone who truly cares about such things take care of it. I'm after honkers, by God, not lice!"</p>
   <p>"Nice specimen you took there, though," his friend said. "Scarlet-cheeks are getting scarce, too."</p>
   <p>"Not so much forest for them to hunt in as there once was," Audubon said with a sigh. "Not so much of anything in Atlantis as there once was —except men and farms and sheeps." He knew that was wrong as soon as it came out of his mouth, but let it go. "If we don't show what it was, soon it will be no more, and then it will be too late to show. Too late already for too much of it." <emphasis>Too late for me?</emphasis> he wondered. <emphasis>Please, let it not be so!</emphasis></p>
   <p>"You going to sketch now?" Harris asked.</p>
   <p>"If you don't mind. Birds are much easier to pose before they start to stiffen."</p>
   <p>"Go ahead, go ahead." Harris slid down from his horse. "I'll smoke a pipe or two and wander around a bit with my shotgun. Maybe I'll bag something else you can paint, or maybe I'll shoot supper instead. Maybe both —who knows? If I remember right, these Atlantean ducks and geese eat as well as any other kind, except canvasbacks." He was convinced canvasback ducks, properly roasted and served with loaf sugar, were the finest fowl in the world. Audubon wasn't so sure he was wrong.</p>
   <p>As Harris ambled away, Audubon set the scarlet-cheeked woodpecker on the grass and walked over to one of the pack horses. He knew which sack held his artistic supplies: his posing board and his wires, his charcoal sticks and precious paper.</p>
   <p>He remembered how, as a boy, he'd despaired of ever portraying birds in realistic poses. A bird in the hand was all very well, but a dead bird looked like nothing but a dead bird. It drooped, it sagged, it cried its lifelessness to the eye.</p>
   <p>When he studied painting with David in France, he sometimes did figure drawings from a mannequin. His cheeks heated when he recalled the articulated bird model he'd tried to make from wood and cork and wire. After endless effort, he produced something that might have done duty for a spavined dodo. His friends laughed at it. How could he get angry at them when he wanted to laugh at it, too? He ended up kicking the horrible thing to pieces.</p>
   <p>If he hadn't thought of wires… He didn't know what he would have done then. Wires let him position his birds as if they were still alive. The first kingfisher he'd posed —he knew he was on to something even before he finished. As he set up the posing board now, a shadow of that old excitement glided through him again. Even the bird's eyes had seemed to take on life again once he posed it the way he wanted.</p>
   <p>As he worked with wires now to position the woodpecker as it had clung to the tree trunk, he wished he could summon more than a shadow of the old thrill. But he'd done the same sort of thing too many times. Routine fought against art. He wasn't discovering a miracle now. He was… working.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Well, if you're working, work the best you can,</emphasis> he told himself. And practice did pay. His hands knew almost without conscious thought how best to set the wires, to pose the bird. When his hands thought he was finished, he eyed the scarlet-cheeked woodpecker. Then he moved a wire to adjust its tail's position. It used those long, stiff feathers to brace itself against the bark, almost as if it had hind legs back there.</p>
   <p>He began to sketch. He remembered the agonies of effort that went into his first tries, and how bad they were despite those agonies. He knew others who'd tried to paint, and who gave up when their earlier pieces failed to match what they wanted, what they expected. Some of them, from what he'd seen, had a real gift. But having it and honing it… Ah, what a difference! Not many were stubborn enough to keep doing the thing they wanted to do even when they couldn't do it very well. Audubon didn't know how many times he'd almost given up in despair. But when stubbornness met talent, great things could happen.</p>
   <p>The charcoal seemed to have a life of its own as it moved across the page. Audubon nodded to himself. His line remained as strong and fluid as ever. He didn't have the tremors and shakes that marked so many men's descent into age —not yet. Yet how far away from them was he? Every time the Sun rose, he came one day closer. He sketched fast, racing against his own decay.</p>
   <p>Harris' shotgun bellowed. Audubon's hand did jump then. Whose wouldn't, at the unexpected report? But that jerky line was easily rubbed out. He went on, quick and confident, and had the sketch very much the way he wanted it by the time Harris came back carrying a large dead bird by the feet.</p>
   <p>"A turkey?" Audubon exclaimed.</p>
   <p>His friend nodded, face wreathed in smiles. "Good eating tonight!"</p>
   <p>"Well, yes," Audubon said. "But who would have thought the birds could spread so fast? They were introduced in the south… it can't be more than thirty years ago, can it? And now you shoot one here."</p>
   <p>"They give better sport than oil thrushes and the like," Harris said. "At least they have the sense to get away if they see trouble coming. The sense God gave a goose, you might say—except He didn't give it to all the geese here, either."</p>
   <p>"No," Audubon said. Some of Atlantis' geese flew to other lands as well, and were properly wary. Some stayed on the great island the whole year round. Those birds weren't. Some of them flew poorly. Some couldn't fly at all, having wings as small and useless as those of the oil thrush.</p>
   <p>Honkers looked uncommonly like outsized geese with even more outsized legs. Some species even had black necks and white chin patches reminiscent of Canada geese. That frankly puzzled Audubon: it was as if God were repeating Himself in the Creation, but why? Honkers' feet had vestigial webs, too, while their bills, though laterally compressed, otherwise resembled the broad, flat beaks of ordinary geese.</p>
   <p>Audubon had seen the specimens preserved in the museum in Hanover: skeletons, a few hides, enormous greenish eggs. The most recent hide was dated 1803. He wished he hadn't remembered that. If this was a wild goose chase, a wild honker chase… then it was, that was all. He was doing all he could. He only wished he could have done it sooner. He'd tried. He'd failed. He only hoped some possibility of success remained.</p>
   <p>Harris cleaned the turkey and got a fire going. Audubon finished the sketch. "That's a good one," Harris said, glancing over at it.</p>
   <p>"Not bad," Audubon allowed —he <emphasis>bad</emphasis> caught the pose he wanted. He gutted the scarlet-cheeked woodpecker so he could preserve it. Not surprisingly, the bird's stomach was full of beetle larvae. The very name of its genus, <emphasis>Campephilus,</emphasis> meant <emphasis>grub-loving.</emphasis> He made a note in his diary and put the bird in strong spirits.</p>
   <p>"Better than that," Harris said. He cut up the turkey and skewered drumsticks on twigs.</p>
   <p>"Well, maybe," Audubon said as he took one of the skewers from his friend and started roasting the leg. He wasn't shy of praise —no, indeed. All the same, he went on, "I didn't come here for scarlet-cheeked woodpeckers. I came for honkers, by God."</p>
   <p>"You take what you get." Harris turned his twig so the drumstick cooked evenly. "You take what you get, and you hope what you get is what you came for."</p>
   <p>"Well, maybe," Audubon said again. He looked east, toward the still poorly explored heart of Atlantis. "But the harder you work, the likelier you are to get what you want. I hope I can still work hard enough. And" —he looked east once more — "I hope what I want is still there to get."</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He and Harris stayed on the main highway for most of a week. The broad, well-trodden path let them travel faster than they could have on narrower, more winding roads. But when Audubon saw the Green Ridge Mountains rising over the eastern horizon, the temptation to leave the main road got too strong to resist.</p>
   <p>"We don't want to go into the mountains anywhere near the highway," he declared. "We know no honkers live close to it, or people would have seen them, <emphasis>n'est-ce pas?"</emphasis></p>
   <p>"Stands to reason," Harris said loyally. He paused before adding, "I wouldn't mind another couple of days of halfway decent inns, though."</p>
   <p>"When we come back with what we seek, the Hesperian Queen will be none too good," Audubon said. "But we go through adversity to seek our goal."</p>
   <p>Harris sighed. "We sure do."</p>
   <p>On the main highway, fruit trees and oaks and chestnuts and elms and maples thrived. They were all imports from Europe or from Terranova. Audubon and Harris hadn't gone far from the highway before Atlantean flora reasserted itself: gink-goes and magnolias, cycads and pines, with ferns growing in profusion as an understory. Birdsongs, some familiar, others strange, doubled and redoubled as the travelers moved into less settled country. Atlantean birds seemed more comfortable with the trees they'd lived in for generations uncounted than with the brash newcomers men brought in.</p>
   <p>Not all the newcomers clung to the road. Buttercups and poppies splashed the improbably green landscape with color. Atlantean bees buzzed around the flowers that had to be unfamiliar to them… or maybe those were European honeybees, carried to the new land in the midst of the sea to serve the plants men needed, wanted, or simply liked. Curious, Audubon stopped and waited by some poppies for a closer look at the insects. They were, without a doubt, honeybees. He noted the fact in his diary. It left him oddly disappointed but not surprised.</p>
   <p>"In another hundred years," he said, climbing back onto his horse, "how much of the old Atlantis will be left? Any?"</p>
   <p>"In another hundred years," Harries replied, "it won't matter to either of us, except from beyond the Pearly Gates."</p>
   <p>"No, I suppose not." Audubon wondered if he had ten years left, or even five, let alone a hundred. "But it should matter to those who are young here. They throw away marvels without thinking of what they're doing. Wouldn't you like to see dodos preserved alive?" He tried not to recall his unfortunate bird model.</p>
   <p>"Alive? Why, I can go to Hanover and hear them speechifying," Harris said. Audubon snorted. His friend waved a placating hand. "Let it go, John. Let it go. I take your point."</p>
   <p>"I'm so glad," Audubon said with sardonic relish. "Perhaps the authorities here — your speechifying dodos—could set up parks to preserve some of what they have." He frowned. "Though how parks could keep out foxes and weasels and rats and windblown seeds, I confess I don't know. Still, it would make a start."</p>
   <p>They slept on the grass that night. The throaty hoots of an Atlantean ground owl woke Audubon somewhere near midnight. He loaded his shotgun by the faint, bloody light of the campfire's embers, in case the bird came close enough for him to spot it. Ground owls were hen-sized, more or less. They could fly, but not well. They hunted frogs and lizards and the outsized katydids that scurried through the undergrowth here. Nothing hunted them —or rather, nothing had hunted them till foxes and wild dogs and men came to Atlantis. Like so many creatures here, they couldn't seem to imagine they might become prey. Abundant once, they were scarce these days.</p>
   <p>This one's call got farther and farther away. Audubon thought about imitating it to lure the ground owl into range of his charge. In the end, he forbore. Blasting away in the middle of the night might frighten Harris into an apoplexy. And besides — Audubon yawned —he was still sleepy himself. He set down the shotgun, rolled himself in his blanket once more, and soon started snoring again.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>When Audubon woke the next morning, he saw a mouse-sized katydid's head and a couple of greenish brown legs only a yard or so from his bedroll. He swore softly: the ground owl <emphasis>had</emphasis> come by, but without hooting, so he never knew. If he'd stayed up… <emphasis>If I'd stayed up, I would be useless today,</emphasis> he thought. He needed regular doses of sleep much more than he had twenty years earlier.</p>
   <p>"I wouldn't have minded if you fired on an owl," Harris said as he built up the fire and got coffee going. "We're here for that kind of business."</p>
   <p>"Good of you to say so," Audubon replied. "It could be that I will have other chances."</p>
   <p>"And it could be that you won't. You were the one who said the old Atlantis was going under. Grab with both hands while it's here."</p>
   <p>"With the honkers, I intend to," Audubon said. "If they're there to be grabbed, grab them I shall. The ground owl… Well, who knows if it would have come when I hooted?"</p>
   <p>"I bet it would. I never knew a soul who could call birds better than you." Harris took a couple of squares of hardtack out of an oilcloth valise and handed one to Audubon. The artist waited till he had his tin cup of coffee before breakfasting. He broke his hardtack into chunks and dunked each one before eating it. The crackers were baked to a fare-thee-well so they would keep for a long time, which left them chewier than his remaining teeth could easily cope with.</p>
   <p>As he and his friend got ready to ride on, he looked again at the remains of the giant katydid. "I really ought to get some specimens of those," he remarked.</p>
   <p>"Why, in heaven's name?" Harris said. "They aren't birds, and they aren't viviparous quadrupeds, either. They aren't quadrupeds at all."</p>
   <p>"No," Audubon said slowly, "but doesn't it seem to you that here they fill the role mice play in most of the world?"</p>
   <p>"Next time I see me a six-legged chirping mouse with feelers" —Harris wiggled his forefingers above his eyes —"you can lock me up and lose the key, on account of I'll have soused my brains with the demon rum."</p>
   <p>"Or with whiskey, or gin, or whatever else you can get your hands on," Audubon said. Harris grinned and nodded. As Audubon saddled his horse, he couldn't stop thinking about Atlantean katydids and mice. <emphasis>Something</emphasis> had to scurry through the leaves and eat whatever it could find there, and so many other creatures ate mice… or, here, the insects instead. He nodded to himself. That was worth a note in the diary whenever they stopped again.</p>
   <p>They rode into a hamlet a little before noon. It boasted a saloon, a church, and a few houses. BIDEFORD HOUSE OF UNIVERSAL DEVOTION, the church declared. Strange Protestant sects flourished in Atlantis, not least because none was strong enough to dominate —and neither was his own Catholic Church.</p>
   <p>But the saloon, in its own way, was also a house of universal devotion. Bideford couldn't have held more than fifty people, but at least a dozen men sat in there, drinking and eating and talking. A silence fell when Audubon and Harris walked in. The locals stared at them. "Strangers," somebody said; he couldn't have sounded much more surprised had he announced a pair of kangaroos.</p>
   <p>Not surprisingly, the man behind the bar recovered fastest. "What'll it be, gents?" he asked.</p>
   <p>Harris was seldom at a loss when it came to his personal comforts. "Ham sandwich and a mug of beer, if you please."</p>
   <p>"That sounds good," Audubon said. "The same for me, if you'd be so kind."</p>
   <p>"Half an eagle for both of you together," the proprietor said. Some of the regulars grinned. Even without those tell-tale smiles, Audubon would have known he was being gouged. But he paid without complaint. He could afford it, and he'd be asking questions later on, and priming the pump with more silver. He wanted the locals to see he could be openhanded.</p>
   <p>The beer was… beer. The sandwiches, by contrast, were prodigies: great slabs of tender, flavorful ham on fresh-baked bread, enlivened by spicy mustard and pickles all but jumping with dill and garlic and something else, something earthy—an At-lantean spice?</p>
   <p>Audubon hadn't come close to finishing his —he had to chew slowly—when the man behind the bar said, "Don't see too many strangers here." Several locals—big, stocky, bearded fellows in homespun —nodded. So did Audubon, politely. The tap-man went on, "Mind if I ask what you're doing passing through?"</p>
   <p>"I am John James Audubon," Audubon said, and waited to see if anyone knew his name. Most places, he would have had no doubt. In Bideford… well, who could say?</p>
   <p>"The painter fella," one of the regulars said.</p>
   <p>"That's right." Audubon smiled, more relieved than he wanted to show. "The painter fella." He repeated the words even though they grated. If the locals understood he was a prominent person, they were less likely to rob him and Harris for the fun of it. He introduced his friend.</p>
   <p>"Well, what are you doing here in Bideford?" the proprietor asked again.</p>
   <p>"Passing through, as you said," Audubon replied. "I'm hoping to paint honkers." This country was almost isolated enough to give him hope of finding some here — not quite, but almost.</p>
   <p>"Honkers?" Two or three men said it as the same time. A heartbeat later, they all laughed. One said, "Ain't seen any of them big fowl round these parts since Hector was a pup."</p>
   <p>"That's right," someone else said. Solemn nods filled the saloon.</p>
   <p>"It's a shame, too," another man said. "My granddad used to say they was easy to kill, and right good eatin'. Lots of meat on 'em, too." That had to be <emphasis>why</emphasis> no honkers lived near Bideford these days, but the local seemed ignorant of cause and effect.</p>
   <p>"If you know of any place where they might dwell, I'd be pleased to pay for the information." Audubon tapped a pouch on his belt. Coins clinked sweetly. "You'd help my work, and you'd advance the cause of science."</p>
   <p>"Half now," the practical Harris added, "and half on the way back if we find what we're looking for. Maybe a bonus, too, if the tip's good enough."</p>
   <p>A <emphasis>nice ploy,</emphasis> Audubon thought. I <emphasis>have to remember that one.</emphasis> The locals put their heads together. One of the older men, his beard streaked with gray, spoke up: "Well, I don't know anything for sure, mind, but I was out hunting a few years back and ran into this fellow from Thetford." <emphasis>He</emphasis> knew where Thetford was, but Audubon didn't. A few questions established that it lay to the northeast. The Bideford man continued, "We got to gabbing, and he said he saw some a few years before that, off the other side of his town. Can't swear he wasn't lyin', mind, but he sounded like he knew what he was talking about."</p>
   <p>Harris looked a question towards Audubon. The artist nodded. Harris gave the Bideford man a silver eagle. "Let me have your name, sir," Harris said. "If the tip proves good, and if we don't pass this way again on our return journey, we <emphasis>will</emphasis> make good on the rest of the reward."</p>
   <p>"Much obliged, sir," the man said. "I'm Lehonti Kent." He carefully spelled it out for Harris, who wrote it down in one of his notebooks.</p>
   <p>"What can you tell me about the House of Universal Devotion?" Audubon asked.</p>
   <p>That got him more than he'd bargained for. Suddenly everyone, even the most standoffish locals, wanted to talk at once. He gathered that the church preached the innate divinity of every human being and the possibility of transcending mere mankind —as long as you followed the preachings of the man the locals called the Reverend, with a very audible capital R. <emphasis>Universal Devotion to the Reverend,</emphasis> he thought. It all seemed to him the rankest, blackest heresy, but the men of Bideford swore by it.</p>
   <p>"Plenty of Devotees" —another obvious capital letter—"in Thetford and other places like that," Lehonti Kent said. He plainly had only the vaguest idea of places more than a couple of days' travel from his home village.</p>
   <p>"Isn't that interesting?" Audubon said: one of the few phrases polite almost anywhere.</p>
   <p>Because the Bidefordites wanted to preach to them, he and Harris couldn't get away from the saloon for a couple of hours. "Well, well," Harris said as they rode away. "Wasn't that <emphasis>interesting?"</emphasis> He freighted the word with enough sarcasm to sink a ship twice the size of the <emphasis>Maid of Orleans.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Audubon's head was still spinning. The Reverend seemed to have invented a whole new prehistory for Atlantis and Terranova, one that had little to do with anything Audubon thought he'd learned. He wondered if he'd be able to keep it straight enough to get it down in his diary. The Devotees seemed nearly as superstitious to him as the wild red Terranovan tribes—and they should have known better, while the savages were honestly ignorant. Even so, he said, "If Lehonti—what a name! — Kent gave us a true lead, I don't mind the time we spent… too much."</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Thetford proved a bigger village than Bideford. It also boasted a House of Universal Devotion, though it had a Methodist church as well. A crudely painted sign in front of the House said, THE REVEREND PREACHES SUNDAY!! Two exclamation points would have warned Audubon away even if he'd never passed through Bideford.</p>
   <p>He did ask after honkers in Thetford. No one with whom he talked claimed to have seen one, but a couple of men did say some people from the town had seen them once upon a time. Harris doled out more silver, but it spurred neither memory nor imagination.</p>
   <p>"Well, we would have come this way anyhow," Audubon said as they went on riding northeast. The Green Ridge Mountains climbed higher in the sky now, dominating the eastern horizon. Peering ahead with a spyglass, Audubon saw countless dark valleys half hidden by the pines and cycads that gave the mountains their name. Anything could live there… couldn't it? He had to believe it could. "We have a little more hope now," he added, as much to himself as to Harris.</p>
   <p>"Hope is good," his friend said. "Honkers would be better."</p>
   <p>The words were hardly out of his mouth before the ferns and cycads by the side of the road quivered… and a stag bounded across. Audubon started to raise his shotgun, but stopped with the motion not even well begun. For one thing, the beast was gone. For another, the gun was charged with bird-shot, which would only have stung it.</p>
   <p><emphasis>"Sic transit gloria honkeris."</emphasis> Harris said.</p>
   <p><emphasis>"Honkeris?"</emphasis> But Audubon held up a hand before Harris could speak. "Yes, <emphasis>honker</emphasis> would be a third-declension noun, wouldn't it?"</p>
   <p>Little by little, the country rose toward the mountains. Cycads thinned out in the woods; more varieties of pines and spruces and redwoods took their places. The ferns in the undergrowth seemed different, too. As settlements thinned out, so did splashes of color from exotic flowers. The very air seemed different: mistier, moister, full of curious, spicy scents the nose would not meet anywhere else in the world. It felt as if the smells of another time were wafting past the travelers.</p>
   <p>"And so they are," Audubon said when that thought crossed his mind. "This is the air of Atlantis as it was, Atlantis before those fishermen saw its coast loom up out of the sea."</p>
   <p>"Well, almost," Harris said. That he and Audubon and their horses were here proved his point. In case it didn't, he pointed to the track down which they rode. The ground was damp —muddy in spots —for it had rained the day before. A fox's pads showed plainly.</p>
   <p>"How many birds has that beast eaten?" Audubon said. "How many ground-dwellers' nests has it robbed?" Many Atlantean birds nested on the ground, far more than in either Europe or Terranova. But for a few snakes and large lizards, there were no terrestrial predators —or hadn't been, before men brought them in. Audubon made another note in his diary. Till now, he hadn't thought about the effect the presence or absence of predators might have on birds' nesting habits.</p>
   <p>Even here, in the sparsely settled heart of Atlantis, a great deal had been lost. But much still remained. Birdsongs filled the air, especially just after sunrise when Audubon and Harris started out each day. Atlantis had several species of crossbills and grosbeaks: birds with bills that seemed made for getting seeds out of cones and disposing of them afterwards. As with so many birds on the island, they were closely related to Terranovan forms, but not identical to them.</p>
   <p>Audubon shot a male green grosbeak in full breeding plumage. Lying in his hand, the bird, with its apple-green back, warm cinnamon belly, and yellow eye streak, seemed gaudy as a seventeenth-century French courtier. But on the branch of a redwood, against the green foliage and rusty-brown bark, it hadn't been easy to spot. If it weren't singing so insistently, chances were he would have ridden right past it.</p>
   <p>At dusk, Harris shot an oil thrush. That wasn't for research, though Audubon did save the skin. The long-billed flightless thrush had more than enough meat for both of them. The flavor put Audubon in mind of snipe or woodcock: not surprising, perhaps, when all three were so fond of earthworms.</p>
   <p>Gnawing on a thighbone, Harris said, "I wonder how long these birds will last."</p>
   <p>"Longer than honkers, anyhow, because they're less conspicuous," Audubon said, and his friend nodded. He went on, "But you have reason—they're in danger. They're one more kind that nests on the ground, and how can they escape foxes and dogs that hunt by scent?"</p>
   <p>Somewhere off in the distance, far beyond the light of the campfire, a fox yelped and yowled. Harris nodded. "There's a noise that wasn't heard here before the English brought them."</p>
   <p>"If it weren't foxes, it would be dogs," Audubon said sadly, and Harris' head bobbed up and down once more. Atlantis was vulnerable to man and his creatures, and that was the long and short of it. "A pity. A great pity," Audubon murmured. Harris nodded yet again.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The screech ripped across the morning air. Audubon's horse snorted and tried to rear. He calmed it with hands and voice and educated thighs. "Good God!" Harris said. "What was that?"</p>
   <p>Before answering, Audubon listened to the sudden and absolute silence all around. A moment before, the birds were singing their hearts out. As a lion's roar was said to bring stillness to the African plains, so this screech froze the forests of Atlantis.</p>
   <p>It rang out again, wild and harsh and fierce. Excitement tingled through Audubon. "I know what it is!" Despite the urgency in his voice, it hardly rose above a whisper. His gaze swung to the shotgun. <emphasis>Have to charge it with stronger shot,</emphasis> he thought.</p>
   <p>"What?" Harris also whispered, hoarsely. As after a lion's roar, talking out loud seemed dangerous.</p>
   <p>"A red-crested eagle, by all the saints!" Audubon said. "A <emphasis>rara avis</emphasis> itself, and also, with luck, a sign honkers aren't far away." Maybe the Atlantean national bird was reduced to hunting sheep or deer, but Audubon hadn't seen any close by. If the eagle still sought the prey it had always chosen before the coming of man… Oh, if it did!</p>
   <p>Harris didn't just look at his shotgun. He reached for it and methodically began to load. After a moment, so did Audubon. Red-crested eagles didn't fear men. They were used to swooping down on tall creatures that walked on two legs. People could die — people had died — under their great, tearing claws, long as a big man's thumb. Nor were their fierce beaks to be despised —anything but.</p>
   <p>"Where did the cry come from?" Audubon asked after loading both barrels.</p>
   <p>"That way." Harris pointed north. "Not far, either."</p>
   <p>"No, not far at all," Audubon agreed. "We have to find it. We <emphasis>have</emphasis> to, Edward!"</p>
   <p>He plunged into the undergrowth, moving quiet as he could. Harris hurried after him. They both carried their shotguns at high port, ready to fire and ready to try to fend off the eagle if it struck before they could.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Call again.</emphasis> Audubon willed the thought toward the red-crested eagle with all his strength. <emphasis>Call again. Show us where you are.</emphasis></p>
   <p>And the eagle did. The smaller birds had begun to sing again. Silence came down on them like a heavy boot. Audubon grew acutely aware of how loud his own footfalls were. He tried to stride more lightly, with what success he had trouble judging. Tracking the cry, he swung to the west just a little.</p>
   <p>"There!" Harris breathed behind him. His friend pointed and froze, for all the world like a well-bred, well-trained hunting dog.</p>
   <p>Audubon's eyes darted this way and that. He did not see… He did not see… And then he did. "Oh," he whispered: more a soft sound of wonder than a word.</p>
   <p>The eagle perched near the top of a ginkgo tree. It was a big female, close to four feet long from the end of its low, long bill to the tip of the tail. The crest was up, showing the bird was alert and in good spirits. It was the coppery red of a redheaded man's hair or a red-tailed hawk's tail, not the glowing crimson of a hummingbird's gorget. The eagle's back was dark brown, its belly a tawny buff.</p>
   <p>Slowly, carefully, Audubon and Harris drew closer. For all their caution, the bird saw them. It mantled on its perch, spreading its wings and screeching again. The span was relatively small for the eagle's size —not much more than seven feet—but the wings were very broad. Red-crested eagles flapped more than they soared, unlike their white-headed and golden cousins. Naturalists disagreed about which were their closer kin.</p>
   <p>"Watch out," Harris whispered. "It's going to fly."</p>
   <p>And it did, not three heartbeats after the words left his mouth. Audubon and Harris both swung up their guns and fired at essentially the same instant. The eagle cried out once more, this time a startled squall of pain and fear. It fell out of the sky and hit the ground with a thump.</p>
   <p>"Got it!" Harris exulted.</p>
   <p>"Yes." Joy and sorrow warred in Audubon. That magnificent creature —a shame it had to perish for the sake of art and science. How many were left to carry on the race? One fewer, whatever the answer was.</p>
   <p>This one wasn't dead yet. It thrashed in the ferns, screaming in fury because it couldn't fly. Its legs were long and strong—could it run? Audubon trotted towards it. <emphasis>It mustn't get away,</emphasis> he thought. Now that he and Harris had shot it, it had to become a specimen and a subject for his art. If it didn't, they would have knocked it down for nothing, and he couldn't bear the idea.</p>
   <p>The red-crested eagle wasn't running. When he came close enough, he saw that a shotgun ball from one of the two charges had broken its left leg. The bird screeched and snapped at him; he had to jump back in a hurry to keep that fearsome beak from carving a chunk out of his calf. Hate and rage blazed in those great golden eyes.</p>
   <p>Along with the shotgun, Harris also carried his revolver. He drew it now, and aimed it at the bird. "I'll finish it," he said. "Put it out of its misery." He thumbed back the hammer.</p>
   <p>"In the breast, if you please," Audubon said. "I don't want to spoil the head."</p>
   <p>"At your service, John. If the poor creature will only hold still for a few seconds…"</p>
   <p>After more frantic thrashing and another long-neck lunge at the men who'd reduced it from lord of the air to wounded victim, the eagle paused to pant and to gather its waning strength. Harris fired. A pistol ball would have blown a songbird to pieces, but the eagle was big enough to absorb the bullet. It let out a final bubbling scream before slumping over, dead.</p>
   <p>"That is one splendid creature," Harris said solemnly. "No wonder the Atlanteans put it on their flag and on their money."</p>
   <p>"No wonder at all," Audubon said. He waited a few minutes, lest the eagle, like a serpent, have one more bite in it. Even then, he nudged the bird with a stick before picking it up. That beak, and the talons on the unwounded leg, commanded respect. He grunted in surprise as he straightened with the still-warm body in his arms. "How much would you say this bird weighs, Edward?"</p>
   <p>"Let me see." Harris held out his arms. Audubon put the red-crested eagle in them. Harris grunted, too. He hefted the eagle, his lips pursed thoughtfully. "Dog my cats if it doesn't go thirty pounds, easy. You wouldn't think such a big bird'd be able to get off the ground, would you?"</p>
   <p>"We saw it. Many have seen it," Audubon said. He took the eagle back from Harris and gauged its weight again himself. "Thirty pounds? Yes, that seems about right. I would have guessed something around there, too. Neither the golden nor the white-headed eagle goes much above twelve pounds, and even the largest African eagle will not greatly surpass twenty."</p>
   <p>"Those birds don't hunt honkers," Harris said. His usual blunt good sense got to the nub of the problem in a handful of words. "The red-crested, now, it needs all the muscles it can get."</p>
   <p>"No doubt you're right," Audubon said. "The biggest honkers, down in the eastern lowlands, would stand a foot, two feet, taller than a man and weigh… What do you suppose they would weigh?"</p>
   <p>"Three or four times as much as a man, maybe more," Harris said. "You look at those skeletons, you see right away they were lardbutted birds."</p>
   <p>Audubon wouldn't have put it that way, but he couldn't say his companion was wrong. "Can you imagine the red-crested eagle diving down to strike a great honker?" he said, excitement at the thought making his voice rise. "It would have been like Jove's lightning from the sky, nothing less."</p>
   <p>"Can you imagine trying to hold them off with pikes and matchlocks and bows, the way the first settlers did?" Harris said. "Better those fellows than me, by God! It's a wonder there were any second settlers after that."</p>
   <p>"No doubt that's so," Audubon said, but he was only half listening. He looked down at the red-crested eagle, already trying to decide how to pose it for what would, for all sorts of reasons, undoubtedly prove the last volume of <emphasis>Birds and Viviparous Quadrupeds of Northern Terranova and Atlantis.</emphasis> He wanted to show it in a posture that displayed its power and majesty, but the bird was simply too large even for the double elephant folios of his life's work.</p>
   <p><emphasis>What cant be cured…</emphasis> he thought, and carried the bird back to the patiently waiting horses. Yes, it surely weighed every ounce of thirty pounds; sweat streamed down his face by the time he got to them. The horses rolled their eyes. One of them let out a soft snort at the smell of blood.</p>
   <p>"There, there, my pets, my lovelies," he crooned, and gave each beast a bit of loaf sugar. That calmed them nicely; horses were as susceptible to bribery as people — and much less likely to go back on any bargain they made.</p>
   <p>He got to work with the posing board—which, though he'd brought the largest one he had, was almost too small for the purpose —and his wires. Watching him, Harris asked, "How will you pose a honker if we find one?"</p>
   <p><emphasis>"When</emphasis> we find one." Audubon would not admit the possibility of failure to his friend or to himself. "How? I'll do the best I can, of course, and I trust I will enjoy your excellent assistance?"</p>
   <p>"I'll do whatever you want me to. You know that," Harris said. "Would I be out here in the middle of nowhere if I wouldn't?"</p>
   <p>"No, certainly not." Again, though, Audubon gave the reply only half his attention. He knew what he wanted to do now. He shaped the red-crested eagle with wings pulled back and up to brake its flight, talons splayed wide, and beak agape as if it were about to descend on a great honker's back.</p>
   <p>He found a stick of charcoal and began to sketch. No sooner had the charcoal touched the paper than he knew this would be a good one, even a great one. Sometimes the hand would refuse to realize what the eye saw, what the brain thought, what the heart desired. Audubon always did the best he could, as he'd told Harris. Some days, that best was better than others. Today… today was one of those. He felt almost as if he stood outside himself, watching himself perform, watching <emphasis>something</emphasis> perform through him.</p>
   <p>When the drawing was done, he went on holding the charcoal stick, as if he didn't want to let it go. And he didn't. But he had nothing left to add. He'd done what he could do, and…</p>
   <p>"That's some of your best work in a long time, John —much better than the woodpecker, and that was mighty good," Harris said. "I didn't want to talk while you were at it, for fear I'd break the spell. But that one, when you paint it, will live forever. It will be less than life-sized on the page, then?"</p>
   <p>"Yes. It will have to be," Audubon said. When he spoke, it also felt like breaking the spell. But he made himself nod and respond as a man would in normal circumstances; you couldn't stay on that exalted plane forever. Even touching it now and again seemed a special gift from God. More words came: "This is <emphasis>right.</emphasis> If it's small, then it's small, that's all. Those who see will understand."</p>
   <p>"When they see the bird like that, they will." Harris seemed unable to tear his eyes away form the sketch.</p>
   <p>And Audubon descended to mundane reality, drawing ginkgoes and pines and ferns for the background of the painting yet to come. The work there was solid, professional draftsmanship; it seemed a million miles away from the inspiration that had fired him only minutes before.</p>
   <p>Once he finished all the sketches he needed, he skinned the eagle and dissected it. When he opened the bird's stomach, he found gobbets of half-digested, unusually dark flesh. It had a strong odor that put him in mind of… "Edward!" he said. "What does this smell like to you?"</p>
   <p>Harris stooped beside him and sniffed. He needed only a few seconds to find an answer, one very much in character.</p>
   <p>"Steak-and-kidney pie, by God!"</p>
   <p>And not only was the answer in character. It was also right, as Audubon recognized at once. "It does!" he exclaimed, though the homely dish wasn't one of his favorites. "And these bits of flesh have the look of kidney, too. And that means…"</p>
   <p>"What?" Harris asked.</p>
   <p>"From everything I've read, honker kidneys and the fat above them <emphasis>were—are —</emphasis> the red-crested eagle's favorite food!" Audubon answered. "If this bird has a belly full of chunks of kidney, then somewhere not far away, somewhere not far away at all, there must be —there <emphasis>must</emphasis> be, I say—honkers on which it fed."</p>
   <p>"Unless it killed a deer or some such," Harris said. In that moment, Audubon almost hated his friend —not because Harris was wrong, but because he might not be. And dropping a brute fact on Audubon's glittering tower of speculation seemed one of the crudest things any man could do.</p>
   <p>"Well," Audubon said, and then, bucking up, "Well," again. He gathered himself, gathered his stubbornness. "We just have to find out, don't we?"</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Two days later, two days deeper into the western foothills of the Green Ridge Mountains, Audubon's sense of smell again came to his aid. This time, he had no trouble identifying the odor a breeze sent his way. "Phew!" he said, wrinkling his nose. "Something's dead."</p>
   <p>"Sure is," Harris agreed. "Something big, too, by the stink."</p>
   <p>"Something big…" Audubon nodded, trying without much luck to control the electric jolt that coursed through him at those words. "Yes!"</p>
   <p>Harris raised an eyebrow. "Yes, indeed. And so?"</p>
   <p>"There aren't many big creatures in Atlantis," Audubon said. "It could be a dead man, though I hope not. It could be a dead deer or horse or cow, perhaps. Or it could be… Edward, it could be…"</p>
   <p>"A dead honker?" Harris spoke the word when Audubon couldn't make himself bring it past the barrier of his teeth, past the barrier of his hopes, and out into the open air where it might wither and perish.</p>
   <p>"Yes!" he said again, even more explosively than before.</p>
   <p>"Well, then, we'd better rein in, hadn't we, and see if we can find out?" Harris let out a creaky chuckle. "Never thought I'd turn bloodhound in my old age. Only goes to show you can't tell, doesn't it?"</p>
   <p>He and Audubon tied their horses to a pine sapling by the side of the track. Audubon didn't worry about anyone coming along and stealing the animals; he just didn't want them wandering off. As far as he knew, he and his friend were the only people for miles around. This region was settled thinly, if at all. The two men plunged into the woods, both of them carrying shotguns.</p>
   <p>A bloodhound would have run straight to the mass of corruption. Audubon and Harris had no such luck. Tracking by sight or by ear, Audubon would easily have been able to find his quarry. Trying to track by scent, he discovered at once that he was no bloodhound, and neither was Harris. They cast back and forth, trying to decide whether the stench was stronger here or there, in this direction or that: a slow, nasty, frustrating business.</p>
   <p>And then, from the edge of a meadow, Harris called, "John! Come quick! I've found it!"</p>
   <p><emphasis>"Mon Dieu!"</emphasis> Audubon crashed toward him, his heart thumping and thudding in his chest. "Is it, Edward?" he asked. "Is it a — "</p>
   <p>"See for yourself." Harris pointed out to the curved lump of meat that lay in the middle of the grass and weeds.</p>
   <p>"Mon <emphasis>Dieu,"</emphasis> Audubon said again, softly this time, and crossed himself. "It is a dead honker. It is. And where there are dead ones, there must be live ones as well."</p>
   <p>"Stands to reason," Harris said, "unless this one here is the very last of its kind."</p>
   <p>"Bite your tongue, you horrible man. Fate wouldn't be so cruel to me." Audubon hoped—prayed—he was right. He walked out to the huge dead bird.</p>
   <p>If any large scavengers had been at the corpse, Harris —or Audubon's noisy passage through the woods —had scared them off. Clouds of flies still buzzed above it, though, while ants and beetles took their share of the odorous bounty. Audubon stood upwind, which helped some, but only so much.</p>
   <p>This wasn't one of the truly enormous honkers that had wandered the eastern plains before men found Atlantis. It was an upland species, and probably hadn't been as tall as Audubon or weighed much more than twice as much as he did. A great wound in the center of its back—now boiling with maggots —told how it died. That was surely a blow from a red-crested eagle: perhaps the one Audubon and Harris shot, perhaps another.</p>
   <p>"Can you draw from this one?" Harris asked.</p>
   <p>Regretfully, Audubon shook his head. "I fear not. It's too far gone." His sensitive stomach heaved. Even with the ground firm under his feet, the stench nauseated him.</p>
   <p>"I was afraid you'd say that," Harris said. "Shall we take specimens—bones and feathers and such —so we have <emphasis>something</emphasis> to bring back in case we don't run into any live honkers?"</p>
   <p>Messing about with the dead, reeking bird was the last thing Audubon wanted to do. "We <emphasis>will</emphasis> find live ones," he said. Harris didn't answer. He just stolidly stood there and let Audubon listen to himself and know he couldn't be certain he was right. The artist glared at him. "But I suppose we should preserve what specimens we can, in the interest of science."</p>
   <p>Pulling feathers from the honker wasn't too bad. The black ones on its neck and the white patch under the chin testified to its affinity to Canada geese. The feathers on the body, though, were long and shaggy, more hairlike than similar to the plumage of birds gifted with flight.</p>
   <p>Getting the meat from the bones and then cleaning them… Audubon's poor stomach couldn't stand the strain. He lost his breakfast on the green meadow grass and then dry-heaved helplessly for a while. A little rill ran through the meadow not far away. Perhaps the honker was going out to drink there when the eagle struck.</p>
   <p>Audubon rinsed his mouth with cold, clear water from the rill… upstream from where Harris washed rotting flesh from the honker's right femur. The thighbone was larger and stouter than his own. Gathering himself, Audubon went back to the corpse to free the bird's pelvis. He brought it back to the rill to clean it. How long would his hands reek of decay? How long would his clothes? Would he ever be able to wear this outfit again? He doubted it. As he worked, he tried not to look at what he was doing.</p>
   <p>His hands, then, told him of something odd: a hole in the bone on the left side of the pelvis that wasn't matched on the right. That did make him look. Sure enough, the hole was there, and a shallow groove leading to it. "See what I have here," he said to Harris.</p>
   <p>His friend examined it, then asked, "What do you make of that?"</p>
   <p>"Don't you think it comes from the claw of the red-crested eagle?" Audubon said. "You saw the talons on the bird. One could pierce the flesh above the bone, and then the bone itself. This is plainly a very recent wound: notice how rough the bone is all around the edge. It had no chance to heal."</p>
   <p>After considering, Harris nodded. "I'd say you're right. I'd say you have to be right. You might almost have seen the eagle flying at the honker."</p>
   <p>"I wish I would have!" Audubon held up the still-stinking pelvis. "I'll have to draw this. It holds too much information to be easily described in words."</p>
   <p>"Let Mr. Owen look to his laurels, then," Harris said.</p>
   <p>"I'll do the best I can, that's all," Audubon said. The detailed scientific illustration would have to be pen and ink, not charcoal or watercolor. It would also have to be unrelentingly precise. He couldn't pose the pelvis, except to show the perforation to best advantage, and he couldn't alter and adjust to make things more dramatic. His particular gift lay in portraying motion and emotion; he would have to eschew them both here. He clicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth. "An artist should be versatile, eh?"</p>
   <p>"I know you can do it." Harris showed more confidence in him than he had in himself.</p>
   <p>The smell of rotting honker came closer to spooking the horses than the eagle's blood had a couple of days before. The pack horse that carried Audubon's artistic supplies didn't want to let him anywhere near it. It didn't even want sugar from his stinking hand. He counted himself lucky to take what he needed without getting kicked.</p>
   <p>He set the honker hipbone in the sun, then started sketching with a pencil. He tried and rubbed out, tried and rubbed out. Sweat ran down his face, though the day was fine and mild. This was ever so much harder—for him, anyway—than painting would have been. It seemed like forever before what he set down on paper bore any resemblance to the specimen that was its model.</p>
   <p>When he was finally satisfied, he held up the sketch to show it to Harris, only to discover his friend had gone off somewhere and he'd never noticed. Painting took far less concentration. It left room for artistry. This… this was a craft, and one in which he knew himself to be imperfectly skilled.</p>
   <p>He'd just inked his pen for the first time when Harris' shotgun boomed. Would that be supper or another specimen? <emphasis>I'll find out,</emphasis> Audubon thought, and set about turning his shades of gray into black and white. He had to turn the pelvis to compensate for the way shadows had shifted with the moving sun while he worked.</p>
   <p>Harris fired again. Audubon heard the blast, but didn't consciously register it. His hand never twitched. A fine line here, shading there to show a hollow, the exact look of the gouge the eagle's claw had dug before piercing the pelvis where the bone thinned…</p>
   <p>"We've got supper," Harris said. Audubon nodded to show he heard. Harris went on, "And here's something for you to work on when you're done there."</p>
   <p>That made Audubon look up. Along with a plump oil thrush, Harris carried a small, grayish, pale-bellied bird with a black cap. "An Atlantean tit!" Audubon said. The bird was closely allied to the tits of England and Europe and to Terranovan chickadees. Naturalists disagreed about which group held its nearest kin. At the moment, though, he was just glad he would be able to sketch and paint; to feel; to let imprecision be a virtue, not a sin. "Yes, that will be a change —and a relief."</p>
   <p>"How's the drawing coming?" Harris asked. Audubon showed him. Harris looked from the paper to the pelvis and back again. After a moment, he silently lifted his broad-brimmed felt hat from his head, a salute Audubon cherished more than most wordier ones.</p>
   <p>"Bones are all very well," the artist said, "but I want the chance to draw honkers from life!"</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Audubon began to despair of getting what he wanted. He began to believe Harris' gibe was right, and he'd come along just in time to find the last honker in the world moldering in the meadow. Could fate be so cruel?</p>
   <p>Whenever he started to fret, Harris would say, "Well, we've got something, anyway. We didn't know for sure we'd get anything at all when we set out." Every word of that was true, and it always made Audubon feel worse, not better.</p>
   <p>He spent several days haunting the meadow where his friend found the dead honker, hoping it was part of a flock or a gaggle or whatever the English word for a group of honkers was. No others showed up, though. He found no fresh tracks in the mud by the rill. At last, sorrowfully, he decided the dead bird must have been alone.</p>
   <p>"What if it <emphasis>was</emphasis> the last one?" he said. "To miss it by a few days… Why couldn't we have shot the eagle sooner? Then the honker would still be alive!"</p>
   <p>He waited for Harris to be grateful again for what they had. But Harris surprised him, saying, "No use worrying about it. We don't <emphasis>know</emphasis> that eagle got that honker, anyhow."</p>
   <p>"Well, no," Audubon admitted upon reflection. "Maybe it was some other villainous eagle instead." He got most affronted when Harris laughed at him.</p>
   <p>Even though he was forced to admit to himself that honkers weren't going to visit the meadow, he was loath to leave it. He knew at least one live bird had frequented it up until mere days before. About what other spot in all Atlantis —in all the world —could he say the same?</p>
   <p>He kept looking back over his shoulder long after he and Harris rode away. "Don't worry," said Harris, the optimist born. "Bound to be better land ahead."</p>
   <p>"How do you know that?" Audubon demanded.</p>
   <p>Harris surprised him by having an answer: "Because as best I can tell, nobody's ever come this way before. We're on a track now, not a road. I haven't seen any hoof-prints besides the ones our horses are leaving for a couple of hours now."</p>
   <p>Audubon blinked. He looked around—<emphasis>really</emphasis> looked around. <emphasis>"Nom d'un nom!"</emphasis> he murmured. "So it would seem." Pines and cycads and ginkgoes crowded close together on either side of the track. The air was fragrant with scents whose like he would find nowhere else. "This might almost be the antediluvian age, or another world altogether. What do you suppose made our trail?"</p>
   <p>"Anywhere else, I'd say deer. That may be so here, too, but I haven't seen any sign of them —no tracks, no droppings," Harris said. "Oil thrushes? Some of the other big flightless birds they have here? Maybe even honkers—who knows?"</p>
   <p>That was enough to make Audubon dismount and minutely examine the surface of the trail in the hope of finding honker tracks. With their size and with the vestigial webbing between their toes, they were unmistakable. He found none. He did see oil-thrush footprints, as Harris had suggested: they reminded him of those of the European blackbird or Terranovan robin, except for being three or four times as large. And he saw a fox's pads, which stood out against the spiky background of bird tracks. Imported creatures penetrated even here, to the wild heart of Atlantis.</p>
   <p><emphasis>But of course,</emphasis> he thought. <emphasis>Harris and I are here, aren't we? And we're no less fond of an oil-thrush supper than foxes are.</emphasis></p>
   <p>A splash of vivid green on the side of a redwood sapling caught his eye as he rode past. At first, he thought it was some strange Atlantean fungus clinging to the trunk. Then, ever so slowly, it moved. "A cucumber slug!" Harris exclaimed.</p>
   <p>The slug was almost the size of a cucumber, though Audubon would have fought shy of eating anything of that iridescent hue. Though it was neither bird nor viviparous quadruped, he stopped and sketched it. It was a curiosity, and one little known to naturalists— few of them penetrated to the cool, humid uplands where it lived. Eye-stalks waving, it glided along the trunk, leaving behind a thumb-wide trail of slime.</p>
   <p>"Maybe we'll come across some of those snails that are almost as big as your fist, too," Harris said.</p>
   <p>"A shame to do it now, when we have no garlic butter." Audubon might draw the line at a cucumber slug, but he was fond of <emphasis>escargots.</emphasis> Harris, a Terranovan born and bred, made a horrible face. Audubon only laughed.</p>
   <p>They rode on. The tracks they followed were never made by man. They twisted this way and that and doubled back on themselves again and again. Whenever Audubon came out into the open, he scanned the stretch of grass ahead with eager hope. How he longed to see honkers grazing there, or pulling leaves from tender young trees! How disappointed he was, again and again!</p>
   <p>"Maybe that <emphasis>was</emphasis> the last honker in this part of Atlantis," he mourned as he and Harris made camp one night. "Maybe it was the last honker in all of Atlantis."</p>
   <p>"Maybe it was," his friend replied. Audubon, toasting an oil-thrush drumstick over the flames, glared at him. The least Harris could do was sympathize. But then he continued, "We've come too far and we've done too much to give up so soon, haven't we?"</p>
   <p>"Yes," Audubon said. "Oh, yes."</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>As the scents were different in this mostly pristine Atlantean wilderness, so too were the sounds. Enormous frogs boomed out their calls an octave lower than even Ter-ranovan bullfrogs, let alone the smaller frogs of Europe. When Audubon remarked on them, Harris said, "I suppose you're sorry about the garlic butter there, too."</p>
   <p>"Why, yes, now that you mention it," the painter said placidly. His friend screwed up his face again.</p>
   <p>The big green katydids that might almost have been mice were noisier than rodents would have been, though some of their squeaks sounded eerily mouse-like. But most of their chirps and trills showed them to be insects after all. Their calls made up the background noise, more notable when it suddenly ceased than when it went on.</p>
   <p>Audubon heard birdsongs he'd never imagined. Surely some of those singers were as yet nondescript, new to science. If he could shoot one, sketch it and paint it, bring back a type specimen… He did shoot several warblers and finches, but all, so far as he knew, from species already recognized.</p>
   <p>Then he heard the scream of a red-crested eagle somewhere far off to the north. He reined in and pointed in that direction. "We go there," he declared, in tones that brooked no argument.</p>
   <p>Harris argued anyhow: "It's miles away, John. We can't hope to find just where it is, and by the time we get there it'll be somewhere else anyhow."</p>
   <p>"We go north," Audubon said, as if his friend hadn't spoken. "The eagle may fly away, but if honkers are nearby they won't. They can't."</p>
   <p>"If." Edward Harris packed a world of doubt into one small word.</p>
   <p>"You said it yourself: we've come too far and done too much to give up hope." If that wasn't precisely what Harris had said, Audubon preferred not to be reminded of it. Harris had the sense to recognize as much.</p>
   <p>Going north proved no easier than going in any other cardinal direction. Audubon swore in English; French, and occasionally Spanish when game tracks swerved and led him astray. The red-crested eagle had fallen silent after that one series of screeches, so it told him nothing about how much farther he needed to come. <emphasis>Maybe it's killed again. Maybe it's feasting,</emphasis> he thought. Even a freshly dead honker might do.</p>
   <p>He and Harris came to a stream like a young river. Those Goliath frogs croaked from the rocks. "Can we ford it?" Audubon asked.</p>
   <p>"We'd better look for a shallow stretch," the ever-sensible Harris said.</p>
   <p>They found one half a mile to the west, and forded the stream without getting the horses' bellies wet. He unfolded a map of northern Atlantis. "Which stream do you suppose this is?" he said. "It should be big enough to show up here."</p>
   <p>Harris put on reading glasses to peer at the map. "If it was ever surveyed at all," he said, and pointed. "It might be a tributary of the Spey. That's about where we are."</p>
   <p>"I would have guessed it flows into the Liffey myself." Audubon pointed, too.</p>
   <p>"Next one farther north? Well, maybe," Harris said. "The way we've been wandering lately, we could be damn near anywhere. Shall we go on?" Without waiting for an answer, he urged his horse forward. Audubon got his mount moving, too.</p>
   <p>Not long after the murmur of the stream and the frogs' formidable calls—what Aristophanes would have done with them!—faded in the distance, Audubon heard what he first thought were geese flying by. He'd ridden out onto a grassy stretch a little while before. He looked north to see if he could spot the birds, but had no luck.</p>
   <p>Harris was peering in the same direction, his face puzzled. "Geese—but not quite geese," he said. "Sounds like trumpet music played on a slide trombone."</p>
   <p>"It does!" For a moment, Audubon simply smiled at the comparison. Then, sudden wild surmise in his eye, he stared at his friend. "Edward, you don't suppose — ?"</p>
   <p>"I don't know," Harris said, "but we'd better find out. If they aren't honkers, they could be nondescript geese, which wouldn't be bad, either. Audubon's geese, you could call them."</p>
   <p>"I could," said Audubon, who'd never had less interest in discovering a new species. "I could, yes, but… I'm going to load my gun with buckshot." He started doing just that.</p>
   <p>"Good plan." So did Harris.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Keep calling. Please keep calling,</emphasis> Audubon thought, again and again, as they rode through the forest toward the sound. The birds—whatever they were —did keep up the noise, now quietly, now rising to an angry peak as if a couple of males were quarreling over a female, as males were likely to do in spring.</p>
   <p>When Audubon thought they'd come close enough, he slid down off his horse, saying, "We'd best go forward on foot now." He carried not only his gun but also charcoal sticks and paper, in case… Harris also dismounted. Audubon believed he would have brained him with the shotgun had he argued.</p>
   <p>After perhaps ten minutes, Harris pointed ahead. "Look. We're coming to an open space." Audubon nodded, not trusting himself to speak. He too saw the bright sunshine that told of a break in the trees. The bird calls were very loud now, very near. "Would you call that honking?" Harris asked. Audubon only shrugged and slid forward.</p>
   <p>He peered out from in back of a cycad at the meadow beyond… at the meadow, and at the honkers grazing on it. Then they blurred: tears of joy ran down his face.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>"Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who hast preserved me alive to see such things," he whispered, staring and staring.</p>
   <p>Harris stood behind a small spruce a few feet away. "Isn't that something. Isn't that <emphasis>something?"</emphasis> he said, his words more prosaic than his friend's, but his tone hardly less reverent.</p>
   <p>Eight honkers grazed there, pulling up grass with their bills: two males, Audubon judged, and half a dozen smaller females. The birds had a more forward-leaning posture than did the mounted skeletons in the Hanover museum. That meant they weren't so tall. The males probably could stretch their heads up higher than a man, but it wouldn't be easy or comfortable for them.</p>
   <p>And then they both moved toward the same female, and did stretch their necks up and up and up, and honked as loudly as ever they could, and flapped their tiny, useless wings to make themselves seem big and fierce. And, while they squabbled, the female walked away.</p>
   <p>Audubon started sketching. He didn't know how many of the sketches he would work up into paintings and how many would become woodcuts or lithographs. He didn't care, either. He was sketching honkers from life, and if that wasn't heaven it was the next best thing.</p>
   <p>"Which species are they, do you suppose?" Harris asked.</p>
   <p>Once, at least a dozen varieties of honker had roamed Atlantis' plains and uplands. The largest couple of species, the so-called great honkers, birds of the easily accessible eastern lowlands, went extinct first. Audubon had studied the remains in Hanover and elsewhere to be ready for this day. Now it was here, and he still found himself unsure. "I… believe they're what's called the agile honker," he said slowly. "Those are the specimens they most resemble."</p>
   <p>"If you say they're agile honkers, why then, they are," Harris said. "Anyone who thinks otherwise will have to change his mind, because you've got the creatures."</p>
   <p>"I want to be right." But Audubon couldn't deny his friend had a point. "A shame to have to take a specimen, but…"</p>
   <p>"It'll feed us for a while, too." The prospect didn't bother Harris. "They <emphasis>are</emphasis> supposed to be good eating."</p>
   <p>"True enough." When Audubon had all the sketches he wanted of grazing honkers and of bad-tempered males displaying, he stepped out from behind the cy-cad. The birds stared at him in mild surprise. Then they walked away. He was something strange, but they didn't think he was particularly dangerous. Atlantean creatures had no innate fear of man. The lack cost them dearly.</p>
   <p>He walked after them, and they withdrew again. Harris came out, too, which likely didn't help. Audubon held up a hand. "Stay there, Edward. I'll lure them back."</p>
   <p>Setting down his shotgun, he lay on his back in the sweet-smelling grass, raised his hips, and pumped his legs in the air, first one, then the other, again and again, faster and faster. He'd made pronghorn antelope on the Terranovan prairie curious enough to approach with that trick. What worked with the wary antelope should work for agile honkers as well. "Are they coming?" he asked.</p>
   <p>"They sure are." Harris chuckled. "You look like a damn fool—you know that?"</p>
   <p>"So what?" Audubon went on pumping. Yes, he could hear the honkers drawing near, hear their calls and then hear their big, four-toed feet tramping through the grass.</p>
   <p>When he stood up again, he found the bigger male only a few feet away. The honker squalled at him; it didn't care for anything on two legs that was taller than it. "Going to shoot that one?" Harris asked.</p>
   <p>"Yes. Be ready if my charge doesn't bring it down," Audubon said. Point-blank buckshot should do the job. Sometimes, though, wild creatures were amazingly tenacious of life.</p>
   <p>Audubon raised the shotgun. No, the agile honker had no idea what it was. This hardly seemed sporting, but his art and science both required it. He pulled the trigger. The gun kicked against his shoulder. The male let out a last surprised honk and toppled. The rest of the birds ran off—faster than a man, probably as fast as a horse, gabbling as they went.</p>
   <p>Harris came up beside Audubon. "He's down. He won't get up again, either."</p>
   <p>"No." Audubon wasn't proud of what he'd done. "And the other male can have all the females now."</p>
   <p>"He ought to thank you, eh?" Harris leered and poked Audubon in the ribs.</p>
   <p>"He'd best enjoy them while he can." Audubon stayed somber. "Sooner or later—probably sooner—someone else will come along and shoot him, too, and his lady friends with him."</p>
   <p>By then, the rest of the honkers had gone perhaps a hundred yards. When no more unexpected thunder boomed, they settled down and started grazing again. A few minutes later, a hawk soared by overhead—not a red-crested eagle, but an ordinary hawk far too small to harm them: Still, its shadow panicked them more thoroughly than the shotgun blast had. They sprinted for the cover of the trees, honking louder than they did when Audubon fired.</p>
   <p>"Would you please bring my wires, Edward?" the artist asked. "No posing board with a bird this size, but I can truss him up into lifelike postures."</p>
   <p>"I'll be back directly," Harris said. He took longer than he promised, but only because instead of carrying things himself he led up the pack horses. That gave Audubon not only the wires but also his watercolors and the strong spirits for preserving bits of the agile honker. If he and Harris did what he'd told the customs man they wouldn't do and drank some of the spirits instead of using them all as preservatives… Well, how else could they celebrate?</p>
   <p>Audubon soon got to work. "This may be the last painting I ever do," he said. "If it is, I want to give my best."</p>
   <p>"Don't be foolish. You're good for another twenty years, easy," Harris said.</p>
   <p>"I hope you're right." Audubon left it there. No matter what he hoped, he didn't believe it, however much he wished he did. He went on, "And this may be the last view of these honkers science ever gets. I owe it to them to give my best, too."</p>
   <p>He wired the dead male's neck and wings into the pose it took when challenging its rival. He had the sketches he'd made from life to help him do that. His heart pounded as he and Harris manhandled the honker. Ten years earlier, or even five, it wouldn't have seemed so hard. No, he didn't think he had twenty more left, or anything close to that.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Live for the moment then,</emphasis> he told himself. <emphasis>It's all there is.</emphasis> His eye still saw; his hand still obeyed. If the rest of him was wearing out like a steamboat that had gone up and down the Big Muddy too many times… then it was. When people remembered him, it would be for what his eye saw and his hand did. The rest? The rest mattered only to him.</p>
   <p>And when people remembered agile honkers from now on, that too would be for what <emphasis>his</emphasis> eye saw and what <emphasis>his</emphasis> hand did. Even more than he had with the red-crested eagle, he felt responsibility's weight heavy on his shoulders.</p>
   <p>The other honkers came out from the trees and began grazing again. Some of them drew close to where he worked. Their calls when they saw him by the male's body seemed to his ear curious and plaintive. They knew their fellow was dead, but they couldn't understand why Audubon stood near the corpse. Unlike a hawk's shadow, he was no danger they recognized.</p>
   <p>The Sun was setting when he looked up from his work. "I think it may do," he said. "The background will wait for later."</p>
   <p>Harris examined the honker on the paper, the honker vibrant with the life Audubon had stolen from its model. He set a hand on the painter's shoulder. "Congratulations. This one will last forever."</p>
   <p>"Which is more than I will. Which is more than the birds will." Audubon looked down at the dead honker, agile no more. "Now for the anatomical specimens, and now for the dark meat. Poor thing, it will be all flyblown by this time tomorrow."</p>
