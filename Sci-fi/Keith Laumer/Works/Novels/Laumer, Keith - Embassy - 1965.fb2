    <p>Prologue</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>On my first morning I came down early into the lobby of the Grand Samoy Hotel, a dim cavern half the size of Victoria Station and about the same age, filled with shadows and grime and strange odors and tarnished gilt and the memories of empire. The wooden-bladed fans turning under the high gingerbread ceilings provided a rhythmic creaking but no breeze, and through the open doors the hot white light glared in off the pavement like a threat.</p>
   <p>Behind the black-varnished mahogany reception desk, a small neat man with nervous eyes in a lined brown face peered at me over gold rimmed glasses as I came up and asked for directions.</p>
   <p>“American Embassy? Only five minutes from here, Mr. Bayard,” he said in a tone that suggested he was afraid I might argue the point.</p>
   <p>“Would that be by bus, train, or on foot?” I inquired genially.</p>
   <p>“No train running, Mr. Bayard.” Sweat appeared at his hair line and started down. He leaned over the counter and pointed outside. “But Tri-shaw waiting, sah! One kot only, come quickly-quickly to Embassy!”</p>
   <p>“Don‘t rush me,” I cautioned him. “I don‘t want to miss anything.”</p>
   <p>He gave me a stricken look and hurried away to attend a stout Indian gentleman lodging what sounded like a complaint in staccato Urdu; I went on across the unswept tiles and out into the smells and sounds of Samoy town.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>It wasn‘t quite seven o‘clock but the sun was already hot; I strolled along and looked at the people crowding along the street, the gaunt pi dogs, the sleek black crows that ducked down for choice bits from the gutter. A bristly sewer rat ambled along ahead for quite a distance before a man in a white shirt and flowered skirt pulled off a sandal and took a slap at him.</p>
   <p>There were wild flowers growing in mounds of dirt among tilted paving blocks where the street had been dug up a long time ago, and there were vendor‘s stalls and bamboo huts built on the curb and along the sidewalk. The facades that had probably been impressive once were stained green and grey with mould, where you could see them behind the huts and the hand-painted signs.</p>
   <p>I came along Daijee Street into Victoria Square, and there it was, a white building with a heavy marquee and a big American flag hanging down above it. A short wide Samoyan in a warped white garrison cap and a soiled white uniform with gold buttons was standing out front. He had a rolled umbrella hooked over one arm, and under the starched pants six inches of bowed leg showed above large bare feet.</p>
   <p>The folding steel grill in the entry was closed, and behind it a Marine Guard in civilian clothes lounged against the handrail. I was a little early, I saw, but the SAS office across the way seemed to be open, so I dropped the long skinny cigar I was smoking through a gap in the sidewalk, waited for the splash, and headed across the square.</p>
   <p>In the airline office a tall slender girl with a clean pretty face and short blonde hair gave me a nice smile as I came up to the counter. I told her about my baggage that hadn‘t turned up when the plane was unloaded the night before.</p>
   <p>“Any chance of running it down this side of Tokyo?” I wondered.</p>
   <p>“Yes, certainly. May I have your ticket and claim checks?”</p>
   <p>I gave her the papers and she looked at them in a businesslike way.</p>
   <p>“You are stopping here?” She sounded pleased, as though I had just told her I was famous.</p>
   <p>“I‘ll be working across the street.” I nodded toward the Embassy.</p>
   <p>“I‘ve been so eager to meet the American diplomats. I see them coming out every day and getting into their big American cars and driving away in such a hurry.”</p>
   <p>“I‘m eager to meet the American diplomats myself,” I said. “I‘m new at the job.”</p>
   <p>The girl wrote things on a piece of paper and smiled some more and told me to check again the next day and I said I would. Across the street the Marine was folding the grill back now and people were going in. I made a little more conversation with the young lady and then, not without a certain reluctance, went back out into the early morning heat and across to the U.S. Embassy, Samoy.</p>

    <p>Chapter One</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>At the Chancery reception desk, Alice Chan sat with her chin on her fists, looking out through the open entry at the people passing along the pavement in the glare of the early morning sun. Of what avail was it, she thought, to be young and pretty, and to be here each day in the place of the Americans, if even when she rose before dawn to dress her hair as it was shown in the Book of the Silver Screen, still the wonderful Mr. Henry Cummins and the others passed by her desk with scarce a glance . . .</p>
   <p>Alice gave a faint lift of her shoulders as a small man in a neat white suit—a half-caste—came up the steps, asked directions, gave her a condescending smile, went on. She sighed, opened the drawer of her desk, and drew out a worn movie magazine. She leafed through the thumbed pages, paused to read the caption under a picture of Rock Hudson, then let the magazine drop to the desk. She glanced at the clock over the elevator door: 7:10.</p>
   <p>Outside, a patient pi dog shifted, listlessly raised a mange-shaved leg to scratch; Monjee the doorman, who had been squatting in his accustomed place, was scrambling to his feet, thrusting his cigar toward the window ledge. Behind the dusty flank of an Embassy sedan at the curb, a man appeared, coming across the street, up the steps. This was a new American, one Alice had not seen before. He was tall, even for an American, and deep of chest, with hair that was turning grey, and cheerful eyes. She answered his request for directions to the office of the Administrative Officer and watched as he went off along the corridor. She was glad he had not stayed to talk to her any longer than was necessary, but she thought that it would be pleasant if another time he did not hurry past.</p>
   <subtitle>2</subtitle>
   <p>Bert Sutton, Embassy Administrative Officer, sat in his office looking at the framed poster showing a curving white beach with steep pine-covered hills rising behind it. It looked like a cool, clean place, where you could lie down on the sand and forget everything. Bert had cut the picture from an airline calendar and trimmed away all the advertising except the name of the airline in small print in one corner. He could always take the picture down before the inspectors arrived; or maybe they wouldn‘t notice the commercial message. Maybe he would leave it there, let them make something of it if they wanted to. To hell with the inspectors.</p>
   <p>Well, not exactly to hell with them, Sutton amended, straightening in his chair. The inspectors were doing an important job; probably they were swell fellows . . . . Maybe they‘d enjoy a game of golf, some bridge; Bert was a member of the Turf Club; they‘d probably get a kick out of watching the local ponies. And he could get them into Kuan Li, feed them a real Chinese banquet. He‘d better get that old devil Mr. Hu to line up a couple of special girls. Keep the nosy bastards busy . . .</p>
   <p>Burt turned and stared out through the window, thinking about how Marie Cummins had looked at the pool the day before, slim and full-bosomed in a French bathing suit. Even with her help, that light-weight husband of hers would never get to the top in the Service. Henry was servile enough—but you could tell he secretly preened himself on the fact that hed come in through the exam route, considered himself a cut above an integrated officer. Bert snorted at the thought of the condition the Embassy would be in with nothing but these ivory tower fellows around. By golly, they were lucky to have an experienced, dedicated man like Bert Sutton on the job here in the Admin Section.</p>
   <p>Bert thought about the morning ahead. It would take about twenty minutes to clear up the left-overs from yesterday afternoon; then after the mail, he would duck down to the snack bar for a cup of coffee; always a good idea to be sociable, crack a few jokes with the staff. Little Nancy from the Political Section was a cute item; she was usually down for coffee about nine.</p>
   <p>Then Bayard, the new man for Econ Section, was due in this morning; have to meet him, look him over. Just about time after that to check on the arrangements for the party, then beat it over to the Club and have a couple of gin-and-limes before Harry Yung How showed up for tennis.</p>
   <p>Bert uncapped his broad-pointed pen and carefully refilled it from the bottle of turquoise ink he kept in his desk, then lifted a sheaf of papers from his IN basket and started to work. Mabel tapped and came in.</p>
   <p>Bert looked up, frowning, holding the pen poised above the paper to indicate that he had been taken in mid-stroke.</p>
   <p>“Major Howard to see you, Mr. Sutton.”</p>
   <p>Bert frowned thoughtfully. Howard? Nobody of that name here. British Embassy, maybe? No, probably . . .</p>
   <p>“Anglo?” he inquired, frowning. He hated to talk to these fellows; always wondered how their fathers or grandfathers had ever gotten down to the level of consorting with native women. Ugly looking little scuts. Did they ever actually marry them? Imagine having your name passed around among generations of these spavined natives . . .</p>
   <p>Mabel was nodding. She leaned forward. One thing about Mabel, she didn‘t need any padding in the bosom department . . . She wasn‘t a bad looking girl. Too bad she wasn‘t a little younger.</p>
   <p>“He‘s just outside … ”</p>
   <p>Well, no help for it. He must have been waiting when the office opened. Alice Chan ought to stop these people at the front door, put them off.</p>
   <p>“Well, certainly, send Major Howard right in,” Bert said heartily.</p>
   <p>He leaned back, composed his features. A short, neat man came into the room. He had bushy grey hair and a face that would have looked English if it hadn‘t been so brown. Bert stood up, felt his face beaming.</p>
   <p>“Well, Major Howard, nice to see you. Here, just pull that chair around.”</p>
   <p>“Kind of you to receive me, Mr. Sutton. I am the General Secretary of the SFD, formerly of the British Samoyan Constabulary, now retired.”</p>
   <p>Howard laid a straight cane on the corner of Bert‘s desk, took a folded sheaf of papers from an inside jacket pocket. He unsnapped a broad rubber band securing the packet, and opened it out.</p>
   <p>“Mr. Sutton, our activity in our small party is largely now to keep surveillance over anti-democratic schemes cropping up here and there, because as politicians we are not so expert.” He smiled, showing even white teeth.</p>
   <p>“I see,” Bert said.</p>
   <p>“No doubt all is well known to your Embassy as to the workings of Communists here in our Republic. Nonetheless, I have now to hand intelligences of some bad hats going into action now on a big scale.” Howard laid out a sheet from his bundle. It was closely written in pencil.</p>
   <p>Bert leaned forward and looked at it.</p>
   <p>“Hmmm,” he said.</p>
   <p>“As you know, Mr. Sutton, Chinese agents are working now very actively among our coolies and sweeper castes, and along the wharves and in the trade unions. Our undercover chaps have turned up now that something big is in the wind. The take-over is set now for the spring of the year, during water festival, to cover starting of rioting ..</p>
   <p>“The take-over?”</p>
   <p>Major Howard looked at Bert. “These Reds are thoroughly bad fellows; they are bent on having it all their own way, you know. Now the riots—</p>
   <p>“I hardly think, Major Howard, that the Communists are in a position to, as you put it, ahh . . . take over.” Bert smiled patiently. “There are only a few thousand—</p>
   <p>“Precisely, Mr. Sutton! But each is a rabble-rouser, and the masses here in Samoy are not so well educated, you remember. Only a few promises, and they are off! The riots—</p>
   <p>Bert glanced at his watch. “I understand a few windows were broken over at the French Legation during the Laotian coup—thats about as violent as these crowds become. Theyre quite harmless, weve found, Major.</p>
   <p>“This is another matter, this time, excuse me, Mr. Sutton. The plan is first the heavy assault on U. S. Embassy, then moving along to Government Ho\ise. The assassinations—</p>
   <p>Bert rose. “Major Howard, it‘s been very nice seeing you, and I do hope you‘ll drop by again; unfortunately, I must run now; another meeting, you understand.” He came around the desk and helped Major Howard along to the door.</p>
   <p>“Don‘t forget your documents, Major.”</p>
   <subtitle>3</subtitle>
   <p>. . . I left the cute little Chinese girl at the front desk, found the office of the Admin Officer, waited while the heavy-faced girl exchanged countersigns with somebody through a half-open painted-over glass door, then went in. A rangy fellow with a tanned face and bags under his eyes dropped a cigarette in an ashtray, jumped up and gave me a big smile, pumped my hand, waved at a chair.</p>
   <p>“Well, Mr. Bayard, welcome to Samoy. Tm Bert Sutton, Admin Officer; just call me Bert We‘re a pretty informal bunch here.” Bert sobered suddenly.</p>
   <p>“Say, Brion, who met you at the airport last night?”</p>
   <p>“I managed to make it unassisted,” I said.</p>
   <p>“Oh.” Bert leaned back in his swivel chair, sat upright again.</p>
   <p>“Did you have any trouble in Customs?”</p>
   <p>“No trouble; took about an hour.”</p>
   <p>“An hour? That‘s outrageous! By golly, I wish Fd been out there. Diplomatic passport, too.” Sutton waggled his head sadly. “These fellows are getting pretty unreasonable. I‘m going to mention this to the Ambassador.” He made a note on a pad. “I‘ll draft a stiff note to Kinmong over at the Foreign Office.”</p>
   <p>Bert offered me a cigarette, lit up and put the cigarette in an ashtray.</p>
   <p>“Say, Brion, before we get into this— Bert smiled playfully at the papers piled on his desk—lets get you fixed up with some of the necessities. Ill take you downstairs and introduce you to the commissary staff and see to it you get some food in the house— He paused.</p>
   <p>“You<emphasis> do</emphasis> have quarters assigned?”</p>
   <p>“No, not yet.”</p>
   <p>“Say; m get on Cummins about that” Bert shook his head and looked solemn. “Some of these junior officers … “ He scribbled again.</p>
   <p>“Say, what about tonight? Reception at the Ambassador‘s, you know. I think you ought to come. I‘ll attend to an invitation for you. I‘ll have my driver drop around for you about seven thirty; chance to meet everybody.” Sutton rubbed his hands together and stood.</p>
   <p>“Well, Brion, maybe you‘d like to get with Tom Hurd over in Personnel. Hell take care of you, introduce you around and so on. Unfortunately, I have an appointment this morning and I‘m on a tight schedule. We can cover your Admin briefing tomorrow.” He gave me a fast grip of dismissal. In the outer office, the heavy-faced girl watched me, not smiling; I leered at her and went on out</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>In the Personnel Office, a long horsey-looking chap sitting hunched over a desk gave me a look like a country storekeeper who sees city folks coming in the door. I told him who I was and we jockeyed for a few minutes while he got the feel of how much weight he was going to be able to throw with me.</p>
   <p>“OK, Bayard,” he said. “I‘ll take you up and introduce you to the staff. Just sit down while I finish up signing off these reports.”</p>
   <p>“Never mind,” I told him. “Tell me where the Economic Section is, and I‘ll move along.”</p>
   <p>Hurd didn‘t want to miss anything; he unfolded and led me upstairs and into an office where a man with wiry brown hair and thick glasses sat behind a desk writing. He finished out the sentence, then looked at me and then at Hurd.</p>
   <p>“Oh, Tom,” he said. He laid the pen aside and stood up, slowly, as if he were tired.</p>
   <p>“Mr. Jakes, Brion Bayard. He‘s your new assistant up here in the Econ Section.”</p>
   <p>Jakes pulled his mouth sideways, took off the glasses and blinked at me. “Well, hardly my assistant, Tom.” He extended a hand. I tried it, gave it back to him.</p>
   <p>“How‘ve you been, Mr. Bayard? You‘re Dan‘s replacement?”</p>
   <p>Jakes waved toward the chairs, and I sat down.</p>
   <p>“You‘ve arrived at a good time, Bayard. Mr. Kerrigan and I have been going over some plans for a reorganization here within the Economic Section.” Jakes fitted his glasses back on and settled them in place.</p>
   <p>“I‘ve been carrying most of the administrative workload in addition to my substantive work, and the WEEKA in addition. And, of course, the Quarterly Summary.”</p>
   <p>I looked sympathetic.</p>
   <p>“I‘d like to turn the bulk of the routine work over to you as soon as possible, particularly the Trade and Export Opportunity and Inquiry Reports, and naturally, the WTDR‘S. I find that, frankly, I haven‘t a great deal of interest in these trivial, or rather, routine, matters. Of course, my substantive work consumes the bulk of my time.”</p>
   <p>I couldn‘t top that, so I said nothing.</p>
   <p>“I‘ll be passing a good deal of the alert reporting along to you, too, I think,” Jakes said. His tone was getting a little dreamy now, like somebody planning his vacation. “And our Commercial Library is badly behind date … ”</p>
   <p>“Hey, that sounds bad,” I said. I got out a cigar and peeled it.</p>
   <p>“Of course, you‘ll have the opportunity to do some reporting, too. I‘ll want to turn over Section Ten … “ A thoughtful look crossed Jakes‘ face. I lit the cigar.</p>
   <p>“You‘re familiar with CERP requirements of course?”</p>
   <p>I looked around and found an ashtray, and dropped the match in it.</p>
   <p>“Sorry,” I said. “Never heard of them.”</p>
   <p>Jakes blinked at me.</p>
   <p>“Just what has been your experience in Economic work, Mr. Bayard?”</p>
   <p>I hated to ruin his morning, but I told him.</p>
   <p>“Oh.” Jakes said. “I see.”</p>
   <p>“Gee whiz, fellas,” Hurd said. “I hate to break up this nice talk, but I got to be going.” He left us, and I went a a few more rounds with Jakes. We finally settled on an inspection of the Commercial Library as my first big assignment.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>I found my way down to the basement, picked a path back among stacked packing cases to a dusty door, eased it open. Two faces turned my way from behind a low railing against which bundled paper-covered books were stacked. Two pairs of feet dropped off the desks as I pushed past the swinging gate and looked around. There were two light fixtures, one with a black-speckled bulb, the other with a cluster of frayed extension cords leading to a fan, a radio, and a hot plate with the cover missing. There was a window, up high, the glass pretty heavily coated with Samoyan real estate.</p>
   <p>Around the room newspapers were heaped, loose and in bundles. Behind them you could see the glass doors of bookcases, with the shelves mostly empty. The two desks were covered with more newspapers, and pieces clipped from newspapers, and pieces trimmed off the clippings. The latter spilled over on the floor, radiating from a filled wastebasket. A large pair of shears, three empty tea cups, and yesterday‘s banana added a homey touch.</p>
   <p>The two chaps that went along with the faces and the feet were up now, looking around for clues to place me so they‘d know whether to start their explanations, or ask me for one. I told them where I fitted into the picture, which netted me two glassy smiles but no laughter. We shook hands and they told me their names and then we all stood for awhile and looked around at the newspapers.</p>
   <p>It was pretty clear that excavation was called for first, so I told the old boy, whose name was Nabi, to throw out the papers, wash the windows, sweep the floor, empty the wastebasket, get rid of the wires and put the books in the bookcases. I turned to go and a book fell from a high shelf to the floor in front of me. I looked up and spotted a third pair of feet, no better looking than the others.</p>
   <p>“What the hell is that?” I asked. Another book fell down.</p>
   <p>Nabi craned. He looked at me, dropped his chin to look over the glasses, didn‘t like it any better that way, went back to looking through them.</p>
   <p>“Friend of yours?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“Yes, friend!” Nabi smiled. I frowned. You could almost hear the smile hit the floor.</p>
   <p>“Is it alive?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, live, sir! Sleeping only, sir.”</p>
   <p>“Better tell him to get the hell down out of there.”</p>
   <p>Four more books hit the floor before the live friend made it down where I could look him over. He was skinny, dark, and unworried.</p>
   <p>“Who the hell are you?”</p>
   <p>“Tommy Dass, sir.” He yawned.</p>
   <p>“You on the payroll?”</p>
   <p>“Not getting enough pay, sir. I am messenger. There is so much work I have no time to pass my urine, sir.”</p>
   <p>I opened my mouth.</p>
   <p>“I am glad you like me, sir. I will work hard for you, sir. I am very hard worker.”</p>
   <p>“What the hell makes you think I like you?”</p>
   <p>“You curse me like man, sir. Other American gentlemen in Embassy always very polite like I was only servant, sir.”</p>
   <p>I let that one pass and went back upstairs. It turned out to be a long morning . . . .</p>
   <subtitle>4</subtitle>
   <p>After the door had closed upon the violent One who had upset the morning routine, Nabi turned to Oo Sin.</p>
   <p>“Did you hear how this One abused us?”</p>
   <p>“Clearly, Uncle. And now who will make the clipping of newspapers, with thee and me engaged in work of low caste sweepers?”</p>
   <p>Nabi blinked.</p>
   <p>“Oh, yes, Grandsire, did not the One tell thee to bestir thy venerable bones and sweep the floor? And to be a porter as well, carrying away the paper on thy back? And—</p>
   <p>“You know my hearing is not good, Oo Sin. Did the angry One say this?”</p>
   <p>“Verily, Uncle, and more—</p>
   <p>“Five and thirty years have I served faithfully in the clipping of the newspapers,” Nabi said. A tear trickled down. Oo Sin offered a handkerchief.</p>
   <p>“It is an evil thing, Grandfather. But what can a poor man do?”</p>
   <p>Nabi stood up. “I must tell this thing to Hurd Master. He will make a writing of it, and the angry One will sorrow that ever he abused faithful Nabi.”</p>
   <p>“Weep, ancient goat,” Tommy Dass said, examining the banana and dropping it on the floor. “I shall clean thy sty while thou art gone. Then when the Strong One hears of it, I will beat thee if he wishes it.”</p>
   <p>“My own nephew,” Nabi said sadly. “I go now to the snack bar for a Coca-Cola with ice squares in the American fashion; afterwards I relate all to the One-with-the face-of-a-pony. Meantime, Ah Soong, finish the clippings for yesterday and brew tea against my return.”</p>
   <subtitle>5</subtitle>
   <p>. . . a little after twelve, and I was standing in front of the Embassy thinking about lunch. Tom Hurd came out. We watched the beggars fanning out on the sidewalk to cover the row of cars at the curb.</p>
   <p>A legless chap mounted on a board with roller skate wheels glided up to me and extended an amazingly long arm with a cupped palm at the end of it.</p>
   <p>“Sah‘b,” he keened. “Sah‘b.”</p>
   <p>Hurd mopped at his face with a large yellowish handkerchief.</p>
   <p>“Beat it, Sammy,” he said cheerfully. “No baksheesh.” Sammy grinned and rolled on.</p>
   <p>“Old Sammy‘s an operator,” Hurd told me. “He‘s got the begging concession here. All the others got to pay him rent and a percentage.”</p>
   <p>I looked at them.</p>
   <p>“You‘ll get used to it,” Hurd said. “The cops come along and clear them out every once and a while, but Sammy fixes it and they‘re back the next day.”</p>
   <p>I was still looking.</p>
   <p>“They drop out now and again, die, you know,” Hurd said. “There‘s a waiting list for the vacancies. This is the hottest spot in town, since the Limeys run them off from over at the British Embassy.”</p>
   <p>I had a good lunch anyway: afterwards I paid another visit to the SAS office and had another nice talk with Ingred about my baggage, dated her up for the reception, then spent the rest of die afternoon getting to know Ben Jakes even better.</p>

    <p>Chapter Two</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>It was early evening when I picked Ingred up in Bert‘s Chevy, complete with driver. She looked even prettier in a silvery blue dress and silver white stole. “To hell with the Ambassador.” I said. “Let‘s go back to town and have a Chinese dinner with good old Pilsner from behind the iron curtain.”</p>
   <p>“But there is a big American movie cowboy waiting at the party to be met. I especially want to meet his horse. I have never met a horse socially.”</p>
   <p>“You‘ll have to settle for a lot of old goats,” I said. “Like me.”</p>
   <p>“You are fine,” she said. “You are good looking. You are a Viking.”</p>
   <p>We went on talking about nothing until the car swung into a drive and stopped under a broad porte-cochere, and a servant In a white coat stepped down and opened the car door.</p>
   <p>“Did I mention,” I said, “that we have to pick up Bert Sutton and his wife?”</p>
   <p>“Six times, I think,” Ingred said. “He is your big buddy, yes?”</p>
   <p>“He is my big buddy, no.”</p>
   <p>Bert Sutton appeared at the door. He wore a pleated shirt and a black tie. There was a glass in his hand. “Come on inside. Ruth‘ll be ready in a minute.”</p>
   <p>We followed Bert up the steps, along a dark hall hung with Chinese bronze trays, into a large dim-lit white-plastered room, pulled out teak-and wicker chairs. There were carved Buddhas on the low teak tables, Chinese scrolls on the wall, and two or three of those glass things that tinkle when the wind blows. I didn‘t see any opium pipes.</p>
   <p>“Tell me the secret, Brion.” Bert was grinning across from me to Ingred. “How did you find such a pretty girl so quick?”</p>
   <p>I thought over two answers and was working on a third when a middle-aged house-boy wearing a starched white jacket with a stiff turned-up collar, a bright wrap-around skirt and no shoes came into the room and offered a tray of tall glasses.</p>
   <p>“Gin-and-lime OK?‘ Bert said. “Krishna always thinks everybody wants gin-and-lime. It‘s pretty good.”</p>
   <p>I took the glass. There was no ice in it. The drink was too sweet. It was hot in the room.</p>
   <p>Ruth Sutton appeared, looking cool and detached in a sleek black dress. Bert made airy introductions without getting up, took another drink from the tray as Krishna passed.</p>
   <p>“Finish that up and have another, Brion,” he suggested. “You too, Miss Lund.”</p>
   <p>“Surely you don‘t prefer that revolting concoction,” Ruth Sutton said. “Bert didn‘t offer you a choice, I‘ll bet. I think he‘s trying to economize. Gin is only $1.19 at the commissary, and scotch is $1.89.”</p>
   <p>“What are you talking about,” Bert said. “Brion‘s crazy about gin-and-lime.”</p>
   <p>“You‘d better get your coat on, Bert,” Ruth said. “Sylvia will be having kittens if I‘m not over there early scuttling around counting glasses or something.”</p>
   <p>Bert finished his glass and stood up. “I‘m waiting for you, my dear.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Bert handed Ruth into the car, then Ingred. He climbed in beside her, so I went around the car and got in the front seat.</p>
   <p>“Who‘s the reception for?” Ruth asked.</p>
   <p>“Buck Miller. He‘s in here for USIS.”</p>
   <p>“Who is he, one of those god-awful cowboys?”</p>
   <p>“He‘s not so bad; I kind of like western singers, don‘t you, Brion?”</p>
   <p>“I can‘t say I‘m a fan,” I said. “But I have to admire his patriotism.”</p>
   <p>“Well, of course, he‘s paid by USIS. He gets fifty dollars a day, plus per diem.”</p>
   <p>“Even these yodellers aren‘t as bad as that basketball player,” Ruth said.</p>
   <p>“Buck went over big with the college students last night.”</p>
   <p>“If we‘re going to be briefing people,” Ruth said, “I think I ought to warn Miss Lund about Mr. Khan. Don‘t let him get you with your back to the wall.”</p>
   <p>“Mr. Khan is a real screwball,” Bert said, chuckling. “He‘s got about eighty-five million dollars and he thinks he can have anything he wants. He likes the girls.”</p>
   <p>“It wouldn‘t be so bad,” Ruth said, “but he weighs three hundred pounds and he‘s ugly as sin.”</p>
   <p>“Now after the outside guests start arriving, Brion,” Bert resumed, “your job is to see to it that they don‘t stand around alone. Jump right in and introduce yourself and get them talking. Then introduce them to somebody and get another one.”</p>
   <p>“I think the theory is,” Ruth said, “if two of the guests are left alone together, they‘ll start saying nasty things about the Americans.”</p>
   <p>“You won‘t see much of Miss Lund until the evening‘s over,” Bert said. “You‘re a working man tonight.”</p>
   <p>“Brion, you circulate with Miss Lund,” Ruth said. “Bert wants to get her away from you so he can monopolize her.”</p>
   <p>“Hey!” Bert said. “Miss Lund will get the wrong idea!”</p>
   <p>“In addition to Mr. Khan and Bert,” Ruth said, “there‘s one other menace to look out for. If Fred Chalmers gets too much to drink—and theres no reason to suppose he wont—</p>
   <p>“Now, Ruth,” Bert said. “Fred‘s really a wonderful fellow. He drinks pretty heavily, but with his responsibilities—</p>
   <p>“He‘s easy to identify: a little fellow about 60 dressed like Adolphe Menjou and with a glass in his hand. Just don‘t let him inveigle you into a stroll, Miss Lund.”</p>
   <p>“Say, there‘s the Daijee Pagoda,” Bert said. “One of the biggest in the world. Looks nice, all lit up.”</p>
   <p>There were few houses now. The road followed the curving shoreline of a lake. There were lights on the other side.</p>
   <p>“That‘s the Residence, over there,” Bert said. “That‘s the German Legation next to it.”</p>
   <p>An orange full moon had risen above tree top level and you could see the giant trees along the road and the thatched huts clustered under them. Kerosene lamps showed through open windows and here and there a bare light bulb hung in front of a tiny stall where people sat outside at trestle tables drinking tea and eating in the still, amber evening light.</p>
   <p>The driver held the car in the center of the road, working the horn and passing automobiles and cows or people who stared into the headlights. Once he swerved as a bus clattered past, running without lights.</p>
   <p>The car swung into a gravelled drive and stopped at a wide green-painted gate. A small man in brown shorts came out from behind the gatehouse, unlatched the gate and swung it open. The drive curved in a broad arc, and now you could see the colored lights around the garden, hanging in long strings above the hedges.</p>
   <p>“We‘re early,” Bert said. “I don‘t see any other cars ahead of us.”</p>
   <p>A footman in a white uniform stepped forward and opened the door of the car. I got out and opened Ruth‘s door. She took my hand as she stepped out “Why, thank you, Mr. Bayard,” she said “I‘m so used to clambering out unassisted … ”</p>
   <p>“Brion,” Bert called. “I wonder if you‘d mind—</p>
   <p>He waited until Ruth and I came up to where he stood with one hand resting on Ingred‘s back. “I want to hustle on back and check the bar arrangements, count the liquor and so on; would you mind going in and checking with Swami—hes the head bearer—on the soft drinks. Make sure theyre on ice. And check on the P.A. system, be sure its all ready to go.</p>
   <p>“Sure,” I said. “Come on, Ingred.”</p>
   <p>“You‘d better go alone,” Bert said.</p>
   <p>Ingred came over and took my hand. “Come,” she said. “I‘m very good at seeing that the soda-water is iced.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>We came out of the house and went through the receiving line and on into the garden.</p>
   <p>“How did you like Mr. Buck Miller?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“He had face powder on. He has spoiled my illusions about American cowboys.”</p>
   <p>“American cowboys should be seen only at a distance, preferably on horseback.”</p>
   <p>“I think having a bar at this party is a very good idea.”</p>
   <p>“What will you have?”</p>
   <p>“Brandy and soda.”</p>
   <p>Music started up from behind the hedge.</p>
   <p>“Is that a real band?” Ingred asked.</p>
   <p>“Benny Chin Lee and his Sweet-and-Sour Five.”</p>
   <p>“Where are they?”</p>
   <p>“Back of the bushes; self-defense.”</p>
   <p>We went on across the lawn and looked at the lights and listened to the band and watched the people.</p>
   <p>The lawn was crowded now. The band was barely audible above the voices. People stood in groups of four or five, glass in hand, smiling and talking. We looked at the dresses, and the gaudy tropical uniforms, the varied costumes of the diplomatic corps. Tom Hurd, awkward-looking in an ill-fitting white coat, was talking to a tiny Japanese woman in traditional dress, and a man in a dinner jacket and a purple turban laughed at what he said. Beyond them a sandy-haired man in a pea jacket and tight white trousers with a broad red stripe leaned toward a short Russian in a white uniform with gold-bordered red shoulder-boards.</p>
   <p>I caught sight of Ruth Sutton.</p>
   <p>“Having fun?” she called.</p>
   <p>“Oh, yes,” Ingred said.</p>
   <p>“Remember the magic word,” Ruth called. “Circulate.”</p>
   <subtitle>2</subtitle>
   <p>Maybe Harvey wasn‘t here tonight, Ruth Sutton thought; at any rate she hadn‘t seen him. The lawn was still so crowded that it was difficult to find anyone—not that she was looking for him, of course. She wondered just what hed meant last night, or if hed meant anything at all. Probably he hadnt. No doubt he had other interests. After all, he was handsome, a bachelor and only 38, in spite of being a full colonel.</p>
   <p>There he was. Ruth stopped and a circle opened to include her. From the corner of her eye she could see Colonel Harvey Throst chatting with his counterpart from the British Embassy. He looked handsomer in the civilian clothes he wore to the office. Somehow those starched whites looked rather prissy and theatrical; but he was still damned attractive—and very masculine.</p>
   <p>He could certainly see her from where he was standing. Probably he wouldn‘t come over though. Last night he had just had too much to drink. But, no, now he was strolling over this way . . . Ruth turned away, carefully not looking at Harvey. She heard a step beside her, then felt his hand close over hers. It was an exciting and possessive gesture. Anyone else would have just cleared his throat . . .</p>
   <p>“Ruth, where have you been all evening?”</p>
   <p>She turned, looking surprised.</p>
   <p>“Why, Harvey, don‘t you look nice in your whites. There‘s nothing like a uniform … ”</p>
   <p>“You look pretty damned gorgeous yourself, Ruth. Listen, I‘m going to throw a dance over at my place next week and I want to be sure you‘ll be there. What night are you free?”</p>
   <p>“Why, Harvey,” Ruth said, “How nice. I‘ll have to ask Bert what he‘s let us in for during the week.”</p>
   <p>“To hell with Bert,” Harvey said softly.</p>
   <p>“Well, really, Harvey— she started; then she laughed.</p>
   <p>“I‘m sure we‘re free Wednesday … ”</p>
   <p>“Wednesday it is,” Harvey said, “and don‘t figure on party hopping. It‘ll be a full evening.”</p>
   <p>“Wonderful. But Harvey, I‘ll be getting dirty looks from Sylvia if I stand here talking to you any longer. I‘m setting a bad example for the younger girls. Why don‘t you come over to the house for a drink afterwards?”</p>
   <p>“I‘ll be there.”</p>
   <p>She smiled and turned away.</p>
   <subtitle>3</subtitle>
   <p>Colonel Harvey Throst plucked a fresh drink from a passing tray. That, he thought, was a damned fine looking woman. Why the hell did Sutton make an ass of himself chasing secretaries with a wife like Ruth? It was typical of these State types. None of them knew what the hell was what.</p>
   <p>Throst sipped his drink, looked around. His eye fell on the pudgy figure of General Winjee. Take that sly little devil, for example. None of them had a clue to what he was hatching out of his dowdy little office at the War Ministry. It had taken some clever work—and some tactics that would have made the State boys blanch—but he had set up a pipeline right to Winjees office. He had the dope on the coming coup—and they couldnt say he hadnt warned them. He was covered in the record all right. The important information was planted in the middle of these fifty page reports he presented at staff meetings, everything hed ferreted out through his own channels, in full detail, well-documented; but theyd never read it, any more than CINC USARPAC would—and that was fine. It fitted in perfectly with his plans. When the show-down came, they couldnt say he hadnt reported it all. And it wouldnt be long now. Another few months at most, and if he played it right there was a star in it for him.</p>
   <p>But to hell with Winjee; things were looking pretty good for tonight. There was no mistaking it; Ruth Sutton liked him. This could be a damned interesting evening yet</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>A hand slapped Throst low on the back. He turned; Fred Chalmers peered up at him, blinking through rimless glasses; he laid a hand on Throst‘s crisp white lapel, leaned on it slightly.</p>
   <p>“Oh, Colonel,” he said, “T want to speak to you about something.”</p>
   <p>Throst waited.</p>
   <p>“What I wanted to say— Chalmers said, —yes; were planning a little American-style ICA open house, for next month, perhaps about the tenth. I thought I might just check with you, Harvey, you being senior service attache. Do you suppose the Air Force might be prevailed upon to fly our supplies in from Bangkok? Chalmers shifted his drink to his left hand, leaned on the other lapel.</p>
   <p>“It will be a wonderful thing for ICA public relations. We‘re planning on about twenty-five hams, forty turkeys, fifty tenderloins and about twenty-five dozen weiners. There‘ll be American ice cream, beer—Weve made arrangements through the commissary store at Bangkok. If you can arrange to fly it over for us, it would help us out considerably.</p>
   <p>“All right, Fred, 111 mention it to Macy.”</p>
   <p>“That will be marvelous, Colonel.”</p>
   <p>“Say Fred,” Throst said, “what have you fellows finalized on that police equipment?”</p>
   <p>“Ah,” Fred blinked. “We‘ve been giving that a lot of study, of course. I believe Micky could give you our thinking on that. There are still a few problem areas we‘re playing around with.”</p>
   <p>Throst looked at Chalmers; the man wouldn‘t have lasted a week in the army . . . Funny how he could look immaculate with scotch dribbled down the front of his $200 suit.</p>
   <p>“ . . . We‘re thinking about trying to get a decent band brought in. I‘m checking with USIS on a possible tie-in with one of their touring groups. We want to make this a real occasion ...”</p>
   <p>Throst listened a little longer, then disengaged himself and moved on. The crowd was thinning out now. Most of the Samoyans were gone and the foreign diplomatic guests were moving toward the gate. The Ambassador would be giving the nod to the staff any minute now. Throst picked another glass from a passing tray. Well, he‘d better go over and have a few words with Winjee. After all, they were pals . . .</p>
   <subtitle>4</subtitle>
   <p>Bert Sutton smiled and answered gaily. What was the damned woman talking about? His eyes roved, looking for the fluffy dress with the big flowers on it; he had caught a glimpse of her over here by the french doors, and then this infernal gabby Madame Dubret had collared him; he had to get away . . .</p>
   <p>“Oh, Tom,” Bert called suddenly. “Excuse my interrupting, Mme. Dubret, but I‘d like you to meet Tom Hurd, of the Embassy. Mme. Dubret was just telling me about her trip to Bangkok … ”</p>
   <p>Bert left Tom standing nervously with a drink in each hand. Now where was Marie?</p>
   <p>Bert glanced inside; maybe she had gone in to check something in the kitchen. These junior officers‘ wives were all the same; always pushing, making an impression. But that was all to the good; she knew who Henry‘s boss was . . .</p>
   <p>Henry was still at the gate, handshaking. He was on ice for the evening; just a word to Jakes, and Henry was invited to help out. Neat. He‘d worked a long time to reach a position where he could exercise these little prerogatives . . . .</p>
   <p>Ah, there she was—talking to two other Embassy wives, ignoring their duties, acting as if this were a jolly social get-together, hanging around in little groups like housewives over a backyard fence in Indiana.</p>
   <p>Bert moved up beside Marie. “Say, you girls had better spread some of that charm around among our guests. I see several of them just wandering around.” He was smiling, waiting for them to turn away. He touched Marie Cummins‘ arm.</p>
   <p>“Oh, Marie, a few of us are going over to my place after this; make an evening of it. Ruth and I would specially like for you and Henry to join the party.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you; I‘m sure Henry will want to come,” Marie smiled nervously. “I‘m afraid Henry hasn‘t had much fun so far this evening,” she added.</p>
   <p>“Well, swell,” Mr. Sutton said. “We‘ll get together just before we leave here.” He glanced at his watch. “Should be breaking up in another forty-five minutes. Some of the Samo-yans are starting to leave already.” He patted her hand and strolled on. Marie was cute, all right, but there was no point in attracting attention. He liked to watch the play of expression across her face, smooth as a baby‘s—she couldnt be over twenty. And he liked her respect and deference; yes, hed be seeing a lot of Marie.</p>
   <p>He drifted over to join a group, selecting a position from which the Ambassador could observe his affability and the cordiality of his relations with the Samoyans. There was no doubt that he was among the most popular of the staff with the locals. Bert kidded and chuckled automatically, mentally reviewing his plans for the evening. There was nothing like a little late informal drinking to break the ice. He‘d tell Tom Hurd to come along and maybe one or two of the secretaries.</p>
   <p>He felt a hand on his elbow, turned to see Bradley Paine, looking dignified as usual.</p>
   <p>“Why, hi, Brad, do you know all these nice people?” Paine smiled, nodded, led Bert away a few feet.</p>
   <p>“Bert,” Paine said briskly, “you and Ruth drop over for a drink before you head home, will you? And round up a few of the younger folk. I‘m in the mood for some informal company.”</p>
   <p>“Well, say, Brad, that‘s darn nice of you. Matter of fact, Ruth and I were planning a little get-together at our place … ”</p>
   <p>“Fine, bring your whole party along.”</p>
   <p>Bert watched Paine move off easily, looking self-satisfied. Damn his hide. So Brad was going to try outmaneuvering him, was he. Well, he‘d see about that . . . .</p>
   <subtitle>5</subtitle>
   <p>Deputy Prime Minister Chaw smiled, showing betel-stained teeth.</p>
   <p>“You‘re going to be very pleased, Bradley, with the draft of the mining legislation. I‘ll be sending it over to you in the morning. We managed to bring the Minister and the Director of Mines around to a workable compromise position.”</p>
   <p>“I‘m looking forward to seeing it, Chaw,” Deputy Chief of Mission Bradley Paine said. “I hope you found some of my comments helpful.” Damn the fellow, Paine thought. His recommendations had better be embodied in this bill. Without his continually dunning into these fellows the importance of foreign investment, they‘d have turned the new law into still another piece of anti-western asininity, in spite of their desperate need for outside capital.</p>
   <p>“I‘m in hopes,” Chaw was saying, “that your Department of Commerce will give the widest publicity to the new regulations.”</p>
   <p>Well, in spite of the mining law, Paine reflected, the new Police Equipment Agreement would give the government a shot in the arm, stave off the inevitable collapse for another few months. Four months would be sufficient. He would be on his way by then.</p>
   <p>Retirement; it would be wonderful to relax at last the vigilance of thirty years. In a way it was a pity he was retiring, now that he had learned the ropes so thoroughly. A few years ago he might have found it rather awkward handling a chap like Bert Sutton, for example. It was not enough merely to neutralize a Sutton, to block the various gambits which an ambitious junior would naturally employ in feeling out a senior for exploitable weaknesses; the truly successful career man had to be able to manipulate such men to his own advantage.</p>
   <p>“ . . . of course,” Chaw was saying, “the danger from insurgent activity is actually trivial but there is no doubt that this decision will reassure potential investors.”</p>
   <p>“I‘ll be looking forward with great interest to seeing the draft, Chaw.” Chaw was tedious company. Perhaps if he steered him toward the line where the last few guests were performing their farewell rituals . . .</p>
   <p>Five minutes later, with the Deputy Prime Minister pumping the hand of Mr. Buck Miller, Bradley Paine smoothed his lapels and turned back toward the garden.</p>
   <subtitle>6</subtitle>
   <p>Bert Sutton went over to Henry Cummins standing at the gate.</p>
   <p>“Brad Paine asked me to pass along his invitation to you and Marie, Henry,” Bert said.</p>
   <p>Henry pulled the black nylon handkerchief from the breast pocket of his white dacron jacket and daubed at his forehead.</p>
   <p>“Golly, Bert,” he said, “do you suppose we could beg off . . .</p>
   <p>Bert looked at the younger man without expression, turned and walked away.</p>
   <p>Henry turned back to the almost empty lawn. The line had broken up; the Ambassador and the rest had gone inside. He could leave now, except that he had promised to give Mrs. Sutton a ride. Actually, he could have gone along with Bert and Marie. Bert and Marie . . . He didn‘t like the sound of it. Marie and Bert . . .</p>
   <p>Ruth Sutton came across the lawn.</p>
   <p>“It looks as though we‘re the last survivors,” she said. “Have you seen Bert?”</p>
   <p>There was a momentary silence.</p>
   <p>“He went on ahead, Mrs. Sutton,” Henry said. “He asked me to bring you over.”</p>
   <p>Ruth raised her eyebrows. “After all, the honeymoon<emphasis> is </emphasis>over,” she said; “I don‘t know why I‘m surprised. He didn‘t by any chance have a little friend with him, did he?”</p>
   <p>“Just Marie; she was glad to get a chance to sit down a few minutes early, instead of having to wait for me.”</p>
   <p>“Well, that was very thoughtful of Bert. Are we all ready to depart?”</p>
   <p>They walked across the gravelled drive and an island of trimmed grass to Henry‘s car. The three tan-jacketed local policemen who had been directing traffic stood at the corner of the building under a light, dividing up partially emptied bottles of bonded scotch and bourbon. The full moon reflected from the lake, illuminating the palms and massed hibiscus along the drive.</p>
   <p>“Such a lovely evening,” Ruth said.</p>
   <p>“I‘ll take the short cut around the north end of the lake,” Henry said.</p>
   <subtitle>7</subtitle>
   <p>. . . Paine, the Deputy Chief, stopped us on the lawn to invite us over to his place. There were a dozen or so people there, slumped down in chairs out on the terrace by the big aquarium, drinking and nibbling food. We found a quiet corner and sat and listened to the dance music and looked out at the moonlight on the lawn and the lake.</p>
   <p>“Why don‘t you dance with me?” Ingred said. “Look at the other gentlemen being gallant. Aren‘t you ashamed?”</p>
   <p>“Sure,” I said. “Listen. Let‘s go somewhere tomorrow; you wear that Chinese dress you told me about, and I‘ll be so gallant you won‘t be able to stand it.”</p>
   <p>“My Chinese dress? The one with the slit skirt? That is an immoral suggestion. I will do it.”</p>
   <p>Ingred was tall and had straight blonde hair and wide-set violet eyes and the kind of figure that gets better every year, and she was twenty-nine, so it was just about perfect Dancing with her was no hardship at all.</p>
   <p>I noticed Chalmers, a dandified little bird who headed up the ICA staff levering himself up out of a chair and moving out toward Henry Cummins and his wife, and I had a feeling there was going to be trouble. Chalmers came up and pushed right in, and Cummins let him get away with it. Marie Cummins didn‘t seem to think much of the idea, but she was too inexperienced to do anything about it. Cummins walked away, and the girl had all she could do to keep Chalmers on his feet.</p>
   <p>Marie Cummins was a cute little doll with soft brown hair and an innocent look, and a figure that could give ideas to men a lot soberer than Chalmers; he was drunk enough to try to do something about it. Marie stifled a yelp and elbowed his hand back into fair territory, but I‘ll say this for Chalmers; he wasn‘t easily discouraged. He had another hand and it was just as active as the first.</p>
   <p>I eased Ingred over to the sidelines and crossed over to Chalmers and tapped him on the shoulder.</p>
   <p>“Go ‘way, Buster,” he suggested.</p>
   <p>I put a hand under Chalmers‘ elbow just as he made another grab for Marie. He didn‘t like my spoiling his aim; he scored with a kick to the shin, and I spun him around, clamped his wrists behind his back, and we moved off toward the door.</p>
   <p>“Time for you to turn in, old-timer,” I said.</p>
   <p>Everybody was watching now but nobody moved. Chalmers struggled but I had him outweighed. He sputtered, and I frog-marched him down the hall and out onto the front porch. He slumped against a pillar and breathed hard. I told the butler to call his car.</p>
   <p>“Who the hell are you?” Chalmers said. “Don‘t you know I‘m Counsellor of Embassy for ICA Affairs? Get your filthy hands off me.”</p>
   <p>I held on to him and his car came up and I turned him over to the driver who didn‘t look surprised, but just handed him into the back seat and drove off. I went back inside but the party was over . . . .</p>

    <p>Chapter Three</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The next morning Mabel called me from the Admin Office and said Bert Sutton had something he wanted to talk about. In Sutton‘s office I sat down and got out a match and lit a cigar and waited.</p>
   <p>“Brion, you‘re new to the service,” Sutton said. “I realize that. It‘s unfortunate that you found yourself in an awkward position with relation to Fred Chalmers before you had time to actually get an understanding of the Foreign Service Way.”</p>
   <p>I waited for something a little more concrete.</p>
   <p>“Now, I‘ve been with the Counsellor, Brad Paine, on this thing this morning, and we‘ve agreed that it will be the best thing all around if we can clear it up with the least possible damage to anyone‘s career.”</p>
   <p>I blew out some smoke.</p>
   <p>“Brad has had a talk with Fred on it, and I‘m fairly sure now that if you‘ll just go to Fred—explain that you didnt realize—youre new—well, I think Fred will be willing to just overlook the whole thing.</p>
   <p>I looked at my cigar. Then I looked at Sutton.</p>
   <p>“No kidding,” I said.</p>
   <p>Sutton nodded, then frowned. “No, I‘m certainly not kidding. This is not a kidding matter.”</p>
   <p>“Chalmers wants me to come up and apologize to him, does he?”</p>
   <p>“It wasn‘t a simple matter to bring Fred to see it that way.”</p>
   <p>“I can see why.”</p>
   <p>“I hope so.”</p>
   <p>I stood up. “Anything else?” I said.</p>
   <p>“You‘re going to see Fred now?”</p>
   <p>“Sorry; I won‘t be able to make it.”</p>
   <p>“Look here, Bayard,” Bert said. He was getting red in the face now. “I might as well tell you that an ICA despatch demanding your immediate recall crossed Brad Paine‘s desk at seven fifteen this morning. He held it up to check into; you‘re a very lucky individual to be getting this chance to get off the hook so easily.”</p>
   <p>He got up and came around the desk. “Look, Brion, a little bending won‘t hurt you. Fred‘s a big man in this Embassy. An apology won‘t take a minute.” He clapped me on the shoulder.</p>
   <p>“Frankly, between us, I can see that Fred may have stepped over the line a little. Fred gets a little informal when he‘s relaxing at a party; after all, a senior member of the Embassy staff . . . . Well, why make an issue of it?”</p>
   <p>The cigar didn‘t taste good any more. I stubbed it out in an ashtray.</p>
   <p>“Fred‘s a pretty proud man,” Sutton said. “He wants an apology.”</p>
   <p>“He needs a keeper.”</p>
   <p>“By God,” Bert snapped. “If a fellow wants to be as unreasonable as you, there‘s no help for him. I‘ll have no choice but to report to Brad Paine that you‘ve taken a high-handed line.”</p>
   <p>“Never mind. I‘ll tell him myself.”</p>
   <p>Sutton turned to his desk and flipped an intercom key.</p>
   <p>“Bert here, Brad; do you have a minute? Bayard and I would like to come up … ”</p>
   <p>We left the office and went along the hall to the elevator.</p>
   <subtitle>2</subtitle>
   <p>Bradley Paine turned his chair so that he could look out through the window at the sky. For the moment he didn‘t feel like looking at Sutton or listening to his chatter. He should have known better than to let Sutton try to smooth the affair over; he had only succeeded in making an issue of it. As clever as Sutton was in some ways, it was this sort of thing that downgraded his Efficiency Reports; and he was able to sit complacently, apparently quite sure of himself. The man lacked judgment.</p>
   <p>There was a discreet tap on the door, and Cummins came into the room. He looked upset. Fred must have gone even farther than he had thought. Maybe this<emphasis> was</emphasis> serious. But these young officers had to learn that in the Foreign Service, personal considerations took second place. Sophistication came hard, but it had to come. In the business of diplomacy, it was people you were dealing with. They represented governments, they spoke on behalf of parliaments and kings; but they were human. They liked good food, fine whiskey, entertainment. A man was inclined to deal generously with one who gave him a good game of golf or bridge, who lost a little to him at poker, who told a good story. And with a crucial negotiation at stake, and your future in the balance—well, it wasnt wise to be too jealous of a little attention to your wife . . .</p>
   <p>“Sit down, Henry,” Paine said. Cummins took a chair.</p>
   <p>“Henry, would you mind telling us what occurred last evening, as you saw it?”</p>
   <p>Cummins straightened his glasses, shifted in his chair.</p>
   <p>“Well … “ he cleared his throat. “Marie and I were dancing, and Mr. Chalmers cut in. He . . . seemed to be feeling pretty good,” Cummins stopped, pulled at his collar.</p>
   <p>“Then Mr. Bayard tried to cut in; Mr. Chalmers didn‘t want to . . . he wouldn‘t let him. So he took hold of his arm, and walked him outside.” Cummins looked at Bayard, fell silent.</p>
   <p>“Is that all, Henry? You may speak quite frankly. Did you feel that Mr. Chalmers was behaving improperly?”</p>
   <p>“Well . . . . Marie isn‘t used to anybody pulling her around like that … ”</p>
   <p>“Did you feel that it was appropriate for Mr. Bayard to interfere; that is, to cut in?”</p>
   <p>“Well, I was watching; I thought maybe I should do something about it, if it got any worse. I guess Mr. Bayard thought he ought to … “ Cummins looked at Bayard. “I was glad Mr. Bayard cut in . . . at first … ”</p>
   <p>Paine and Sutton were looking at Cummins.</p>
   <p>“I was sort of surprised when Mr. Bayard took Mr. Chalmers outside … ”</p>
   <p>“You didn‘t feel that Mr. Chalmers intended any offense, then?”</p>
   <p>“I think he was just feeling good, sir.”</p>
   <p>“I see.” Paine looked at him sharply.</p>
   <p>“Of course,” Henry said, “If I had felt like Mr. Chalmers was doing anything wrong, I would have said something myself.”</p>
   <p>Bert Sutton nodded approvingly.</p>
   <p>“Thank you, Henry,” Paine said. “I‘m sure that both you and Marie will have as little as possible to say about this incident!”</p>
   <p>“Oh, certainly, Mr. Paine. It‘s forgotten already.”</p>
   <p>“And you might find occasion to say a word to Mr. Chalmers; let him know that there are no ill feelings.”</p>
   <p>“Sure, Mr. Paine. I was meaning to see him … ”</p>
   <p>After Henry left the room, the three men sat silently for a moment. Bert glanced sideways at Bayard. Good old Henry had come through in good style, put Bayard out on a limb. Maybe Henry was learning after all. And Henry was taking the right attitude as far as Marie was concerned, too. And Chalmers couldn‘t have given him a better boost—after having little Freds hands all over her, Bert would look like a million by comparison.</p>
   <p>“It seems that Mr. Cummins takes a different view of the incident than you, Mr. Bayard,” Bradley Paine said.</p>
   <p>“It looks that way,” Bayard said.</p>
   <p>“Now look here— Bert started.</p>
   <p>“Bert, I think Mr. Bayard and I had better discuss this matter a bit further. Thank you for your help … ”</p>
   <p>Paine waited until the door had closed behind Sutton. He sighed.</p>
   <p>“These little crises arise, Mr. Bayard, and we must deal with them as best we can. Obviously, Mr. Chalmers‘ eccentricities pose a problem. I‘m at fault myself for providing the liquor in this instance. I wasn‘t aware that he‘d had quite so much.</p>
   <p>“On the other hand, Mr. Chalmers is an extremely able economist. I don‘t think the fact is generally recognized, but Fred is independently wealthy; his offering of his services to the government is an admirable gesture. I hope you‘ll see that in the best interest of the Embassy, the matter should be treated as what it is; an unfortunate aberration. What Fred Chalmers really needs now is reassurance that he is still a man of some consequence. The recollection of having been publicly humiliated, as he considers it, is not one that he can lightly endure. A word from you would relieve the situation.”</p>
   <p>“I‘m sorry,” Bayard said. “I have no apology to offer Mr. Chalmers.”</p>
   <p>Paine looked at him with an expression of strained patience.</p>
   <p>“Very well, Mr. Bayard. I can hardly insist.” He turned his chair and looked out the window. Monsoon clouds loomed in the sky. The rains would be coming soon. He had watched four monsoons come and go here in Samoy. Before the rains ended he would be home, in Florida perhaps, or California. He had spent too many years in the tropics to welcome the prospect of cold winters. But in the meantime, there was still the game to play, the threads to be manipulated and above all, crises to be avoided.</p>
   <p>Paine turned back to Bayard. “I‘m going to talk to Mr. Chalmers, and I‘m going to say what is necessary to make him happy. I hope that you will say nothing to dispel any illusions I may create in Mr. Chalmers‘ mind.”</p>
   <subtitle>3</subtitle>
   <p>Bert hesitated at the elevator. Funny Brad hadn‘t let him stay. He had a right, in a way, to hear what went on. It couldn‘t be, could it, that Brad was going to back down? Was that why he had told Bert to get out? Would he undercut Bert, make a fool of him?</p>
   <p>But Paine couldn‘t do that. Chalmers was an important man, and he was out for blood. Brad would back Bert, see to it that Fred got his apology. It couldn‘t be any other way.</p>
   <p>Sure, Bayard would be along this way in a minute with the starch taken out of him, and you could depend on it he would think twice before bucking the Admin Officer again. A senior officer worked a long time to get where he was, and no newcomer was going to rock the boat. One crack in the structure, and where was your security, your prerogatives of seniority? Bayard would realize some day that the very thing that he was fighting now was what made the Foreign Service what it was—the last stronghold of Deserved Privilege.</p>
   <p>Bert looked at the clock above the elevator. What was keeping him? Surely the fool wasn‘t giving Brad Paine an argument. Even Bayard, stubborn as he was, would have better sense. And Brad wouldn‘t mince words with him; Brad was a man who always extracted every ounce of his due. Bert thought of the times he had been summoned without notice to take part in one of Brad‘s parties, make up a foursome, or just be available. Brad rightly expected Bert to be on the job, just as Bert in turn had a right to the support of men like Bayard. It was simple justice.</p>
   <p>The door opened down the hall and Bayard came out Bert made a show of moving briskly along. He glanced at Bayard‘s expression for a clue to the severity of the interview. Bayard looked relaxed, frowning slightly perhaps. Well, let him keep up the facade. He would just say a word to show his own patient good-nature . . .</p>
   <p>“Oh, Brion,” Bert said in a casual tone, with only a touch of surprise at encountering him here . . . . He looked at him kindly, put a hand on his shoulder. “You‘ll feel better for it once you‘ve seen Fred. You‘ll find he‘s a pretty grand fellow at heart.”</p>
   <p>Bayard looked at Bert. “Forget it Sutton.”</p>
   <p>“Why . . . why … “ Bert groped for words. Around him, a structure seemed to totter . . . .</p>
   <p>Bayard stepped past him. “I‘ll see you around, Bert” he said.</p>
   <p>Sutton closed the door, unlocked the safe-file, and took out a bottle of Jack Daniels. There was a glass on his desk, beside the thermos pitcher. He half-filled it added water, and downed it.</p>
   <p>All right Sutton thought Paine had let him down. But Bert Sutton had ways of protecting himself; there were methods . . . Bert picked up the intercom and dialed.</p>
   <p>“Tom,” he said, “there‘s a personnel matter I want to go over with you. Bring in Bayard‘s file.”</p>
   <p>He replaced the instrument, reached across and pressed the button on his desk. Mabel tapped and came in.</p>
   <p>“Close the door, Mabel.” He waited while she drew out a chair, opened her pad.</p>
   <p>“Memo for the Record,” he said. “Subject: Mr. Brion Bayard.”</p>

    <p>Chapter Four</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Tom Hurd, personnel officer, pushed through the heavy swinging door to the Chancery wing. The air was cooler here; there was a thick wine-red carpet on the floor of the corridor, and to one side a young woman sat behind a polished desk. She smiled warmly at Tom.</p>
   <p>“Good afternoon, Mr. Hurd,” she said. She had a cool, melodious voice.</p>
   <p>“How‘s things, Miss Polanski?” Tom said. “Is Mr. Chalmers in his office this afternoon?”</p>
   <p>“Things are fine, Mr. Hurd; and Mr. Chalmers is in.”</p>
   <p>“You know, Miss Polanski, I knew what I was doing when I put you on this job, where all the local big shots can see a sample of what we got back in the States.”</p>
   <p>Tom grinned; even a snazzy number like Polanski ate that stuff up. That was what made Tom Hurd a good personnel man, knowing that kind of psychological stuff. It never hurt to be chummy with these show-piece dollies around the Chancery. You could pick up a lot of good dope that way. Maybe he ought to kind of alert Polanski. Not come right out with it, but let her get the idea that anything she got on Bayard to just mention it to Tom. These little items from the girls helped a file a lot; filled in the picture of a trouble-maker that kept the clerical staff stirred up. Bert was going to be pleased with the way he was building this one.</p>
   <p>“Well, I got to see Chalmers about this new fellow,” he said, looking serious. That was enough of a hint for a sharp dame like Polanski. He let his eyes linger on her low-cut dress as he moved off. “Keep everything in shape,” he said.</p>
   <p>Keep them happy, that was the thing you had to do. If you were in solid with the clerical staff, you didn‘t need to worry about the inspectors; they loved a guy that kept the rank and file happy. Polanski was a real knockout, and most of the guys in the Embassy would like to be as friendly with her as he was, but with him it was strictly policy; that kind of dame was poison. He would stick with dames like Smedley over in USIS. She was old enough to know what it was all about, and homely enough to be plenty grateful. They all looked the same in the dark, anyway.</p>
   <p>Behind him, Anita Polanski watched as he went down the hall, turned in at the ICA suite.</p>
   <p>“You corny bastard,” she said aloud.</p>
   <subtitle>2</subtitle>
   <p>Behind his massive desk in the ICA suite, Deputy Counsellor of Embassy Fred Chalmers tapped a slim cigar against an embossed silver ashtray, staring at Feinstein. “So the matter is to be glossed over, Mickey. I might have expected as much. I sometimes wonder, Mickey, who I endure it. Why did Bradley Paine come here to make excuses for the blackguard, plead that the man had been drinking, hadn‘t known what he was doing, that now he regrets his temerity?”</p>
   <p>Mickey Feinstein shook heavy jowls, shifted in his chair.</p>
   <p>“Certainly the scoundrel was drunk,” Chalmers continued. “How else would he have dared to strike me? It was as though a common soldier dealt a blow to his general, and went scot free. But it‘s typical, Mickey. The Diplomatic Service is decadent, proletarianized, no longer a place for a gentleman.”</p>
   <p>“You got a point there, Fred,” Feinstein said.</p>
   <p>“In offering one‘s services, one assumes that one‘s social contacts would be with people of one‘s own class. Instead one is equated with common roughnecks; the result—assault and battery.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, you know what I mean?” Mickey said.</p>
   <p>“Very well, I shall do as Bradley Paine asked; my sense of duty to the nation outweighs even pride. But you may rest assured, Mickey—the next time one of these young doxies flaunts her hips at me, she neednt expect that I will descend to her plane to democratically enter the spirit of the occasion. Such persons consider it sport to maneuver one into such a situation and then use it as an excuse—</p>
   <p>A muted tone sounded from the intercommunicator. “Mr. Hurd wishes to see you, sir … ”</p>
   <p>“Hurd? That gawky bucolic from the Administrative Section?” Fred stared at Mickey.</p>
   <p>“What does Hurd want with me? I have no business with the fellow. Must I be interrupted at my work by every Tom, Dick and Harry in this Embassy? But this is a part of the pattern; no help for it . . . I‘ll see Mr. Hurd. Get out, Mickey.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, I got to run along, Fred.”</p>
   <p>Hurd came in, pulled out a chair and dropped into<emphasis> it. </emphasis>He lit a cigarette, and blew smoke carelessly across the desk.</p>
   <p>“What I wanted to see you about, Mr. Chalmers, I and Mr. Sutton want to express how sorry we are about this boy Bayard pulling what he did. We want you to know this kind of thing isn‘t something the Admin Section and Personnel don‘t intend to do something about.”</p>
   <p>“I should think not,” Chalmers said. It was interesting that someone in the Embassy had the decency to feel some embarrassment over the affair. Perhaps Hurd meant well, in spite of his lack of polish . . .</p>
   <p>“Of course, we got to go through channels. It takes time. But we‘re opening a special file on this boy, and when we got enough on him—well fix his wagon. So Mr. Chalmers, if you want to just give me a statement about how he shoved you …</p>
   <p>“Shoved! The man struck me! I have a bruise the size of a silver dollar … ”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>After Tom had left, Fred sat thinking. How fortunate it was that he had not judged Hurd hastily. It was important to remember that honest, good-hearted persons could be found even among the unlettered. One had to rely at times on strange allies.</p>
   <p>There were so few persons in the Embassy who showed breeding. The young lady, Miss Anita Polanski, was one. Oh, he was no snob; he recognized and admired refinement wherever it might appear. Miss Polanski came of immigrant stock perhaps, but she conducted herself as a lady should. He had always made it a point to return her courtesy.</p>
   <p>And she was such an aristocratic appearing person; so well groomed, and of course, handsomely formed. Yes, very handsomely formed. It would be rather pleasant to invite her to dine with him some evening, merely as a gracious gesture. But that was a mere fancy . . . . It would be ghastly if she refused.</p>
   <p>The telephone sounded softly. Why didn‘t the girls in the outer office fend off these people who were eternally wanting to take up his time? Did they imagine he had nothing better to do?</p>
   <p>He picked up the telephone. The abrupt voice of Harvey Throst; General Winjee was on his way up to Throst‘s office. Could Fred find time to drop over, just by accident, in about five minutes?</p>
   <p>Fred replaced the receiver grumpily. They should handle these details through Mickey. His time was best devoted to policy matters, not games of hide-and-seek with petty local officials. Of course, Winjee was Chief of the Combined Staffs, but with a military establishment of ten thousand men, that was an empty dignity. Still, he would have to play along. Five minutes, Throst had said . . .</p>
   <subtitle>3</subtitle>
   <p>Anita Polanski glanced down the corridor, then opened a compact and checked her makeup. It was OK. She knew it would be. God knows nothing had happened to smear it.</p>
   <p>Where had she gotten the idea an Embassy would be a glamourous place, where a girl would meet a lot of high class men? It was just like any other office back home. You saw the same old types. Men were the same everywhere. The nice-looking ones, like that new fellow, Bayard; they never gave her a second look. And damned old goats like Tom Hurd—God, he was no different than the men that used to hang around the store, back in Caney. None of the really nice men paid any attention to her—except Mr. Chalmers. He always stopped and hemmed and hawed and shot his cuffs and told her it was a nice day. Why didnt he come out with it some time—say what he was thinking? She knew what he needed, all right. It might be kind of a kick to take the old boy up on it . . .</p>
   <p>Anita watched as Tom Hurd came out into the hall and walked toward her, looking pleased with himself. He winked at her.</p>
   <p>“See you next time, sugar,” he said breezily.</p>
   <p>“Hurry back, Mr. Hurd,” Anita said warmly. And I hope you break a leg, she added silently.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Anita took out a nail-file and brushed at a fingernail. She looked up at the sound of an opening door. Mr. Chalmers was coming along the hall. She dropped the nail-file in her lap and raised her arm to touch her hair, turning just enough to silhouette her bust line. She smiled sweetly at Chalmers.</p>
   <p>“Good afternoon, sir,” Anita said softly.</p>
   <p>“Hello, Miss Polanski. Rather a warm afternoon, isn‘t it?” Fred‘s eyes darted over her figure. She was an extremely handsome young woman. Extremely well-formed. How ap-pealingly unconscious of her feminine attraction she was. She would look magnificent in a formal dinner gown, sitting across from him at a table laid with linen, silver, and crystal, with soft lights, and he would lean across to pour her wine . . .</p>
   <p>“It<emphasis> is</emphasis> awfully warm, isn‘t it,” Anita cooed. “Sometimes I wish I could just slip off all my clothes . . . but that‘s a secret I wouldn‘t tell anyone but you, Mr. Chalmers. I hope you don‘t think I‘m awful … ”</p>
   <p>“Awful! As a matter of fact, Miss Polanski . . . I . . . I wonder if you might be free some evening. I would like you to dine with me … ”</p>
   <p>Miss Polanski‘s eyes grew round. Fred swallowed. He had shocked her. She would be angry . . . .</p>
   <p>“I can‘t think of anything that would be nicer, Mr. Chalmers.”</p>
   <p>“Why, that‘s wonderful. And please . . . call me Fred . . . Anita.”</p>
   <p>“When do you want me, Fred?”</p>
   <p>“Why, soon, tonight. Are you free tonight?”</p>
   <p>“Tonight would be wonderful.”</p>
   <p>“I‘ll send a car for you. About seven thirty?”</p>
   <p>“I‘ll be ready.”</p>
   <p>Fred beamed, backed, ducked his head as he went through the door.</p>
   <p>Well, Freddy, Anita thought. You little rascal . . .</p>
   <subtitle>4</subtitle>
   <p>Winjee was clever enough, Colonel Harvey Throst reflected, to understand that the Army Attache was his real ally in clinching the police equipment deal. As for Chalmers, he had no ideas of his own on the subject; he was glad to follow the advice of a military expert. All he was interested in was his party planning. Winjee would see how effective Throst was in action, pushing the deal with Fred. Then, when the agreement was signed, and the armored cars and riot guns were delivered, Winjee would make his move, and the junta would take over. With Chaw‘s party out of the way, Winjee would line Samoy up with the west, crack down on the Communists, and the U.S. would have gained an ally. And for his part of the deal, Winjee would ask for a MAAG mission, and request that Colonel Harvey Throst, a proven friend of Samoy, head it. It was simple and foolproof. He was covered in the record all the way. His main objective, of course, was not the personal one, but the good of the United States. To throw out the crew of fence-sitters who played both sides for all they could gouge and lined their pockets with the take—that was clearly a patriotic act. And he had to do it alone, because the State boys would never commit themselves to any decisive action—they were a gutless pack. People at home spent a lot of time complaining about U.S. Foreign Policy; couldnt they see that the policy would be as cowardly as the men who made it?</p>
   <p>But the State boys outsmarted themselves when they discounted Harvey Throst. They would look pretty foolish over in the Chancery, the morning after the blow-up; but the Army Attache would come up smelling like a rose. His reports were all there—buried in their files—ignored. Meanwhile, he had to baby this police equipment thing along, keep Chalmers happy.</p>
   <p>It was pleasanter to think about Ruth. There was a really fine woman. She didn‘t seem to fit in with the rest of the State bunch. She had a lot of poise, that girl did. She knew what Bert was up to, but she stood there and took it with a smile. It was a dirty shame. Still, that angle didn‘t hurt things any, from Harvey Throst‘s point of view. A woman whose husband was running around appreciated a friend . . .</p>
   <p>He heard a step and Winjee walked into the room, smiling broadly. Harvey jumped up.</p>
   <p>“Well, how are you, General? Good to see you, sir. Have a chair.” Flatter the little devil, give him a cigar. What was keeping Chalmers?</p>
   <subtitle>5</subtitle>
   <p>Pushing a grocery cart in the Embassy Commissary, Marie Cummins smiled when she saw Ruth Sutton.</p>
   <p>“Hello, dear,” Ruth said. “Did you get over to that flower-arranging thing this morning? I said to hell with it and slept late.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, yes. It was nice. Mrs. Oshaki said I was getting a real Japanese feeling.” If Ruth only knew, Marie thought, how she hated that silly business of sticking flowers and twigs in a dish . . . . It was easy for Ruth; she was high enough that she could stay away when she felt like it; but if a junior officer‘s wife missed one of these things that Mrs. MacWaithe sponsored . . .</p>
   <p>“Would you like a lift home?” Ruth was asking.</p>
   <p>“Oh . . . no thank you, Ruth . . . I want to stay and see Henry . . . about something we have to order. But thanks anyway.”</p>
   <p>Ruth went on and Marie moved slowly along to the mushroom, asparagus tip and caviar counter, where she could see the entry. She wished Ruth would hurry up and check her groceries and leave, before—. Why had she said that about meeting Henry? Now she had to live up to it, or look like it, anyway.</p>
   <p>Marie added some cans to her selections, dawdled over the maraschino cherries and the tuna. She glanced toward the checkout counter. Ruth was not in sight. That was a relief. There wasn‘t really anything to hide, of course. There wasn‘t anything wrong with talking to Mr. Paine in the commissary. He might not even come. It was silly, just because he usually came down on Wednesday afternoons . . .</p>
   <p>But it would be nice if he would. It was nice to talk to a real gentleman like Bradley Paine. He was always friendly and she was sure he liked her. And as long as there were men like Mr. Sutton and Mr. Chalmers waiting to pounce every time they got her cornered at a party, it was good to have a friend as important as Mr. Paine. Henry was too busy with his own problems to worry about her. She would have to look out for herself. If things ever got really bad, she could go to Mr. Paine for help.</p>
   <subtitle>6</subtitle>
   <p>Bradley Paine pressed his fingers to his temples. It had been a trying day. He glanced at his watch. Time to go down to do his weekly shopping. He detested the chore, but it seemed to please people to see him there, so prosaically occupied; it helped morale. And if he dispatched one of the girls to do it, it would have the opposite effect; they would begin to talk about special service. And popularity with the staff was important, even to the Deputy Chief.</p>
   <p>He closed the safe file, told the girls he was leaving for the day, and left the office. The blonde girl with the bedroom eyes gazed at him as he passed her desk in the hall, cooed her usual greeting. She didn‘t appeal to him; he must be getting old. It was unfortunate that age had not affected Chalmers in the same way.</p>
   <p>And the interview with that pompous young jackanapes Chaw had sent over from the Ministry with the draft Mining Law; preposterous! It was an affront to the Embassy that Chaw would employ an ignoramus of that stripe to make a presentation to the American Counsellor. And the draft had been a hodge-podge. They had edited all the sense out of the suggested text he had sent over. They were boys, playing at a man‘s game. Why the Department had ever elevated the consulate General in Samoy to Embassy level he could not fathom.</p>
   <p>Chaw and his clique were clever enough at one trick, though; the playing-off of one side against the other. Chaw had had plenty of practice; he had started out back at the beginning of the war, wrangling handsome appropriations from the British for equipping the Samoyan Home Guard—funds which he himself administered. The Guard, notably unequipped, had gone over to the Japanese four days before the first troops crossed the border.</p>
   <p>Chaw had next popped up as Minister of Information in the Japanese puppet government. At war‘s end, Chaw had exonerated himself from charges of collaboration by presenting proof that he had systematically drained off Japanese funds while stalling on the propaganda program.</p>
   <p>Now he was Deputy Prime Minister in the Government of the Republic of Samoy—and still at it. The mining law was designed to channel money into Chaws holdings as much as for anything else. The man was too short-sighted to consider the consequences of a Communist coup seriously. When that happened, he would lose it all, and his life along with it.</p>
   <p>Paine made his way past the knot of Embassy wives gossiping by the bulletin board, took a cart It was a blessing that the cook got most of the provender from the bazaar. He had only to fill in with the stateside items unavailable locally.</p>
   <p>Little Mrs. Cummins was hesitating over a can of smoked oysters; no doubt she found it necessary to exercise caution in shopping; the only thing that was cheap in the commissary was liquor. Baby food was fifty cents or so a bottle; a pity the little ones couldn‘t thrive on a diet of economical scotch.</p>
   <p>She was certainly a pretty little creature. It was understandable that Fred had been attracted to her. At the same time, it was a pity. She was much too sensitive a young woman to cope with Chalmers. Bayard had done the right thing. Too bad he hadn‘t done it more gracefully.</p>
   <p>Bradley Paine watched Marie as she moved slowly along in his direction, absorbed in her shopping. She looked up as she came up to him and smiled brightly. She had immense eyes with long lashes, a tender pink mouth. Her brown hair was cut short in one of those modern styles. She was a lovely little thing . . . .</p>
   <p>“Well, Marie. It‘s worth the burden of pushing this cart just to encounter your charming presence.” He would like to say something about last night, apologize for Fred; but, of course, it wouldn‘t do . . .</p>
   <p>“I like to see you pushing a cart, Mr. Paine. It gives us something in common … ”</p>
   <p>Paine laughed. “Anything that gives an old man something in common with a pretty girl is a good thing,” he said.</p>
   <p>“You‘re not a bit old, Mr. Paine. You‘re just at the most attractive age.”</p>
   <p>How fortunate, Bradley Paine thought, to encounter Marie here. It made the chore of shopping a pleasure.</p>
   <p>They moved along the aisle together, laughing and talking.</p>

   <p>. . . We were at a table on the terrace at Kuan Li and Ingred”s brother, who managed the SAS office, came over and introduced Greta, a secretary from the West German Legation; they sat down and we ordered another drink all around. The girls started right in exchanging shopping tips, and Lars tried to interest me in a tiger hunt.</p>
   <p>“You ought to come along, Brion,” he said. “This Anglo chap Howard is a great expert in this sort of thing. He‘s taking us along to a spot where he says we‘re sure to see the big ones.”</p>
   <p>“Count me out, Lars,” I said. “I prefer to sit around and drink while you young fellows have the adventures.”</p>
   <p>“Don‘t worry, we‘ll do plenty of drinking. Howard recommends a canteen well-filled with scotch at all times.”</p>
   <p>“Besides,” I said, “I don‘t own a rifle.”</p>
   <p>Lars opened his mouth—</p>
   <p>“And I don‘t want to borrow one,” I added.</p>
   <p>“I‘ll bring you back a skin,” Lars said. “Then you‘ll catch the spirit.”</p>
   <p>“I hope not,” I said.</p>
   <p>The band started up and Lars and Greta jumped up and moved out onto the floor. Ingred watched them. She looked serious.</p>
   <p>“Brion,” she said. “I am worried about Lars. He is such a foolish boy.”</p>
   <p>“Hey, that‘s no way to talk about the manager of an airline,” I said.</p>
   <p>“Some of the people who come to see him at the office—I dont like them. There is a horrid Indian gentleman named Dasgupta. I am sure he is some kind of criminal—</p>
   <p>“What makes you think so?”</p>
   <p>“It is the type. I know he is having a bad influence. Lars is so . . . so casual, so . . . I do not know the word in English. He is not serious.”</p>
   <p>“He‘s lucky,” I said. “I‘m serious, and look at me.”</p>
   <p>“You are not serious, either; but it is different.”</p>
   <p>“He‘s over twenty-one,” I said. “He can take care of himself.”</p>
   <p>“If I thought that,” Ingred said, “I would not now be here in Samoy.”</p>
   <p>“Then I‘m glad you don‘t think that,” I said. “If you weren‘t here, Samoy would be a hell of a place.”</p>
   <p>“And if you were not here to tell me I am a foolish woman, I would be even more worried,” Ingred said. She smiled.</p>
   <p>“Never stay worried too long at a time,” I said. “That‘s the secret.”</p>
   <p>“Now dance with me, and I will not worry at all.”</p>
   <p>We went out on the floor, and it was almost cool now in the evening, and the band wasn‘t too bad, playing from a distance behind a screen, and the moon was on the lake, and Ingred was light as a feather and smelled like spring flowers, and for a while both of us forgot about worrying.</p>
   <subtitle>2</subtitle>
   <p>Bert Sutton pulled to a stop in front of the Cummins house; pretty neat, borrowing Henry‘s car for this errand. A light showed in the downstairs hall and another upstairs. This was the break he had been waiting for for the last month, but somehow there always seemed to be something getting in the way. If he didn‘t know Marie better, he might almost think she had been deliberately avoiding him; but that was ridiculous …</p>
   <p>Maybe she had stayed home this evening in hopes that he would come over. That might be it; she was a sharp little cookie. What could be more natural than that the host, concerned over a guest‘s welfare, should come around in person to urge his hospitality? If that was the story . . .</p>
   <p>Bert went up the walk, glancing at the nearby houses for evidence of prying eyes. Inside, it was very still. He wondered whether he should call, or—</p>
   <subtitle>3</subtitle>
   <p>In the darkened living room, a startled house servant looked up, dropped a cigarette box and two loose cigarettes on the coffee table, and began to dust vigorously toward the door. Bert called to him.</p>
   <p>“Boy! Is Memsah‘b at home?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, sah. Memsah‘b coming now, sah.”</p>
   <p>“Is Memsah‘b asleep?”</p>
   <p>“Memsah‘b not sleeping, sah.”</p>
   <p>There was a sound on the stair. “Tunmong? Who‘s there?”</p>
   <p>“Marie!” Bert said, coming into the hall. “I was so sorry to hear you weren‘t feeling well. I just dropped by to see if I couldn‘t prevail on you to join us. Maybe a drive—</p>
   <p>“Why, Mr. Sutton … “ In the dim light Bert could see that Marie was dressed, her hair done, make-up . . .</p>
   <p>“Why, Marie, I thought we‘d passed the ‘Mr.‘ stage a long time ago.”</p>
   <p>Marie came down the stairs slowly.</p>
   <p>“When Henry said you weren‘t feeling well, I had an idea you might feel like a little quiet company. I hate to think of you all alone here in this gloomy old house.”</p>
   <p>“That‘s very thoughtful of you, Bert, but I really didn‘t . . . I mean I just thought I‘d go to bed early. You shouldn‘t have gone to any trouble on my account.”</p>
   <p>“It‘s no trouble, Marie. I know how it is to want company. Sometimes I just have to get out myself and see somebody new—you know; the same old faces all the time …</p>
   <p>Marie came down the last two steps. She was wearing a strapless dress with a flouncy skirt, and she had a flower in her hair. She didn‘t dress like that for a nap; or for Henry either, Bert thought. He had it made.</p>
   <p>“Or would you rather go for a drive?” Bert said smoothly, taking Marie‘s hand. “It‘s a lovely night for it.”</p>
   <p>Marie drew her hand away and went past Bert into the living room.</p>
   <p>“I‘m sorry, Bert, but I really would like to be alone. I don‘t feel like seeing anyone now. I‘m just about to go up to bed.”</p>
   <p>“Well, I‘d be glad to tuck you in … “ Bert chuckled. “Seriously,” he went on, “I know a little place where we can get a really wonderful rice wine, and listen to some good records. It‘s just what you need.”</p>
   <p>“Bert, you‘ll have to excuse me. I have to feed the baby now, and then I have to get some sleep—</p>
   <p>“Can‘t the nanny feed the baby?”</p>
   <p>Marie blushed. “Dennie isn‘t a bottle baby.”</p>
   <p>Bert smiled broadly. “Well, Marie, go right ahead. I assure you I don‘t mind in the least.”</p>
   <p>Potu appeared in the hall holding Dennie.</p>
   <p>“Time for little mahster‘s tiffin,” she said, giggling. She came into the room and put the baby in Marie‘s arms.</p>
   <p>In the darkened living room at the Sutton residence, the first reel of the evening‘s movie ended, and Henry Cummins blinked in the sudden light from the lamp beside the projector. Ruth Sutton took a cigarette from the box on the table. Krishna appeared, passing fresh bowls of pop corn.</p>
   <p>“Why in the world did you pop all this corn, Krishna?” Ruth said. “There are just two of us here to eat it.” She looked at Henry, smiling wearily. “Of course, there‘ll be just that much more left over for Krishna to take home.”</p>
   <p>‘Too bad Bert isn‘t back yet,” Henry said. “He‘s missing a good picture.”</p>
   <p>“That<emphasis> is</emphasis> a pity,” Ruth said.</p>
   <p>The telephone rang. Ruth sat erect. Who would be calling just now? Maybe . . . She rose, made her way around the projector and past Henry‘s chair and into the hall. Perhaps</p>
   <p>“Hello … ”</p>
   <p>“Ruth! Harvey here. Say, I just got to wondering if you and Bert might be free—</p>
   <p>“Why the sudden interest in Bert?”</p>
   <p>“You know my interest in Bert,” Harvey said. “Just observing form—</p>
   <p>“As it happens, Bert is tied up. But I‘m free as a bird.”</p>
   <p>There was a pause. “Ruth darlin‘,” Harvey said, “I‘ll be right over.”</p>
   <p>“Never mind,” Ruth said. She waited a long moment</p>
   <p>“I‘m coming over to your place.”</p>
   <subtitle>4</subtitle>
   <p>Bert stood on the walk before the Cummins house and stared at the closed door. He could feel his pulse pounding just above his ears; his teeth were clenched together so hard they hurt. She had actually kicked him out! In another minute she would have made a scene. He knew the signs; she wasn‘t faking. And after she had as much as invited him over—and then practically stripped to the waist while he watched . . . Bert drew a deep breath and swallowed.</p>
   <p>Damn the girl! Did she think she could play games with Bert Suttton, an FSO-3? Her, the wife of a miserable FSO-8? Had she been stringing him along all these weeks just for kicks?</p>
   <p>Bert glanced at the neighboring windows and moved on down the other side of the street. Bert squinted across at it. It looked like the Deputy Chiefs car. There was no one in it but the local driver. What was Paine‘s car doing here? He wasn‘t at the Lewises‘ or Zwickers‘; there were no lights on downstairs, and the car would be in the drive; there was plenty of room. What was going on?</p>
   <p>Bert started his car and moved off down the street to the gate of the compound, pulled over. He lit a cigarette and watched the rear view mirror. Five minutes passed.</p>
   <p>There was a movement, dim light as a front door opened and shut. Then a figure crossed the street to the big sedan. The driver jumped out, opened the door for his passenger. A moment later it started up, eased away from the curb. As it passed, Bert caught a glimpse of Marie Cummins sitting alone in the back seat.</p>
   <subtitle>5</subtitle>
   <p>Potoke drew the car up to the side entrance of the house as instructed, and jumped out to open the door. The little memsah‘b stepped out, murmured a word and passed on inside. She was a pretty plaything; Potoke stared after her, wrinkling his nose to catch another trace of the flower-smell that all the master-women carried. Perhaps, when the Day came . . .</p>
   <p>He parked the car, locked the door, and walked toward the quarters behind the Big House. Little Tiger would be very angry that he was coming late, but how could he help it? But the Chinaman had best not curse him again; Potoke could be pressed too far.</p>
   <p>A slight figure rose up before him. “Son of a dog!” hissed the accented voice of Little Tiger. “Do we gather here to wait while you mount your mother—</p>
   <p>“It was not my fault. Number two Master takes a concubine; can I help if I am go-between—</p>
   <p>“Get to your place, eater-of-offal. I have important instructions from our brothers in the North.”</p>
   <p>Potoke squatted beside Bajee, the Zwickers‘ bearer, in his accustomed place. Little Tiger had not been nearly so angry as he had expected. Maybe he was getting old. Maybe now there would be more of sport and jolly tricks—like knocking Indian merchants in the head to get money for the Party, and for a little whiskey too—and not so much abusing of honest patriots like Potoke: Little Tiger was as bad as the masters—or worse. But if he was getting soft, maybe Potoke could get a knife into him, and be boss; the others would like to have a good fellow like Potoke in charge. And then when the Day came, he would have first choice of loot and women. He would take the little Memsahb first, then the—</p>
   <p>“Potoke! Take thy head from out thy anus! Have you stolen the keys as you were ordered? If not, thy precious master will be seeking a new pimp … ”</p>
   <p>Potoke fumbled the keys from under his skirt and handed them over sullenly. Little Tiger went too far when he cast slurs on Potoke‘s thieving ability. Was he not a Thief and the son of a Thief and the grandson of a Thief? And who was this Chinaman to abuse Samoyans on Samoyan soil? He was not so great a man that Potoke must bow down to him. Some day . . .</p>
   <p>“Potoke,” Bajee said softly beside him. “You told me you were a Big Man here. I think maybe you are only a coolie for the Chinaman.” Bajee stared at Potoke solemnly and puffed on his cheroot.</p>
   <p>“You wait,” Potoke hissed. “I will show this Little Tiger he is only a stray cat after all.”</p>
   <p>“You do this now?”</p>
   <p>“Not now; later; when the time is right.”</p>
   <p>“Meantime, you are still coolie.” Bajee nodded, chuckling, and turned away.</p>
   <p>Potoke squinted at Little Tiger, still jabbering of incomprehensible things to those who would listen. Yes, Great Chinaman; you push Potoke too far . . .</p>

   <p>It had been a long meeting. Leaving Bradley Paine‘s office, Fred Chalmers escorted Chaw and Winjee to the elevator, then went down the hall to the ICA suite. Behind his desk, he leaned back and steepled his fingers, a look of contentment on his face.</p>
   <p>The door opened, and Anita Polanski came in. She closed the door quietly, crossed the room to the desk, leaned far over its wide expanse, and kissed Fred firmly.</p>
   <p>“Did you call, sir?” she said. She got a kick out of Freddie, the way he tried not to look like he was looking down the front of her dress. Did men really think a girl didn‘t know when she was showing a little something extra?</p>
   <p>“Nita, my dear. How lovely you are.” Fred‘s hand moved tentatively toward her, and Anita straightened. It seemed kind of unnatural to be so prudish, but she knew better than to let things get ahead of themselves. After they were really married would be time enough. Meanwhile, she just didn‘t want Freddie to lose interest. Look, but don‘t touch . . .</p>
   <p>“What a relief, Nita, to have the confounded Project Agreement signed at last. Winjee has made his headquarters in my office for the last week, it seems, with his eternal jockeying about and juggling of clauses … ”</p>
   <p>“Poor Freddie.”</p>
   <p>“I just have a little classified memo, Nita; to all Section heads and the service attaches.” Fred cleared his throat. “Classification Secret,” he said. He dictated slowly:</p>
   <p>“The initial Project agreement under the current ICA loan, providing for the supply to the Samoyan government of Police Equipment to a value of eight million, three hundred and twenty-one thousand dollars, was signed today. The items supplied will include armored cars, half-tracks, mortars, rockets, grenades, and small arms, including automatic rifles and thirty-calibre machine guns. Shipment from Japan will commence immediately.”</p>
   <p>“Got it,” Anita said. Freddie had been real surprised that she really could take dictation. Wasn‘t it sweet of him to get her transferred out of the hall, even when he didn‘t really think she was a good steno?</p>
   <p>“About seven tonight?” Fred said.</p>
   <p>“I‘ll be ready.” Freddy really was sweet. It was going to be real nice, being married to him. And she‘d be a real wife to him, too. No stepping out for her. There weren‘t many kicks left in that line she didn‘t already know. And wouldn‘t it be fun showing them to Freddy.</p>
   <subtitle>2</subtitle>
   <p>Bert Sutton leaned back in his chair, watching Henry Cummins sitting there with sweat beading his forehead.</p>
   <p>“Cummins, what I have to say to you is a pretty difficult thing to say to a man.” Bert narrowed his eyes ominously. “Nevertheless, I‘m going to say it. I‘ve never been a man to allow niceties to interfere with the performance of duty.”</p>
   <p>Bert watched Cummins swallow. It was amusing, watching him wonder what was coming. As far as Cummins knew it could be anything; dismissal, disgrace, ruin. Bert had the power to inflict any of these things on him, and Cummins never knew at what moment he might choose to exercise that power.</p>
   <p>“Henry, I‘ve gone out of my way from the beginning to try to head off what I saw coming. In spite of my efforts, I‘ve failed.”</p>
   <p>Cummins swallowed again, said nothing.</p>
   <p>“You may have the idea, or Marie, that no one is aware of what‘s been going on.” Bert smiled grimly. “I assure you that you‘re mistaken. It‘s common knowledge. And I can‘t ignore it any longer.”</p>
   <p>Henry sat up in his chair. “What is it, Bert? What are you getting at … ”</p>
   <p>Well; Henry was showing a little life. But he‘d wipe the arrogance off his face for him . . .</p>
   <p>“I‘m talking about open and notorious cohabitation, that‘s what I‘m talking about, Cummins.” Bert leaned across the table. “Your wife—</p>
   <p>Henry was on his feet, his fists doubled.</p>
   <p>“You‘re a liar, Sutton! What are you trying to do to me? Why are you trying to drag Marie into it?”</p>
   <p>Bert‘s lip curled. “Rest assured that I rejected Marie‘s advances—</p>
   <p>There was a sudden motion, and an explosive shock, lights whirling. The floor was sloping, and Bert scrambled for footing . . .</p>
   <p>He was lying on the floor, his overturned chair beside him. His head was ringing, and Henry Cummins stood over him, eyes glaring. Good God! He had gone too far . . . . Henry hadn‘t swallowed it, he had hit him, and now he would go to Paine with the story . . . . Christ! Why hadn‘t he foreseen this, held back. He sat up, breathing hard. Why didn‘t Mabel come in, fend the maniac off . . . . Damn the sound-proofing!</p>
   <p>“Henry . . . wait … “ He scrambled back. He was sick. The pain . . . but he had to plead with Henry, remind him of what a good friend he had been, the favors he could do him . . .</p>
   <p>“Bert, my God,” Henry said. “I don‘t know what made me do it. I swear I don‘t know what came over me. I didn‘t mean it … ”</p>
   <p>Bert looked up at Henry, blinking. What? What was he saying?</p>
   <p>“I‘ll do anything, Bert. I was out of my mind, finding out about Marie like that … ”</p>
   <p>All right, Bert. Play them close to your chest now. It wasn‘t all shot yet. He could bring it around, even with an aching jaw. He got to his feet, straightened his coat.</p>
   <p>“Forget it, Henry. Sit down, boy. I‘m sorry myself. Breaking it to you like that, I guess I had it coming.”</p>
   <p>“Jesus, Bert.” Henry‘s voice was broken. He groped his way to his chair. “What should I do? Tell me what to do, Bert.”</p>
   <p>“We have to handle this carefully, Henry. So far there‘s been no public notice taken. We can still smooth it over. Don‘t take it so hard. These things happen. And after all, maybe she was doing it for your career … ”</p>
   <p>“My career! God!”</p>
   <p>“It happens that way. A girl will go a long way to try to influence her husband‘s superiors—that was what I was trying to tell you, when you . . . well, lost control.</p>
   <p>“You mean she . . . that Marie … ”</p>
   <p>Bert nodded solemnly. This was good. Hit Bert Sutton, would he? He‘d put it right in his eye.</p>
   <p>“She . . . offered herself to me if I would give you a favorable E.R. Naturally, I . . . well, I tried to pretend I didn‘t understand. I tried to counsel her, steer her into healthier channels of thinking. It was no use. She went . . . well, over my head.”</p>
   <p>“Who … ”</p>
   <p>“Don‘t try to find out who is involved. It‘s far better if you don‘t. You might take some hasty action that you‘d regret the rest of your life.”</p>
   <p>“What . . . What do you advise, Bert?”</p>
   <p>“All right, Henry, since you ask.” Sutton leaned toward Henry. “Here‘s what I want you to do . . . .”</p>
   <subtitle>3</subtitle>
   <p>Colonel Harvey Throst glanced at the memo the ICA messenger had just brought over, tossed it in his OUT basket. After all these months they had finally signed the agreement on the police equipment. Well, so much for that. It didn‘t seem important now. The whole rat-race seemed trivial after last night.</p>
   <p>Harvey looked at the office around him, frowning at the framed commission on the wall, the papers in the baskets. Was this the effect of being in love? All the old cliches seemed to fit. And he was the wise guy who thought he had it all under control; he was playing it light, just out for a few laughs, nothing serious. She was a neglected wife, a little past her prime; a perfect set-up; and he was the smooth operator who was going to rack up another score. Well, maybe it hadn‘t been quite that off-hand; Ruth was a damn fine gal, he had seen that from the first. But if she knew what kind of conniving rung-climber he really was . . .</p>
   <p>Why the hell did he have to start being self-critical now? Couldn‘t he fall in love with a woman without putting on sackcloth and ashes? She seemed to like him OK the way he was; why should he be dissatisfied? But the way she had looked at him last night when she reached up and loosened her hair, and then tossed her head, and that jet-black cascade fell loose and free. Why did she always wear it drawn back? It was so damn beautiful. And the way she walked, barefoot, and stood there before him . . .</p>
   <p>But he had work to do; he still had a career to keep afloat. If he was going to be as nuts about Ruth as it looked now, it was no time to get starry-eyed; he had more reason than ever to go for broke. A woman like Ruth had to have the best. Throst retrieved Chalmers‘ memo from the basket, read it again. All right; now that the agreement was signed, the arms would be here within a couple of weeks. Once he had the stuff, Winjee would be ready to step in as soon as the Commies made their move, about April first, on a local holiday, probably, or a date the astrologers picked. That equipment better not be delayed now, or it could get here late. Of course, Winjee could probably handle the Commies without the stuff, but that wouldn‘t do Harvey Throst much good. The whole point was for Harvey to be the fair-haired boy who had pushed the arms deal through in the nick of time.</p>
   <p>It was too bad he hadn‘t been able to get a line into Commie HQ like he had to Winjee‘s office. It would be nice to know just what the Reds had in mind. But Winjee‘s men had done pretty well; at least, they knew the approximate date of the riots that would signal the kick-off. The Reds would be surprised as hell when old Winjee stopped them cold, declared martial law, and took over. He hoped Winjee wouldn‘t be too rough on the P.M. and the cabinet ministers, but out here in the East, the boys played rough. Well, that was their lookout Meanwhile, he had to do all he could to expedite shipment of the stuff. Fortunately, he had a few connections in Tokyo. He‘d get Nagler to fly him up this week-end. Maybe Ruth would like to get away for a few days. Say, that was a terrific idea! What more could a man ask than a girl like Ruth and a town like Tokyo? What a weekend that would be. But with Ruth, you didn‘t need a party town. Just a simple little house on a side street in any old town would be plenty. Too damn bad he had to spend his time pulling strings, scrambling for what he could grab, instead of just hiking out in the hills somewhere with Ruth, and saying to hell with the whole lousy mess . . .</p>
   <subtitle>4</subtitle>
   <p>Sitting at the Embassy snack-bar smiling gently at the hand-painted illustrations of a curry puff and Coca-Cola, two cots, Bert Sutton finished his coffee and lit a cigarette. He looked at his watch. Ten-fifteen. He would have to get back up to the office in a few minutes. It had been a busy morning—and he had more work to do. He was feeling great, except for the sore jaw. Henrys jumping him and the neat way hed handled it was another proof of the rule Bert had formulated a long time ago: To get what you wanted, you had to keep the goal constantly in mind, no matter what turn events took. Like last night; he had missed the boat—but as soon as he saw that it wasnt the precise situation he had thought, that Brad Paine was in the picture—he had merely adjusted his plans accordingly.</p>
   <p>Then Henry had changed the script when he hit him. That hadn‘t been what he had expected of Henry, but he had switched tactics again, used the assault to set up tonight‘s meeting. Instead of putting it to Henry plainly, as he had planned, he would keep him in the dark, and then tonight—he would point out the consequences of non-cooperation to Marie; and it wasnt as though she were some spotless little wife; he was just asking for his share of what was being passed out.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Feinstein came up to the counter beside him, ordered a Coca-Cola.</p>
   <p>“Hi, Eve,” Bert said cheerfully. “Did you and Ruth get your plans all cooked up last night?”</p>
   <p>“What‘s that, Bert?”</p>
   <p>“I was just asking if you and Ruth got your party arrangements set up OK. Ruth mentioned she got with you on that last night.”</p>
   <p>“You must be mistaken, Bert. That‘s tonight we have the meeting.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, sure. I guess that‘s it. Anyway, it‘s in capable hands.”</p>
   <p>Funny; he was sure Ruth had said she got a hurry-up call from Eve Feinstein last night; that was why she went off and left Henry alone. Bert smiled. Henry, sitting there in the dark . . .</p>
   <p>That was like Ruth, mentioning the wrong name carelessly, unconcerned about the embarrassment it might cause him. She had no regard for his career at all. If Ruth only knew how meticulously her husband planned every detail, leaving nothing to chance . . . . But that was Ruth, wrapped up in her club activities, smug and content. What a petty range of interest she had. That was why she was middle-aged, dull, while he was still in his prime.</p>
   <p>And now it was time to proceed with the matter of Bayard‘s training . . . .</p>
   <subtitle>5</subtitle>
   <p>. . . when I got the message that Sutton had called me again, my first impulse was to go down and give him the punch in the jaw he had been asking for; then I reminded myself that there were some other considerations that had nothing to do with how badly Sutton needed that punch. The real trouble was that there was a lot I didn‘t understand about the mechanics of the Foreign Service Way. It wasn‘t like the Army, and it wasn‘t like the Civil Service; there was something about the isolation, out from under the eye of the Department and the public, a few people thrown together every day and every night, some of them holding the whip hand, and all of them with their eye on the goodies that went with die next rung in the ladder.</p>
   <p>War, which was professional killing, had the effect of brutalizing men. There were plenty of combat soldiers who had been quiet boys at home who looted and raped when they got the chance between turns on the lines. Diplomacy was professional hypocrisy; that was an easy habit to learn, too. It leaked over into everything; you could feel it when you stood on the sidelines at the parties that should have been gay but weren‘t. The masks were on and daggers were in the sleeves.</p>
   <p>Well, it was a tough game, but it was the only game in town; maybe I‘d better study up on the rules. Kerrigan was the logical man to talk to. I got up and went into his office.</p>
   <p>Kerrigan made a ritual of pressing the tobacco into the bowl of his pipe with his thumb, and looked at me.</p>
   <p>“So you‘re beginning to feel the pinch … ”</p>
   <p>He got out a match and struck it and waited for the flare to die down and got the tobacco burning. He put the match in an ashtray and took the pipe out of his mouth. He inhaled smoke and sighed. A pipe was handy when you wanted to think before you spoke. Maybe I ought to try one.</p>
   <p>“Bayard, you‘ve put yourself in a difficult situation. When you take on the Admin Officer, the odds are stacked against you. Maybe you‘re a thousand percent right. But that‘s not what counts. It‘s the effect on the people who control your future.”</p>
   <p>Kerrigan drew on the pipe.</p>
   <p>“Now, one of the things you‘re being judged on is how you get along with people. You have to walk very softly, and take great care what you say. You‘re a newcomer; Sutton is your senior; he won‘t be called on to substantiate his position. And he doesn‘t have to make any serious charges; ever heard of damning with faint praise? Sutton could stall a promotion for years just by saying This officer does a pretty fair job ..</p>
   <p>“Now,” Kerrigan went on, “you‘re probably thinking that if I stepped in with a favorable report, contradicted Bert, it would all cancel out … “ Kerrigan frowned at his pipe. “But would I write such a report?”</p>
   <p>Kerrigan was doing pretty well answering his own questions, so I waited.</p>
   <p>“Your work is very competent; but frankly, Brion, I can‘t afford to mix in this matter. I‘m too selfish; or too cowardly. Call it what you will. I have a difficult enough task without thrusting into things I can stay out of.”</p>
   <p>I looked at Kerrigan and he looked at me.</p>
   <p>“It isn‘t simple, Brion. The system has been built up over the years by a lot of very determined people; within itself it‘s equitable. There are certain demands in terms of independence, self-indulgence—or self-respect, if you prefer; and there are corresponding rewards. Its up to a man to decide for himself whether those rewards are sufficient.</p>
   <p>I lit a cigar, dropped the lighter in my pocket. Cigars are useful, too.</p>
   <p>“It‘s no accident that Bert Sutton has the power to break you. If you can‘t make Sutton like you—or at least accept you—then theres no place for you in the Foreign Service.</p>
   <p>If you should survive Sutton without making any basic adjustment in your attitude, you‘d only be deferring the inevitable. You‘d go under sooner or later, as soon as your fixed ideas were challenged again.”</p>
   <p>Kerrigan puffed at his pipe. “Now, you might think of taking it up with the inspectors. If you do, they‘ll talk to Bert first; then they‘ll talk to Tom Hurd and any number of other people who may have a grievance against you for some reason or other—</p>
   <p>I must have blinked because Kerrigan looked at me and raised his eyebrows. “Don‘t look surprised. There are many people who would be ready to take up the tarbrush against you; in addition to the Admin staff, of course.”</p>
   <p>I looked at my cigar. “What is it, dandruff, or whiskey breath?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, I‘ve no doubt you get along with the staff; but not well enough that if Bert hinted he‘d be favorably impressed by someone who had something to say to the Inspectors about you— Kerrigan spread his hands. Or, he went on, you might mention it to the Ambassador. Hed listen. Then hed call in Brad Paine and Bert and theyd decide what to do about you, since you apparently arent able to fit yourself to life in the Foreign Service, with your persecution complex and your abnormal suspicions.</p>
   <p>I stood up. Kerrigan eyed me.</p>
   <p>“I hope . . . ah . . . that you won‘t quote me too directly.”</p>
   <p>I shook my head.</p>
   <p>“You‘re feeling pretty contemptuous of me, Brion, I know … ”</p>
   <p>I waited.</p>
   <p>“Bert has been up to see me, twice. Tom Hurd, once. I turned them down. I‘m giving you a good E.R. I can‘t do any more than that. I‘m sorry.”</p>
   <p>I went back to the outer office.</p>
   <p>“If anybody wants me, Ann,” I said, “I‘ll be in Sutton‘s office.”</p>
   <subtitle>6</subtitle>
   <p>Bert Sutton lifted the CLASSIFIED cover sheet and glanced at the memo from ICA. Something about riot guns for the police. Why did they bother the Admin Officer with this stuff? And why classify it SECRET? Wasn‘t it common knowledge that ICA was supplying guns? It seemed like Harry Yung How had said something about it the other night, asking when the stuff was coming, or something of the sort. He didn‘t remember; it wasn‘t important. It had been a great party, and he and Harry had gotten high as a kite. Nobody could say Bert Sutton was bigoted—look at the way he treated Harry like an equal. Harry was a real pal. He understood Berts problems better than a lot of people here in the Embassy. Good old Harry . . .</p>
   <p>Bert looked at the clock. He was looking forward to Bayard‘s showing up for a little session. This was another very nifty technique he had devised. As Admin Officer, with a natural interest in his Personnel Section, he had every right to call a difficult case in now and then and try to reason with him, and afterwards, without any necessity for faking anything, merely note down a remark here and there that showed the uncooperative, belligerent attitude of the man—and another nice Memo for the Record dropped into the file. The inspectors had a lot of faith in a set of memos with a nice time-spread; and they were going to get a lulu.</p>
   <p>Bert looked at his watch. Maybe Bayard wasn‘t going to show up. A smile twitched his lips. That would be OK, too. A simple memo saying the man had failed to appear was as useful as any other recorded insolence.</p>
   <subtitle>7</subtitle>
   <p>. . . Mabel told Bert I was there; I heard him giving her the routine about seeing me when he was free. I went past her into the room and she faded out and I closed the door and leaned on Bert‘s desk.</p>
   <p>“Here— he started.</p>
   <p>“Call it off, Bert,” I said. “Your campaign has kept you amused for a month now. And I‘ve had a belly full.”</p>
   <p>Bert smiled. “Campaign?” He studied his fingernails. “Aren‘t you talking rather wildly?”</p>
   <p>“You‘re a hard man to ignore, Bert; I‘ll give you that; but what do you say we both try it?”</p>
   <p>Bert‘s expression was cold now, like a loan shark on pay day. “You‘re saying that I‘ve set out to make you unhappy? Isn‘t that a little absurd?”</p>
   <p>“For a boy your age, yes.”</p>
   <p>“You‘re an insolent upstart, Bayard,” Bert said. “You‘d better go along now before you say something that will cause you serious trouble.”</p>
   <p>“Let‘s put it this way, Bert,” I said. “You stick to chasing the girls and running your complaint department down here, and you won‘t have time to keep your nose in my business. It‘s been fun, but it‘s over—unless you like unpleasant surprises.</p>
   <p>I walked out I had made my bluff. Maybe it would work. The next move was up to Bert.</p>
   <subtitle>8</subtitle>
   <p>Kerrigan placed the memo from Chalmers at ICA back on Paine‘s desk.</p>
   <p>“Well, Bradley, you know how I feel on this thing,” he said, “there are other items in the project list I might perhaps have put ahead of police equipment, but then I know I don‘t have the full picture as you do.”</p>
   <p>“You‘re looking at it from the purely economic view, Howard. But without political stability, aid to the economy is fruitless.”</p>
   <p>“I hope we can get quick agreement now on the next project. I don‘t mind saying my section is falling behind on scheduled reporting—</p>
   <p>“Do the best you can, Howard. We understand this is throwing a heavy workload your way. How is Bayard working out?”</p>
   <p>Kerrigan reached for his pipe, remembered Paine disliked smoke, cleared his throat.</p>
   <p>“A quick mind,” Kerrigan said. “Energetic … ”</p>
   <p>Paine tapped papers into alignment on his desk. “Any . . . ah . . . friction with the other personnel of the section?”</p>
   <p>“Well, one or two of the girls have commented on his being a little over-critical, rather too demanding. Of course, Jakes has been rather . . . indulgent . . . in the past.”</p>
   <p>“Hmmm … ”</p>
   <p>“Nothing serious, of course. A good man, Bradley. Some of my locals are a little upset. They‘re disturbed by the changes Bayard is making. They‘re very conservative, you know. But I must say progress is being made.”</p>
   <p>“We can‘t have our clerical and local staffs upset, Howard. Perhaps you‘d better have a talk with the man.”</p>
   <p>“Just what I was thinking, Bradley. Talking to you about it has clarified it in my mind.”</p>
   <p>“Of course. And I‘ll add my voice to your own on a prompt handling of the next project agreement.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>After Kerrigan had left Paine sat looking out at the sky. There were too many things coming to fruition simultaneously, he reflected. The new Mining Law to digest for Washington—odd that the Department always preferred to work from an interpretation of a document, rather than the original—but not so odd after all, really. The Department liked to have a scapegoat, too, in case of a blunder. And the police equipment agreement; he had serious doubts as to the wisdom of the move, in spite of the confidential talk about control of lawless civil elements, and the public line of pacification of the insurgents. Kerrigan might well be right. It wasnt a proper role for the U.S., supplying arms to these unstable Samoyans. No telling what they would do. Happily, that was not his responsibility; the Ambassador and Fred Chalmers had handled the negotiation.</p>
   <p>Then the Congressional delegation arriving this afternoon. Everything would stop now for three days, while the Embassy outdid itself in a giddy social marathon in the hope of placating the legislators. This was going to be an awkward confrontation: Alpin, a staunch foe of foreign aid; Whipple, of the Finance Committee, and Hodges, as windy a politico as ever bought a vote. It would be a task worthy of Solomon to please all of them.</p>
   <p>And to cap it all, Marie . . .</p>
   <p>It had been difficult, last night. Far more difficult than he had anticipated. He had never been more drawn to her then when she stood so determinedly holding back her tears—while he told her that it would be better if in the future they limited their association to cocktail party chats . . . .</p>
   <p>Whatever she had come to say, she had not said. She had smiled brightly, and asked if he still wanted her to help with the dinner for the Congressmen. Of course he did, certainly. Please, my dear, don‘t interpret what I‘ve said as being in any way critical . . .</p>
   <p>Bah! She understood as well as he. He was too timid to respond to her as he might have wished, too conventional. She had come to him for help, and he had erected the barrier. Now the thought of her came between his problems and their solution. The plans for the next three days which the Escort Officer had sent up were still unchecked, his own briefing papers not completed, and he was thinking only of Marie. Confound it, he mustn‘t let her think that it was indifference on his part; far from it. But he could not afford the risk of involvement.</p>
   <p>And after all, he was foolish to think that a young girl like Marie could have any real interest in a man his age. That was the thought to dwell on, even if he didn‘t believe it . . .</p>
   <p>And now there were matters requiring attention. But he would find a moment tonight . . .</p>
   <subtitle>9</subtitle>
   <p>Horace Zwicker, Chief of the Political Section, handed the memo from ICA across the desk to Clinton Lewis, FSR-4. Lewis frowned at the paper, saying nothing, handed it back. He was playing his usual role of man of mystery, Zwicker noted. Like most of your hush-hush Confidential Source people, he was a bit childish; but probably a tendency to self-dramatization was a valuable—if not essential—trait in their line. The automatic habit of deceit, another unfortunate characteristic of your well-adapted CS man, made dealing with Lewis a rather nasty experience, unless one concentrated on the amusing aspects.</p>
   <p>“Now that Winjee‘s to get his guns,” Lewis said casually, “which way do you suppose he‘ll turn them?”</p>
   <p>“When this first came up, Clint, I expressed the opinion that in arming one of your factions—even your<emphasis> de jure </emphasis>government—we would be guilty of interference in Samoyan internal affairs. That position was overruled. The feeling of the Embassy is that this will give your forces of law and order the necessary sinew to pacify the remnants of the insurgency.</p>
   <p>There, let Lewis mull that over. He was easily satisfied by a rambling circular statement. After all, the man had been a common file clerk only four years before; he was untrained, inexperienced. Only the incredible promotion policies of his Agency had raised him to the rank of FSR-4 so precipitately. It was a mistake, assigning to outsiders rank which placed them on a level with FSO‘s of far greater experience without having met even a fraction of the rigid qualifications your FSO must meet. It resulted in fantastic inequities. And the grotesque airs assumed by the wives of these interlopers—It made it very difficult for the well-bred young women of the post.</p>
   <p>Lewis was fingering his wispy mustache. What an unwholesome figure the man was, slack jointed, round-shouldered, unkempt! How transparent his efforts to pose leading questions inobtrusively.</p>
   <p>“I suppose well be hearing something from the SPP when the news breaks,” Lewis said, gazing at the filing cabinet.</p>
   <p>“Your SPP has never been known to be reticent when an opportunity to denounce your capitalist war-monger presented itself,” Zwicker said. This foolish fencing was a waste of valuable time; and with a Congressional briefing coming up this afternoon—</p>
   <p>“You expecting SPP activity?”</p>
   <p>“The SPP is always active.” Lewis could dig out his own information. His Agency paid him well enough; let it collect value received through its own channels. Why should the Political Section share hard-won information and credit? The Embassy knew quite well what was in the wind, of course. The police equipment was no haphazard move; the Communists were planning a major uprising within a matter of weeks or months; the arms were urgently needed if the government were to suppress it. That was why the matter had been so highly classified; if a hint had leaked to the Reds, the thing would have erupted prematurely. They would have made their move at once, before the defenses were ready. That danger would exist right up until the delivery of the equipment. Meanwhile, let Lewis and his group chase whatever red herrings they chose; the Political Section was on top of the situation; the Embassy was fully informed.</p>
   <subtitle>10</subtitle>
   <p>In his temporary office in the shack behind the East Asiatic Company godown on Daijee Street, Marshall-to-be Yin-Yin of the soon-to-be-triumphant People‘s Party of Samoy unfolded the soiled paper and read it over carefully. The messenger who had brought it sidled closer, peering.</p>
   <p>“What does the devil-writing tell, Yin-Yin?” he asked eagerly. “I—</p>
   <p>Yin-Yin looked up. “Why are you idling here, fool, questioning your betters? Get out!”</p>
   <p>“But Yin-Yin, it was I who brought the writing … ”</p>
   <p>“It behooves a cleaner of white men‘s toilets to address me as Lord Yin-Yin, scum! Now get to your post! But first, tell Oon to come here.”</p>
   <p>Yin-Yin crouched over the battered table, jiggling his foot nervously. “The items supplied,” he read, “will include armored cars, half-tracks, mortars, rockets, grenades, and small-arms. ...”</p>
   <p>Oon came into the room. “What do you want, Yin-Yin?”</p>
   <p>Yin-Yin passed over the crumpled memo.</p>
   <p>“Now we can proceed into the final phase,” he said. “I want a messenger sent North at once; alert those in Tokyo that nothing must interfere with the prompt shipment of these guns.”</p>
   <p>“Give me a writing; it will be in the diplomatic pouch of the Yankee courier tomorrow.”</p>
   <p>“No; none of your tricks this time. It is too great a matter. You know who to speak to at the airport about special cargo on the SNA midnight flight.”</p>
   <p>“What about the demonstrators?”</p>
   <p>“They will continue as at present, but there must be no attention directed to our activities at the army depot. I want stepped-up agitation at the University this week, with the theme ‘Friendship with People‘s China‘. Also, it is time for a lull along the waterfront. I want no difficulties when the shipment arrives, nor do I wish to draw attention by a sudden increase in efficiency.”</p>
   <p>“Already I have kept my demonstrators alerted for too long, Yin-Yin. They have worked well among the mob; they are ready now—</p>
   <p>“Your grievances are of no interest. The People‘s Republic of Samoy will not be grateful for failures. Keep the rabble ready—but tightly leashed. I want no premature outburst!</p>
   <p>“That is not an easy thing; but I will hold them, somehow. How much longer must we wait?”</p>
   <p>“Shipment of the guns commences at once; allow a week for bureaucratic fumbling, another for actual transit; on the day the arms lie in the depot, we launch the riots; not an hour sooner. If the workers at the depot have been chosen well the seizure of the arms should be quickly accomplished.”</p>
   <p>“It is long to wait.”</p>
   <p>“Not too long for great rewards. With the guns in our hands, the establishment of the People‘s regime will be complete in a matter of hours. There will be much wealth to appropriate and redistribute, many fine houses, much whiskey and women for all.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, that will be a fine thing, Yin-Yin. You will not forget my loyal service … ”</p>
   <p>“I will not forget.”</p>
   <p>Frowning, Yin-Yin stared after Oon as he left the room. He was a weak staff to lean upon. It was a bitter thing, but among his fellow Samoyans there were few worthy of a part in the Plan. They were lazy, foolish people. It was fortunate indeed that Those in the North had sent him a few Chinese agitators. They could be relied upon to follow orders; but a fool like Oon: left to his own, he would let the mobs run wild, to loot and rape for a few days, settle a few old scores, then sink back into apathy. But he must hold them now a few weeks longer; it was the destiny of Marshal Yin-yin to take the guns of the imperialists, slay their lackeys, and rule supreme at Samoy.</p>

   <p>Major George M. B. Howard, B. S. C., Ret., General Secretary of the SPFD, looked at the paper lying on his battered desk in a fenced-in corner of the general office of the East Asiatic Company.</p>
   <p>“I‘m not at all sure, Teddie, that I should read this. You know I disapprove of filching things in that way. Position of trust and that sort of thing, you know.”</p>
   <p>“It‘s OK, George. I just copied off the carbon paper. I didn‘t actually make off with anything. Just the information.”</p>
   <p>“Well . . . after all, it‘s in their own interest I should be informed. I suppose it‘s all right.”</p>
   <p>Howard picked up the copy of Chalmers‘ memo and read through it.</p>
   <p>“My word,” he said. He read the memo through again.</p>
   <p>“I say, Teddie. This is not so good, I think. Suppose those Reds get a finger in this pie, eh?”</p>
   <p>Teddie smiled. “Well, you know I‘m not so up-to-date on all the technical matters, George. Whatever you say.”</p>
   <p>“Look here, Teddie, you‘ve got to take notice what‘s in the wind. It‘s the same for all us Eurasians. Once these bloody Samoyans are in full charge here, it‘s all up with us. And in any case, we can‘t have ruddy coolies ordering gentlemen about.”</p>
   <p>“Nothing to worry over, George. They can‘t do without us Anglos.”</p>
   <p>Howard tapped his slender brown fingers on the desk top. ‘Teddie, I think we‘d better call a meeting of the Fencibles tonight. At my place. Round all the chaps up and tell them it‘s serious. Nine o‘clock sharp.”</p>
   <p>“Right-o, George; if you think so … ”</p>
   <p>“Better get cracking, Teddie. Don‘t miss anyone. My place at nine.”</p>

   <p>Standing with the Ambassador near the French windows commanding the drive by which the Congressional party would arrive, Bradley Paine glanced across at Marie, arranging the flowers in the center of the long table. How graceful she was; how her presence brightened the drab room. He had noticed that she looked rather pale when she came, greeting him briefly and hurrying past. Poor child; he had wanted to reach to her then, tell her—</p>
   <p>“ . . . I hope you can hold any discussion of that aspect of the agreement in safe channels, Bradley,” the Ambassador‘s voice penetrated.</p>
   <p>“Quite so, Mr. Ambassador.” This came of mooning over Marie; he was groping, unsure of the thread of the Ambassador‘s instructions. The Ambassador was waiting. He would have to say something, a vague generality . . .</p>
   <p>“Our principal problem will be Alpin, I‘m sure. According to the biographical file on him, he will be well prepared with the most embarrassing questions—</p>
   <p>‘Well, yes, Bradley. That‘s very much the ground I‘ve just covered.” The Ambassador was looking at him with some asperity.</p>
   <p>“I mean merely to emphasize that Whipple and Hodges pose no particular threat—</p>
   <p>“Yes, yes, I think we understand where our problem lies. It‘s a trifle late now to prepare our strategy, Bradley; I hope you have absorbed my approach to this: above-board, no elaborate diversions; in a word—sincerity. Well impress this group better with austerity and apparent candor. My instructions from the Department were quite explicit on that point.</p>
   <p>The Ambassador turned away. His irritation was understandable; a Congressional visit, even an unofficial call by junketers, was always an awkward time. It was essential to woo the men who controlled the funds; and there were conditions at the post that required careful presentation to prevent misinterpretation; practices which might appear at a glance to be almost—well, improper—unless one were close to the situation. Yes, it was a delicate undertaking to present matters in a favorable light, without appearing to conceal. But if the liquor were kept flowing freely enough, and the social events were lively and plentiful . . .</p>
   <p>Flags fluttering briskly from the fender staffs, the limousine swung around the curve of the drive and drew up before the entry steps. The Ambassador was already hurrying toward the door; where was Marie? The performance was about to begin . . .</p>
   <subtitle>2</subtitle>
   <p>. . . I was watching Lewis outmaneuver Zwicker to ease in between the fat Congressman and the little dried-up one when Paine‘s bearer came over and offered me a plate with an envelope with my name written across it. I opened it and took out a folded sheet torn from a small notebook. Words were scrawled on it:</p>
   <p>‘Bayard; bring my sister to the side entry. Don‘t tell anyone.</p>
   <p>Lars‘</p>
   <p>I showed it to Ingred. She read it and I could feel her tensing up.</p>
   <p>“Where is the side entry, Brion?”</p>
   <p>“Over there.”</p>
   <p>We went across the room and down a short hall and stepped out onto a narrow paved terrace. A security light on the wall above us put a yellow glare on the walk and the hedge. Lars Lund stepped out from the shadow of an acacia tree twenty feet away. Ingred went to him.</p>
   <p>“Lasse! Vad ar fel?”</p>
   <p>“Det var ingeting, alskling.”</p>
   <p>I came up to them. Lars looked at me. He smiled and looked a little embarrassed.</p>
   <p>“I‘ve got to disappear, Bayard,” he said.</p>
   <p>Ingred gripped his hand. “It‘s that horrible Indian ..</p>
   <p>Lars looked at me.</p>
   <p>“I‘ve been a very foolish fellow. The police have told me to stay at my house, but I have to get clear of Samoy. I knew this was coming. I talked to a lawyer, Suvi. A good chap.”</p>
   <p>“Lasse … ”</p>
   <p>“He told me to get out quickly. I waited a little too long.</p>
   <p>A European would not be happy in the Samoy jail.”</p>
   <p>Ingred drew in a sharp breath.</p>
   <p>“You can‘t—</p>
   <p>“No time now. I‘ll write. There are some things I must say to Brion and then I shall be on my way. They are watching the airport, and there are no reliable ships in the harbor. My best bet is on foot to the Thai border. It is only 120 kilometers; I am a good walker.”</p>
   <p>“That‘s rough country.”</p>
   <p>“For me, not so rough as this.” Lars grinned again. He never was what you‘d call a serious type.</p>
   <p>“But, if you have a pistol … “he added.</p>
   <p>“All I have is a .25 automatic.”</p>
   <p>“It would be good to have. And Brion, I need U.S. dollars, a couple of hundred anyway, in case I have to buy my way clear of border guards or dacoits, and a little for a ticket, maybe. Once in Bangkok, I‘m OK. I‘ll check in with my line there; they‘ll get me home.”</p>
   <p>I looked at my watch. “Can you wait here for—say forty-five minutes?</p>
   <p>“Whatever you say, Brion.”</p>
   <p>“I can get some emergency rations from Macy Nagler, maybe. Anything else you can think of?”</p>
   <p>“Insect repellent and water disinfectant, if you can. I had plans, but there wasn‘t time.”</p>
   <p>“All right,” I said. “Come on, Ingred. Let‘s get going.”</p>
   <p>“Brion,” she said as we walked to the car. “Will he be all right?”</p>
   <p>“Sure,” I said. But I was thinking it‘s a lonely stroll from here to Bangkok.</p>
   <subtitle>3</subtitle>
   <p>Congressman Whipple sampled the steaming rice dish.</p>
   <p>“Ambassador, isn‘t this Indian—what do you call it—curry? Now I was hoping wed have some real Samoyan food out here.</p>
   <p>“We‘ve found, Mr. Whipple,” Bradley Paine said, “that the only truly Samoyan dish, a kind of fish preparation, is, well—inedible, to the western palate—</p>
   <p>“I‘d like to try it,” Whipple said flatly.</p>
   <p>“We employ Indian or Chinese cooks for the most part; we‘ve become rather fond of many of their dishes. The delicate flavor—</p>
   <p>“Where‘s the ketchup?”</p>
   <p>Hodges held his water glass up to the light. He turned to the Ambassador.</p>
   <p>“Is this water safe to drink?”</p>
   <p>“Why, I‘m quite certain the water has been boiled—</p>
   <p>“I got into some bad water back there in Karachi. My stomach—</p>
   <p>“You‘re not in the railroad station now, Herb,” Whipple said. “I warned you about that public water tap.”</p>
   <p>“I don‘t trust any water any more.”</p>
   <p>“Well, Herb, you know how to disinfect it; just add alcohol.”</p>
   <p>“Paine, do you have any French wine? I‘m a great admirer of French wine.”</p>
   <p>“Let‘s see if the Champagne is chilled yet,” Paine said.</p>
   <p>“Mr. Paine.” Alpin glanced at the bearer standing near his chair. “Why‘s this fellow hanging around so close? Seems rather interested in the conversation.”</p>
   <p>“That‘s the number two cook; he‘s helping out as bearer. He speaks no English; he‘s merely over-attentive.”</p>
   <p>“He looks like a Chinaman.”</p>
   <p>“Yes; they make excellent servants; better than the Sa-moyans.”</p>
   <p>Hodges turned to Marie Cummins.</p>
   <p>“Well, honey, how do you like it out here in Asia?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, it‘s very—very interesting.</p>
   <p>“Not much for you ladies to do, is there?”</p>
   <p>Marie stared at him. “What do you mean … ”</p>
   <p>“Well, there‘s not much in the way of beauty parlors and moving picture shows out here, no television; why, if my wife couldn‘t watch her television every evening, I just don‘t know what she‘d do.”</p>
   <p>“This silverware,” Whipple said. “It looks pretty fancy. Wouldn‘t something plainer do?”</p>
   <p>“Why, I suppose it would, Mr. Whipple,” Paine said. “I suppose it‘s a matter of taste—</p>
   <p>“Expensive tastes!”</p>
   <p>“Herb,” Alpin said, “I think—</p>
   <p>“And these dishes. Looks to me like you could eat just as well off something cheaper.” He lifted a sugar bowl and looked at the bottom. “Jap made, too. We make some pretty good china right back in the States … ”</p>
   <p>“Herb, these are Mr. Paine‘s private possessions you‘re talking about. Only the Ambassador is provided with government owned tableware.”</p>
   <p>“Oh. Still think a little economy would be in order.” Whipple frowned at his plate, resumed eating.</p>
   <subtitle>4</subtitle>
   <p>Colonel Harvey Throst stole a glance at his wristwatch. This damned dinner looked as if it would last all night; and he‘d have to stick around for an hour or so after the meal was over waiting for the Ambassador to leave, before he could get the hell away from here. This was a lousy way to spend an evening, with Ruth waiting . . .</p>
   <p>The time he had spent briefing himself to the eyebrows was wasted, too. These fellows weren‘t interested in military matters. Whipple was a half-smart budget-trimmer; Hodges was a small-timer washed up on the beach by the political tide. And Alpin, who seemed like a capable guy, out after ammunition for his Cut-Foreign-Aid campaign—every time he began to get on the trail of something, one of the diplomatic boys would lead him off. You had to give them credit. It was smooth as silk. Too bad he couldnt tip him off, but that was Alpins look-out; he was the penny-pincher, let him dig. That was what he was here for.</p>
   <subtitle>5</subtitle>
   <p>Along the table, Bert Sutton was staring at Marie. She looked up, caught Bert‘s eye. She blushed and looked away.</p>
   <p>Another hour, Bert Sutton thought. One hour, and that little ripe peach would drop into his hand. Peaches have thin skin, but when they‘re peeled . . .</p>
   <p>It was a break Ruth had a meeting. Why these women waited until late at night to get together and gab when they had all day with nothing to do was a puzzler; but it worked out swell for Bert. He could take Marie home, waste no time, and get her back to her place before anybody had time to get nosy. He had put a lot of time into this project, but it was worth it. Nothing was easy to get in this world; that was the thing you had to realize; you had to fight for everything. Job, promotion, prestige—and when you finally made it, when you were somebody, had the power—even then you had to go on fighting; you had to know how to use what you had gained. It wasnt enough for Marie that he was Bert Sutton, FSO-3, the number six man in the Embassy. No, he had to set up a situation where he could show her just what power he had, how dependent on him she was. Their little talk last night had been very effective. And she had been smart enough not to run to Paine. These young wives were all the same; after a taste of high living, big houses, servants, plenty of money coming in every month, theyd do anything to keep it. They remembered back when their husbands were sweating it out at some hack job, and there was never enough in the kitty for a new dress or a trip. They couldnt go back to that. And Marie was no exception. Just a little scared that she might lose all this, that was enough. She would come through, all right. He could spend the next hour planning just how hed stage the scene. No quick scuffle in the dark for Bert Sutton . . .</p>
   <subtitle>6</subtitle>
   <p>Marie Cummins sat stiffly, trying to smile and talk to the Congressman beside her. It was hopeless. All she could think of was Bert Sutton, sitting down the table from her, leering at her every time he could catch her eye. Last night—it had been horrible, what he had said to her. Could men really talk to a married woman like that and just . . . just . . . have nothing happen? Right there in her own living room, telling her she was . . . sleeping with . . . Mr. Paine, and that he was going to tell, and that Henry would be ruined, and Mr.</p>
   <p>Paine, too—But that maybe, if she would act a little friendlier . . .</p>
   <p>And now he was waiting, sitting there, and after a while the dinner would be over and he would take her out to his car and . . .</p>
   <p>What a fool she had been, thinking Bradley would come to her defense. Maybe it was lucky he had told her to keep her distance before Bert had said what he had. If it had been a few days before, she would have told Bert to get out, and gone straight to Bradley—and with his feeling the way he did, that would have been a disaster. But now . . . there was no one. Not Henry. Not Bradley. She would have to look out for herself, now.</p>
   <p>And Bert was waiting . . .</p>

   <p>Congressman Hodges half-stifled a yawn. A boring evening; at most of the posts warm hospitality was extended to Members of Congress who had showed enough interest to undertake this difficult trip out to these remote areas; but not here. A dull dinner with a crew of Embassy officials, poor food, and no-year Champagne. It showed a darn near contemptuous attitude, as if a Member of Congress was just another tourist. Maybe they were forgetting who controlled the purse-strings.</p>
   <p>Back at that last stop, for example, there was that marvellous native feast, fine entertainment, with some young dancers—those girls had real talent—and the shops and bazaars, the boar hunt, swimming and boating, and the dinner-dance aboard the yacht, out on the lake . . .</p>
   <p>That had been a real visit; the Embassy had gone all out to show them a royal welcome. They had seen the country as it really was. They hadn‘t sat around stuffy dinner-tables; they had mingled with the local people, gotten the feel of things. That was the kind of thing a conscientious legislator hoped to get from an exhausting journey of this sort; information to take back to the people at home, something to show that their representative was active, alert, well-informed. When the post helped a man to see things that way, it showed that post was doing a job. You remembered their enthusiasm and efficiency when the Bureau of the Budget sent over their list of projects for approval. A bunch like that would do even better work, with a new building or two . . .</p>

   <p>Bradley Paine watched as Sutton‘s car moved off down the drive. Marie had walked out at Bert‘s side, hardly speaking to him when he came forward to thank her for her assistance—and to tell her that he had been wrong, that her companionship was too important to him to relinquish . . . . But he had seen his mistake in time.</p>
   <p>No, the girl was no pining wallflower, to languish over Bradley Paine‘s withdrawal of his society. Having failed to ensnare the Deputy Chief of Mission, she had gone to her husband‘s immediate superior; lesser game, of course, but adequate. And Sutton, the possessive grip of his hand under her elbow, the familiar, almost contemptuous manner in which he spoke to her as they stood together at the door. Where Paine had hesitated, Sutton had not. And while he had vacillated, the prize had fallen to the jackal.</p>
   <p>“Well, Bradley … “ The Ambassador had come up to his side. “I think it went off rather well.”</p>
   <p>“Perhaps so, Mr. Ambassador,” Paine said. “Nothing of any moment came under discussion; talk was held—though rather awkwardly on one or two occasions—to innocuous channels. The legislators stirred up no anthills of controversy. Another petty victory of trained shrewdness over the inept curiosity of the outsider . . . .</p>
   <p>“What‘s that, Bradley?”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Paine said. “The proper mixture of indirection, prevarication and alcohol produced the usual salutary results. We can relax until the next time, secure in the knowledge that our shabby little operation here will continue undisturbed for the present … ”</p>
   <p>“Paine?” The Ambassador sounded incredulous. No doubt, Paine thought, it was rather fantastic. Bradley Paine, one of the best-trained seals in the entire zoo, suddenly bites his keeper. But sometimes perhaps even a seal feels the chafe of his confinement, the tedium of sham . . .</p>
   <p>“You‘re not well, Bradley. I suggest you get a day‘s rest tomorrow. Your cynicism does you no credit.”</p>
   <p>The Ambassador walked away. Paine glanced after him indifferently. The pompous little martinet was furious. Very well, let him be. What difference did it make? Let him write an extra paragraph in Paine‘s Efficiency Report; that was the limit of his threat; a sputtering of words on paper. That was what the well-trained diplomatist understood—words on paper. These were his lance and shield; action was foreign to his nature. Within the comforting bulwarks of paper, the paper reassurance of regulations and reports, he built his little world of words, clever, hollow, expedient. Youthful ideals, mature ambitions, stirring of conscience and flights of fancy alike were vanquished by the irresistible weight of words, buried beneath the silent white leaves of paper.</p>
   <p>Very well! So much for philosophy; it had been a brief, joyous, asinine diversion from the plotted course, and like all such diversions, best forgotten quickly. Tomorrow held its fresh quota of paper challenge, to meet which, words would, as usual, suffice. There would be the Ambassador to placate, three bored legislators to delude, junior staff members to intimidate, local officials to appease—and, oh, yes. One haunting memory of a foolish fancy to ignore . . .</p>

   <p>Henry went into the kitchen and poured himself a fresh-lime from the pitcher in the refrigerator. It was dark and quiet in the house. It would be nice if you could turn on a radio and get music, voices. But it took a big ten tube job to bring in even Bangkok from here.</p>
   <p>It was after eleven now. Marie said she‘d be late. No telling how late that meant. They might get to talking a lot of policy matters and sit around most of the night. It would be good to get out of the house. Maybe he could go down to the office and work for an hour or two. It would be peaceful, with nobody coming in wanting things, and he could work down that pile of book translation contracts for USIS. It would be interesting to know what these books really said, printed in Samoyan. It was worse than Chinese. It would be a real hell of a note if the Reds were sneaking in anti-U.S. copy, and having the Embassy print it and distribute it. But that wasn‘t his worry; he just had to follow orders.</p>
   <p>Outside, the stars were bright, hanging low over the lake. Across on the other side, the lights of the residence twinkled dutifully. Quite an honor for Marie to be acting as hostess for Mr. Paine.</p>
   <p>Henry started the Ford, headed out along the Ludo Road toward the Embassy.</p>
   <subtitle>10</subtitle>
   <p>The cycle-shaw in which Alice Chan sat moved at a snail‘s pace through the noise of the teeming street. How they swarmed, here in the night in Chinatown, aimlessly wandering, milling in the glare of light from the illuminated signs, haggling under the canvas covers of tiny stalls, or squatting in groups, puffing at long pipes, the old grey-beards with wrinkled brown faces and work gnarled hands, young men with bandy legs and bowed backs, women with drawn features and bodies broken by child-bearing. How patiently her people endured their serfdom; how clever with their hands at the carving of ivory and the shaping of silver, with fitting of fine woods and the delicate embroidery of silk; so tireless and submissive, toiling through their lives for a cupful of rice each day, watching their children die from the filth and hunger, their own lives cut short by the killing labor; and yet, at night, they thronged the streets, chattered and laughed, bartered and traded, hawked their wares, sipped tea, played mah jong on tiny tables in impossible corners, made love in the shadows, gobbled rice, lit firecrackers, raised up the sounds of living against the voracious surrounding night.</p>
   <p>They were brave, her people, brave, and so foolish, so pitiful. There was more to life than eternal labor and ever-present hunger, dirt and heat and crowding. Alice Chan knew this much. Did she not herself go every day to the Embassy of the Americans, to sit in a chair finer than her grandmother‘s great chair, in a room spacious and clean, magically cooled, brightly lit, with fine rugs and costly appointments? Yes, she saw these things each day, saw the great boxes filled with rich foods, fit for the Empress, that the Americans carried out past her desk, every day. For each family, each week, there was food enough to feed all her clan for a month—and such food! It was not strange that the men of the Americans were so tall and strong, with flashing eyes, shoulders like warriors, faces as smooth and pink as a womans. Yes, they were truly god-like men, the Americans, even the old and soft ones. And how strange that with such an abundance of rice, and meat, and oil, they still could not grow fat, as a man of much rice should be, that all may know his status.</p>
   <p>They were strange, the American foreigners. One knew from the films, and from the Book of the Silver Screen, that far away in their own land they lived in palaces set in a wonderland of smooth greenery and parks tended as the Imperial hunting preserve at Peking had once been. Why then did they come to live here in Samoy, in this dismal land of exile? Her own father had been driven here by the soldiers of Mao Tse-tung, after the Generalissimo had fled to the East. But surely Mao had not sent soldiers across the seas to America.</p>
   <p>But it was not for her to understand, it was enough that she had learned to speak English in the convent school, and had taught herself to sew dresses like those in the Book of the Silver Screen, and to paint her face, and to walk with her head held high and to speak to the men of the Embassy as an equal; for they were strange masters; they did not wish their servants to behave like servants, but to act as bold as a head wife or even as a favorite concubine, the boldest of women.</p>
   <p>And yet, they were not so different, the American men. They pretended to live in unnatural ways, to take only a single wife, and she more like an impatient creditor than a proper dependent of her master, but in fact the chief men among them took many women, as was proper for rich lords. How often the coolie-caste drivers of the Embassy laughed and joked among themselves as to the comings and goings in the night between the houses of the Americans.</p>
   <p>Yes, they were god-like men, but still human. And if they were more beautiful than the spindly, stunted men of her own people, their women, as if in compensation, were ugly as hill-devils. Their colorless, twisted hair, thin and lifeless; their great lumpy, misshapen bodies; their angry, red faces, and big mouths, and huge feet, and heavy, clumsy walk! How could the lovely men endure the sham of their ugly wives?</p>
   <p>Why did they not take pretty Chinese wives, like herself? Yes, she had a mirror; she knew that she had beauty. And that beauty was not for the grinning boy to whose parents her father had tried to barter her! If only the spell would fall from the eyes of the Americans, so that they could see that Alice Chan was a fitting mate for one of their number. And she would be a perfect number two wife, if there were one of the ugly women there ahead of her. What joy it would be to serve such a master as the broad-shouldered one with the gentle eyes, Henry. It would not be shameful to be number two wife to the little Mrs. Cummins. She was almost Chinese in her daintiness, her feminine decorum. Her face was pretty, too, if one could forget the staring eyes, and her figure was delicate, except for the ugly heavy breasts. It was not strange that Mr. Bradley Paine, who was very great among the Americans, should take her as his woman. But what a sadness this had brought to Henry. One could tell much, sitting every day, watching the Americans as they came and went, especially if one also overheard the drivers‘ gossip.</p>
   <p>No, her clan would not arrange a marriage for her with some petty merchant or shopkeeper in Chinatown. Her father was afraid of her; he had not stood up to her anger when he had last tried to use her as barter goods. He was afraid, too, of the men who came to his house to talk, but that she could understand. She feared them, too. They were strange men with harsh accents, and they stayed very late, and many of the men of the clans came to her father‘s house to see them. Always when they came, she went out to walk or, as tonight, to ride in a cycle-shaw through the streets, until they should go away. She did not like the way in which they looked at her.</p>
   <p>But the noise here was unpleasant, the sights and smells of Chinatown unbearable tonight. She would go out into the city, away from this; down Sho-ku Street—which was really Mackenzie Street, only the Samoyans had changed the sign—where the Embassy was. It was comforting to think that there was some little corner of the world of the Americans in which she belonged. She leaned forward and spoke to the cycle coolie. Ten minutes later, the tri-shaw pulled in before the Embassy just as the car of Mr. Henry Cummins arrived.</p>

   <p>Marie sat silently beside Bert as he gunned the Corvette out onto Tamwe Road. The way he looked at her made her spine crawl, but that didn‘t matter. She had decided what to do, and she‘d better get started . . .</p>
   <p>“Bert,” Marie said softly. “Last night when you talked to me, I think maybe I acted silly. Maybe you got the feeling I was sort of horrified … ”</p>
   <p>“Horrified?”</p>
   <p>“Well, not really horrified, but I mean I guess I acted like I didn‘t like . . . like I didn‘t like you . . . the way you like me.”</p>
   <p>“I did get the feeling you were a bit cool toward me, Marie. After all, crying … ”</p>
   <p>“It was such a surprise. You‘re so popular and important and everythnig … ”</p>
   <p>Bert gazed at Marie, looked back at the road in time to swerve around a parked jeep. “Marie? Me important? Why, what a crazy idea. I mean, good night, a girl as pretty as you are … ”</p>
   <p>“Any girl would naturally be awfully flattered ..</p>
   <p>“Ah, but you‘re pretty special yourself, my dear,” Bert said.</p>
   <p>“Can‘t we go some nice place and have a creme de cacao or something and just talk for a while? I want to know so many things about you, now that we‘re . . . now that … ”</p>
   <p>“Talk?” Bert shot a look at her. “Look here, Marie, maybe I didn‘t make myself plain enough last night … ”</p>
   <p>“Oh, you did, Bert. You‘re so direct and . . . manly. But I forgot to tell you. I mean I just remembered. We can‘t Not tonight.”</p>
   <p>“What do you mean, can‘t?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, Bert. You know, I just can‘t; not tonight. In a few days. But I wouldn‘t miss our getting to know each other better for anything … ”</p>
   <p>“Why the hell—what a time to …</p>
   <p>“Don‘t be angry.”</p>
   <p>“Marie, if I thought—</p>
   <p>“Shall we go have that little alexander or something?”</p>
   <p>“We might as well,” Bert snapped. He braked sharply, turned off onto University Road. “Let‘s go over to Kuan Li. That‘s a lively place.”</p>
   <p>“Whatever you say . . . Bert.” She moved closer to him and he put a friendly hand on her knee.</p>
   <p>“You sure had me fooled, Marie. You know, I actually thought you kind of—well—disliked me.</p>
   <p>“How could you think that, Bert?”</p>
   <p>“Look Marie, you‘ll have to forgive me for being so kind of blunt last night. I mean, after all, crazy as I am about you, well, when two people are both crazy about each other, that makes it a lot nicer. Even if we do just talk.”</p>
   <subtitle>12</subtitle>
   <p>. . . we let Lars off and drove back into the city and around the lake to the old Dragon Palace. The paper lanterns and painted dragons on the terrace had a cheerful look and I thought it might help to get Ingred‘s mind off her kid brother, but she shook her head.</p>
   <p>“Let‘s not sit out here,” she said. “I want to be away from the people. Can‘t we go inside—to one of the little private rooms?</p>
   <p>“Are you sure you want to go back there?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, please, Brion.”</p>
   <p>We walked around to the far side and up the steps. Spicy food smells, mingled with ancient odors of decay, hung like a curtain at the door. Round Chinese faces turned toward us, jaws working; a man came from the back, waving an arm to his barefooted busboy who darted to an alcove screened by threadbare brocade. The man bowed, smiling, indicated the private table. We sat down, and looked at soiled menus badly printed on cheap salmon-colored paper while the man talked rapidly in Chinese.</p>
   <p>“You see?” Ingred said. “The red carpet.”</p>
   <p>“The manager seems delighted to see us,” I said. “I hope that‘s a good sign. Just don‘t eat anything unless it‘s scalding hot.”</p>
   <p>The manager clapped his hands. A grinning Chinese boy thrust his head through the curtains. Ingred managed a smile. “I am glad we came,” she said.</p>
   <subtitle>13</subtitle>
   <p>Henry Cummins ducked back inside the curtained booth.</p>
   <p>“What is the matter?” Alice said.</p>
   <p>Henry looked at her. “Nothing. I . . . just thought of something. But it isn‘t important. Are you ready to go?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, ready.”</p>
   <p>Henry glanced out cautiously. Bayard and the girl were no longer in sight.</p>
   <p>“It‘s pretty late, Miss Chan. I guess we‘d better be on the way.” He held the curtain aside and Alice walked past him. It had been a dumb thing to do, impulsively inviting a local employee to a public place; but who would expect to see anybody here?</p>
   <p>Alice turned, took his hand. “Come,” she said. She was pretty, even if she was Chinese. Her skin was as white as his—whiter, even. And her jet-black hair was as glossy as silk. That little sleeveless dress was nice, and the way that slit up the side of the skirt showed her thigh was something.</p>
   <p>“Where to? I have to be getting home, Miss Chan.”</p>
   <p>“Not yet. It is early.”</p>
   <p>It was funny running into Alice in front of the Embassy. What was she doing down there at night? It was nice to have somebody pay some attention to him. Alice was neat and classy looking; she didn‘t fit in with this dingy restaurant, and these furtive-looking little Chinamen. She was exotic, that was the word. And she sure had nice legs.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>“You leave auto here.” Alice lead Henry down along a twisting walk between patched buildings, stopped at a green-painted door. The little alley was narrow, lined with arched doors and shuttered windows. A glow of light came from behind the next row of houses, and the babble of voices, but here all was quiet.</p>
   <p>“It is the house of my uncle.”</p>
   <p>Alice tapped on the door, and Henry waited. It opened suddenly, and Alice stepped inside, beckoned to Henry. He ducked his head, went through the door into a low-ceilinged room. An old man in dark blue silk pajamas, cotton shoes, and a tiny round cap put his hands together and bobbed his head. Alice spoke rapidly to him; he ducked again, and went out of the room. Alice went to another door, passed through, Henry behind her. They crossed another room, another. There was a rabbit-warren of rooms, some with a table or two, some with mats on the floor, all dimly lit. They emerged in a moonlit courtyard. Tiny beds of flowers lined curving walks of fitted flagstones. Paper lanterns perched on poles reflected in the water springing up in a stone-lined pond where goldfish moved among water lilies. The tinkling of the fountain and faint keening of distant Chinese music were the only sounds. The world seemed to end at the edge of the radiance of the lanterns. Beyond the encircling dark walls shielded by slender date palms, there was nothing . . . .</p>
   <p>Alice turned. “Wait, please, here.” She went to a fragile stair leading up to a gallery with devil-proof points above each column and a roof with flaring turned-up corners, disappeared in the shadows.</p>
   <p>Henry sat on a low bench, leaned against the warm roughness of a lacy sapling, and stared into the black water of the pond. The lights wavered and glittered on its patterned surface. There was a perfume in the air—like honeysuckle, or gardenia—carried by a faint breeze.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>There was a sound and Henry turned. Alice stood before him, eyes downcast. Her hair was unloosed about her shoulders, black as the raven‘s wing against her ivory forehead. There were flowers twined in it, and flowers at her throat, and scattered over the gossamer garment she wore, its perfect transparency artfully obscured by the embroidered blossoms. Henry stared. This was Alice Chan, the icy calm girl at the reception desk? She looked like the fairy princess, the one the trolls captured in the Norwegian fairy tales. The air stirred, pressed the sheer silk against her body, the curve of her hip and thigh…</p>
   <p>“Come … ” she said softly.</p>

    <p>Chapter Eight</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lars scrambled up the slope of the railroad embankment and sank down on a cross-tie. Damned exhausting work, walking in the dark. A damned bore to have to find a spot and lie low, now that daylight was coming. He had been walking for only about five hours; he wasn‘t really tired yet, he could do another couple of hours, then sleep, and go on late in the afternoon. He had been a bit panicked last night, rushing off in a lather like that. The whole thing was a lot of nonsense. Damn Dasgupta, sicking the cops on him. Just went to show you, you couldn‘t trust anyone, even a pal like Das. Oh well, it would make a good story. Tough on Sis, of course; she was so damned serious about everything. He‘d have to make it up to her, afterwards. Get another job, make a real success—and no more falling for a fancy scheme like Dasguptas. It had sounded so simple; sell tickets to Rome, apply for the foreign exchange, then sell the hard currency in the open market at 3:1, cancel the ticket, balance off the books, and split the take with the customer. Who would have ever thought the Finance Ministry would start checking? It wasnt like them; it was downright unfair. Couldnt really blame Das, of course. Tough being an Indian in Samoy. At least he had managed to tip Lars off before the cops arrived, gave him a few minutes to get his thoughts together.</p>
   <p>Well, time to get on. Lars got to his feet, dusted off his trousers. His feet were hurting a little now, after the break. Maybe he should have kept going. How far was it to the border, anyway? Another ninety kilometers? That was still a hell of a hike.</p>
   <p>Lars froze at a movement in the brush, dropped back to the ground. Dacoits? Damn! Why hadn‘t he stuck to the jungle, played it safe. Here he was out in the open, a sitting duck. What the devil to do . . . ? Play it casually, offer them a cigarette, big smiles all around? But Samoyan decoits were a bloodthirsty lot, from all he‘d heard. Maybe they hadn‘t seen him; maybe he could ease back down the slope on this side, beat it into the jungle . . .</p>
   <p>A frond waved, and an animal pushed out into the open, blinking in the sunlight. It was gaunt, mangy, about a meter at the shoulders, Lars estimated; and unmistakably a tiger.</p>
   <p>Lars grinned. What a scare! Just a poor old cat; and he‘d been all ready to take to the brush again. It showed just how foolish it was to be so jumpy. He rose, moved up onto the track, and started off. No one was interested in him. There was nothing to worry about. The cat was watching him. Suddenly it sat on its haunches and scratched ponderously at an ear with a clumsy hind foot. A tiger! Some tiger . . . He had pictured something a lot more impressive when he had gone out on those hunting excursions with that Anglo chap, Howard, and the others. Still, the damned creature was staring at him rather intently. He was almost abreast of the animal now; it made him nervous, looking at him like that.</p>
   <p>As Lars passed, glancing back, the tiger rose and followed, padding silently along, at the base of the embankment, thirty feet from the man above. Lars stopped abruptly, stamped a foot. “Shoo, cat!” He waved his arms. The tiger stopped, pricked up his ears alertly, then lowered his head, his eyes on those of the man. Lars felt sweat pop out on his forehead. He unbuttoned the flap on a hip pocket and took out the pistol. He glanced at it, worked the action. A .25 calibre pistol against a tiger. But it was silly of course; the creature was merely curious. He would just go on quietly, and soon it would lose interest. He started on, the pistol in his hand.</p>
   <p>The tiger loped forward suddenly, with astonishing grace, and bounded up the slope twenty feet behind Lars. Lars kept going, looking back. The thing was so close he could see the fleas moving about in the stiff white fur between the eyes. Now the animal moved confidently toward him, head up. Lars stopped, released the safety on the pistol. The tiger stopped, no more than fifteen feet away now. If he turned his back now the tiger would spring. And if he moved toward the tiger, made a threatening motion—it was fifty-fifty, whether it would flee or charge. And if he stood here staring . . .</p>
   <p>There was only one thing to do, and do it fast, while he had the chance. Lars raised the pistol, took careful aim at the inner corner of the right eye, and pulled the trigger.</p>
   <p>The boom of the weapon was unexpectedly loud. The cat leaped straight into the air, flipped over, and rolled down the embankment in a cloud of dust, loose limbs flailing, to slam against the bole of a vine-hung tree, and lie still.</p>
   <p>Lars licked his lips, wiped his forehead with the back of his hand. He looked at the pistol, put it back in his pocket and carefully buttoned the flap. Well, what about that now? One shot; he‘d made a clean kill of a tiger with one round from a pea-shooter. What a lark! They‘d never believe him. He‘d better go down and collect a trophy . . . but then, maybe he‘d better be getting along. If there were any dacoits in the area, they‘d be along to investigate the shot; they were supposed to be fonder of stealing guns than money. But Sis would believe him. Wouldn‘t this be something to tell her, when this was all over? Good old Sis. She was a prize. Maybe the American chap would marry her; that would be jolly. She was pretty sweet on him, and he was a good fellow—hadnt he given him the gun?</p>
   <p>Lars moved off along the tracks. Another hour or two, then a good sleep, and another night—and tomorrow morning hed cross the border. Nothing to it.</p>
   <subtitle>2</subtitle>
   <p>Bert looked at the framed beach scene on his office wall, not seeing it. It was a damned shame, a girl like Marie, wasted on a clod like Henry Cummins. He took a deep breath; he‘d better get his mind on his work. There‘d be lots more evenings with Marie. After all, it was just getting started. And it wasn‘t just the pressure he‘d put on her that would make her deliver, either. It was Bert Sutton himself. After Henry, she would appreciate a man that knew what the hell he was doing. It was tough, having to wait. But the pay-off would be worth it.</p>
   <p>Bert thought of the bland, empty faces of the Embassy staff, all well-fed, worried, dumb. If they only knew what an operator he really was . . . . Sure, they knew he was smart, efficient, on top of his job; but they probably thought he was as bland and conventional as they were. Stuffy Harvey Throst, solemn Zwicker, and the rest of them. What did they know? They wouldn‘t even believe it if he told them.</p>
   <p>No, it wasn‘t necessary to conform—just to appear to conform. Bert chuckled. That was well put, and rather subtle. He was one man against an organized society of clods; since he couldnt overwhelm them, he had to outsmart them.</p>
   <p>Take Bayard. He was going to set out now to smear Bert Sutton, was he, to blemish that perfect record, built up with so many years of efficient, faithful service. It was tragic, to think that a nobody like Bayard could stand down at his level and toss mud up onto the spotless record of a dedicated man like himself. It was a rotten thing, that part of the Service, that a fourteen year career of devoted duty could actually be threatened by the wild talk of a disgruntled underling. But there it was, one of these things you had to face in this life. There was no justice, no noble abstraction that rewarded virtue. No, he‘d have to get in there and fight, just as much as if he were in the wrong. Bayard was a fool to tip his hand. He would go up against the Admin Officer, would he? Well, a little talk with Brad Paine ought to undercut that very nicely. Forewarned of the persecution campaign, he would know how to handle any alleged dirt Bayard and his cronies might bring to him. And this item would be just what the file needed to hang Bayard once and for all.</p>
   <p>Bert pushed the buzzer. Might as well jot down a memo on this now. He should have done it yesterday, as soon as Bayard made his threat, but at the time he hadn‘t thought it through. But now it was all clear; the damned infernal gall of the fellow, threatening Bert Sutton, a man who could have women like Marie Cummins just by the lifting of a finger . . .</p>
   <p>Mabel tapped and came in. She was wearing her usual frown. There was something almost insolent in the way she slouched across the room, stood there dumbly. Why couldn‘t she look eager to please? Didn‘t she know Bert Sutton could break her? And no effort to look her best, either, the slovenly bitch! Did she think Bert Sutton, who had women like Marie whenever he wanted them, needed her? Her crummy appearance was an affront to him; a deliberate one . . .</p>
   <p>“Mabel, why don‘t you take the day off today—</p>
   <p>Mabel looked at him, startled.</p>
   <p>“Go to a beauty shop; get your hair fixed; or at least combed. Buy a dress; on your salary, you can afford a decent garment to wear to the office. And try to come back tomorrow looking like the secretary of the Admin Officer, instead of a garbage woman!”</p>
   <p>Mabel‘s mouth was open, her face screwing up. Bert stared at her, the good healthy anger burning through him.</p>
   <p>“And when you come back, try getting caught up on your work. Clean out your desk, and you might even do a little dusting. This is the office of the Admin Officer, not some—</p>
   <p>Mabel turned and stamped from the room. Bert opened his mouth to call after her, hesitated, let it go. Who the hell told her she could leave? But it didn‘t matter. She was hopeless. Anyway, maybe there‘d be a little improvement now. But you could never tell with these clerks; the crazy woman might run to Paine, start telling some wild tale about him. Maybe he shouldn‘t have been quite so outspoken. Why the hell did he have to get her started now, with Bayard pushing his hate campaign? But to hell with Mabel. Let her whine. A man who had women like Marie falling for him was above being concerned about anything Mabel could say. And right now, there was work to be done. He‘d have to see Paine right away, and then, when Mabel calmed down a little, he‘d have to get that memo on Bayard into the file.</p>

   <p>Henry Cummins left the Embassy by the side entrance and took the car to the Grand Hotel for lunch. No Chinese food for him today—not after last night.</p>
   <p>He unfolded his copy of the New State and glanced over the front page. There was a big write-up on the airline scandal. That was something; the office was right across the street from the Embassy. The fellow who ran off with the money was probably some slick operator with a huge pile stashed in a bank in Switzerland under an assumed name. Probably left on one of his own flights, first-class, while the police fumbled around. By now he was sitting pretty somewhere. A little crookedness could sure pay off sometimes.</p>
   <p>Down below, there was a short item about a dead tiger found near Pamsit Village, by the crew of the early morning train from Ludo. It was lying alongside the tracks, not twenty miles from the city. Henry looked out the window at the reeking slum that had once been a great city‘s main street. The jungle was close, here in Samoy. Twenty miles away, wild tigers roamed, and even here in the city, the grasses were reclaiming the streets. The Embassy people thought they were a lot farther from the jungle, but they weren‘t. They had a jungle of their own with the same old struggle going on. He was learning the rules now. The lessons were costly, but he would show them that if the rest of them shared a jungle heritage, he had a part of it, too.</p>

   <p>Tom Hurd leaned back in his chair, propped his feet on the desk, and plucked a match from his shirt pocket. Carefully, he peeled two fibres from it, then put it between his teeth. By Gosh, this was something to think over real careful, now. Not like Bert to blow his stack like that, get one of the secretaries all steamed up. Of course he‘d have to get with Bert right away, get the whole story; but there was an angle here he couldn‘t quite dope out. From what Mabel said, Bert was way out on a limb there, with those personal cracks and all. Mabel probably had it coming, all right—probably asked for it—but still if Bert was losing his touch with the clerical staff, he was headed for trouble; that could wreck a guy with the inspectors quicker than anything. And old Tom Hurd didnt have any intentions of being pulled under with Bert.</p>
   <p>This might be just one of those things; Bert might still be in the saddle, but it wouldn‘t be a bad idea for a smart guy to start covering himself in the record. Should have done it a long time ago.</p>
   <p>Tom spat out the match. When Tom Hurd went in with somebody, he expected him to be smart, keep himself covered. As long as Bert played it along shrewd, sucked up to Paine and the Ambassador, and babied the clerks along, OK. That was the way to get ahead. But Hurd wasn‘t the man to go down with a sinking ship. Oh, he didn‘t have to pull anything dumb, louse things up with Bert—not after all the time he had in this project—but it was time to smarten up, get a little insurance ready.</p>
   <p>Tom opened his desk, took out a manila folder. He rolled a sheet of paper into his typewriter. “Memo for the Record” he tapped out. He frowned, pecked at the keys with gnarled forefingers. “Shortly after 1 A.M., Miss Mabel Wisnieski came into my office close to tears . . . .”</p>

   <p>Bradley Paine picked up the telephone impatiently. He could do without this infernal jangling just now. “Excuse me, gentlemen. Yes?”</p>
   <p>“Alice Chan just called—General Winjee is on his way up—</p>
   <p>“Didn‘t you tell her I was occupied?” Paine glanced at the three Congressmen, forced a troubled smile. What a time for Winjee to drop in . . .</p>
   <p>“Alice said he just brushed right past her and started up, Mr. Paine. I‘m sorry … ”</p>
   <p>“Quite all right, Nancy; not your fault, I‘m sure. Ask the General to have a seat for just a few minutes.”</p>
   <p>“What‘s this, some local military man paying a visit?” Hodges looked as though he were on the scent of something. It would be very desirable to keep Winjee away from the legislators; they wouldn‘t understand his excitable nature, his habit of exaggeration, bombastic talk.</p>
   <p>“General Winjee, Head of the Samoyan army; he drops in now and again for a chat. But in regard to the question of payments, Mr. Alpin—</p>
   <p>“Here, why don‘t we meet this fellow,” Hodges said, looking at Alpin. “Find out first hand what this insurgent business is all about, what the Commies are up to?”</p>
   <p>“You should understand, Mr. Hodges,” Paine put in, “General Winjee is a barracks soldier; he hasn‘t been active in—</p>
   <p>“We‘d betteer stick to our program, Herb,” Alpin said. “We have a lot of ground to cover. Now Paine, you‘ve said on the previous ICA loan, there had to be some soft currency and barter arrangement worked out … ”</p>
   <p>Paine replied to Alpin‘s probings with a sense of relief. The man had a way of getting right in to the tender spots in a hurry, but at least he was on familiar ground. There was no telling what Winjee might have blurted out, but thank God Hodges hadn‘t been insistent. It was—</p>
   <p>The door opened noisily, and Paine saw Nancy‘s indignant face over Winjee‘s shoulder.</p>
   <p>“Ah, Bradley! Excuse my dropping over . . . . I hope you are not busy . . . .” Winjee stared at the Congressmen. Paine rose. Good God; this was a disaster. But if he could keep Winjee on the subject of golf or bridge, and away from the arms agreement . . .</p>
   <p>Winjee shook hands jerkily with the visitors, wiping his hand on the side of his trousers after each grip. He sank into a chair against the wall, lit a cigarette, puffed out smoke. As an afterthought, he thrust the pack toward Paine, then the others.</p>
   <p>“Cigarette! Samoyan cigarettes; real Virginia tobacco.” He stuffed the pack back in his tunic pocket, slid down in the chair and crossed his legs; his foot jiggled frantically. There was momentary silence.</p>
   <p>“Well, Bradley, the agreement is all signed and completed now, eh?” Winjee spat out a shred of tobacco. “A good thing, too, just in the nick of time.”</p>
   <p>Hodges looked at Paine. Paine smiled stiffly. “Ah, there was no real urgency about the matter, I‘m sure, General—</p>
   <p>“We‘ll have a surprise ready for those fellows, Bradley, eh?” Winjee cackled gleefully. He sat up, shifted the cigarette to the other hand. “Ho, the look on their faces when they come right up against armored cars . . . machine guns . . . automatic rifles! We‘ll teach them a lesson once and for all! They‘re a mob with stones and dahs, nothing more. What a job we‘ll do on that riff-raff with a nice machine gun emplacement shooting right down into them. Just like the book, Bradley. The long axis of the beaten zone coinciding with the long axis of the target—</p>
   <p>“Now, General,” Paine began.</p>
   <p>“Who‘s going to be doing all this shooting— Hodges started.</p>
   <p>Alpin leaned forward, drowned out Hodges. “Paine, is this fellow talking about the use to which U.S. supplied arms will be put?”</p>
   <p>“Don‘t be alarmed, Mr. Alpin. General Winjee merely means—</p>
   <p>“Only Communists, Mr. Ahh … “ Winjee waved his cigarette expansively. “U.S. guns to kill Communists with. What better use for them, eh? And those fellows at the Russian Embassy; some fireworks from them, too, we‘ll be hearing.”</p>
   <p>“I understood we were supplying police equipment, Paine; supposed to help maintain law and order, guard the mines, that sort of thing, protect American interests. What‘s all this about tanks and machine guns?”</p>
   <p>“Well, as to the actual composition of the technical—</p>
   <p>“Grenades!” Winjee said. “Mortars! Rockets! Half-tracks! We‘ll do a clean-up job here straight away, set these bad hats right once and for all!” Winjee stubbed out his cigarette on the floor, got out a fresh one.</p>
   <p>Alpin was on his feet. “I think we‘d better see the Ambassador on this, Paine; right away!” He turned to Whipple. “I don‘t know what we‘ve gotten into here … ”</p>
   <p>Paine got to his feet. “Gentlemen, the Ambassador will—</p>
   <p>Alpin brushed past him, Whipple and Hodges trailing. Paine went back to his desk numbly, sat down. He had to think . . .</p>
   <p>“These are U.S. Congressmen, Bradley? Strange kind of chaps, if you don‘t mind my saying so. What I really came to see you about, Bradley, what about a round of golf this afternoon, eh?”</p>

   <p>Marshal-to-be Yin-Yin threw the newspaper on the floor. “Oon!” He slapped the desk with his palm. Where was the fool?</p>
   <p>Oon padded into the room, sleepy-eyed, hair awry.</p>
   <p>“You sleep now, pig, while on duty? While I, Marshal Yin-Yin—</p>
   <p>“Do not abuse me, Yin-Yin. Even the proud must sleep. What do you want?” Oon yawned.</p>
   <p>“Some fools do not know how to obey orders. Today a dead animal is found on the Ludo rail line—shot!</p>
   <p>“What—</p>
   <p>“When I gave the order calling all units to the city, did I not command there would be no shooting, nothing to draw attention to our men? Yet now someone is shooting off guns at wild animals in Ludo township—a few miles from the city!</p>
   <p>“But Yin-Yin, maybe it is not our men—</p>
   <p>“Who else has a gun, fool! No villager would dare. By now all have learned to have a gun is to be marked for killing. No; one of our men shot the creature.”</p>
   <p>“Perhaps a foreigner, a hunter—</p>
   <p>“And left the carcass, hide and all? Idiot! Cease arguing! Let me go there, find the disobedient ones, and take action.”</p>
   <p>“What action?”</p>
   <p>Yin-Yin smiled. “Send Koom and his brothers. They will know what action to take with mutinous dogs.”</p>
   <p>“Koom! But— Oon hesitated. I will do what you say, Yin-Yin. He hurried away.</p>
   <subtitle>7</subtitle>
   <p>. . . I picked up the newspaper and saw an item on the front page about a dead tiger found lying beside the tracks a few miles out of the city, and it reminded me again of Lars Lund, a happy-go-lucky kid who used to play at tiger hunting, out there now on a tough trek, alone, with more tough times ahead before he was clear of this mess. I thought about Ingred, always so cool and always either smiling or just about to, and how she had worried about her kid brother and how right she had been.</p>
   <p>She had held up fine right up until we pulled into the drive and sat there and looked at the dark house where she would be staying alone now, and then she broke down and cried just as hard as she had been smiling up till then. I didn‘t try to kid her along with any happy talk; Lars was in plenty of trouble and we both knew it. I just gave her a shoulder to cry on and let her cry it out.</p>
   <p>She stopped after a while and wiped tears from her face and even then she was pretty, which is a lot to say for any woman‘s looks.</p>
   <p>“Brion,” she said. “You must stay here tonight with me. I have never stayed here alone. I am afraid.”</p>
   <p>I turned over a few fast thoughts about conventional people and young women‘s reputations and my own reliability under the circumstances.</p>
   <p>“Sure,” I said. “And thanks for the compliment.”</p>
   <p>We went inside and made coffee and moved a spare bed into Ingred‘s bedroom and she got into her bed and I got into mine and stayed there till dawn, so help me. I left early to try to beat the gossips, and came on down to the office; but it looked like another long day.</p>

   <p>Horace Zwicker marked the tiger item for clipping, placed the newspaper in his OUT basket. That finished up the papers; now would be as good a time as any to try to get through a few of the new NIS reports before the end of the day. Some political officers—not excluding members of his own section—ignored such sources, so important to their background briefing. They were very foolish to do so; in this business, it was your broadly informed officer who rose to the top, while the others floundered, never quite able to grasp the flow of events. It was background, plus alertness to pick up your significant detail in the days happenings, that counted. It was important to watch all sources of information; a word here, a hint there, viewed in the light of wide knowledge—that was what produced your keen analysis, your penetrating commentary that rang a bell in the Department. That fellow Zwicker, theyd say. An incisive mind. Its almost uncanny the way he can spot these trends, sense coming events.</p>
   <p>Like the tiger item. Your pedestrian minds—like Clint Lewis—would read that and pass on, ignore it. It was a dead tiger, nothing else. But not your alert political officer; not Horace Zwicker. He could imagine Clint peering at him dumbly, desperately eager to know what his wiser colleague saw in the item. This tiger item, hed say, and wait for Zwicker to volunteer something. Eventually hed come out with it. What do you see in the tiger item, Zwicker? Whats the significance?</p>
   <p>“Why, nothing to it, really, Clint. You noted the beast was shot; the use of a firearm indicates dacoit activity in the area … ”</p>
   <p>“But it might be anybody—</p>
   <p>“Your villager wouldn‘t keep a gun in his possession—dacoit bands kill to get them—</p>
   <p>“Or insurgents—or army men!</p>
   <p>“The insurgency is largely a convenient fiction maintained by the Samoyan government to explain their failures, Clint. And their presence in an area is invariably marked by political activity in the villages; sabotage, and so on. Ludo township is extremely quiet just now. As for the Army—there is no garrison in the area, and no movements of troops have occurred, pending the anticipated disturbances.</p>
   <p>“But dacoits, Zwicker; if they‘re responsible, why haven‘t we heard about any raids?”</p>
   <p>“There you have the real significance of the item, Clint—the reason for my interest. You see, it means your dacoits are there—but under cover. Why would they be concealing their presence? Because of a build-up in strength, in preparation for a major raid of some sort. Quite possibly Wednesday Inter-nation Express from Bangkok. A rich haul.</p>
   <p>“My God, Zwicker, all this from a dead tiger!”</p>
   <p>Zwicker laughed deprecatingly. “Routine, Clint,” he said aloud. He glanced about. No one had noticed him talking to himself. An embarrassing habit he was getting into; he must do something about it.</p>
   <p>But that was as close as Clint Lewis would come to getting secrets from Horace Zwicker.</p>

   <p>It was fifteen after five, and everyone had left the building now, Alice Chan thought, except for a few who always stayed late, like Mr. Hurd. And all day she had not seen Henry, and now it was time for her to go. It was sad to go thus, alone, back to the poor house of her father. She hoped the strange men would not be there, with their harsh looks and stealthy ways. And the little she had overheard of their talk—of some great evil they were to commit—it too was frightening. What had her father to do with their plots? Always before she had accepted without thought whatever her father might choose to do, but now—it was something one learned when one was of the Embassy; she had begun to think a little of things. And this coming of strangers by night: it was not a good thing. She would ask Henry what it meant; he would know. He would tell her what she must do, so that the evil men would go from her fathers house and leave them in peace. And if she had not seen him today—no matter. Tomorrow he would surely come.</p>
   <subtitle>10</subtitle>
   <p>A sharp twig was poking into his back, and Lars Lund stirred, turned on his side, and opened his eyes.</p>
   <p>Almost sundown; he hadn‘t meant to sleep so long. Time to be getting on. He must have been more tired than he thought. He stood up stiffly, brushing leaf mould from his clothes. One advantage to sleeping in one‘s clothes—there was nothing to delay ones getting started. Lars emerged from the shade of the trees and scrambled up the slope of the railroad embankment. With a gibbous moon tonight he would have no difficulty making his way along the tracks; and by early morning he would be there. If it werent for the damned blisters, hed feel fine.</p>
   <p>Lars walked along, stepping on the ties. It was necessary to stretch his legs slightly for each step; it was a tiring way to have to walk. He moved over to the side, walking on the loose gravel ballast. The embankment was narrow here; damned difficult footing. Maybe it would be better to go down and travel along the base of the embankment. But it would be darker there, under the overhanging trees. He‘s have to stay up here and do the best he could.</p>
   <p>It was a beautiful evening. The trees were black against a greenish sky. It was cooler now, too. Birds crying far off in the forest made the only sound—that and the crunch of gravel underfoot. Lonesome out here. How often did a train go by? He had been a damned fool to play games with the foreign exchange market. At home now, Sis would be getting a good dinner on the table for him; canned ham from home, and cheese, and a bottle or two of Three Crowns. Afterwards out to a party, a little fun with little Greta from the West German legation. She liked him, that one did. Funny, he wouldnt be seeing her again. What would she say when she heard about him? Probably think he was a bloody fool. And shed be right.</p>
   <p>It was dark now, with a few clouds. It would be awkward if they obscured the moon; it was all he could do to see where he was going now. It wouldn‘t do to have a fall, twist an ankle. It was like the bloody Samoyans to start out with a broad, well surfaced right-of-way, and dwindle off to this goat-track as soon as they were well away from the capital. He hadn‘t realized how well off he was last night.</p>
   <p>Time for a rest. Must have made several miles already, at least, since dark. The legs feel like it. Feet are a little better, though, not so stiff. The first thing he would do tomorrow, once he was happily situated in a good hotel, would be to soak those poor feet. Then out for a good dinner before checking in with the SAS office. Then a show, a few drinks in a nice bar . . . . Who knows what might turn up? But first, the feet Another fifty kilometers maybe; that sounded like a lot, but—</p>
   <p>Lars cocked his head, listening. There was something moving in the jungle, right off there; moving this way. God! not another tiger! It couldn‘t be; that one yesterday—or early this morning; it seemed like a week—that had been a freak, there were no tigers normally in this region. Lars stopped, took out the automatic. He wouldnt be so lucky, in the dark. If it was a tiger, he was finished.</p>
   <p>The sounds continued, came closer. No use just standing here; better to get moving. Maybe there‘d be a village ahead, he might get help. Lars started off at a trot, stumbling at first, then getting the feel of the tie spacing.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>How much longer? It was hard to breathe, his throat was so dry. How long had he been running? Surely two kilometers or more. He couldn‘t keep it up. He‘d have to stop and catch his breath, tiger or no tiger. Lars slowed, stumbled, and fell sprawling. Now that he was still, it was harder than ever to breathe. He was suffocating. He struggled to a sitting position, and saw, back down the track in the direction from which he had come, a dim light from a bobbing lantern. Men! Good God, and he had nearly run himself to death. What a fool to be so jumpy. Tigers!</p>
   <p>Lars stood up, still gasping for breath, and waited. He heard voices now, a few muttered words. Someone was coming along the tracks, and there were others moving along below, at the edge of the undergrowth. Probably they were a group of villagers, returning home from merry-making or whatever villagers did in their spare time. Their village must be nearby, and he could get a guide, borrow a lantern—</p>
   <p>There was an abrupt shout from the man on the tracks, and the lantern stopped. Lars could dimly make out the figure of the man holding it. He was a big fellow for a Samoyan. Lars moved a step toward him. “Hullo, there!”</p>
   <p>There was no reply, no sound. No one moved. They must be afraid of him, Lars thought. Samoyans were a timid lot . . .</p>
   <p>Someone was moving now, down below. Dark, down there. Couldn‘t see a thing. How the devil did they manage? Probably they were used to this jungle wandering, could see in the dark. That‘s what he needed, a guide . . .</p>
   <p>“Come here,” Lars called cheerily. “Sah‘b need guide. Pay money. Many Kots … ”</p>
   <p>There was a scramble of feet to his right, on the left, too. The man with the lantern didn‘t move. Lars reached into his pocket for a loose 5-Kot note. He would wave it, and they‘d understand well enough, even if they didn‘t know English—</p>
   <p>A sudden movement, and he was struck from behind, wiry arms clamped around his waist, he was being pushed, stumbling down on his knees against sharp gravel and the numbing blow of the cross tie on his knee-cap, the animal stink of an unwashed Samoyan; Lars twisted, struck out, felt horny palms against his face, and another weight struck him, knocking him flat, grinding his face against cutting stones.</p>
   <p>He fought back, silently. Find a skinny wrist, yank and twist it, punch at the dark with a free hand, guard the tender face with a shoulder, strain with his legs against their weight, smothering him. Then more hands on his arms, legs, holding him down, the lantern glaring into his eyes, and a broad cross-eyed face looking down at him from above. He relaxed, went limp. His own breathing was loud and harsh. What the devil was going on? Thieves? Dacoits? Or were they just afraid of a stranger. Maybe they‘d never seen a white man, thought he was some kind of spook . . .</p>
   <p>Lars smiled broadly. Got to show these fellows he was friendly. In a minute they‘d see they‘d made a mistake, let him up, apologize, offer him food and native beer, form a procession—</p>
   <p>Lars yelped as agony exploded in his side, driving out his breath; he twisted, felt more blows dimly, and a ringing sound filled everything. He felt the hard hands pulling him to his feet, pain stabbing from his side. He tried to pull away, tend the hurt; they yanked, dragging him along, down the embankment, through brush. His side . . . .</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>He must have been unconscious. Not asleep—that was quite different. His thoughts were heavy, sluggish, hard to hold. The police had been after him he remembered. Something about the tickets. The telephone rang, and he had tried to hide among the trees, and then he was running along the tracks, putting things into his pockets as he ran, trying to call out to Sis, and to Greta that he would be back . . .</p>
   <p>No, that was all wrong. It was a tiger looking at him, and big black fleas moving busily in the yellowish white fur. The eyes were like lanterns, gleaming in the dark, and the others were all around. The tiger‘s eyes were crossed. Odd-looking beast! But Lars had a pistol. Hadn‘t he shot the lantern? He remembered the light going out, the tiger rolling down the slope. Lars opened his eyes.</p>
   <p>It was dark and a native was lying curled beside a glowing fire, a pair of shoes beside him. A mosquito whined close to Lars‘ head; he moved to brush it away, and felt the cutting of something that bound his wrists behind him. His head ached, and his side . . . . Now he remembered; the cross-eyed devil with the lantern had kicked him. Must have broken a rib or two. God, how it hurt. And his face; it felt dead, numb, except for the itching. One eye felt as if it were gouged out. Couldn‘t help trying to blink it, and that made it ache. Nice mess he‘d gotten himself into this time. Why the hell hadn‘t he hid out, instead of standing up there like an idiot and letting them take him? Never figured the police would really come after him; thought he was well away. Just goes to show you can never be sure of anything. It wasn‘t fair; just because he hadn‘t suspected anything, they had gotten him, whereas if he had only lain low for a while . . .</p>
   <p>Oh, well, that was that. His face hurt. The side was the worse injury, probably, but if he lay still it wasn‘t too bad. But it was hard not to think about your face. Hope it wasn‘t cut up too badly; hate to be an eyesore to others. And what would Sis say? Poor Sis. She‘d feel rotten about all this. Funny it hadn‘t even occurred to him they might be cops; he was so sure he was clear.</p>
   <p>Where were the rest of them? There had been four or five, at least. There was his pistol, stuck in that fellow‘s belt. Villainous looking devil; must be some sort of native constabulary; no uniforms. Probably a great coup for them, bringing him in. Would he have to walk all the way back now? God, what a thought! With his feet, and now the side, walking would be torture. And after he‘d come well over half way. It wasn‘t fair.</p>
   <p>Lars moved his wrists, tugging at the bindings. Felt like a strap; too smooth for rope. Yes, a leather strap, some sort of fancy buckle. At a thought, he looked down, squinting. Hard to see anything, but his belt was missing; they‘d used it to tie him. Neat, that. But how had they secured the thing? It was one of those buckles that release when you lifted the edge. Maybe . . .</p>
   <p>If he strained, he could just get a fingernail under the edge. Was it the right edge? Let‘s see . . . yes, that‘s right. Just flip it up. The damned thing was pressed tight against the leather, but surely . . .</p>
   <p>Lars was perspiring now, breathing shallowly. Hope could be an unpleasant emotion, under these circumstances. Get a finger under the damnable thing and lift. God, it hurt! Damn flimsy fingernails! But no matter, dig in! Try another finger! Twist, and force . . . .</p>
   <p>The buckle gave, lifted, the leather slipping. What a relief! His hands were cold, stiff. It was hard to fumble them free from the loosened coil of leather. Wonderful to reach up and touch his face. God, his hands were dead, like ice, great lumps of dead meat.. How long had they had him strapped up? But he could move them a little; they were all right.</p>
   <p>He was on his knees now; they hadn‘t tied his feet. Why not? Very sure of themselves, these chaps. Not as smart as they thought, though. Samoyans never were. Now if he could just get to his feet and—</p>
   <p>The fellow at the fire stirred and opened his eyes, staring at Lars. He sat up slowly, plucked the pistol from his waist band. Lars lunged, swinging as he struck. His loosely doubled fist missed as the man dodged, and Lars‘ elbow caught him square across the jaw. The man folded; Lars got to his feet, took two steps. Which way? He had a feeling it was over there, but . . .</p>
   <p>The pistol. Better grab it. Where were the others? Never mind, get out of here. He picked up the gun clumsily, poked it into a side pocket, and struck off into the darkness.</p>

    <p>Chapter Nine</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Standing at the rail watching the gent in the white shirt coming up the gangway, Grigson was sure he was an American. He was getting to where he could spot ‘em, all right. Glad to see one right now, too. This Samoy didn‘t look like much; a man hardly knew what to do to get in touch with things. He sure didn‘t feel like walking off the ship, without some kind of plans on how to get to the Embassy, at least. He learned his lesson in Colombo, you could count on that. Boy, what a place to be stranded in, not to mention the expense. He was lucky to even get on this tub. Five days to Samoy—and the smell of the scow . . . lucky he was a good sailor.</p>
   <p>Anyway, this was a break, spotting an American; better not let him get out of sight. Grigson moved along the rail and came up behind the stranger. He tapped him on the shoulder.</p>
   <p>“Pardon me, friend. Don‘t you hail from the U.S.A.?”</p>
   <p>The stranger turned around and looked at him. For just a minute, it looked like he‘d made a mistake. Grigson‘s smile faded a little. Felt a little silly, standing here holding his hand out . . .</p>
   <p>“Yes, that‘s correct.”</p>
   <p>“I‘m Harold P. Grigson. Call me Harry. Knew you were from the U.S.A. the minute I laid eyes on you.”</p>
   <p>The stranger nodded, adjusting his glasses. It looked like he was going to turn away . . .</p>
   <p>“I didn‘t catch your name, stranger,” Grigson said, dropping his hand to his side.</p>
   <p>“Jakes; nice meeting you, Mr. Grigson.” the stranger said over his shoulder.</p>
   <p>Well, this was a little better. Feller was probably a little shy; not like a businessman, who had to be a mixer. Harry would put him at his ease.</p>
   <p>“Well, it‘s good to find another American out here, Jake. Long way from home, eh? I‘m from Rantoul, Illinois, lumber business. What‘s your line?”</p>
   <p>The feller was looking past him, and nodding. “Excuse me; my mail is coming off now.” He walked away. Friendly cuss! Grigson watched the cargo net rising, swinging over the side with a load of weathered grey mailbags. This bird sure got a lot of mail, if that was all his. Must be doing a whale of a business. What line was he in, anyway? Grigson moved to his side at the rail, pointed with his cigar at the net.</p>
   <p>“What‘s your line, Jake? I‘m a stranger out here, myself. Don‘t know a thing about the local situation. Now, seeing as you‘re already established out here, maybe—</p>
   <p>“I have to rush along,” the stranger said. “Good morning.” He went off down the gangplank. Grigson watched as he went up to the coolies opening the net and spoke to one with a white rag wrapped around his head like a turban. Feller sure gave him the brush-off. But at least he ought to find out . . .</p>
   <p>“Hey, Jake,” Brigson called. “How does a feller get over to the U.S. Embassy?”</p>
   <p>The American looked up, settled his glasses. “‘After you pass the gate, over there—just to your left, along Mackenzie Street.</p>
   <p>“Any taxis or busses or— Grigson fell silent, watched the bird walking off, right in the middle of what he was saying. Must be some kind of damned renegade American. Never saw anything like it before. Here came a car, pulling up alongside the guy, little man jumping out, opening the door. Must be some kind of big shot. Something on the side of the car, a round emblem, looked like the old NRA emblem; what did it say? Grigson peered at the car as it moved off.</p>
   <p>“Embassy,” he read, “of the United States . . . of America … “ Grigson stared after the car as it swung off along the wharf and through the gate. By God, that fellow could have given him a lift right to the Embassy! He‘d have a word to say to the U. S. Consul about this . . . .</p>

   <p>Strange, Lars Lund thought: made all that distance through the jungle—maybe a mile of it—ran into the railroad again in the dark, and never noticed his shoes were missing until the damned stones started cutting in. Even then, the side was what hurt most. Now, when he had only a kilometer or two at most to go—surely it couldnt be farther than that—his feet were failing him. Always been a fine walker, good pair of feet; but that was with shoes on, not barefooted over jungle saw-grass and thorns, then running and walking, running and walking, on sharp stones. Too weak now to stride along from tie to tie, damn it. Too weak to do anything much, maybe too weak even to get to his feet again. Pretty silly; it wasnt the broken ribs or the concussion or the loss of blood; just the damned feet.</p>
   <p>Couldn‘t just sit here, though. Must be ten in the morning. Expected to be there long before now. Those confounded thugs might come along any moment. Wonder if they really were cops? Couldn‘t give up now. Maybe have another go at it with rags tied around the feet. Tear up the shirt; cut a pretty strange figure at the border, but what the hell . . . .</p>
   <subtitle>3</subtitle>
   <p>A confounded nuisance, Ben Jakes thought, hanging his jacket on the clothes tree behind his desk. Hardly an appropriate task for a Second Secretary, boarding that disorderly boat and shepherding surface pouches. Even if Cummins were tied up as Escort Officer to the Congressional delegation, surely he could have found time to attend to his regular duties; or they could have sent Bayard, or anyone. Why take the time of an officer with responsibilities such as his own? He shot a resentful look across at Bayard, leaning back in his chair pretending to be reading last year‘s CERP binder. If the fellow were a more experienced man, who could share the burden . . . But no, he managed to take up his entire day with administrative detail and routine matters—when, if he had any initiative at all, he would have turned the bulk of such work over to Nabi and the others downstairs, long ago. If he himself had time . . . But he was perpetually harassed, of course; the protocol work alone during the present visit was enough to tire an ordinary man.</p>
   <p>Jakes sighed, settled himself, and pressed the buzzer on his desk. A girl appeared at the door.</p>
   <p>“Oh, Ann; bring in the Classified Despatch binder.” He drummed on the desk top, waiting. The girl reappeared.</p>
   <p>“Mr. Jakes, there‘s a gentleman to see you.”</p>
   <p>Jakes narrowed his eyes, craned to see past Ann. “Where is he?”</p>
   <p>“Downstairs; at Alice Chan‘s desk.”</p>
   <p>“Hmmm. See what it is he wants; send him down to the library to Nabi. Really, I‘m extremely busy this morning.” Ann disappeared. Who might this be, wanting to see him? Probably another Samoyan entrepreneur, with a few acres of barren ground a hundred miles inside insurgent territory which he desired to convert into a tin mine with the aid of U.S. capital. Or maybe it was another would-be importer, with grandiose ideas about establishing a line of credit in the U.S., and on the basis of that, wrangling an import license for a few hundred thousand dollars worth of merchandise. Of course, he would then sell the license to some Chinese who would use it to bring in strategic materials for re-export to Red China. The same old gambits, and each one apparently thought it was a new notion.</p>
   <p>Ann returned. “It‘s a gentleman who‘s interested in investing in timber; he insists on seeing the Commercial Officer; he was directed by somebody down in Admin—</p>
   <p>“Oh, very well, Ann. I‘ll see him.” Well; investment. That could be different. Commerce was always delighted when an officer in the field stirred up a little investment activity. It fitted in with someone‘s current idea of expediency, back in Washington. Whoever read the report from the post would take all the credit, of course; but then he would pass along a good report-evaluation on Jakes, so it was all quite equitable. Now if—</p>
   <p>Ann stood in the door, gesturing someone in; Jakes rose, adjusting his glasses, and—good heavens! The impossible tourist from the boat . . . had he forced his way in ahead of the other . . . ? could it be . . . ?</p>
   <p>“Oh, ah . . . why it‘s Mr. Grigson . . . . Isn‘t this a pleasure . . . .” Jakes waved a hand. “This is my colleague. Mr. Bayard . . . Do sit down, Mr. Grigson … “ What a ghastly situation. How could he have known? The man had shot a look at Bayard, turned back to glare at Jakes. Why didn‘t Bayard say something to ease the situation?</p>
   <p>But then Grigson wasn‘t anybody of importance, had no pull in Washington, or there‘d have been a circular airgram on him, alerting the post, the full treatment.</p>
   <p>“Well, Jake,” Grigson snapped. He sounded mad. “Didn‘t expect to see you again so quick, after the way you were in such an infernal hurry down at the ship.”</p>
   <p>“I . . . ah . . . you really must excuse me, Mr. Grigson. The . . . ah . . . diplomatic pouches, you understand. Sorry to have rushed off, but with diplomatic pouches under my care . . . Well, actually, you‘ll understand that one must be extremely careful. The diplomatic pouches, quite a responsibillity. Here in such a primitive land, one never knows … “ Jakes adjusted his glasses and smiled confidingly. Why didn‘t Grigson thaw? He was still standing there staring. He must be really angry. He might go to Mr. Paine, or even the Ambassador. And Bayard, not helping out, with that insolent half-smile . . .</p>
   <p>Grigson took his cigar from his mouth, looked around, and sat down gingerly.</p>
   <p>“You mean those old canvas mailbags? Diplomatic pouches, huh? The real stuff, eh? Funny, I always pictured some kind of little leather satchel with a lot of onion-skin sheets in it, all written up in code, and a feller in a trench coat. I suppose there‘s a lot of stuff in there in code, eh? By gosh, you sure get a whale of a lot of it; wonder you have time to decipher it all.” Grigson glanced at the desk top for evidences of code.</p>
   <p>“Something like that, Mr. Grigson. Now that I‘m myself again—that is, I can relax now, with the pouches safely under lock and key—</p>
   <p>“Say,” Mr. Grigson frowned. “That pile of mailbags I saw dumped downstairs in the hall; that wasn‘t the same mail bags, was it? Not a soul standing guard over them. Natives walking right past them … ”</p>
   <p>“Oh, no, Mr. Grigson. Entirely different mailbags. But Ann has told me you‘re interested in timber … ”</p>
   <p>“Well, yes, that‘s right, Jake. I‘ve got a lot of literature here … “ Grigson fumbled in an inside pocket, brought out a sheaf of Commerce Department circulars. “I‘ve been writing to those fellows there in the Bureau of Foreign Commerce; they were mighty encouraging, gave me lots of dope. I‘ve got an idea maybe there‘s a little money to be made out here in some of the Asian lands in timber.” Grigson spread the folders on Jakes‘ desk. “Now, what I had in mind, I‘d like to see just what they‘ve got here in Samoy in the way of timber stands, logging operations, mills. Travel around the country a bit, get with the local lumbermen. Now, I wouldn‘t mind putting a little cash in a good hardheaded operation here, maybe take out my share in rough timber.”</p>
   <p>Jakes nodded, fingertips together. “An extremely sound approach, Mr. Grigson.”</p>
   <p>“Now, what I had in mind you fellers here might be able to do for me, was to put me in touch with the local business fraternity.”</p>
   <p>“Business fraternity; Mmmm … “ There was Abdul Singh, but of course, he was a minerals man, or something of the sort. And Mong Boo; he had the import-export thing he was pushing, but of course without import or export licenses . . . and anyway, he had already clipped . . . that is, secured American private capital. Bayard was always running around; perhaps he knew someone . . .</p>
   <p>“Let me consider the matter, Mr. Grigson. I‘d want to place you in contact with only business people of the highest calibre.”</p>
   <p>“You think there‘s commercial possibilities in the scheme, eh, Jake?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, indeed, yes. There‘s a real need for good wood in the States. Why only last year, while I was serving at Washington, I wanted to put a few shelves in my bedr—study, and the cost …</p>
   <p>“Say, don‘t get me wrong, Jake. I‘m not starting out to undercut U.S. lumbermen. Anyway, the Samoyan timbers are all hardwoods, fancy furniture woods, pianos and that kind of item.”</p>
   <p>“Surely; I merely meant . . . ah … ”</p>
   <p>“Now the big question is, will these fellows do business in a reasonable way? I mean with low labor costs, plenty of virgin timber, I figure they can extract a log at a fraction of what it would cost in the U.S. Now, if I could buy into the milling end, set up a high-speed conversion operation . . . why, we‘d be loading and shipping into southern ports at half what regular northern hardwoods cost.”</p>
   <p>“Mr. Grigson, let me take you down to our Commercial Library and introduce you to our Mr. Nabi. He can fill you in on the local picture, while I give some thought to ah . . .</p>
   <p>“Well, swell, Jake.” Grigson rose, beaming now.</p>
   <p>Jakes looked pointedly at Bayard. “Or, possibly Brion, you might just show Mr. Grigson down.”</p>
   <p>Jakes let the smile drop as Grigson moved out into the hall at Bayard‘s side. Why didn‘t these infernal tourists stay at home? Coming in here, chattering in trade jargon, taking him away from his substantive work . . . And now he would have to ferret out someone who could tell him something about the timber business.</p>
   <subtitle>4</subtitle>
   <p>. . . after listening to Jakes hand Grigson the line about the big business fraternity, we went down the hall to the elevator, and I pushed the button, and turned to face him.</p>
   <p>“Grigson,” I said, “This isn‘t the place for American investment. Nobody has made any money in Samoy since Independence.”</p>
   <p>Grigson took his cigar out of his mouth and frowned at me. “How‘s that?”</p>
   <p>“The only people who‘ll talk business with you are clip artists. Honest businessmen know there‘s nothing doing now. Too many government regulations.”</p>
   <p>“You mean to tell me after I‘ve come all the way out here—with all this information I have from the Foreign Commerce people in Washington— Grigson replaced the cigar, pushed the button for himself, and stared at me.</p>
   <p>“What‘s your angle, brother?” he snorted.</p>
   <p>“I‘ve sat there and listened,” I said, “while Jakes let a couple of other American businessmen in on a lot of grief. I thought I‘d try to save you some.”</p>
   <p>“Is that so?” Judging from the look Grigson gave me, he wouldn‘t have put any money on it.</p>
   <p>“You won‘t find anything in the Commercial Library, either,” I said. “Nabi is a sort of walking—or rather sitting—file of newspaper clippings. All hes been doing for thirty-five years is cutting out items after the Economic Officers mark them. After he clips them, we re-write them as dispatches; thats what they call Economic Reporting. He wont be able to tell you anything.</p>
   <p>“By God,” Grigson said. “That‘s a funny way for a U.S. Embassy man to talk. What are you, some kind of radical or something?”</p>
   <p>“It‘s your money, Grigson,” I said. “I hate to see you lose it here.” It was my turn, so I pushed the button this time.</p>
   <p>“Well, mister,” Grigson said, “I‘ve been in business a good many years, and I think I know how to take care of myself.”</p>
   <p>I passed that one. The elevator arrived and we got in and left the conversation back in the hall while we rode down to the library.</p>
   <subtitle>5</subtitle>
   <p>That socialist feller had been right about one thing, Grigson reflected. That old native downstairs hadn‘t been able to tell him a thing. No point wasting any more time down there. Good chance to get in to see the Consul, try to get his visas straightened out and find out what he could do about his boat ticket from Colombo that he hadn‘t used. Not his fault he missed the boat; train sixteen hours late, big tie-up. Brother! These Asian countries!</p>
   <p>The little native gal was coming out of the office now, giving him a nice smile. Cute . . .</p>
   <p>“The Consul will see you now, sir.”</p>
   <p>Grigson winked at her as he got to his feet. Americans, he thought. Democratic people . . .</p>
   <p>“Good morning, Mr. Uhhh— Grigson glanced at the name-plate on the desk. Mr. Feckel.</p>
   <p>The consul nodded toward a chair. “FecKEL. Accent on the last syllable.” The Consul was sitting with his hands folded over his stomach, slumped down in his chair between a big U.S. flag and another one, a dark blue one. Not too friendly looking, with those little eyes in there behind those thick specs.</p>
   <p>“What was it you wished?”</p>
   <p>Grigson crossed his legs, getting comfortable. By God, he was getting a little tired of these surly fellers. He was an American citizen; he paid their salaries; least they could do was make a man feel at home.</p>
   <p>“Well, Mr. Feckel,” (he‘d say the name any way he felt like), “I‘m out here on a business trip, looking over the timber situation . . . or anyway, I thought I was … “ Grigson paused, gave a laugh which didn‘t work out, shifted to a cough. Feckel said nothing, just looked at him.</p>
   <p>“I mean, I ran into some kind of radical upstairs; told me I‘d get swindled out here.”</p>
   <p>“What‘s this?” Feckel frowned.</p>
   <p>“Yeah. Feller from right up there in the Commercial Department. Name of Bayard. Said all the local businessmen were a bunch of confidence men. Said the government here was crooked. Said he was warning everybody off.”</p>
   <p>“Well, now, that‘s a little unusual, Mr. ah . . . Grigson.”</p>
   <p>That‘s perking him up a little, Grigson noted with satisfaction. He‘s interested in that, OK . . .</p>
   <p>“Yes, sir, told me I‘d better keep hands off. Said the business library downstairs was no good either; said the natives down there just sat around. Said the Commercial officers just read newspapers all day, faked up their reports. Said … ”</p>
   <subtitle>6</subtitle>
   <p>Barney Feckel resumed his seat after ushering Grigson out with reassurances, and laid his fingers out on the polished desk top. Hmmm. Lot of points to consider here. Let‘s start by getting all our ducks in line. We‘ll have to move quickly on this, before it‘s old stuff . . .</p>
   <p>Let‘s see, what was it about Bayard and Tom Hurd? Oh, yes, fishing for any items on the fellow; building one of his files. What‘s Hurd got in his file on us? Not much. We cover ourselves pretty well. Hadn‘t given Hurd anything, of course, What for? Information is power; never give it away. But then, never let it wither on the vine, eh? Better pass this along to Hurd before someone else gets there.</p>
   <p>Then? Surely we can get more mileage than that out of it. What about Kerrigan? Let him have it? No, Kerrigan was a foot-dragger. Too senior to tackle, too. Jakes, maybe. Oh, yes, a man could work with Jakes. This would be rich. Better get Jakes down here, so we can see the look on his face.</p>
   <p>Feckel picked up the phone, gave the number.</p>
   <p>“Say, Ben. Funny thing just happened. Want to drop down a minute . . . ?”</p>
   <subtitle>7</subtitle>
   <p>Say another hundred paces, old boy. Surely, you can do that. Yes, but that was what you said last time. Just another hundred paces, bring you right round that next turn. Border station sitting right here, maybe. Feel pretty silly sitting here, with the border just another hundred paces along. May as well try it. One. Two. Three. See? Not so bad . . .</p>
   <p>That‘s all right, get up and take another shot at it. Just forget the feet. Somebody else‘s feet. Devilish dirty trick to play on somebody else, wearing out his feet. Must remember to return them in good condition. Doing fine, now. Moving right along. Forgot to count. About ten? Call it ten. Eleven. Twelve.</p>
   <p>Turn straightening out. Long straightaway ahead. Thought you said border station . . . right around bend. Not fair. Walked around bend, no station. Just more tracks, more jungle, plenty of flies. Patience, flies. Pretty soon now, and it‘s all yours. No way to talk. Truth. Nonsense, Station right ahead. Tracks run along and there it is. Little white hut. Mirage. No. Brown man coming out of little white hut. Not lying; really made it. Made it, Sis. Made it. Made it . . .</p>
   <subtitle>8</subtitle>
   <p>Paine and the Ambassador had been unduly agitated, Fred Chalmers reflected, strolling along the Embassy corridor from the Chancery. Very well, so the Representatives had been excited. But need the Embassy throw up its hands, abandon its position? The Police Equipment agreement had been carefully thought through, and was fully justifiable. The Department had given full approval, and if the Members of Congress wished to enter hasty judgments—very well. He himself refused to join the general mood of catastrophe. In an earlier day when only gentlemen of means were called to diplomatic duty, the conduct of affairs of moment to the nation was not subject to influence by pusillanimous consideration of job tenure and advancement such as governed Paine and MacWaithe as well. It was fortunate indeed that a public servant of the old school was present on the scene. Let Alpin storm. Fred Chalmers would meet his windy talk of Congressional investigation with firmness and facts. U.S. interests demanded the stability of the present regime for at least another year. This equipment would stiffen its wavering influence, give pause to opposition factions. And though Winjee prated of martial exploits, economic considerations would govern, as always. The moneyed interests in Samoy would never permit such heroics; not until the balance of factors had shifted.</p>
   <p>So much for the tempest in a teapot which had interrupted an excellent breakfast. It might be as well, now that he was here, to have a word with Sutton as to the arrangements for the party next week at the Kogu Swimming Club.</p>
   <p>Chalmers turned into the Administrative wing, and saw Tom Hurd coming along, coatless, shirtsleeves secured by purple elastic hands . . . a vulgar figure . . . .</p>
   <p>“Well, Mr. Chalmers,” Hurd hailed him, showing yellow teeth. “We don‘t see much of you down here in Admin. Say— Hurd glanced down the hall. I was just going down to see Barney, but if youll step in my office here a minute, Mr.</p>
   <p>Chalmers, I‘ll show you what I got worked up on this Bayard . . . .”</p>
   <p>Hurd pushed the door wide, man-handled chairs into position, offered cheap cigars, adjusted his trousers so as not to bag the knees when he sat, and leaned back, beaming.</p>
   <p>“Yes, sir, Mr. Chalmers,” Tom chuckled. “Don‘t think I‘ve let that slip my mind; I got the goods on this boy. When the Inspectors get here—</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Fred interrupted, clearing his throat. “I‘m sure you‘ve handled the matter with commendable efficiency; however—</p>
   <p>“I got a real nice file on this case, Mr. Chalmers; don‘t worry; we got him where the hair is short. I been with Bert on it regular, and I been doing a lot of digging. He‘s hung hisself—</p>
   <p>“Please, Mr. Hurd. I meant to mention it to you; I . . . ah . . . wish the matter dropped. That affair . . . I was at fault. I was not myself. I would be most unhappy to see any action taken against the gentleman on my account.”</p>
   <p>Tom‘s chair came down on all four legs with a thump. “Look, Mr. Chalmers, I got this character wrapped up and ready to go. After he slugged you, I mean a high ranking—</p>
   <p>“Please, Mr. Hurd. As I explained, I was the offending party. I was entirely in the wrong. I shall take a very dim view of any use of my name in any action you may be contemplating. As a matter of fact, if called upon, I shall stand ready to offer Mr. Bayard a character reference.” Fred Chalmers stood, looked pointedly at Tom Hurd.</p>
   <p>“Good day, Mr. Hurd.”</p>
   <p>Tom sat watching as the door closed, continued to stare at the dusty glass panel. Something was going on here, and it didn‘t add up. The Bayard case had just blown up in his face. Damn good thing nothing had gone in on it yet, except Sutton‘s special E. R. Boy, what a roasting that was! And strictly Bert‘s work; Tom Hurd was still smelling like a rose.</p>
   <p>Still, Chalmers wasn‘t the only angle on the thing. Chalmers was a big shot, but Bert was still Admin Officer. Chalmers was the one that got the file going, sure, but Tom had gone on from there to build it; hell, he got dope from all over the place; plenty of locals that had a gripe to register, like those deadbeats down in the Commercial Library. Bayard had been horsing around down there, trying to get some work out of those dummies, when any dope could tell that was hopeless; old Nabi had been goofing off on that detail for thirty years, since way back when the outfit was only a Consulate. Naturally, they were ready to cry as soon as the Personnel Officer gave them a hint. Likewise with a couple of the secretaries; they were used to bitching about the workload and throwing their weight around—they knew these Econ Section types were too scared of rocking the boat to do anything—and Bayard made the mistake of calling their bluff. He must of figured he was still in the army.</p>
   <p>Sure, he could throw out the Chalmers stuff, and still have a nice file; just like Bert wanted. All he had to do was channel his stuff to Bert; just copies, of course—no signed stuff—and then sit tight and see which way the wind blew. If Bert came through OK, swell; Tom was his boy. But if Bert pulled any more of that dumb stuff, like getting Mabel to crying—or if somebody was out to get him, and he wound up on the inspectors list himself—Tom was in the clear. With Chalmers backing down, it looked like maybe Sutton was in some kind of hot water, but you never could tell. In the meantime, a little memo for the record . . .</p>
   <subtitle>9</subtitle>
   <p>Decent chaps, Lars Lund thought. Gave him a nice glass of cold water—well, anyway, water. Gave him rags, helped him clean up the face. Pretty nasty sight, that. What the hell had those bastards hit him with? Glad Sis couldnt see him now. Have to get a doctor to stitch him up right away.</p>
   <p>The border guards—two of them, with yellowish khaki jackets and shorts, and big shoulder boards—were still jabbering away. One of them was cranking the telephone again. Too bad they didnt speak English. Would have liked to offer them a cigarette, but the cops—or whatever they were—had taken them, and his wristwatch, lighter, everything in his pockets. The American currency was still safe though, under the zipper sewed to the inside of his waistband. A good joke on the cops.</p>
   <p>Wonder why these chaps wouldn‘t let him just go along to the Thai border station? Just a few meters away across the border. His two chaps had gone over and talked to their opposite numbers, but wouldn‘t let him follow. Kind but firm; made him stay there in the hut. Damned bore; feel a lot better to be across that line. Feel good to lie down, too, have a little food. Head hurts pretty bad. Maybe a damn fool to come right up to these chaps, big hello, old pals reunited and all that. Could have just slipped into the underbrush and nipped around, come up over there. Seemed a damned nuisance at the time. Sure feel sick. What next?</p>

   <p>“From where? Bangkok? Can‘t hear you— Consul Barney Feckel covered the phone. Delia! Quiet out there! This is long distance, Bangkok calling!</p>
   <p>Feckel tilted his head, hand over his right ear. “Yes, go ahead. Who? Oh, Hummel. Feckel here. FecKEL. Yes. What? Relaying from where? What border? Oh.</p>
   <p>“An American? Oh, a Swede, Well, what—Oh. Yes, yes, thats right. Never had anything come up before, though. Who? Spell that. L. U. N. D. Yes, Ive got it. Say . . . Yes, I do. Papers are full of it. At the border, eh? On what? On foot. Well. If I what? Well, certainly. That is, why …</p>
   <p>Nice kettle of fish. Why involve us in it? Damned Swede, not even an American national. Sounded fine, handling Swedish affairs, but . . . Why don‘t they maintain their own Consulate out here? Pushing the responsibility off on us. What‘s the answer? Send him back? Let him pass? Better check upstairs. But no;<emphasis> we‘re</emphasis> U.S. Consul here; our decision. Damned high-and-mighty Diplomatic Service types. Not really Diplomatic Service anymore, bunch of Civil Service outsiders, damned Wriston program. U.S. Consular Service opened up to them, too; used to be Something to be U.S. Consul, back when we came in. Did all the real work, fancy Diplomatic Service drones—</p>
   <p>Have to answer; let him by? Less trouble that way. Wash our hands of the matter. Still, might look bad. Fugitive from the law. Can‘t be accused of aiding in escape. Why did they have to call us? Should have sent him on to Bangkok, let them worry. Yes, tell them to send him on. Not our affair. Why get involved? Nothing they could do. But might be in line for criticism. Might look bad . . . Can‘t take the chance.</p>
   <p>“Hello? Thought for a minute the connection was gone. Yes, of course. Perhaps you‘d better send him back. That‘s right. I‘ll notify the police authorities. What time—What? About eight P.M.? Very well. Whats that? Well, now! This man is a fugitive. Thats right. Of course Im sure! Im not in the habit—Eh? Well, it was you who called me. Didnt expect what? Well, to us its far from routine. We have a responsibility to discharge. Well be expecting him on the evening train.</p>
   <p>Barney Feckel slammed the receiver down. Just a routine check, eh? Just a routine passing of the buck! Just wanted to clear it, did they? Didn‘t think we‘d send him back to a Samoyan jail, didn‘t they? Well, next time they‘d know better than to expect the U.S. Consul at Samoy to shirk his job. Not like these namby pamby newcomers. Sure, Samoy jail was a little primitive, but he should have thought about that when he was robbing the till. Damned fool to get caught. Should have by-passed the border station. Hate to have to walk out ourselves . . .</p>
   <p>Might be a good idea to report to Paine right away. Give him our side. We‘re in the right, of course, but you never can tell. Easier to let him go. But safer this way . . . . Anyway, better call Paine.</p>
   <subtitle>11</subtitle>
   <p>In his office in the chancery wing, Bradley Paine frowned at the door. Why, he wondered, was the Chief Inspector of Police insisting on seeing him, rather than the Administrative or Consular Officer? More trouble, no doubt. Nothing had gone right since yesterday, when that damned fool Winjee blundered in and set off the explosion. Thank God for Fred Chalmers! One had to admire the way he stood up to Alpin, in defense of Embassy Policy. It was easier for Fred, of course, not being a career man—having independent means to fall back on. He could afford to challenge them . . . .</p>
   <p>The Ambassador was furious, of course, and naturally held Bradley Paine fully responsible. It was impossible to reason with the man. Ironic that on the eve of retirement, for the first time a major fiasco was laid at his doorstep. And in the midst of the upheaval, Bert Sutton had felt impelled to bring up his petty grievances for discussion. Of course, he felt no resentment against Sutton over Marie. Bert had actually done him a favor. But the man was a fool to force notice of friction with his subordinates. Sutton had gone about as far as he could hope in the Service. There was no promotion in store for an officer who so far lacked sagacity as to display such lack of discretion in his affair with a junior officer‘s wife . . . .</p>
   <p>And Bayard; quite apparently a misfit in the Service. No doubt Sutton had exaggerated whatever it was Bayard had said to him, but he would not have completely fabricated the incident. He himself had been far too lenient with Bayard in the Chalmers affair. Those asinine ideas of chivalry—grossly misapplied to the Cummins girl—could hardly be allowed to interfere with the proper conduct of Embassy business. Suppose Fred Chalmers had taken umbrage, resigned in a fit of anger; yesterday would have been far worse had Fred not been at hand. Sutton had been right in that: there would be no more coddling of insubordination. Now the man Bayard, emboldened by his earlier impunity, had apparently threatened his superior with some sort of blackmail. Well, the inspectors would be along in a few days. The matter would be referred to them, and the source of dissention eliminated.</p>
   <p>There was a discreet buzz from the interoffice phone. Well, this would be the police . . . .</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>“—among the items found in his possession were: an automatic pistol, for which permit number 4892 was issued on December 19 last to Mr. B. Bayard of your Embassy … “ The Police Inspector looked at Paine expectantly, Paine returned the look with practiced calm.</p>
   <p>“I see.” Now what the devil was Bayard involved in? The man surely hadn‘t taken part in the remittance scheme? Or had he? That girl; wasn‘t she the sister—</p>
   <p>“In addition, the sum of two hundred twenty-four dollars in American notes was found secreted in the lining of his trousers.”</p>
   <p>“Of course,” Paine said, “the notes might have been procured from any of a number of sources outside the Embassy. As to the gun, I shall certainly inquire of Mr. Bayard as to whether he was aware of its loss—</p>
   <p>“Of course. But as to Mr. Bayard, we are most curious as to his role in the matter—</p>
   <p>“His role? Well, I hardly feel that—</p>
   <p>“A moment, Mr. Paine. I have not yet mentioned another item of information regarding Mr. Bayard. The residence of Mr. Lund was placed under police surveillance as soon as it was reported that the gentleman had absconded. At about one in the morning—todays date—Mr. Bayard was seen to enter the house in company with a young woman, the sister of Mr. Lund. He remained in the house until the hour of six this morning, when he emerged and came direct to the Embassy.</p>
   <p>Paine felt his face stiffening, in spite of his effort to retain a bland look of mild interest. The fool! And that lovely girl; another slut! They were all the same: treacherous creatures. And Bayard, up to his idiotic neck in a stupid piece of chicanery . . .</p>
   <p>“Of course,” the Inspector was saying, “Mr. Bayard enjoys diplomatic immunity from arrest, but it had occurred to me that under the circumstances the Embassy would wish to extend to the police the privilege of having a little chat with him, quite informally, of course. Merely to assist us in concluding this unfortunate business as promptly as possible, you understand.” The Inspector was smiling pleasantly. Paine forced a stiff smile. The police would love to get their hands on an American Embassy Officer, wouldn‘t they? Then, by clever questioning, force admissions, implicate others . . .</p>
   <p>“Well, Inspector, I shall of course query Mr. Bayard at length to discover whatever he may know of the matter through his—ah—acquaintance with the young lady …</p>
   <p>“Possibly, Mr. Paine, a short interview at my office—</p>
   <p>“I‘m sorry.” Paine allowed his expression to stiffen a bit more. This chap knew better than that. Did he actually expect an opportunity to third-degree an American diplomat?</p>
   <p>“Naturally, I wish to avoid embarrassment all around, Mr. Paine. How unfortunate if the newspapers should get an idea in their heads—you know how these journalistic fellows are—ha ha—they could make it appear the U.S. Embassy was sheltering criminals—</p>
   <p>“Really, Inspector—</p>
   <p>“I myself understand, of course; however, it would be so simple if Mr. Bayard would merely call—at his own convenience, any time during the afternoon—and we could all have a friendly little chat.</p>
   <p>“I really cannot waive diplomatic immunity so casually, Inspector—</p>
   <p>“Oh, there will be no question of waiving of immunity. Merely a little helpful talk.”</p>
   <p>“I shall be glad to pass along anything of interest which Mr. Bayard may mention, Inspector—</p>
   <p>“Or even a few minutes with Mr. Bayard here in your office—</p>
   <p>“Really, Inspector—</p>
   <p>“How tedious, Mr. Paine, and how unnecessarily suggestive of secretiveness on the part of the Embassy. If I should be forced to take the matter up with the Foreign Minister and formally request waiver of immunity, the publicity—</p>
   <p>“I can assure you, Inspector, the Embassy will not yield on this point. Your department will be saved a great deal of embarrassment by accepting my assurances—</p>
   <p>The Inspector rose, smiling tightly. “As you wish, Mr. Paine. Of course I shall not insist.”</p>
   <p>Bradley Paine came around the desk, warm smile in place. “Rest assured I‘ll advise you fully of whatever Mr. Bayard may have learned of the affair, which I am sure will be very little. Have you questioned the fellow Lund?”</p>
   <p>The Inspector glanced at Paine in surprise. “He will not arrive in the city until eight o‘clock this evening. He is being returned from the Thai border, as you know.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, yes. And you say he had made his way there on foot.”</p>
   <p>“On foot, yes. One must sympathize with the poor chap. A difficult walk. It was most helpful of the Embassy to request his return.”</p>
   <p>Paine blinked and cleared his throat to cover the blank look. The Embassy ordered his return? Was this another of the Inspector‘s gambits? Who—</p>
   <p>“Good day, Mr. Paine. If you should change your mind—</p>
   <subtitle>12</subtitle>
   <p>“Now, Mr. Paine, that‘s a little bit unfair. We tried to call, but you were tied up. I mean to say, after all, as Consular Officer, we—</p>
   <p>“Look here, Feckel! You‘re not Principle Officer at some out-of-the way post, now. You‘re on an Embassy staff! Of all the presumptuous imbecility it‘s ever been my misfortune to encounter, this is surely—</p>
   <p>“The man‘s a criminal, Mr. Paine! Were we supposed to let him get clean away—</p>
   <p>“The man had not, to your certain knowledge, even had a complaint officially lodged against him—</p>
   <p>“But the papers—</p>
   <p>“The papers are hardly official documents! You had merely to express indifference, and he would have slipped quietly out of our view. You lacked the wit to see that. Now we‘ll be fortunate if we can keep the entire mission from being dragged into the newspapers as accessories to the crime. Already the police have been here demanding the right to question certain individuals.”</p>
   <p>“Question the staff? Why, diplomatic im—”</p>
   <p>“Diplomatic immunity! The equivalent of the Fifth Amendment! Because of you we‘re forced to hide behind a technicality to avoid involvement in a sordid scandal! Your doing, sir! But rest assured we‘ll waive nothing. It will look unsavory in the extreme, but not so unsavory as an Embassy Officer in the Samoy prison.”</p>
   <p>Feckel looked shaken as he left the office. Paine sat glaring after him. Utter damned fool! Incompetent ass! As if there were not enough trouble brewing, this! What a field day the Honorable Members of the House would have with this! Hiding behind immunity to avoid criminal prosecution! Bayard deserved to be thrown to the dogs, the scoundrel. Coming into an Embassy of the United States, stirring up trouble, manhandling senior officers, with his maudlin pretense of gallantry—perhaps he had enjoyed intimacies with Marie himself; that could account for his interest—and meanwhile openly cohabiting with the sister of a common thief, and doubtless playing his part in the black market. Well, other considerations prevented allowing the law to take its course here, but he would personally do everything in his power to see the man behind bars after he was cashiered.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, the Ambassador would have to be informed of the latest developments, and of course Bradley Paine would have the honor of informing him. Paine stood and smoothed down his lapels, brushed a hand over his temple; might as well get on with it . . . .</p>

   <p>Sitting in his study, Ambassador MacWaithe frowned at the telegraphic despatch. The Department was behaving oddly in this matter. He had made an excellent presentation of the situation in his report, yet now, after a week with no response whatever, a classified, encrypted instruction arrives at night, completely disregarding his recommendations. Alpin‘s meddling, very likely . . . . Diverting the Inspectors here to his post ahead of schedule, implying that he was unable to control the situation. It was unpleasant, this uneasy feeling. But it was ridiculous, of course. He was no longer a struggling Economic Officer, fearing every glance from a superior; he was Arlington Fitch MacWaithe, Career Minister, Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to the Republic of Samoy, the personal representative of the President. This fellow Tate; a mere FSO-2, an integratee . . . There was nothing at which to be alarmed. The affair had been handled quite properly. Distinctly unfortunate, this Bayard person having been assigned to his staff, but he was hardly responsible for that. The man was apparently a complete anarchist. However, that was the work of the Board of Examiners; let them explain it.</p>
   <p>As for the matter of diplomatic immunity, that was to be taken out of his hands, it seemed. His instructions were to permit the Inspectors ample opportunity to observe the man at close hand, and to take Tate‘s recommendations under careful advisement. Departmentalese for “do as Tate instructs”. Something of an affront, but still, the responsibility . . . . Let the man have it. Diplomatic immunity was not a principle to abrogate lightly; he would be content to let another bear the onus.</p>
   <subtitle>2</subtitle>
   <p>Foreign Service Inspector Tate waited until the boy—a wizened old blackfella wearing a dirty green-and-white uniform—had finished switching on lamps, fiddling with the air conditioner, and twitching towels about in the bathroom, and was moving to the door. Then he flipped the fifty po coin toward him. If he missed, let him scramble for it. He wouldnt give the damned parasite a cent, but then theyd take it out on him in lousy service and insolence. The boy reached out a skinny arm and caught the coin, flashing a grin, then slipped through the door.</p>
   <p>Tate glanced around the room, loosening his belt to ease his paunch. Shabby, hard bed, worn rug, noisy air conditioner; was this the best lodgings in Samoy? Not likely; the Embassy could have done better. Not very smart, were they? He took the notebook from his vest pocket, picked a mechanical pencil lettered “souvenir of Parisian Grille, Hong Kong” from among the selection clipped to a breast pocket, and made a note. Whoever was responsible would soon find out it wasn‘t smart to play games with L. P. Tate, FSO-2, Foreign Service Inspector. Oh, he could laugh it off personally, of course. He was used to hardship; sure, and the persecution, too, that a man ran into when he did a job, played no favorites. Nothing personal in it; but it showed the attitude of the post. They were already in plenty of hot water; looks like they‘d make a little special effort instead . . . .</p>
   <p>They‘d wonder how he saw through them so quick—they always did. After they tried to butter him up with bribes—like the bottle of Red Label (not even Black Label—not very smart, were they?) and the carton of cigarettes on the table. Did they think they could buy off L. P. Tate that cheap? HAH!</p>
   <p>Tate tucked the notebook away, pulled off his coat, and stepped to the looming teak wardrobe. Doors should have been open, airing. Last one in here was probably some kind of Indian—</p>
   <p>Tate stared at the three wire coat hangers on the bar. He glanced at the empty shelf above. Deliberately, he allowed the coat to fall to the floor. His features twitched to a rigid smile. So. This is how it was, eh? He, L. P. Tate, FSO-2, Foreign Service Inspector, had taken the time (he knew not even these basic needs would be anticipated, but would have to be patiently pointed out) had taken the time to wire ahead; not once, but twice, mind you; with the simple request for an ample supply of coat hangers and brown paper. Had the hangers and the brown paper been placed in the room? No. No, they had not. He, L. P. Tate, had the foresight to make this simple request, well in advance—twice, mind you—and the result? Nothing. His wishes were ignored. Openly, blatantly ignored.</p>
   <p>Tate picked up the telephone, eyes slitted. “Connect me with Mr. Taylor‘s room.” He waited while the instrument clicked and buzzed, then Taylor answered.</p>
   <p>“Chester—come up here. Tate cradled the phone, hooked thumbs in his vest, and paced off the length of the room, turned, back to the door, turned . . .</p>
   <p>There was a knock; Tate called out, eyed Taylor coldly as he came in quietly, easing the door shut behind him.</p>
   <p>“Chester—</p>
   <p>“Yes sir, L. P.”</p>
   <p>“I seem to recall, Chester, a conversation between you and myself at Karachi. I think a telegram was mentioned, which I wished to insure there‘d be a few coat hangers and a scrap or two of brown paper on hand here.”</p>
   <p>“Sure, L.P., I sent the wire off right off from the hotel—</p>
   <p>“Just a minute, Chester,” Tate raised a hand. “It seems to me I recall that at Bangkok I mentioned the matter again, which you were a little unsure as to whether you had taken time to do as I asked you, and at that time I was under the impression I again said a word about sending a telegram.”</p>
   <p>“I sure sent it off, L. P.—</p>
   <p>“Did you, Chester?” Tate smiled sadly. “Take a look in the closet there, Chester. Maybe your eyesight is a little better than mine.”</p>
   <p>Taylor went to the closet, hesitating as he noticed the coat on the floor, stooped and picked it up.</p>
   <p>“Do you see brown paper there, Chester? Do you see it anywhere in the room? Do you see coat hangers, Chester?”</p>
   <p>“Well, L. P., just the three—</p>
   <p>Chester knew better than that; he knew those three didn‘t count. Chester was trying his wings. Not very smart, was he? Chester needed ‘slapping down hard every so often, or he began to get ideas.</p>
   <p>“I have the copy right there in my room. L. P. The slippage must be here at this end—</p>
   <p>“Copies, Chester? Have I said anything about copies? I‘m talking about coat hangers and brown paper, Chester. Let‘s leave your room out of it until later. We can chat about the contents of your room another time. Suppose we keep to the subject now, if you don‘t have any serious objections?”</p>
   <p>“I‘ll call, L. P., and have them send up some—</p>
   <p>“No time now for playing with the telephone, Chester! Did I say anything about playing with the telephone? Time for that later, Chester. At the moment it‘s a little bit awkward for me having to stand around holding my coat because there‘s no place to put it. Hang it on the floor; that your idea, Chester?”</p>
   <p>“No, sir, I—</p>
   <p>“But it‘s all right, Chester. I‘m getting used to it by now. After a hard day, instead of a little relaxation, a friendly chat here with my associate,” (he could have called him a subordinate, but did Chester appreciate the compliment? Oh, no; just let it pass). “Instead of that, Chester, inconvenience, little chores to attend to. As for your attitude, Chester, I‘m all in favor of a junior speaking right out, saying what‘s on his mind. But these wisecracks—But never mind, Chester. As I said, Im used to it.</p>
   <p>“L. P., I sure didn‘t mean—</p>
   <p>“I SAID NEVER MIND, CHESTER. We won‘t discuss the matter. Open that bottle of scotch; probably a glass there in the bathroom.”</p>
   <p>Tate sat down in the easy chair, pulled off his shoes, removed the socks and tucked them into the shoes, and rubbed his feet against the rug. Taylor came back with a glass, tilted the bottle over it. Watch him stop pouring now, have to be told to go ahead, pour a decent drink, trying to make it look like his chief was a pig about liquor . . . Well, still pouring; maybe he was learning; hey—</p>
   <p>“Hold on, Chester! I said a drink, not a bath!”</p>
   <p>“Sorry, L. P.”</p>
   <p>Tate grunted, swallowed half the whiskey. What was Chester standing there for? Damnation, didn‘t a man ever get a little peace?</p>
   <p>“What is it, Chester?”</p>
   <p>“Nothing, L. P.”</p>
   <p>Oh, must want a shot for himself. Envy; lousy spectacle, envy.</p>
   <p>“Have a drink, Chester.”</p>
   <p>“Uh, no thanks, L. P. Uh—</p>
   <p>Tate finished his drink, put the glass on the table.</p>
   <p>“I want to make an early start in the morning, Chester. I don‘t suppose you happened to think to tell anybody to have a car over here for me at seven.”</p>
   <p>“Cummins—thats the GSO—said hed put a car at our—at your disposal, L. P. Its out front now.</p>

   <p>Yin-Yin sat with the others in the house of old Chan Ying, listening. He, soon-to-be Marshal of the new People‘s Republic, thrust aside here with these petty mob leaders. Was he to lose face thus, while the Chinaman made childish promises to these fools? It was not to be borne . . . but the Chinaman would learn his mistake . . . .</p>
   <p>Time was growing short. Already the first of the American weapons lay in the Army depot at Thityin. The mobs were ready, the plans laid—But a premature outbreak would bring the long-awaited weapons into action against the Peoples forces. A sorry development that would be. And instead of drumming the lesson home to these fools—all eager for loot-—the Chinaman merely inflamed them the more. There was danger in this bungling . . . .</p>
   <subtitle>4</subtitle>
   <p>“I don‘t understand why you called me,” Henry Cummins said. Alice Chan twisted the flimsy handkerchief between her delicate fingers.</p>
   <p>“The evil men, Henry—they are there—at the house of my father. I fear them, Henry—they speak of death and burning and terrible things—</p>
   <p>“What‘s this got to do with me? My God, Alice, if anybody noticed me meeting you here—</p>
   <p>“It is of the whites that they speak, Henry. They talk of killing the Americans—all but the women. If the one called Little Tiger who threatens—</p>
   <p>“Killing Americans? They must be out of their minds. Where did you say they were?”</p>
   <p>“Come, Henry. I will show you . . . .”</p>
   <p>Alice Chan touched Henry‘s arm, “Here, Henry.”</p>
   <p>Cummins looked across the narrow street at the tiny door with the lantern gleaming feebly beside it.</p>
   <p>“OK, Alice,” he said. “You go back to the car. I‘ll go over and take a look around.”</p>
   <p>“Henry, no,” Alice said. “I wished merely to show you the place—</p>
   <p>“Let me handle this Alice.”</p>
   <p>“You must not go there alone, Henry. They are evil men … ”</p>
   <p>“Look, Alice, you brought me down here. If there‘s any monkey business going on, the Embassy ought to know. Now go back to the car.”</p>
   <p>“As you say, Henry.” Alice ducked her head, turned away.</p>
   <p>“I‘ll be right back.” Cummins said. He crossed the street. This was probably a wild-goose chase, but there just might be something to it. But nothing for him to worry about; just a bunch of locals . . .</p>
   <p>Henry paused at the door to pull off his shoes as Alice had cautioned, and eased the door open. It was different inside, everything tiny and ornate. Dark, too. He could hear voices, all right. These walls must be made out of paper.</p>
   <p>The voices stopped suddenly. Henry stood still, listening.</p>
   <p>A panel moved aside down the hall, weak yellow light gleaming from the room beyond. A man came out, stood staring at Henry. Voices broke out in a babble of Chinese, quickly hushed. A narrow-faced Chinese came up to him.</p>
   <p>“Who are you?” he barked.</p>
   <p>Henry forced a smile. “Cummins, Henry Cummins.” Henry put out his hand. The Chinese ignored it, turning to spit a command at the man behind him. Suddenly uneasy, Henry turned back toward the door.</p>
   <p>“Stop there!”</p>
   <p>Henry looked at the narrow face, then down at the pistol in the man‘s white-knuckled hand.</p>
   <p>“Say, look here,” he said. “I‘m an American citizen. I‘m from the American Embassy. Just get out of the way—</p>
   <p>Little Tiger rammed the gun hard into Henry‘s stomach.</p>
   <p>“Get back, white pig!”</p>
   <p>Henry yelled, stepped back, and in the same motion drove a straight right into the face before him. Jesus, that jab with the gun hurt like the devil . . . . He stumbled toward the door. Had to get out of here; must have been crazy to come here in the first place, down here in Chinatown, with a local female employee, fighting . . .</p>
   <p>Henry felt an agonizing crack on the back of his head. The floor shifted underfoot. He was down, groping. Oh, it hurt, it hurt! They were dragging at him. Going to vomit . . .</p>
   <subtitle>5</subtitle>
   <p>Future Marshal Yin-Yin half grinned at the figure groaning on the floor. He dropped the ivory figurine with which he had struck the big white man, and looked at the others.</p>
   <p>“See him moaning and puking there, grovelling. That is as it should be. A dog of a spy of the Americans.”</p>
   <p>The street door burst open and Alice Chan stood looking down at Henry, eyes wide. She screamed. Yin-Yin stepped to her, knocked her to the floor.</p>
   <p>“This traitorous bitch aids the Yankee. Take her also!” He pointed to a door. Someone was at his side, babbling . . .</p>
   <p>“My daughter. Only a foolish woman. She had nothing—</p>
   <p>“Silence, old fool!” Yin-Yin glared at Chan Ying. He had always thought this one a reluctant patriot. Now his daughter brought spies . . . He would deal with him later. Yin-Yin followed the others into the room. The white man sat now, holding his head and dabbing at the blood on his face. How much did he know? No matter, he would tell; yes, he would confide in Yin-Yin.</p>
   <subtitle>6</subtitle>
   <p>Bert Sutton rose as Marie crossed the lantern-hung terrace. He drew out her chair, smiling.</p>
   <p>“Marie, it‘s almost ten; I was beginning to worry that you might not come— He gave a chuckle to show how silly <emphasis>that</emphasis> idea was.</p>
   <p>“Oh, Bert; you know I wouldn‘t stand you up. It‘s just that it‘s so hard to get out. Henry‘s so—well, sort of suspicious . . . .</p>
   <p>“My God, Marie, you haven‘t let him get any ideas—</p>
   <p>“Oh, no, Bert. Henry doesn‘t dream … ”</p>
   <p>“I mean, after all, it‘s better if we‘re discreet about the thing, even if we do have every right—</p>
   <p>“Certainly, Bert. I understand. It‘s really awfully noble of you to want to sort of spare Henry‘s feelings.”</p>
   <p>Bert smiled, a noble smile. “Yes, Marie, we have to be thoughtful. When two people are as crazy about each other as we are they tend to get a little selfish, but—</p>
   <p>“I knew you‘d feel that way, Bert. I knew you‘d understand when I told you—</p>
   <p>“Told me what?” Bert was frowning. Was this going to be another stall? What was she trying to pull? Was he supposed to wait forever?</p>
   <p>Bert swallowed. “What is it I‘m supposed to understand … ”</p>
   <p>“It‘s Henry. He has these moods. Sometimes he‘s so blue. Like right now. He‘s so worried about the inspectors coming. I just wish I could tell him how you‘re going to help him, Bert. It would make him feel so much better. He just sits around. Right now he‘s lying down. He doesn‘t know I‘m out of the house. So I‘ll have to run, in just a minute—</p>
   <p>“Run! But Marie, I was thinking that tonight . . . Look, Ruth is away, there‘s nobody at my place. Let‘s go over there where we can be alone.” Bert reached for Marie‘s hand. “You just don‘t know, Marie, how nuts I am about you.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, I do, Bert.”</p>
   <p>“Then why the hell are we always standing around talking about getting together instead of getting a little action?”</p>
   <p>Marie stared at Bert, wide-eyed. Her lip trembled. Bert looked at her aghast.</p>
   <p>“My God, Marie, I‘m sorry; I mean, I didn‘t mean, I mean … ”</p>
   <p>Marie smiled through the incipient tears.</p>
   <p>“I mean it‘s just that you‘re so damned desirable. But I can wait. I mean when two people are as crazy about each other—</p>
   <p>“You‘re so understanding.”</p>
   <p>“But maybe if we just dashed over for a quickie—</p>
   <p>“Bert!” Marie looked stricken.</p>
   <p>“I‘m sorry, Marie. What I meant was … ”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Marie was gone. Bert stared glumly at his glass. He needed another drink. Damned fool, paying five kots a shot in a place like this with commissary prices what they were, but to hell with it! He beckoned to a waiter.</p>
   <p>“Whiskey on the rocks.” Bert made gestures symbolizing whiskey on the rocks. “Ice.”</p>
   <p>This was getting frustrating as hell. How long was it now, two weeks, since he and Marie had found out how crazy they were about each other. And she was still staying at arm‘s length. Of course, she had a real problem there, with a neurotic like Henry for a husband, but there ought to be something . . .</p>
   <p>Bert thought about Marie. What a figure she had. He leered into his glass, thinking of Marie‘s figure. Wasn‘t he ever going to get any closer . . .</p>
   <p>Bert blinked suddenly, looking at the highlights on an ice-cube. Maybe—why hadnt it occurred to him before? Sure, that was it. Marriage! That was what was bothering Marie, subconsciously, of course. She thought this would just be a short-time fling, and then hed go on to something else, and shed be left with Henry. Couldnt you just see what it would be for her to have to face the idea of a lifetime with Henry, after having known a real dynamic personality like Bert Sutton? No wonder she was skittish. Poor kid!</p>
   <p>Well, what about it? Why not? A man could be proud of a young wife like Marie. Henry was no problem. Tell him what to do, and he‘d do it. Henry knew who controlled his career. Especially if Marie told him plainly she had no use for him. And as for Ruth; well, poor old Ruth would just have to take her chances. It‘s what a woman deserved when she didn‘t make the effort—just the little, minimum effort—to try to hold her husbands interest. Sure, Ruth still looked OK—she wouldnt be Mrs. Bert Sutton if she didnt have the kind of looks people would admire—but mentally—strictly a back number. As for grounds, that was easy. Ruth knew better than to try to stop him. If necessary, there were plenty of people around who owed him a favor—like Henry—who would back up anything hed say.</p>
   <p>By God, he‘d do it! A new, young wife! Why hadn‘t he thought of it before? It was a perfect match. He‘d tell Marie tomorrow night, and wouldn‘t she be tickled!</p>

   <p>Sitting alone at the bar at the Turf Club, Harry Yung How looked mournfully into his gin glass. Where was Bot Sut Ton these days? For long and long now he had been sitting each evening alone here in the club of the Europeans, feeling out of place as a joss stick in a mission school; and not even the smooth gin of the English was compensation for the loss of face to a wealthy man like Harry Yung How, that none came to drink with him. And more, each day the hard-eyed Tong-men pressed him harder, wanting more of cash and new tidings of the Embassy. It was hard, to have labored and become a man of wealth here among the monkey-people of Samoy, only to have fat taxes levied by hoodlums in the name of Mother China, and to be forced, too, to carry information, extracted by friendship and gin, from his American crony, Bot Sut Ton. And now, the American came not as of yore, and what was a simple man to do? But did the Tong-men look with patience on his explanations? No, they spoke of knives and knuckle-presses, and took his gold, and if soon now he did not bring news, it promised ill for Harry Yung How. He had been a fool ever to seek out the white foreigners, and take an English name, and cast aside the comfort of cotton slippers and skull cap for the binding trappings of the West. To this shame it had brought him . . . .</p>
   <p>Harry finished his gin and ordered another. He must forget face, ring Bot Sut Ton yet again and tomorrow, for sure, meet with him and talk of bridge and golf and ponies, and then after sufficient gin, of other matters . . . .</p>

   <p>In the back room of her father‘s house Alice knelt on the floor beside Henry, wiping the blood from his face. She had brought him to this, when she had wished only to bring him joy. His poor hands; his gentle hands. Alice wept softly. She could not bear to look. For her he had come here, and she, miserable woman, had led him to torment and death. It was well that she too should die; this shame was a thing not to be borne. And they would die together, as lovers. Was this not more than she had ever really hoped? Better this than a life of—</p>
   <p>Henry tried to speak. His eyes opened. Her poor Henry! It would have been better if he had slept on . . .</p>
   <p>“Alice . . . .” Henry‘s voice was weak. He raised his head. “Where are they?”</p>
   <p>“Never mind, my Henry. Sleep. All will be soon finished … ”</p>
   <p>Henry sat up, groped to his feet.</p>
   <p>“God! Look at my hands! Those devils … ”</p>
   <p>“No, Henry—</p>
   <p>“I‘ve got to get out … ”</p>
   <p>“Henry! You cannot!”</p>
   <p>Henry went to the tiny window, tore aside the curtains, wincing at the pain in his hands. Fingers must be broken; nails were torn . . .</p>
   <p>“It is no use, Henry!”</p>
   <p>He picked up a stool, swung it at the glass, knocking away the fragments. Dark out there. Good. Got to get away . . . . He swung a leg over the sill, groped for footing.</p>
   <p>Outside, Oon, startled by the crash of glass, stood fingering the heavy rifle. The white devil was coming! Yin-Yin said he would not stir for many hours, but it was he! He would be like a wild beast in his rage . . .</p>
   <p>Oon worked the bolt, took aim, and from a distance of ten feet, fired. Alice screamed as Henry seemed to leap back into the room, sprawling. Blood was coming, much blood, so much, and Alice was at his side, his head in her lap. Now let them shoot her, quickly! In life, never could she have had such a master as Henry, but in death he would be hers.</p>
   <p>Henry moved. He spoke, but it was too faint . . .</p>
   <p>“I am with thee, Henry.”</p>
   <p>Henry opened his eyes and looked into Alice‘s face.</p>
   <p>“Marie . . . .”</p>
   <subtitle>9</subtitle>
   <p>The Chinaman, Little Tiger, threw open the door, stared at the shambles. Idiots! This could bring ruin . . . . He whirled. “Summon Koom! And bring the pig of a mutineer who fired the gun!” Now the great elephant of a white spy would have to be carried to a place of disposal, instead of walking there. How? But let Koom solve that, or forfeit his head. And the woman; the fool. She had been meant for his own house, after the Day, but now . . .</p>
   <p>Koom appeared in the door, hulking. Little Tiger pointed to Alice. “Slay this one! Then destroy the carcasses!”</p>
   <p>Koom went to Alice. Little Tiger watched as he put the knife into her side. A skillful technician, Koom. Silent, and little blood. A pity, she was a rare flower, that one . . .</p>
   <p>“I want no traces remaining, so do thy work well, Koom.” Koom‘s brothers came in, moved about their task silently. There was much blood from the white man. Now for the fool who fired the gun; yes, and the old man, too . . .</p>
   <subtitle>10</subtitle>
   <p>Koom pulled the heavy corpse from the cart, dragged it into the interior of the bamboo hut, dumped it beside the small one.</p>
   <p>“Bring the lamp oil,” he said. The can was thrust into his hand. He poured it over the bodies, splashed it on the woven bamboo walls, then passed it back to the other.</p>
   <p>“Soak the huts on either side well; arouse no one.” He went back to stand by the cart. The others were back in five minutes, cans empty. Koom went to the back of the hut, tossed a match through a rent in the flimsy wall, then turned and slipped away into shadows.</p>
   <subtitle>11</subtitle>
   <p>The Deputy Prime Minister looked at the Minister of the Interior critically.</p>
   <p>“The fact remains,” he said, “One hundred and four thousand dollars in currency does not evaporate into thin air.”</p>
   <p>“The Indian insists he has never actually handled the cash. Of course, the man is a practiced liar, but I believe this. All moneys were paid over to the European. He—stubbornly—denies all knowledge.</p>
   <p>“There are methods of encouraging candor … ”</p>
   <p>“He is a difficult man. That is why I have troubled you tonight, Chaw. I have a suggestion to offer.”</p>
   <p>“The American?”</p>
   <p>“Not exactly, Chaw. The Embassy will not give him up; but maybe there is another way. Suppose someone of the Embassy staff were to confide in us informally.”</p>
   <p>“Very unlikely. And in any event—</p>
   <p>“Your pardon, Chaw. My Inspector of Police has made a rather thorough study of all foreign Embassy staffs in our country. He knows a good deal about each individual, their strengths and weaknesses. I have talked this matter over with him, and he agrees that we might pick up something useful, if it were possible to—ah—relax inhibitions a bit, in an atmosphere of cordiality and Scotch whiskey.</p>
   <p>“Ah.”</p>
   <p>“Quite so. Now, in considering a likely subject, the name of Mr. Sutton was brought up. He is fond of drinking, has a loose tongue, great egotism—and to top it off, entertains a bitter personal animosity toward Mr. Bayard.</p>
   <p>“So; of what value is this? You think he would be in the confidence of his enemy?”</p>
   <p>“By no means. However, he may be the recipient of useful Embassy gossip; or perhaps he has observed something. If we had just a small hint as to where to look … ”</p>
   <p>“It seems to me it would be a great deal easier to ask the European whom you have at your disposal twenty-four hours daily at Samoy gaol.”</p>
   <p>“I think he does not know, Chaw. You see, the role of the American would have been, we think, to receive the cash and smuggle it out via diplomatic pouch.”</p>
   <p>“Then the money is gone.”</p>
   <p>“Perhaps not; that amount of currency occupies a considerable volume of space; since the funds were delivered by the Ministry of Finance only two days before the affair came to light, there has not yet been time to dispose of the cash. He could manage only a small amount in any one shipment without attracting attention, and there have been only six American couriers in the past two weeks. So the bulk of the cash is still here, somewhere.”</p>
   <p>“All this could have been avoided had the payment been made by draft.”</p>
   <p>“The notes were on hand, and I think the excellent Minister of Finance feared they would mould in the vault.”</p>
   <p>“But, if the cash is secreted in the Embassy, we may as well forget it.”</p>
   <p>“But perhaps it is not. And perhaps Mr. Sutton will tell us, if we can isolate him for a time.”</p>
   <p>“Very well; there is nothing to be lost, I suppose. Now just what is the setting you have in mind in which Mr. Sutton will unburden himself?”</p>
   <p>“I believe you mentioned, Chaw, that you planned an outing on the river, a day or two of contemplation and quiet? How charming if Mr. Sutton and a few others—there are some extremely convivial men on the police staff—should go along, and together they all become very friendly and talkative.</p>
   <p>“On my boat? I have seen this Sutton. An objectionable man. Spare me his company!”</p>
   <p>“Ah, but Chaw, it is your own eminent presence which will charm Mr. Sutton into our net.”</p>
   <p>Chaw looked at the minister sourly. “Since I have nothing better to suggest, I suppose I can only agree. But I am not hopeful.”</p>
   <p>“I was sure you would approve, Chaw. I will transmit your invitation at once. You set out at three tomorrow afternoon?”</p>
   <p>“That is my plan, but I can delay if necessary.”</p>
   <p>“No need, I am sure. Mr. Sutton will not miss this opportunity to hobnob with the Deputy Prime Minister.”</p>

   <p>. . . I went into the Commercial Library and caught the tail-end of a tri-lingual conversation. A man always swears best in his own language, but Nabi‘s Hindu and Oo Sin‘s Samoyan were losing gamely to a Chinese with round shoulders, a rolled umbrella, short khaki pants, shoes without socks, and a strident voice. I made a sound coming through the swinging gate, and the sudden silence almost hurt my ears. I beckoned Tommy Dass over.</p>
   <p>“I think they‘re going to let me in to see Lund this morning, Tommy, and I need an interpreter to talk to the warden.”</p>
   <p>“Sure, sir,” Tommy said. “I got plenty experience. I am interpreter for Japanese during occupation.”</p>
   <p>“I thought that was when you were running the black market.”</p>
   <p>“Very busy those days, sir. Americans going to shoot me when they come, but I am only boy.”</p>
   <p>The Chinese chap came over, bobbing his head.</p>
   <p>“Aw, goo‘ affanoon, missa aww,” he said.</p>
   <p>“This is Mr. Hu, sir,” Tommy Dass said.</p>
   <p>I greeted Mr. Hu. “I‘m taking some cigarettes along, Tommy,” I said. “Will they let him have them?”</p>
   <p>“You wanna hire goo‘ Chinese cook?” Mr. Hu inquired.</p>
   <p>“Maybe, sir,” Tommy said. “Maybe split fifty-fifty with guards.”</p>
   <p>“Chines bes‘ cook. Make sweet an‘ sour.”</p>
   <p>“What about food, liquor . . . ?”</p>
   <p>“Don‘t think liquor, sir. Better put in orange juice tin.”</p>
   <p>“I sen‘ cook tomorrow. You like have chicken an‘ warnuts?”</p>
   <p>“How can you put liquor in a juice can?”</p>
   <p>“Poke small hole and pour juice out, then pour liquor in and solder hole up.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe later,” I said. Mr. Hu offered me a chance at a laundryman and a hand-maiden of some sort, and we left.</p>

   <p>The Samoy jail was a hell of a poor place to be, even if they liked you, and Lars Lund wasn‘t talkative enough for any real friendship to spring up. They had an idea he knew where a lot of money was tucked away, and they were jealous of his company until he told them. I hadn‘t gotten in to see him before, but I had an idea today was the day, with Tommy along to do my talking. They hadn‘t let Ingred near the place. After I got in, I was glad; she wouldn‘t have liked what she saw.</p>
   <p>Lars was sitting on a wooden stool leaning against the wall, asleep. The guard nudged him.</p>
   <p>“Don‘t know,” Lars said. He didn‘t open his eyes. “Lars,” I said. “It‘s Bayard. I‘ve got some smokes for you.”</p>
   <p>He opened his eyes. They were glassy. He looked like hell. He had lost weight, and his color was like the kind of clay they make pipes out of in Ireland, and there were half a dozen festering cuts across his cheek and jaw. He was clean shaven, and his hair looked like it had just been combed—by an undertaker.</p>
   <p>“Hello, old boy,” Lars said. His voice was blurred. “Stay a while, won‘t you? Long as you‘re here I can sit down and catch a few winks … ”</p>
   <p>“Why don‘t you tell them what they want to know, Lars?” I said. “Then we can get you out of here.”</p>
   <p>“Don‘t know,” he said. “Good old Dasgupta . . . handled … ”</p>
   <p>‘“How are they treating you?”</p>
   <p>He opened his eyes again. “Lovely, old boy. Plenty of food, but rotten appetite, you know. Just no sleep. Even have a bearer to tend my kit. They‘re hanging him next week, though, so I‘ll have to . . . break . . . in … ”</p>
   <p>He was asleep again. There wasn‘t much I could do but stay and make motions as though we were talking, as long as they‘d let me. After a while the guard came back in and motioned me out and I watched them walk Lars away down the hall.</p>
   <p>When I got back to the office, Jakes went through the routine with his glasses and the clock. I looked at it, too.</p>
   <p>“Gracious,”I said. “I must have overslept.”</p>
   <p>“Mr. Paine called,” Jakes said. “Some time ago. He wishes you to come up.”</p>
   <p>“Tell him to drop dead,” I said. “I have my substantive work to think of.”</p>
   <p>Jakes whipped the hornrims off. “Eh?”</p>
   <p>“I said I‘m going right up.”</p>
   <p>Jakes sniffed, mashed the glasses back in place and watched me out of the room.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Paine didn‘t seem to feel any better for my being there. I had the feeling Samoy was getting him down; some of the old polish was wearing off.</p>
   <p>“I called at eight, Mr. Bayard,” he said. “It‘s nearly ten now.”</p>
   <p>I agreed with him.</p>
   <p>“Is it your habit to arrive at the office in mid-morning?”</p>
   <p>I indicated that I had no such annoying habit.</p>
   <p>“Where were you, Mr. Bayard, during the time I‘ve been waiting to talk with you?”</p>
   <p>“At the Samoy Prison.” I said.</p>
   <p>“Just visiting,” I added.</p>
   <p>“Visiting! Whom, may I ask … ”</p>
   <p>“A very sick friend.”</p>
   <p>“You‘ve been to the prison? You‘ve seen this what-ever-his-name-is? This embezzler?”</p>
   <p>“Lund,” I said. “Lars Lund. You know, I wrote you a little memo about him.”</p>
   <p>Paine‘s fist slammed the desk-top. “I don‘t care what his infernal name may be, Bayard! Haven‘t you sense enough at this point, to try to keep the Embassy clear of this mess?”</p>
   <p>“That‘s a little tough now, Mr. Paine,” I said, “inasmuch as the Embassy put him there.”</p>
   <p>“You provided this fugitive with a weapon; you were observed, entering and leaving his house at rather unusual hours; now you openly associate with the man in a prison cell. Have you taken leave of your senses?”</p>
   <p>I didn‘t try to answer that one.</p>
   <p>“Very well, Bayard,” Paine said. “I‘ll spell it out. There‘ll be no more visits to Samoy Jail, for any reason or in any manner. Do I make myself quite clear?”</p>
   <p>I agreed it was clear.</p>
   <p>“Now,” Paine said. “I called you here to inform you you‘re to act as Control Officer for the duration of the visit of the inspection team. You‘ll handle all details of transportation, appointments, supplies, whatever Mr. Tate may require. Any questions?”</p>
   <p>I couldn‘t think of a single question, except maybe what was this going to do to Jakes‘ substantive work, so I left quietly.</p>
   <subtitle>2</subtitle>
   <p>Things were really breaking right, Bert reflected with satisfaction. Imagine the Deputy Prime Minister asking him, Bert Sutton, to be his guest aboard his boat for two days. It just showed that taking the time to always pour on the charm with the locals paid off. What an opportunity to really get in solid with the top government people; and his stock would go up with the Ambassador too. He‘d have to ask for a couple of days leave. There was the big fire in shanty-town last night to check into, but somebody else could handle that; this was the kind of break a man needed, to shine with the Ambassador. He‘d get into see MacWaithe personally; Paine might very well conceal the whole thing from the Ambassador, otherwise. He could just picture the Ambassador‘s face.</p>
   <p>“Yes, Mr. Ambassador, Chaw has asked me to join him for a few days aboard his yacht. We like to get together every so often … ”</p>
   <p>Oh, this was really great. And it would be a perfect time to break it to Ruth. She wouldn‘t make such a scene, among strangers, big shots; and if she did act up, at least the Embassy gossips wouldn‘t see it. And it would make her realize what a big future Bert Sutton had, how a back number like her just didn‘t fit in.</p>
   <p>Marie, now; that was something different. She had acted pretty crazy last night when he told her, all that crazy laughing and crying. Didn‘t say anything that made any sense, but after all, you couldn‘t blame the poor kid. It must have been really something to her, to realize that she was going to step up into Bert Sutton‘s circle, after living like a slave as the wife of an FSO-8. Wait till he told her about this! She‘d be impressed, all right. She‘d had a hard time, but it was all over now. He‘d better hurry up and call Ruth. They had to be down at the pier at two-thirty.</p>
   <subtitle>3</subtitle>
   <p>L. P. Tate looked out through the window of the car at the blackened expanse, studded with charred posts, heaps of ash, and unburned metalware. Samoyans wandered through the ruins, kicking at piles of debris, stooping to salvage a salable item, occasionally skipping as a bare foot touched a hot spot.</p>
   <p>“How many did they say burned to death, Bayard? Fifteen or so? Don‘t see any of the bodies.”</p>
   <p>The car moved slowly past a fire-seared cow lying at the edge of the road. The animal lifted its head and bleated mournfully. Two men crossed the road carrying a pole from which a charred pig hung inverted, legs tied, squealing vigorously.</p>
   <p>“Roast pork on the hoof, eh?” Tate chuckled. “How much ground would you say was burned over here, Bayard?”</p>
   <p>“Maybe a hundred acres.”</p>
   <p>“No damn wonder these shanty-towns burn down, folks living in grass huts, kerosene lanterns all over the place. Damn fools.” Tate craned. “Look there, up ahead, where the big section of sewer pipe is—that must be where the seven kids burned alive. He stared as the car moved past the blackened death trap.</p>
   <p>“You know,” Tate went on, “I‘ve got an idea these fires are no accident. I think maybe the government sets ‘em. Slum clearance.” Tate nodded to himself. “One way to get rid of the squatters.”</p>
   <p>Tate eyed Bayard. Sullen, hey? No wonder he had everybody down on him. When the Embassy staff came flocking in to unload their dirt, as usual, most of them had something to say about this fellow. Secretaries said he ordered them round like servants; Admin Officer with a whole list, including knocking down the ICA chief. Feckel with his tip that the fellow was undermining the Economic Section, scaring off Americans out here to look after their businesses; locals all up at arms, persecution. Then to top if off, Paine says he‘s mixed up in the airline swindle, black market stuff, and openly sleeps with the sister of the Scandahoovian bird the cops have in the local calaboose. Quite a boy . . .</p>
   <p>“Hey, look at that! Will you look at that!” Tate was staring out at a group of Samoyans around a blackened shape laid out on the road.</p>
   <p>“There‘s one of the bodies, Bayard, A big fella, wasn‘t he?” Tate stared. A uniformed policeman stepped out, waved the car past. Tate turned to look through the rear window. “There comes another one … ”</p>
   <p>The car moved on, emerged from the burn. “Where to, Mr. Tate?” Bayard asked.</p>
   <p>Tate extracted a pocket watch, blinked at it. “Getting close to dinner time. Might as well mosey back to the hotel.” Tate leaned back, relaxed. Yes, sir, there was plenty on this bozo, all right. Department laid it right at his doorstep, up to him to decide what to do. Consider the local situation, determine degree of culpability, popular sentiment . . . the same old hog-wash. Meant to find out what good the Embassy might get out of throwing this Jasper to the dogs; might be just what it took to show the Samoyans we were their pals. Tate snorted. Too damned much coddling of these upstart countries now. Always thinking up another way to make ‘em love us, pouring in the money. Afraid maybe the Russians are going to score ahead of us. In a place like this, let ‘em! More damn trouble than it‘s worth.</p>
   <p>And you had to think twice about turning a white man over to these little brown men. Another chink in the wall, no pun intended. Give ‘em ideas. Next thing you know, where‘s your white supremacy? Them or us.</p>
   <p>The thing for an old hand to do is not go off half-cocked. Look it over calmly, see just what we‘ve got here. Bayard, on everybody‘s list. But what does it amount to? Not a damn thing. Same old hokum they always cooked up when a newcomer didn‘t go along with the pecking order. Hell, that was the way it had to be; couldn‘t have every Tom, Dick and Harry with a crusader complex breaking up a smooth running set-up. He‘d written off his share of that kind of hard-nose himself.</p>
   <p>But it was time to smarten up. What good did L. P. Tate get out of tossing these birds out? Not a damn bit. Sure, the Admin people he worked with on these things were always appreciative, they understood each other, a few little favors; but there was mere in it than that. This Jasper here, now. Out, he‘d be no damn good to anybody; but in—because of the support of L. P. Tate—now that was something different. Hed checked the file; the man had a big military record; hemight go somewhere if he weathered this. And a few years from now, when he was Principal Officer at some nice little post—or holding down a key spot in a big Embassy—L. P. Tate could expect pretty nice treatment, coming in, say, as a businessman. After retirement next year, he still had plenty of years ahead. With a finger in a pie here and there, and the right contacts inside the Department, hed write his own ticket. And it was time now to start building a stable of friends; grateful friends.</p>
   <p>“When we get to the hotel, Bayard, come on up for a drink. I‘d like to have a little talk with you.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>He had put it to him nice, Tate thought, looking at Bayard over the rim of his glass. He didn‘t say much, sat there and looked dumb, but he got the idea, all right. Hard for these stiff-necked ones to face facts, but he knew where he stood. Now, when he found himself white-washed, in the clear, he‘d know who had him in the palm of his hand. And he‘d be mighty appreciative; he‘d work at being appreciative. He‘d better, damn him. It was never too late to set the dogs on him.</p>
   <p>This was going to be all right! Should have thought of this a year ago. Pretty good feeling, having people around that had such ‘good reasons to want to please. Might as well let him get started. What did he need now? Had plenty of Scotch, what else . . .</p>
   <p>“Say, Brion.” Tate smiled. Bayard looked up.</p>
   <p>“You know, Brion, I‘ve heard a lot about these oriental beauties out here, but—maybe you wont believe this—I never tried one out for myself. Tate chuckled. Im feeling in the mood for a little relaxation tonight; why dont you round up a nice little girl and send her up here. Heck, all work and no play— Tate took another pull at his glass. This boy ought to know some dandies; he had the kind of looks women liked, ran around with hot-shots like that airline bozo . . .</p>
   <p>Bayard stood up, looking at Tate.</p>
   <p>“Mr. Tate, I‘ll be your errand boy, because those are my orders. But you‘ll have to be your own pimp.”</p>
   <p>Bayard walked out of the room. Tate sat, frozen, glass halfway to his mouth. Outside, distantly, a pi dog yelped.</p>

   <p>Marie Cummins picked up the mirror and looked at herself. You look like a tramp, she thought. Why not? Didn‘t all tramps look like tramps? And you look like a crazy woman, too. And for the same reason. She was going out of her mind, sitting here in the silent house, waiting for something. That was the terrible thing. Waiting for what? Where was Henry? She had to talk to Henry, maybe there was something . . .</p>
   <p>It made her feel sick to think about Bert. Don‘t think about him. He was crazy, too. Raving about divorces, they‘d get rid of their husbands and wives and then they‘d get married. And she thought she had him under such control . . . Walking down an aisle with Bert, that dry brown neck, bony fingers, then—locked in a coffin with spiders—</p>
   <p>Marie jumped up, holding back a scream. Where was Henry? She had to have help. She really was going crazy. She didn‘t want to die . . .</p>
   <p>What if Bert came now? . . . but he was away, on a Boat trip. That terrible chuckly voice on the phone, his friend the Prime Minister . . .</p>
   <p>“Please, Henry, come home now. I‘m worried .. Talking to herself now. Where was he? Last night, all day today, not at the office. Something had happened . . .</p>
   <p>Call Bradley, ask him, tell him about Henry—Yes, that would be natural. Please, Bradley, help me find Henry. Im worried …</p>
   <p>Downstairs, Marie hesitated. How could she call him now, after he had told her . . . But this was not the same. She really had to call him. It would be dark in a few hours. Then it would be too late. Quickly, before it was dark . . .</p>

    <p>Chapter Twelve</p>

   <p>How different everything was this morning, Bradley Paine thought. True, just one thing had happened; his faith in Marie Cummins had been renewed—but it put a different complexion on everything. How could he have believed there could be anything between Marie and a man like Sutton? It was his own hyper-sensitive ego, his sense of inadequacy which was responsible. Why had Marie not explained sooner? But the answer to that was again himself. He had hurt her deeply, forbidden her to call . . . Thank God she had turned to him, in spite of his idiocy. Now there were things which must be done.</p>
   <p>First, where the devil was Cummins? He could have Clint Lewis look into it through some of his contacts . . . Then Sutton. He would deal with him in a thorough fashion. Sutton was away at the moment, boating with Chaw. What was behind that? Odd . . . Well, he would see Sutton when he returned. There were several things to take a closer look at with regard to Sutton—in addition to his terrorizing of Marie—such as his eternal tale-carrying and favor-currying. He had tolerated the mans unwholesome neuroses long enough. Then Bayard—</p>
   <p>Aside from Sutton‘s charges, what was there, actually? A gun registered in Bayard‘s name was in the possession of the Swedish chap. Bayard stated that he had given it to him—how had he put it? —some days ago. Probably long before this thing came up. After all, hed been squiring the girl about for months. Couldnt blame him for that; she was lovely. As for spending the night with the girl—any man who wouldnt want to make love to a pretty creature like that was abnormal. It proved nothing. Actually, the entire business was no more than a fabric of speculation. His own jaundiced viewpoint had colored everything, and . . . wasnt there a little jealousy there? After his own unhappy thoughts as to Marie, he had envied the chap. As for the poor devil in prison, that was another item to do something about. Feckels job, of course, but hed check to be sure the man was receiving decent treatment. Beastly, rotting in Samoy jail . . .</p>
   <p>The buzzer sounded softly.</p>
   <p>“Bradley? Will you drop over a moment?”</p>
   <p>Paine rose and headed for the Ambassador‘s office. He would have to give him his thinking on Bayard, give the man a chance to clear himself. If he had actually had nothing to do with the escapade, as now seemed at least possible, there remained nothing of substance against him.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Tate was with the Ambassador, glowering from his chair beside the desk. At a nod, Paine took a chair.</p>
   <p>“Mr. Tate and I have been discussing the Bayard affair, Bradley. We have decided there‘s no point in delaying action any longer … “ The Ambassador paused, glanced at Tate.</p>
   <p>“Where is Bayard now, Paine?” Tate looked at the Ambassador. “Let‘s have him up here now, Mr. Ambassador, before he gets out on the town somewhere.”</p>
   <p>“Mr. Ambassador, I had a few points— Paine started.</p>
   <p>“Bradley, put in a call to the Foreign Office. Get the Foreign Minister on the phone for me. And advise the Minister of the Interior. Call Bayard to your office and keep him engaged there until they arrive.”</p>
   <p>“Be sure you‘ve got him here before he finds out what‘s up, Paine.” Tate said. “We don‘t want a man-hunt all over the city.”</p>
   <p>The Ambassador was glancing busily through the papers before him, not meeting Paine‘s eye. “I have an important luncheon, Bradley: I‘ll rely on you to handle this matter.”</p>
   <p>“Just what‘s going on here, Mr. Ambassador?” Paine looked from one to the other. “I‘m afraid I don‘t quite understand.”</p>
   <p>“I think that ought to be obvious, Paine,” Tate said. “We‘re waiving diplomatic immunity on Bayard.”</p>
   <subtitle>2</subtitle>
   <p>. . . Paine was waiting as I came through the door. He jerked his head at me and went a few steps along the corridor and waited for me to catch up.</p>
   <p>“Where the devil have you been, Bayard? I‘ve been looking for you.”</p>
   <p>“I would have been visiting Lund,” I said, “but I couldn‘t get in.”</p>
   <p>“I was under the impression I‘d told you to stay away from the jail.”</p>
   <p>“Lund is a sick man; he needs a doctor—and a lawyer.</p>
   <p>“All right, Bayard; it will be taken care of. But there‘s something I want to ask you. That gun; when did you actually give it to this fellow? Some weeks or months ago, I presume? Long before the present scandal—</p>
   <p>“The night he left town,” I said.</p>
   <p>“Eh? But you told me earlier you had given it to him sometime—</p>
   <p>“I was having one of my bad days.”</p>
   <p>“You—well; tell me, Bayard. Just what do you have to do with this business?</p>
   <p>“I didn‘t want to see the kid in a Samoyan jail cell,” I said. “And I was right.”</p>
   <p>“Perhaps you were. Very well, Bayard. I believe you. Now I have something to tell you … ”</p>
   <p>I waited.</p>
   <p>“Brion, I‘m supposed to decoy you into my office and hold you until the police arrive. The Ambassador is waiving your diplomatic immunity.”</p>
   <p>“You lost me on that one,” I said. “Why are the police interested in me?”</p>
   <p>“They want to question you in this Lund affair.”</p>
   <p>I let that sink in. It took a minute.</p>
   <p>“That‘s dandy,” I said. “Fortunately, I‘ve been very polite to the boys down at the jail, so we ought to get along famously.”</p>
   <p>“There was nothing I could do, Brion. I don‘t know what to advise you, except to get out of the chancery at once and think it over. I don‘t want to know your plans. And good luck.”</p>
   <p>Paine walked off, just a well-tailored back moving down the hall. The Embassy had just eased out from under me, and I was on my own.</p>
   <p>Somebody called my name, and I turned around without too much enthusiasm, but it was only Jakes, on his way to the Lower Compound after pots and pans for the needy and wanting somebody to go along, in case there was any work involved. I wanted to get out of the Embassy long enough to do some thinking. The police were probably watching my house and the airport. I didn‘t have any better ideas yet, so we left together.</p>
   <p>We followed the third Embassy-dispatched truck into the burn area. There were already a few bamboo mats strung to the charred poles of burned huts along the road, and housekeeping was resuming among the ashes. Ahead, a crowd had gathered around the other two trucks, parked at the side of the road, with more crowding in to get a share in the free rice and pots and blankets the Embassy ladies had donated.</p>
   <p>I got out of the jeep; Jakes stayed at the wheel, giving a sour look to a kid who seemed to think Jakes was funny. I went up toward the truck ahead, and noticed two men up on top, shaking out a banner in a business-like way. They slid down and tied the bottom edge to the bed of the truck. The Embassy driver craned his neck to watch. They finished up and moved on.</p>
   <p>The big yellow hammer and sickle on the red cheesecloth background was drawing admiring glances from the crowd. I got out my pocket knife, pushed through, cut the cords holding the bottom of the flag, and yanked. It ripped, came free, leaving a long red strip fluttering gaily. I bundled the flag and tossed it toward the ditch. Eager hands seized it and moved off quarreling over the division.</p>
   <p>The two climbers were busy on the truck ahead now. I walked up beside it, caught one by a skinny ankle, and heaved. He fell in the mud with a yell. The other chap looked down and yelped. I took the dangling corner of the flag in both hands and pulled. It came away, spread itself on the ground. I stepped into the center of it and looked up at the man on the truck.</p>
   <p>“Get down, Junior,” I said. “The party‘s over.”</p>
   <p>He waved his arms and shouted at the crowd. He turned and scrambled down, pointed at the muddy flag—</p>
   <p>“Yankee pig!” he said. He motioned at the flag, then at the truck. “You put back!” He made a fast move and there was a knife in his hand. I took it away from him, threw it in the ditch, and tossed him after it, and headed back toward the jeep.</p>
   <p>Jakes was standing up, staring. The crowd was getting noisy, yells rang out.</p>
   <p>“What is it?” Jakes said.</p>
   <p>I swung into the seat. “Time to go, Jakes.”</p>
   <p>Jakes sat down, “What?”</p>
   <p>“Don‘t argue. Turn this thing around. Fast.”</p>
   <p>Jakes‘ eyes took on a worried look behind the thick lenses. He turned the jeep, backed, started off along the road. The crowd was in no hurry to give way. The noise was growing behind us. Someone was screeching, exhorting. Up ahead, they were shaking fists; a stone bounced off the hood.</p>
   <p>I reached across, blew the horn. “Roll it, Jakes,” I said, “unless you‘re good at arguing with a mob.” The jeep jumped ahead; shouting bystanders skipped out of its way. A group in the road ahead scattered, leaving one man holding up both palms. He dropped one to hitch up his wraparound skirt, held his ground. Jakes swerved to cut around the man as he leaped—squarely into the path of the jeep. Jakes cut the wheel, mud sluiced, and there was a heavy shock and the face snapped down out of sight.</p>
   <p>“My God, that man I hit him! You saw, I couldn‘t help—</p>
   <p>“Gun this thing!” I slammed my foot over Jakes‘. The jeep leaped forward with Jakes wrestling the wheel. The road cleared, clods flew wide of the mark; there was a blur of angry faces, running figures, stooping to throw again; and then we were clear, and bystanders merely stared as the jeep hurtled past.</p>
   <p>“We‘ve got to go back,” Jakes cried, “explain—</p>
   <p>“Samoyans have got a thing about being run over,” I said. “Keep going.”</p>
   <p>“What . . . what shall we do?”</p>
   <p>“Head for the Queen Street garage; we‘ll have to get this jeep out of sight. You can slow down now.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Jakes gave the garage key to the attendant and turned to me.</p>
   <p>“I . . . we‘d better go to the Chancery at once, report this … ”</p>
   <p>I climbed out of the jeep. “You go ahead, Ben. I‘ve got a late date.”</p>
   <p>“You‘d better come with me, Bayard. You saw it. I couldn‘t help—</p>
   <p>“I‘m not going. So long, Ben.”</p>
   <p>Jakes goggled at me.</p>
   <p>“It was your fault! You were the one who told me to speed! What did you do back there, to arouse the locals? Here . . . !” He was still talking as I rounded the corner.</p>
   <subtitle>3</subtitle>
   <p>“Stop here,” Marshal-to-be Yin-Yin barked, staring out at the mob pouring along Daijee Street. The battered taxi halted with a chattering of brakes. “What set this rabble off?”</p>
   <p>“I do not know, Yin-Yin. How can I know? I have only just come, as you yourself—</p>
   <p>“Shut up, imbecile!” This one was a greater fool than Oon had been. “Get out; learn what has happened here.”</p>
   <p>Yin-Yin waited impatiently. After five minutes the fellow returned.</p>
   <p>“It was the white men, Yin-Yin. They came in an auto, and beat our chaps who were tying People‘s flags on the lorries of the Yankees, after which they drove through the people, calling down curses, killing many, and then they—</p>
   <p>“Yankees? Do they know of— No, it was impossible; the corpses had burned to a crisp in the fire, as Koom said. It was ill luck, nothing more. And now this horde of fools must be placated . . .</p>
   <p>“Go around to the other side, come up along Jow Street,” Yin-Yin commanded. The taxi moved off, Yin-Yin peering out at the surging crowd. This lot could spoil everything, rioting about without orders. The dogs would learn a little discipline when Marshal Yin-Yin dictated from Government House . . .</p>
   <p>The car halted at a cross street where the capering fore-rank of the mob had just begun to flow across the wider street. Yin-Yin climbed out, stepped up on the fender of the taxi. He raised his arms.</p>
   <p>“Brothers! Samoyan people! I, Yin-Yin, come to tell you the dogs of imperialist oppressors shall not long continue to grind us down under the wheels of autos!”</p>
   <p>The mob‘s vanguard was gone now, and the street overflowed with the crowd, pressing forward.</p>
   <p>‘To the Yankee Embassy!” a man screeched. “Kill the foreigners!”</p>
   <p>“No, no,” Yin-Yin screamed. “The time is not yet ripe! First—</p>
   <p>No one was listening. The willful fools hurried past, bent on looting and killing, caring nothing for the labor of months . . .</p>
   <p>“Stop, fools! Idiots! Disperse! I, Yin-Yin, command—</p>
   <p>Hands pulled at Yin-Yin‘s feet. He slipped, fell, scrambled up.</p>
   <p>“An eater of white man‘s offal,” someone cried. “A lackey … ”</p>
   <p>“No, I am with you!” Sudden terror gripped Yin-Yin. It was hideous, hearing the phrases he had with such toil taught these mindless ones, hurled now at him. There was death in their eyes.</p>
   <p>“I am the first to spit in the face of the Yankee dogs!”</p>
   <p>“On to the Embassy of the Yankees!” someone called.</p>
   <p>“Are you with us?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, yes, I am with you!” Yin-Yin sobbed with relief as the angry-eyed ones moved on. He followed a way, then fell back and made his way to the car, clambered in, and sank back in the seat.</p>
   <p>“Drive to the Yankee Embassy,” he gasped. Too late now to stop them. The Day had come, and now he could only seize upon it, turn it to his will, and fulfill his destiny.</p>
   <subtitle>4</subtitle>
   <p>“So soon!” said the Minister of the Interior. “We had thought at least a week or two more—</p>
   <p>“Some foreigners ran down a man;” the Police Inspector replied. “I think the Communists too are surprised; but they will leap in quickly now, to direct the riots; it will be as they have planned, only a few days sooner than their auspicious date.”</p>
   <p>“It is as well; my astrologer finds today most favorable for undertaking political activity.”</p>
   <p>“Mine as well. The omen is good. My men are ready.”</p>
   <p>“You must watch carefully; no serious damage or injury must be done. We wish only to let the Americans see the danger, quake in their boots a while; then they will be all the more grateful when the excellent police disperse the mob; but not if there has been any unfortunate incident.”</p>
   <p>“I will watch carefully.”</p>
   <subtitle>5</subtitle>
   <p>“Men will die for this,” Little Tiger cried. “I was a fool to place my trust in Samoyans, let them hold posts of responsibility. Now ruin is loosed upon the city.”</p>
   <p>“It is only a little riot, Great Leader. Maybe no one will take notice—</p>
   <p>“Begone, cretinous eater of droppings! Am I surrounded by fools?”</p>
   <p>“But—</p>
   <p>“My hand is forced! May the wild swine devour them! The mob that I would have led to spoils greater than they can dream now capers in the eye of the cannon— Little Tiger stopped abruptly. He walked to his battered desk, suddenly calm.</p>
   <p>“I am as big a fool as they,” he said, “to rail at Fate.” He pointed at a man suddenly. “You! Send word to those at the army depot. The hour is now! Let them act!” He turned to another. “Take word to our men outside the city! Let them come now, in readiness. Koom! Let thy brothers sharpen their dahs! You know the plans we have laid against this hour. Act now; and let not one lackey of the Cabinet live to burn his evening incense!”</p>
   <p>Little Tiger stood. “I myself go now to soothe this rabble before the Yankee Embassy. There must be no killing there; it is the command from the Leader of All.”</p>
   <subtitle>6</subtitle>
   <p>Now, Yin-Yin knew, standing at the edge of the crowd, he must quickly send word to the depot. The arms must be seized at once, before any chance of interference. Then—he turned at a shout.</p>
   <p>“Yin-Yin! You! You led this rabble here?”</p>
   <p>Little Tiger came up to him, face contorted with rage. Did the Chinaman think he, Yin-Yin, was so great a fool as that? He had done what he could, but a mob was like a tide of the sea. But why explain to the Chinaman? His usefulness was past; no need now of foreign agitators. It was the Day, and Yin-Yin was in command . . . .</p>
   <p>“Silence, Chinese noise-maker! I am here ahead of thee, as usual, to do what I can with this horde … ”</p>
   <p>“You speak thus to me, pig of a Samoyan?”</p>
   <p>“Pig, is it? Was it not I who took the spies while you groaned on the floor, with the puke of the white man in the three hairs of thy beard?” Yin-Yin laughed and turned away. “Stay near, Chinaman! I may have work for thee,” he called off-handedly. Where was Koom? The assassins must—</p>
   <p>Little Tiger eyed a spot on Yin-Yin‘s back. Just there, below the grease-stain. The slender knife flicked, and he eased the body to the littered cobbles. He glanced about. The yelling men nearby at the edge of the mob paid no notice. What was a fainting man? Now there was work to do if the day were to be saved.</p>
   <subtitle>7</subtitle>
   <p>. . . The police car pulled to the curb and three short burly men in the khaki uniforms of the Samoyan Police spilled out and moved to surround me loosely.</p>
   <p>“Mr. Bayard?”</p>
   <p>I said nothing. I wouldn‘t have to worry about what to do now; that was settled.</p>
   <p>One of the policemen touched his cap. “Please, Mr. Bayard, to accompany us to police headquarters, for a routine interview.”</p>
   <p>“Sure, why not?” They hadn‘t wasted any time; it hadn‘t been more than three hours since Paine tipped me off.</p>
   <p>Odd, about Paine warning me. I wondered why. He was a little late, though. A little too late.</p>
   <subtitle>8</subtitle>
   <p>In his office at Army Headquarters, General Winjee beat his fists against the desk. “You told me two weeks, ex-Colonel Pang! Two weeks, you swore it! Now, while you debauch yourself in your quarters, this pack of coolies broaches the depot and makes off with all! ALL! The half-track, the machine guns, all!”</p>
   <p>“I but rested quietly after my tiffin, Winjee! How do I know these—</p>
   <p>“Enough! Gather the gutter scavengings you call an infantry brigade, and stand ready to march! I make my move this day, guns or no!”</p>
   <p>Pang fled. Winjee snatched up the telephone, shouted furiously, slammed it back. A frightened non-commissioned officer came in, saluted awkwardly.</p>
   <p>“Sergeant!” Winjee screeched, “I want your motor pool ready to move a brigade of men in thirty minutes. Fuel, oil, water, rations loaded, everything!”</p>
   <p>Pigs! Winjee thought. Crawlers in dark places! Ravishers of pet goats! Snatch his coup from his fingers on the eve of its accomplishment, would they? But perhaps he would fool them! One column to the scene of the riot, another to Government House, and Major Yaw and his Special Team to their tasks inside; and patrols at the waterfront, and at the utilities plants. Martial law, a ruthless stamping out of the dogs of Communists, and a new, strong regime in Samoy, with General Winjee at its head. How he would like to see the head of Chaw, that greedy rascal, impaled—</p>
   <p>Winjee slapped his forehead. Thundering devils! Chaw was out of the city! Away, boating, had they not said? What benefit to send the Special Team to wipe out all the Cabinet, even the dummy Prime Minister, and leave its head, the real ruler, Chaw, free and breathing? Outdone! Wretched stars! Unlucky Winjee!</p>
   <p>But why despair? Winjee sat bolt upright. A column sent to the river to intercept the boating party, and it was done! Rake the decks with machine gun fire, and burn the hulk. Winjee strode to the door, yelled. He himself would lead the column; there must be no blunder here.</p>
   <subtitle>9</subtitle>
   <p>On the deck of the State Barge, Ruth Sutton eyed Bert, sprawled in the next chair, collar open, a drink in his hand. Might as well bring it up now, and get it over with. There wouldn‘t be any better time than now, and this was why she had come, after all. Floating around this sewer on this creaky old boat, drinking warm whiskey in the heat of the day wasn‘t her idea of a pleasure cruise. Bert had been knocking himself out being jolly with those over-sleek government men all morning; now that he was flopped down beside her, she‘d better seize the opportunity. It was really a break, his bringing her along. Why in the world had he, anyway?</p>
   <p>“Bert, I have to talk to you. I think . . . well, Bert, we really haven‘t had anything you‘d call a marriage for years now, have we?”</p>
   <p>Bert looked at her, frowning. “What?”</p>
   <p>“We hardly talk to each other; we have no interests in common; we don‘t seem to have the same values in life … ”</p>
   <p>“What‘s this all about?” Bert interrupted. “You‘re not going to start in on me to take up a hobby again?”</p>
   <p>Ruth stared; then she laughed. “Yes, it‘s your hobby I wanted to talk about … ”</p>
   <p>She fell silent as Bert‘s four drinking buddies trouped up. Bert hopped to his feet, slapped backs. There went her chance. These sharpies seemed to love Bert like a brother; they hardly let him out of their sight . . . .</p>
   <subtitle>10</subtitle>
   <p>“What do you mean, phoning me at the office on an open line!” Harvey Throst demanded. “You know better than—</p>
   <p>“I could not help it, Colonel. I have important news. I cannot come now, through the demonstrators—</p>
   <p>“All right, what is it? And hurry up. This is risky business.”</p>
   <p>“Remember that I have always served you well, Colonel; I ask it. I take great risks—</p>
   <p>“Come to the point!”</p>
   <p>“General Winjee has left the city with a company of troops, via lorry. Their destination is Lashku Village, at the tidal flats, where the river bends back on itself. There they lie in wait for the party of the Deputy Prime Minister. From the bank, machine gun fire—</p>
   <p>Throst felt his face go white. “How the hell do you know—who said—never mind; how long ago did they leave?</p>
   <p>“Less than thirty minutes, Colonel. Remember my—</p>
   <p>“You be standing in front of the Customs warehouse on Strand Road in ten minutes. I‘ll need a guide.” Throst slammed the phone down. His hands were trembling. Ruth was on that boat. Ruth . . .</p>
   <p>He went to the safe, twirled the dial, cursed, started over. He pulled open the door, took out a web pistol belt with a holstered .45, strapped it on. He went to the door, glanced down the hall; no one in sight. They were all up front, watching the show; the yells of the mob were a steady roar. Throst walked down the hall to the back stair, pushed past a startled sweeper sleeping on the landing, went down the stairs. A marine in civilian clothes stood by the rear entrance. He turned, nodded.</p>
   <p>“Hello, Colonel.”</p>
   <p>“Hi, Murph. Open up. Fm going out.”</p>
   <p>The Marine hesitated. “My orders were—</p>
   <p>“Your new orders are to open up,” Throst snapped. “Make it fast.”</p>
   <p>In the alley it was quiet Throst loosened the automatic in its bolster. They‘d better not get in his way . . .</p>
   <p>The side street was deserted. All the action was out front; good. The staff car was across the street, the driver nowhere in sight. Probably out front, whooping it up . . .</p>
   <p>Throst started the car, cut the wheel, and U-turned, gunned away up the street. There weren‘t many people around. Big day in Samoy. Let‘s all go throw rocks through the windows of the U.S. Embassy. They‘ll give us another big loan as soon as we stop, to cement relations. And that son of a bitch had better not beat me. Twenty miles, maybe. I can beat him, easy, if this damned car can get through; please, God. Let me beat him . . . .</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>Inside the Embassy, the roar of the mob filling Victoria Square was like the yowling of a sea of angry cats. Sitting at Bradley Paine‘s desk in the chancery, Horace Zwicker cupped a hand over the phone. “I‘m a little worried, Mr. Ambassador,” he said, leaning close over the instrument. ‘This is a little more serious than anything we‘ve had before … ”</p>
   <p>“I‘m relying on your judgment, Zwicker, to handle it calmly. Don‘t get excited. We‘ve weathered demonstrations in the past. I hardly think it‘s worth my breaking up an important luncheon.”</p>
   <p>“I‘d feel a lot better if you were here, Mr. Ambassador. I‘m not sure I can handle this.”</p>
   <p>“Nonsense, Zwicker. No need for panic. I‘ll call the Foreign Minister, and urge him to disperse them. And if there are any other developments, by all means call me back here at the Residence.”</p>
   <p>“Very well, sir. I‘ll . . . do my best.” Zwicker turned back to the group gathered in the office. “Well, you heard, gentlemen; the Ambassador feels it‘s not serious.” Zwicker licked his lips nervously.</p>
   <p>“Maybe if he could hear the sound of breaking glass, he‘d feel differently,” Kerrigan said. “That mob‘s getting bigger … ”</p>
   <p>“Where‘s Brad Paine?” Pitts asked.</p>
   <p>“I don‘t know,” Zwicker threw out his hands. “He left the building a short time before this thing started, and left no indication of where he was going.”</p>
   <p>Lewis cleared his throat. “I don‘t know how you feel, but . . . ah . . . wouldn‘t it be a good idea to evacuate the building, I mean, send all non-essential personnel home? No point … “ He looked at the others. “Well, there‘ll be no work done as long as this is going on.”</p>
   <p>“Look,” Feinstein said. “What are you, crazy? You want to walk out there now, go ahead. Count me out. I‘m staying inside.”</p>
   <p>“Now, gentlemen, after all, this is nothing to grow unduly alarmed over. We‘ve weathered demonstrations before.”</p>
   <p>“First time they ever busted out the glass,” Pitts said.</p>
   <p>“What are we going to do, Horace?”</p>
   <p>Zwicker looked at Kerrigan. “What‘s your idea, Howie?”</p>
   <p>“You‘re senior, Horace. I‘m content to follow your lead. But I think this is going to get worse before it gets better.”</p>
   <p>“I probably shouldn‘t toss this out,” Lewis said, “but I‘ve spotted two known Red extremists in the front rank of this bunch. They‘re working on the crowd, shaping it up. They‘re up to something.”</p>
   <p>“This is U.S. soil, after all, gentlemen, technically,” Zwicker said. “I don‘t think they‘ll go so far as to actually violate the Embassy.”</p>
   <p>“Look here, Mr. Zwicker,” Tom Hurd said. “If those guys out there start getting any funny ideas, I don‘t want to be around. I think the smart thing to do is get out of here while we got a chance.”</p>
   <p>“So who‘s got a chance?” Feinstein called. “You‘re nuts. In here they can‘t lay a hand on us. I‘m staying.”</p>
   <p>“Now, gentlemen, there‘ll be no talk of abandoning the Chancery; after all, there are papers here, safes, code keys—its impossible.</p>
   <p>“Not everybody, of course, Zwicker,” Lewis said. “Just the non-essential personnel. We can get everything into the vault, and post the Marine guards to protect it, and then just quietly slip out.”</p>
   <p>“I suppose there‘s no need of even-one staying, Clint How do you others feel?”</p>
   <p>“Me, I‘m staving.” Fearacem said.</p>
   <p>“The locals all left an hour ago,” Hurd said. “Most of ‘em.”</p>
   <p>“No bunch of gooks gonna run me out of my office,” Pitts said.</p>
   <p>“Mr. Zwicker, you got to get the ladies out of here. They‘ll need somebody to go with ‘em.” Tom Hurd looked around. “If nobody else—</p>
   <p>“Very well. Tom,” Zwicker said. “You‘ll convoy the ladies out. I think that makes sense.”</p>
   <p>“I better take the back way. I‘ll get ‘em rounded up.”</p>
   <p>“Now, just a moment, Tom. I think you‘d better not attempt stealth. Just go out openly, show them—</p>
   <p>“I‘m not showing them anything, Mr. Zwicker. I‘m just getting the hell out the back way. The rest of you better think about it.”</p>
   <p>“Think I‘ll go along, Hard,” Lewis said. “That is, if you‘ve got no objection, Zwicker?”</p>
   <p>“I want everything secured first,” Zwicker said. “No security violations, now. We must do this thing in an orderly way. Since apparently there are some who feel it‘s advisable to leave, I‘ll interpose no objection, so long as there‘s no compromising of duty.”</p>
   <p>“Me go out there?” Feinstein said. “Ha!”</p>
   <p>“Now, those of you who wish to remain … ”</p>
   <subtitle>2</subtitle>
   <p>“All right,” Tom Hurd announced loudly, “I got you girls together down here to tell you we‘re getting you out of the building. I and Mr. Zwicker have decided maybe this thing is going to build up into something, and naturally we got to look out for you ladies first. I been appointed to take you out Now—</p>
   <p>“This is crazy,” a woman called. “What‘s the idea, Hurd?”</p>
   <p>“OK, Thelma, keep your shirt on. Nobody‘s forcing you. Any of you ladies don‘t want to get out now while you got a chance, OK. Now, we got no time to waste. We‘re going out the back, and head for the cars parked along Ponjee Street. I counted from the window upstairs, and there‘s six cars out there. How many we got here?”</p>
   <p>Tom counted heads.</p>
   <p>“Twenty-four. OK, that‘s four to a car. There‘ll be a couple more fellas along in a minute. Now, I want you in fours; first bunch takes the last car, and gets going; next bunch behind them; I don‘t want any blocking the street.”</p>
   <p>Clint Lewis came into the room, Taylor at his side.</p>
   <p>“ . . . Of course, if it would serve any useful purpose, I‘d stay.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, sure, that‘s understood. Of course, I‘m just an outsider … ”</p>
   <p>Ben Jakes hurried in. The File Room and Code Room clerks and two enlisted men from the Army Attache‘s office followed.</p>
   <p>“OK, that makes thirty-one, and me is thirty-two. We‘ll put six in the first two cars, and five in the rest. No jamming the doors now. OK, follow me.” Tom moved off down the hall, the others following. At the door, he stopped and turned. The Marine guard watched expressionlessly. “All right, let‘s have one man to each car, to drive. All you guys drive OK?”</p>
   <p>“Sure, Tom.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, let‘s get going.”</p>
   <p>“OK, I‘ll drive the lead car. Wait a minute.” Hurd went into the adjacent office, tilted a slat of the Venetian blind. The street was deserted.</p>
   <p>“Let‘s go.” Hurd unlocked the door and stepped out, women crowding behind him. A lounging Samoyan at the end of the alley stared, dropped a cigarette, and ran out of the alley with a shout. Tom hesitated, then went ahead. At the end of the alley, he poked his head out. The man who had been on watch was yelling, pointing. The crowd in the street before the building were turning, some starting down the side street.</p>
   <p>“We gotta go back!” Tom turned. A solid wall of white-faced women pushed against him. “Get back!”</p>
   <p>They flowed past him, spreading out across the street. Hurd cursed, fought his way back. It was useless. Here was Jakes; Jakes might help him—Jakes knocked Hurd aside, sprinted for the first car.</p>
   <p>A car door slammed, someone screamed. An engine caught, tires squealed. Chester Taylor ran, clinging to a half-open door, tripped, skidded on the pavement face first, came up bloody. A second car started up, swung around. There were two women in the front seat. It roared off down the street. A thrown brick smashed on the pavement at Tom Hurd‘s feet; he jumped back, started for the third car. The mob had engulfed the first two in line now. A Samoyan ran up into the open door of the third car as Nancy Johnson reached it, caught her skirt and ripped it off. He capered, yelling, waving the garment aloft. Nancy yelped, scrambled in. The car started, backed quickly, knocking down odd members of the mob, sending Mabel Wisnieski sprawling in the gutter. Tom ran toward it with a shout, leaped back as it swerved toward him. He caught a glimpse of Clint Lewis‘ white face at the wheel twisted to see behind him.</p>
   <p>They were all around him now, filling the street. A path opened through the mob, and Tom ran for it. Something wet hit him in the face. A grimacing Samoyan leaped out, swung a blow, missed. Another raised a wooden slat, brought it down on his upraised arm. Tom ran. Something hit him on the head; warm blood ran down into his eyes. He rounded the corner into Mackenzie Street, the mob opening to let him through. Someone stooped, scooped dung from the gutter, threw it. Tom ducked, caught it full in the face. He gagged, cried out, ran on, his arms covering his head. Blows, jeers, stumbling and falling, then up, and running.</p>
   <subtitle>3</subtitle>
   <p>From the second-floor window, Zwicker, Pitts, Feinstein, Kerrigan, and Feckel crowded against the windows, watching, wide-eyed.</p>
   <p>“My God, they‘ll kill him!”</p>
   <p>“What‘s holding him up? The poor dumb son-of-a-bitch … ”</p>
   <p>“It‘s making me sick … ”</p>
   <p>“Where are the rest?”,</p>
   <p>“This was a mistake; a serious mistake.”</p>
   <p>Marine Sergeant Gus Ruggiano came up the stairs at a run, pushed through to the window. He stared.</p>
   <p>“He‘s OK; they‘re just roughing him up—</p>
   <p>“What do you mean, OK?—</p>
   <p>“They would have killed him by now if they were going to; the rest of them got through. Only about ten in the cars; the rest beat it on foot. The mob pushed them around a little, pulled the clothes off a couple of the women. They‘re OK.”</p>
   <p>“I shouldn‘t have let them go,” Zwicker said.</p>
   <p>“You couldn‘t help it, Horace,” Kerrigan said. “They insisted.”</p>
   <p>“Yes; but now do you hear what they‘re shouting?”</p>
   <p>The group fell silent, listening. The mob roar had become a ragged chant. The swirl of motion around Tom Hurd moved along through the scattered edge of the crowd, petered out. Tom ran, still covering his head, passed out of sight.</p>
   <p>“What‘s the chant?”</p>
   <p>“They‘re yelling for the Ambassador!”</p>
   <p>“They think everyone‘s come out now but the Ambassador, don‘t you see?” Zwicker said. “Now they‘re picturing themselves making him run the gauntlet like Hurd.”</p>
   <p>“But he‘s not here!”</p>
   <p>“They don‘t know that,” Zwicker said. “The limousine is parked out front. They think he‘s inside.”</p>
   <p>“His driver brought it down here to gas up,” Ruggiano said.</p>
   <p>“Our tough luck,” Pitts said. “That‘s got ‘em all hopped up now.”</p>
   <p>“Well, let‘s tell them,” Feckel said. “Call out to them that he‘s not here!”</p>
   <p>“Wait a minute,” Feinstein said. “You do that, the whole crowd will head straight for the Residence.”</p>
   <p>“Certainly!” Feckel said. “That‘s the idea! It‘s the only thing to do!”</p>
   <p>“Now look here,” Zwicker said. “We‘re not sending this mob off to attack the Residence compound, women and children . . . . No.”</p>
   <p>“Only to protect the Embassy,” Feckel said quickly. “Our files; we have top secret material—</p>
   <p>“That‘s enough, Barney,” Kerrigan said. “Horace is in charge here.”</p>
   <p>“They‘re starting to work over the limousine now,” Pitts said. “Look.”</p>
   <subtitle>4</subtitle>
   <p>The two Marines posted near the front entrance to the Chancery looked out through the steel grill at the surging mob and the glossy black top of the Embassy Cadillac showing like an island in the sea of faces and waving arms. A man climbed to the hood, jumped up and down. Another joined him. They laughed; another climbed up and danced on the roof. The metal sagged.</p>
   <p>The Marine lying on the floor behind Alice Chan‘s desk looked across at the other.</p>
   <p>“Those guys are gonna louse up the wax job,” he said. “The Ambassador‘s gonna be very unhappy.”</p>
   <p>“I feel for him, but he‘s outa range.”</p>
   <p>The limousine was bouncing loosely now under the assault of five men. Those nearest the car shouted encouragement, reached out to take a crack at window glass, score a gouge in the paint, wrench at the rearview mirror, the cased flags on the fenders, the radio aerial, and other projecting souvenirs. One enterprising fellow stooped, hooked fingers under the fender, and heaved. The car rocked. Others joined him, tugging at random, then calling a beat, rocking in unison. The car swayed, up, up, each surge a little higher. More men joined in.</p>
   <p>“Five bucks they can‘t flip it,” the first Marine called.</p>
   <p>“I‘ll take that; and five more they catch a gook under it when it rolls.”</p>
   <p>The Marines watched. The top tilted toward them, away, back, away; the bottom of the doors showed, then the dusty underside; a roar went up as the heavy car balanced precariously, then went over, crashing to its side, then on, all four wheels in the air, turning leisurely. Screams sounded above the mob.</p>
   <p>“That‘s ten I owe you.”</p>
   <p>“Pay off. In greens; no Kots.”</p>
   <p>Two crumpled five dollar bills fluttered out from behind the desk.</p>
   <p>“I smell gas,” called the first Marine.</p>
   <p>“Sure, the tank‘s upside down.”</p>
   <p>“Hey, duck, boy. I see a bird with a cigar … ”</p>
   <p>“Ten bucks it won‘t blow before dark.”</p>
   <p>“What time is itr</p>
   <p>‘Two thirty.”</p>
   <p>“I‘ll take it.”</p>
   <subtitle>5</subtitle>
   <p>On the river, the after-lunch stillness had settled over the boat.</p>
   <p>“Bert, I have to talk to you. Sit down for five minutes.”</p>
   <p>“Go away; go for a swim.”</p>
   <p>“You shouldn‘t drink so much in the daylight; it shows.”</p>
   <p>“Don‘t start telling me what to do.”</p>
   <p>“You won‘t have to stand it any more, Bert. That‘s what I want to talk about. I‘m leaving you.”</p>
   <p>Bert goggled.</p>
   <p>“Close your mouth; you look idiotic. You don‘t want me; just let me go—</p>
   <p>“You‘re leaving me . . . ?” Bert struggled to sit up. “Listen, let me tell you . . . I want the divorce. You‘re pretty funny, Ruth.<emphasis> You</emphasis> leaving<emphasis> me</emphasis>—</p>
   <p>“That‘s fine. We agree on something at last. All I want is my freedom. You can bring suit if you want to; I‘m not after your precious career.”</p>
   <p>“Well, that‘s very thoughtful, my dear. What grounds do you suggest? Mental cruelty? Eating crackers in bed?”</p>
   <p>“I don‘t care; say what you like—</p>
   <p>“Adultery?”</p>
   <p>“If it will make you any happier.”</p>
   <p>“Ah, but who‘d believe it?” Bert wagged a finger playfully. “Who‘d believe it?”</p>
   <p>“Ask Harvey Throst; he might believe it.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, Harvey might; he‘s about your type … “ The grin faded from Bert‘s face. “Let‘s leave Throst out of this.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, let‘s.”</p>
   <p>“Where does Harvey Throst fit into the picture?”</p>
   <p>“Never mind that—</p>
   <p>“You‘re engaging in middle-aged fancies.” Bert took a swallow from his glass. “What would Throst see in you?”</p>
   <p>“Why don‘t you ask him?”</p>
   <p>“And what would he have to tell me? That he admired you from afar? Or vice versa?”</p>
   <p>“Not so damned far as you might think!” Bert‘s arm jerked, slopping the drink in his hand. ,4What the hell are you trying to get at? What the hell have you been up to while I—</p>
   <p>“While you chased Marie Cummins?”</p>
   <p>“Leave Marie Cummins out of this! She‘s something you wouldn‘t begin to understand—</p>
   <p>‘‘You‘re an eogtistical damned fool, Bert Sutton. What do you think I was doing while you sneaked in and out of Marie Cummins‘ bedroom? Sat home and darned socks? Well, you can bet I didn‘t! You‘re not the only man who‘s not above making love to somebody‘s wife!”</p>
   <p>Bert shoved the glass toward the table, missed. “Made love to whose wife?” His face had turned greenish white. “Who—</p>
   <p>Ruth stood up hastily. “Never mind, Bert. I was just talking. It doesn‘t matter. The point is—</p>
   <p>“Throst? And you? The sneaking, pompous . . . So that‘s how it is! And that‘s what I get for trusting you— Trusting me? Dont make me laugh.</p>
   <p>“I‘ll make you laugh out of the other side of your head before I‘m done with you. You think Throst is pretty fancy, do you? Pretty red-hot as a Casanova—</p>
   <p>“He‘s not bad, compared with you!” Bert swung hard, caught Ruth across the face with an open hand. She recoiled, turned to face him.</p>
   <p>“Get away from me. Bert! I‘m not putting up with a thing from you! Touch me again and I‘ll kill you!”</p>
   <p>“I‘ll do the killing! Throst first, then I‘ll come looking for you, you—</p>
   <p>“You‘re crazy!”</p>
   <p>“Am I? The unwritten law covers this pretty well—</p>
   <p>Two of the plain-clothes men<emphasis>,</emphasis> their hair rumpled from interrupted naps, moved to Bert‘s side. “Please, Mr. Sutton. You are disturbing—</p>
   <p>Bert threw them off. ‘Turn this boat around! I‘m going back!”</p>
   <p>“You‘d better lock him up,” Ruth said. “He‘s gone out of his head.”</p>
   <p>Bert yelled and twisted as they helped him to an empty cabin.</p>
   <p>“Are you all right, Mrs. Sutton?” Bert was pounding on the locked door, howling. Ruth shuddered.</p>
   <p>“Yes, I‘m all right.”</p>
   <subtitle>6</subtitle>
   <p>“What is the disturbance, Captain?” Deputy Prime Minister Chaw demanded.</p>
   <p>“The American gentleman, Honored One; he has drunk too much scotch whiskey; he runs amok. The police gentlemen have locked him in a cabin.”</p>
   <p>“A dreadful noise he is making. I suppose this means the enterprise is a failure, as I expected.”</p>
   <p>“If the Honorable Minister will permit?”</p>
   <p>“Yes?”</p>
   <p>“There is a wireless signal, just received from the city. I have written here … ”</p>
   <p>Chaw looked at the pencilled note.</p>
   <p>“Summon my other guests;” he said, “and make ready to turn back. At once.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, Venerable One. At once … ”</p>
   <p>The police team entered the cabin, bowing.</p>
   <p>“Forget this Sutton,” Chaw said. “I have just been informed of the arrest of the American, Bayard, under a waiver of immunity. Now we can end this farce. Also, there are serious riots in the city. We are turning back at once. And do something to silence the drunken one; drug him if need be. My poor head is aching already.”</p>
   <subtitle>7</subtitle>
   <p>Harvey put the car in reverse, gunned the engine. The tires whined against mud.</p>
   <p>“End of the line,” he said. “We go the rest of the way on foot. How much farther?”</p>
   <p>“Only a little way now, Colonel. We can cut cross the river, and follow along—</p>
   <p>“Let‘s go!”</p>
   <p>Throst followed the Samoyan, pushing through straggly undergrowth in the shadow of the great sour-smelling teak trees. Fairly open ground; they were making good time. No sound of shots yet.</p>
   <p>They emerged on the river bank. The afternoon sun glared on brown water; a quarter of a mile distant, hugging the far bank, the squat-lined State Barge seemed to sit motionless on the river.</p>
   <p>“Are we too late?”</p>
   <p>The guide squinted. “No, Colonel. I see one who walks about aboard the boat. All is yet well.”</p>
   <p>“Where‘s Wmjee?”</p>
   <p>The guide pointed.</p>
   <p>“He will be this way, commanding the channel where it swings to this side.”</p>
   <p>The two moved along the bank. The boat did not appear to move. “When we find him, you disappear,” Throst said.</p>
   <subtitle>8</subtitle>
   <p>A hundred yards distant, behind a screen of bush, General Winjee halted his troops. “Why does the boat stop there?” he asked. “Give me the glasses.” He adjusted the heavy binoculars, steadied them on the boat. It seemed to be coming no closer. Men moved about the deck. The prow was coming about . . .</p>
   <p>“They are turning back!” Winjee barked. “Quickly! We must open fire!”</p>
   <p>“Wait, General!” Captain Khin said. “If the boat is coming about, it will cross to this side, to enter the current. It has kept to the shallows while navigating upstream.”</p>
   <p>“Are you sure of this?”</p>
   <p>“It must!”</p>
   <p>“Very well; hold your fire until we see.” Winjee levelled the glasses again.</p>
   <p>“General! One comes!”</p>
   <p>Winjee whirled. Harvey Throst, mud-spattered and breathing hard, came toward him.</p>
   <p>“Colonel Throst! Here? What … ”</p>
   <p>“Hello, General.”</p>
   <p>“Colonel! This is a military operations area! How—? I am sorry, Colonel. I must ask you to return at once from here! Military—</p>
   <p>“Military horse-feathers. Winjee! I know why you‘re out here. And I‘m telling you it won‘t work!”</p>
   <p>“What is this? Won‘t work? I say it will work!”</p>
   <p>“You‘re not firing on that boat!”</p>
   <p>“I am commanding here, Throst! You are on Samoyan soil now; I give the orders! There will be no white man‘s nonsense!” Behind Winjee, Captain Khin unholstered a pistol, watched Throst.</p>
   <p>“You fire one round at that boat, and 111 blow your whole stinking little scheme wide open! I‘m the one that‘s backing your play with hardware, don‘t forget that!”</p>
   <p>“Your hardware is in the hands of Communists! I am all that stands in the way of a Red take-over!”</p>
   <p>“I don‘t know anything about that! I‘m telling you—dont fire on that boat!</p>
   <p>“You are mad, Harvey! Have you forgotten the plan? With this one— he pointed to the boat—out of the way, my coup is as good as accomplished! And rest assured I will not forget—</p>
   <p>“I said no!”</p>
   <p>Winjee whirled to Captain Khin, pointed at Throst. “Shoot him down!”</p>
   <p>Khin held the pistol at his hip and fired twice, quickly. Throst stumbled back, folded his arms over his stomach and bent double, then fell on his face.</p>
   <p>“I am sorry, Harvey,” Winjee said. He looked at the huddled figure, then turned to Khin.</p>
   <p>“We wait no longer. The shots will warn them. Tell your men to open fire!”</p>
   <p>Captain Khin turned away. Behind Winjee, Harvey Throst moved, dragged the heavy service pistol up, gripping it with both hands. He saw Winjee standing ten feet away. Never thought the little peacock had the guts . . . The pistol was heavy. Safety off. Get it up. God, how it hurts . . . cutting him in two. Mud in the barrel? Hope not. Squeeze . . .</p>
   <p>Winjee seemed to leap, slammed to the ground, a broken doll. The shot echoed, echoed.</p>
   <p>Throst curled around the agony that was eating him, like great steel teeth, chewing . . . Hell of a way to die . . .</p>
   <subtitle>9</subtitle>
   <p>The Ambassador looked at the telephone distastefully, listening to the ring. Perhaps it was good news; maybe the situation had relaxed . . . . He picked it up.</p>
   <p>“Yes?”</p>
   <p>“Mr. Ambassador, Zwicker here. I felt I‘d better call, sir. Things have been happening rather rapidly. I‘ve sent the women out, under protection of some of the Officers; they got through all right—</p>
   <p>“What do you mean, sent the women out? You‘re talking as though there were some major emergency at hand, Zwicker. I‘ll remind you this is not a federal holiday.”</p>
   <p>“It‘s turning into something big, Mr. Ambassador. The mob is running wild. The Cadillac—theyve turned it over—</p>
   <p>“Turned it over!”</p>
   <p>“Yes, and they‘ve smashed out most of the glass on the ground floor and higher up, too. Rocks—</p>
   <p>“That automobile cost the government over three thousand dollars, second-hand, Zwicker! The air conditioning . . . Why, it will be months before another one can be shipped in here! Meanwhile, how am I expected—</p>
   <p>“I‘m sorry, sir. You should see how it is. I mean, it‘s fortunate you can‘t see, er, that you‘re not here at the Chancery. The reason for my call—</p>
   <p>“Look here, Zwicker. I‘ll make the decisions as to where my presence is required. If I had had any idea that you‘d be unequal to the situation . . . But no matter; I‘ve called the Foreign Minister. The police will be along any moment now to clear off the mob.”</p>
   <p>“Sir, they‘re calling for you. The mob, they‘re chanting; they want you to come out. They think you‘re here, in the Chancery. If they learn you‘re not, they may turn to the Residence. I wanted to warn you— Zwickers voice cut off.</p>
   <p>“Yes?” the Ambassador said. “Zwicker … “ The connection was broken. Jiggling availed nothing.</p>
   <p>The Ambassador turned away from the phone, stood mopping at his face. A mob, here? He turned back, gave the operator a number, waited.</p>
   <p>“Ambassador MacWaithe speaking; Macy, I‘m happy that I caught you at home. I should like you to come over to the Residence, if you will; an important matter has arisen. It‘s quite urgent.”</p>
   <subtitle>10</subtitle>
   <p>Macy Nagler, Lt Colonel, USAF walked down the long oriental-carpeted hall of the Residence. The Ambassador awaited him in the drawing room. He came forward extending a hand, thanked him for his promptness. “As I mentioned to you on the telephone, Macy, a very grave situation has arisen, requiring the utmost delicacy in handling.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
   <p>“Macy, is your aircraft in readiness for use? That is, can it be flown at short notice?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, sir, it can.”</p>
   <p>“And your crew?”</p>
   <p>“They‘re at the airport, standing guard over the ship. With these riots, I want to be damn sure nobody gets the idea of monkeying around with it.”</p>
   <p>“A commendable precaution, Macy. There has been no incident, I assume?”</p>
   <p>Nagler shook his head. “No, sir. Captain Stouffer has orders to take off immediately if there‘s any disturbance.”</p>
   <p>“Well, Colonel, I hope nothing hasty has been done! I have . . . ah . . . reluctantly concluded that the seriousness of the situation warrants unusual action.” The Ambassador wiped his forehead again. “I will be ready to depart from here in twenty minutes. You may precede me to the airport, and attend to any formalities.”</p>
   <p>Nagler frowned. “You‘re leaving?”</p>
   <p>“It is necessary that I confer with military authorities at Bangkok, immediately. The situation . . . ah … ”</p>
   <p>“You want me to fly you out? Alone?”</p>
   <p>“No, no, naturally my wife will accompany me. We shall be ready in—</p>
   <p>“I‘ve got a wife, too, Mr. Ambassador.”</p>
   <p>“By all means, bring her along. Don‘t take time to pack anything.”</p>
   <p>“There are several other people with wives, too. And quite a few kids.”</p>
   <p>“Well, Colonel; we can‘t very well take them all!” v</p>
   <p>“Why not? I‘ve got room for fifty-three passengers. I might even crowd a few more in.”</p>
   <p>“Colonel, I‘ve not called you here to debate the matter. You have your instructions!”</p>
   <p>“I can‘t hear you.” Nagler looked sullenly at MacWaithe.</p>
   <p>“Macy; you don‘t understand. That mob; it‘s on its way here, now! It‘s not the others they‘re after, it‘s me! Everyone else is perfectly safe! Don‘t you understand?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, sir. You want me to have the airplane standing by to load all the Embassy dependents. As soon as they‘re all at the airport, I‘ll take off. When they‘re all there.”</p>
   <p>“Macy! I‘ll do what I can, but—</p>
   <p>“I said ALL of them.”</p>
   <p>“Macy, I have great confidence in your tact and discretion. I‘ve taken you into my confidence—this is a confidential matter …</p>
   <p>“I won‘t tell anybody.” Nagler turned and walked out.</p>
   <p>MacWaithe turned and trotted to the kitchen door. “Swami!”</p>
   <p>The head bearer appeared, ducked his head, stood waiting.</p>
   <p>“Swami, I want all the wives and children of the Embassy staff to be notified at once to proceed to the airport! Send out runners to those who have no telephones, and call the others. At once. Haste is vital.”</p>
   <p>Swami hurried away. MacWaithe started to call after him, changed his mind. Surely Nagler couldn‘t expect him to gather USIS and ICA dependents, too . . . .</p>

    <p>Chapter Fourteen</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Standing across the street from the wide lawns surrounding the three-story pink stucco Secretariat, Major Yaw of the Special Team beckoned to his second-in-command, watching yelling rioters move past, headed for the Yankee Embassy six blocks away.</p>
   <p>“Captain, keep on the alert. Shoot into the rabble if they swing this way. If the Communist pigs jump you with OUR weapons, do the best you can; remember, we have trained men; they are a ragged mob.”</p>
   <p>The Captain saluted. Yaw moved off along the walk toward the covered drive leading to the inner court. So far, so good; he had gotten his unit together and thrown a tight cordon around the area, as ordered. No one would go in or out of Government House now without an alarm. Everything was moving according to plan. Winjee would be pleased.</p>
   <p>Ahead, two of the Special Team ambled in unconcerned fashion toward the gallery stair. Beyond, another fanned himself at the foot of the fire escape. Presumably the others were in position according to the time-table. It was almost time now for Step Two.</p>
   <p>The General was an excitable man, but he was a shrewd planner. The coup was so well drilled that even this sudden change in date would affect nothing. The men were ready. Yaw looked at his wrist watch; three-thirty. The time was at hand. He blew his nose on his fingers, took out a handkerchief and cleaned them elaborately, gave the cloth a final flutter, and tucked it away. Then he stepped off briskly toward the shaded drive ahead.</p>

   <p>“The American Ambassador is growing quite excited; perhaps it would be as well to put your chaps on the scene now, Inspector.”</p>
   <p>“I fear that will not be so simple as might be thought, Mr. Minister.”</p>
   <p>“Simple? What do you mean? You have merely to give the order.”</p>
   <p>“Your Excellency has not seen the temper of this mob. They are too near the boil for me to risk my few fellows now. Let them blow off a bit more steam first … ”</p>
   <p>“More steam! At last report they had stoned the building, beaten the Yankee staff, and smashed up the great ugly auto. How much steam do these riff-raff have?”</p>
   <p>“They have had just enough of a taste of blood that they want more. If I interfere now, my men may be stoned. In fact—I—the truth is, Mr. Minister—they may refuse to follow orders.</p>
   <p>“Refuse? Not while I am Minister! I put it in the form of an order, Inspector! Break up this mob, and clear the streets.” The minister looked out the window. “I‘ll be as well pleased when the army is no longer camping round Government House. Finish up this rioting now. They have had their sport!”</p>
   <p>The Inspector shook his head. “I cannot give these orders, Excellency. You may have my resignation.”</p>
   <p>“I accept! I will order them myself. Now get out of my sight!”</p>
   <p>The Inspector shrugged, sighed, and turned toward the hall.</p>
   <subtitle>3</subtitle>
   <p>Major Yaw paused at the top of the stairs. Three of his Special Team men stood at the opposite end of the long gallery. Yaw glanced at his watch. Three thirty-four. He raised a hand, started down the hall. The crew of sweepers dabbing at the drifted litter on the stained tiles eyed him furtively. An evil-looking lot, Yaw thought, overly fleshed for coolie-caste scum. That fellow there: what was that peeping out from under his garment . . . ?</p>
   <p>The sweeper dropped his grass broom, reached under his wrap-around skirt, whipped out a short-bladed dah and aimed a slash at Yaw. Yaw leaped back, saw the blade whistle past the third button on his olive drab blouse; he yanked his Beretta from its holster, fired once at the man, whirled to meet another. He caught a glimpse of his men, running toward him, the sweeper crew scattering, one darting into an office, dah in hand. Yaw fired again, ran toward the office of the Interior Minister. Something had gone wrong, but he must complete his assigned duty . . . .</p>
   <p>He leaped a fallen sweeper, his foot skidded, he went down with a stunning jar . . .</p>
   <p>A sweeper was above him, face twisted, dah sweeping up-</p>
   <p>Major Yaw brought the gun up, shot the man in the face, then scrambled to his feet, slapped ineffectually at the trash clinging to his blood-matted trouser leg. Filthy dogs! But the Minister . . .</p>
   <p>Pistol in hand, Yaw leaped to the office door, looked around. Where was the fat taker-of-bribes? There was a flick of motion behind the filing cabinet. Hiding . . .</p>
   <p>“Behind you!”</p>
   <p>Yaw whirled, shot the sweeper in mid-spring, jumped aside as he fell. Who had called? No matter, there went another. Yaw sprang to the door, sighted carefully down the corridor, and fired. The false sweeper fell against the balustrade, sprawled, clinging to the flowering vines, growing over it. The sun struck across puddled blood, brilliantly scarlet. Yaw fired again. Splendid! Like a target range. One of his men was down. Too bad! He would have to cover that one‘s target, too.</p>
   <p>Yaw stepped back in the shelter of the door, fitted a new clip to his automatic. Better finish off the Minister quickly now, as Winjee had ordered—</p>
   <p>Yaw‘s gun snapped up as a uniformed figure appeared at the door. A policeman—</p>
   <p>“Don‘t shoot!” The man yelped. “The Minister! Is he . . . ?”</p>
   <p>Yaw hesitated; police? How many? Kill them, too. But . . .</p>
   <p>Another policeman appeared at the door. More shots boomed in the gallery. Someooe yelled. Pounding feet, shouts, and more and more police crowding. Too late! he was caught Damnable luck; those sweepers; betrayed? But they would not hang him . . .</p>
   <p>Yaw raised the pistol toward his head. A hand seized him, gripping him, hugging. A fat man, pulling him along . . .</p>
   <p>“I owe you my life, Major! You performed brilliantly, such coolness in the face of those madmen!”</p>
   <p>Yaw pulled free. What? Hands were pumping his, faces beaming, the Minister weeping with joy and telling everyone of his miraculous defense by the brave officer . . . .</p>
   <p>What would Winjee say?</p>
   <subtitle>4</subtitle>
   <p>The Prime Minister sniffed at the perfumed doily screwed up in his hand. His face was pale and damp. He sat behind the desk and looked at the others who talked loudly, all at once, ignoring him.</p>
   <p>“Gentlemen,” he called.</p>
   <p>The police inspector glanced at him, went on talking. Major Yaw shifted in his chair, looked around . . .</p>
   <p>“Yes, Mr. Prime Minister?” he said, loudly.</p>
   <p>“I must have an explanation,” the Prime Minister said, in the sudden silence. “I hear shots, bedlam breaks out in the very halls of the Secretariat; these strange men running about, blood everywhere … “ The old man shuddered. “Is it forgotten that Lord Buddha said—</p>
   <p>“It is all OK now, Honorable Hung,” the Minister of Education said. “The excellent Major and his men were on the spot, and wiped the assassins out to a man.”</p>
   <p>“This killing; Lord Buddha said—</p>
   <p>“How many of your men were injured, Major?”</p>
   <p>“One killed by those scum, two more nicked. And of course, I, myself, but it is only a slight thing, a few stitches—</p>
   <p>“And poor Law-yee; a stray bullet caught him in the eye.”</p>
   <p>“Otherwise, no harm done, eh?”</p>
   <p>“It is a miracle.”</p>
   <p>“Lord Buddha said—</p>
   <p>“No miracle; the army was alert, as always,” the Defense Minister said. “My chaps were on the job—</p>
   <p>A messenger came into the room, ducking his head, went to the Defense Minister.</p>
   <p>“A field despatch from Third Brigade, Honorable.”</p>
   <p>The Minister looked at the typed message, slapped his forehead.</p>
   <p>“Disaster! A tragedy!” he turned to the others. “Gentlemen, General Winjee has given his life in the performance of his duty!”</p>
   <p>A babble broke out, stilled.</p>
   <p>“Also shot was the American military observer—</p>
   <p>“Where?”</p>
   <p>“How did—</p>
   <p>“The message is sent by Captain Khin, General Winjee‘s aide. General Winjee was personally leading a force for the protection of the Deputy Prime Minister‘s boating party against insurgent ambush. In the fighting, he gave his life. Gentlemen, Samoy has lost an honored son.”</p>
   <p>“Then who will now head the Army? Our forces can not be leaderless in the midst of revolution—my cousin, Colonel Koo Chit—</p>
   <p>“Koo Chit! preposterous! My son is senior—</p>
   <p>“Let us not forget that it is my wife‘s brother, Colonel Pang, who now—</p>
   <p>“Gentlemen!” The Prime Minister was standing. He was a very old man. The others fell silent.</p>
   <p>“I am Prime Minister! There will be no wrangling! Lord Buddha said—</p>
   <p>“Yes, yes, but—</p>
   <p>The Prime Minister waited, then droned on. “How many officers of the rank of colonel have we in the army?”</p>
   <p>The Defense Minister counted on his fingers. “Four; and six Lieutenant Colonels. But—</p>
   <p>“And who is senior Major?”</p>
   <p>Major Yaw jumped up. “I have that honor, Venerable Sir!” He bowed.</p>
   <p>“Very well; gentlemen, I am appointing Major Yaw as brevet Colonel, and posting him to command of the armed forces of Samoy pending Parliamentary approval!”</p>
   <p>“Jump him over ten seniors? There will be mutiny!” The Defense Minister waved his arms.</p>
   <p>“Colonel Yaw knows how to deal with mutineers,” the Minister of the Interior said. “Congratulations, Colonel!”</p>
   <p>A round of hand-shaking began.</p>
   <p>“As to the vacated portfolio of Culture,” the Minister said, “my brother-in-law … ”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>“Yaw, your first talk will be the suppression of the rioting in the city. The mobs have now spread out to the British Embassy and the French legation, and others. I have just now had an excited call from the Russian Counsellor; someone has tossed a brick through his office window.”</p>
   <p>“Now the hounds tree their master,” said the Minister of the Interior.</p>
   <p>“I have a report the stolen half-track was seen in the Kogu district, heading toward the center of the city, with a big following including many villagers. Also, looters have opened the manholes and cut out as much copper wire from the new telephone cables as they were able to haul away. And the bronze reliefs from the University are missing.”</p>
   <p>“I will deploy the Third Brigade as soon as they return,” Yaw said, “already the First Brigade is out after these fellows.”</p>
   <p>“Use all the force at your command, Yaw. I am frankly worried now. A little show of spirit before the Yankee Embassy is one thing; it helps the foreigners to remember that there are worse things than neutrality; but when the rabble start shooting at Cabinet Ministers and destroying official property—who knows what may come next?</p>
   <subtitle>5</subtitle>
   <p>. . . the surgeon prodded at my shoulder. “A little sore, eh? But nothing is dislocated.”</p>
   <p>“Say, that‘s great,” I said.</p>
   <p>“Do not blame them; they are poor men with families; they must do their job.”</p>
   <p>“Sure; I‘ll think about their families.”</p>
   <p>“And I advise you; do take the tablets: they win keep you alert, and that will be better than dropping off and having to be awakened.”</p>
   <p>“How long does this go on?”</p>
   <p>“Until you decide to tell them what they want to know; where you have secreted the lakh in good green dollars.” The surgeon laughed. “It is not only the money, but you have made them look like foolish fellows, handing all that cash over to swindlers.”</p>
   <p>“Just until I tell them something I don‘t know; that could be quite a while.”</p>
   <p>“Give it up; you are a reasonable fellow—</p>
   <p>“Are you a doctor, or just another cop?”</p>
   <p>“Think it over, Mr. Bayard.”</p>
   <p>“Hey, how about Lars Lund; you know, my partner in crime?”</p>
   <p>The surgeon frowned. “They should have let me tend him sooner. He will be badly scarred; there is internal damage, too; the ribs, they could not heal so long as—But no matter, I have opened and drained the pockets of infection, and taped the chest, and of course cleaned the wounds. And they have agreed to let him rest tonight; otherwise, it might be very dangerous. I have given him strong sedatives for the pain, and he sleeps now.</p>
   <p>“Is the Embassy doing anything about him yet?”</p>
   <p>“It was a call from the American Counsellor which influenced the Chief Warden to allow me to tend him. But you had better lie down now and rest while you can. They will be along in a few minutes—</p>
   <p>“Listen! What‘s that?”</p>
   <p>The surgeon cocked his head. There was a shot somewhere, and then another, and shouts. The surgeon reached into his bag and brought out a small automatic, backed to the door.</p>
   <p>“Please remain where you are, Mr. Bayard. I will see what this is all about.” He backed out, locked the door, and put the pistol away.</p>
   <p>“Be a good fellow; tell them what they want to know.” He walked away quickly.</p>
   <p>I stood on the chemical toilet, reached out and brushed away the trash and bird droppings from the top of the wall and leaned sideways. I could just see out through the steel-meshed air space under the sheet metal roof. The sun was slanting across the brown dust in the exercise yard. A guard ran across the open space, then two other men who looked like prisoners. A pi dog woke up, moved off. The shouting went on in the distance. There was no more movement in the yard. I climbed down, sat on the wooden stool and waited.</p>
   <subtitle>6</subtitle>
   <p>The released prisoners streamed past, jostling, grinning, joining in the spirit of the occasion to hitch up their skirts and aim a kick with a horny foot at the terrified guards cowering near the broken gate.</p>
   <p>One of the intruders jacked a shell into the chamber of his machine pistol, turned toward a guard.</p>
   <p>“Waste no ammunition on these,” another called. “Little Tiger has ordered it! Come!”</p>
   <p>“Where is the white dog penned?”</p>
   <p>“There!”</p>
   <p>The two insurgent agents ran, dodging around the running prisoners. Inside, a guard jumped up, fled as they darted past him. Which cell? Here . . .</p>
   <p>One man tried a hand-filed key. “No good, the pigs have changed the lock since my last stay. Break the lock!”</p>
   <p>The machine pistol barked. Lars stirred on the dirty blanket as the two pushed into the cell. He grunted as a kick rolled him over.</p>
   <p>“Get up, eater of swill!” Both men seized him, hauled him half upright. “Why does the dog not waken? Faugh! What a stench! He rots! Is he then already dead!”</p>
   <p>“Waken him! We cannot lift this hulk; he will have time to sleep long, as soon as he has told the secret of the hidden dollars!”</p>
   <p>There were shots in the corridor. A guard ran past, skidded, turned, and fell as the machine pistol chattered.</p>
   <p>“Quickly! They rally!”</p>
   <p>“Waken, stinking swine!” The man turned to the other.</p>
   <p>“It is useless; he snores on … ”</p>
   <p>“Let‘s get out!”</p>
   <p>“We must leave this one!”</p>
   <p>The man with the pistol turned, levelled the weapon at Lars‘ head, and squeezed, spattering the wall. The body flopped over.</p>
   <p>“Now the pigs of police at least will not get the loot!” They ran.</p>

   <p>In the front hall at the Embassy Residence, Ambassador MacWaithe clutched at his chest as a man appeared at the open door. “Bradley!” he choked. “Where have you been? I‘ve been frantic— He craned, saw the car under the porte co-chere.</p>
   <p>“Thank God you have a car! Bradley; you must drive me to the airport. Do you know I‘ve been marooned here, isolated? The servants have run away, the telephone is out! The plane may have left without me! It‘s been hours, Bradley! Have you seen the mob? How close—</p>
   <p>Paine put his hand to the side of his head. “Please, Mr. Ambassador! Let us keep calm. I‘m at wit‘s end. The Chancery is surrounded; I was unable to get through. I drove past the Lower Compound on the way here; it was swarming with Samoyans, looting. The houses seemed deserted. What in the name of heaven is going on?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, Bradley, Fve ordered all dependents to the airport. I—naturally, I couldnt go myself until I had seen to the safety of the women and children, but now wed better be getting along; Ill call Sylvia …</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>In the car, Ambassador MacWaithe wiped his forehead.</p>
   <p>“Bradley, if they try to stop us, drive through them! It‘s—its vital that I reach Bangkok and present my personal eyewitness account of the fighting.</p>
   <p>“You‘re sure all the dependents are at the airport, Mr. Ambassador? Perhaps I‘d better swing over past the Upper Compound—</p>
   <p>“No! Direct to the airport, Paine! And perhaps you‘d better drive faster.”</p>
   <p>“I hope they all received notification. I‘m not at all sure what‘s going on myself. Is it so serious?”</p>
   <p>“It‘s utter anarchy! My car has been smashed. American diplomatic personnel have been beaten by the mob! And the police are doing nothing!”</p>
   <p>MacWaithe talked steadily while Paine maneuvered through the last turn and opened up on the straightway toward Kogu Wan aerodrome.</p>
   <subtitle>8</subtitle>
   <p>In the front bedroom at the Number one house in the Upper Embassy Compound, Marie Cummins lay asleep. The yellow light of late afternoon slanted through the windows, coloring the dark teak plank floor. Outside, the sound of shouts and calls ebbed and flowed, interspersed with an occasional crash of breaking glass.</p>
   <p>Marie stirred, sighed heavily. She wore a thin nightgown, and the sheet lay twisted at the foot of the bed. The pillow was damp with perspiration.</p>
   <p>Downstairs, a locked door rattled. Fists pounded, shaking the door in its frame. A rock smashed the glass behind a barred window. Then there was silence again.</p>
   <p>Marie half-opened her eyes. It was late. There were voices outside, disturbing her. A children‘s party, on the lawn. It bothered her. People bothering her, all day; the phone ringing . . . she hadn‘t answered it Didn‘t they understand she wanted to be left alone, wanted to sleep, to get away from all of them? Henry; where was Henry? And why hadn‘t Bradley come back? He said he would. Later she would sleep a little longer. The sleeping pills Bradley gave her had made her so dopey. The children . . . they sounded so loud . . . just go back to sleep . . .</p>
   <subtitle>9</subtitle>
   <p>It was sunset when the State Barge docked at the foot of Mackenzie Street. Standing at the gangway, Chaw motioned to the Captain.</p>
   <p>“Send Mr. Sutton along to his residence by taxicab. He may be sleeping yet, they have given him some kind of injection.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, Honored Sir. The lady has already gone, alone.”</p>
   <p>Chaw looked at the deserted pier, the patrolling soldiers, and beyond, up Mackenzie Street, the black mass of the mob. He could hear the murmur of its roaring over the slop of water against the side of the boat. A black Mercedes started up and crossed the wharf. He sighed, shook his head, and entered the car.</p>
   <p>“To Government House.”</p>
   <subtitle>10</subtitle>
   <p>Bert Sutton grinned crookedly as the door opened. Decided to let him out, had they? About time. Hours in this stinking cabin. Must be quite a wind, the way the tub was rocking. Bert got up and walked unsteadily across to the door, ignoring the Captain, out onto the deck. He stopped, staring at the shabby brick warehouses along Strand Road. What the hell! Docked! Bert felt the shape in his coat pocket Now where was Ruth? He had a little surprise for Ruth . . . .</p>
   <p>The Captain came up to him. “You go to home now,” He said. “I get taxi.”</p>
   <p>Bert turned. “I‘m American dip . . . dip … “ Too hard to say, just for this native. To hell with it. Feeling sea-sick; wish the damn boat would stand still. Those buildings over there going up and down, too; very unpleasant . . .</p>
   <p>Bert rubbed his hands over his face. Wouldn‘t do to come unfed here, in front of this native; ugly little bastard. Fooled the greasers who stuck that damn needle in him. Stayed awake, did a little rummaging. Feeling lousy, though . . .</p>
   <p>Bert went to the gangplank, started across. The Captain took his arm; Bert shook him off.</p>
   <p>“Keep your hooks off my clean suit … ”</p>
   <p>The Captain followed. “You got to take taxi, go to home!”</p>
   <p>“Go where I want to … “ Bert started across the wharf. The Captain followed. “Venerable Chaw say—</p>
   <p>Bert whirled, staggered, steadied himself. He fumbled in his coat pocket, came out with the police revolver he had found in the cabin. He cocked it awkwardly, waved it at the Captain.</p>
   <p>“Beat it, you … ”</p>
   <p>The Captain fled. Bert looked up Mackenzie Street toward the Embassy. Getting dark. Get a car at the Embassy . . . He went on across the wharf.</p>
   <subtitle>11</subtitle>
   <p>Potoke, enjoying a well deserved day off from his duties as Paine Sahib‘s driver, stood close by Little Tiger. All day he had stayed near the Chinaman, observing everything. It had been a good day, filled with sport, Md Potoke had missed nothing. He had managed to place a well-rotted mango squarely in the ear of the Master-wi th-a-face-1 i ke-a-pony when he had come out to join in the play, and one of the shiny knobs from the big car, which he long coveted, nestled now in the pocket of his Embassy issue pants. Surely, this was far better occupation for a man of Potoke‘s abilities than driving the car of Paine Master, though of course he had made plenty of easy kots selling the petrol to wealthy Indians. Now the Day had come, though, the drudgery was finished. Now there would be good fellowship and plenty of looting, and beating of white men, and also other things even more delightful.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Little Tiger moved toward a party worker who had just arrived on the scene. Out of the corner of his eye he noted his self-appointed bodyguard following. A faithful fellow, even if a Samoyan: Potoke was his name. He would remember him, later, if he thought of it.</p>
   <p>Inside the Embassy, the Marine nearest the door called across to the other. “The Chinaman‘s back again, and old Potoke‘s right on his tail.”</p>
   <p>“He must be a big shot with the local Commies. Kind of funny, seeing that dude around every day, and him a Red.”</p>
   <p>“Old Potoke‘s too dumb to come in outa the rain. He can‘t be no kind of a big shot.”</p>
   <p>“He ain‘t no genius, I‘ll give you that. If he lights up again he‘s gonna lose me ten bucks.”</p>
   <p>“Oh-oh, duck! He‘s got a stoogie in his hand—</p>
   <p>Potoke put the cheroot in his mouth, fished for a match in his shirt pocket. As soon as it was dark—Potoke struck the match across his rump—then he would have his chance. Potoke puffed at the white cigar, flipped the match away—</p>
   <p>The sound was like a giant paper bag popped by a mighty palm. Fire darted along the gutters, swept up around the overturned car. Against the roar of flames, thin screams sounded from torches which ran blindly into the crowd, to rebound and fall and scramble up and run . . .</p>
   <p>The tank blew then, a hollow metallic slap, and a fountain of bright blossoms arched out gracefully over the crowd, dropping to stir new vortices of activity which spread and merged, flowing outward. A clear space showed around the burning car, and a few fiery figures humping and bucking on the paving stones against the playful yellow flames, and one, unblackened, spread on his back with the top of his skull gone where the fender skirt had passed.</p>
   <p>The mob was scattering now, men fleeing, the open space before the blazing fire growing, and Little Tiger, hair singed and with a smouldering patch on his jacket, darting, screeching, pulling at sleeves, as his horde melted away before his eyes.</p>
   <p>The steel mesh door across the dark entrance to the Chancery hung slack, broached by the heavy end-panel of the tank, nested now in the crumpled metal slats with its bright chrome cap still in place.</p>
   <p>“That‘s ten you owe me,” the Marine said.</p>
   <subtitle>12</subtitle>
   <p>Bert Sutton made his way along the empty sidewalk. Hard to walk uphill; feet didn‘t seem to be touching the ground. Too much whiskey, and then the needle . . . Ruth and Harvey Throst. Pretty Ruth, that summer in Washington. Throst, the son-of-a-bitch. Where was Ruth? Damned bunch of natives up ahead, a big fire; what‘s burning? Out of the way, what are they yelling about? Marie. A whiny little bitch; where was Ruth? Unfaithful. His girl, proud of her, all the other men envious, she thought he was going places. Harvey, laughing at him. Ruth too. Changed; not like pretty Ruth Carroll, smiling at him, dirty now, with Harvey Throst, West Point, everybody laughing at Bert, Little Bert, the Sutton kid, push him down, all the other kids . . .</p>
   <p>Damn the cruel, strange kids, who hurt and ran away. They stared at him, pointing, running away, and the fire, there‘s a dead man, black as burnt toast, and there‘s the Big Kid; they crowded around, always cruel . . .</p>
   <p>The pistol was in Bert‘s hand and he brought it up, fired, and swung around; they were running, now, afraid . . . . A stone was in front of Bert‘s face; he jerked, felt a blinding glare of darkness, and he turned and ran, staggering around the blazing pyre, leaping the flaming gutter, up on the sidewalk past the flickering reflection in the brass plate, and up the steps into the safe darkness.</p>
   <subtitle>13</subtitle>
   <p>The house was dark in the moonlight as Ruth Sutton turned in the drive, jolted to a stop before the open garage door. Where were the servants? Maybe they‘d run off to join the crowd in the city; another of their damned local festivals, or something. Now she would have to fix her own dinner tonight, of all times. Ruth parked the car and walked around to the front door. Oh, damn that lazy Krishna! He could have at least turned on the security lights, so she could see where she was going. It was a mistake, taking this house out here by itself. In the compound, at least there was some company when you wanted it. What if Bert was still raving when he got home? Would he be crazy enough . . . But Bert was just a big noise; he‘d think of his precious career, and calm down.</p>
   <p>Ruth opened the door and started as someone moved in the gloom. ”</p>
   <p>“Who is it!”</p>
   <p>“Memsah‘b, it is only Krishna.”</p>
   <p>“Krishna! What in the world are you doing here in the dark! Put the lights on.”</p>
   <p>“No, No! Memsah‘b! Bad men coming, see light!”</p>
   <p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
   <p>“All mahster and memsah‘b go to aerodrome now. Many bad fella coming now, all house. Memsah‘b go too, quickly!”</p>
   <p>“Nonsense! Krishna, go along and make dinner now!” Ruth fumbled at the wall, flipped the switch.</p>
   <p>“Lights very bad,” Krishna said, shaking his head.</p>
   <p>“Never mind that! Here‘s the pantry key. I want a brandy-soda.”</p>
   <p>Krishna went into the kitchen. The Memsah‘b was foolish. Where was Sutton Master? Krishna went to the back door, stepped out and stooped to take a heavy dah, used for grass cutting, from its niche under the steps. He had stayed on, for was it not right that if the looters came, he, the servant of the house, should have first pick? But now the memsah‘b was here, and that changed matters. It was too bad . . .</p>
   <p>Krishna hefted the dah. It was a good dah, that. No flattened scrap of flimsy sheet-metal from an oil drum, but a fine heavy blade filed by hand from the spring of a car, with a hilt of tough buffalo horn. It had been long since it had seen proper use, but now, soon . . . He came back into the kitchen, placed the dah by the refrigerator and began mixing the drink for Memsah‘b.</p>

   <p>“I haven‘t seen her, Mr. Paine,” Myra Lewis said. “I was just about the last to leave, and she wasn‘t around.”</p>
   <p>“Did you go to the house, try to rouse someone?”</p>
   <p>“Well, I knocked, but she wouldn‘t be sleeping in the middle of the day.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you, Myra.” Paine turned away. Why had he suggested sedatives yesterday? If Marie were sleeping there now, alone in the deserted compound—</p>
   <p>“Oh, Bradley,” The Ambassador beckoned. He wiped his forehead. “I want you to speak to Macy—</p>
   <p>“I‘ll be back as soon as I can, Mr. Ambassador … ”</p>
   <p>“Back? Where are you going?”</p>
   <p>“Mrs. Cummins; she‘s not here. I think she may have been left behind at the compound. I‘m going to see.”</p>
   <p>“Don‘t be a fool! I forbid it! If the woman saw fit—</p>
   <p>Paine turned toward the entry, the Ambassador‘s voice still shouting after him. Outside, he looked at the cars lining the drive. Lewis‘ Thunderbird was fast, but it would attract too much attention. Jakes‘ Buick, then . . .</p>
   <p>The key was in the ignition. Paine started up, steered around the drive, gunned out onto the road.</p>
   <subtitle>15</subtitle>
   <p>Fools! Little Tiger stopped, chest heaving, throat dry, his scalded cheek bringing tears to his eyes. One moment they fled like leaves before autumn wind, and the next, they raved like fiends—merely because a pig of a Samoyan lay dead with the white mans lead in his teeth! Had not the Leader of All said the Embassy must not be sacked? What did these dogs know of policy! And where were his bodyguards? He must hold them . . . .</p>
   <p>Potoke limped after Little Tiger. How the burning gasoline had seared his poor feet, spoiling the sturdy sneakers he had with such skill stolen from Paine Master. Ai-eee! How the melted rubber had clung to his scorched feet! And now he must tread bare-footed like a coolie over the cobbles and the chips of glass and the still-hot bits from the car. And the Chinaman! Now he went too far, indeed! Driving honest people back from the door, so invitingly open now. Would he then hoard all the loot for himself?</p>
   <p>Little Tiger jumped up on the lowest step, turned, arms spread.</p>
   <p>“Halt, mutinous pigs! It is the order! There will be loot enough for all in the shops and the offices! Stand back!”</p>
   <p>Potoke hobbled across the sidewalk, shying away from the still-flaming car, and stepped up beside him. The hatchet-men of the Chinamen were not about. Good. Potoke stepped behind Little Tiger, put an arm across his throat, and lifted his chin. The Chinaman kicked, clawed at Potoke, but he was a puny fellow for all his big mouth. Potoke grinned out at the staring faces before4iim, showed the knife—a fine, shiny knife, stolen from a Yankee Marine—and with a careful slash, cut the Chinaman‘s throat.</p>

   <p>On the landing, Marine Corporal Leroy levered a round into the chamber of his carbine.</p>
   <p>“OK, Murph, here they come … ”</p>
   <p>“Hey, Lee, did you see old Potoke out there?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah; you reckon that agent had that frog-sticker in his pocket the last time I kicked his butt down the back hall for sleeping on the job?”</p>
   <p>“Sure; but he likes you.”</p>
   <p>There were rapid footsteps behind, coming down the stairs…</p>
   <p>“Hold it you guys! Pull back! No shooting.” Ruggiano jerked a thumb. “Get the lead out! We let ‘em have the place!” Grumbling, the Marine Guards withdrew to the second floor, leaving the entry unguarded.</p>
   <p>“We‘re holing up in the File Room; Zwicker‘s orders,” Ruggiano said. “If they bust through the brick walls, we hide out in the vault.” He prodded LeRoy off down the hall. What the hell was keeping Murph . . .</p>
   <p>Below, Potoke darted into the dark lobby, blinking. Others followed cautiously, crowding in, pulling open the drawers of the reception desk, filling the lobby, spilling off down the corridors. Potoke called out, started up the stairs.</p>
   <p>At the first landing, Murphy stood flattened against the elevator shaft, head cocked, the locking bar from a file safe in his hand. Potoke paused below, saw Ruggiano above, stopped dead; then, grinning, he bounded up the stairs, knife in hand. As he cleared the top, Murphy took a quick step after him, slammed the two-foot length of one-inch steel rod along Potoke‘s skull above the ear. Potoke went down, bounced against the wall, sprawling. Ruggiano stepped to him, caught the body under the arms, and pitched it down the stairs.</p>
   <p>At the File Room door, Ruggiano turned. “Don‘t you hear good, Marine?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, Sarge, but all you said was don‘t shoot You didn‘t say nothing about cold-cocking ‘em.”</p>

   <p>Standing under the strung lanterns at the ICA compound, Fred Chalmers looked at his watch impatiently.</p>
   <p>“Nita, there‘s no question but that the invitations went out in good time, I suppose?”</p>
   <p>“Absolutely, Freddie, I gave them to the dispatcher myself.”</p>
   <p>“This is absurd. Only in Samoy—</p>
   <p>“Oh, Freddie; don‘t feel bad.”</p>
   <p>“Where are the servants? Where is the orchestra? I have fifteen cases of whiskey, five hundred pounds of ice—melting ice! I have a smorgasbord laid for three hundred guests; turkeys, hams, fillet, a hundred kinds of—</p>
   <p>Anita put her arms around Chalmers‘ neck, and her lips over his.</p>
   <p>“There, Freddie, it doesn‘t matter; there‘s this lovely lawn, and a big moon, and we can set up the record player on the terrace, and then there‘ll just be all those turkeys and you . . . and me.”</p>
   <p>“But, after we‘ve spent all day . . . Do you suppose it has anything to do with the disturbance Ali was talking about? The riot or celebration or whatever it was?”</p>
   <p>“I don‘t know, Freddie; who cares?”</p>
   <p>Fred looked at Anita fondly; a vision of loveliness. He would wait no longer; tonight he would propose marriage. Let them boycott his party; he was beyond reach of petty spite now . . .</p>
   <p>“As you say, my dear; who cares?”</p>
   <subtitle>18</subtitle>
   <p>Paine swung the big car through the open gate of the compound, blasted the horn boldly at scattered intruders, and turned in the drive of Number One house. It was dark, silent. Paine got out of the car, looked around; no signs of aggressiveness; these must be casual looters, drawn by the rumor the Americans were abandoning their houses. They were no mob, just foraging individuals. The tide must have passed through and gone on.</p>
   <p>He tried the door; locked. The glass was broken out of the windows above the rhododendron beds, but the bars; no entry there. Perhaps the rear door . . .</p>
   <p>Paine stood in the drive, uncertain. Should he blow the horn, shout? No, it might draw unwanted attention. The windows of the upper storey were unbarred. If he could reach than . . . Wasn‘t there a ladder at the back of each house, along with red-painted buckets, something about fire regulations?</p>
   <p>Paine circled to the back. There was the ladder, mounted against the wall. He made his way between the dusty bushes, lifted the ladder free, and struggled clear with it. Abominably heavy affair; now to set it against the wall. Oh my; two locals watching him. Never mind, get on with it . . . ‘</p>
   <p>Inside the house, Marie sat frozen with terror. They were back again; trying doors, tramping around down there. What would she do? Get a weapon, anything. Hide in the bedroom, with the door locked. Maybe they wouldn‘t bother . . .</p>
   <p>Marie looked around. There was nothing, nothing at all. She‘d better go back out, find something; but they might be In the hall just outside by now. Thank God the baby was with Potu at the Stouffers‘ for the day.</p>
   <p>There was a grating sound from the direction of the upstairs terrace. Horrors! They were climbing up! She was trapped! What could she fight with! The table lamp; it was the only thing . . . Marie crept behind the open terrace door and waited. She could hear a foot grating on the floor now, hoarse breathing . . . She raised the lamp.</p>
   <p>As Bradley Paine stepped through the open door, Marie brought the lamp down shade-first. There was a crash of breaking crockery and Paine stumbled forward, went to his knees. Marie stared, opened her mouth to scream, then—</p>
   <p>“Bradley! Bradley, you came back!”</p>
   <p>Paine, on all fours, looked up at her, blinking.</p>
   <p>“Don Quixote to the rescue,” he murmured.</p>

   <p>At the end of Daijee Street, Brevet-Colonel Yaw stood up in the lorry and studied the scene through opera glasses. Things looked had at the Yankee Embassy. Lights blazed on the lower floor now, and through every window, where broken blinds dangled behind shattered glass, books flew, papers fluttered in a drift that whitened the street. Now a desk tumbled out through the entry, followed by a chair, another, as the front rank ducked and yelled, still pushing toward the door and a fair share of the pickings.</p>
   <p>“Send a company of your men out along Daijee Street and another on MacDougal Street, Lieutenant,” Yaw said. “Then close in along the connecting ways. Squeeze them out of there; let them run away along Mackenzie Street. I want no bother with prisoners; the objective is to relieve the Embassy.”</p>
   <p>The Lieutenant climbed down and started away.</p>
   <p>“Lieutenant! Your battalion is here!” Yaw pointed.</p>
   <p>“I resign my commission, Yaw. I‘m not such a fool as to mix into that nonsense.”</p>
   <p>Yaw jerked his Beretta from its holster.</p>
   <p>“See to your duty, coward, or I shoot you down myself!”</p>
   <p>The Lieutenant turned and looked at the gun.</p>
   <p>“Be a good fellow, Yaw—</p>
   <p>“Colonel Yaw!”</p>
   <p>“We are reasonable men, Colonel Yaw. Why go looking for trouble? If only we wait until morning—</p>
   <p>Yaw fired at the ground near the Lieutenant‘s feet.</p>
   <p>“The next shot is through your heart, killer of flies!”</p>
   <p>“I did but jest,” the Lieutenant said, edging toward his command.</p>
   <p>Yaw bolstered the pistol and sat down, ordered the driver to circle the area. He could pull up at the end of Ponjee Street, which ran alongside the Embassy, and follow the course of the action.</p>
   <p>The lorry maneuvered around the blocked streets, detoured once when it encountered a tentacle of the crowd in Jow Street, and after a ten-minute ride drew up to the spot Yaw directed. All was quiet. Three blocks away, the mob packed black along the side of the besieged building. Papas still floated out of the windows, lending a festive air to the scene.</p>
   <p>Yaw looked at his watch. B Company should be in position along Daijee Street now. Where were they? Yaw waited. Five minutes passed. Yaw heard running feet, leaned out of the cab of the lorry to see three hatless soldiers pelting up from the direction of the Embassy.</p>
   <p>“Stop there!” Yaw yanked at the pistol again. “Stop or I shoot!”</p>
   <p>Two of the three men altered course to cut down an alley; the third, uncertain as to the source of the hail, skidded to a stop.</p>
   <p>“Where are you off to?” Yaw barked.</p>
   <p>Two more men came out of an alley, split, and darted around the lorry. Yaw whirled; the first man jumped for a doorway, disappeared. Yaw fired a round after the running pair, cursed, turned back to his driver.</p>
   <p>“Drive toward the Embassy,” he shouted. “I will see what is happening down there.” Yaw leaned forward, bringing up his opera glasses; then at a sound, turned in time to see his driver disappear up an alley on foot.</p>
   <subtitle>20</subtitle>
   <p>Three blocks east of the Chancery, Georgia Smedley sat at a desk in the USIA Library, listening to the crowd outside.</p>
   <p>Da Nee came up to her, bobbed her head.</p>
   <p>“Mrs. Smedley, please go home now. I think this time they mean mischief.”</p>
   <p>“Why, Da Nee, that‘s just why I must stay! In case some rowdy should try to cause a disturbance, I mean. I‘m sure nobody really wants to damage the library.”</p>
   <p>“I am afraid. They are very many, and now they are becoming drunk. My brother came just now; they have taken the liquor from the Embassy.”</p>
   <p>“They‘ve been stealing from the commissary? How awful! But they all know the library is here to help them.”</p>
   <p>Da Mu came up beside Da Nee. “Please, you must go now, quickly. Take my skirt, and we will put a shawl over your head; then—</p>
   <p>Mrs. Smedley laughed. “Heavens, girls! Flee in disguise! I know you‘re thinking of me, but it‘s silly. The Library will be all right.”</p>
   <subtitle>21</subtitle>
   <p>Larry Ko Yin parked his convertible a block from the library and got out. A devilish noisy lot, but they didn‘t seem violent Just as well to check though, see that Georgia was clear of the place. Pity if the old girl were roughed up, after all the good liquor and hors d‘oeuvres she‘d supplied to culture-minded young chaps like himself. She really was a good sort, for an American; why not do her a good turn now?</p>
   <p>Larry went quietly along the sidewalk, making his way around the coolies who moved about aimlessly, calling out and passing bottles around. The Devil! That was U.S. liquor, Bourbon! They‘d looted the Embassy stores, had they? Curse the no-goods! No more nice parties for a while.</p>
   <p>The windows were lighted dimly, but there was no one in view; probably she had gone hours ago, though her house was empty; still, better have a look. He would cut down the side street and go in at the back—</p>
   <p>An evil-smelling sweeper-caste loafer pushed against him; Larry flung him away. The man reeled drunkenly, came back, shouting. Others looked, gathered. A loud-talking hill man pushed up, waved filthy fingers under his nose—</p>
   <p>“What is it, a half-breed white?”</p>
   <p>“He apes the foreigners!”</p>
   <p>‘Take the white man‘s clothes off him!”</p>
   <p>Larry was jerked back, then sideways. His jacket was ripped down the back, his scarf was snatched away.</p>
   <p>“Here,” he shouted, “I am a Samoyan like yourselves!”</p>
   <p>“A toady of foreign oppressors!”</p>
   <p>“No, no! I am a patriot!”</p>
   <p>Someone spat, and Larry gobbled, wiping his face. “You make a mistake,” he cried. “I am of you! I have come to join in the fun!”</p>
   <p>The circle around him jeered, laughing and slapping at the weeping man. His shirt hung in tatters, and the pockets of his trousers were inside out.</p>
   <p>“Surely, he is an honest sweeper. See the simple rings he wears, worthy of a poor man.”</p>
   <p>Larry pulled off a gold mounted star sapphire and held it out.</p>
   <p>“I give it to thee,” he shouted.</p>
   <p>“He is a fine fellow, see how he strives to please!”</p>
   <p>“The rascal has come to shame us with his finery, the stealer of scraps from the white man‘s table!”</p>
   <p>“No. I come to spit in the faces of the whites! See!”</p>
   <p>Larry stooped, snatched up a brick fragment, and threw it through the library window. He grabbed up another, sent it through a pane of glass; he scrabbled with the others for more missiles, stooping and throwing, until his arm ached, and he fell back, sobbing, and watched the glass splintering, falling, under the shower of stones.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Inside the library, Georgia Smedley ran toward the back of the building. Ahead of her, Da Mu and Da Nee shrieked, came running back. Men crowded in, a table fell with a crash; a grinning man grappled Da Mu, threw her down, screaming. Others trapped Da Nee between the stacks, pulled at her clothes, shotting. She broke away, ran naked across the room, stumbled and was engulfed. Georgia Smedley fell behind a table, crawled toward the front doors. They fell in with a crash, men poured in, a tall bookshelf went over, spilling books across the floor. Books were everywhere, flying through the air; more tables went down, the card catalog dumped, men running and the screams of the women . . .</p>
   <p>Now the first row of stacks teetered, fell, knocking over the next. The impulse traveled across the room, thunderous smash on thunderous smash, and now men screamed from under the wreckage. Georgia came to her feet, ran to the door. There was a man before her, with a bucket—a deluge of choking liquid engulfed her, stifling; gasoline; her eyes .. ,</p>
   <p>She fell, crawled blindly, felt books under her hands; she groped—and a wave of heat struck. Screams, and a stunning blow, feet trampling her . . .</p>
   <p>From the street, the blaze was a stirring spectacle, with frenzied figures silhouetted against the leaping flames, others dropping out of windows. Larry Ko Yin crept into an alley, paying no attention to the good natured kicks aimed his way, and vomited for what seemed like a long time.</p>
   <subtitle>22</subtitle>
   <p>. . . I was sitting in a straight chair in a dark room on the second floor at Police Headquarters with my hands cuffed together to the cross-bar of the chair back. I could barely make out the outline of the hall door. The rest was dark, except for a glowing cigarette in a far corner.</p>
   <p>“Where is the money secreted, Mr. Bayard?” The quiet voice behind me said. There were two other voices, a high squeaky one, and a puffy one, like a fat man, and they always came from behind. Always the same question, too.</p>
   <p>“I‘ll tell you, fellows,” I said. “When I saw the jig was up, I flushed it down the toilet. Now if you‘ll just post a man at the culvert with a strainer—</p>
   <p>“Please do not make jokes, Mr. Bayard. We would all like to have some sleep, yourself included, one assumes, and since you will eventually disclose the information we are seeking, why not now, eh? Be a good fellow now, and tell us where the money is.”</p>
   <p>“Pretty tough on you, not wanting to mark me, isn‘t it, boys?‘ I‘ll bet that cramps your style.”</p>
   <p>“Who knows, Mr. Bayard, Perhaps we will change our minds. Where have you hidden the money?”</p>
   <p>The chair tilted back suddenly, teetered, and I instinctively twisted, straining at the handcuffs. The chair dropped back upright, and I let my breath out. That was a cute trick. You never knew when, or in what direction . . .</p>
   <p>It must be nearly dawn, I thought. This had been going on for a long time.</p>
   <p>“What time is it?”</p>
   <p>“Quarter past two, Mr. Bayard. We have plenty of time, you see. But why not cut it short? A good hot dinner, and a clean bed, and perhaps tomorrow, you are a free man; we hold no grudge, it is merely that the money must be returned first.”</p>
   <p>“I‘ll confess; I don‘t know.”</p>
   <p>“Mr. Lund has told us all, Mr. Bayard. We know your role was the disposal of the cash. Merely tell us … “ said Quiet Voice.</p>
   <p>“Where is the money, Mr. Bayard?” said Squeaky Voice.</p>
   <p>“Where have you hidden the money … “ said Fat Voice.</p>
   <p>‘“Where … ”</p>
   <subtitle>23</subtitle>
   <p>In a basha hut in shanty town, an old woman thrust aside the burlap hanging in the door, crept inside, heaved a sigh. Such a struggle, and for what? A broken paper box containing a sweet powder. She squinted at the carton. C. A. K. No matter, she could not read the foreign symbols. Others who were younger and stronger had made off with the good rice, caring nothing for the needs of age . . .</p>
   <p>She passed into the back chamber of the hut and—</p>
   <p>“Hush! Make no outcry, old woman!”</p>
   <p>She stared at the great muddy form sprawled on the mat, the blood, and—</p>
   <p>“A white! What—</p>
   <p>“Silence, ancient bitch! Do you wish a beating such as you have not had since my father died? This one will bring us wealth.”</p>
   <p>The old woman stared at her son. What madness was this? What if the people knew—</p>
   <p>“He must go,” she hissed. “Out! You will kill us all!”</p>
   <p>“Not so, foolish one! Already he owes me much, and now I protect my investment! Did I not drag him to a village, pay good copper po‘s for a litter, and more for men to drag the Yankee auto free of the mud? Did I not then bring him to the city, in spite of dangers, and—unaided—hide him here? Am I now to lose all?</p>
   <p>“He bleeds much; he will surely die!”</p>
   <p>“I go now for the Indian physician; for your sake, I hope he does not die under your care, old one!”</p>
   <p>He was gone, and the old woman went to stare down at the still figure of Colonel Harvey Throst, then went to the windows to draw the woven bamboo shutters close.</p>

   <p>In the dark upstairs hall of the Embassy, Marine Staff Sergeant Gus Ruggiano moved quietly to the next office, crossed to the window, and looked out Lots of torches out there now, paper all over the street. From here he could see red-striped Top Secret cover sheets among the litter. All that stuff was supposed to be tucked away in the vault with the old ladies. They must have been in a little bit of a hurry.</p>
   <p>Funny the boys outside didn‘t come on up to clean out the upstairs; must have been something about the way old Potoke‘s eye looked hanging down on his cheek with the brains showing, that discouraged them. That Murph was a cut-up, all right.</p>
   <p>Ruggiano ducked as something whistled through the glass-less window and slammed the wall behind him. Close! Have to watch the damned windows from now on. He crossed to the door, and saw the white-wrapped missile on the floor, paper, wrapped around a half a brick . . .</p>
   <p>Ruggiano picked it up, smoothed the crumpled sheet, and held it up to catch the light. After a glance, he went into the hall and made his way hurriedly along toward the File Room.</p>
   <subtitle>25</subtitle>
   <p>“How long we supposed to set in here without food and water?” Pitts asked.</p>
   <p>“We can go out for water—</p>
   <p>“Yeah, now. But when they swamp the upstairs too … ”</p>
   <p>“Why didn‘t we get supplies up from the Commissary, while there was still time?”</p>
   <p>“You didn‘t think of it either.”</p>
   <p>“How‘s Sutton? Still out?”</p>
   <p>“Who cares?”</p>
   <p>“Gentlemen,” Zwicker said. “This can‘t continue much longer; the police will undoubtedly—</p>
   <p>Ruggiano pushed into the room. “Mr. Zwicker, I‘ve got something here … ”</p>
   <p>Zwicker took the paper, took out his glasses and placed them on his nose, and stared at the sheet.</p>
   <p>“Where did you get this, Sergeant?”</p>
   <p>“Somebody tossed it through the window.”</p>
   <p>“What is it?” Pitts said.</p>
   <p>“Why, why, it‘s a message, or purports to be. Certainly nothing official—</p>
   <p>“Let‘s see that,” Feinstein took the sheet, read aloud:</p>
   <p>“His Excellency, the American Ambassador and staff; the undersigned, in capacity as General Secretary of Samoy Free Democratic Party, wishing first to ex—</p>
   <p>“What‘s that?” Pitts interrupted.</p>
   <p>“The SFDP; an unimportant political element,” Zwicker said. “Made up mostly of Anglos and retired civil servants; a reactionary group, vociferously prorwestern, but lacking any real voice—</p>
   <p>“OK,” Feinstein said. “Listen to this— . . . to express deepest regrets at atrocious violation of diplomatic usage by low elements of the Samoyan people. Be assured that these are not true representatives of Samoyan nationals, but are Communist dupes and malcontents only.</p>
   <p>“Our intelligences now unhappily assure us that the temper of this lawless criminal element now grows even worse; indeed, the Embassy must be destroyed if left to rage unabated!” Feinstein paused to look around, then went on.</p>
   <p>“We have therefore formulated the below plan of action in favor of the honor of free democratic Samoyan peoples, in order that murder of friendly diplomatic missions may not be laid at the doorstep of our nation.</p>
   <p>“Promptly at dawn (5:51 A.M. by almanack) the unit of Samoy fencibles will launch diversionary action at left flank of mob, comprising thirty-three individuals mostly of military experience including four former Officers of British Samoyan Constabulary, armed with fire-arms to include twelve Enfields, two Mausers, also hunting rifles of various bore and a number of shotguns.</p>
   <p>“Allowing for one minute‘s time to induce maximum diversion then let American Armed U.S. marine Guard Staff lay down covering fire, under which all civilian staff, estimating at ten persons, also hopefully having guns to hand, shall emerge to make contact with forward element of Samoyan volunteers, making off toward jump-off position for evacuation by lorry.</p>
   <p>“Relying on readily loss of stamina of riff-raff under determined organized strike, and assuring of steadfast compliance to scheme by Samoy Volunteers, I am, sir, respectfully, G.M.B. Howard, Major, BSC, (Ret.)</p>
   <p>P.S. Unfortunately, since impossibility of coordination with your goodselves, pray indulgence to adhere to time-table.</p>
   <p>G.M.B.H”</p>

   <p>“You are certain of this?” the Deputy Prime Minister said.</p>
   <p>“Quite certain, Excellency. The name ‘Cummins‘ was sewn on the inside pocket, which was under the body and thus protected from the fire.”</p>
   <p>“This is a piece of ill luck. And you are sure there were bullet wounds?”</p>
   <p>“A massive—</p>
   <p>“Spare me the details. Chief Inspector! What of the woman? An American also?”</p>
   <p>“Alas, that we cannot tell, so badly charred, your Excellency.”</p>
   <p>Chaw slammed his hands against the table. “I but leave the city for a day, and return to find insurrection, and the Army dithering, a Minister shot, Foreign Embassies under mob attack, the European murdered in his cell, and now an American diplomat dead, shot, incinerated! What capital will they not make of this, in the international press! Our UN delegation will be hissed out of the Chamber!”</p>
   <p>“But, Excellency, we could not help—</p>
   <p>“Precisely! That is the pity of it! We show ourselves unable even to maintain order in our own capital city.”</p>
   <p>“My men—</p>
   <p>“Enough! Now we must set about to make amends as best we can. The American, Bayard, has he given information?”</p>
   <p>“Nothing. Even now the interrogation—</p>
   <p>“Release him! With a clean slate, of course . . . And the Indian, too. I shall compose suitable apologies for our error, and—</p>
   <p>“But, Excellency, with the other dead, the American is our only possibility. Release him, and we can write off one lakh! Besides … “ The police inspector smiled slyly. “It would not be advisable to set him down in these troubled streets tonight. It is nearly midnight; why not wait until morning, when things will perhaps be a little quieter?”</p>
   <p>“Hmmm. Very well, in the morning, at first light.”</p>
   <p>“And while he is our guest, would it not be as well to continue with the interrogation? In very gentlemanly fashion, of course.”</p>
   <p>Chaw glowered at the Inspector.</p>
   <p>“A lakh is a lakh,” the inspector murmured.</p>
   <p>“As you wish, then. But let him be in good health and without bruises! As for the other; suppress this information; better a vanished diplomat than a murdered one.”</p>

   <p>Major George Howard climbed down from the front seat of the delivery van as the horse box lettered Samoy Turf Club drew up behind. He walked back, called to the driver.</p>
   <p>“All ready, Johnnie?”</p>
   <p>“Ready, George. Sorry to be late.”</p>
   <p>“It‘s all right, Johnnie; I allowed a few minutes; but now we have to get cracking.”</p>
   <p>Howard went back to the lead truck, blinked the headlights on dim once, twice, three times, then started up and pulled away from the curb. The streets were empty, and the sound of the motor was startlingly loud. It wouldn‘t be long now; only five blocks to go . . .</p>
   <p>The two trucks moved along at a moderate clip. Up ahead, across Victoria Square, the lights still glaring from the lower window of the Embassy showed up the crowd filling the street, with cooking fires burning here and there. They were quieter now, just before the dawn; a good time to hit them. Maybe it would be a picnic after all.</p>
   <p>Howard slowed at the corner, pulled in among the fringes of the crowd. Nobody was paying much attention, a few shouts, nothing serious. Now to get the lads out quickly, form them up, and before the riff-raff knew what was happening, it would be done.</p>
   <p>Johnnie Lu Yit came up, men behind him.</p>
   <p>“All right, Johnnie, you have your orders!” Howard called out. “Let the beggars know we‘re here!” Had to get the maximum shock value now, before they could gather their wits. The men were jumping down now, forming up in a wide wedge, Howard at the point. As they moved out, a noisy fellow came up to Howard, reached for his rifle. Howard clipped him under the chin with the butt, stepped over him.</p>
   <p>“Close ranks, men! Don‘t be afraid to shoot!”</p>
   <p>There was a shot behind Howard. Lots of noise building up, now. Still plenty dark, but the sky was lighter. Fifty feet into the mob now; they were still giving ground, more curious than anything else . . .</p>
   <p>A yell, and a chap running at him, pushing the others out of the way, nasty looking dah in his hand. Howard threw up the Enfield and fired. That shook them! They were opening up now; more shots behind . . .</p>
   <p>“Don‘t waste your ammunition, lads! And keep it closed up! We don‘t want them in among us!”</p>
   <p>A hundred feet in now; about time for the Americans to open fire. Maybe another three hundred feet to the front of the building; meet them half-way, or a little better, then fall back . . . A piece of cake.</p>
   <p>The shooting was steady now. A stone stung Howard‘s shin, another grazed his forehead. Damnably close packed ahead, not yielding . . . Another one coming at him—Howard worked the bolt, fired, again. Scattered them, by Gemini! Getting close in now. Beastly yell behind. Wasnt one of his fellows; or was it? Lots of stones flying about, poorly aimed. Time for the Americans. What was keeping them? Still alive, surely? Of course; the maurauders hadnt been above the first floor, according to Teddie, and he had spent the day among the beggars . . .</p>
   <p>Howard fired again, paused and stepped back according to the plan worked out the night before to reload. Where the devil was Johnnie? He turned to glance back; the Devil! A perfect sea of blighters all about, Johnnie there, swinging his mauser; why the devil wasn‘t he shooting! And the others! There was a knot of them, surrounded. Why had they let themselves be separated? Better get back, regroup; the Americans would open up any moment now. They bloody well better . . . Howard, still backing, slammed the bolt home in time to fire from the hip at a man leaping at him.</p>

   <p>Ten feet behind the second-story window overlooking the marquee which sheltered the Embassy entrance, Horace Zwicker stood watching the action below, dimly visible in the first light of dawn. The flashes of orange from the guns were less frequent now, and radiated from a shrinking area half across the square. It was suicidal idiocy, and the madmen had asked, expected, those safely inside to venture out among that mob! How they howled! It was like a den of wild beasts . . .</p>
   <p>Sam Pitts pushed past Zwicker, stared out.</p>
   <p>Ruggiano turned from his place near the window.</p>
   <p>“You said they wouldn‘t show, Mr. Zwicker!”</p>
   <p>“Good God! The poor bastards!” Pitts whirled. “We should have taken ‘em up on it. They‘re slaughtering ‘em out there!”</p>
   <p>“I wish to God I‘d of taken my boys out!” Ruggiano growled.</p>
   <p>“You‘re crazy, Ruggiano,” Feckel barked. “Mr. Zwicker saved your bacon. You‘d be murdered alive out there!”</p>
   <p>“Some things better than living too long.”</p>
   <p>“I‘ve told you, Sergeant, it was impossible; unthinkable. This Embassy, killing local people, shooting them down . . . This is a diplomatic Mission. Our relations—</p>
   <p>“Yea! You birds think sucking up to ‘em is the cure for everything, don‘t you? Ever occur to you they might respect us if we showed some guts and stood up to ‘em once in a while?”</p>
   <p>“Our position is unassailable, Sergeant, as long as we give no provocation—</p>
   <p>“Shut up!” Ruggiano yelled, waved his gun. “Get the hell out of my sight before I cut loose on you!”</p>
   <p>The civilians moved back, and Ruggiano fingered his carbine, watching them go.</p>
   <subtitle>3</subtitle>
   <p>Johnnie was down; beggar got him in the back with a filthy dah; all over him now. The Americans; what went wrong? Surely they hadn‘t hung back; after all, they were Englishmen, of a sort. Who ever heard of an English gentleman without the bravery of a lion? It was the message; they had not found it; but he had done his best, as befitted the grandson of a British General . . .</p>
   <p>No chance to make it to the lorries now. Back to back with his loyal lads, reload, fire, fend off the devils, and . . .</p>
   <p>Howard was down, on his back, under a crushing weight, and in his chest a frightful agony . . . . But it faded, and the face above was fading, silent now, only a roaring. Finished, now, and Grandfather, whom I never saw, was I worthy . . . ?</p>
   <subtitle>4</subtitle>
   <p>. . . They had been questioning me all night, the last few hours without getting any answers, not even cute ones. I even dozed a couple of times in spite of the tricks the chair did. Once Fat Voice slapped me across the face hard enough to make one eye water, and I tried to think about his having a family, but it didn‘t help.</p>
   <p>A little grey light was starting to filter past the blinds when three more cops came and snapped on a light and unlocked the cuffs. I looked around, but Quiet Voice and Squeaky Voice were gone. Fat Voice was there; you couldn‘t miss him. The three newcomers had pistols and carried truncheons that looked like they‘d seen a lot of honest use. They invited me to follow them, and I‘m an agreeable cuss so I went along.</p>
   <p>In the front office a round-faced fellow showed me a mouthful of bad teeth and offered me a cigar, an apology and a chair, in that order.</p>
   <p>“No thanks,” I said. “I‘ve tried your chairs. There<emphasis> is </emphasis>one thing you could do though.”</p>
   <p>“Certainly, Mr. Bayard.”</p>
   <p>“Let me have the fat one alone for five minutes.”</p>
   <p>That hurt his feelings and the teeth disappeared, which was OK with me. We kidded around another five minutes while he showed me a couple of forms he thought it would be nice to have my name on, but I told him that with a dislocated shoulder, my writing was so bad I was ashamed of it, and he put the forms away. That seemed to end the formalities, so I headed for the street and nobody stopped me.</p>
   <p>Outside, the sky was just turning pink and I looked at the dirty streets and had the feeling there was something odd that took a minute for me to put a finger on. The city had a dead, deserted look, and it was silent except for a sound like distant surf. I listened, and thought I heard a shot, and then another, but I wasn‘t sure. It didn‘t interest me much. My shoulders ached and I needed sleep; I thought about going home, and then I thought about some things I had to say to a couple of people at the Embassy, and turned to start off in that direction, and then I had another thought, and I knew that all the talking was finished and that nineteen years on Uncle Sam‘s payroll had ended yesterday morning about nine o‘clock.</p>
   <p>Someone moved away from the building across the street and came toward me; it was Tommy Dass, and for once he wasn‘t grinning.</p>
   <p>“You‘re up early, Tommy,” I said.</p>
   <p>“Sir, I been waiting here outside gaol,” he said. “Sir, they are having hot time now at Embassy; you got to go to airport now—</p>
   <p>“Hold on,” I said. “You‘re way ahead of me. I‘m going to bed for about twenty-four hours and what I do after that is anybody‘s guess.”</p>
   <p>“Sir, if they catch you here in street they going to kill you for sure!”</p>
   <p>“Who?” I said. “The cops?”</p>
   <p>“Crazy men at Embassy, smashing up and breaking and throwing writing machines out of window—</p>
   <p>I looked toward the sound of surf. “That?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, sir! All locals run away yesterday morning, and Mr. Hurd and women also run away but maybe four, five inside. I came to tell you because maybe you go back to Embassy—</p>
   <p>“Who‘s inside?”</p>
   <p>“Don‘t know, maybe Mr. Kerrigan and Mr. Pitts and maybe Mr. Zwicker; I don‘t see all who run away.”</p>
   <p>“What about the Marine Guard?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, sure, sir, Marine Guard there, too, but maybe they forgot bullets because they don‘t shoot.”</p>
   <p>“I heard shots a few minutes ago.”</p>
   <p>“Me too, sir. Maybe Marines shooting crazy men now.”</p>
   <p>“What set it off?”</p>
   <p>“Don‘t know, sir.”</p>
   <p>It sounded like my ex-colleagues of the American Embassy had finally gotten themselves in a spot they couldn‘t lie themselves out of.</p>
   <p>“What about the compounds?” I said. “Is all the excitement at the Embassy?”</p>
   <p>“Crazy men all over town, sir, and army chasing, but just getting worse. Big shot in government shot dead, too, and they are robbing shops—</p>
   <p>“Where the hell can I get a car, fast, Tommy?” I was thinking about Ingred, alone in an isolated house. My thoughts were getting worse and worse and I was thinking maybe I ought to quit thinking while I‘m ahead.</p>
   <p>“Plenty cars sitting round, sir,” Tommy said. “I steal one right away.”</p>
   <p>I listened to the sound while Tommy took care of our transportation needs, and thought about the men inside the Embassy, and the Marine Guards who maybe hadn‘t done any shooting; then Tommy pulled up in a sagging Citroen and I took my own advice and quit thinking.</p>
   <p>“Drive toward the Embassy, Tommy,” I said, as I fitted myself in and closed the door. “I want to take a look. Don‘t take any chances, but see how close you can get.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>We pulled off, made an illegal U-turn in front of the police station to show we meant business, and rattled away down Jow Street. When we were in sight of the Embassy a block from the square, I told Dass to pull over, and I took a good look at what was going on. All the windows on the ground floor were lit up, and you could see the remains of window glass and broken blinds. I knew it took a lot of paper to keep an Embassy running, but I never appreciated how much until I saw it spread on the pavement. The burned-out hulk of the Embassy Cadillac was upside down in the middle of the street, and the mob that filled Victoria Square was pushed in close around it and around the building and up the front steps, and they kept up a roar that was stranger and more frightening than anything I had ever heard.</p>
   <p>I sat in the car and looked down the street where the early morning light striking high on the ravaged building fronts gave an illusion of coolness, and I caught myself starting to think again and stopped. To hell with the U.S. Embassy and the clever fellows in it; It was their fortress; not mine—not any more. My nineteen years were over, and I had the future to handle.</p>
   <p>“Tommy,” I said, “let‘s get over to Tamwe Road, the Lund house.”</p>
   <p>“Look, sir!”</p>
   <p>I looked and it was light enough now to see men standing on each other‘s shoulders, reaching up, crawling up over the edge of the heavy marquee that overhung the sidewalk in front of the square white building. The windows up at that level were dark and there was no sign of any movement behind them. There were half a dozen men on the marquee now, and I waited to see them break out the windows and go in, and I thought, they‘ll be barricaded in the File Room now. They‘re OK, unless maybe the boys can get a fire going. It‘s masonry, hard to burn . . .</p>
   <p>Then I saw they weren‘t trying for the windows. They were jumping for the corner of the big garrison flag hanging down dead flat in the still air. One fellow caught and held on with one hand, swinging, then pulled himself up, and another stepped on a bent back and got a handful. The pole projecting from the wall above the third floor windows bent a little, and then there were three, and four riding the big flag before a corner gave and it dropped a foot or two, swinging, and one man fell down into the crowd, but now it was easy to reach and they swarmed up on the red and white stripes, and the tough cloth held until one man made it all the way to the pole, and clung there and sawed with a knife and the cloth parted and fell with the men to the marquee with a thud I could hear above the roar and then the roar swelled, men grabbing at the flag where it dangled down over them, trailing down and disappearing, and then the red stripes raised aloft in strips, red flags waving on dahs and sticks and here and there tied to the barrel of a rifle.</p>
   <p>“Listen, Tommy,” I said. “How the hell do I get into that building?”</p>
   <subtitle>5</subtitle>
   <p>Inside the Embassy Code Room Bert Sutton looked around at the walls just visible in the watery light from the window, blinking at the massed filing cabinets and the haggard men slumped in chairs and on the floor. He sat up, felt a wave of nausea, a throb of pain above the temple.</p>
   <p>“What happened?” he said. His voice cracked, and he cleared it feebly, lay back down.</p>
   <p>Sergeant Ruggiano bent over him.</p>
   <p>“You came through the mob, Mr. Sutton.”</p>
   <p>Bert put a hand up and touched a lump above his eye. Something about a fire; Ruth—</p>
   <p>He sat up. Getting out of this place. Get that damned grinning Throst . . .</p>
   <p>“The File Room,” he said, looking around. “Why am I in the File Room?”</p>
   <p>“Listen,” Ruggiano said.</p>
   <p>Bert sat, mouth open. Listen to what? He would—That sound; a rumble, somebody yelling . . .</p>
   <p>“What is it?”</p>
   <p>“We got kind of unpopular, Mr. Sutton. There‘s a bunch of guys outside that don‘t like Americans. Zwicker thinks this is a good place to sweat ‘em out”</p>
   <p>“But I—why, I get along fine with die locals, I have a thousand friends. Do they know Im here?</p>
   <p>“You had a gun when you came in, Mr. Sutton. Did you use it?”</p>
   <p>“A gun? Me? That‘s fantastic.” Sutton stood up, swaying, started to the door. “What is this, some kind of crazy joke?‘*</p>
   <p>“Better not go out there, Mr. Sutton.”</p>
   <p>Pitts sat up. “Sit down, Bert. You ain‘t going no place.”</p>
   <p>“Let me out of here!”</p>
   <p>“OK, pipe down for Chrissake, Mr. Sutton!” Ruggiano said. “Come on; I‘ll show you. This floor‘s clear.”</p>
   <p>At the front windows, Bert peered out, silent. Broken glass, a rope end dangling from the flag staff, and the mob . . . This was worse than the last demonstration, by a long shot. Had he really walked in here through that? It wasn‘t possible. The last thing he remembered was the boat, then Ruth . . . All right, Ruth, you‘ll be taken care of, after Throst. First Harvey, then Ruth. That damned boat, sick, locked in a room, the needle, and then in the drawer, the gun—</p>
   <p>He<emphasis> had</emphasis> found a gun. Ruggiano said he had a gun when he came in . . . Maybe they weren‘t lying. Must have been really drunk, and that injection . . .</p>
   <p>This was terrible. Trapped in here with these others. He had nothing to do with it, he was out on a boating trip when it happened; what if they broke in here, roughed people up? Dirty little sweepers, touching him, even striking . . .</p>
   <p>Wait a minute! Bert went closer to the glassless opening, looked past the edge of the marquee. It was lighter now, and the man there, by the curb. It was Harry Yung How. Sure it was!</p>
   <p>Bert turned and started for the stairs.</p>
   <p>“Hey, where you going!”</p>
   <p>To hell with Ruggiano, and all the rest of them. Harry was a pal, Bert‘s pal. He‘d get Bert through the crowd, and then . . .</p>
   <p>Ruggiano was leaning over the rail and yelling after him, but let him! Bert shied at Potoke‘s corpse on the landing, ran down the last flight, pushed past two men lounging at the foot of the steps, detoured around the overturned receptionist‘s desk, passed the broken grill—hell of a mess down here, paper all over—and stood on the steps.</p>
   <p>“Harry! Harry Yung How!”</p>
   <p>Bert waved his arms, smiling broadly. They were staring up at him, litter all over the sidewalk, a burnt corpse there, Jesus, look at the Cadillac. Harry, where the hell are you, getting a little nervous, damned impudent natives pushing in, and behind . . .</p>
   <p>Bert turned. Go back? The two at the foot of the steps were standing, looking, and as Bert started toward the stairs they moved to intercept him, big dirty hands out, grinning . . .</p>
   <p>Bert cursed, swung a kick and darted behind the desk, jumped over heaped papers and a smashed typewriter, and fell heavily as a hand caught his leg. He kicked; other hands took him, pulled him upright, propelled him toward the door.</p>
   <p>The yelling was terrible now, and when he got away, when this was over, by God he‘d see this stinking bunch rounded up, jailed for life! And he‘d know the faces, too; that little one with the funny eye, and the other one there and—Tunmong, the Cummins bearer, the lousy turncoat! And where the hell was Harry, Harry had to speak up—Thank God! There he was, not smiling, but coming toward him with two others, pushing through . . .</p>
   <p>“Harry! Tell these monkeys to let go of me! My God, am I glad to see you—</p>
   <p>Harry stepped to Bert, and Bert saw the sweat on the pale face and the look in the coal-black eyes; and the dah swinging up—</p>
   <p>“Harry!”</p>
   <p>It was like a blow from a club, the dull shock, and he was reeling, and Harry swung the crude machete high again, and it wasn‘t real, only a horrible dream, and he and Harry at the Club, having a drink—and Berts fingers found the great deep gash, and he looked down, and the blood . . .</p>
   <p>Harry watched Bert Sutton fall down on the steps. There! He had done it; he had to. Bert Sutton had called his name, cried greetings, and if he had not taken the knife when they offered it, they would have—</p>
   <p>But Sutton was moving, not dead, and how should he, a peaceful man, know aught of killing? But they watched him, and he must strike again . . .</p>
   <p>Harry brought the dah down on Bert‘s head. It was a flimsy weapon, dull, and too light, and Bert crawled now, and Harry sobbed, followed Bert, raising the dah . . . Oh Bert Sutton who were my friend, cling not so to life, for I must surely kill thee . . . .</p>
   <p>They gave ground now, falling back to let the white man crawl, and Harry followed, and the clumsy dah struck, and struck, and Bert went down on his face, and then rolled to his back, and his mouth moved, and Harry looked at Sutton‘s face and Sutton opened his eyes and looked at Harry.</p>
   <p>“Finish . . . it . . . Harry . . . please.”</p>
   <p>Harry stood, the dah fell to the ground, and someone pushed him aside, a merciful one, and opened the white man‘s throat, and then they shouted and leaped about and paid no heed to Harry Yung How making his way like a blind man away along the betel-stained wall toward the shadows.</p>
   <subtitle>6</subtitle>
   <p>. . . we came up the stairs and pushed open the door and we were on the roof of the East Asiatic Company building looking across at the top of the Embassy twenty feet away on the other side of the alley. Tommy went around the shed housing the elevator machinery and dragged a rusty iron ladder toward the low parapet.</p>
   <p>“How the hell did you know about this route in, Tommy?” I asked.</p>
   <p>He almost looked embarrassed. “Few of us locals running little business, sir. Sweepers all time finding little of this and that and sometimes bottle of whiskey sitting little too close behind mesh in commissary, and nobody want to bother Marines, so—</p>
   <p>“I shouldn‘t have asked,” I said. “Will that damned ladder hold me?”</p>
   <p>There was only one way to find out. I went over to the edge and looked down. It was a long drop to the cobbles down below, and the men standing around down there didn‘t look springy enough to help much. I turned back to Tommy.</p>
   <p>“I want you to get out to the Lund house, Tommy. Get the lady and take her to the airport and find Paine. Tell him I said take care of her.” I pulled off my watch.</p>
   <p>“Just a little something to remember me by, Tommy.” I said. “I‘m counting on you.”</p>
   <p>“You bet, sir,” Tommy said. “I take lady and then after, I come back, sir.”</p>
   <p>He was gone, and I went to the ladder and slid it out over the alley and dropped the end on the other side with a sound that I hoped nobody down below would notice and without looking to see I went down on my face and eased out. The ladder gave under me, but I had stopped thinking a long time ago so I went on, keeping flat to distribute the load. I knew my engineering degree would come in handy some day, I thought, and here I am keeping the load distributed to hold the deflection under the elastic limit so there‘ll be stress but no strain and I hope to God the end doesn‘t slip because the ladder is only just long enough . . .</p>
   <p>An explosion racketed between the walls in the narrow alley and I reached for the next rung and pulled and I was halfway now, so I was OK as far as the ladder went, but what about the boy down below with the gun? Another rung, and another, and maybe he only had one round, and then another explosion and the ladder sounded a tone like a tuning fork and rust parr tides stung my face and my hand touched the granite coping and I finished with a lunge and I was on the Chancery roof.</p>
   <p>The ladder looked too inviting sitting there, I thought, and I wished I had a hack-saw handy so I could cut halfway through and replace it, but I didn‘t so I did the next best thing and pulled it free and dropped it and judging from the sounds of annoyance from below I scored.</p>
   <p>I tried the stair-well door and it opened. From the looks of things the party was limited to the ground floor, so I moved on down. The third floor was quiet and orderly, and I headed for the second. Anybody still in the building would be in the File Room which had walls of three inch brick which wasn‘t much, but was better than the plaster partitions of the offices. I eased the second floor door open and edged out into the hall, and the only sound was the mob chant all around like the wind or an earthquake or any other natural disaster. I went down the hall and around past the elevator, walking on the broken glass on the carpet under the windows and down the corridor to the File Room door, and I knocked and yelled and after a minute it opened a crack and Gus Ruggiano and the round eye of a carbine looked out and I went in and he closed up behind me.</p>
   <subtitle>7</subtitle>
   <p>Alone in the house, Ruth Sutton woke just after dawn and lay listening to the crows for a while before she got up and put on a robe and went downstairs. Krishna was standing in the back hall, head cocked. He looked at Ruth with a solemn expression and held up a hand.</p>
   <p>“Bad men coming now,” he said.</p>
   <p>“My God, forget the bad men and get me a cup of coffee.” Ruth turned and went back to the dining room and stood looking out of the window. Down along the road past the open gate there was a dust cloud raised by men who moved across the tiny tilled field behind the wealthy Indian‘s house. Ruth lit a cigarette and watched them. These must be Krishna‘s bad men, she thought. I wonder what‘s up . . . .</p>
   <p>They came slowly along the road now, a big crowd, men darting in among the servants‘ quarters behind the house and others scouting across the fields. They moved steadily toward the gate at the end of the Sutton drive, and Ruth watched and smoked the cigarette, and then turned and went into the kitchen.</p>
   <p>Krishna was standing by the pantry door, with a dah in his hand.</p>
   <p>“Memsah‘b give pantry key,” he said.</p>
   <p>Ruth looked at him and felt icy cold all over. She reached into the pocket of her robe and took out the key and handed it over silently.</p>
   <p>Krishna unlocked the pantry door. “Memsah‘b not have long time now,” he said.</p>
   <p>Krishna reached inside the pantry, put the dah out of sight, then closed and locked the door. “Krishna keep key, Memsah‘b. Memsah‘b take water flask, rice, go to roof now. Stay till bad men go away.”</p>
   <p>Ruth tottered, feeling the blood rush back to her face. “You think . . . they‘ll come here?”</p>
   <p>“Bad men coming<emphasis> now.</emphasis> Quickly, Memsah‘b.”</p>
   <p>Ruth took the basket, turned and went up the stairs to the second floor, Krishna behind her. She crossed the hall, went out onto the terrace, pulled a chair around and stepped up on it, put the basket on the flat overhang of the roof. Krishna stood by the chair, looking up at her.</p>
   <p>“Memsah‘b please to stand on Krishna.”</p>
   <p>Ruth put a slippered foot gingeriy on the little man‘s bony shoulder, leaned over the edge of the roof, pulled herself up. Below, Krishna moved the chair back into place. He looked up at her.</p>
   <p>“Memsah‘b not be worried,” he said. “I bring key back.”</p>
   <p>Ruth took the basket and keeping low, made her way to the shadow of the chimney leading up from the charcoal stove in the kitchen. She lay down on the warm roof and listened to the sounds from below.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>The leader was a squint-eyed hill man, a dog of a Naga, and he scowled as he saw Krishna standing in the door.</p>
   <p>“Welcome, noble brother,” Krishna said, bowing. “Enter this humble place. It is but to ask and poor Krishna will show the place of much silver and many fine silks and machines, too, of the foreigner—</p>
   <p>The hill-man kicked Krishna, pushed past him into the living room.</p>
   <p>“Where is the white-eyed One?” he said. “Where are thy loving masters?”</p>
   <p>“Alas,” Krishna said, smiling and rubbing his leg. “They have fled before thy wrath, noble leader of men. But in their haste they left all for your pleasure, and I, humble Krishna, have stayed, too, that I might serve thee.” Behind him, glass smashed.</p>
   <p>“Where is the woman of the white-eye? Fetch her to me!”</p>
   <p>“Too sad, noble spurner of bribes, but this one, too, has fled, when yet it was dark—</p>
   <p>The hill-man knocked Krishna sprawling with a blow. “You lie, nester in dung-hills! The servants of the Indian saw her come here after the setting of the last sun, nor has she gone again in the fixe cart.”</p>
   <p>Krishna got to his feet, cast an aggrieved smile at the pig of a hill-man, may his sons eat each other . . .</p>
   <p>“So quickly did my lord come that there was no time; they fled on foot, into the bamboo thicket there.”</p>
   <p>The hill-man spat. “Show me the liquor stores, father of fleas, and afterward I will open you up with a knife to see if the truth is in you.”</p>
   <p>“Assuredly, noble patron of the poor; I have longed for the moment when I might show thee what wonders are hid in the liquor shelves.”</p>
   <p>The hill-man bellowed at his followers, thrusting through them, and followed Krishna down the hall, watching as he stopped before a door, fitted the white man‘s talisman to the hidden place, and opened it.</p>
   <p>“But look, noble advisor of head-men, what waits here for thee!”</p>
   <p>The hill-man came up as Krishna half-disappeared behind the door; as he reached out to pull the door wide, it flew back and the dah flashed, and before the hill-man‘s head had stopped rolling, Krishna was across the kitchen, out the door, and gone among the close-set bamboo stalks behind the house.</p>

   <p>. . . There were five civilians and five Marines in the File Room and they had a lot of questions to ask me and I answered some of them and then I asked Ruggiano what he had in the way of guns and ammunition.</p>
   <p>“We got five carbines, and five .38 revolvers, Mr. Bayard,” he said. “And maybe ten rounds apiece—</p>
   <p>“Look here, Bayard,” Zwicker said. “I‘ve given strict instructions as to any use of weapons here—</p>
   <p>“Never mind, Zwicker,” I said. “Tell the Sergeant he‘s to take his orders from me now; I want him to be covered.”</p>
   <p>“Here,” Zwicker said. “You‘re a hot-head, Bayard; I know you, always ready to plunge into matters hastily; I‘ll remind you this is a diplomatic mission, not a commando unit. There‘ll be no shooting.” He turned to Ruggiano. “My instructions stand, Sergeant.”</p>
   <p>“What you diplomats do is your business, Zwicker,” I said. “Just consider me another tourist. An American tourist.”</p>
   <p>“You happen to be a member of the staff of this Embassy, Bayard, however unsuited you may be to that status; and I‘m sure I needn‘t remind you that I am your senior by several grades.”</p>
   <p>“I resigned,” I said. “Early yesterday in the office of the Chief of Mission. I was a little surprised myself when I heard about it.”</p>
   <p>“I suppose you‘re referring to the waiver of immunity,” Zwicker said. “It was decided in the best interests of the Embassy—</p>
   <p>“To hell with the best interests of the Embassy. What‘s the Embassy? A broken-down building full of tired old men. And what are you doing for it, back here in the File Room?”</p>
   <p>“You‘re not in the picture, Bayard,” Feckel said. “Look—</p>
   <p>“What would you have us do, start killing—</p>
   <p>“Don‘t kid me, Zwicker. This building is the territory of the United States. It‘s been invaded. If you want to make it technical, let‘s say the reserves are being called to active duty. Now tell Ruggiano you‘re turning it over to me.”</p>
   <p>Zwicker looked around.</p>
   <p>“Gentlemen,” he said. “Howard, what—</p>
   <p>“No shooting!” Feckel said. “We‘d just be asking for trouble!”</p>
   <p>“Let‘s kick this thing around a little,” Feinstein said.</p>
   <p>“Don‘t you think shooting would merely arouse them?” Kerrigan said tensely.</p>
   <p>“I‘m already aroused,” I said. “Why should I be the only one aroused? Let‘s knock off the debate; tell him, Zwicker.”</p>
   <p>“I wash my hands of it,” Zwicker said. “If there‘s to be shooting I‘ll take no responsibility—</p>
   <p>“Knives,” Pitts said. “A darky‘s scared of a razor—</p>
   <p>“You heard him, Gus,” I said.</p>
   <p>“Yes, sir.” Ruggiano looked around at the other four Marines. “Colonel Bayard‘s in charge now. What he says goes.”</p>
   <p>I told Ruggiano to issue a weapon and ammunition to every man there, and when he finished he and I went out into the hall for a council of war.</p>

   <p>“Sixteen hours now,” yelled Brevet Colonel Yaw, “since the swine of rebels absconded with my beautiful Yankee halftrack! And still they roam unmolested!”</p>
   <p>“But Yaw, we have only now risen from well-earned repose. Scarce have we finished our morning rice—</p>
   <p>“May the natts take thy morning rice! Out after them! Find the half-track and retake it! The loss of face—</p>
   <p>“Oh, it is found, Yaw. Only now the cousin of my wife came bearing my mid-day tiffin—he is a dutiful youth, deserving of reward, possibly a post as—</p>
   <p>“Found where, author of wind!”</p>
   <p>“The cousin of my wife saw the machine in Jow Street, near the place of the silversmiths. A great crowd—</p>
   <p>“In which direction did it proceed? Quickly!”</p>
   <p>“The cousin of my wife—</p>
   <p>“A pest on the cousin of thy wife! Which way?”</p>
   <p>“Alas, he did not say; had I but known—</p>
   <p>“Had thee but throttled in the cord, I should not now be wondering where to ambush the pigs of Red thieves! Silence now while I ponder this!”</p>
   <p>“But Yaw, surely this is a simple matter; to the south along Jow Street lies naught but burnt-out squatters huts and beyond, the paddy fields; but to the north, Victoria Square and—</p>
   <p>“Silence! Wouldst interrupt my deliberations with thy babbling? I was about to say—we proceed at once to outflank the Red dogs at the Yankee Embassy.</p>

   <p>. . . I stood behind the second floor windows and looked down at the street. Ruggiano had told me about Sutton going out, a bad move, because it had gotten them excited again, and now they were whooping it up louder than ever.</p>
   <p>“They‘ll try the stairs pretty soon now, Gus,” I said. “Put two men on the front stairwell and two on the back. Don‘t bar the door back there; it wouldn‘t hold and it will be better to take them as they come up.”</p>
   <p>Ruggiano sent the men off and he and I went on up to the third floor. The glass up there wasn‘t broken, because a Samoyan doesnt have much of a pitching arm I looked out at the flag staff projecting above the windows. “Oh, oh,” I said. “The halyard‘s cut” Ruggiano looked. “Yeah.” I looked at the double-hung windows. “We may have to break that out,” I said. “It‘s been painted shut.”</p>
   <p>We pulled the Chancery guard‘s desk over under the windows and stepped up and worked on the upper sash, but it was set hard. Ruggiano climbed down and I used the butt of the carbine to knock out the glass and the mullions. I handed the carbine down and Ruggiano passed the flag up. It was the fancy one with the gold fringe from the Ambassador‘s office, but it was the best we could do at short notice.</p>
   <p>I stepped up on the cross-bar and ducked under the broken edge of glass and if I ignored the stiffness in my shoulders I could just reach the big mahogany staff. I pushed the folded display flag up and wedged it between the staff and the wall, and turned and looked down at Ruggiano.</p>
   <p>“Pick your targets, Gus,” I said.</p>
   <p>I turned to face the wall, and reached up with both hands and got a grip and pulled up and got a leg over the wood, and started working my way out. The staff was as big around as a man‘s leg above the knee, and it was too damned smooth and big and it was hard to hold on to, but I didn‘t have far to go, only about fifteen feet to where I could grab the cut end of the halyard.</p>
   <p>Below me I heard glass tinkle and then the crack of the carbine. I didn‘t look down to see what Ruggiano was shooting at, and I tried not to think about the target I was making, and I hoped Gus would pay attention to what he was doing and carefully shoot anybody who aimed a rifle at me. I heard the carbine again, and a shot from below almost at the same instant, but I only had a few feet to go now and I concentrated on that. It was easier to travel, out here where the staff was smaller, but it was limber now, and the guy-wire supporting it looked too small for the job, but I thought about the weight of the heavy flag in a high wind, and decided just to worry about being shot. The end of the halyard was slapping me in the face now, and I caught it and held it between my teeth and started back.</p>
   <p>I was getting tired, and the staff was getting bigger and smoother and the dislocated shoulder wasn‘t helping any. I could see ten feet of dirty plaster facade going up to the stone coping, and above that the pale blue sky with clean white clouds and it seemed like a long way back but I reached the wall, and dropped a foot down and felt for the cross-bar and found it. The carbine fired again, twice, and somebody else fired and missed by a foot and plaster chips spattered my face. I threaded the end of the halyard through the grommet in the corner of the flag, and then through the other corner, and found the other end and leaned against the wall and tied it. And then I ducked down to go back through the window and a truck hit me and I flew a long way and hit a brick wall and spread out thin as dust and the dust blew away and it was dark.</p>

   <p>Boke Too, from Guyo Village in the Delta, in town for the excitement, pressed nearer the House of the Foreigners, craning to see what was to happen next, now that the One who climbed like a monkey had fallen down. In his right hand he gripped the glass bottle, emptied of whiskey long ago by some rich lord of a foreigner, but filled now with benzene, and with the cloth tied around the top well greased with fat as the Chinaman had showed. If he, Boke Too, had owned a gun, the climbing One would have fallen the sooner, but no matter; soon now he would reach the open door of the House of Foreigners, and once inside, he would strike a wax match to the greased rag and hurl the whiskey bottle to smash against the wall and when the House was ablaze, then all the foreigners would run out among the people, and there would be much sport. Only a little way now; and what face would not accrue to Boke Too, thinker-up of this admirable plan . . .</p>
   <subtitle>12</subtitle>
   <p>In the front of the mob, Ex-Sergeant Pung, deserter cursed the dogs of Yankees who rose up to shoot guns down into the merry people, gathered here for honest looting and maybe a little well-deserved killing of Foreign dogs! And the One who had clambered out to flaunt the banner of the Yankees over the patriots of Samoy—now he was like to escape, too. If only a man could be sure his well-aimed shot had truly killed the arrogant One; but he had fallen to the marquee, perhaps not even breaking his neck in the fall, and with the murderers above shooting, who was to climb up to see?</p>
   <p>Pung turned to look for volunteers, saw Boke Too pressing forward, and in his hand—</p>
   <p>Pung seized the bottle, wrenched it from the protesting villager, and beat his way through the press to the pavement just under the overhanging marquee. He squatted, took a book of matches from his shirt pocket, nursed a flame alight in the sodden rag. It smoked, blazed up, and Pung rose, bellowed for space, and arced the bottle high in the air, to drop out of sight on the marquee and smash. Pung pushed back, craning. Had the fire-bottle not ignited? But there, a waft of smoke, and more smoke, black, and with orange lights billowing up now. Pung laughed, pointing. Roast, Yankee dog!</p>

   <p>Sam Pitts ran back along the second floor corridor, collided with Mickey Feinstein as the latter stepped from the File Room.</p>
   <p>“That crazy fool‘s gone and got himself killed!” Pitts yelled. He pushed into the room, “Bayard went up and climbed outside; they shot him and he fell down on the overhang!”</p>
   <p>“I told you—hell get us killed, Feckel said. Close the door—</p>
   <p>“All that shooting— Zwicker began.</p>
   <p>“He had the Marines shooting, must have killed a passel of ‘em! They‘re hopping mad now—</p>
   <p>“We‘ll get in the vault, they can‘t—</p>
   <p>“Where‘s Mickey?”</p>
   <p>Feckel picked up the five gallon water bottle that had been taken from the cooler in the hall and staggered with it through the inner vault door. Pitts looked out, down the hall.</p>
   <p>“Where‘d Mickey go?”</p>
   <p>“They‘re right outside; everyone get in here in the vault,” Feckel called from inside the armored chamber.</p>
   <p>“You hold that door, Feckel,” Pitts said. He went out of the File Room and along the hall toward the front of the building. Black smoke was pouring through the open windows. Mickey Feinstein stood in the smoke, a wide figure in a rumpled grey pin-stripe. He ducked down, threw a leg over the window sill, and was gone, out onto the marquee.</p>
   <p>“Mickey, you goddamn fool—</p>
   <p>Pitts yanked the revolver from the leather holster, ran to the window, coughing, and looked out through the smoke. Orange flames whipped up from a growing circle on the tarred surface of the flat overhang. Feinstein was on his knees, bending over Bayard, sprawled with one foot almost touched by the swirl of dancing fire. Rocks thumped to the deck as Feinstein took Bayard‘s arms and started back, scrambling on all fours.</p>
   <p>A bullet whined by Pitts‘ head and he dropped to the floor.</p>
   <p>“Keep your head down, Pitts,” a Marine called.</p>
   <p>Pitts looked around. Two men, lying on the floor, carbines levelled at the stair well . . .</p>
   <p>“Mickey‘s out there! Somebody go help him!”</p>
   <p>“We got to watch the stairs. You better help him yourself.”</p>
   <p>Pitts looked down past the marquee at the angry faces, saw a rifle swinging up . , . He raised the pistol, sighted and fired. Above, a carbine barked.</p>
   <p>“Hurry up, Sam!” Mickey called. “Such a weight—</p>
   <p>Pitts clambered over the sill, took Bayard‘s arm, and together he and Mickey hauled the man to the window, heaved the limp body to the ledge, tumbled it inside. Pitts turned, fired again, and dived through the opening, turned to take Fein-stein‘s arm and pull. They fell together, lay gasping.</p>
   <p>Corporal Leroy turned and looked at the three men on the floor.</p>
   <p>“You clowns did OK.” he said. “Now see if he‘s dead.”</p>
   <subtitle>14</subtitle>
   <p>The memsahT? stood in the doorway with a shotgun pointed at his chest. Tommy Dass grinned.</p>
   <p>“Come quickly—</p>
   <p>“Go away or I will shoot you!” Ingred Lund said.</p>
   <p>“No, please to believe, Madam. Mr. Bayard sending me here to fetch you to the airport. See, here is watch of Mr. Bayard!”</p>
   <p>Ingred looked at the watch. “Perhaps you killed him and took it from him!”</p>
   <p>Tommy Dass covered his mouth courteously to conceal the smile.</p>
   <p>Ingred looked at him.</p>
   <p>“Yes,” she said, lowering the shotgun; “I think I have seen you coming from the Embassy.”</p>
   <p>“Each day, Madam; and now Madam must make haste to come to airport as Mr. Bayard command.”</p>
   <p>“Is it so bad then?”</p>
   <p>“Very bad, Madam. Big bunch of no-goods at U.S. Embassy—breaking, wrecking, burning Cadillac car. Few men still inside; soon they will kill all—</p>
   <p>“You think they will come here, too?”</p>
   <p>“Roving bands looting all European house, Madam. No good to stay here longer. Mr. Bayard say—</p>
   <p>“But I cannot go; Mr. Lund—he …</p>
   <p>“Oh, yes, Madam, knowing Mr. Lund, European gentleman in Samoy gaol.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, I cannot go away while he—</p>
   <p>“Everything OK, Madam,” Tommy Dass said, relieved. “Madam don‘t have to stay longer. Can come quick now.”</p>
   <p>“I won‘t go; please tell Mr. Bayard—</p>
   <p>“Is OK, Madam. Mr. Lund dead now; dead in Samoy gaol.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Time was passing, Tommy Dass thought, and still the white woman wailed; it was but a common thing, death. Time enough for mourning later.</p>
   <p>“Mob coming soon, Madam,” he said. “Please; we got to go now.”</p>
   <p>Ingred stood, dried her eyes, then looked at Tommy Dass.</p>
   <p>“You are certain of this?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, sure, Madam. Embassy messenger knowing all gossip; friend of mine warder at gaol; Mr. Lund dead, all right”</p>
   <p>“You have an auto.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, auto, Madam.”</p>
   <p>“I will go with you. Wait five minutes, please.” Ingred started from the room, turned.</p>
   <p>“You are sure that Mr. Bayard is already at the aerodrome?”</p>
   <p>Tommy Dass looked blank.</p>
   <p>“No, Madam. Mr. Bayard not at airport. Mr. Bayard inside Embassy.”</p>
   <subtitle>15</subtitle>
   <p>. . . I woke up lying on a hard bed that turned out to be the floor of the File Room. My head had been cut off with a dull knife and sewed back on in a hurry, and every bone I owned was broken in four places, especially my left arm. My body felt like an unburied corpse, but it was all I had, so I rolled it over and got it up on its hands and knees. It responded like it belonged to somebody else, and I wished it did. I decided that for the present I wouldn‘t try anything fancy, like standing up.</p>
   <p>“Hey,” somebody said. “He‘s coming around.”</p>
   <p>“I should hope so,” somebody else said. “Look at my suit.”</p>
   <p>“You‘re a doggone hero, Mickey!”</p>
   <p>“Look; don‘t tell anybody; I‘d be ashamed my brother Irving in St. Louis should hear—</p>
   <p>“You got a slug in your back, Colonel. Better take it easy . . . .”</p>
   <p>Somebody was telling me to lie down, and all I could see now were whirling lights, so I thought what the hell, and lay down.</p>
   <p>“Irving‘s got a nice little business; cloaks and suits; with Irving I should be today, in cloaks and suits.”</p>
   <p>“You‘ll get a medal.”</p>
   <p>“All this he goes through—and me, too—he should hang out a piece of dry goods.</p>
   <p>“He done a good thing; ain‘t no bunch of gooks gonna get away with pulling down the American flag.”</p>
   <p>“Me, I‘m a smart guy, I got to go to College and learn economics; so now look at me.”</p>
   <p>“Listen to that; they‘re shooting again.”</p>
   <p>I lay on the floor and listened to the talk. I heard a carbine fire, and I heard footsteps in the hall, and somebody said:</p>
   <p>“Hey, Pitts, What kind of armament that half-track have on it?”</p>
   <p>“Let‘s see; Winjee wanted something special; rocket launchers, I think—</p>
   <p>“I thought so; come take a look; it‘s sitting down at the end of Jow Street, looking right in the front windows.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>I must have passed out again, because the sound woke me up. It rolled and rumbled up and down for a long time, and the air was dusty, and it made me cough, and that hurt, and I sat up and looked around. I could see better now; there was nobody in sight, just the filing cabinets, one of them lying on its side now with plaster from the wall scattered over it and a hole in the brick wall behind it. The door to the vault was closed, and out in the hall I heard a carbine fire.</p>
   <p>I got up and leaned against the wall and thought about it for a while, and then I went over to the door and out into the hall for a look. There was rubble scattered on the carpet, and the air was full of dust, and through it I could see the front windows, looking like a big hole instead of two square ones, because of the sunlight and the dust, and then I got closer and saw it wasn‘t the dust, which was settling now, and I saw somebody moving up ahead, and Ruggiano yelled—</p>
   <p>“Get down!”</p>
   <p>I dropped. Nothing happened, and I started crawling. It was really easier that way, except for the brick fragments.</p>
   <p>Ruggiano crawled up to me.</p>
   <p>“What‘s the shooting?” I said.</p>
   <p>“The big one was a rocket. There‘s a half-track out there—</p>
   <p>“I heard,” I said. “So much for international cooperation.”</p>
   <p>“I think they got troubles getting another rocket in the launcher; they‘re working over it now. The boys downstairs are getting itchy, too. We knocked off two trying the front stairs. I shoved the Ambassador‘s desk down the back stairs to slow ‘em down. I got two of my boys back there, and the other two and four civilians up front.”</p>
   <p>“What do you mean, four?” I said. “Who‘s dead?”</p>
   <p>“Nobody; Feckel holed up in the vault.”</p>
   <p>“Get him out, Gus. We need every man.”</p>
   <p>“He locked the door, Colonel. From the inside. He stays in and we stay out.”</p>
   <p>“OK.” I said, “that simplifies matters. I like the desk trick; roll a couple down the front way, too. Get a few filing cabinets—full ones—out in the hall for cover. Ive got a feeling it wont be long now.</p>
   <subtitle>16</subtitle>
   <p>The two who had been killed on the stairs lay on their backs, eyes open, blood on their faces and much blood on the steps under them. Former Sergeant Pung stood in the doorway and looked up at them, spat, and turned to shout again at the timid ones clustered about. They were a worthless rabble, where there was hot work to be done. First they shrieked and milled about when the truck-that-was-a-tank came into view, then when it shot the whistling bomb into the stronghold of the Ones they rushed yelling to the stairs; and now merely at the sight of a bit of blood, they hung back. How was a man like Pung to accomplish great deeds, if the coolies did not first saturate the foreigners‘ defenses? If only the truck-that-was-a-tank would shoot another great hole in the building, doubtless that would spur them . . .</p>
   <subtitle>17</subtitle>
   <p>Boke Too the villager pushed in vain against the packed backs before him, weeping with frustration. First the pig of a soldier with the broken threads still curling to show where the rank had been stripped from his uniform stole the precious fire bottle which was to make Boke Too a Big Man, only to waste it, spilling it on the roof; and now, with other fortunate ones running in to get first pick of the loot, here he was, pushed aside, fenced out by the close-packed greedy ones in front. If only—</p>
   <p>Boke Too yelped, danced on one foot. Oh, what a cruel pain in the great toe, like a squirrel trap unwarily trod upon! What thing was this! He ducked down, felt on the paving stones, and came up with his trophy. Gazing at it, Boke Too could scarce credit his good fortune. A fine bar of hard iron, with a lovely cluster of sharp things at the end. And heavy! Boke Too caressed the axle shaft, running his fingers over the worn gear at the end. He waved it aloft. Now let the thief of a broken soldier show his face again!</p>
   <subtitle>18</subtitle>
   <p>In the lobby, Pung heard a sound from across the square, and in the next instant a thunderous detonation above. Plaster dropped from the ceiling and the litter on the floor danced and dust rose up. There was a mass roar and Pung leaped back as men rushed the entry, leaping for the stairs, and others, push ing him along now, filling the stairwell, carrying him forward . . . Pung stumbled, regained his feet two steps higher, held to the hand rail, lost his grip, felt himself pushed along, past the body on the stair. Shots from above roared in the stairwell, and a man fell back down as Pung kicked, cursed, and made his way inch by inch back from the murderous trap.</p>
   <p>Above, Ruggiano called out:</p>
   <p>“Pick ‘em off; don‘t waste a shot!”</p>
   <p>Eight men lay on the floor, six behind the barricade of filing cabinets in a semi-circle facing the stair, two covering the blasted window from the shelter of the corridors leading off to either side. Pitts, on the far right, saw a head bob into view and fired; it dropped and another leaped past his line of fire, and Pitts heard Corporal Leroy‘s carbine to his left. Two came together now, bounding up, and Pitts fired, saw one man stop, tottering. The other was past, and guns banged on the left and behind, from the side corridor. They were coming fast, but only twenty feet away, and Pitts hadn‘t had such a good time since they broke up the Klan back in Montgomery County . . .</p>
   <subtitle>19</subtitle>
   <p>Ex-Sergeant Pung fought his way clear of the mainstream and eddied gratefully at one side of the stair. It had been a close thing, but soon now the pigs of foreigners would fall under the feet of the people and cease shooting for all time, after which clever men like himself would find the strong-boxes while the coolies contented themselves with baubles. Pung pushed through those near him to the foot of the stairs where the firing went steadily on, so as to be in position as soon as one might proceed to the treasures above without annoyance, and as he did so, the moving stream surged, milled, and reversed direction. Men with wide eyes and open mouths plunged down from above, arms flailing, and Pung was caught up, carried along, across the lobby, down the steps while he struggled to retain his footing, across the sidewalk, before the pressure slacked and he braced his feet, struck out, and fought his way clear of the fleeing torrent, and turned to look into the face of Boke Too the villager.</p>
   <subtitle>20</subtitle>
   <p>The three Samoyan Army jeeps rounded into Jow Street and skidded to a stop, bracketing the stolen half-track fore and aft. A heavy army lorry rumbled into view from Mac-Dougal Street, pulled up beside them; wiry men in khaki shorts and wool knee socks and flat campaign hats with turned-up brims and the chin straps between their teeth scrambled down, ran for the half-track, where men grabbed for dahs, and stolen rifles, and fell as the 30-30‘s cracked. The driver leaned back in the seat, straining at the starter, and a soldier stepped to the running board, put a pistol against the man‘s chest and fired.</p>
   <p>Brevet-Colonel Yaw jerked open the door on the other side, dragged the body out on the pavement, and clambered into the driver‘s seat.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Inside the Embassy, Ruggiano, on the left of the semi-circle, called:</p>
   <p>“OK, hold your fire! Pitts, see any more of ‘em?”</p>
   <p>Pitts rose up cautiously, came to his knees.</p>
   <p>“Naw! They give up and pulled back!”</p>
   <p>“Did you see him?” Feinstein called. “He was right on top of me already— He rose and looked over the filing cabinet at a big Samoyan stretched on the floor at the top of the stairs.</p>
   <p>“You think that‘s something, look behind you,” Corporal Leroy said. Feinstein jerked to look over his shoulder. Ten feet away a dead man lay half in and half out of the ragged window opening.</p>
   <p>“Look there!” Pitts called. He was crouched, staring out through the broached wall, across the square. “It‘s the Army, they finally got here! They‘er jumping the half-track! It‘s all over!”</p>
   <p>Zwicker put his head up from where he had lain flat on the carpet throughout the shooting. “The army? Of course, thank heaven, I was certain—</p>
   <p>“Doggone! Just when we was getting going good!”</p>
   <p>“They timed it good,” Leroy said. “I got two rounds left.”</p>
   <p>“Look at ‘em run! Wait till the old army drives that track into ‘em!”</p>
   <p>“Now they come,” Feinstein said. “So who needs em?”</p>
   <p>“Hey, wait a minute!”</p>
   <p>Pitts jumped up, ducked back as a rock sailed in to slam against a filing cabinet, then poked his head up far enough to watch the half-track swing a wide U-turn, wheeling up on the sidewalk and lumbering back into the street, and churn away—with dust kicking from the treads, moving off down Jow Street to disappear around a corner.</p>
   <p>“That cuts it, boys.” Pitts said into the silence. “I‘m out of ammo. Next time does it.”</p>
   <subtitle>21</subtitle>
   <p>Ex-Sergeant Pung sat on the sidewalk, groaning. That the madman of a villager should skull him—what was the world coming to, that a reeking goatherd should thus ply a club against a patriot who had merely made use of a fire-bottle not otherwise serving a purpose? Pung explored with his fingers the deep gash across his scalp. How the blood did come! Had he not ducked aside, he would sure have awakened among the natts instead of here in the gutter before the Yankee fort. Fortunate he was that he had not been trampled to death; and what had he missed while his spirit wandered?</p>
   <p>Pung tottered to his feet. There was much running and shouting, and there, across the square, people fled . . .</p>
   <p>“No,” Pung yelled. “Can you flee now, dogs of pigs, when the Yankees still gloat from the windows?” He ran out among those on the edge of the crowd who were starting now to cast anxious eyes toward Jow Street whence the shooting had come, and to edge away, remembering chickens unfed, nets untended, and wives unbeaten this day and night and day again . . .</p>
   <p>“The loot is ours!” Pung yelled. “Now only maybe one Yankee lives. See the great holes made by the whistling bombs! Even devils cannot prevail against heroes like us!”</p>
   <p>A few paused, looking at Pung.</p>
   <p>“One more assault, and the treasure house is ours!” he yelled. He was a fierce figure, dancing there with blood on his face; doubtless he had been among the first, to have taken such a wound; and still he lusted to go again. Perhaps . . .</p>
   <p>Pung exhorted, cursed, ran back and forth, and a nucleus formed, idlers gathered to see, found themselves moving, pulling at others, joining in, growing. One more assault! Let the others go first, then easy looting for all . . . Yes, it was good, and the brave one with the bloody face would lead and doubtless die, but those behind . . .</p>

   <p>Inside, Ruggiano watched the men gathering in the street. Across the square, they were streaming away down Jow Street and Daijee Street, but right out front the die-hards were getting ready.</p>
   <p>Bayard called and Ruggiano went over to where he sat propped against the wall. He didn‘t look good . . .</p>
   <p>“I just had a look out there, Gus. Looks like they‘re good for one more hand.”</p>
   <p>“It looks like it.”</p>
   <p>“How about breaking it up from here?”</p>
   <p>“I figure we got maybe fifteen cartridges left among us. We can‘t lay down much of a barrage with that.”</p>
   <p>“Better call the men in from the back; we‘ll cover the hall from here.”</p>

   <p>Tommy Dass pumped at the pedals of the borrowed cycle-shaw. The white woman was surely mad, but what could one expect from a female taller than a man, with strange blue eyes that a man could not meet and hair like gold threads that was not to be believed had not one seen it? Now, ahead, the sound of bullets shooting and of the crazy men yelling came clear, and still she sat—Tommy Dass stole a glance over his shoulder—calmly, in the shameless dress of pink Chinese silk, holding the foolish silken parasol that would not hold off the monsoon rains as long as it took an honest man to dive into a doorway. Yes, and with her long legs bare for all men to see, but for the filmy covering, and the feet in the pink silk shoes with the little stilts behind that could never negotiate the first mudhole in the bazaar.</p>
   <p>And he, Tommy Dass, a clever fellow; what was he doing here, pulling away like any coolie of a cycle-shaw man, with the sounds of killing growing louder before him, and all the city round ripe for gleaning? Now indeed was the time for a wise man to lay up a store against the lean times ahead when doubtless the police would swarm in their numbers to take revenge against the fools who burned Embassies and murdered Big Shots of the government; but he had said to Bayard Sah‘b that he would return, and that he would see the woman to safety, though why a man like Bayard Sah‘b would take a woman such as this one, when he could have had his pick of dark-eyed Parsee beauties—but the word had been said, and he was no honorless Hindu, but a man and a Muslim, and in any case, what was to be would be . . . .</p>
   <p>Dass turned into MacDougal Street and saw ahead a loose crowd coming into the street from Victoria Square, and behind them more, trotting briskly along with skirts hitched up, scattering out, and still more came . . . .</p>
   <p>Tommy Dass brightened, and pedalled faster. He rolled out into Victoria Square, steering around scattered rubble, and dead bodies, threading through the throng moving away from the Embassy which looked deserted now, with a great hole in the front and above the hole the flag staff with a little flag flapping its gold fringe, and smoke curling up from the marquee, and another hole high up, not so large—</p>
   <p>Tommy Dass saw the knot of men at the entrance, maybe fifty—no, more like a hundred; there was a rifle waving, and another . . . He was in the open now, pedalling steadily toward the fist-shaking ones. One or two were turning to look at him, and it was too late to turn back; he could only go on, and what was the mad woman thinking now with her bare legs and her pink parasol?</p>
   <subtitle>22</subtitle>
   <p>. . . I sat on the floor leaning against the wall and listened to them talk through the humming in my head. “What are we going to do?” Kerrigan said. “We‘ll never stand off another rush—</p>
   <p>“A white flag; a flag of truce,” Zwicker said. “We must parley—</p>
   <p>“If I took Irving‘s advice, I‘m in St. Louis now—</p>
   <p>“Lord God in the morning!” Pitts yelled. “Lookit here what‘s coming!”</p>
   <p>I made it to my feet stiffly, looked out, the others crowding . . .</p>
   <p>“Ruggiano, you and your men cover her!” I said. “The rest of you—cover the stairs. Gus, dont shoot until you have to, and dont miss …</p>
   <p>I propped myself against the wall, levelled my carbine at the noisemaker in the front rank of the men clustered in the street, and waited.</p>
   <subtitle>23</subtitle>
   <p>“Those with guns, to the front!” Pung was calling. “Charge up the stairs by twos, firing the while, and falter not—</p>
   <p>Pung saw the face then, not ten feet away; the ugjy grin of the feeder of pigs who had thought to brain him . . . He jerked up the Mauser, worked the bolt, threw the weapon to his shoulder and pulled the trigger.</p>
   <p>There was a click! and then the peasant was upon him—</p>
   <p>Pung leaped back, clubbed the rifle, swung at the head of Boke Too, who ducked, gripping the axle with both hands, and moved in. The group spread, forming the immemorial circle . . .</p>
   <p>‘Two kot on the one with the goat-dung in his hair,” cried one.</p>
   <p>“Done; the dog of a deserter is the angrier.”</p>
   <p>“But see the fine swing of the barefoot one ..</p>
   <p>“I hazard five the angry one draws first blood!”</p>
   <p>Pung ducked, jumped in and laid the rifle across the back of Boke Too as he spun away. The wood splintered, and Boke Too came back, laughing.</p>
   <p>“One kiss from the iron club—</p>
   <p>“The soldier is bigger—</p>
   <p>There was a tinkle of a bicycle bell, and a man looked up, surprised, stepped aside, craning to follow the action, as the cycle-shaw glided into the loose circle. The bell tinkled again, and Boke Too stared, dodged back, mouth open, lowering the club, following with his eyes ..</p>
   <p>Pung howled, leaped after the cycle-shaw and swung the broken rifle high over the head of the white bitch—</p>
   <p>Behind him, Boke Too spat on his hands, rubbed them together, gripped the axle, took two quick steps and brought the spurred bar around in a flat arc that sent the thief of fire-bottles skidding face down on the cobbles, and set three spectators to slapping angrily at their skirts while the others laughed, drifting away.</p>
   <p>“Foul!” cried one. “My man was not looking—</p>
   <p>“The worse for him! Pay up!”</p>
   <p>At the curb, Tommy Dass jumped down, waiting while the mad woman closed the parasol and stepped down. He followed her around the headless body before the door, up the steps, and inside. Then at last she sobbed like a woman and ran, Tommy Dass crowding her heels on the stair, and thinking that though he was in truth a man and a Muslim, it was well she had long legs, else she had come in a poor second . . . .</p>

   <p>Sam Pitts stood on the charred marquee smoking a long square cigar and watching the activity below. A squad of busy-looking policemen prodded a few complaining loiterers along the sidewalk, some of them Sammy‘s regulars, back on the job already. Zwicker and two Marines were poking around in the papers on the ground, picking up classified material. There was nobody else in sight, just the fire-rusty hulk of the Cadillac and a couple of dead bodies in the street and more scattered across Victoria Square, and an empty cycle-shaw standing at the curb. It had been quite a fracas while it lasted, but it was like he always said, Sam thought; a darky never could stand up to gunfire.</p>
   <p>He looked across the square at the huddled figures on the ground. Except for<emphasis> that</emphasis> crazy bunch, he thought; the SFDP or whatever they called themselves. But they didn‘t count; they were an exception.</p>
   <p>Sam went through the opening back into the hall. Bayard looked comfortable, with his head in the lap of the blonde. That pink really did things for her. Just like a fool woman, walking in here like she did. Broke up the party, though. There was still a lot of hammering back in the back where Ruggiano was working on the vault door. Pitts looked at his watch. About time for lunch. No cars down there; probably have to walk. The food wasn‘t as good at the Samoy Royal, but it was closer. Sam went down the stairs and out past a stripped, headless body at the curb, and away along the street.</p>

   <p>At Government House, the Interior Minister looked over his glasses at the Inspector of Police.</p>
   <p>“The Indian, Dasgupta; he was released this morning together with the American?”</p>
   <p>“Assuredly, Excellency. Just as you ordered—</p>
   <p>“It was<emphasis> you</emphasis> who said he knew nothing! but no matter. A telegram has arrived for you. I took the liberty of perusing it.” He passed it over. “From the Police of Calcutta.” The inspector read:</p>
   <p>“Sum of dollars one hundred and four thousand in U.S. notes deposited account V. S. B. Dasgupta Chartered Bank of India tenth instant stop connection with recent fund conversion affair query unfortunately no possibility attachment account.</p>
   <p>Ameen.”</p>
   <p>“Has—he—?</p>
   <p>“At seven twenty A. M. via Swissaire for Geneva.”</p>
   <p>“Hum,” said the Minister. “Yes,” said the inspector.</p>

   <p>The Embassy sedan moved off along the palm-lined drive of the Tamwe Nursing Home, and Howard Kerrigan leaned back with a sigh. Throst was mending, and certainly didn‘t lack for attention, though perhaps there was something a little . . . indelicate? about the way Ruth Sutton hovered over the man. But probably playing nurse was a compensation, after the loss of Bert. Poor Bert. What had possessed him to run out into the arms of the mob as he had? He had been raving drunk when he came in; he must have been still under the influence. The funeral had been a dismal affair, with the remains—what had been found of them—sealed in a closed box. The grief of Berts Chinese friend, Harry Whats-his-name, had been touching; the poor chap actually wept as he placed a wreath on the casket. Perhaps Bert had had hidden qualities.</p>
   <p>As for Harvey, it would be interesting to know just what he had been about when he was shot—somewhere out in the bush, from what had been said. Well, no doubt that was some sort of military secret. And young Cummins; there was a secret indeed. What had become of him? The kin had been notified, of course, and the legal declaration . . . But it was strange, to drop from sight like that. Frightening . . .</p>
   <p>Kerrigan shifted, looked out at the grey water of the lake. What a shocking thing it had been. Poor Barney Feckel, suffocated in the vault. A ghastly death. And to think that he, and Zwicker, too, had come within an ace of sharing it. Why had they held back when Barney warned them he was about to shut the door? Had it been a sort of premonition that a shell fragment would shatter the combination lock, and that hours would pass before the door was opened? But that was nonsense, of course.</p>
   <p>The Embassy routine seemed even grimmer than usual, lately. One could well envy Brad Paine, off for home and retirement. But there were worse things than the daily monotony. Think of poor Bayard, out on the street, on his own now, and after he had been fully cleared of the Lund business, offered the opportunity to stay on . . . Unfortunate fellow; a capable man, but clearly out of place in the Foreign Service. Perhaps it was for the best.</p>
   <p>Kerrigan rode along, looking out at the lowering sky that preceded the monsoon rains. A gloomy place, Samoy. Bad enough in the summer, with the abominable heat, but now the rains would come, the clammy air, and the green mould growing on shoes and camera cases, and the mud . . . Yes, it was cold outside, even in the tropics, when the rain fell. It would be good to get to the Embassy, into the comfortable, secure office. It would be nice to stay there, never venture out into the mud, and the hardships; but they were there, always waiting. All a man could do was absorb himself in his work, and forget about it, and it was almost as though it wasn‘t there at all.</p>

   <p>His Excellency Ambassador Arlington Fitch MacWaithe looked at his handsome silver pocket watch, compared it with the electric clock on the wall, and returned it to a vest pocket. Only a few minutes more. A great occasion, this. Commendations from the Department to be read aloud, including his own. Quite impossible to read that one himself, of course; perhaps Kerrigan; yes, Howard had a nice way with a well-rounded period.</p>
   <p>MacWaithe picked up the long despatch and looked at it again, frowning gravely. A pity so many were mentioned here; it tended to distract somewhat from the really important contributions. He read over the paragraphs devoted to himself, fondly . . . .</p>
   <p>“—especially commended . . . firmness, decision, and judgment . . . First evacuating dependent personnel . . . Attache aircraft in readiness . . . wisdom and forethought . . . picked group of Embassy officers to reinforce Marine Guard . . . though prevented by mob action from joining . . . maintained telephone contact . . . official channels . . . repaired to airport to encourage Embassy personnel only after . . . held firm . . . successful conclusion . . . reaffirmation of tradition . . . duty . . . solemn pride … ”</p>
   <p>MacWaithe sighed. Surely, after this, a civilized post. Why not Paris or London? Or better, Brussels; less responsibility. Perhaps, later, there would be a place for a man of proven ability at Under-Secretary level—or even higher.</p>
   <p>MacWaithe glanced down the sheet. Much shorter bit on Paine; rightly so, of course. “—concern for welfare of dependents . . . jeopardy . . . personally toured . . . obstacles . . . example of selfless courage.</p>
   <p>A bit thick, of course, but Paine was retired now; no harm in it. This on Zwicker, now. Really, the Department should consider the effect of too fulsome praise on less seasoned officers. After all, he had been acting under instructions . . .</p>
   <p>And even a mention of the fellow Bayard, his gesture in displaying the colors shortly before relief by police . . . Hardly appropriate, bringing that unfortunate person to one‘s attention again, in such a context.</p>
   <p>MacWaithe placed the despatch on the desk, gently. He had come through handsomely, after all. He was in favor now in the Department and here in Samoy, too. How touching, the heartwarming tribute from the simple people of Samoy, the expressions of affection, respect, of regret at the unhappy incident. MacWaithe ran his eyes over the display on the rosewood table at the other side of the room. The hammered silver work, the ivory, so delicately carved, the lacquer-ware—inferior to Chinese work, of course, but still worth money—the figurines in rich wood and the antique marble buddha. Simple gifts from the heart. Yes, even the grisly trophy there at the top, the ghastly shrunken human head. In the worst of taste, displaying that, one might say; but to a more perceptive eye, might not this primitive offering, this blackened face twisted into a perpetual smile, symbolize the challenge of the Foreign Service in meeting, as a wise and beneficent elder brother, with the less fortunate peoples of the under-developed—or rather, emergent—nations? Indeed, after the brief, childish violence, this token was fitting; perhaps of all the gifts laid before him, this one best served as a reminder of the real feeling; the true deep feeling for Americans, here in this simple land.</p>
   <p>Ambassador MacWaithe leaned back, hands clasped across his stomach, and smiled at the tiny face; and across the room, Bert Sutton smiled back . . .</p>

   <p>. . . We took a table by the railing on the terrace, and I hung the cane on the empty chair and sat down.</p>
   <p>“Tomorrow,” I said, “I‘m going to throw the cane away and buy a bicycle.”</p>
   <p>“Two more weeks, Alskade,” Ingred said.<emphasis> “Then</emphasis> you can throw it away and we will both buy a bicycle.”</p>
   <p>I looked out past the distant line of Stockholm‘s roof-tops and chimney-pots across the bay at the luminous twilight sky beyond.</p>
   <p>“What time did you say it is?”</p>
   <p>Ingred looked at her wrist.</p>
   <p>“Five minutes before midnight.”</p>
   <p>“This midnight sun,” I said. “It‘s a great idea for people who want to sit outside and drink all night.”</p>
   <p>“It is good for anything you want to do all night, darling.”</p>
   <p>I put my hand over Ingred‘s.</p>
   <p>“You know what I‘m going to buy you, just as soon as somebody decides to hire a young engineer just starting out?”</p>
   <p>“What?”</p>
   <p>“A microscope, so you can see the diamond.”</p>
   <p>“I don‘t have to see it; I know it‘s there.”</p>
   <p>The waiter came then, and poured white wine into thin glasses. I picked mine up and looked at Ingred, and we touched glasses.</p>
   <p>“Here‘s to the next nineteen years.”</p>
