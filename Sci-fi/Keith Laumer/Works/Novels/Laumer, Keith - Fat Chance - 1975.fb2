    <p>Chapter 1</p>
   </title>
   <p>I guess it was dinnertime because the smell of hot grease was floating up from the kitchen of the Maxwell House Hotel across the alley. I wasn’t working, just resting my ankles on the corner of my desk and wondering why I’d ever bought a pair of purple Argyles with lemon-yellow clocks; but the intellectual challenge was too much for me. I yawned and the buzzer sounded from the spare office I call my reception room. That told me somebody had opened the hall door. I finished off the yawn and was thinking about getting my feet off the desk and the alert, confident look of an efficient private investigator on my face when suddenly somebody was standing in the connecting doorway. His body was broad enough to almost fill it, which made him look shorter than he was, until you noticed he had to duck a little coming through. His face was broad and scarred, with the faded tan of an ex-outdoor man; he had short gray hair that lay flat on a round, hard-looking skull. His shoulders looked like the abutments for Boulder Dam. Anyway, he had wide shoulders. He looked like a circus strong man in town to visit his grandchildren.</p>
   <p>His little, pale blue eyes roamed around the room, came back to rest on me. He came on into the room, hooked the guest chair around and sat in it carefully, as if he’d had a chair break under him once and wasn’t risking a repeat. All this made about as much noise as a bare foot on a bath mat.</p>
   <p>“I’m Lou Anglich,” he said, in a rumble that came from down around his shoes. He said it as if it was information I’d been waiting for, and would be glad to get. “You’re Shaw, huh?”</p>
   <p>I nodded. “You move pretty well, Mr. Anglich,” I said. “But why waste it on me?”</p>
   <p>“You don’t get me, Shaw. A fellow named Lacey in the sheriff’s office sent me. I maybe got a job for you.” He looked around the room again, carefully, frowning at the near-walnut chairs, the rust-red carpet, the old calendar with Rembrandt on it, the back of my name on the glass door.</p>
   <p>“You must have dough, the front you put up,” he said. He was wearing the kind of sport coat a lumberjack would go to the state fair in. He put a big hand inside it and lifted out a well-fed wallet. He tore it open and grabbed money from it, jammed the wallet back in a side pocket, poked through the bills and picked out the ones he liked. They were hundreds. I liked them too. He reached across and shoved a few of them under the pen set on the desk.</p>
   <p>He leaned back and flashed some gold crowns at me.</p>
   <p>“Dough is no problem,” he said. “Maybe you know me better now, huh?”</p>
   <p>I put my hands back of my head and looked at the water stains on the ceiling.</p>
   <p>“Anglich, Lou or Louis,” I said. “Former Tampa stevedore, deck hand, union enforcer. You operated a rum and guns service in and out of Cuba for a while, until the Coast Guard closed it down. You switched to bolita, ran up a tidy stake, came West. Bought real estate in the right places, made money. Hungarian ancestry, no family. No police record since Tampa.”</p>
   <p>“Geeze,” he said. “I pretty near forgot about the bolita myself.”</p>
   <p>“You said Lacey sent you. What did he think we might have in common?”</p>
   <p>His little eyes pinched down, looked speculative. “I kind of expected a bigger layout. If you’re so good, why you operate out of this mousetrap?”</p>
   <p>“I’ve wondered about that myself. I think Lacey gave you a bum steer.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe a cheapie is what I want, at that.” He shifted in the chair. The chair creaked. “A cheapie that can keep his yap buttoned.”</p>
   <p>“There’s another thing,” I said. “I have a somewhat restricted clientele.”</p>
   <p>“Huh?” He creaked the chair again. “I can pay my way, you seen that.”</p>
   <p>“You’ve got your own kind of connections, Mr. Anglich. I’m not sure we’d get along.”</p>
   <p>His forehead narrowed down to an inch wide; he opened his mouth to scare me and then changed his tack. He shifted around in the chair and grinned an almost shy grin.</p>
   <p>“Look, guy, I been out of the rackets twenty years. That dough’s as clean as church bingo.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe cleaner. I still don’t think I’m the man to earn it.”</p>
   <p>Anglich nodded as if I was finally seeing it his way. “Swell,” he said. “You got principles. Nice, if you can afford ‘em. Me, I come up the hard way. Maybe I cut a few corners on the way. But you think Lacey would of steered me to you if I was still working that side of the street?”</p>
   <p>“I hope not.”</p>
   <p>“I get it. The widows’ and orphans’ pal. But a guy which maybe he ain’t had all the breaks―toss him out on his can. Even if he’s a father.”</p>
   <p>It was a pretty funny line coming from who it came from, but he wasn’t smiling. Something hunted peeped out of the little pale eyes just for a moment, and went away again.</p>
   <p>“I guess I slipped on that one,” I said.</p>
   <p>He got out the wallet again and rummaged, came up with a small photo of the kind itinerant fruit pickers have in their passport, passed it across. It was the face of a child barely old enough to sit up, with big round eyes, a solemn mouth, hair cut short and tied with a messy bow.</p>
   <p>“That’s Little Anya,” he said. “My kid, see? I don’t see her in maybe twenty-five years now, but I never forget. I had to give her up, yeah; but I don’t forget. I get a stake, I come out here and make good. Now I want to find her, make it up to her. You can help me, huh?”</p>
   <p>I got a pipe out of the drawer and poked at it with a burned matchstick.</p>
   <p>“Listen,” he said. “Lacey says you’re a all right guy. I tell you a secret. Anya ain’t really my kid at all. I picked her up on the street in Ybor City, just a poor little throwed-away baby. I don’t know who her real folks was. Maybe I didn’t have no right―but what the hell―a little kid like that . . . .”</p>
   <p>“Stole her, huh?”</p>
   <p>“You don’t know how it was in them days. Or maybe you do. It wasn’t like now. No big welfare handouts. Nobody give a damn. I put her in a home―a nice place, trees and flowers, other kids to play with. I got to go away, business, you know? Then I come back; she’s gone. They give her away. Give her to some stranger; they say I signed papers that let them do that―the lousy punks. My Anya!”</p>
   <p>I stared out the window, watching a high, fleecy cloud that looked like a unicorn’s head shred itself out into nothing.</p>
   <p>“I ask questions, but they wouldn’t tell me nothing,” Anglich went on. “So I wait, two, three years, until I got some of the stuff that talks the language all them guys can understand. Then I try again.”</p>
   <p>I looked at the photo on the desk and squared it up with a finger. Anglich hitched his chair closer. “There was a mug at the agency I got next. Cost me five cees but he told me Anya was took from the home by a couple name of Conroy, six months after I left her. They come West to work in a war plant. That’s the reason I come out here.”</p>
   <p>“You’ve been here six years. How does it happen you’re just now looking for her?”</p>
   <p>He leaned back and gave me an important frown. “I looked some the first year. But dough was tight; I got noplace. Now it’s different. I got something to offer Anya, now.” He took out a handkerchief that was less than a yard square and wiped under his chin and behind the ears with it.</p>
   <p>“Any lead on these Conroys?”</p>
   <p>“I figure maybe they changed their name.”</p>
   <p>“Uh-huh,” I said. “You don’t want a detective, Mr. Anglich, you want Adalian the Psychic. Now if you’re through wasting my time I’d like to catch up on my foot-dangling.”</p>
   <p>He thrust out his lower lip.</p>
   <p>“You telling me you won’t find Anya for me?”</p>
   <p>“You don’t really want me to, Mr. Anglich. You’re not really trying.”</p>
   <p>His head jumped back as if he’d been slapped with a fish. His jaw dropped. He reached up a big, square hand and felt tenderly of his chin. He grinned.</p>
   <p>“Hey,” he said. “Maybe you’re OK at that.” The grin dropped; he leaned forward and got an elbow on the desk. “Monday night I get a phone call. I don’t recognize the voice. The guy says, ‘Hey, maybe you’d like to see your daughter, Anya, huh?’ Just like that. After all these years.</p>
   <p>“I say ‘Yeah, sure, who’s this?’</p>
   <p>“ ‘Never mind that,’ the guy says. ‘Five grand is the price.’</p>
   <p>“I say, ‘You nuts or something?’ Stalling, see? He says, ‘You heard me, brother. Five grand. Just take off your sock and count the toes. No more, no less. Think it over. We’ll call you later.’ And he hangs up on me.”</p>
   <p>“And?”</p>
   <p>“Nothing. I pretty near go nuts waiting. I don’t get no call. And all the time I wonder: Who is this mug? What’s Anya to him? Maybe he’s got her someplace, maybe he’s hurting her! The dough don’t mean nothing―but if he hurts her, I break his neck with my hands.”</p>
   <p>I looked at him carefully; then I grinned a little. “Nuts, you’re just playing games.”</p>
   <p>He sat bolt upright and looked ominous; then he relaxed and put his big hands on the desk and looked at them.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, I’m still holding out. I dunno why.” He dipped into the inside pocket and fished out a small envelope, opened it and slipped out a second photograph, laid it in front of me.</p>
   <p>“This is supposed to be the guy, Conroy. It’s a old shot, made back when they taken Anya away.”</p>
   <p>I swiveled to get more light on the picture. It was a blurry snapshot of a turkey-thin fellow in a wide-cut white suit holding a shapeless Panama at his side, standing in front of a board fence. He had a bony, long-chinned face, thinning black hair, deep-set eyes that showed no light or warmth, a mouth like a carp that had been hooked plenty of times but never boated.</p>
   <p>“Better,” I said. “Not good, but better. Who have you showed this to? Lately, I mean.”</p>
   <p>Anglich shifted his seat in the chair. “I tried a couple local adoption agencies. My contact down South says these kind of outfits work together. According to him, they got to like inspect the foster home and that. But I draw a blank. They never seen Anya, they heard of no Conroy.”</p>
   <p>“This contact down South: would he have a name?”</p>
   <p>“Pate. A. J. Pate. But he’s out of the picture, years ago. Croaked, maybe. Too bad. I would of liked to of did the job myself. A rat like that. Selling a father info on his own kid, and holding out at that.”</p>
   <p>“Holding out what?”</p>
   <p>“That pic you’re looking at. I was tipped he had it. I had to twist the sucker plenty before he come acrost.”</p>
   <p>“Let’s get this straight,” I said. “You’ve got a couple of twenty-five-year-old snaps and a name, and you want me to tie it to a woman who would be about twenty-six or-seven years old, probably married with three kids, and wouldn’t know you from Noah’s pet mongoose.”</p>
   <p>He frowned and rubbed his chin, watching me. I got a bottle of rye out of the deep drawer and poured a couple of ponies. He picked his up and threw it at his tonsils as if he was mad at them.</p>
   <p>“It don’t sound like much the way you put it,” he said. “But I got to find her, Shaw―and fast.” His voice implored me, as if all he had to do was convince me.</p>
   <p>I sampled my drink. It was as good as warm whisky usually is. “Why not tell me what’s really bothering you, Mr. Anglich? Then maybe I can tell you if there’s anything in all this.”</p>
   <p>He put his hands flat on the desk and stared down at the square, manicured nails.</p>
   <p>“I’m being tailed,” he said in a dead voice. “I spotted the guy two, three times already. Or maybe there’s two of ‘em. In a gray VW with a crease in the left front fender. They been on me for two days now.”</p>
   <p>“Any idea who’d be that interested?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah. You could say I left some unfinished business back in Tampa. At least there’s guys might see it that way.” He shook his head. “I thought I was clean, after six years. But I guess once you get that kind of dirt on you, it don’t never come off.” His eyes were on me again, scared eyes. “That’s why I got to find Anya now, fast. Before it’s too late.”</p>
   <p>“Talking that way doesn’t get you anywhere,” I said, and poured him another shot. “Mob rub-outs have gone out of style.”</p>
   <p>“OK, so maybe I’m nuts. But what if I ain’t? Lacey said you were a all right guy, Shaw. Help me find little Anya.”</p>
   <p>I reached across and slid the bills out from under the pen stand, flaked off one, handed the others back to him. A slow grin lit his battered old face like sunshine on rock.</p>
   <p>“I knew you were a all right guy, Shaw,” he said.</p>
   <p>“Sure, I’m a good guy,” I said. “But don’t get up a testimonial dinner just yet. I’ll see what I can do. That may turn out to be nothing. It has before, plenty of times.”</p>
   <p>“Just so you try, Shaw. That’s all I’m asking.”</p>
   <p>“I’ll want the address of the orphanage, the places you’ve tried here, anything you’ve got on these Conroys, where they worked and so on.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, sure, I remember all I can.” He remembered out loud for a while, and I wrote it down. It wasn’t much. He wiped his nose with the back of his hand and watched me frown at my notes.</p>
   <p>“Don’t expect too much,” I said. “After this long you know chances aren’t good. And if I turn up anything it might cost you some money.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t worry. I got plenty scratch.” He stood and jammed the leftover bills in a pocket.</p>
   <p>“Where can I reach you?” I asked. “If I get anything.”</p>
   <p>“I ain’t settled. I’ll call in.” He turned to the door, turned back.</p>
   <p>“One other thing,” he said. “When Anya was just a little baby, she always loved dogs.”</p>
   <p>“Sure,” I said. “I’ll remember that.”</p>
   <p>He rolled on out, as silent as a shadow for all his tonnage. I hardly heard the outer door click.</p>
   <p>I put his hundred in my shirt pocket, mixed myself a long drink, and sat down in the chair that was still warm from him. I played with the drink for a while and watched the light get yellower and the shadows creep across the office.</p>
   <p>I rinsed the glass out at the wash bowl and looked at my face in the mirror. It looked back at me. The years had left a lot of tracks on it. I yawned, giving myself a good view of my fillings.</p>
   <p>“You’re lucky, Shaw,” I said. “You’ve got your own teeth to have fillings in.”</p>
   <p>I put on my coat and went down to the street.</p>

    <p>Chapter 2</p>
   </title>
   <p>Morry Blumenthal was a lean, grizzle-haired sourpuss. He was also city editor of the <emphasis>Independent.</emphasis> He was sitting back of a desk that had probably been new once―about the time Henry Ford raised wages to five dollars a day. His eyes were closed. When I was six feet away he opened them and yawned. “Hello, Joe. You still on the outside?”</p>
   <p>“Don’t let me bother you if you’re working,” I said. I got out the picture Anglich said was a man named Conroy, held it out to him.</p>
   <p>“I’ll bet you can’t put a name to the face.”</p>
   <p>He rolled an eye at it, closed both eyes. “You win.”</p>
   <p>“Try again. There’s ten bucks riding on it.”</p>
   <p>He stretched out an arm that was not as long as a deck crane and took the photo, frowned at it, frowned at me.</p>
   <p>“Well―I could be wrong. This is an old picture, late thirties I’d say by the cut of the suit. And faces change. But it could be . . . “</p>
   <p>“Sure. Could be who?”</p>
   <p>“Remember old man Prendergast?”</p>
   <p>“Me too,” I said. “Let’s go browse the clip files.”</p>
   <p>“What’s it about?”</p>
   <p>“It’s too early to say―as they say in the papers.”</p>
   <p>A cute little blond typist looked up grinning and winked at me as he unfolded himself and led the way down an aisle of desks into a room full of filing cabinets. It was a minute or two before he grunted and tossed a folder on the table.</p>
   <p>“Have fun, pal. Even an old buzzard as publicity-shy as Prendergast gets mentioned a few times in twenty years.”</p>
   <p>I leafed through it: Mr. Harvey Wade Prendergast, noted industrialist, attends NAM conference, returns from tour of European business centers, lays cornerstone, plans merger, dies suddenly. There were a few half tone cuts of the narrow bloodless face, the hair slicked sideways across the skull, looking much as it did in the photo Anglich had given me―if the photo was really Prendergast. There was no mention of any family.</p>
   <p>“Prendergast have any children?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“A daughter or two, as I recall. And of course, a wife.”</p>
   <p>“How old? The daughters, I mean.”</p>
   <p>“Old enough. Late twenties, I guess. Why?”</p>
   <p>“The obit says he died of acute food poisoning after a family picnic. Botulism. Kind of an old-fashioned way to go.”</p>
   <p>“He was an old-fashioned guy. Hell, he still wore wing collars with his dinner suit.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t suppose there was any question about the diagnosis?”</p>
   <p>Morry looked at me sideways. “After two years, I’d say the question is academic.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah. Just my instinct for the nasty thought. By the way, was either of the daughters adopted?”</p>
   <p>Morry pulled at a long lower lip. “Not that I ever heard. You could go out and ask them―but don’t say I sent you.”</p>
   <p>“The family still at the same address?”</p>
   <p>“I haven’t heard of five acres in Mayfair Heights going on the market.”</p>
   <p>I thanked him, promised him a drink at an unspecified date, and went on out.</p>
   <p>The blond girl was still typing, but now she looked sad and disappointed, as if the funny man had turned out to be a villain after all.</p>
   <p>It was too late in the day for social calls. I had a sandwich and three or four drinks, sat through most of a movie that had been photographed during a power failure, and went home to bed.</p>

    <p>Chapter 3</p>
   </title>
   <p>The Harvey Wade Prendergast house was on one of those wide, curving streets that was laid out before they started platting real estate by the square inch. A Korean gardener who was manicuring a pansy bed spared me a sneer as I turned in at the gate. The house was big, but not more than twenty rooms, with a Spanish tile roof and lots of wrought iron in the right places, some nice imported trees, plenty of magnolias and bougainvillaea, and a circular parking space at the top of the drive with two cars parked in it. One was a little silvery-gray Jaguar and the other a big yellow El Dorado. Farther back I could see a four-car garage and grounds stretching across to some stately old trees that seemed to stand a little aloof from the rest of the composition, as if they’d been there before the house and would be there after it was gone.</p>
   <p>I pulled in beyond the Jaguar and set the brake and got out and sniffed some expensive morning air of the kind that’s only found behind trimmed hedges, above clipped lawns. It was nice air, filtered and scented; the breeze blew with a pleasant restraint; it knew better than to get tough around here.</p>
   <p>I went along the flagstones to the front door, which was built up out of rough oak planks and hung on iron straps and looked strong enough to withstand a siege. Before I had time to poke the bell, the door opened and a smooth-looking old bird in a fawn-colored jacket and an ascot tie and a nice head of wavy gray hair stepped out. He looked a little surprised to see me.</p>
   <p>He said, “Oh―was there something?” and stood with his hand on the doorknob, not exactly blocking my entrance, but not exactly ushering me in, either.</p>
   <p>“Shaw is the name,” I said. “Mrs. Prendergast at home?”</p>
   <p>“I’m afraid Mrs. Prendergast isn’t seeing anyone just now. She’s not well, you know. Possibly I could help, Mr. . . . .. ah . . . Shaw.”</p>
   <p>“I was hoping to talk to a member of the family.”</p>
   <p>“I’m Frank Prendergast, Mrs. Prendergast’s brother-in-law.”</p>
   <p>“Then maybe you could help me, Mr. Prendergast.” I got out my snapshot―not the one of Anya―and flashed it. Uncle Frank gave it a sharp look, lifted his pale eyebrows at me.</p>
   <p>“Where did you get this?” He took the picture in bony, manicured fingers and studied it, frowning a little in a well-bred way.</p>
   <p>“Can you identify it, Mr. Prendergast?”</p>
   <p>He pushed his lips in and out, tapped the picture against his palm. “Just who are you, Mr. Shaw?”</p>
   <p>“I just drove over from the<emphasis> Independent</emphasis> in the hope of checking out a few things, Mr. Prendergast.”</p>
   <p>“What sort of things, may I ask?”</p>
   <p>“This photo, for a start.”</p>
   <p>“What possible connection might there be between my family―my brother’s family, I should say―and anything that would be of interest to a―a person in your position?” He asked this in a mildly puzzled way, as if the whole thing was a bit daffy.</p>
   <p>“That’s what I’m trying to find out, Mr. Prendergast.”</p>
   <p>“We seem to be asking each other questions, Mr. Shaw,” he said. “Very well, I see no reason to be reticent. This is Harvey Prendergast, my brother. Taken many years ago, of course.” He handed the photo back to me.</p>
   <p>“Would that be before the birth of his daughters?”</p>
   <p>His smile stiffened. “Perhaps you’d better tell me just what this is all about, sir.” He glanced at his wristwatch. I took it he didn’t want any long explanations.</p>
   <p>I nodded judiciously. “As you say, there’s nothing to be cagey about. No reason the newspapers shouldn’t have it.”</p>
   <p>A hard little smile twitched at the corners of his mouth.</p>
   <p>“You’re not playing fair, sir. I answered your question. I think you have an obligation to answer mine, eh?”</p>
   <p>“Right here on the doorstep?”</p>
   <p>“Suppose you step inside, Mr. Shaw.” He stepped back and we grinned slyly at each other, two smart cookies fencing delicately with poisoned foils. I went in past him into a hallway lined with pictures of somebody’s ancestors, along that to a pair of glass-paneled doors which opened into a sunroom that had lots of big rattan chairs with plum-colored cushions, lots of low glass-topped tables to go with the chairs, a big fiber rug that would be hell on bare feet, and a view on two sides of lawn and flowers and a swimming pool. Except for the cool whisper of the air conditioning the whole house was perfectly silent.</p>
   <p>He waved me to a chair and sat down, carefully pulling his trousers up to save the crease. He was wearing brown silk socks with white clocks, and tan-and-white shoes just out of the box, still shiny on the bottom. Above the socks his legs were as thin and white as rolled newspapers.</p>
   <p>“Drink, Mr. Shaw? I seldom indulge, especially on such a beautiful morning, so you’ll excuse me if I don’t join you.”</p>
   <p>“No, thanks.”</p>
   <p>He nodded brightly. “Now, then,” he said comfortably. “What’s this about newspapers?” We understood each other now; now we’d get down to cases.</p>
   <p>“That was just a gag,” I said. “Where was Mr. Prendergast living at the time the picture was taken?”</p>
   <p>Uncle Frank looked at me sharply. “You were going to tell me how you came by that photograph, Mr. Shaw.”</p>
   <p>“I’m not at liberty to say, Mr. Prendergast. Would there be any way of tying it down, as to time and place?”</p>
   <p>“None whatever. Look here, sir―”</p>
   <p>“I understand the Prendergast daughters are in their late twenties. From the style of the suit, I’d say the picture was about the same age.”</p>
   <p>“Kindly tell me just what it is you’re after, sir.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t really know, Mr. Prendergast. I drove out here to ask about the picture. I expected to be told it was made at the family picnic in ‘forty-four, or was it ‘forty-five, and what about it. Either that, or to be given the fast gate. Instead, here we are, all settled down ready for you to pump me. For a man in my position, that’s enough to make me curious, if I wasn’t before.”</p>
   <p>“Well, you’re candid enough.” For a moment his eyes measured me; then he relaxed and gave a light laugh. He lifted a liver-spotted hand and let it fall back.</p>
   <p>“Very well, Mr. Shaw, I seem to have handled this encounter badly. I confess to being a nosy old man. There’s not a great deal in my life any more to interest me. When a large, competent-looking chap such as yourself appears on my doorstep waving a photograph of my brother, naturally I’m intrigued. And naturally I’m not in the habit of giving out information of a semi-personal nature to any stranger who happens to inquire.”</p>
   <p>“You said ‘my doorstep.’” I cocked an eyebrow at him.</p>
   <p>“The house is my sister-in-law’s, of course. But I’ve made my home here for the past two years. Mrs. Prendergast has never recovered fully from the shock of my brother’s death, poor lady.”</p>
   <p>“What did he die of?”</p>
   <p>“Food poisoning. A tragic thing. But even in this day and age―”</p>
   <p>“What kind of food?”</p>
   <p>“Lobster salad, as I recall. But―”</p>
   <p>“Anyone else get sick?”</p>
   <p>“As a matter of fact, I was quite ill myself; but lobster was a great favorite of Harvey’s. He ate the bulk of the contaminated salad.”</p>
   <p>“You were visiting at the time?”</p>
   <p>“Actually, I had moved West a year or two before. But look here, Mr. Shaw―what has all this to do with your inquiry―whatever it is?”</p>
   <p>“How did Harvey Prendergast make his money?”</p>
   <p>“I think I’ve talked enough for this morning.” He put his hands on his knees as if about to push himself up out of his chair.</p>
   <p>“All these things are a matter of public record, Mr. Prendergast,” I said. “I could dig the information out of the newspaper files.”</p>
   <p>“Then why ask me?”</p>
   <p>“Why not answer me?”</p>
   <p>“Perhaps I have other uses for my time.”</p>
   <p>“What do you do for a living, Mr. Prendergast?”</p>
   <p>“I’m retired.” This with a delivery like a mousetrap.</p>
   <p>“From what?”</p>
   <p>“From business.<emphasis> My</emphasis> business, Mr. Shaw.”</p>
   <p>“Uh-huh. Harvey Prendergast was in the shipping line, wasn’t he?”</p>
   <p>“He owned controlling interests in a number of steamship companies, among other enterprises, yes.”</p>
   <p>“You weren’t connected with his companies?”</p>
   <p>“Harvey and I were never close.” This time he stood. “And now I think you’d better go, Mr. Shaw.”</p>
   <p>“You mean before I tell you where I got the picture of Harvey?”</p>
   <p>“Very well―where<emphasis> did</emphasis> you get it?”</p>
   <p>“Why do you want to know?”</p>
   <p>He got a little white around the lips. For just a moment I got the feeling that in his younger days Uncle Frank might have been a bad man to play games with.</p>
   <p>“Out,” he said. “Before you force me to forget I’m a gentleman.”</p>
   <p>I stood. “Mr. Prendergast, I’m a private detective. It’s my business to ask questions, not answer them. My having the picture bothers you. You being bothered bothers me. The fact that you didn’t throw me out on my ear a lot sooner bothers me even more. When I get bothered my instinct is to dig harder.”</p>
   <p>“You’re reading too much into an old man’s curiosity, Mr. Shaw.”</p>
   <p>“When and where were Harvey’s daughters born, Mr. Prendergast?”</p>
   <p>“Early in the war. On the East Coast. I’m a little vague about it.” He made a vague gesture, showing me how vague he was about it.</p>
   <p>“Maybe I’d better talk to one of the Misses Prendergast personally,” I said. He opened his mouth to be rude and changed his mind.</p>
   <p>“Perhaps that would be best.” He looked at his strap watch again. “I’m quite late for an appointment. If you’ll wait, I’ll see if either of my nieces is able to see you.” He went out, banging the door a little on the way.</p>
   <p>I lit up a cigarette and looked out of the wide windows across the end of the room. Out back the gardener was dumping a wheelbarrow full of something into an outdoor fireplace, and sneering at that. A bird hopped across the terrace, busy on bird business. Sunlight sparkled like rhinestones on the pool. A few minutes went past, as minutes will.</p>
   <p>A door opened across the room―not the one we had come in by―and a man came into the room. He was tall, broad, thick-bodied, dressed in a plain dark suit that somehow had a look of uniform about it. He halted and did a clumsy double-take, expressing surprise.</p>
   <p>“Beg pardon, sir,” he said, and slitted his eyes at me. Maybe he was smiling. “I was just seeing to the ash trays.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t mind me,” I said. “Just tell me when to lift my feet.”</p>
   <p>He gave me a quick frisk with his eyes. If he saw anything that pleased him he did a good job of concealing it.</p>
   <p>“I’m waiting for Miss Prendergast,” I told him before he asked.</p>
   <p>“The name . . . sir?”</p>
   <p>“Joe Shaw. I didn’t call ahead. I guess I should have gone around to the back door.”</p>
   <p>“What was it concerning, Mr. Shaw?”</p>
   <p>“Private.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t think Miss Mianne has time for you today, Mr. Shaw.” This with a flat delivery.</p>
   <p>“I’ll risk it.” I grinned and winked at him. “If it’s OK with you.”</p>
   <p>His face went wooden. He turned to the door.</p>
   <p>“You forgot the ash trays,” I said. He looked back, lifted his lip.</p>
   <p>“I’ll see if the lady wants you thrown out on your ear.” He eased out, leaving the door half open.</p>
   <p>I sat in the chair and felt thirsty. Around to the side of the house the gardener was slashing savagely at the lugustrum hedge with a big pair of shears now, still sneering. Or maybe his face was just built that way. There was a solid mass of tea-rose begonias under the window and a round carpet of purple and yellow pansies under an acacia tree. Pinks lined the walk that wandered across the lawn. Maybe it wasn’t a sneer at all; maybe it was a smile of quiet satisfaction at a job well done. And well paid.</p>
   <p>There was a sliding glass door in the center of the bank of windows. I got up and went over to it, opened it, stepped out on the terrace. There was a heavy, sweet odor of gardenias in the air. I took two steps toward the edge of the terrace and a big black and tan shepherd dog wearing a broad horsehide collar came around the corner. His eyes were yellowish, with a wolfish slant. He came quickly toward me on his big rough paws, ears alert, stopped ten feet away. His ears flattened. His hackles bristled; he growled deep in his throat, a sound like a diesel idling.</p>
   <p>I stood where I was, without moving a muscle. I thought the dog would want it just that way; I knew that if I took a step, even to retreat, he’d attack. I remembered reading somewhere that dogs can smell fear. I tried hard to smell brave.</p>
   <p>Then a girl came around the path and called to the dog. His ears pricked up and he stopped growling, but he didn’t move. The girl came up quickly and hooked her fingers in his collar. She patted the side of his neck and rumpled his ears, and said, “Good old Robbie, good old boy.” She glanced at me.</p>
   <p>“That can be dangerous, walking around the grounds unescorted.” She was a nice, quiet-looking little girl with soft, curly brown hair and a tender, vulnerable mouth that didn’t seem to have done enough smiling in its time. She was wearing a light green gardening smock with enough smudges on it to suggest she wasn’t just wearing it for effect.</p>
   <p>“Sorry,” I said. “I didn’t see the sign.”</p>
   <p>“I didn’t mean to be rude. But Robbie’s trained to guard the house.” She let him forward far enough to sniff my knee.</p>
   <p>“Looks like a fine animal,” I said. “You train him yourself?”</p>
   <p>“The Army trained him at the Special Forces School at Benning. But he broke a tooth and they flunked him. And he’s not really mine. He belongs to Mianne.”</p>
   <p>“But you’re the one he’s got a crush on.”</p>
   <p>She smiled quickly. “It’s mutual.”</p>
   <p>She patted his shoulder absently and started off along the path. I dropped into step beside her.</p>
   <p>“Mianne is your sister?”</p>
   <p>“Of course. I’m Ellen Prendergast.” We were near the parking area. She glanced across at my car, didn’t see anything painted on the side of it. “May I ask your business here?”</p>
   <p>“Shaw is the name. I was waiting to talk to Miss Mianne.”</p>
   <p>“You have an appointment?” She sounded a little worried, as if she ought to have known about it if I had an appointment.</p>
   <p>“No, but your uncle Frank said he’d see.”</p>
   <p>“You know Uncle Frank?”</p>
   <p>“Not well.”</p>
   <p>She glanced at an upstairs window with closed drapes. “Mianne isn’t up yet.”</p>
   <p>“What about Mrs. Prendergast?”</p>
   <p>“Mother doesn’t see callers, Mr. Shaw.”</p>
   <p>“I see. About Miss Mianne: will she be getting up for lunch?”</p>
   <p>“You mustn’t be impertinent. Just what was it you wanted to see her about, Mr. Shaw?”</p>
   <p>Just then the closed drapes up above stirred and came open a foot or two. A tall, slim figure in a fluffy pink something was standing there working a hairbrush on a glossy mane of black hair. At that distance I couldn’t see much but the figure, but there was plenty of that.</p>
   <p>“She seems to be up now,” the little girl I was talking to said in a tone with a nice snap to it, calling me to heel. J let my gaze linger up above long enough to let Miss Mianne catch me looking at her. If it bothered her, she didn’t show it. She turned away lazily, still brushing.</p>
   <p>“Well, you made quite a hit,” the nice little girl said.</p>
   <p>“She doesn’t smile at just anyone this early in the day.”</p>
   <p>“Tsk,” I said. “Is that any way to talk about Miss Mianne?”</p>
   <p>She looked at me primly for a second and then let a smile show, just for a moment, like a shy woodland creature.</p>
   <p>“Please come in, Mr. Shaw,” she said. “I’ll tell her she has a caller.”</p>
   <p>She leaned to pat the dog and whisper in his ear; he strolled off and she led me in a side door under a trellis full of scarlet climbing roses and along a rather narrow tiled passage into a big parquet-floored entry hall. Across that, and we were back in the sunroom.</p>
   <p>“Please sit down. It may be a few minutes. If you’ll excuse me . . . “</p>
   <p>“Why not stay and talk awhile, Miss Prendergast.”</p>
   <p>She looked at me coolly. “I can’t imagine what we’d talk about, Mr. Shaw.” She went out and closed the door silently behind her. The Prendergasts were great ones for letting the old family detective commune with himself in the sunroom.</p>
   <p>I went back and sat in my chair and wished I’d taken that drink after all. Uncle Frank had told Miss Mianne I was here. She’d been watching me through the drapes when I went outside. But he hadn’t told Miss Ellen. I wondered if that meant anything, other than that Mianne had been in her bedroom and Ellen out in the potting shed. Uncle Frank had also sent the hard boy in the dark suit in to look me over. That was all right too. A family of women and one elderly man had a perfect right to hire a bodyguard if they wanted to.</p>
   <p>It was a good quarter hour before the door the butler had used swung in and a tall, black-haired beauty came halfway across the room and smiled. She wore a white knitted something that showed lots of smooth, tanned shoulder and a nice pair of knees. There were hints of color in the dark eyes, of latent warmth in the curve of her lips. Her cheek line and jaw showed the kind of bone structure that separates the stars from the extras.</p>
   <p>“I’m Mianne Prendergast,” she said in a voice that made it sound like a secret joke between us. I got up out of my chair.</p>
   <p>“Shaw,” I said. “It’s good of you to see me, Miss Prendergast.” I took the hand she offered me. It was a nice hand, well shaped, strong, smooth, and not too much paint on the nails. She let me hold it while she looked into my face.</p>
   <p>“Do I know you, Mr. Shaw?”</p>
   <p>“I’m afraid not. Actually, it was Mrs. Prendergast I wanted to see.”</p>
   <p>“Mother?” She took her hand back and strolled over to the windows. “Mother doesn’t often have an attractive male caller. Could you tell me what it’s about?” She turned and smiled encouragingly.</p>
   <p>“Miss Prendergast, did you ever know a family named Conroy?”</p>
   <p>She pursed her lips a little, shook her head. “I don’t think so.”</p>
   <p>I got out my snapshot of the man with the Panama hat and showed it to her. She glanced at it.</p>
   <p>“It’s Daddy, isn’t it?” she sounded a little surprised. “Taken a long time ago. He looks so young.” She took the picture and looked at it sadly. “It’s hard to believe he was ever young.”</p>
   <p>“How old was your father at the time of his death?”</p>
   <p>“Oh―all of seventy, I imagine. He was very secretive about his age. He was much older than Mother, of course.”</p>
   <p>“You don’t happen to know when or where the picture was taken?”</p>
   <p>“I haven’t an idea. Probably before I was born, judging by the funny old suit Daddy’s wearing.” She handed the picture back.</p>
   <p>“You don’t happen to have a baby picture of yourself, Miss Prendergast?”</p>
   <p>“My parents weren’t camera bugs, Mr. Shaw. As a matter of fact, my father hated to have his picture taken. I suppose we all absorbed his attitude.” She gave me the conspiratorial smile again. “But you still haven’t said why you’re asking all these questions.”</p>
   <p>I was smiling back at her. “That’s right, I haven’t,” I agreed.</p>
   <p>“But then, I haven’t given you many answers, have I? I’m afraid I haven’t been of much help. Maybe it would be better if you did talk to Mother.”</p>
   <p>“I understood she wasn’t seeing anyone.”</p>
   <p>“Nonsense, Mother loves visitors. Where did you get an idea like that?”</p>
   <p>“Just an impression I picked up, maybe.” I followed her out into the hall and up a sweeping staircase with blue carpet and a white-painted oak handrail of the kind that nobody’s known how to make for a generation.</p>
   <p>Miss Prendergast was a nice, friendly girl, glad to interrupt her shopping trip to help out a fellow with a problem. Uncle Frank had met me first; then Miss Ellen. Miss Mianne had had her look. Now it was Mrs. Prendergast’s turn. It was a nice, smooth routine, almost as if it had been planned that way. As if they had been expecting me.</p>

    <p>Chapter 4</p>
   </title>
   <p>She was propped up in a big bed like a Parisian doll on display in a show window. There was lace on the pillows and on the curtains at the window beside her; the bed jacket she wore was a mass of frills and tiny embroidered rosebuds. Her hair was that shade of gray that blonde hair turns to, and it looked as if it had been fussed over for a couple of hours by Andre of the Ritz. The face under the coiffure was thin, lined, almost without color; but traces of what it had been once still lingered there, like a hint of perfume in a room where a princess has slept.</p>
   <p>“Mother, this is Mr. Shaw to see you,” Miss Mianne said softly. She drew a chair with a brocaded seat around for me beside the bed and retired silently into the background.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Prendergast looked at me with her big faded violet eyes. Her hands lay on the coverlet like plucked sparrows.</p>
   <p>“I don’t believe I know you, Mr. Shaw,” she said in a whispery voice, a voice murmuring in a deserted ballroom.</p>
   <p>“I’m a private detective, Mrs. Prendergast. I appreciate your seeing me. What I have to say won’t take very long.” I patted a couple of pockets and frowned. I hitched around in my chair and grinned foolishly at Miss Mianne.</p>
   <p>“Some sleuth,” I said. “I must have dropped the picture on the way up.” Before I could go through the motions of rising she said, “Don’t get up,” and slipped through the door. I turned back to the invalid.</p>
   <p>“I’ll be brief, Mrs. Prendergast,” I said quickly. “I’m trying to trace a child who was adopted from an East Coast orphanage in 1942. A little girl with dark hair. It seems her father has come into money. Not a lot of money, but enough that he’d like to see his daughter get it. There’d be no strings, of course. Just an anonymous donor.” As I talked, her face tightened, became stark and bloodless. Her eyes were like eyes peering out between the bars of a cell.</p>
   <p>“My God,” she said. “Who sent you<emphasis> here?”</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Just following up a lead, Mrs. Prendergast. Lots of leads lead nowhere. Maybe this is one of those. But it might save time all around if you could tell me if you recognize this picture.” I took out the photo of little Anya and held it for her to look at. She barely glanced at it.</p>
   <p>“What do you want from me? I’m a dying woman.”</p>
   <p>“I hoped you’d tell me whether this is your daughter.”</p>
   <p>She stared at me as though I’d just said something astounding. Then she swore.</p>
   <p>She knew all the words. She used them with skill and imagination, covering my ancestry, present habits, and future offspring. I listened until she finished and lay back panting, her mouth sagging open like a picked pocket.</p>
   <p>“There must have been something in the picture I missed,” I said. I tucked it away and got out the other. “Care to try this one?”</p>
   <p>She spat on it.</p>
   <p>“Thanks for your valuable assistance, ma’am,” I said. “That rounds things out nicely.”</p>
   <p>“Get out, you filthy, creeping, sneaking . . . “</p>
   <p>“Sure, right away. By the way, which girl is the adopted one?”</p>
   <p>She made a noise like a chicken strangling. Suddenly she was crying, big wet tears spilling out of the big pale eyes, cutting tracks across the powdered cheeks.</p>
   <p>“I hated him,” she pushed out the words in choked gasps. “God, how I hated him―”</p>
   <p>The door behind me banged open. Miss Ellen came through it with a prairie fire in each eye.</p>
   <p>“Get out!” She bit the words off like an infantryman pulling a grenade pin with his teeth. “Who let you up here? What have you been saying to Mother?” She brushed past me, making distressed sounds.</p>
   <p>I went out in the hall. Mianne Prendergast was there, looking contrite.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry,” she said. “I thought it would be all right.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah,” I said, a little savagely. “You must have read the signals wrong.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, dear. I hope Mother wasn’t rude?”</p>
   <p>“I wouldn’t call it that.”</p>
   <p>“I’d like to make it up to you. Perhaps if we talked again? I could meet you in town―tomorrow, say?”</p>
   <p>“My office is in the Banshire Building.”</p>
   <p>She shook her head. “You know the Penguin Lounge?”</p>
   <p>“A long time ago I did―if it’s the same place. On Cigale, near Sixth?”</p>
   <p>“At two o’clock?” She offered her hand, gave mine a quick squeeze.</p>
   <p>“Don’t be late,” I said, “or I’ll have a snootful.”</p>
   <p>The butler came up then; he managed to conduct me down to the door without socking me. I made it around to my car without meeting Robbie. Maybe the old Shaw luck was still in. I’d paid a call on the upper crust and gotten away with nothing that a good hot bath and a couple of stiff shots of rye wouldn’t cure.</p>
   <p>When I got back to the office the phone was ringing.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>
    <p>Chapter 5</p>
   </title>
   <p>It went on ringing as I crossed the outer office, unlocked the inner door, parked myself behind the desk and got out the office bottle. It rang while I poured and while I capped the bottle and put it away. I listened to it ring while I rolled the stuff on my tongue, made a face, and swallowed it. It tasted like what they keep pathology specimens in.</p>
   <p>“Joe Shaw, Investigator, licensed by the city of Los Angeles, at your service with a smile on the lip right along with the knuckle bruises,” I said, and lifted the receiver.</p>
   <p>“Shaw?” a tight, furtive voice said. “This is Albert P. Jaster calling. There’s a matter we ought to talk over.”</p>
   <p>“What’s it about, Mr. Jaster?”</p>
   <p>“I’m not free to discuss it over the telephone.”</p>
   <p>“Could you tell me who you are, Mr. Jaster? Over the telephone, I mean.”</p>
   <p>“I’m an attorney.” There was a little snap in the voice now.</p>
   <p>“Well, that’s fine, Mr. Jaster. Would it be a breech of security to tell me where you got my name?”</p>
   <p>“Maybe you don’t get me, Shaw. What I have is hot. Very hot.”</p>
   <p>I leaned over and lifted the city directory off the shelf, opened it to the J’s, and went down the list. I found two J asters, but no Albert P.</p>
   <p>“Are you still there, Shaw?”</p>
   <p>“Still here, Mr. Jaster.” I put the directory back and tried the yellow pages, ran a finger down the columns of lawyers. No Jaster listed.</p>
   <p>“Well―what about it?” he said.</p>
   <p>“What about what?”</p>
   <p>He made an annoyed sound. “Get wise, Shaw. This is a serious business proposition. You’d better get over here right away.”</p>
   <p>“Where would that be, Mr. Jaster?”</p>
   <p>“I have offices in the Russon Building. Room 619.”</p>
   <p>“Look, Mr. Jaster, I don’t want to give the impression I don’t want your business, but I’d have to have more than the temperature of this matter of yours before I expose myself to the direct rays of the afternoon sun.”</p>
   <p>I listened to some hoarse breathing into the mouthpiece that suggested halitosis. He cleared his throat.</p>
   <p>“Anya,” he said.</p>
   <p>“Go on.”</p>
   <p>“That’s all you get―over the phone.”</p>
   <p>“Well, you’ve intrigued me after all, Mr. Jaster,” I said. “Maybe I will drive over there, say in an hour?”</p>
   <p>“I’m leaving in thirty minutes.” There was a clack and I was listening to a dial tone.</p>
   <p>“You played that one just right, Shaw,” I said. “Smooth, snappy, and you didn’t give away more than ten pounds and a horseshoe.”</p>
   <p>I tried the bottle again just to confirm my first impression, locked up the office, and rode the elevator down to the parking lot.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>
    <p>Chapter 6</p>
   </title>
   <p>The Russon Building was on Serrano, a chalky stucco front with the date 1928 in green tiles above the entrance. A menu board inside listed a dozen or two names with an air of tired defeat about them. From the amount of dust in sight I had a feeling that a lot of the names had moved on long ago. Jaster’s wasn’t there. Probably his idea of playing it cagey.</p>
   <p>I rode one of the original Otis elevators up to the sixth floor and prowled along the corridor. Number 619 was locked. I gave it the old bootlegger’s knuckle, light and confidential. Something squeaked inside. The knob rattled. The black varnished door opened on a pale, wary face with a soft round chin, suety cheeks, an oily complexion, and an undernourished black mustache that drooped at the corners of delicately shaped lips pink enough to be rouged.</p>
   <p>He backed out of my way, looked along the hall before he closed the door behind me. “Nice to see you, Shaw,” he said. His hair was thin, combed forward; it looked like a toupee, except for the bald spot and the dandruff flakes. His dark suit needed cleaning. “Have a seat.” He bustled around behind the desk.</p>
   <p>It was a bare carpetless room paved in scuffed brown linoleum, with metal desks and filing cabinets in shades of gray that didn’t match. There were a couple of hard-looking chairs of different patterns, a built-in closet with a dark curtain, an open door into another room. I went over and looked in. It was a small windowless anteroom with chairs, magazines, a worn rug.</p>
   <p>“Sit down, sit down.” Jaster made an expansive gesture and settled into his swivel chair. It squeaked again. I got out a cigarette and blew smoke across at him. He picked up a chewed pencil and poked in his ear with it, looked at the point and frowned.</p>
   <p>“How do you figure it?” he asked suddenly. He seemed nervous, like a fellow who’s gotten the girl up to his apartment and doesn’t know what to do next.</p>
   <p>“Figure what?”</p>
   <p>He made marks on his desk calendar, looking casual. “How maybe we could do a little business together.”</p>
   <p>“What business would that be?”</p>
   <p>“Maybe about a client of yours,” he said quickly.</p>
   <p>“Have I got a client?”</p>
   <p>“You’re eating.” He looked at me now, a knowing look, like a dirty picture salesman back for a repeat order. “You could be eating better,” he said.</p>
   <p>“Like you.”</p>
   <p>His hand jerked and the pencil point broke. I grinned at him. He tossed the pencil on the blotter; it rolled across the desk and fell on the floor with a too-loud clatter. “Let’s not mouse around,” he said sternly. “What do you want?”</p>
   <p>I stood up. “Excuse it, please. I must have the wrong place. I understood somebody here wanted to see me.”</p>
   <p>“All right, all right―take it easy. Sit down, Shaw.”</p>
   <p>“What for―so you can try out another bunch of gag lines on me?” But I sat.</p>
   <p>“Don’t get too flip, Shaw. I’m wise. I saw the Hunky go to your office. Later I saw you pay a call on what the papers call a prominent local family.”</p>
   <p>My cigarette didn’t taste good. Maybe it was the atmosphere I was burning it in. I leaned across the desk and mashed it out in a bleary glass ash tray with a photo of Atlantic City on the bottom.</p>
   <p>“The Prendergasts,” I said. “You can say the name. It’s all right. Nice folks, the Prendergasts. Ever met Mrs. Prendergast?”</p>
   <p>His eyes jumped.</p>
   <p>“Oh, did I let something slip?” I leaned back and grinned at him.</p>
   <p>“We’re just kidding each other,” Jaster said. “Let’s get down on the rug.”</p>
   <p>“All right,” I said. “Let’s talk about Anya. Does that make it any easier?”</p>
   <p>He tensed, but kept his voice casual: “I happened to see the big guy on the street. I knew him, knew the kind of friends he had back East. I did a little checking, found out he was in the silk these days. I kept an eye on him, got wise he was making the rounds of adoption agencies. I know people in places. They gave me the name: Anya.”</p>
   <p>“So you phoned him.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe. Just sounding out the guy’s meat, you know.” He grinned a nasty grin. “He ain’t so tough.”</p>
   <p>“Let’s get on to the business we were going to do together.”</p>
   <p>He licked his red lips. He was tasting something he liked now. “I don’t know what routine he gave you, Shaw. You give it to me just the way he gave it to you, and I pick out what we need.”</p>
   <p>“What we need for what?”</p>
   <p>“To parlay the play into the big money. I know Anglich; I know plenty on the guy. But he don’t know me. Maybe he did once, but I changed a lot. Him, hardly at all. Now, I could handle it alone. But hell, there’s plenty in it for both of us―if we slice it right. Why be greedy? So I’m cutting you in.”</p>
   <p>“Nuts―you don’t know anything you can use, Jaster. You got me up here to tease something out of me. I had the same idea, maybe―but I can see I’m wasting my time.” I made a move as if to get up.</p>
   <p>“Hold it, Shaw,” he said sharply, and there was a little glitter of victory in his eyes. “I’m holding plenty cards, guy, don’t ever doubt it. Maybe I haven’t got it all in the can yet. Maybe there’s ways to play it I don’t see yet. But what I got is the goods. You put a guy like Anglich and a family like the Prendergasts together, and milk gotta flow.”</p>
   <p>“Why let me in on it? A smart fellow like you could handle it alone, given a little patience.”</p>
   <p>He leered across the stained blotter. “I got my feet dirty a few times in this town. I couldn’t get within a block of Mayfair Heights without being curbed by a carload of law. You’ve got the front I need to work in the open.”</p>
   <p>“Uh-huh. That’s what I’ve got. What’ve you got?”</p>
   <p>“Nix,” he said sharply. “You spill first. Then we take it from there.”</p>
   <p>I looked thoughtful. “We sell him a dutch, is that the idea? Or do you like the blackmail angle better?”</p>
   <p>He hitched himself around in his chair, his eyes on me, furtive as mice. “Depends,” he said. “How does it look from where you stand?”</p>
   <p>I grinned at him. “Like bluff, Mr. Jaster. You just want on for the ride.”</p>
   <p>He stared at me, gave a barking laugh. “You poor sap. I’m on the rail; you’re back in the pack. What’s to bluff?”</p>
   <p>I yawned. “If you’ve got anything solid to show me, better dig it out.”</p>
   <p>“Ah, hell,” he said, but he sounded contented. “I’m wasting my time with a guy like you.”</p>
   <p>I pushed back my chair and went across to the door; when my hand was on the knob he said, “Hey.” I looked back at him.</p>
   <p>“What about a straight cash deal?” he said, and grinned, watching me.</p>
   <p>“Straight how?”</p>
   <p>“Five grand for a line into the Hunky. Turn over what you’ve got and deal yourself out. How’s it sound?”</p>
   <p>I scratched the side of my jaw with a forefinger, which reminded me I needed a shave.</p>
   <p>“Suppose I top that,” I said. “Ten grand for information leading to a positive ID on the girl.”</p>
   <p>He grinned wider. “Take the air, Shaw. Come back when you’re ready to talk real money.”</p>
   <p>I nodded. “By the way, you drive a gray VW?”</p>
   <p>He looked blank. “They lifted my license.”</p>
   <p>“Let me know if you change your mind,” I said.</p>

    <p>Chapter 7</p>
   </title>
   <p>I bought myself lunch in one of those all-plastic eateries with matching cuisine and thought over the morning’s work, looking for the deep inner meanings. There didn’t seem to be any. Back at the office I made a few calls to acquaintances at the courthouse. There were no records covering the birth of the Prendergast girls. They were already part of the family when the family moved into Los Angeles County. I phoned the agencies Anglich had mentioned and got the swift chill-off. That seemed to be that for the day.</p>
   <p>I drove on home to the Cheshire. My chess problem was still laid out on the coffee table where I’d left it; nobody had solved it in my absence. I went out to the kitchenette and bought myself a quick shot from the guest Scotch bottle, stood under a hot shower long enough to steam the smell of Albert P. Jaster’s operation out of my pores, and stretched out on the sofa for a short siesta.</p>
   <p>It was twilight when the phone woke me. I yawned, and fumbled it to my ear. A thick, heavy voice, like the voice of a drowned man: “Shaw.”</p>
   <p>I gripped the phone tighter. “Go ahead, I know you.”</p>
   <p>“You better come quick. I got plenty trouble.”</p>
   <p>“Where are you?”</p>
   <p>“Hobart Apartments, 112 Bell Street, Room 211. One flight up, at the front.”</p>
   <p>“I’ve got it. What kind of trouble?” But I was talking to myself. He’d hung up on me.</p>
   <p>I got dressed and started for the door, then went back and got my Smith and Wesson short-nose and buckled it under my arm. It looked like it might be one of those trips.</p>
   <p>I kicked the little Olds I was driving that year to life, not without some persuasion. An early evening fog had drifted in from the beach, bringing along the usual quota of industrial waste. I drove east on Wilshire, riding bumpers, rushing the lights, then north on Alvarado. No more neon here. A vapor lamp on a pole showed me a sign that read Bell Street. I did two blocks up a slight incline, parked in front of a boarded-up red brick building that had been a funeral parlor in happier times.</p>
   <p>One-twelve was a three-story frame apartment house that somebody had tried to prop up with a layer of asbestos siding. It had a heavy green-painted door with thick cut-glass panels behind which faint light showed. I stepped inside, stood on warped linoleum with holes through which dark oak flooring showed, and listened to a lot of silence. Dim doors with metal numbers nailed to them lined the hall. Halfway back a staircase went up. Dull brass stair rods held down an eighteen-inch rubber runner that had given up fighting back a long time ago.</p>
   <p>At the top I prowled back toward the front. Two-eleven was at the end. I tapped lightly with a fingernail. There might have been a sound from inside. Behind another door across the hall somebody sneezed and went on sneezing. I tried the knob; it turned.</p>
   <p>The only light came from the pole lamp on the street, filtered through a torn roller shade. There was a patch of dark rug a chair, a brass double bed with a snarl of bedding hanging down over the foot.</p>
   <p>Lou Anglich was lying on the bed, propped up against a couple of pillows with striped ticks. His eyes were swollen almost shut. There was blood on his mouth, on his upper lip, on his chin. Bruises showed between the bloody places. There was a knot in front of his ear that made his face lopsided, misshapen. The broken mouth moved, said painfully:</p>
   <p>“You make good time, Shaw.”</p>
   <p>I went over and looked down at him. The gaudy jacket was scuffed and torn. His thick hands lay curled in his lap, the big knuckles raw.</p>
   <p>“What happened to you?”</p>
   <p>“I need a drink.” His head twitched in the direction of the chipped bureau against the wall. I got the bottle and uncapped it and held it to his split lips. He took a couple of swallows and breathed out harshly.</p>
   <p>“Three guys,” he said. “They jump me in a parking lot.”</p>
   <p>“You know who they were?”</p>
   <p>“Never see ‘em before. But I got a idea, OK.”</p>
   <p>“You ought to be in the hospital. Some of those cuts look bad.”</p>
   <p>“No hospital. After a while I feel better, I fix myself up then.”</p>
   <p>“You need a doctor to sew you up.”</p>
   <p>He started to sit up. “No doctor―and no cops.”</p>
   <p>I pushed him back. “Take it easy.” I got out my weeds and lit one, looking at him, feeling a thought coming to life.</p>
   <p>“Why no cops?”</p>
   <p>“I think maybe I croaked one of them punks.”</p>
   <p>I waited.</p>
   <p>“They hit me from behind, drag me inside a shed. They bounce me around pretty good then, but one of ‘em makes a mistake. He gets too close. I got strong hands. That makes it even. I wipe the other two mugs and I come here.”</p>
   <p>“Where did this happen?”</p>
   <p>“Back of a joint called Terry’s, over on Alamitos. A poolroom. I go in there sometimes to nibble a few. I ain’t comfortable in them downtown joints.”</p>
   <p>“Anybody see this fight?”</p>
   <p>“Hell, it ain’t no fight―not after I get warmed up. Anyways, it’s dark back there, no people around.”</p>
   <p>“What makes you think you killed this fellow?”</p>
   <p>Anglich looked down at his hands lying curled and bloody against his thighs. “I was holding his neck. I think I feel something break in there.”</p>
   <p>“So you walked off and left three men lying around for the cop on the beat to trip over.”</p>
   <p>“They’re inside. I close the door―I think.”</p>
   <p>“What makes you think you can’t be traced here?”</p>
   <p>“I ain’t followed. I move pretty good. I don’t leave no trail. Nobody sees me come in.” The broken mouth twitched. His eyes were glints between puffed slits. “I own this building. Wise guys, they jump me four blocks from my own property. But to hell with that, Shaw. That ain’t why I called you. They make a mistake only sending three guys with no iron. Next time they do it right. Yeah, they find me; not right away, but sometime. Those are the babies that never forget. OK, I don’t run away. I wait right here. But there’s one thing they don’t get. I been saving it a long time. It’s for Anya. You find her, Shaw. You give it to her.” He fumbled at his watch pocket with his thick fingers, brought out a flat brass key.</p>
   <p>“In a locker at the train station. A suitcase, real pigskin. Inside a hundred and fifty grand in tens and twenties. Little Anya’s inheritance from her old man. If they get me―see she gets it.”</p>
   <p>I looked at the key, turned it over and looked at the other side. It was a plain profile with a number stamped on the bow. Any enterprising young fellow with an hour to kill could make one like it out of a standard blank with a nail file.</p>
   <p>“You looked at this money lately?”</p>
   <p>“It’s there. Don’t worry. I got a guy keeping a eye on it. He thinks I got a out-of-town girl friend and this is my weekend duffel.”</p>
   <p>“What if I don’t find her?”</p>
   <p>“Then you keep the dough for yourself. What the hell, better you than them―or the cops.”</p>
   <p>I put the key away. “I’d better go down and take a look at your work. Maybe he’s not dead after all.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t put no dough on it.”</p>
   <p>I left him lying there and let myself back into the hall. It was still empty. I went down the stairs, looked at the mailboxes, went back along the lower hall to a door with a crack of bluish light under it. Behind it a TV blared, applauding its own jokes. I rapped. A heavy voice yelled something. A refrigerator door slammed. Feet clumped. The door flew open and a big man holding a beer can in one fist looked out at me with an expression that was all ready to get belligerent, if it worked out that way. He took a long swallow of the beer, watching me over the rim, and said, “Yeah?”</p>
   <p>He had a broad face, a wide expanse of forehead that didn’t suggest a high IQ, going back to meet thin, no-colored hair. A none too clean undershirt partly covered the pelt on his chest.</p>
   <p>I said, “Manager?”</p>
   <p>“I ain’t his sister.” He took the other half of his beer, crumpled the can in one hand and tossed it behind him. “What’s the graft, chum? You’re interrupting my dinner.”</p>
   <p>“How well do you know your tenants, Mr. Shamey?”</p>
   <p>“As good as I got to. Why?”</p>
   <p>“Apartment 211; occupied?”</p>
   <p>He hooked a thumb in his undershirt strap and leaned against the doorjamb. “Maybe yes―maybe no. Who’s asking?”</p>
   <p>“Shaw. I’m a private cop.”</p>
   <p>“One of them guys.” He turned and walked into the kitchen. I followed him. He kicked the door shut behind me. damping down the blare of the TV. He wrenched the top off a new beer Can, squeezed the contents down his throat.</p>
   <p>“The tenant’s a friend,” I said. “He’s there now. He’s not feeling well. He wouldn’t like to be bothered.”</p>
   <p>Shamey grunted. His little eyes watched me take Anglich’s hundred-dollar bill out of my pocket and unfold it, put it on the linoleum countertop and put an empty beer can on it.</p>
   <p>“He’s willing to pay a reasonable amount for his privacy.”</p>
   <p>He nodded thoughtfully, shrewdly. “A hot boy, huh?”</p>
   <p>“He was in an accident. He got a few bruises. He’s just resting up.”</p>
   <p>“Slug in him?” Shamey stiffened suddenly; his hand made a sudden movement toward his hip, changed its mind, scratched his ribs instead.</p>
   <p>“Maybe you and me better go up,” he said in a flat monotone.</p>
   <p>“Call him on the phone,” I said. “He’ll confirm it.”</p>
   <p>His little blue eyes dug into my face. “I have a tenant croak on me once in a while,” he said softly. “Phone him, you said?”</p>
   <p>He studied my face a little longer, then shrugged. His hand went out and twitched the bill from under the can, whisked it out of sight.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know the guy, never seen him. So he wants to cool off upstairs, that bothers me like a knit doily. But if cops show, it’s their party. Me, I just watch.”</p>
   <p>“I’ll be around to see him from time to time, Mr. Shamey. There might be more money later―if he decides to stay on.”</p>
   <p>Shamey smiled with his lower lip. “Don’t worry about a thing, pal. I ain’t a guy to put a tenant in the grease.”</p>
   <p>He drank the rest of his beer and watched me watching him flatten the can.</p>
   <p>“As long as the pot’s right,” he added.</p>
   <p>“Fine,” I said. “I knew I could count on you.” He followed me out as far as the TV set.</p>
   <p>In the car, I dug a franked post office envelope out of the glove compartment and addressed it to myself. I put the key in it and dropped it in a mailbox at the first corner―one of those big blue and white ones that are placed just right so that you can reach across to them with no more inconvenience than a dislocated elbow.</p>
   <p>Then I headed for Alamitos.</p>
  </section>

    <p>Chapter 8</p>
   </title>
   <p>Alamitos Street, between Seventh and Eighth, was a neon-lit block of cheap clothing stores, pawnshops, mean hotels and suspect drugstores, one-flight-up dance halls and shopworn girly joints that leaked thin, brittle music across the sidewalk. Terry’s Billiard Parlor was a made-over store, a half-frontage on the ground floor of an old three-story walk-up. A sign in a dark window above said rooms to let. It was a nice part of town. I felt right at home there. It was where a man named Anglich had to come to do his drinking in comfort.</p>
   <p>I drove past, went around the block, pulled into the space in front of a curb market that had given up the battle. A wan street light showed me a narrow airspace running back between buildings. I locked the car and walked back through the three-foot-wide passage over a carpet of cans and bottles, came out in a bricked alley. Weeds grew up between the bricks and around corroded garbage cans the city collector had dropped from the route. Off to the right the back of a big signboard occupied a space between buildings. A pair of old-model sedans slumped in the lot beyond it, like abandoned getaway cars.</p>
   <p>Beyond the sign was a wall of dull corrugated steel. A green-enameled reflector with a dead bulb stuck out over a small door. The lights from the other side of the parking lot made a pool of black shadow there.</p>
   <p>I unshipped my fountain-pen flash, played it across knee-high Jimson weeds at the base of the signboard. Some of the tall stems were broken, beaten down flat. They made a trail across toward the door. I switched off the light and stood flat-footed, listening.</p>
   <p>Somewhere a radio twittered, far off a car engine raced, backfiring. A cicada chirred. I didn’t hear any shoe-leather creaking, but that didn’t mean there weren’t six plainclothesmen within twenty feet, waiting for me to get my neck all the way in. I felt the butt of my revolver with my elbow and went forward.</p>
   <p>The door was closed. It opened on a big dark space full of the smell of silence. I eased inside and closed it behind me, listened to my own breathing for a few seconds, then switched on my light.</p>
   <p>The floor was concrete, rough-finished, stained with oil and spilled cargo, littered, dusty. There were a few dark spots against the dust, bright red in the dime-sized spot. I saw foot-prints, drag marks, a small puddle of blood. I flashed the light a little further and found what I was looking for.</p>
   <p>He lay on his side, his knees bent, his hands beside his face. Sallow-skinned, hollow-cheeked, acne-scarred, the thin black hair oiled across his narrow skull slightly mussed, after the biggest adventure of them all. Age, forty-five to fifty. He wore a dark blue suit, white shirt, shiny yellow-brown shoes, badly scuffed across the pointed toes. A red tie was flung gaily over his shoulder. His half-shut eyes glittered with a look of pleased expectancy. like a man on the way to the track with the inside facts. His lower jaw sagged a little, showing the edges of stained yellow teeth.</p>
   <p>I tried to find the artery at the side of his thin, corded neck. His skin was already as chill and clammy as a toad’s.</p>
   <p>Except for a few crates, the rest of the place was empty.</p>
   <p>There was a lot of paper in his pockets: an airline schedule folded open to the New York flights, a receipted, two-day-old bill from the Hotel Tremaine, a sheet from a desk calendar, today’s date, with scribbling on it, the racing section from yesterday’s<emphasis> Tribune,</emphasis> much folded and marked, a movie ticket stub, a pair of Greyhound baggage checks. His wallet contained the usual credit cards, driver’s license, insurance card, all in the name of Arnaldo J. M. Carlotti, of Tampa, Florida.</p>
   <p>I didn’t build too much on that. A lot of people were from Tampa, Florida.</p>
   <p>I got out my wallet and slipped out the thick plastic window I kept for opening spring locks, wiped it clean, and took a set of prints from his right hand. I put his papers back, all but the scribbled one, straightened out his coat the way I’d found it, and backed out of there.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>
    <p>Chapter 9</p>
   </title>
   <p>Back in the car, I used the flash to look over the calendar page. It was a common style; the fact that I’d seen one like it minus today’s page back in Jaster’s office didn’t necessarily tell me anything. The words:<emphasis> Terry’s Bar―Alamitos</emphasis> were written on the back. The scribbling was just scribbling, not even doodling. I held it close to the light, and could see what might have been words written under the scribbling. Or maybe not. I put the paper away and got the traveling bottle out of the glove compartment and took some of my medicine and subjected the data to the searching Shaw scrutiny. Five minutes of that lowered the level in the bottle by an inch. I put the cap back on, patted the bottle and tucked it away, started up and drove back around the block.</p>
   <p>There was a red neon sign―beer―in the window of Terry’s. That and a ten-year accumulation of dust masked the front window. I made the corner and parked, transferred the pistol to my waistband before I got out.</p>
   <p>I had the sidewalk to myself. The light at the corner was a white puff-ball through the mist. I pushed open the door to Terry’s and went in. A stocky man in a dark suit, with a big ring on his right hand, leaned on the bar, which was a plain wooden counter with a green formica top. Behind it, colored lights shone through bottles of cheap blended whisky. Printed cards were tacked on the wall: mail-order jokes about credit and hangovers, and some oversized breasts and hips in photographs. In the back of the room were covered tables, racked cues. It didn’t look like a place that was showing anybody a big profit.</p>
   <p>The barkeep watched me take a stool. The other man looked straight ahead, past me. I ordered beer.</p>
   <p>The barman drew it slowly, turning the glass, cut off the suds with an old table knife, pushed it across.</p>
   <p>I tasted it. It tasted like what somebody had washed the cat in.</p>
   <p>“Arnie around?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“Arnie who?”</p>
   <p>“Arnie Carlotti.”</p>
   <p>“Carlotti, huh? A Spic name. I see lots of Spies. I don’t ask what their names is.”</p>
   <p>“This Carlotti is about forty-five, sallow skin, losing his hair, snappy dresser.”</p>
   <p>“Never seen the bum.” He turned away.</p>
   <p>“Be nice, Shack,” the customer said. “Maybe Shiner could help the gent.”</p>
   <p>I looked at him and smiled. He smiled back. He had thick lips, eyes that were set in deep hollows.</p>
   <p>“Who’s Shiner?” I said.</p>
   <p>“A guy that comes around. They call him Shiner on account of his scalp shines. He got no hair. He knows a lot of answers.” He was still smiling.</p>
   <p>“He around?”</p>
   <p>“I’ll go see.” He straightened, and behind me a glass broke. That was supposed to take my eyes. Instead I slid away from the bar and snapped the .38 out into sight, held it pointed at the floor near the feet of the smiling man.</p>
   <p>“What the hell―” the barkeep blustered. “What is this―a heist? You’re outa luck, pal. The register’s flat.”</p>
   <p>I backed a step to keep both boys in sight and leaned an elbow on the bar. “Polish another glass,” I said. I nodded to the customer, “Let’s be sociable. Come over and take a stool.”</p>
   <p>He didn’t move. I grinned at him.</p>
   <p>“Hell, he won’t shoot,” he said quickly. “Take him, Shack.”</p>
   <p>“Take him yourself,” the barkeep said. His eyes seemed to bulge in his head a little, watching my hand with the gun in it.</p>
   <p>“You got a sawed-off under the bar―” Smiler started, and his hand moved. I snapped the pistol up, hammer back. He stopped with his hand half out from under his arm.</p>
   <p>“What are you waiting for?” the barkeep said. “Now’s your chance, smart guy.”</p>
   <p>The Smiler straightened. “Hell, the guy’s a cop, Shack.”</p>
   <p>“Better throw it down on the floor, Smiler,” I said. He laughed and lifted the gun clear, leaned over and put it on the floor.</p>
   <p>“Now kick it in the corner.”</p>
   <p>He said something that reminded me of Mrs. Prendergast and kicked it away.</p>
   <p>“Now let’s talk about Arnie,” I said. “How long has he been around?”</p>
   <p>“Ask Shiner,” the barman snarled.</p>
   <p>“Fine,” I said. “Where is he?”</p>
   <p>“Clam up, Shack,” the Smiler said. “He’s got nothing―” He stopped talking; in the silence I heard the faint howl of a siren, rising and falling, getting closer. Getting much closer. Rubber squealed from the corner. The siren growled down the scale. A red spot hit the front window, pushed red shadows across the dusty glass, along the wall.</p>
   <p>“Like that, eh?” I said. I poked the gun at the Smiler; he slid aside. I went sideways to the back, to the door I had seen beyond the shrouded tables.</p>
   <p>“Well, tell Arnie I was asking for him,” I said. I let myself out into the alley. Nobody tried to stop me.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>
    <p>Chapter 10</p>
   </title>
   <p>I walked fast along the alley to my car, drove ten blocks, and pulled to the curb in front of a drugstore with big bottles of colored water in the window flanking the camera and sunglass display. Inside, an old rooster with red garters on his sleeves gnashed his plates at me and filled my order for gauze, iodine, adhesive tape, and aspirin. He rang up my money and looked at my left ear.</p>
   <p>“All set?” The words seemed to come from his direction but his lips didn’t move.</p>
   <p>I thought that over. “All set how?”</p>
   <p>He shifted his piercing look to the back of the cash register. “Man oughtn’t to try to do too much doctoring hisself.”</p>
   <p>“I leaned a hip on the counter and folded my arms, gave the place the casual once-over, leaned toward him a little.</p>
   <p>“How do you mean, Dad?”</p>
   <p>He gave the place a once-over of his own, in case I’d missed anything. “Know just the man. Handles a needle real nice. Top man on gunshot wounds. Got a little careless once, was all.”</p>
   <p>“He know how to saw off a leg?”</p>
   <p>The old boy’s head jerked. “How’s that?”</p>
   <p>“Amputations. You know.”</p>
   <p>The druggist’s color didn’t look good. “How bad is this feller hurt, for Gawd’s sake?”</p>
   <p>“Who said he’s hurt? I just don’t like the guy.” He staggered back.</p>
   <p>“Sure, ride me,” he said. “Everybody rides Walt.”</p>
   <p>“Just a routine check, Walt,” I said. “You’ll be hearing from us.”</p>
   <p>I looked back from the sidewalk. He was staring at me over the green bottle like an angry trout.</p>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 11</p>
   </title>
   <p>Shamey stuck his head out and leered as I went past. Upstairs, Anglich was still lying in the same position on the bed. His face was puffed up like a beach ball now, but he seemed a little more alive. He grunted and laid a small automatic pistol on the table beside the rye bottle.</p>
   <p>I lit up a weed and looked at him.</p>
   <p>“His name was Arnaldo Carlotti,” I said. “Never saw him before, eh?”</p>
   <p>“I never see any of the bums before.”</p>
   <p>“Carlotti was from Tampa. That’s your old stamping ground.”</p>
   <p>“You think I know every gun-punk in the state?”</p>
   <p>“It ties in with your idea that your old friends are still interested.”</p>
   <p>“Yah. I already tell you that.”</p>
   <p>“Ever heard of a man named Shiner?”</p>
   <p>“Naw. Who’s he?”</p>
   <p>“He hired the boys who worked you over.”</p>
   <p>Anglich snorted. “Forget about them slobs. You find Anya for me. That’s what I hire you for.”</p>
   <p>“That―and finding the bodies you leave laying around.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah,” he said slowly. “That puts you in bad with the cops if they find out you don’t phone it in. Or―” He tensed up.</p>
   <p>“No, I didn’t report it,” I snarled. “I guess three to one is fair enough odds. That doesn’t mean they won’t find you on their own. They do that occasionally, you know.”</p>
   <p>“Geez, you’re a all right guy, Shaw. Don’t worry, if they catch me I don’t say nothing about you.”</p>
   <p>“Sure,” I said. “Just try to keep your hands to yourself a little more after this. The necks you get hold of nowadays break so easily. You know a man named Jaster?”</p>
   <p>“No.”</p>
   <p>I spent a quarter of an hour with the tape and bandages. When I finished his face looked like a mummy that had come through the mails badly. I told him I’d see him tomorrow and left him nursing his rye bottle.</p>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 12</p>
   </title>
   <p>There were still a few lights on in the Russon Building. I parked across the street and made another try to read the words that might or might not be under the scribbling on the paper from Carlotti’s pocket. I still couldn’t. I went across and rode the car up. The sixth floor was dark and silent. Jaster’s door was locked; there was no light behind it. I tried my stuff with the celluloid: no go. The next door was more cooperative. I stepped inside and looked at the chairs and the dead magazines on the table. A buzzer had sounded when I opened the outer door. I closed it and the buzzing stopped. A little gray light came from the half-open inner door. I flat-footed over and looked through.</p>
   <p>Papers were scattered on the floor and on the desk. Also on the desk was a hand, motionless, palm up, the fingers curled, a color that no live hand ever was. I eased into the room; the face that went with the hand rested with one gray cheek against the blotter. The tip of the tongue showed between lips that were no longer pink. The half-shut eyes glittered at me knowingly.</p>
   <p>I went back and set the latch on the anteroom door, then came back in and put on the small hooded desk light. It made his bald spot look greenish, his fat neck the color of river-bottom clay. There was a soggy hole in the front of his shirt. Between his feet on the linoleum there was a black pool like drained oil.</p>
   <p>The drawers were pulled out, empty. I poked around in the debris, looked under the blotter, in the filing cabinet. No clues jumped out at me. I went over and kicked the safe; the door swung open. Inside was a brown paper bag with Jaster’s lunch in it―that and some dust. I didn’t look inside the sandwich to see if there was a message tucked under the Bologna.</p>
   <p>Jaster had had something that he thought put him in a bargaining position. But the bargain had gone sour, as such bargains will. Maybe I should have played my interview a little differently, talked a little longer. At the time I had had the feeling Jaster would soften up if he was left alone with his thoughts for a while. He looked like a man who would have that kind of thoughts.</p>
   <p>Whatever he had had, he hadn’t left it lying around for me to find.</p>
   <p>I started to leave and veered over to the desk and looked at the calendar pad. There was nothing on the top sheet except some of the Jaster scribbling. I leafed back a few days. All the sheets were scribbled. Several of them were missing. I took another minute to check the pudgy man’s pockets. They were clean. I almost missed the scrap of paper on the floor. Just a corner showed under his shoe. I slid it out. It was Sunday’s page from the calendar, folded twice. An address was written on it: 2056 Orlando Way, just legible under the black marks.</p>
   <p>I put the light off, wiped the doorknobs, let myself out into the hall and left the door locked behind me.</p>

    <p>Chapter 13</p>
   </title>
   <p>Orlando Way was on the shabbier side of Sunset, a street full of those cereal-box prefabs they sold just after the war. It hadn’t looked good when it was new, and nobody that had lived there had ever gone to any trouble to try to ritz the neighbors. Twenty fifty-six had a small front porch that probably wasn’t part of the original package; the ends of real two-by-fours showed under warped decking above concrete block foundations. A broken front walk led up between squares of hard brown turf full of sickly dandelions. I drove on half a block and parked the Olds under a durable-looking palm tree and walked back.</p>
   <p>The porch was empty. I rapped on a rusted-out screen door that rattled when I touched it. The roller shade on the window to my left twitched, then dropped back. The door creaked open and a small, pinch-faced woman in a dowdy housecoat peered out at me through the black screen. Behind her I could see new mail order furniture and bargain carpeting, a kerosene floor furnace in a narrow hall.</p>
   <p>I said, “Good evening, ma’am. I’d like to talk to you for a few minutes on a business matter.”</p>
   <p>She made a vague sound and whined, “We ain’t buying nothing, mister.” But she didn’t move.</p>
   <p>“It’s a matter Mr. Jaster may have spoken to you about,” I said. Her eyes jumped; her face sagged sideways.</p>
   <p>“We don’t know nobody like that,” she said in a breathless rush.</p>
   <p>“Is your husband at home?”</p>
   <p>Her eyes jumped again. I moved toward her and she gave ground. Behind her a voice said tiredly, “Ah, hell, let him in, Mae.”</p>
   <p>The room was hot, small, untidy. A heavy-bodied round-shouldered man in a flannel shirt that was a size too big and too heavy for the season was sitting on a brown plush divan with worn patches on the arms that didn’t match the rest of the room. A ten-gauge shotgun lay across his lap; it wasn’t aimed at me, but it could be in a hurry. His finger was curled carelessly close to the trigger. There was a greasy patch on the flowered wallpaper above the back of the divan behind his head. The house stank of cabbage and careless housekeeping.</p>
   <p>“What was this about a―Mr. Jester, did you say?” he squinted his eyes at me as if he was used to talking through cigarette smoke. There was sweat on his upper hp.</p>
   <p>“If you don’t know him, what does it matter?” I said.</p>
   <p>“You ain’t drove all the way out here to Brentwood just to talk smart,” he said. “Sit down―over there.”</p>
   <p>“Fred’s just . . . cleaning his gun,” the woman said in a ratchety voice.</p>
   <p>“That’s right,” Fred said. “I’m cleaning my gun. And I’ll clean it right into your vest if you get fancy, mister. Sit down―like I said.”</p>
   <p>I sat. A broken spring poked me in the haunch. I watched the gun and wondered how far into my draw I could get before he got the muzzle around in line with my navel. Not far enough, I decided.</p>
   <p>“I asked you, what’s this about Jaster?” He knew his name now.</p>
   <p>“He couldn’t make it. I came instead.”</p>
   <p>He thought that over while I listened to the woman making snuffling sounds from her end of the room.</p>
   <p>“If I knew what you was talking about―and I ain’t saying I do―why ain’t he here hisself?”</p>
   <p>“He had to stick around the office.”</p>
   <p>“And who are you?”</p>
   <p>“Shaw. We haven’t met.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah? Maybe you better stand up at that, mister.” He shifted the gun a little more in my direction. I stood and he came to his feet. Standing, he didn’t look as big; his legs were short and bowed in baggy khaki pants.</p>
   <p>“Mae, check him over. Let’s see who he is.”</p>
   <p>The woman made a thin sound, like a chicken bone in the throat, strangling, and skittered down the hall into the back room and slammed the door. The man paid no attention to this at all. He moved in, shifted the gun to his right hand, and said, “Get them hands up high.” I followed instructions. He reached for me, maybe with the idea of patting me down the sides the way it’s done in the movies. I grabbed his wrist and yanked hard and kicked the shotgun out of his hand. He swore and tried to use his heel on my shins, and I hit him beside the ear. His eyes went glassy. I stepped back and let him go down on his face. All this made hardly any noise at all. I got his wallet and sat in the chair and rested my gun on my knee and mopped my face off with a handkerchief before I opened the wallet. There was a driver’s license, some expired credit cards, a union card, other junk, all made out in the name of Frederik A. Conroy.</p>
   <p>While I was doing this Conroy was stirring around and groaning in a halfhearted way. He rolled over and sat up, looked around and stared at my knees. He grunted, made heavy work of getting to his feet and over to his divan. He kicked the shotgun away and rubbed a pale, spotty hand over his jaw.</p>
   <p>“Brother, you sock,” he said blurrily. “What’s it about?”</p>
   <p>“Anya,” I said.</p>
   <p>He nodded and tried his jaw to see if it still worked. “I been through all that with A.P. I got nothing to add.”</p>
   <p>“Go over it again―in case A.P. left something out.”</p>
   <p>He narrowed his eyes down. “Where you know A.P.?”</p>
   <p>“Where do you think?”</p>
   <p>“I ain’t thinking.”</p>
   <p>“We’re wasting time, Conroy,” I said. “Where’s the girl?”</p>
   <p>That was the wrong question. His face changed, got tight and crafty and scared. “Wait a minute, mister,” he said. “What you pushing at me? I don’t know what you’re talking about. What you doing in my house, anyway?”</p>
   <p>“You brought her out here in ‘forty-two or ‘forty-three,” I said. “I guess it was a legal adoption. How long did she stay with you?”</p>
   <p>“You got the wrong party, mister.”</p>
   <p>“She’d be in her late twenties now. How long since you saw her last?”</p>
   <p>His eyes brooded on me. “You ain’t no friend of A.P. Where you get my name?”</p>
   <p>“The point is I got it. Do you want to talk to me or would you rather do your talking down at Headquarters?”</p>
   <p>He sat up and said, “Huh?” It was a nice covering action.</p>
   <p>I heard the sound behind me―too late. The woman was standing in the hall holding a .44 hogleg with both hands, aimed at my head. She came forward quickly, her back curved, her eyes flicking from me to Conroy.</p>
   <p>“Get his gun, Fred,” she whispered.</p>
   <p>“Aw, for cripe’s sake, Mae,” he said, and didn’t move. I got up and she put the gun in my face and strained at the trigger. I took it out of her hands. The safety was on, rusted on. She wailed and put the back of her hand against her mouth.</p>
   <p>Conroy was looking at me, almost grinning.</p>
   <p>“Naw―you ain’t no cop. A cop would have put three slugs in her before he thought to check the safety.” He made a pushing away motion. “Hell, we got nothing to hide. Not after all this time. Me and Mae give up the kid right after we come West. Working them late shifts and overtime, sleeping days. And we was drinking some. No life for a kid. So . . . “ He threw out his hands and forgave himself with a smile. “We let her go.”</p>
   <p>“Where?”</p>
   <p>“Lessee―Mae called up the home and they come and got her. Ain’t that right, Mae?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah,” Mae said in a dead voice. “Sure.”</p>
   <p>I fished the picture of Prendergast out of my inside pocket and held it for Conroy to look at.</p>
   <p>He tried to grin, frowned, then gave up and let his face fall apart like a bride’s piecrust. Mae wailed again and flopped down in a chair.</p>
   <p>“Rings a bell, eh?” I said. “Tell me about it.”</p>
   <p>Conroy shook his head. He looked like a sick man.</p>
   <p>“We done nothing,” he croaked in a broken, old man’s voice. “God help us, we done nothing.”</p>
   <p>“Threw a scare into you, eh? Why?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know nothing. I never seen him before.”</p>
   <p>“You’re overplaying it, Conroy. He’s been dead two years. I want to know what your deal was.”</p>
   <p>His mouth opened and shut. “Oh,” he said. “Yeah. Sure. I guess the guy got to me.” He faked a laugh, not successfully. “Must be getting old, nerves shot to hell.”</p>
   <p>“You were telling me about Prendergast.”</p>
   <p>“Aw, look, feller,” Conroy whined. “Why can’t you just go on away and leave us alone? I told you―we don’t know nothing about the girl no more.”</p>
   <p>“Just a quiet, suburban couple enjoying a peaceful evening at home,” I said. “That the picture?”</p>
   <p>“Right, mister. Now why don’t you just take your gun and your big smile right on out of here before I get mad and call in some law?” This in a tone of weak bluster even he didn’t believe in.</p>
   <p>“You always greet visitors with a shotgun?”</p>
   <p>“Like Mae told you―I was cleaning it.” Sullen now. Somehow he’d gotten his confidence back―or a part of it.</p>
   <p>“Who were you expecting?”</p>
   <p>The woman made one of her sounds. Conroy sneered. Maybe he thought it was a placating smile.</p>
   <p>“Look, we don’t want a damn thing, Mae and me; only to be left alone, understand? We don’t want nothing, we don’t know nothing. We done nothing. We’re decent, retired people. We worked hard all our life.” He was working himself up into a little pale righteous rage. “Now you get out, mister!” He jerked a hand toward the door. “Go on―out!”</p>
   <p>“What did you have to do for the furniture money, Fred?”</p>
   <p>“Who told you about that?”</p>
   <p>“He come here,” Mae said suddenly, in a dead voice. “He gave us the money. We didn’t have to do nothing.</p>
   <p>Just keep quiet, was all.” She tittered in a drunken way. “And here we are, talking our fool heads off.”</p>
   <p>“Who do you mean by ‘he,’ Mrs. Conroy?”</p>
   <p>She shuddered and didn’t answer, didn’t look at me.</p>
   <p>“She means Jaster―the lousy skunk,” Conroy said smoothly. “Tried to scare us. Sure, we taken the money. Why not? He said there’d be more later, maybe. But we done nothing wrong―”</p>
   <p>“What was it you were supposed to keep quiet about?”</p>
   <p>Conroy moved his shoulders. “The girl―what do you suppose?”</p>
   <p>“Why?”</p>
   <p>“Curiosity’s for rich folks, mister. Young folks, healthy folks. We could use the money, God knows. You think this place looks pretty plain, maybe. You should of seen it before.” He stopped talking suddenly and looked startled, as if he’d just remembered a cake in the oven.</p>
   <p>“We ain’t never had nothing,” Mae said. “Only for a while there, in the war.” She started to cry silently for a change, into a wadded handkerchief.</p>
   <p>“When did Jaster come around?”</p>
   <p>“Year, year and a half ago,” Fred answered for her. “The first time.”</p>
   <p>“When was the last time?”</p>
   <p>“Not him,” Mae spoke up. “It was―”</p>
   <p>“All right, Mae,” Fred said in a deadly tone he hadn’t used before.―She closed her mouth in mid-word and went back to her hanky. “A few days back,” he went on. “Like I said, he talked mean. Made threats. That’s how come the shotgun.”</p>
   <p>“How did you happen to adopt the child in the first place, Conroy?”</p>
   <p>He gave a short laugh that had all the hearty, spontaneous humor of a death rattle. “Guess you’re thinking we don’t look the type couple to be taking a kid. But we was young then. Hell, we ain’t old now―I’m fifty-five and Mae’s two years younger. You might not think it to look at her, but back then she was a pretty little piece.”</p>
   <p>Mae sobbed.</p>
   <p>“We hadn’t been doing too well, me and Mae. I’ll tell you, to us the war was a godsend. All of a sudden we was making money―good money. Life was good. We knew we’d been wasting it. Now we had a chance. We made up our minds to straighten up, amount to something. We went off the booze. We wanted to make a real home. We couldn’t have no kid. So we adopted one. Cute little rascal, big eyes, helpless; you know. Then we heard about better jobs on the Coast. Feller come around, signed us up right there in Tampa, paid our way out. We felt like life was opening up at last. Then one day this feller come along. Said there’d been a mix-up, we’d got his kid. He wanted her back. Said he knew he had no legal claim, but he’d pay.” Fred paused to wet his lips, his eyes shining at the golden memory. “Ten thousand, cold cash,” he whispered.</p>
   <p>“That’s what we sold her for,” Mae said in a voice that wobbled like a flat wheel.</p>
   <p>“Mae taken it bad,” Fred said. “Went to drinking, letting the house go.” His voice hardened. “Got to taking up with men, cheap spenders in liquor joints. I whipped her―God knows 1 whipped her. It was rough on me too. I went back on the booze. They fired me. Couldn’t hold a job. Got in trouble, got myself arrested.” He wagged his head. “I done six hard months up at Quentin. That cured me.”</p>
   <p>“The man who took her―the one who said he was her father―”</p>
   <p>“I never said he was the father,” Conroy said quickly. “He was the uncle. That’s what he said.”</p>
   <p>“You believed him?”</p>
   <p>“I believed him ten thousand dollars’ worth. Who’d pay that kind of money for a kid wasn’t nothing to them?”</p>
   <p>“What name did he give?”</p>
   <p>Fred looked at me squarely for the first time since he’d started talking. “I plumb forgot,” he said flatly. “And nothing’s going to make me remember any different.”</p>
   <p>“Do you have a picture of her?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, yes,” Mae said. “Right in the hall closet.” She scuttled around my chair and banged the door open, rummaged on the shelf, came back with a smiling studio shot of a weakly pretty woman of about thirty and a round-faced child of perhaps five. The woman could have been Mae, twenty-five years younger. The child was blonde, small featured, nothing like the picture Anglich had showed me. I put the photo in my pocket.</p>
   <p>“And her name was Anya?”</p>
   <p>“Anna,” Mrs. Conroy corrected. “We called her Annie.”</p>
   <p>I stood, trying hard to remember if Jaster had said Anya, or if I had thought he had because that was what I had been expecting to hear. The gun in my hand seemed suddenly as out of place as a fire hose. I put it away.</p>
   <p>“Well, thanks for the talk,” I said, and listened to the words fall into a silence like Bryce Canyon. I let myself out, feeling their eyes on me. My feet were loud on the walk. Somewhere the evening frogs were tuning up, a chorus of derision. I was a real nice fellow. I was proud of myself. I liked knowing me. The sleuth racket was such a lovely life. You got to meet such a nice class of people―and they got to meet you. Well, maybe we deserved each other.</p>
   <p>I cranked up and started back to Hollywood. I got as far as Bundy before I noticed the car behind me.</p>

    <p>Chapter 14</p>
   </title>
   <p>It’s hard to be sure when you’re being tailed. At first I thought he was following me, then I didn’t, then I did again. I turned right onto Shetland, just above San Vicente, right again on Gretna Green. He did too. It was a small gray Volkswagen with a crumpled fender, but that didn’t necessarily mean anything. There were lots of Volkswagens, all of them small, lots of them gray, and a reasonable number with bent fenders. I speeded up and doused my lights and did a few lefts and rights and suddenly there were no more houses, just vacant lots full of sagebrush standing on their edges against a dark skyline. The sound of my engine racketed between the canyon walls. And not just my engine. The buzz of the VW got suddenly louder. Headlights went on in my rearview mirror, overhauling me fast. I put it to the floor and saw the Dead End sign in time to brake to a sliding stop with two wheels in among the manzanita and sage and tin cans. The nose of the VW was practically in my lap; its lights lit up the inside of the Olds like a night club act. They died and doors clacked and two men who were probably too small to be ex-Ram linebackers did a nice enveloping movement. Something black and deadly looking was poking in my open window: the snout of a submachine gun.</p>
   <p>The face behind the gun had been used hard. It hadn’t been pretty to begin with, and the cut under the eye and the bruise that spread along the jaw line and the scabbed lip gave it an expendable look, as if nobody much cared anymore what happened to it. The skin was a sallow tan that hadn’t come from the sun; against it the teeth looked whiter than they were.</p>
   <p>“Out,” a slick, tight voice said.<emphasis> “Vamanos,</emphasis> chum.” It was a Latin accent, but not Mexican. “This is a stick-up, like you hear about. Lift the feet.”</p>
   <p>“You’re just kidding,” I said. “You wouldn’t shoot that thing around here.”</p>
   <p>The muzzle jabbed my cheekbone and the salt sweet taste of blood spread along the edge of my tongue. The passenger side door jerked open and a gaunt face with a complexion like oatmeal and two strips of white tape across the jaw grinned at me over a big Colt revolver. I cut the engine and got out. The Cuban watched my eyes while he lifted my gun and threw it up the slope.</p>
   <p>“In the bus,” he said. The other one came around the front of the Olds and got in the driver’s seat of the VW, closed the door on his side. I got in the back and the Cuban crowded in beside me while his partner held the Colt aimed at my head. When the stutter gun was nicely settled in my ribs the gaunt-faced man put the revolver on the seat beside him and started up, backed, gunned away. I reached up to touch the tender spot on my cheek and the gun jabbed at me.</p>
   <p>“I thought you just wanted my gold elk’s tooth,” I said.</p>
   <p>“You know better, gumshoe. But you might pass over the leather at that.”</p>
   <p>“Nuts. If I reached for it you’d break a rib for me.”</p>
   <p>“Now you’re getting smart. Ain’t the peeper getting smart, Sid?”</p>
   <p>Sid grunted, hunched over the wheel. He did a left at the corner and covered three fast blocks past badly maintained bungalows and used cars parked in weed-grown driveways. The houses got bigger and farther apart. The road curved, rising and falling. We went fast, squealing tires, ripping through ribbons of fog in the hollows. Then we were in the foothills, climbing past fenced estates. There was a smell of the sea and of wild growth. Far away in the valley lights shone like strewn riches.</p>
   <p>“Anywhere here is OK,” the Cuban said. It was the first time anybody had spoken in ten minutes.</p>
   <p>“Not yet,” Sid said. He had a deep, broken voice, like trouble in the gear box. “Where they shot that picture <emphasis>Splendor Love</emphasis> something. That’s the spot.”</p>
   <p>“Sid’s movie crazy,” the Cuban said. “He come out here to break into the acting game. Too bad they don’t make them kind of pictures no more.”</p>
   <p>“I was in a couple pictures,” Sid said over his shoulder. “You ever see<emphasis> They Roll by Night?”</emphasis></p>
   <p>“I don’t think so.”</p>
   <p>“I was what they call a extra person.”</p>
   <p>“The peeper ain’t no movie fan,” the Cuban said. “He’s too busy poking his snoot in.”</p>
   <p>“Errol Flynn used to live up around here,” Sid said. “Geeze, the broads that guy had.”</p>
   <p>“Sid didn’t do so good with the broads either,” the Cuban said. “He’s only good at the one thing.”</p>
   <p>Sid laughed. “A guy got to have a hobby,” he said.</p>
   <p>More minutes went by. We reached the top of a rise. Sid slowed, pulled off on the shoulder under a high rock face, and cut the switch. He got out and stretched, then stood and looked in at me with no particular expression. The gun prodded me. I got out. It was a nice night. The stars shone down unconcernedly. A little breeze moved in the trees, as though it had nothing special to do.</p>
   <p>Beyond a vertical drop on the other side of the road treetops pushed up from a canyon that looked as deep and black as a poisoned well.</p>
   <p>The Cuban cradled the gun in his left arm, turned casually toward me, and rammed a punch at my stomach. It didn’t catch me completely asleep; I half turned fast enough to take some of the impact on my hipbone. He swore in Spanish, then laughed. While this was going on the other fellow had been easing around behind me. He grabbed me and tied up my arms in a grip like a banding machine. The Cuban, still chuckling, took aim and hit me far enough below the belt to make the sky turn bright. Even set for it, it felt like the recoil from a sixteen-inch gun. I spent a minute or two getting my spine uncurled.</p>
   <p>“You’re a pretty tough boy,” I said, and tried not to wheeze. “What happened to your face?”</p>
   <p>He laughed. He had a nice laugh, if you like them a little sinister.</p>
   <p>“Maybe we don’t need to talk to you, shamus,” he said. “Maybe we’d settle for the Hunky.”</p>
   <p>“Seems like we seen you and him together someplace,” the gaunt man said.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, you hadn’t ought to hang out with them kind of guys,” the Cuban said thoughtfully. He put a thumb under my chin and pressed my head back. “Now, where was it we seen you together at?”</p>
   <p>“Don’t you remember?” I said. “We starred in<emphasis> Andy Hardy Meets the Wolf Man.”</emphasis></p>
   <p>“A funny man,” the Cuban said, and rapped me across the face openhanded. “Skip it, peeper. We make the jokes.”</p>
   <p>“We’re wasting time, Rosie,” Sid said. “Squeeze this monkey. Make him sing.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe I did see that picture after all, Sid,” I said. <emphasis>“Frankenstein,</emphasis> wasn’t it? You played the left leg.”</p>
   <p>Rosie snorted and slammed his fist into my ribs.</p>
   <p>“Open up, peeper. Time’s getting short. We got things to do tonight.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t let me keep you,” I said, and got the other side of the hand.</p>
   <p>“What’s the big bimbo to you, small stuff?” the Cuban said, and slapped me half silly. “Where’s he holed up at?” He was warming up to the work now, getting the rhythm. I wasn’t hearing his words anymore, or feeling the blows. It was a big league game and I was the football. I was the track at Santa Anita, and they were running the Preakness on me. They bunched at the turn and there was a bad spill that seemed to go on for a long time and then I was lying on the ground on my back listening to a high humming sound. Somebody was kicking me in the side, just hard enough to make me grunt. I rolled away from that and got to all fours. Don’t ask me why. It just seemed like the thing to do.</p>
   <p>“The peeper likes it,” the Cuban said. “He wants to talk about the Hunky now, on account of he likes it so good.”</p>
   <p>I stood, with no more waste motion than three amputees pitching a tent in a high wind. The ground wanted to sway, but I held it firmly in place with my feet well spraddled. It would have been a good time to keep my mouth shut, but I said, “You must be losing your stuff. Young mothers hit harder than that when they burp the baby.”</p>
   <p>He chewed some air and then stooped swiftly and put the Thompson gun down on a flat rock at the edge of the road.</p>
   <p>“I show you some two-handed work,” he said. I started to slide sideways and the gaunt man made a grab for me. I stamp-kicked him below the knee and turned just in time to catch a haymaker on the side of the head that sent me spinning into orbit.</p>
   <p>This time I was a lot longer swimming up out of it. At least it seemed a lot longer; I didn’t actually look at my watch. There was dirt and bits of grass in my mouth. I lay doggo and listened to them talking. The Cuban was in favor of breaking my arms and legs and rolling me over the side. Sid thought it would be better to take me back to town and squeeze me in private, at leisure. I opened one eye, saw pebbly ground, stiff weeds, the butt of the submachine gun six feet away. The Cuban was standing just beyond it, facing the gaunt man. I couldn’t see his eyes. He might have been watching me like a worm watching a robin―or maybe not. There are risks in any business. It was time for me to take one of mine.</p>
   <p>I snapped my feet under me and lunged. The Cuban was quick. He spun like a cat in mid-air, reached the gun just as my outstretched hand touched it, sent it clattering off the rock. His own grab sent it over the edge. He yelled and threw himself after it. I came up in a groggy charge and bounced off the gaunt man’s knees and dived over the side. Foliage ripped at me. I skidded twenty feet, ricocheted off a tree trunk, did another three yards end over end, and fetched up hard against rock. I lay still―very still. I wasn’t thinking very clearly, but I was thinking clearly enough for that.</p>
   <p>I listened to them snarl at each other while the Cuban beat the brush for his toy. After a while doors slammed and the car went away. I gave it another ten minutes, then started down.</p>
   <p>I came out on a road fifty feet below. It was a twenty-minute hike back to Mulholland. I got a lift with a rabbit-faced fellow in a pickup truck that smelled of chicken manure. If he believed the story I gave him about missing a bus he didn’t say so.</p>
   <p>He dropped me at a cab stand in Beverly Glen. My car was still parked where I’d seen it last. Nobody took a shot at me as I got in. I drove home and took some of my medicine and chewed a couple of aspirin and stuck tape over the cut on my cheek and turned in for one of those long, restful sleeps you read about.</p>

    <p>Chapter 15</p>
   </title>
   <p>There was nothing in the morning paper about Jaster, or about a stiff named Carlotti being found in an unused warehouse off Alamitos. I treated myself to an extra cup of coffee and a long hot shower to take some of the ache out of me.</p>
   <p>It was a little after nine when I shook open the lock on the office door. I sorted the mail into the wastebasket. The envelope with the key was at the bottom of the stack. I put it in the safe along with my gilt-edged securities and opened the alley window to let in the bracing morning smog, firmly rejecting the idea of uncapping the office bottle at such an hour. Well, maybe just one. You deserve it, Shaw.</p>
   <p>I made faces at myself in the mirror over the sink while I rinsed out the glass. The Cuban was a neat worker: no braises showed. The cut on the cheek was mostly on the inside. Under my belt it was a different story. I’d think of Rosie for a week, every time I tucked my shirttail in.</p>
   <p>Back on station with a heel on the desk I dialed the number of police headquarters, told them where to look for a stutter gun, and hung up before the desk sergeant had a chance to get tough. That tired me out. I poured another dram of my cure-all and was just reaching for it when the phone rang.</p>
   <p>“Mr. Shaw,” a cool, unhurried female voice said. “This is Ellen Prendergast. I wonder if I might see you this morning.”</p>
   <p>“You might―if you’re in the right places.” I said.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry about the other morning,” she said sharply. “But you had no right to upset Mother, you know.”</p>
   <p>“Sorry, Miss Prendergast, I had no reason to think what I was going to say to her would upset her.”</p>
   <p>“Just what did you tell her, Mr. Shaw?”</p>
   <p>“Maybe tell is the wrong word. It was more of a question.”</p>
   <p>“What question?”</p>
   <p>“Tell you what: come on down and I’ll ask you the same question.”</p>
   <p>“I have no intention of being interrogated, Mr. Shaw,” she said firmly.</p>
   <p>“What was it you wanted to see me about, Miss Prendergast?”</p>
   <p>“Will you be in your office at one o’clock?”</p>
   <p>“Better make it before lunch. I may feel like a nap.”</p>
   <p>“If you’re trying to prove that you can be very rude, consider the point made. I’ll be there at ten. Good-by.”</p>
   <p>I said good-by to a dial tone and went into a huddle with my bottle. The phone jangled again. It was Lacey, from the sheriff’s office.</p>
   <p>“Hiya, kid,” he said. “How’s the private war on crime?”</p>
   <p>“You sound too cheerful for a cop,” I told him. “You must not know all the facts.”</p>
   <p>“Ain’t it the truth, boy?” he said, and yawned into the phone. “Say, you do any good for that Lou Anglich I sent around?”</p>
   <p>“Not much. He’s counting clouds if he thinks I can pick up a trail twenty-five years old―if there’s any trail to pick up.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah―well, I figured you could make an honest buck letting him down easy. By the way, where’s he staying?”</p>
   <p>“He said he’d call me.”</p>
   <p>Lacey sighed.</p>
   <p>“Sure. Well, let me know if he rings in.”</p>
   <p>“Check.”</p>
   <p>“Well, keep the nose clean, boy. Oh―I almost forgot. The L.A. prowlies answered a squeal last night and got to poking around and turned up a stiff. An out-of-town hot rod name of Carlotti from Tampa, same as Anglich. Coincidence, huh?”</p>
   <p>“It’s a big town.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, I should of thought of that.”</p>
   <p>I hung up and started to pour and suddenly the smell of the stuff was gagging. I put it away and thought about ham and eggs, but that wasn’t what I wanted either. I dug an old brier out of the drawer and stuffed it and lit it. It tasted like shaved caribou antler. I knocked it out in the ash tray and the outer office buzzer sounded. There was the usual pause, then a sharp nose poked around the edge of the connecting door and a sharp face followed it. Sharp eyes probed the corners of the room, the ceiling, the wastebasket, came to rest on my feet, propped on the desk. He came on into the room, a birdlike little man on the arthritic side of fifty in a pinkish tan suit that was neat if not too clean. His yellowish shirt was bunched at the collar by a tie that hadn’t quite made up its mind to be purple. His shoes were a tawny ocher, a little curled but brightly polished. He held a brown woven-straw hat with a paisley band in both hands, as if he was getting ready to take a bite out of the brim.</p>
   <p>I watched him come across the room. He slapped the hat on his knees and sat down without waiting to be asked, not forgetting to hoist the cuffs a bit to save the crease. He leaned forward and crossed his legs, laced his hands over a chest like a starved sparrow’s, and said, “Heard from Jaster lately?” He still hadn’t looked at me higher than the ankles.</p>
   <p>“Who’s he?”</p>
   <p>He nodded and smiled comfortably, flicked a look past my face, got interested in last year’s calendar on the wall behind me.</p>
   <p>“We used to do a little business together,” he said in a reminiscent tone. “A.P. was a guy to know the angles―or thought he did.” He opened the corner of his mouth and wagged his head and made a sound like a ripe fruit hitting the pavement. I didn’t say anything. My caller gave me the benefit of another fast glance. He uncrossed his legs and crossed them the other way.</p>
   <p>“There’s some loose ends,” he said. I waited. He uncrossed his legs and crossed them back the way they’d been in the first place. He looked down at the edge of the desk and let his look travel across and climb my shirt as far as my chin. He leaned forward and spoke to my chin:</p>
   <p>“You know about the bump.”</p>
   <p>“What was that name again?” I said. He didn’t act as if he heard me.</p>
   <p>“Like I said, I’m winding up his affairs. As a favor to a former associate, like.”</p>
   <p>“Wouldn’t he love that―if he knew.”</p>
   <p>“There was a memo on the material you developed for him,” he said solemnly. “I’ll take it now.”</p>
   <p>I said, “Yeah?” and picked up the letter opener and poked my thumb with it. It hurt. I tossed it back on the blotter.</p>
   <p>“What was it?” he said. “Fifty bucks?” He made a tentative motion as if to reach for a wallet inside his coat, watching my ear attentively.</p>
   <p>“What do I do for the fifty?”</p>
   <p>“Turn over what you got,” he said quickly.</p>
   <p>“On what?”</p>
   <p>He thought that over; his eyes checked the corners of the room, came back to my chin. He looked a little hurt, like a drama coach listening to the star pupil fluff a line.</p>
   <p>“You got wrong ideas,” he said. “I don’t mess around, Shaw. I got no time for the games.”</p>
   <p>I fingered my ribs and ran my tongue along the gash on the inside of my cheek.</p>
   <p>“You know a Cuban named Rosie?”</p>
   <p>His head jerked and he almost looked at me. One of his eyes was slightly out of line, with a blurry pupil.</p>
   <p>“He’s teamed with a worker named Sid,” I told him. “Nice fellows. You’d like them. What was your name again?”</p>
   <p>He came out of the chair as if I’d just shunted a couple of hundred volts through it. His lips were curled back from his teeth.</p>
   <p>“Wise guy,” he said, and had to stop to swallow. “I’m representing my client, see? Don’t try to make anything more of it.” He backed toward the door.</p>
   <p>“Aren’t you going to leave a card?” I said. “Suppose I want to call you?”</p>
   <p>“Forget it,” he said emphatically, and made a downward swipe with his hand. “To me it’s routine, I’m trynna clean up some loose ends for a pal. So you don’t want to cooperate, so OK. No hard feelings.” He started his fade around the edge of the door.</p>
   <p>“You can leave the fifty bucks with the girl in the outer office,” I said.</p>
   <p>“What fifty bucks?”</p>
   <p>“That’s the wrong line. You should have said, ‘what girl?’ ”</p>
   <p>He made a noise like skinning a snake and left at a trot. I picked up the dead pipe and poked it around in my jaw and wondered who he was and where he fitted into the picture, if there was a picture.</p>
   <p>All the interview had told me was that Rosie and Sid hadn’t worked for Jaster―or if they did. the little man didn’t know it. But he knew them and was smart enough to be scared of them. Which left the question of who they did work for. Somehow I didn’t see them in business for themselves. Maybe I should have lifted him by the heels and shaken some facts out of him. Somehow the idea didn’t excite me. I felt filled with a vast inertia. I thought about Anglich parked in his hotel room, taped to the eyes. I thought about the elderly Mrs. Prendergast and her winning way with a hard-working snooper. I spared a couple of thoughts for a man named Jaster, scuffling for the next dirty buck on his way to the morgue. I thought these and other thoughts, none of them elevating. At ten sharp Ellen Prendergast walked in.</p>

    <p>Chapter 16</p>
   </title>
   <p>She looked cool, calm, and unhurried. She was wearing a plain suit in a rough dark blue material that was a remote and very elegant relative of what they bag potatoes in. There was a froth of white lace at her throat. Her hair was swept down in a smooth curve over her forehead and fixed with a little black bow in front. I climbed out of my chair while she pulled off a Navy blue kid glove and gave the office a quick sweep with her eyes that made me suddenly conscious of a certain amount of dust and a cobweb or two.</p>
   <p>“It’s the cleaning lady’s year off,” I said. “Just a minute while I wipe off a chair.”</p>
   <p>“Please don’t be offensive, Mr. Shaw,” she said in a soft voice, and sat down quickly on the edge of my guest chair. “I didn’t come here to fight with you.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, I’ll bet you’d be willing to go a couple of rounds,” I said, and leered across the curled blotter at her. She stared steadily back at me.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know why you’re putting on this ridiculous act, Mr. Shaw. Is it supposed to have some particular effect on me?”</p>
   <p>“Doesn’t it?”</p>
   <p>“I’ve apologized for being angry with you. Do you really dislike me so much?”</p>
   <p>I looked at her and then past her out the window at the brick wall I used for a view. I sat up straight in my chair and said, “Let’s take it again from the top. My apologies, Miss Prendergast. In what way can I be of service?”</p>
   <p>She gave me a carefully measured smile and took off the other glove. Maybe that meant she was staying.</p>
   <p>“There’s really nothing. It’s just that . . . things are difficult at home now, for everyone. We’ve never really recovered from Daddy’s death. Mother is balanced on a very delicate equilibrium. Even Mianne . . . “ She frowned a little and nibbled her lip.</p>
   <p>“What about Mianne?” I said it casually, the old family confidant inquiring after the problem sister.</p>
   <p>“She gives the appearance―to a stranger―of being completely self-confident. But inside . . . she’s very sensitive. All this has upset her more than she shows.”</p>
   <p>I wanted to ask her what she meant by “all this,” but instead I nodded and poked in my cold pipe with a paper clip.</p>
   <p>“What I mean, Mr. Shaw, is that anything that interferes with our routine―anything at all―tends to upset the whole household out of all proportion.”</p>
   <p>“So you thought you’d drop around and tell me to go do my sleuthing elsewhere.” I gave her a little twinkle along with the cheery smile.</p>
   <p>“The other day you were showing pictures, asking questions. I don’t know what it is you expect to learn. And it really doesn’t matter. I realize that you have to earn a living―”</p>
   <p>“But why couldn’t I have picked a cleaner racket―like pumping out septic tanks.”</p>
   <p>“I thought we agreed not to be nasty.”</p>
   <p>“Did your mother tell you what we talked about?”</p>
   <p>She turned a little pink around the ears. “I heard a part of it.”</p>
   <p>“Her part or mine?”</p>
   <p>“I told you Mother isn’t well―not herself!” she snapped. “You can’t hold an invalid responsible for . . . for . . . “ She trailed off. She suddenly looked like a very tired and unhappy girl, trying hard to keep it a secret.</p>
   <p>“Sure,” I said, “Let’s go back to where you were telling me to lay off the job.”</p>
   <p>She looked at me coldly. “Someone is paying you, no doubt, to probe into our affairs.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, you have affairs,” I said and looked sappy. I felt sappy. I was riding a girl I hardly knew, and most of what I knew of her I liked. All of a sudden the rye-glow was gone. I shook my head.</p>
   <p>“You know something?” I said. “It’s not you I don’t like, Miss Prendergast.”</p>
   <p>“Really? I’m gratified. I came here to tell you that I’m prepared to compensate you for whatever loss you may incur by sparing us your attentions.” She lifted a crisp little blue bag and snapped it open in a brisk, no-nonsense way. “Would five hundred dollars be about right?”</p>
   <p>“Right for what?” I snarled. “You got a couple bodies you want buried? I get two fifty apiece for strangers. My friends will run you a little more money.”</p>
   <p>She stared at me with her hand poised half in and half out of the purse. “Something’s bothering you,” she said.</p>
   <p>“Who, me?” I yelped. “What would be bothering me? I lead a fine, full life. I get to go out and mingle with the uppercrust, not to mention the lower crust; people I hardly know invite me along on picnics in the foothills; my colleagues consult me regularly for the latest on everything from where to have a boil lanced to the best place to cool down after a murder or two. Cops call me to find out if I’ve hidden any bodies lately. Nickel grifters with terminal halitosis and beautiful mysterious spinsters alike clamor to press money on me. And afterwards I get to go home and stretch out among my first editions and my prize begonias and my Ming chamber pots and plan my next caper. It’s a million laughs, baby, don’t ever doubt it.”</p>
   <p>She took her hand out of her purse and gave me a remote look, like a desk clerk listening to a complaint about slow room service.</p>
   <p>“What do you mean―mysterious?”</p>
   <p>I breathed out. I wouldn’t call it a sigh; I just breathed out. “Don’t count that one,” I said. “It just slipped out.”</p>
   <p>“You needn’t speak to me as though I were one of your . . . your . . . “</p>
   <p>“Go ahead,” I said. “I’m two insults up on you.”</p>
   <p>“And I didn’t come here to insult you, either,” she said, as if finishing a sentence I’d interrupted.</p>
   <p>“Why did you come, Miss Prendergast?”</p>
   <p>“I’ve told you―”</p>
   <p>“You fanned a lot of hot air about the delicate constitutions of the Prendergasts,” I said. “You left out Uncle Frank. How is Uncle Frank? Still keeping a tight rein on the Prendergast fortunes?”</p>
   <p>“What in the world do you mean by that?” she said tightly.</p>
   <p>“Do I mean something by that? Maybe I do, now that you mention it. To tell you the truth I got the feeling Uncle Frank didn’t fit into the scene too well, if you know what I mean.”</p>
   <p>“I haven’t the remotest idea,” she said, with a frost like Scott’s last camp on the ice cap.</p>
   <p>“You get along well with your uncle?”</p>
   <p>“I can’t conceive that it’s even remotely any of your concern, Mr. Shaw.”</p>
   <p>“Still, you’re listening. Maybe there’s something you came here to tell me that you haven’t gotten around to yet.”</p>
   <p>She jumped up. Well, she didn’t really jump; but she stood up pretty fast.</p>
   <p>“I should have known better than to expect you to have any understanding at all of . . . of what . . . “ She stood there frowning at me frowning at her and her unfinished sentence.</p>
   <p>I took a deep breath. “I’d like to understand,” I said. “But I’m not getting a lot of help. I came out to the house and showed a couple of snapshots and asked a couple of nosy questions―and got razzed plenty for it. I haven’t been near the Prendergasts since. If hush was what you wanted you were getting all of it I had to give. Instead of letting it go at that, here you are over on my side of town mentioning a reasonably large sum of money for me to get lost. Tell me how I’m supposed to understand that, Miss Prendergast. I’ll do my best to cooperate.”</p>
   <p>She sat down slowly, as if her knees wouldn’t hold her weight.</p>
   <p>“Uncle Frank said . . . “ She paused and looked thoughtful. “He said you’d been . . . prying into matters. That you were obviously trying to . . . to dig up some dirt. He warned us not to tell you anything.”</p>
   <p>“Did he say just what dirt it was I was digging up?”</p>
   <p>“You speak as though there were actually something . . . discreditable to discover about us. Well, Mr. Shaw, I can assure you―”</p>
   <p>“At the time of your father’s death, Miss Prendergast―where was Uncle Frank?”</p>
   <p>“Why, he was staying with us.”</p>
   <p>“Had he been with you long?”</p>
   <p>“A week or two, I suppose.”</p>
   <p>“Not a year?”</p>
   <p>“Certainly not. He just arrived for a visit from the East. After Daddy’s funeral, he stayed on to help . . . “</p>
   <p>“And stayed and stayed. But I guess his business back East knows how to run itself.”</p>
   <p>“He has no business in the East―as far as I know,” she amended.</p>
   <p>“What does he live on?”</p>
   <p>“He’s quite well off; his funds are invested, of course. Recently he’s complained about the market being bad, and―but I have no intention of discussing my uncle’s financial affairs.”</p>
   <p>“How much is he into you for? The family, I mean.”</p>
   <p>She opened her mouth to be indignant but instead she closed it and gave me a level look. “You’re quite clever, Mr. Shaw. I underestimated you.”</p>
   <p>“How much? Fifty grand? Not less, if I know my Uncle Frank.”</p>
   <p>“I see he was right about your prying.”</p>
   <p>“Just guessing. You see a lot of him as a kid?”</p>
   <p>“He visited quite often, yes. After all, Father’s only brother . . . “</p>
   <p>“Miss Prendergast―is there any doubt that he<emphasis> is</emphasis> your uncle?”</p>
   <p>She looked startled, then smiled vaguely and shook her head. “Not the least in the world. If you’d known Daddy you’d know why. They were very much alike―physically, at least.”</p>
   <p>I opened the desk drawer and got out the photograph of the man in the linen suit and passed it across. “When was this taken, would you say?”</p>
   <p>She studied it, shook her head slowly. “Years ago, of course. During the war, perhaps. Why do you ask?” She handed it back.</p>
   <p>“Do you have any baby pictures of yourself, Miss Prendergast?”</p>
   <p>“No―none at all. Daddy hated cameras. I was sixteen before I had a portrait taken. I remember I was frightened to death.”</p>
   <p>I put away the snap and got out the one of the blonde-haired child. “Then you wouldn’t recognize this?”</p>
   <p>She pursed her lips at the picture and looked up sharply at me.</p>
   <p>“Am I supposed to?”</p>
   <p>“Does it ring a bell?”</p>
   <p>“None whatever. Where did you get it?”</p>
   <p>“I’m afraid that’s privileged information, Miss Prendergast. Could it be your sister?”</p>
   <p>“I suppose it could be almost anyone. Do you mind telling me why you’re asking these questions?”</p>
   <p>I took the picture back. “On behalf of a client. It seems he had a daughter, a long time ago. Now he wants to do something for her. There’s a little money in it. Of course there’d have to be proof.”</p>
   <p>Ellen looked puzzled. “Proof―of what?”</p>
   <p>“That the party in question was the one my client had in mind.”</p>
   <p>“But―this is ridiculous. My parents―”</p>
   <p>“You’ve heard of adoption, Miss Prendergast.”</p>
   <p>Her face went stiff as a jammed lock. “Are you saying . . . that . . . “</p>
   <p>“I’m not saying anything. I’m asking. I take it the answer is no.”</p>
   <p>Some of her color was coming back. “I’ve never heard anything so fantastic,” she said in a rather faint voice.</p>
   <p>“What about Mianne?”</p>
   <p>“Nothing about Mianne! I’ll thank you to leave my sister―and myself―out of your grubby little investigations, Mr. Shaw.” She stood up and grabbed her bag off the desk and glared at me.</p>
   <p>“Sure. Any time you want me to ignore you some more just drop around and remind me.”</p>
   <p>She snorted in a refined way and turned to go. At the door she paused and looked back almost sadly. “I don’t really dislike you, Mr. Shaw. I think perhaps I should―but I don’t.”</p>
   <p>She went on out. I listened to her heels clicking in the corridor until they died away.</p>

    <p>Chapter 17</p>
   </title>
   <p>I paid a buck eighty-five for a mild case of indigestion at the corner beanery and then drove over to Cigale. The Penguin Lounge was a black and white and glass block affair with the slightly seedy look even the best of bars have in broad daylight. The plastic penguin over the deep-set doors looked hot and tired, like I felt. There was a carved screen just inside to confuse the customers. I made it around that into the cool and the dark and groped my way back past a long bar with a padded edge to a table well off the aisle. There were a few early drinkers on hand, just getting settled down to the afternoon’s business. A waiter with a face that had seen everything and liked very little of it came over and took my order for a Bacardi cocktail. The clock over the bar said 2 p.m.</p>
   <p>A plump man in a double-breasted suit with the coat unbuttoned and a hungry little blonde hanging on his arm went back to the jukebox and clacked quarters. The walls trembled and began oozing “Deep Purple.” I was on my third Bacardi when she arrived.</p>
   <p>I watched her come back through the gloom, a big, healthy girl with hair as glossy as a mare’s mane, walking with a self-assured stride, thighs curving the gray skirt, head up, chest out under the fitted gray jacket. She grinned at me and slid into a chair and breathed, “Hi, I’m late.”</p>
   <p>The heads that had turned to watch her turned reluctantly back to what they’d been doing. The waiter almost stepped on his own foot getting over to the table. She gave him the tail end of the smile and ordered a Gibson.</p>
   <p>“I want to apologize again for the other day,” she said. “Mother’s so unpredictable. But she seemed so tranquil, I thought―well, that she’d enjoy a visitor.”</p>
   <p>“I should have listened to Uncle Frank,” I said, “How is the old boy?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, fine.” She seemed to be waiting for me to go on.</p>
   <p>“He and your father must have been pretty close.”</p>
   <p>She looked thoughtful. “Why do you say that, Mr. Shaw?”</p>
   <p>“It’s not every brother who’d step in the way Uncle Frank has.”</p>
   <p>“I suppose not.” She frowned a little. “Its odd―but I never even knew I had an uncle until he came West two years ago. Daddy never spoke of him.”</p>
   <p>I nodded casually. “Did you ever meet a man named Jaster, Miss Prendergast?”</p>
   <p>She shook her head. “No.”</p>
   <p>“Any of your uncle’s old friends from back East ever come around?”</p>
   <p>“Why―no, not that I know of.”</p>
   <p>“What line of work was he in―before he retired, I mean?”</p>
   <p>“I really don’t know. Some sort of investment business, I believe.”</p>
   <p>“Any connection with your father’s shipping lines?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t think so.”</p>
   <p>“There’s a lot of shipping out of Tampa. Your father have any interests there?”</p>
   <p>“I suppose so. He owned shares in many companies.” She smiled and wrinkled her forehead at me. “I don’t see just where all these questions are leading, Mr. Shaw. I agreed to talk to you―I felt I owed you that―but―”</p>
   <p>“I’m just making conversation, Miss Prendergast.”</p>
   <p>“Is there something . . . about Uncle Frank . . . that . . . “</p>
   <p>“You mean did he run away with the buttons off the mayor’s vest? Not as far as I know, Miss Prendergast.”</p>
   <p>She put her hand over mine. It was warm and soft and as provocative as a bare leg under the blanket. “Please―call me Mianne.”</p>
   <p>“I’d better not,” I said. “It might get to be a habit. What would the servants say?”</p>
   <p>She laughed and moved her hand. Mine felt cold and lonely with it gone; I used it to lift my glass for another swallow of my poison.</p>
   <p>“You showed Mother a picture of a child,” she said in the same light tone as the laugh. “Who was it?”</p>
   <p>“She didn’t say.”</p>
   <p>She shook her head. “Mr. Shaw, you’re a tease. What made you show it to her?”</p>
   <p>“I thought perhaps she could identify it.”</p>
   <p>“And the other picture―the one of Daddy. Was there supposed to be some connection?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t really know that either, Miss Prendergast. I’m just a fellow groping in the dark, as usual.”</p>
   <p>“Groping for what, Mr. Shaw?”</p>
   <p>“Have you ever been in Florida, Miss Prendergast?”</p>
   <p>“Never. I prefer Mexico. I have a little house there, at San Miguel de Allende.” She was still smiling nicely, but her voice had taken on a touch of remoteness, like a credit manager hearing there’d be a slight delay in the next installment.</p>
   <p>“Do you mind telling me why you’re prying, Mr. Shaw?”</p>
   <p>“I have a client, Miss Prendergast. He came to me with a problem. A legitimate problem, it seemed to me. I’m trying to help him with it. So far I haven’t gotten much of anywhere.”</p>
   <p>“But―what does this client’s problem have to do with the Prendergast family?”</p>
   <p>“When I know that, maybe his problem will be solved.”</p>
   <p>“That sounds rather ominous, somehow.”</p>
   <p>“Why should it? The Prendergast family are all fine people, aren’t they? There’s the invalid mother and the two charming―and unmarried―daughters. And the hired man. And of course, there’s Uncle Frank.”</p>
   <p>“Do I get the impression you don’t like Uncle Frank?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t like him, I don’t dislike him, Miss Prendergast. I hardly know the man.”</p>
   <p>“Surely you don’t think . . . ?” She crinkled her nose at me; the tone was light, but her eyes watched me over the rim of the glass.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know anything that would send him to jail, Miss Prendergast. Should I?”</p>
   <p>The smile faded just a trifle. “Don’t be offensive, please, Mr. Shaw. It’s not at all necessary.”</p>
   <p>“How should I be, Miss Prendergast? Here I am, a hardened old gumshoe, scuffling to get a crop out of some pretty barren ground; and here you are, as luscious a peach as ever hung out of reach. I like sitting here looking at you, and I like having you pat my hand; but I’m not kidding myself there’s a big future in our relationship.”</p>
   <p>She arched her eyebrows and did something to her eyes that seemed to make the pupils get big and dark. “Where did you ever get the idea that younger women didn’t like tall, tough men with cool gray eyes?” she said in a husky, low voice. “A man’s face is never really beautiful until it has some experience behind it.”</p>
   <p>“Is that what you came out to tell me today?”</p>
   <p>“Why shouldn’t it be―Joe? I’m over twenty-one―well over. I’m single, with no ties. Is there some reason I shouldn’t meet you―for personal reasons?”</p>
   <p>“What about my wife and four kids in Azusa?”</p>
   <p>She shook her head chidingly. “Not Azusa. Hollywood. The Cheshire, on Fountain. No wife, no children, no pets allowed. Are you a misanthropist, Joe Shaw?”</p>
   <p>“You’ve been doing a little snooping on your own.”</p>
   <p>“You have a patent on it, Mr. Shaw?” All this patter still with the intimate little smile, the smile that said the words didn’t matter, that what we had between us surmounted the barrier of language.</p>
   <p>“Why haven’t you married, Mianne?”</p>
   <p>A casual wave of that soft, deft hand. “Why buy a bull,” she murmured, “when beef’s so cheap?”</p>
   <p>“Uh-uh,” I said. “Out of character. You should have said, ‘The right man hasn’t asked me.’”</p>
   <p>“You’re blushing, Mr. Shaw. Do I shock you?”</p>
   <p>“I’ve heard about the sexual revolution,” I said. “I still think chasing them down is half the fun.”</p>
   <p>“And I preempted your masculine prerogative by making the first pass. Tsk.” She flicked a slim finger playfully at my chin. “It won’t happen again.”</p>
   <p>“Seen Ellen lately?” I said. She paused, all over, like a stop-action film clip. Then her hand finished its wave. She sipped her drink, put it back, centering it carefully on the coaster.</p>
   <p>“At breakfast. Why? Or is that an undiplomatic question?”</p>
   <p>“Just wondering. Nice girl, Miss Ellen. Who’s the adopted one, you or her?”</p>
   <p>She tilted her head, like a robin listening for a worm. “The . . . ?”</p>
   <p>“Adopted. A-d-o-p-t-e-d.”</p>
   <p>“What a curious idea. Is that why you were showing a picture of a child? You don’t think . . . that my father . . . that―”</p>
   <p>“Go ahead, say it. You’re the emancipated girl of today, remember? That your old man fathered a bastard. No, Miss Prendergast. That wasn’t it. But it’s interesting to see the way your mind is running.”</p>
   <p>She looked at me thoughtfully, not to say coldly. Cold was a way Miss Mianne could never be.</p>
   <p>“You’re going out of your way to be unpleasant, Joe. Why? You’re really very nice. Is there something you’re hoping to surprise from me by making me angry with you?”</p>
   <p>“What did you have in mind?”</p>
   <p>She laughed. “I like to see a man who’s good at his work,” she said. “You’re<emphasis> very</emphasis> good. Nothing I’ve said has really affected you, has it?”</p>
   <p>I didn’t answer that one. She didn’t wait for an answer. “Perhaps you think a woman with a healthy body and reasonable looks and youth and adequate money has everything,” she said softly. “You’d be wrong to think that, Joe. Such a woman has perhaps less chance than the average to find what a woman wants. The men I meet are spoiled darlings―or they’re someone else’s rejects, the veterans of half a dozen marital disasters―or they’re jackals, hovering around the edges for the scraps from someone else’s table. Sometimes they’re openly after the money. That kind are almost a relief; at least their motives are uncomplicated. It isn’t often that one meets a man who’s none of these things―a man untarnished and unafraid. I saw that in you. Can you blame me for wanting to warm myself at your fire?” She stood, not hurriedly but with finality.</p>
   <p>“Thank you for the drink, Mr. Shaw.” She moved off, gracefully, regally―giving me plenty of time to hurry after her and stumble over my apologies.</p>
   <p>I didn’t pick up the option. I watched her go―along with the rest of the barflies. A sort of sigh passed over the room after she was gone. In the silence the laugh of the little blonde scraped like a fingernail on a blackboard.</p>
   <p>It had been an interesting day with the Prendergast girls. Miss Ellen had come along to the office and asked me to go play on another corner. Miss Mianne had staged her play more artfully, with due attention to fighting and background music. But the messages had been the same: Lay off, Mr. Shaw. Get interested in something else.</p>
   <p>I dug my picture gallery out of an inside pocket and lined them on the edge of the table: Little Anya, with her button nose and solemn black eyes. Little Annie, all blonde curls and innocence. And the young Harvey Prendergast, standing against the high board fence.</p>
   <p>Something caught my eye. I blinked and it was still there. Or maybe not. Maybe it was just the light. Or my imagination.</p>
   <p>I finished my rum and went out on the hot, bare sidewalk and took another look at the photo. It still said the same thing.</p>
   <p>The afternoon seemed to be waiting for something to happen. I got in my car and headed for Mayfair Heights.</p>

    <p>Chapter 18</p>
   </title>
   <p>The gardener wasn’t on duty today. The Jag and the Caddie were out visiting somewhere. The house had that still look that houses get when nobody’s home. I parked in the same spot as last time and used the same flagstones to get to the front door. As I reached for the bell I saw that the door was standing open half an inch. I pressed the button anyway, and heard some chimes go off in the middle distance. I gave it half a minute and dinged the chimes again. Nobody came hurrying to give me the swift brush. I leaned on the door sort of accidentally and it swung open a foot or so. That gave me a view of the front hall with the paintings. Without much intention on my part I was sliding in past the edge of the door. Light filtered down from some stained-glass strips above dark wood paneling. To the right an open archway gave on a vista of pale blue and fawn oriental rug. A similar arch on the left showed me books on dark shelves. Sixty seconds of standing with my ear fine-tuned netted me a minute’s worth of silence. I looked along the hall and thought about backing quietly out the way I’d come in, but somehow my feet started along toward the back of the house.</p>
   <p>Halfway back, the hall widened for the staircase that swept down from the right. The white handrail glowed in the dimness. At the foot of the steps a heap of chiffon lay like a discarded gown dropped by Cinderella on her way home from the ball. Except that this gown still had somebody in it. Somebody hardly big enough to disturb the graceful folds of the cloth. Somebody with a face like yesterday’s gardenias, the coiffure still unmussed. The pale violet eyes were half open, the bloodless mouth almost smiling, like someone hearing a faint song from long ago.</p>
   <p>I let out a long breath and snaked the Luger out from under my arm and did some more of my listening. Upstairs a board creaked. Then more silence. I went around the body on the floor and put a foot on the blue runner and the step creaked under my foot. That made two creaks, one mine and one the other fellow’s. Or maybe not. Old frame houses creak a lot, even without murderers sneaking around in them. I went up gun first, leaning sideways to look up the stairs ahead of me. On the landing I rested and filtered some more dead air for nonexistent noises. Down below, Mrs. Prendergast lay, looking no bigger than a dropped handkerchief. I tried hard to remember whether anyone had said she was bedridden. Maybe I’d just assumed it. Maybe she’d started down the stairs for a stroll in the garden and fallen all by herself. But I couldn’t see her being by herself. There hadn’t been enough vitality left in that fragile frame to light a flashlight. She’d have had a nurse to hold her arm and help her over the rough spots: careful, Mrs. P., take it easy, Mrs. P., now let’s just sit here in the sun awhile and rest, shall we, Mrs. P.?</p>
   <p>But there was nobody with her now. She’d taken that last trip all alone―or had she? Maybe the nurse had just stepped out for an afternoon paper or a fresh carton of weeds, and would be back any minute to get hysterical and scream for the police and swear she’d seen me climbing the trellis on her way out and had thought nothing of it at the time.</p>
   <p>Nuts. It didn’t make sense. Ambulatory or otherwise, the lady wouldn’t have been alone in the house. Ergo, the hypothetical companion had lost his or her head and run from the scene of the accident―or it hadn’t been an accident.</p>
   <p>You’re doing great, Shaw. The situation is yielding to the incisive Shaw analysis. Either she was alone or with somebody. We’ve established that much. Anything more you’d like to know before you shove off for the office?</p>
   <p>Upstairs a board creaked. I got a good grip on my back teeth and went up.</p>
   <p>Nobody shot at me. I went along a wide corridor carpeted in blue to match the stairs. The tables at each side of the hall had fresh gladiolus in tall pale blue pots. The doors on either side of the tables were closed. The second door on the right was Mrs. Prendergast’s room. For some reason, that seemed to be the place to look. I soft-footed along to it, put an ear against it, heard my pulse whispering back at me. I tried the big polished brass knob; it turned; I threw the door back and came through in a rush. Still no shot. Two balls, no strikes. So far just the one hit in the ball game―over the fence and out of the park.</p>
   <p>The big bed was a little mussed, the coverlet turned back, a slight depression in the big pillows. I went over and touched them. Not warm, not cold. Nothing in that for you, Shaw.</p>
   <p>Nothing in the room seemed to be disarranged. There were plenty of drawers and closets for an enterprising detective to poke through, if he had a few hours to kill. I settled for opening the closet doors. Nobody jumped out at me from among the frilled negligees and robes. I saw no dresses, no coats, no street shoes. To an acute thinker like me that might mean Mrs. P. didn’t get out much. She’d get out even less, now.</p>
   <p>That wasn’t a nice thought. I didn’t like having it but it was too late now. I got out a handkerchief and wiped my upper lip and the doorknob and went back out in the hall and wiped that knob. Nothing like watching the details. If somebody walked in now there’d be nothing to prove I’d been there except me and my shy smile. I listened for any more creaks that might be getting ready to happen, then went back down the stairs. Mrs. P. was still there. She hadn’t moved.</p>
   <p>Somewhere at the back of the house there was a sharp thump, as if someone had kicked a chair. I felt my lips getting tight over my teeth.</p>
   <p>There was a choice of two routes, left, through the dining room, or straight ahead to a swinging door. I took the direct way, hit the door with my shoulder, crossed six feet of polished tiles, and slammed against a stainless steel counter that ran down the center of the long kitchen. My head bonged a hanging pot. Behind me, somebody moved; I threw myself sideways and something that felt like a barrel stave with a nail in it glanced off my skull and almost tore my ear off. I was down on the tiles trying to loop the loop with my eyes full of pain tears and a fire raging out of control on the side of my head. A low, bouncing grounder into foul territory, Shaw. Feet clattered; or something clattered. I rolled, fetched up against a counter, swam up, and saw a blurry figure outlined against the back door. I blinked hard and the door banged. The counter was between me and it. By the time I made the run around right end and could see a little there was nothing to see except some empty lawn. An engine started up somewhere, maybe next door, backed swiftly with a snarl, gunned off and away. I felt my ear. It was still there, which surprised me. There was quite a bit of blood. It hurt bad enough to make me regret my lunch all over again.</p>
   <p>It took me five minutes to find the cooking sherry on a back shelf. I took a few ounces from the neck and then used some paper towels to make a cold compress for my ear. Some of the fire began to go out of it. There was a little blood on my coat, not much.</p>
   <p>I used the white telephone on the wall beside the swinging door to call the police.</p>

    <p>Chapter 19</p>
   </title>
   <p>They came through the front door and ten feet inside before they stopped and gave the walls, the floor, me, and a hatstand the clammy eye. They weren’t Homicide dicks, just a couple of plainclothes boys from the local substation. One of them was a moose-faced fellow named Pincus whom I’d met once or twice before on similar occasions. He’d bought himself a new hat since then, a little black affair with a one-inch brim that made him look like a lobotomy case. He took it off, exposing a lot of freckled bald dome and slapped it on his leg.</p>
   <p>“You the guy called in?” he said, and shouldered past me. His voice was one that had blown the foam off a lot of beers in its time. He was checking the ceiling now. His partner went on along the hall and said, “Ha! Here’s the stiff, Ed.”</p>
   <p>Pincus put his hat back on and settled it front and rear.</p>
   <p>“You got to excuse Gunwal,” he said, and grinned. “He’s still kind of new on the job. Let’s go back.”</p>
   <p>We walked back to where Gunwal was staring down at the body. That made three of us staring down at the body.</p>
   <p>“You know her?” Pincus said.</p>
   <p>“Mrs. Prendergast. The widow of―”</p>
   <p>“Skip the bio. I checked the address before we came out. You found her how?”</p>
   <p>“The front door was open. There she was.”</p>
   <p>Gunwal looked back along the hall. “Wait a minute,” he said. “This spot is invisible from the front door.”</p>
   <p>I didn’t say anything. Pincus smiled. It made him look like a sliced pie. “He didn’t say he seen it from the front door, Hal.” He crinkled the smile at me. “You know the Prendergasts pretty good, do you, bub?”</p>
   <p>“I’ve met them.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah. And you come out here today, why?”</p>
   <p>“On a business matter, not a social call―if that’s what you’re getting at.”</p>
   <p>“You surprise me, shamus. Yeah, I know you. I seen you around before with your nose in where it would of been better off out. So you don’t drop around socially to split a pot of tea with the Prendergast family. What business, could a guy ask?”</p>
   <p>“I wanted to see Frank Prendergast.”</p>
   <p>“Hal―you ever heard of any Frank Prendergast?”</p>
   <p>Gunwal twitched his mouth. He had a thin, solemn face and lips that almost met over some neglected teeth. “I think the guy is ribbing us, Ed. Harvey, the old guy was. Or Henry. And there’s a couple daughters. Who’s this Frank?”</p>
   <p>“The brother,” I said. “Of Harvey, not the girls. He was staying here.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, he was, huh? Hal, check that. Still got the ticket for the rod, shamus?”</p>
   <p>I got out my wallet and showed him my permit. He didn’t look at it.</p>
   <p>“OK, so you come out and the door is open and you come in for a little look-see while the folks are away. I’m guessing the folks were away―all but the lady of the house, that is. Right, bub?”</p>
   <p>“That’s the way it looked.”</p>
   <p>“Who’s been gnawing your ear, bub?”</p>
   <p>“I didn’t get a good look.”</p>
   <p>“Tell me about it, pal.”</p>
   <p>“I thought I heard somebody upstairs. I went up, but I didn’t see anybody. When I came back down I heard sounds in the kitchen. I went back there and got beaned from behind.”</p>
   <p>“Not good enough, bub. Not by a country mile. Try it again, and this time leave in all the parts you left out.”</p>
   <p>“I told you what happened, Sergeant. I don’t like it much better than you do―maybe not as much.”</p>
   <p>“Let’s have that description again, you,” Gunwal said roughly. “That’s what you guys are good at, ain’t it? How tall was the guy? What kind of suit? How old? Spit it out, mister. I want details!”</p>
   <p>“OK―here goes. He was six-four in his sock feet, two hundred twenty pounds, red hair going bald, green eyes, a diagonal scar at the left corner of his mouth, and he’ll be fifty-one on his next birthday. And I almost forgot: he was smoking a brier pipe and leading a lobster on a leash―or was that Beaudelaire?”</p>
   <p>Gunwal stared at me. “Hey―that sounds like Chief Walters―all but that crack about the lobster.”</p>
   <p>“Sure, ham it up, cutie,” Pincus said. “Who’s this Beaudelaire?”</p>
   <p>“Ed, I think this smart aleck needs a good punch in the joke box.”</p>
   <p>Pincus gave him a bleak look. “Ain’t you got no respect for the dead lady over there?”</p>
   <p>“You know what I think, Ed? I think Mr. Wiseguy here outsmarted himself.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah?” Pincus looked bored.</p>
   <p>“I heard of guys putting a knot on their own skull to beat a murder rap.”</p>
   <p>Pincus sighed. “Sure―you heard of that. Maybe it even happened once. But did you look at that ear?”</p>
   <p>Gunwal went around to the side and stared at my ear and winced.</p>
   <p>“OK,” Pincus said, “so you come out here, you found the dead woman, tippy-toed upstairs and snooped around, and then poked your head in the back room and somebody tried to knock it off for you. It’s lousy enough to be true. Let’s go look at the place where it happened.”</p>
   <p>I led them back to the kitchen. There were a few blood spots on the floor where I’d been rolling around. They went over and looked out the back door. Pincus sighed again.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, he could of got away through the hedge, easy. By the way, where’s the rest of the family?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know.”</p>
   <p>“Which one you working for, Shaw?”</p>
   <p>“None of them.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah? How come you had business with this Frank Prendergast?”</p>
   <p>“Not really with him; it was peripheral to another matter.”</p>
   <p>“Peripheral?” Gunwal repeated. “What does that mean?”</p>
   <p>“It means it ain’t none of our business. Come on. Let’s frisk the joint.”</p>
   <p>We traipsed upstairs and opened doors and looked into empty rooms. There seemed to be a lot of them. Back downstairs Pincus blew air through his lips and took his hat off and scratched his head and put the hat on again.</p>
   <p>“Everything neat as a coffin,” he said. “Except just the one thing.” He went into the study and used the telephone, came back out and jerked a thumb at me. “OK, bub, you get to ride downtown and sign a statement. Hal, you stick around until the meat wagon gets here just so nobody comes home and trips going upstairs.”</p>
   <p>We took my car. Pincus drove. We rode a few blocks in one of those pregnant silences. Pincus did a left turn against the light and sighed. “I’d like the accident angle real good,” he said sadly. “Except for that ear.”</p>
   <p>“Mrs. Prendergast was an invalid,” I said. “She wouldn’t have been home alone.”</p>
   <p>“She wasn’t―remember?” Pincus said sharply.</p>
   <p>“You see where that leaves us.”</p>
   <p>Pincus sighed again. He groped over the plastic gadgets on the steering wheel, sounded the horn at the car ahead, then cut out around it.</p>
   <p>“How you like this bus?” he asked.</p>
   <p>“The usual piece of junk. That on the level about you not knowing about Frank Prendergast?”</p>
   <p>“I just made a down payment on one just like it,” Pincus said. “Don’t take Hal too serious. He likes to play ‘em under his chin.”</p>
   <p>“Is that why you drove off and left him in charge?”</p>
   <p>He grinned and wrenched the car around another left turn into a tree-shadowed street. “What’s next to the Prendergast place―behind the hedge?”</p>
   <p>“Another hand-groomed acre with a French chateau on it.”</p>
   <p>Pincus frowned; the tires whispered on the smooth pavement.</p>
   <p>“You come along at a bad time―for the one who pushed the old lady. I figure they had unfinished business upstairs. Ordinarily, they’d figure on having maybe all afternoon before the folks come home. Plenty of time to get what they’re after and then rig the body next to the bed, say, like she fell getting up. They didn’t figure on some snoopy private dick waltzing in in the middle. They panic. But maybe they cool off. They take a stake-out down the block and they see us leave. Maybe they decide to chance it.” He showed me a smile like something carved on a pumpkin. “Like it?”</p>
   <p>“The Homicide boys won’t.”</p>
   <p>“Who cares what them hotshots like?” He did another left, which put us north of the Prendergast house, coming up on the street we’d started from. He slowed and pulled across to the left-hand curb, stopped in a pool of leaf-mottled shadow.</p>
   <p>“Let’s go.”</p>
   <p>We got out without slamming any doors, went along the sidewalk under a seven-foot hibiscus hedge. Pincus put his back to it and poked his nose around the corner. He pulled it back in.</p>
   <p>“A green four-door, parked up the block,” he said. “Make it?”</p>
   <p>“It was there when we left. Also when I arrived an hour ago.”</p>
   <p>He grunted and straightened his hat and stepped around the corner. We walked along to the first break in the hedge. Big white wooden gates were latched open on a gravel drive that led up to a car yard in the shadow of three stories of tan limestone under a mansard roof. The hedge beside it was the one that bordered the Prendergast grounds.</p>
   <p>“He could of parked up there for the getaway,” Pincus said. I had my mouth open to ask him if that wouldn’t make the neighbors curious when a car rounded the corner behind us. It was a black two-door Mercury with a man in a snap-brim hat behind the wheel. We watched it roll past and turn in at the Prendergast gate. Pincus’ hand went inside his coat and came out with a short-nosed Police Special. He licked his lips and started forward.</p>
   <p>“Easy,” I said. “You don’t want to shoot<emphasis> him.”</emphasis></p>
   <p>He whirled on me; his eyes were a little wild.</p>
   <p>“That’s Uncle Frank―the one I came to see, remember?”</p>
   <p>“Aw, hell,” he said, and put the gun away. As we reached the gate a carload of Homicide men arrived.</p>
   <p>“I been waiting for you guys,” Pincus said. “This here is the guy turned in the beef. Give ‘em your story, Shaw.”</p>
   <p>I gave them my story. Then we drove downtown.</p>

    <p>Chapter 20</p>
   </title>
   <p>It was late when I got away from there. I stopped by a little place out on Sunset where they didn’t try to drown you in jukebox, to rinse the taste of cop out of my craw. There hadn’t been enough meat to my story to please them. They’d tried to make something out of it, but there wasn’t really enough to work with. A police nurse had even smeared some stuff on my ear and taped it for me. Maybe I was lucky at that. I’d done my duty as a citizen for a change and all it had cost me was an afternoon out of my young life. I ordered rye, drank it, and left.</p>
   <p>I took the long way around to Bell in case anybody was tailing me, and parked up the block from 112. It was a nice late summer evening. Cicadas chirred in the amber twilight. I got out and idled along in front of the closed-down undertaking establishment and smoked a cigarette. No curtains twitched at the window of Lou Anglich’s room. By now he’d probably gotten tired of watching the street. I crossed and went in.</p>
   <p>Shamey popped out of his room like an unshaven gopher out of its hole as soon as I came through the door. He leered at me and brought a cigarette out from behind the doorframe and blew smoke up his nose.</p>
   <p>“In and out, huh?” he grunted. I grunted back and went on up the stairs. A door opened and a woman with a face like a clenched fist gave me a swift glance and disappeared again. Loud television behind her door got louder.</p>
   <p>Anglich didn’t answer my knock. I turned the knob and nudged the door open with my toe. Silence came out of the room. I went in and closed it behind me. The big, rumpled bed was there, and the chair and the rug and the dresser. But no Anglich. Five minutes of poking in empty drawers didn’t change that. A light alligator coat with a tear in one sleeve was hanging on a bent hanger in the closet. The empty rye bottle was on the floor beside the wastebasket, along with some sandwich wrappings. Other than that, the room was bare as a foreclosed bargain basement.</p>
   <p>I stood at the window and looked out at the vapor lamp and the high frame houses across the way and my car up the street, looking small and dusty in the gloaming. Then I went downstairs and rapped on Shamey’s door. It popped open so fast I almost rapped Shamey’s forehead.</p>
   <p>“All right, what’s the beef this time?” he whined, and looked past my ear.</p>
   <p>“When did he go out?”</p>
   <p>“Who?”</p>
   <p>“Try to guess.”</p>
   <p>He made a throwing-away motion. “You think I got time to wet-nurse the tenants, Jack, you get a free think on the house.”</p>
   <p>“I already had it. A hundred bucks’ worth.”</p>
   <p>“Go on―get off my back.” He started to unwind from the doorframe and slide inside; I slammed a foot down on his instep. He made a choked noise and started a swing that got tied up in the close quarters. I stepped in close and hit him hard at the base of the sternum, twice, pushed him back and slid inside and closed the door behind me. He leaned on the back of a big platform rocker and made sounds like a bagpipe undergoing repairs.</p>
   <p>“What was that crack you made as I went up?” I asked him. He helped himself around the chair and sat down and grabbed his beer can off the table and swallowed what was in it and dropped it on the floor without squeezing it.</p>
   <p>“Geeze, fella, you busted something in there,” he said hoarsely. “Get me a beer outa the kitchen.”</p>
   <p>I went around him and leaned on the wall by the kitchen door, facing him, and folded my arms with my hand near the butt of the Luger.</p>
   <p>“In and out, you said. I should have listened closer. Start earning that hundred.”</p>
   <p>He turned a hurt look up at me. “I figured it was you,” he said. “That’s how come I’m surprised to see you back so quick.”</p>
   <p>“Start a little farther back, Shamey. I’m not getting my money’s worth.”</p>
   <p>“A couple hours ago, say four p.m., I hear somebody on the stairs. I’m a little slow getting my head out, I don’t see nobody. I listen. It’s two-eleven; I hear the big guy’s voice. They go inside. I figure it’s you, like I said. Maybe I doze a little after that. The TV is kind of loud. I don’t hear nothing, but I get a kind of feeling. I go up. Nobody home. How about that beer, guy?”</p>
   <p>“Did you check out front? No car?”</p>
   <p>“The street’s empty. If there was a car I would of said. I ain’t holding out nothing. Why would I?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know. Maybe you’d figure to make a few smart bucks playing two hands. Anything in it?”</p>
   <p>“Naw.” He sounded indignant. “Would I do you like that?”</p>
   <p>“What was the other voice like?”</p>
   <p>“All I heard was the big guy. Hell, you can feel him through the floor.”</p>
   <p>“How long was this visitor up there?”</p>
   <p>“Maybe fifteen, twenty minutes. The same show is on when I check the second time.”</p>
   <p>“You think they left together?”</p>
   <p>“I could of slept through one sneak-out. Not two. And you can take my word for it they wasn’t making no noise worth a damn. You spend as long as me keeping a eye on rent-skippers and you develop a ear for the soft-shoe work.”</p>
   <p>“And a nose for the soft buck. How much did they pay you?”</p>
   <p>He rolled an eye up at me. He humped himself out of his chair and went across to a pair of pants hanging across the back of a chair. I watched him root in the pocket. He came across toward me, holding out wadded bills.</p>
   <p>“Here’s what’s left of your C-note,” he said, and dropped it on the floor. “Nobody else paid me nothing. It happened just like I said.” He went into the kitchen and banged the door. I stooped and picked up the money. There was eighty-four dollars. I put sixty in my pocket and tossed the rest on the table and left. Maybe he was lying, but it was a little too late in the day for me to work up a sweat trying to make him tell it any other way. And maybe I reminded myself a little too much of the boys down at Headquarters.</p>
   <p>I went up the stairs and rapped at the door the woman had peeked out of. She’d gotten shy since. I kept on rapping. Then I started kicking, not loud, just a nice, polite kicking, but steady. The bottled-up TV got louder. So did I. The door opened in the middle of a commercial for a canine funeral parlor. The fist-like face glared and some crooked teeth snarled, “Beat it, you.” I got a foot in the door before it could slam.</p>
   <p>“Cops, lady,” I said. “Hear anything from next door this afternoon?”</p>
   <p>“Let’s see the buzzer, flatfoot.’”</p>
   <p>I showed her a sad smile instead. “We don’t carry them anymore, ma’am. They got to causing too many riots. About your neighbor―”</p>
   <p>“I got no neighbor.”</p>
   <p>“The man who was in two-eleven for a few days. He’s gone now. Left about four p.m. I’m asking if you heard any unusual sounds; any conversation, disturbance of any kind.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t stick my nose in. Get your foot outa my door before I ram a broom handle through it.”</p>
   <p>“A shot?” I said, and smiled my crafty smile―the one Pincus taught me.</p>
   <p>Her mouth opened and I got a flash of pink gums. “Shot, huh?” she said vaguely. “Hell, why’nt you say so? Shot, huh? Who done it?”</p>
   <p>“You did hear a shot?”</p>
   <p>“Maybe I did and maybe I didn’t. I’d have to think. Who did you say you was?”</p>
   <p>“A friend of the family. About the shot―’</p>
   <p>“Hell, you ain’t no cop. Beat it, mister, before 1 call my husband.”</p>
   <p>“Where’s he―out in the back yard gnawing an old shoe?”</p>
   <p>“Scram!” she yelled. “I keep my TV turned up loud. 1 wouldn’t hear dynamite if it went off in the hall!”</p>
   <p>I got my foot out just in time for her heel to chip the linoleum where it had been. The slam of the door shook loose dust that had settled from the Thanksgiving parade of 1939.</p>
   <p>Shamey didn’t stick his head out as I left. Maybe the door banging had deadened his keen ear. Or maybe he’d just had enough of Joe Shaw, Private Investigator, for one day. I didn’t blame him. So had I.</p>
   <p>Halfway back to town I thought I saw a gray VW with a crumpled fender three cars back. I did a few lefts and rights and shaded an amber light, and didn’t see it any more.</p>
   <p>I went on home and cops were waiting.</p>

    <p>Chapter 21</p>
   </title>
   <p>There were two of them, Pincus and a small, gray man with a face that looked as if all the juice had been sucked out of it by one of those spiders that sting their prey and take them back to the nest alive for the larvae to feed on. They watched me close the door and switch on a table lamp and turn off the bare ceiling light they’d been sitting under.</p>
   <p>“I’m glad you boys didn’t feel shy about making yourselves comfy,” I said. “Take your shoes off. Have a drink. Act nice and I’ll let you run barefoot through my Persian rugs.”</p>
   <p>“This here is Lieutenant Dreyfus out of Central Homicide,” Pincus said in an important voice. “Him and me come around to ask you a few questions.”</p>
   <p>“No kidding. I thought you just wanted to bask in the sunshine of my personality.” I went past them into the kitchenette and mixed a drink. Then I sneered at myself in the window over the sink and mixed two more. I put them on the lid of a box some misguided admirer had sent me a fruitcake in once―probably a department store that got my name mixed up with a customer―and took them in.</p>
   <p>Pincus started to reach and then frowned and glanced at Dreyfus.</p>
   <p>“Don’t drink it,” I said. “It’s a bribe.”</p>
   <p>Dreyfus twitched a lean jowl and picked up the glass and took a careful sip and put it back.</p>
   <p>“Maybe you’d like to tell me what it was that brought you out to Mayfair Heights this afternoon, Mr. Shaw,” he said, in a voice as light and dry as old wine.</p>
   <p>I sat down and sighed―I was sighing a lot lately―and sampled my drink. It was strong but I could have stood it stronger.</p>
   <p>“It’s just as I stated in my deposition, Lieutenant,” I said. “I had a matter I wanted to discuss with Mr. Frank Prendergast. I went out on the chance I’d catch him at home.”</p>
   <p>“What made you pick that particular time?”</p>
   <p>“It was just a sudden impulse, I guess you’d call it. I could have gone earlier or later.”</p>
   <p>He nodded gravely. “And you’ve said that you were not at that time employed by Mr. Prendergast.”</p>
   <p>“Not at that time or any time.”</p>
   <p>“Nor by any member of the Prendergast family.”</p>
   <p>“That’s correct.”</p>
   <p>“However, you were acting on behalf of a client?”</p>
   <p>“I have a client. In my bumbling way I was working on his problem. But the client has no connection that I know of with Frank Prendergast.”</p>
   <p>“And you decline to give the client’s name.”</p>
   <p>“Lieutenant, I went out there and I found Mrs. Prendergast dead. The milkman might have done the same. Strictly speaking, I should have rung the bell and gone away. I didn’t. I heard sounds. I suspected foul play. Even a private cop is still a citizen. I did what I conceived any responsible citizen ought to do: I tried to apprehend a person I suspected might be the one who helped Mrs. Prendergast downstairs. For my trouble I have a knot on my skull and a ragged ear to remind me a smart cooky would have turned quickly and walked away from there―body or no body.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t suppose it occurred to you to telephone the police and stand by, keeping an eye on the house. That way you might at least have been able to give us a description of the man you say attacked you.” Dreyfus said this mildly, without rancor.</p>
   <p>“The thought never entered my mind. Things happened too fast, maybe. And maybe if it had entered my mind I still would have done what I did. Which side of the house would I watch, Lieutenant? My instinct was to nail the man before he did a fast fade out some side door I didn’t know about.”</p>
   <p>He let that ride and watched the toe of his shoe. Then he said:</p>
   <p>“This client of yours, Mr. Shaw―has he any connection with the Prendergast girls?”</p>
   <p>I took a swallow of my drink, keeping the famous Shaw poker face in position, and thought that over. Nothing in particular occurred to me.</p>
   <p>“May I ask why you ask?” I said carefully. I don’t know why I said it carefully; it just seemed like a good time to start being careful, even in small, unimportant ways.</p>
   <p>“I’d prefer you just answer the question.”</p>
   <p>“No connection―as far as I know.”</p>
   <p>“Any connection you suspect?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t think this is a matter I should make guesses about.”</p>
   <p>Dreyfus looked at his thumb. “A woman’s been killed, Mr. Shaw. At this point we’re all guessing―about a number of things. How a woman in her position happened to be alone in the house; why your assailant was busy upstairs when you arrived; why a private investigator happened along at just that moment. Things like that. Your guesses might help.”</p>
   <p>“What does Uncle Frank say?”</p>
   <p>“Ha,” Pincus said. “That pickled mackerel―” He closed his mouth and frowned and sampled his drink.</p>
   <p>“Mr. Prendergast wasn’t very helpful. He’d been gone less than half an hour. He’d left Mrs. Prendergast asleep. The day nurse had telephoned that she’d be a few minutes late. The daughters were out for the day.”</p>
   <p>“So he left her alone.”</p>
   <p>“She usually slept through until dinner. She hadn’t been out of bed―other than in a wheel chair―for over a year.”</p>
   <p>“So somebody carried her to the stairs and pitched her down. Nice.”</p>
   <p>Dreyfus shook his head. “Her neck was broken first. She was carried down and placed at the foot of the stairs. There were no bruises such as would have resulted from a fall like that.”</p>
   <p>“I guess that takes care of the accident theory.”</p>
   <p>He smiled a wan smile. “Was there one?”</p>
   <p>“Who’d want to kill her?”</p>
   <p>“We checked the will angle,” Pincus said heavily. “Nothing doing there. It’s all tied up in trust funds for the daughters.” He shifted his eyes sideways to me. “Unless you wanted to play with the idea maybe they wasn’t getting to spend it fast enough.”</p>
   <p>“You say you had no other business with the Prender-gasts?” Dreyfus said offhandedly.</p>
   <p>“I didn’t say that. I said none of them had retained me.”</p>
   <p>“Seen any of them lately?”</p>
   <p>“As a matter of fact Ellen Prendergast came by my office this morning,” I said. “Should I have mentioned that sooner?”</p>
   <p>Dreyfus almost smiled at me. “Anything else you should have mentioned sooner?”</p>
   <p>“I saw Mianne Prendergast this afternoon.”</p>
   <p>Dreyfus held his lips like a dressmaker with a mouthful of pins.</p>
   <p>“That would be what time?”</p>
   <p>“At two.”</p>
   <p>“And then?”</p>
   <p>“We had a drink. Then I drove out to Mayfair Heights.”</p>
   <p>“Now let’s see. You saw two members of the Prendergast family. Then you drove to the Prendergast home. But none of this had any necessary connection with whatever it was you were doing on behalf of the client whose name you don’t care to mention.”</p>
   <p>“I didn’t say it had no connection. I said<emphasis> he</emphasis> had no necessary connection.”</p>
   <p>“That’s getting to be a pretty fine distinction, wouldn’t you say, Mr. Shaw?”</p>
   <p>“Look at it this way, Lieutenant. Let’s say you’re a client who comes to me with a problem: I scratch around and get some ideas. I start checking them out. Along the way I fall over a corpse. So I tell the cops to bring you down to the station house and see what they can grill out of you. Like it?”</p>
   <p>He scratched his head delicately with his little finger. Pincus was almost, but not quite holding his breath. He was getting to watch an expert work. It was worth watching. In his quiet way Dreyfus was wrapping me up like a shilling’s worth of fish and chips.</p>
   <p>“You have a right to protect your client―up to a point,” he said reasonably. “The question is, just how far does that obligation carry you?” He gave me a look as flat and hard and colorless as a sidewalk. “I wouldn’t say you were implicated in a murder, Mr. Shaw. I would say your role is still a little unclear to me.”</p>
   <p>“It’s unclear to me too, Lieutenant.”</p>
   <p>He leaned toward me and tapped himself on the knee. “You’re not getting the picture, Mr. Shaw. I don’t have you downtown under the lights. I’m not working you over with the plastic hose and the knuckle-punch to the kidney. I’m not keeping you up all night with the boys throwing the questions at you in relays. I’m asking you―almost politely. The name of the client, Mr. Shaw.”</p>
   <p>I swirled the drink in my glass and drank the rest of it. He waited.</p>
   <p>“You could do all that,” I said. “And other things. I know some of the other things. I’ve had them done to me on occasion. They don’t affect me much. They’re part of the business. If I wanted to hold out on you I wouldn’t have waited around after I phoned in. Maybe I wouldn’t even have phoned in. But I did. Chalk that one up for me. As you said, I have an obligation to my client. That includes not throwing him over the side for the wolves to worry while I make a getaway in the troika. If you’ll give me your word you won’t make any more out of it than there is in it, I’ll tell you his name.”</p>
   <p>“I’m a police officer, Shaw. I’ll do what my best judgment tells me.”</p>
   <p>“Then you can go dig up his name for yourself, Lieutenant. I know you police officers. Sometimes your judgment is just dandy. Other times it’s hard to tell from any other headline-hungry bureaucrat with a yen to get his knuckles in where they’ll draw juice. Try it on me. See what it buys you.”</p>
   <p>“You’re out of line, Shaw,” Pincus barked, and faded a hand back toward his hip. “About a mile and a half out of line.”</p>
   <p>“Go ahead, Porky. Make that snappy hip draw. Show me the braided leather sap with the number-ten shot inside. Maybe you’ll wind up eating it.”</p>
   <p>“How about it, Lieutenant?” Pincus poised on the edge of the chair with a fixed smile on his face.</p>
   <p>“Just a minute,” Dreyfus rapped sharply, and waved Pincus back. “This is getting a little out of hand. I came up here to ask you a question, Shaw. I’m still asking it. You want my assurance your client won’t be unduly hassled. Very well―you have it.”</p>
   <p>“Your word, Lieutenant. The fact that you’re a little reluctant to give it might mean it still means something to you.”</p>
   <p>He flushed a little―or maybe not. “All right―my word on it. I’m not out to persecute innocent citizens.”</p>
   <p>“His name is Louis Anglich.” I spelled it.</p>
   <p>“Address?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know.”</p>
   <p>His look jelled over like setting solder.</p>
   <p>“Until this afternoon he was staying in a rooming house out on Bell Street,” I said. “He checked out. I don’t know where he went.”</p>
   <p>Dreyfus stared at me. Pincus teased his upper lip with the tip of his tongue. Dreyfus nodded abruptly and stood. Pincus looked disappointed and heaved himself out of his chair.</p>
   <p>“Naturally, you’ll let me know as soon as you’ve heard from him,” Dreyfus said tonelessly.</p>
   <p>“Naturally.”</p>
   <p>“Good.” They turned to go; Dreyfus paused with a hand on the doorknob.</p>
   <p>“By the way―I don’t suppose you know where Miss Prendergast was headed after she left your office this morning?”</p>
   <p>“No idea, Lieutenant.”</p>
   <p>“And since she’s not a client you’d have no hesitation in telling me if you did.”</p>
   <p>“I’d tell you if I knew.”</p>
   <p>They left. I took Dreyfus’ drink in the kitchen and poured it down the drain and rinsed Pincus’ glass and mine. I mixed another, not overdoing the water, and took it over to the window and watched the unmarked cop car pull away from where it had parked half a block away. It had started to rain, a fine, wind-driven spatter like the spray on the promenade deck of a ship far from land.</p>
   <p>Miss Ellen Prendergast hadn’t come home. Her mother was dead by misadventure, and the police were interested enough in her movements to dig out someone who’d seen her at the Banshire Building. I could see the way their minds were working.</p>
   <p>“Nuts,” I said to the empty room. I had another drink and went to bed and after a while I slept.</p>

    <p>Chapter 22</p>
   </title>
   <p>Mayfair Heights looked fresh and crisp after the night’s rain. The big houses sparkled in the early sun. The black coupe was at home, looking in need of a wash. The tail end of the El Dorado showed through an open door of the garage. I parked in the drive and went across the grass to the front door and worked the bell. Yesterday I had wanted to talk to Frank Prendergast. I still did.</p>
   <p>He opened the door himself. He was wearing a paisley dressing gown with a black satin collar, not as clean or as new as it might have been, and he hadn’t shaved. The stubble gave him a hint of the raffish look of an elderly panhandler making his first touch of the day. But his handsome head of silver hair looked as perfectly groomed as ever.</p>
   <p>“Butler’s day off?” I said.</p>
   <p>He said, “What?” and looked at me with blank hostility.</p>
   <p>“Miss Ellen at home?”</p>
   <p>“What is it you want―Shaw, isn’t it? I have no time for you today.” He started to close the door.</p>
   <p>“I didn’t mention Thompson to the cops,” I said quickly. He went on closing the door, then opened it again.</p>
   <p>“You said what?” His voice had gone as fiat as leftover beer.</p>
   <p>I got out a cigarette and rolled it around between my fingers.</p>
   <p>“If they’d asked me I would have. But they didn’t. They asked me other things. I didn’t have many answers. They weren’t too pleased with me. How’d you do?”</p>
   <p>“Mr. Shaw, there’s been a death in this house. I’ll thank you to leave us to our grief―”</p>
   <p>“Uh-huh. I was the one that found the body―or didn’t they tell you?”</p>
   <p>“I asked you once what it is you want, Shaw.”</p>
   <p>“But you didn’t wait for an answer. I was thinking we could have a little talk, Mr. Prendergast.”</p>
   <p>“On what conceivable subject?”</p>
   <p>“Yesterday.”</p>
   <p>His eyes went to my bandaged ear. I said, “Why don’t we talk inside?”</p>
   <p>He made an impatient sound and backed inside and I followed him into the library. He settled himself in a chair and motioned me to one. The leather made a soft whooshing sound; I sank down until I was looking out between my knees.</p>
   <p>“All right―what is all this?” Uncle Frank said.</p>
   <p>“I take it that’s Miss Mianne’s car in the garage?”</p>
   <p>“What business is that of yours?”</p>
   <p>“Ellen drives the little gray Jaguar. Still not home, eh?”</p>
   <p>“My family’s activities are none of your concern!”</p>
   <p>“The police seemed to think differently, Mr. Prendergast.”</p>
   <p>“You keep mentioning the police. Is that supposed to secure some sort of reaction from me?”</p>
   <p>“It does from most people. They had the idea I might know where she was.”</p>
   <p>“What’s your interest in my niece, Shaw?”</p>
   <p>“She came by my office yesterday. We had an interesting talk.”</p>
   <p>“And?”</p>
   <p>“And now she seems to have dropped out of sight. That worries me a little.”</p>
   <p>“Haven’t you done enough snooping, Shaw? Yesterday, trespassing here―what do you think gives you the right to rummage in my dead sister-in-law’s room? I could have you arrested for that―”</p>
   <p>“I thought they didn’t tell you I was here.”</p>
   <p>“Well, you’re mistaken.”</p>
   <p>I lit the cigarette I’d been playing with and dropped the match in a Swedish glass ash tray less massive than King Seti’s sarcophagus.</p>
   <p>“Any idea where she is?”</p>
   <p>“At the moment―no.”</p>
   <p>“What are you doing about it?”</p>
   <p>He squeezed the leather arms of the chair and sneered at me and didn’t answer.</p>
   <p>“When she left the house, when did you expect her back?”</p>
   <p>“As it happens, I didn’t see her go.”</p>
   <p>“Did she often spend the night elsewhere without letting someone know?”</p>
   <p>“What are you implying, Shaw?”</p>
   <p>“She’s been gone almost twenty-four hours. Most families would be a bit worried by now.”</p>
   <p>“Naturally, I’m concerned―”</p>
   <p>“There was a small item in the paper this morning about Mrs. Prendergast’s death. Seems she had a fall. That’s the first Ellen would have known of it―unless she had another channel of information.”</p>
   <p>“I haven’t spoken to her since evening before last.”</p>
   <p>“You’d think she’d come home―or at least call―when she learned of the tragedy.”</p>
   <p>“Perhaps she hasn’t seen the paper.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe there’s something you know that I don’t, Mr. Prendergast.”</p>
   <p>He stood up abruptly. “Possibly―and now perhaps you’ll be kind enough to go your way, sir. I’m expected at the mortuary in half an hour.”</p>
   <p>“‘That must give you a funny feeling, Mr. Prendergast. How is Mianne taking this?”</p>
   <p>“You’re insolent, sir! Get out of this house at once!”</p>
   <p>I got to my feet. “Have you thought of calling the police, Mr. Prendergast―about Ellen’s disappearance, I mean?”</p>
   <p>“Certainly not!”</p>
   <p>“Mind telling me why?”</p>
   <p>“I needn’t tell you anything!”</p>
   <p>“You know they’re looking for her.”</p>
   <p>Prendergast’s mouth worked as though there was a mouse inside trying to get out. He walked back to his chair and sat down.</p>
   <p>“I’m . . . making every effort to find her,” he said.</p>
   <p>He slashed his eyes at me, looked away. “Every family has its secrets, Mr. Shaw. This one is no exception. Ellen is . . . erratic. I don’t know what may have set her off. She always resented her mother, resented her illness, the necessity for the constant nursing, the constant attention. There have been incidents before―minor incidents, in the main. I shouldn’t have left her here alone with her, but in God’s name, who would have thought . . . ?” He gave me a sideways look to see how I was taking it.</p>
   <p>“I had to go out―briefly―on a business matter,” he went on. “Marion was asleep. Ellen was in the garden, exercising the dog, running him through those ridiculous commando tricks―as if the beast weren’t savage enough by nature. There was no hint whatever of―” He stopped talking and shook his head, not looking at me.</p>
   <p>“And as soon as you cleared the drive she went inside, dragged her mother out of bed, and threw her down the stairs. That the picture?”</p>
   <p>He nodded once, jerkily. “The poor child isn’t responsible, of course. There are certain officials to whom the matter will have to be presented in the proper light . . . .”</p>
   <p>“You’ll make the right payoff in the right quarter and the case will be dropped, that it?”</p>
   <p>He looked at me now―like a jab between the eyes with a poker. “If you insist on putting it crudely―yes,” he snarled. “Now can you understand why you mustn’t interfere? This is a delicate situation, Shaw. If the authorities get their hands on her prematurely―or the newspapers―”</p>
   <p>“How do you know I won’t go to the nearest telephone and give the whole story to the police? I could use a few points with them.”</p>
   <p>His eyes gnawed at me. “I’m walking a knife-edge, Shaw,” he said hoarsely. “I know something of you; I’ve done some checking. You’re a man who probes―and probes. This situation can’t stand probing. Very well―perhaps I made an error in confiding in you. It will, of course, be your unsupported word against mine, if you choose to betray my confidence. I see little advantage to you in so doing. In the end, the result will be the same. Ellen will obviously have to be placed under restraint. It’s merely a question of reducing the tragic impact on others―her sister, for example.”</p>
   <p>“You mentioned other incidents.”</p>
   <p>“Small things, in the main: bursts of petulance, petty cruelties. Afterwards she was always contrite―”</p>
   <p>“In the main, you said.”</p>
   <p>“Damn you―haven’t you raked enough scandal for one morning?”</p>
   <p>“The incident that wasn’t minor―how long ago would that have been, Mr. Prendergast?”</p>
   <p>“It slips my mind,” he said coldly.</p>
   <p>“About two years, say?”</p>
   <p>“Damn you,” he repeated in a whisper.</p>
   <p>This time I got up first. “Where are you looking for her?”</p>
   <p>“I’m checking the hotels, out-of-town friends. A few places up the coast where the girls have spent weekends on occasion. Credit card usage, that sort of thing. Quietly, of course.”</p>
   <p>“What makes you think you’ll find her before the cops?”</p>
   <p>“I can only do my best!”</p>
   <p>“If you find her, will you call me?”</p>
   <p>“Why should I?”</p>
   <p>“I’m a bit involved, Mr. Prendergast, like it or not. I’d like to have some idea just how far my neck is out. That way I might get a chance to get it in before the knife falls.”</p>
   <p>“Very well. I’ll keep you advised.”</p>
   <p>“How much of this does Mianne know?”</p>
   <p>“Nothing. Nothing at all. She’s taking her mother’s death badly. For God’s sake leave her out of this.” He glared at me; then his expression got thoughtful. “Look here, Shaw. Perhaps<emphasis> you</emphasis> could find her. After all, you’re in that sort of business.”</p>
   <p>“Perhaps. It would depend on how much help I got.”</p>
   <p>“Damn it, man, I’ve told you all I know! I’d pay well, of course,” he added.</p>
   <p>“How well?”</p>
   <p>“Shall we say―a thousand dollars, if you locate her before the police, and put me in touch with her?”</p>
   <p>I stood. He did too. “Well―do we have an understanding?”</p>
   <p>“I’ll think it over.”</p>
   <p>He trailed me to the door. Halfway through it I looked back.</p>
   <p>“You know a man named Jaster?”</p>
   <p>He shook his head, looking impatient, nothing more. “Please, Mr. Shaw. No more today.”</p>
   <p>I left and drove back down to the office.</p>
   <p>The elevator seemed to creak a little more than usual, as if it was already tired, with a long day ahead. Behind the door of the painless dentist down the hall a typewriter clattered with a brisk, cheery sound, as if it was typing up fat bills.</p>
   <p>I knew there was someone waiting in my outer office before I opened the door; I opened it anyway.</p>
   <p>Ellen Prendergast was sitting in the chair by the window.</p>

   </title>
   <p>She was wearing the same outfit I had seen her in the previous day. It didn’t look slept in. Her hair was brushed, smooth and neat, her lips touched up. She was sitting rather primly on the edge of the chair, looking every inch the moneyed client. Only her eyes said she hadn’t slept last night.</p>
   <p>I went over and unlocked the inner office door and picked up the mail and dropped it in the wastebasket and dumped the ash tray after it. That took care of my housekeeping. I leaned in the connecting doorway and got out a cigarette and tapped it on my thumb and stuck it in my mouth. Miss Prendergast patiently watched me do all this.</p>
   <p>“May I come in?” she said. I nodded and got out of her way. She sat in the chair by my desk. I went around behind it and parked myself in mine. That put us in business position.</p>
   <p>“Shoot,” I said.</p>
   <p>“Please―are you going to play that objectionable role again today?”</p>
   <p>Looking at her, I couldn’t decide whether she’d heard the news or not.</p>
   <p>“You forgot to light your cigarette,” she said.</p>
   <p>I lit it. “Have you seen the paper?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“Yes.” She looked at me, looked away, looked back. “My mother was killed, Mr. Shaw.”</p>
   <p>“The paper said accident.”</p>
   <p>“The paper lied.”</p>
   <p>“Or made a mistake, maybe.”</p>
   <p>“Lied. Last year one of their reporters came to the house wanting to do some sort of Sunday supplement article on us. Uncle Frank had Thompson eject him. He wrote the article anyway. He referred to Mother as an invalid dying in an upstairs room while we―Mianne and I―pursued a wild life of pleasure. They knew she couldn’t have gotten to the stairs alone, Mr. Shaw.”</p>
   <p>“Anything in it? The wild life of pleasure, I mean.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know why you seem intent on baiting me, Mr. Shaw. I came here to consult you. You<emphasis> are</emphasis> a private detective, aren’t you?”</p>
   <p>“In a small way of business.”</p>
   <p>“Is there some reason I shouldn’t employ you?”</p>
   <p>“Is there some reason you should?”</p>
   <p>“I want to know who killed my mother.”</p>
   <p>“Any ideas?”</p>
   <p>“Yes.”</p>
   <p>“Who?”</p>
   <p>She shook her head. “I don’t want to prejudice you. I may be utterly wrong. I may be imagining things. I . . . hope I am. Perhaps you can tell me.”</p>
   <p>“Where were you yesterday, Miss Prendergast―at the time of your mother’s fall?”</p>
   <p>“I’m . . . not sure. After I saw you I didn’t feel like going home. I drove out to the beach. We have a cottage up past Cape Royal, I thought of going there. Then after I’d stopped for gas I just kept on going. I didn’t want to be alone. I stopped and had lunch at a place called Trajan’s.”</p>
   <p>“That would be what time?”</p>
   <p>“Noon, or a little after. I stayed there for a couple of hours, I suppose.”</p>
   <p>“That would make it two p.m. at the latest. Mrs. Prendergast died at about three.”</p>
   <p>“I left there and drove north, almost to Ventura. I went to a drive-in movie. Afterwards I ate dinner. I drove some more. I wasn’t going anywhere, just driving around. Have you ever not wanted to go home, Mr. Shaw?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t suppose you just happened to stop to fill the tank at three p.m. And that the attendant would remember you.”</p>
   <p>Her face changed a little; her eyes held on mine.</p>
   <p>“The police are looking for you,” I said.</p>
   <p>Her expression didn’t change much. Just stiffened up. I watched her handling the idea, getting the full implications.</p>
   <p>“I . . . see. Of course.”</p>
   <p>“Why didn’t you call home?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know.”</p>
   <p>“Your uncle’s a little worried about you.”</p>
   <p>She looked at me.</p>
   <p>“He offered me a fat fee to find you and bring you home―to him, not the police.”</p>
   <p>Her face went perfectly still. If there’d been any color in it, it was gone now.</p>
   <p>“I didn’t take the job,” I said.</p>
   <p>Her mouth twitched as if it was trying to smile and couldn’t quite make it. She leaned toward me―farther. Her eyes rolled up. I got a hand out just in time to keep her from banging the desk with her chin. I came around the end of the desk and got her out of the chair and laid her out on the old green leather settee I keep around for emergencies. Her eyelids looked as transparent as pale blue tissue paper. They fluttered and opened.</p>
   <p>“Don’t yell,” I said. “You just took a short nap.” I got the office bottle out and poured her half an inch in one of my jelly glasses. She swallowed it and shuddered, but the vacant look went away from her eyes.</p>
   <p>“I feel like a fool,” she said, and sat up.</p>
   <p>“When did you see that paper, Ellen?”</p>
   <p>“About midnight. I picked it up on a newsstand at Sherman Oaks. Some sort of early edition. It was strange: I wasn’t shocked or surprised. It was as if I’d been expecting it. As if it were what I’d been waiting for.”</p>
   <p>“How well did you and your mother get on?”</p>
   <p>“Very well, of course. I can’t say as much for her relations with Mianne, of course. She was so impatient with her, especially since she’s been sick . . . “ She let the rest of that trail off.</p>
   <p>“Where did your parents meet?”</p>
   <p>“In Florida. Mr. Shaw, does this have anything to do―”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know yet, Miss Prendergast. But I’m working on it. Your father had business interests there, I understand.”</p>
   <p>“I suppose so. But―”</p>
   <p>“In Tampa,” I added.</p>
   <p>“So I understand. Mr. Shaw, I really don’t think―”</p>
   <p>“What did she do? Your mother. What kind of work?”</p>
   <p>“I . . . don’t know that she . . . I think they met socially, at a party.”</p>
   <p>“How much education did she have?”</p>
   <p>“She was not a college graduate.”</p>
   <p>“Or high school, either. What was she, Ellen? A waitress? Show business? Or something gamier?”</p>
   <p>Her face had the chalky look again. She was having a rough morning. “You can really be quite horrible, can’t you, Mr. Shaw? In answer to your question―I don’t know. I made it my business never to inquire too closely. Does that satisfy you?”</p>
   <p>“I’m not asking questions just to see you blush, Miss Prendergast,” I said. This time I poured one for myself too. We drank them off and looked at each other.</p>
   <p>“Where did you spend the night?”</p>
   <p>“At a motel. The Blue Pacific. Near Port Hueneme. A ghastly little room.”</p>
   <p>“How did you get here?”</p>
   <p>“I drove into town early, about daylight. I parked near the bus station and walked over. I . . . thought I came up here on impulse, but perhaps this was where I intended to come all along.”</p>
   <p>I started to uncap the bottle again, but instead I jammed it back in the drawer and got out of my chair―maybe to get away from temptation. She watched me do a couple of lengths of the room. I went back and sat down and got the bottle out and poured and drank. It didn’t change anything. It so seldom does.</p>
   <p>“I take it you don’t want to see your uncle,” I said.</p>
   <p>“No.”</p>
   <p>“Any particular reason?”</p>
   <p>“None that I’d care to talk about.”</p>
   <p>“What do you plan to do now?”</p>
   <p>“That’s what I thought about all night.” She gave me a wan little smile. “Somehow, I thought you might advise me.”</p>
   <p>“I could make some good friends downtown by picking up that phone,” I said, just to hear myself talk. “To say nothing of Uncle Frank’s offer.” She took that calmly, just looked at me, waiting. She was in my hands now. Whatever I thought was best. The old family detective, he’ll fix everything.</p>
   <p>“I know a place where you could stay for a few days without finding it mentioned in the gossip columns,” I said. “The Dockweiler. Nothing fancy, but no cockroaches. The problem is getting you there. The building is probably watched. They’ll have spotted your car by now.” I got out of the chair and went and peered out the window.</p>
   <p>“You’d better give me some money. A hundred dollars will do. I’ll give you a receipt that says you’re retaining me.”</p>
   <p>She dug it out of her change purse and I typed out the receipt.</p>
   <p>“I’m going down for a paper now,” I said. “If anybody knocks, or if the telephone rings, don’t answer it. Remember―you’re not here at all.”</p>
   <p>“If the police come, I’ll tell them you convinced me to turn myself in.” She gave me the brave little smile. I gave her back a grimace and went down to the street.</p>
   <p>There were no squad cars loaded with buttons double-parked at the curb. No large men sat in parked sedans reading newspapers. I didn’t see the glint of sunlight from binoculars on the surrounding roof tops. There could still have been a squad of plainclothesmen watching every move I made and I’d never have known it. I strolled along to the corner espresso joint and got an elbow in among the regulars and gave the high sign. A shopworn bunny who had outgrown her uniform pushed a cup across at me and brushed back her bangs with a forearm and gave me a tragic look and rushed away. A size forty-eight hip jostled me halfway off my perch. A newspaper flapped in my face. An elbow dug into my back. I turned.</p>
   <p>“Nothing personal, pal,” a bald man in a brown plastic jacket said.</p>
   <p>“The motto of our times,” I said. The coffee tasted like the stuff they dip brass in to take off the tarnish; that made it easy to leave after a couple of swallows. Back on the sidewalk, I did a slow ankle to the next corner. Old Shaw, taking his time, lingering over his morning coffee and having his morning stroll. No guilty conscience, nothing to hide. I came back along the block behind the Banshire Building, up the side, and back in at the front door. No cops. No visible cops, that is. Just the usual collection of faces, plus a few transients. No suspicious loiterers, except maybe me.</p>
   <p>Back upstairs, Ellen Prendergast was sitting exactly where I’d left her. She stood as I came in.</p>
   <p>“All right,” I said. “If there’s a stake-out I can’t see it. You’re going out alone. Take the side exit.” I told her where it was. “Don’t be in a hurry. You’re just out to do a little shopping. Walk east two blocks. There’s a storage garage. Walk through it. I’ll pick you up in back.”</p>
   <p>She nodded a little stiffly and went out. I listened until the elevator had clashed its doors and the hum had faded. Down the hall the typewriter was still clattering. It sounded like a big month for the dentist.</p>
   <p>“Come on, Shaw,” I said, “get your head all the way into the noose. There’s nothing worse than a sloppy hanging.”</p>
   <p>I rode the elevator down, drove around to the garage and parked in the alley. In five minutes Ellen Prendergast arrived, looking a little scared but still in control. She even managed a small smile as she slid in beside me.</p>
   <p>“Maybe the police aren’t as interested in me as you thought, Mr. Shaw.”</p>
   <p>“They fumble one once in a while, too,” I said. We didn’t talk on the way to the hotel.</p>

   <p>I watched the rearview. Nobody seemed to be following, but I took the long way anyway. Which didn’t mean I wasn’t followed.</p>
   <p>Stan Fellows, the day clerk, was on duty. He checked Miss Smith into 507 without leering. I got her settled, then came back down to the desk. Stan was sorting letters into pigeonholes. He paused to read a postcard, shook his head sadly, filed it, dropped the rest of the mail on the switchboard desk, and said, “How long will Miss Smith be with us, Joe?”</p>
   <p>“A day or two. Possibly longer. She’s not expecting any visitors, Stan.”</p>
   <p>“Unless they show a badge. Check.”</p>
   <p>I put a twenty on the counter. “She’ll be phoning out for a few necessities. Outside of that I don’t think she’ll be making any calls. She won’t be going out.”</p>
   <p>“Sure. A home girl.”</p>
   <p>“If she calls anybody―let me know. If she tries to leave―delay her and call me. Fast. Got it?”</p>
   <p>He frowned and rubbed his forefinger on his lower lip. “Hell, Joe, I can’t keep her here―as long as she pays her bill.”</p>
   <p>“Right. You get the idea. The twenty’s on top.”</p>
   <p>“Do I?” He shook his head, but he took the twenty.</p>
   <p>I sat in the car for a few minutes, thinking or―trying to―before I started up and drove back to the office.</p>

   <p>Dreyfus telephoned me just after three.</p>
   <p>“Heard anything from this client of yours―Anglich?”</p>
   <p>I gripped the phone a little tighter. “No―have you?”</p>
   <p>“No. I checked with Lacey. He gave you a clean bill―up to now.”</p>
   <p>“Any line on Ellen Prendergast?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“Nothing yet. I’m not too concerned about that. She’ll have to come out eventually.”</p>
   <p>“Getting all the cooperation you need out of Frank Prendergast?”</p>
   <p>“He’s told us what he could. It isn’t much. Naturally, the old man’s not enthusiastic about the situation.”</p>
   <p>“He offer you a deal?”</p>
   <p>“What kind of deal?”</p>
   <p>“That little extra measure of candor―in return for the soft pedal.”</p>
   <p>“He wouldn’t get anywhere with that.”</p>
   <p>“How much did you tell him yesterday―about me being the one who found the body?”</p>
   <p>“Just that. Why?”</p>
   <p>“I just wanted to know if I had anything to be cagey about next time I see him.”</p>
   <p>“You won’t be seeing him for a while. He’s out of town. He and the daughter―the one who didn’t fly the coop. They flew over to Vegas for a few days.”</p>
   <p>It seemed like a long pause before I said, “Kind of in a hurry, wasn’t he? Didn’t even wait for the funeral.”</p>
   <p>“You’re out of touch, Shaw. The funeral was at noon today. You can’t blame him for wanting to get out of the house for a while.” His voice sounded too casual.</p>
   <p>“Can’t you? I thought you boys could blame anybody for anything―if it suited you.”</p>
   <p>“Well, you chew that over, Shaw. Maybe there’s a lesson in it for you.” He hung up without waiting for the snappy comeback.</p>
   <p>Some time went by while I sat and looked at a patch of not too clean wall, combing through the conversation I’d just had for the part between the lines. Cops didn’t call me up just to pass the time of day and pass along the latest gossip. Dreyfus had had a reason. And if I was any judge of oblique motives, he’d gotten what he wanted. Either I’d told him something without meaning to, or he’d planted an idea on me that was supposed to take root and grow into something he could use.</p>
   <p>Nothing I’d said told him anything he didn’t already know. If he knew I’d seen Prendergast that morning he hadn’t let on. That left his big news―that Uncle Frank had left town.</p>
   <p>Maybe that was supposed to panic me into some indiscreet behavior. I tried to think of some indiscreet behavior to be panicked into, but nothing presented itself. I found myself getting out the old reliable flask from the desk drawer without even being aware of it. The level had fallen to a perilous low. I wondered how much of it I’d drunk without knowing it. It had been a new bottle when Anglich was here. I’d done him a lot of good. He was a lucky man to have me looking out for him. I shook the bottle and put it away. I got out a couple of pencils and sharpened them. I picked a letter out of the in basket and read it. It was from a correspondence school that wanted to teach me how to become an astrologer. Detect Character Through Stellar Influence. Read Facts in the Stars. We all know that the tides due to the sun and moon affect crops, fishing, etc. Scientists concede relation of Sun-spot Cycle to human affairs. Why not apply this ancient knowledge to Twentieth-Century Crime Detection? Chance of a Lifetime. Send only $14.98. Signed, B’ahu Alah.</p>
   <p>I threw the chance of a lifetime in the wastebasket―probably not for the first time. I wondered if Mr. B’ahu Alah had predicted that. Then I fished it back out and tucked the letter in the enclosed franked envelope and sealed it.</p>
   <p>Down in the lobby I dropped it in the mailbox. That’s more like it, Shaw. Don’t ever get so busy you neglect your little jokes. Even if you have to do it cold turkey. Think of appearances. Read the future in the stars. Maybe it was as good a place as any.</p>
   <p>I got in my jalopy and drove over to the Penguin Lounge.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>
    <p>Chapter 26</p>
   </title>
   <p>The mid-afternoon lull was on. The noontime drinkers had mostly tottered off for a nap to get in shape for the evening’s elbow marathon, and the late shift hadn’t come on yet. I parked at the end of the bar and ordered a Bacardi cocktail. It was an old tradition with me to order a Bacardi at the Penguin, dating back to yesterday.</p>
   <p>The bartender was a youngish fellow with curly brown hair whose boyish good looks were beginning to fade a little around the edges. He’d probably come out here ten years ago to make it big in the movies. At least he was working.</p>
   <p>“You look kind of down, pal,” he said. “Anything I can do to brighten the picture?”</p>
   <p>“You might try stocking a better grade of ant-killer,” I said.</p>
   <p>“If it was any better they’d start complaining about the size of the drinks,” he said.</p>
   <p>“And if the drinks were any smaller they’d complain about the prices.”</p>
   <p>“And if the prices were any lower you wouldn’t be able to drink it.”</p>
   <p>“Every profession has its problems.”</p>
   <p>He wagged his head and refilled my glass without my asking. “You take women. I get all kinds in here. Old dames with junk jewelry halfway to the elbow, and elbows like turkey wings, and don’t think they don’t bend ‘em. According to them, they all tested the same day as Myrna Loy, only she flopped for the director and aced ‘em out of a big career. I get the middle-aged ones that are taking a little longer every day to get the face nailed back on, and spend the afternoon in here telling me the inside story on how Lana Turner lost her looks. And the young ones, the ones that were the queen of the ball back in Dry Creek, Oklahoma, or Spudville, Idaho, that figured all they had to do was shake it a couple of times and knock over Levine like they did the bag-boys back at the Piggly Wiggly store. And they all let slip they live up in the next block and have trouble sleeping nights. That’s supposed to take care of the bar tab. How much action they think a guy can handle, for chrissake? Besides, I have to pay for this stuff. You can’t kill ants for free, after all.”</p>
   <p>He went down the bar to top off an elderly gent in rumpled white linen who looked like an escapee from one of those sweat and gin films that they don’t make nearly so well as they used to when Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre were around. He polished his way back up to me and said, “Hey, didn’t 1 see you around before?”</p>
   <p>“What a memory,” I said.</p>
   <p>“Yeah―it was yesterday.” He worked hard on a stubborn spot in easy conversational―not to say confidential―distance.</p>
   <p>“The lady you was with: some looker; no offense.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t kid me,” I said. “You know her. She’s regular here.”</p>
   <p>His grin was a little flustered, but not enough to build anything on.</p>
   <p>“You know her pretty good?”</p>
   <p>“I haven’t been up to see her etchings yet,” I said.</p>
   <p>He wagged his head. “What is it with a dame like that?”</p>
   <p>I took a swallow instead of answering.</p>
   <p>“The first time I seen her―couple years back―she come in with a couple nances in pink and green silk suits. With perfume on, yet. Them, not her. A dame like that―with them two. Can you tie it?” He gave me an oblique look that I wasn’t supposed to notice.</p>
   <p>“Maybe she was bored. A girl with all that money can still get bored, you know.”</p>
   <p>“Greasers,” he said. “I seen her here a couple times with greasers. A dame like that. It makes you want to take a swing at something.”</p>
   <p>“Did you?”</p>
   <p>He stiffened a little; that broke the rhythm of his polishing. He tossed the cloth down under the bar and leaned on his left elbow.</p>
   <p>“Sure,” he said, and gave me a flat look. “What guy wouldn’t?” His right hand was down under the bar, about where it would have to be hovering near whatever he kept there. He seemed to be a fellow who was expecting trouble. I nodded in a knowledgeable way and swallowed some more of the drink and got out a cigarette. He scratched a match and held it for me. We were still pals.</p>
   <p>“I’ll give you a tip, chum,” he said. “Don’t make no long-range plans with that one. She’s strictly out for the kick of the moment, if you know what I mean.”</p>
   <p>I blew out smoke and looked philosophical. Or maybe I just looked sad. It’s hard to tell the two expressions apart.</p>
   <p>“Her old man kicked off just in time,” he said.</p>
   <p>I held my expression in place and made it a point not to accidentally stick the cigarette in my eye.</p>
   <p>“Meaning what,” I said.</p>
   <p>“Hell, he’d of cut her out of the will if he’d lived another week. That was known.” He licked his lips and looked at me. He was a boy who was just aching to give out with the dirt. And I was the boy who would listen.</p>
   <p>I yawned a little and looked at my watch. I said, “Yeah?”</p>
   <p>“Damn right. Hell, the babe was out making the rounds every night, with every two-bit grifter that ever planted a cockroach in a Martini so he could squawk on the bill. She run around with guys like London, that ran the Chateau Club down at Playa del Rey. Hell, she was there the night they raided the joint and closed it down, only the old man kept it out of the papers.”</p>
   <p>“That so?” I said.</p>
   <p>“Damn right. Believe me, brother, I’d know.” The grin was that of a man who would know.</p>
   <p>“Go on,” I said. “I’ll bet you never even got to warm up in the bull pen.”</p>
   <p>He looked huffy and marched off to service a pair in the forty-going-on-sixty-five age group, all pancake makeup and mummified curls, with a sprinkling of crimson war paint. I went out and along to the corner and dropped a dime in a pale green telephone beside a plastic rocketship outside a drugstore. A pint-sized delinquent wearing an expression of wary suspicion was sitting in the saddle. We sneered at each other through the glass while I listened to the ring signal. A chipper female voice answered; I asked for Lacey.</p>
   <p>“Well, howsa boy?” he said in the lazy sort of drawl they use as they slip on the brass knuckles. “Glad you phoned in.”</p>
   <p>“Barely making expenses,” I said. “A guy named London: used to run a little flash gambling out of a place called the Chateau Club. What’s he doing now?”</p>
   <p>“London, huh? It’s an angle, at that. What<emphasis> would</emphasis> he be doing?”</p>
   <p>“All right―where’s he doing it.”</p>
   <p>Lacey chuckled softly. “The sign says<emphasis> The Blue Dahlia―</emphasis>but the address ain’t changed. Funny, huh?”</p>
   <p>“Well, the sheriff has to eat too. What was that crack about being glad I called in?”</p>
   <p>“Nothing much, Joe. Just a couple kind of funny items I thought you might get a laugh out of. You remember I told you about the city turning up a Tampa boy over on Alamitos?”</p>
   <p>I thought hard. I didn’t remember him mentioning Alamitos.</p>
   <p>“Oh, on Alamitos, was it?” I said.</p>
   <p>“Oh, didn’t I say before? I must of forgot. Anyway, I hear they fell over another one. A body, I mean. And whattya know―they check out the prints with DC and turns out it’s another guy from Tampa.” He paused to let that sink in. “And then a couple nights ago they get a tip somebody ditched a Thompson up at the top of Mulholland Drive. It ain’t filed. Guess what? It was stole from Strike Command Headquarters at MacDill, about a year ago.”</p>
   <p>“So?”</p>
   <p>“You’re not sharp this afternoon, Joe. MacDill is at Tampa. In my book that’s a lot of Tampa.”</p>
   <p>“So it seems.”</p>
   <p>“Heard from Anglich?” he said sharply.</p>
   <p>“Maybe he went back to Tampa. The population must have been depleted.”</p>
   <p>“Uh-huh. Could be. Well, keep in touch.”</p>
   <p>I told him I would. As I came out of the booth the little monster on the rocket got down briskly and aimed a businesslike kick at my ankle. He did it as if he’d kicked a lot of ankles in his time and had enjoyed the sensation. I shifted my foot just enough to let his shin connect with the edge of my shoe. He opened his mouth to let out a blat and a pregnant woman with limp black hair grabbed his arm and gave me a look like a curare dart. He kicked her in the leg and she slapped him hard enough to rattle the marbles in his pants pocket.</p>
   <p>I had the feeling they deserved each other.</p>
   <p>I got in my heap and headed out of there. The neighborhood was too rough for me.</p>

    <p>Chapter 27</p>
   </title>
   <p>Santa Monica Boulevard was full of the usual fast field of pecking-order rejects, gunning hard on the straightaways and chewing their steering wheels at the lights, hurrying home to take out the day’s accumulation of bad temper on their wives. They thinned out after the freeway and I made time on the empty stretch past the airport and the cemetery. The sun was dead ahead, the color of a brush fire but without heat. I turned left on Lincoln, crossed Ballona Creek, and zigzagged over to the beach.</p>
   <p>The surf wasn’t running; in any case it was too late in the day for the beautiful people who spend their time between welfare checks waiting around the beach to be discovered by the movie scouts. The rumpled brown sand was as empty as an unmade bed; it looked tired and dirty, like an arena after the bullfights are over. The ocean was the color of old dishwater, sloshed up on shore by a careless scrubwoman. An airplane banked in tiredly against the purple evening clouds, lining up for final approach to L.A. International, like a weary sea bird at the end of a long crossing.</p>
   <p>The houses and motels thinned out. I passed a public beach and a stretch of vacant land with real estate agents’ signs planted every hundred feet. On a rising bluff ahead a sign peeped into view among trees; scrawled neon letters spelled out<emphasis> The Blue Dahlia</emphasis> through a light mist.</p>
   <p>I swung in between massive white pillars with peeling stucco and drove back under the big Monterey cypresses and parked next to a high, white-painted frame building that had probably been a nice place to spend a weekend as a house guest sixty years ago.</p>
   <p>There were lights on on the high porch that ran all the way around three sides. Tables were set up on the porch with metal-legged chairs leaning in against them.</p>
   <p>A single carriage lantern beside the walk gleamed on a strip of dull red carpet that ran up the center of the wide steps. Dull gay deck paint shone wetly with the mist as I crossed the porch.</p>
   <p>The door was standing open, propped with a gilded brick. Inside were dim lights, more stacked chairs, a curve of bar, an illuminated clock with a beer ad. A big man detached himself from the shadows and drifted into my path.</p>
   <p>“Not open yet, bud,” he said indifferently. “Come back around eight.”</p>
   <p>I stopped. It was that or walk over him.</p>
   <p>“London around?”</p>
   <p>He looked me over. With the light behind him all I could see was a wide face on a short neck above shoulders like the foothills of the Rockies.</p>
   <p>“Who should I say is asking?”</p>
   <p>“The name wouldn’t mean anything to him.”</p>
   <p>Another long pause. He was a man who thought before speaking. He said, “Wait here,” and moved off into darkness. A door at the back opened and closed. Some time passed. Cars went by on the road. The clock back of the bar said seven-thirty. Then it said seven-forty. I walked back to the door the big man had gone through and pushed it open on a passage with yellow wallpaper going up to a high cornice. Wall brackets that had once been gas fixtures held candle-shaped bulbs that gave a weak yellow light. More light leaked under a closed door down the hall. Faint gurgling sounds came from behind it. I opened the door and walked in.</p>
   <p>Rex London sat behind an old oak desk that had been painted over with a reddish varnish that was somebody’s idea of the mahogany look. It had been quite a few years since last we’d met. He was a little leaner, a little hollower under the cheekbones than when I’d seen him last. Some of the sleek, sharp-tailored gloss was gone, along with some of the hair. He was in the act of pouring himself a shot from a large bottle of Cutty Sark. He jerked when he saw me and spilled a little.</p>
   <p>“You ever heard of knocking?” he barked, and put the bottle away quickly, as if he was afraid I’d ask for a drink.</p>
   <p>I swung a leather-backed chair away from the wall so that it half faced the door and sat in it. He fingered the shot glass, staring at me; he lifted it suddenly and tilted it down his throat, took a tissue from a box and wiped his mouth. I looked around the room, at chintzy wallpaper with water spots, at the cheap, stiff curtains on the big double-hung window, at the brown filing cabinet and the rug that showed unfaded patches where other furniture had stood once.</p>
   <p>“Not like the old days, Rex,” I said. “No chromium doorframes, no milk glass in the foyer, no little Spanish orchestra behind a carved screen, no fine crimson steps down to the oval dance floor. Not even the carnation in the lapel. You’ve slipped, pal.”</p>
   <p>“You’ve aged,” he said sourly. “What do you want, Shaw?”</p>
   <p>“Seen Miss Prendergast lately?” I said politely.</p>
   <p>London’s face clamped shut like a slammed book. His eyes got sharp and angry. He reached under the desk and thumbed something, sat back glaring at me.</p>
   <p>“I thought so,” I said. “When was she here last?”</p>
   <p>A side door opened and a tall, rangy man in a white shirt and high-waisted pleated slacks came through it. He halted with his eyes on me.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, boss?” he said in a rather high, husky voice.</p>
   <p>“Throw this grifter out, Elmer.”</p>
   <p>The rangy man’s mouth twitched; he jerked a thumb over his shoulder. “Up and out, Jack. Let’s go.”</p>
   <p>I didn’t move. He made a sound in his throat and stepped in and threw a swift right hook at my head. I was balanced for it; I leaned right and took the wrist he’d offered me and came up out of the chair and dropped my left arm over his biceps. I locked the wrist behind his elbow and ran him forward, continuing the momentum of his swing. His head hit the wall hard enough to dislodge a framed liquor license, which shattered on the floor. Elmer fell on top of it. As I turned London’s hand was just coming out of the drawer. He showed me a .32 Walther with almost an apologetic air. I walked around the end of the desk and took it out of his hand and threw it in the wastebasket.</p>
   <p>“Let’s not waste time, Rex,” I said. “You didn’t want to shoot anybody. I just came out for a little talk-talk.”</p>
   <p>“I’ve got nothing to say to you, Shaw.”</p>
   <p>“Sure you have. You’d lots rather chin with me than have your loan called down at the sheriff’s office. We were talking about Miss Prendergast.”</p>
   <p>“What’s the sheriff got to do with anything? My hands are clean, you’ve got nothing on me. I welcome investigation by the Sheriff’s Office or anybody else.”</p>
   <p>“The sheriff will do. OK if I use your phone?” I reached for it. His hand got there first.</p>
   <p>“Wait a minute, Shaw. What’s this about? Why are you making waves?”</p>
   <p>I went back and sat down in my chair. Elmer snored peacefully on the rug. London’s eyes stuck to me like <emphasis>banderillas,</emphasis> watching me light a cigarette and drop the match on the floor.</p>
   <p>“Miss Prendergast,” I reminded him gently.</p>
   <p>He grimaced and made a chopping gesture. “That dame’s nuts,” he said suddenly. “Completely out of her mind.”</p>
   <p>“That so?”</p>
   <p>“Listen―the last time I saw that fool female she came in here waving a gun. At me! She could have blown my head off!”</p>
   <p>“Why didn’t she?”</p>
   <p>He picked up his shot glass and squeezed another drop from it. “I managed to convince her she was off base. God knows how. She ought to be locked up.”</p>
   <p>“What was it about?”</p>
   <p>“She had some screwy idea I was mixed up in some kind of shady deal with her uncle. A lot of damned nonsense. I tell you she was raving.”</p>
   <p>“Where did she get that idea?”</p>
   <p>He waved a hand. “How would I know? Where do screwballs get their screwball ideas?”</p>
   <p>“You know the uncle?”</p>
   <p>“I’ve seen him a few times.”</p>
   <p>“Here?”</p>
   <p>“Maybe. What’s all this to you, Shaw? Did that damned girl hire you to come out here?”</p>
   <p>I shook my head. “Tell me a little more about this deal you weren’t in on,” I said.</p>
   <p>He chewed his teeth and wrinkled his face at me. “All I know is what she was saying. Why don’t you ask her?”</p>
   <p>“I’m asking you.”</p>
   <p>“Well . . . she had some nutty idea I was in touch with some hoodlums, hired muscles.” His voice had dropped to a mutter. “I was supposed to be lining them up for Frank. For Mr. Prendergast, I mean―”</p>
   <p>“First name terms, eh? Go ahead.”</p>
   <p>“According to her, her uncle was pulling some kind of monkeyshines. She talked about . . . killings.” He looked at the end of his shoe, at the filing cabinet, at Elmer’s open mouth, anywhere but at me.</p>
   <p>“Past or future?”</p>
   <p>“Future. Past. Both. I don’t know. Look here, Shaw―all this has got nothing to do with me, understand? I want no part of it!”</p>
   <p>“How long ago was this routine with the gun?”</p>
   <p>“A week ago tomorrow.” He turned to look at the wall calendar as he spoke; that kept him from seeing my jaw drop. I drew a breath and let it out and said, “Seen the papers?”</p>
   <p>He got a good grip on his knuckles and cracked them with a sound like dry twigs snapping in a fire.</p>
   <p>“Yeah.” His voice was a near whisper. “Accidental death. You can’t make anything of that.”</p>
   <p>“Mrs. Prendergast hadn’t walked in years, Rex. She was found at the foot of a staircase. She had help getting there.”</p>
   <p>His face had taken on a look like unbaked pastry. He shook his head. “Naw,” he said. “Naw, you’re on a bum lay, Shaw, you’re sniffing at the wrong tree, I don’t care what that dame said―”</p>
   <p>“How long since you were in Tampa, Rex?”</p>
   <p>“What? I was never in Tampa. Florida, you mean? Never.” He looked at me anxiously as if he was eager to field the next question.</p>
   <p>“You know a couple of workers named Sid and Rosie?”</p>
   <p>He shook his head emphatically.</p>
   <p>“Done any business with Jaster lately?”</p>
   <p>“Who?”</p>
   <p>I reached across to snuff out my cigarette. “I take it you hadn’t seen her in a while.”</p>
   <p>“Who? The Prendergast girl? Hell, I never saw her before in my life.”</p>
   <p>“That so?” I hoped it sounded casual. “You used to be seen around a little with one of the Prendergast girls.”</p>
   <p>“That was Mianne. I took her out a few times. It never came to anything. Let’s face it: she’s out of my class.”</p>
   <p>“Such modesty. I hear she was a little wild.”</p>
   <p>“Who, Mi Prendergast? Nonsense. She wasn’t a bad kid at all.”</p>
   <p>“I heard her old man disapproved of her carryings-on.”</p>
   <p>“I wouldn’t know. I never saw the old buzzard.”</p>
   <p>“And now Miss Ellen comes in waving guns at you. That makes you acquainted with the entire Prendergast family―the survivors, that is.”</p>
   <p>“Go on―build something on it,” he said tiredly. “Get the sheriff’s boys down here to bounce me around and pry the backs off the cigarette machines and clean out the bar stock and grind cigar butts into the carpet I just paid seven bills to have put in wall to wall. I can’t tell them any more than I’ve told you, Shaw. That’s all there is.”</p>
   <p>I played with his nervous system a few more minutes and then left, with Elmer still earning his pay on the rug. I felt a little mean for some reason. The big boy was leaning against the carriage light at the foot of the front steps. He moved partly into my path as I came down.</p>
   <p>“Find Rex OK?” he said.</p>
   <p>“We decided to make a night of it,” I said. “I’m just going out for chow mein.”</p>
   <p>“A comic, huh? You want to get me fired?”</p>
   <p>“Don’t worry, Tiny,” I said. “They’ll be shooting<emphasis> The Bride of King Kong</emphasis> one of these days. All you have to do is let your pelt grow.” I put a hand on his chest and eased him aside. He let me get away with it. I don’t know why.</p>

    <p>Chapter 28</p>
   </title>
   <p>I found a parking space fifty feet from the entrance to the Dockweiler. As soon as I stepped through into the lobby I knew something was wrong.</p>
   <p>The elevator was grounded with the door open. The operator, a slim kid with pinched eyes, in pale green and tarnished gold, caressed an acned jaw with a white-gloved forefinger, watching a heavy man in a brown suit who leaned on the desk talking to a man I had never seen before. A couple of permanent residents―old men in vaguely shabby suits and high-top shoes―muttered together under the dusty rubber plants. As I crossed the lobby, the man talking to the clerk turned to stare after me.</p>
   <p>“Where’s Stan?” I asked the kid. “I thought he went off at eight.”</p>
   <p>He gave me a scornful look and didn’t move from his pose.</p>
   <p>“In Holy Cross Hospital―not expected to live.”</p>
   <p>I felt a cold sensation in the stomach that was not a result of the draft from the elevator shaft.</p>
   <p>“Shot?” I said.</p>
   <p>He gave me a slow ankles-to-neck check-out. “You said what?”</p>
   <p>“He was OK this morning. I didn’t figure it was a wasting disease.”</p>
   <p>He sneered at me and turned to look across at the brown man, who had levered himself off the desk and was coming across toward me, giving me one of those penetrating glances that’s supposed to take in everything but the monogram on your undershorts. He stopped in front of me and looked at where the carnation in my lapel would be if I had a carnation in my lapel.</p>
   <p>“Visiting somebody?” he said in a voice like Buster Keaton’s expression.</p>
   <p>“Maybe. Why?”</p>
   <p>He flipped back his coat with an indifferent gesture, giving me a quick flash of a badge pinned to the inside pocket.</p>
   <p>“Want to show me some identification?” he said in the same monotone.</p>
   <p>“Why? I don’t want to cash a check.”</p>
   <p>He sighed, made a move as if to clamp his fingers on my arm. I blocked that with my hip and said, “I’d like a longer look at the buzzer; I missed that sixth digit.”</p>
   <p>He blew some bad breath on my face and said, “Parkington, out of the sheriff’s office. Don’t get funny, guy. Who are you?”</p>
   <p>I got out my wallet and showed him my license.</p>
   <p>“Shaw, huh? I heard about you. Nothing good.” He jerked his eyes upward. “Who you going to see?”</p>
   <p>“Why does the sheriff want to know?” He pushed a little against me and I pushed back. His face turned pink around a pair of ears the color and texture of pickled pig’s feet.</p>
   <p>“On account of there was a guy come down pretty sick here this afternoon, smart guy, that’s why.”</p>
   <p>“He was asking for him, chief,” the elevator boy said quickly.</p>
   <p>“Aha.” Parkington’s hand shifted toward his belt. He must have forgotten he wasn’t pounding a beat anymore, with a pair of bracelets handy. He shifted the motion to a pat on the bulge of paunch under his coat and hitched up his pants. He smelled of denture cleaner and un-cleaned dentures.</p>
   <p>“Let’s you and me go in the office and talk,” he said, and started to turn away.</p>
   <p>“This an arrest?” I said to his back. He whirled. His eyes had a red-edged look, like a boar at bay.</p>
   <p>“By God, you’re asking for it, fella!”</p>
   <p>“And you’re just the boy that can give it to me, hey, Partington? The padded sap, the night stick in the kidneys, the kick back of the knee, the bright lights and the no sleep and the unheated cell with no furniture and yesterday’s puke on the floor. Only you forgot one thing. The sheriff is a pal of mine. Tie that one, chum.” I gave him my second-best smile, the one with the edge like a rusty razor.</p>
   <p>Various parts of his face twitched in various directions, trying out expressions. He settled for a look like a crocodile with an undigested missionary inside him.</p>
   <p>“Aw, g’wan, beat it before I get mad.”</p>
   <p>“Gosh, I bet that would be a sight to see,” I said. I stepped in the car and jerked a thumb at the ceiling, said “five.” The boy clashed doors, not looking at me. He leveled off roughly, flung the doors open.</p>
   <p>“Wait,” I said. I went along to 507 and rapped lightly. No answer. I rapped harder, then tried the knob. Locked. There was a soft rustle behind me. I came around fast and the elevator boy was there, bouncing a pass key on the soiled palm of his glove. He gave me a sly grin.</p>
   <p>“Key rental’s a sawbuck,” he said, and tossed the key up. I snatched it out of the air and jammed it in the lock and went in. The bed was made, the dresser bare, the closet empty.</p>
   <p>“Looking for anything special?” the boy said behind me.</p>
   <p>“How long’s she been gone?”</p>
   <p>He let his mouth sag open and looked up into the corner of the room. He made a Stepin Fetchit routine of scratching his narrow head.</p>
   <p>“Well, lessee. I come on at five, and I don’t rightly recollect seeing anybody check out of 507. Not as far as I can remember.” He looked at me and grinned a droop-lidded grin. “For five maybe I could remember better.”</p>
   <p>I moved toward him casually and shot out a hand and got a wad of green wool and lifted and rammed him back against the wall. “Thanks for fingering me,” I said. “Now tell it. Leave off the trimmings. Just the bare facts. What time and who with.”</p>
   <p>He spat and tried to kick me. I leaned on him and rattled his head against the wallpaper. “Talk it up, Slim.”</p>
   <p>“G-g-go to hell,” he croaked.</p>
   <p>I leaned harder. “Better spill, junior. I have that fine, careless feeling tonight. I want to hear the sound of voices. So many of the boys aren’t with us any more.”</p>
   <p>He flopped and beat his hands against the wall. His eyes goggled at me. He made gurgling noises. I slacked off.</p>
   <p>“Half past six,” he squeaked. “My God, I can’t breathe.”</p>
   <p>“Breathe later,” I said. “Keep talking.”</p>
   <p>“A guy checks her out. A old bird, snappy dresser.”</p>
   <p>“Who else?”</p>
   <p>“Nobody. Just him.”</p>
   <p>“When did Stan get sick?”</p>
   <p>“After lunch.”</p>
   <p>I pushed him away; he scuttled a few feet and jerked his uniform into line, smoothed his hair.</p>
   <p>“The lady a friend of yours?” he said, and squinted one eye at me, cocky again.</p>
   <p>“How much did he pay you?”</p>
   <p>“Who, me? Go soak your mush, chump.” He dodged back as I went past him toward the door. I took a dollar out of my wallet and tossed it his way; he snatched it and lifted his lip at me.</p>
   <p>He trailed me to the elevator, rode me down in silence. At the bottom he leaned against the door and gave me a heavy-lidded look.</p>
   <p>“Wife?” he said.</p>
   <p>“Why?”</p>
   <p>“You got problems, mister.” His voice gloated. “The guy’s got something on her. When he talks, she jumps.”</p>
   <p>“All that for the same buck?” I said, and pushed the button that whooshed the doors open.</p>
   <p>“Hey,” he said after me. “You forgot to pay for the key.”</p>
   <p>“Sue my estate,” I said, and breezed on out. Partington glared at me from his hiding place back of a plastic palm tree, but no whistles blew.</p>
   <p>I saw two gray Volkswagens on Sunset, but I was too tired to care.</p>

    <p>Chapter 29</p>
   </title>
   <p>It was after nine when I got home. I telephoned Holy Cross Hospital and asked after Stan Fellows. After two or three ricochets off the switchboard I was connected with a thin, impatient voice that identified itself as Dr. Aylesworth.</p>
   <p>“Fellows, yes. A very sick man, but he’s off the critical list.”</p>
   <p>“No possibility of talking to him tonight?”</p>
   <p>“None whatever. Who is this?”</p>
   <p>“A friend, Doc, just a friend. Not a bill collector. He was taken sick pretty suddenly, I understand.”</p>
   <p>“It’s a variant strain. Very swift in its effects. Not quite so toxic, however, as the eighteen-hour variety of botulism.”</p>
   <p>“You said botulism?”</p>
   <p>“Certainly. It still occurs, usually as a result of misguided efforts at home canning.”</p>
   <p>“What was it he ate, Doctor?”</p>
   <p>“Tuna salad. Dangerous stuff at the best of times. I suggest you call back in the morning and speak to the ward nurse.”</p>
   <p>I said I would and hung up. “Botulism, huh?” I said to the shadows in the corners of the room. “But tuna this time.”</p>
   <p>I dialed the Prendergast residence. Nobody home. At least nobody answering the telephone. I sat for a few minutes communing with myself, but it was pretty dull company. Maybe a drink would help. I had one, and another one to keep it from being lonely. There were some odds and ends in the refrigerator. I ate them and had a third drink. Life began to loosen up a little. I hummed a little ditty as I showered and shaved and came back out and made another drink. Good idea. Why didn’t it occur to me sooner.</p>
   <p>The phone rang. I grabbed it as if I was expecting good news.</p>
   <p>“Glad to have caught you at home, Mr. Shaw.” It was Frank Prendergast, sounding glad to have caught me at home.</p>
   <p>“How are things?” I said.</p>
   <p>“Fine, fine. I was just calling to tell you that Ellen’s home. I hope you didn’t go to any great trouble on account of my rather overdramatic comments this morning. However, I’m sending along my check for one thousand dollars in any event.”</p>
   <p>“That’s big of you, Mr. Prendergast. You say she’s home?”</p>
   <p>“With me, I should say, in Las Vegas. I thought it best to take her away for a while, under the circumstances.”</p>
   <p>“Where are you staying?”</p>
   <p>“I hardly think that information is pertinent, Mr. Shaw. As I was saying, Ellen had taken a room in a rather unsavory hotel. She thought better of it, and telephoned me. I picked her up quietly.”</p>
   <p>“Uh huh. May I speak to her?”</p>
   <p>“Certainly not. I don’t want her further disturbed.”</p>
   <p>“I see. Plan to tell the cops?”</p>
   <p>“They’ve already been informed,” he said, with an inch of ice on top. “They were quite satisfied for Ellen to remain in my care.”</p>
   <p>“That’s kind of unusual, Mr. Prendergast. A murder―”</p>
   <p>“Inasmuch as the police have the matter in hand I hardly think you need concern yourself further, Mr. Shaw.”</p>
   <p>“I’d like to see you, Mr. Prendergast. There are a couple of points we ought to go over―”</p>
   <p>“Out of the question. I intend to be out of town for some weeks. Possibly we’ll take a cruise.”</p>
   <p>“Mianne with you?”</p>
   <p>“Yes―not that it concerns you. You may consider the matter closed, Mr. Shaw.”</p>
   <p>I said, “Yes, but,” and the phone clicked and the dial tone was wavering in my ear. I hung up and sat looking at the phone. That, it seemed, was that. Miss Ellen was a girl who could invade<emphasis> The Blue Dahlia</emphasis> and threaten to blow a hole in a man on Monday, and on Tuesday be a shy little maid cutting roses in the garden. In the morning she could be scared to death of her big, bad uncle, but by teatime she was calling him to bail her out. A changeable girl, Miss Ellen.</p>
   <p>I washed a few dishes, rearranged the four cans of beer and the three eggs and the bacon in the refrigerator, set out a chess problem on the coffee table, and then went and stood at the window and watched the street lights shining up through the pepper trees along the curb. The phone rang. I picked it up and somebody cleared a throat at me.</p>
   <p>“On the Prendergast kill,” Pincus’ clotted voice said. “Anything new?”</p>
   <p>“Which one?”</p>
   <p>“Hah?” There was a moment of near silence in which I could hear the Pincus brains straining at the harness.</p>
   <p>“Oh, I get it. Another nifty. Save it, Shaw. You can close your books on this one. Me and Dreyfus got it doped.”</p>
   <p>“That’s nice. Who did it?”</p>
   <p>“Huh? Look, wisey, how do we know who done it? But we got the motive. Prendergast’s wall safe was open.”</p>
   <p>“Go on.”</p>
   <p>“What more do you want? Some boxman with more guts than brains watched the house until it’s clear, then goes in to work.”</p>
   <p>“What about the burglar alarms?”</p>
   <p>“What burglar alarms? The front gate’s wired, that’s all. And he don’t use that. So OK, he’s inside working and old Mrs. P. lets out a squawk, so he’s a little nervous on account of it being daylight and he croaks her. Maybe it’s an accident. Then he tosses her downstairs to make it look like she done it without help. He’s a stranger, so he don’t know she’s a cripple. You show up about then, and he outfoxes you down the back stairs, saps you down, and drives off in his car, which he parked next door on account of there’s nobody home.”</p>
   <p>“Why was the gate open over there?”</p>
   <p>“ ‘Cause some guys was working on the furnace and they left it that way. Some guys are like that. Careless.”</p>
   <p>“How does Mr. Prendergast like the theory?”</p>
   <p>“Him? He’s nuts about it. By the way, the daughter turned up, so you can scratch that angle.”</p>
   <p>“Back home, huh?”</p>
   <p>“Take a tip. Shaw―lay off the Prendergasts. They ain’t home anyway. The whole family flew over to Vegas. I guess Mr. Prendergast feels like we done all we could. So be a sweet guy and leave it lay.”</p>
   <p>“I see. Well, thanks for clearing that up. Now I can get back to my cocoa and macaroons.”</p>
   <p>He said, “Hah!” and hung up. I sat holding the phone for a few empty seconds.</p>
   <p>“Well, that’s it, Shaw,” I said aloud. “Everything’s worked out to everyone’s satisfaction―except maybe Mrs. P. and Lou Anglich and a certain out-of-work gumshoe.” I wandered back into the kitchen, still talking to myself. This morning Miss Ellen had seemed like a girl with a problem, and for a while there it had looked like something might be getting ready to give; but a few lonely hours in a grubby hotel room had corrected her thinking. There’d been a small tragedy in the family, but everyone was doing nicely now, thank you, Mr. Shaw. A few weeks on the high seas would soothe away the wrinkles in everyone’s dispositions with no need of any hired snoopers probing around and making things unpleasant. So get back to your dreary routine, Mr. Shaw. And don’t forget to open the mail before throwing it away, because Uncle Frank’s grand will be in there somewhere, a well-earned reward for keeping your nose clean.</p>
   <p>Of course that left a few loose ends like a missing client named Anglich; but I had his locker key in my safe. If he didn’t turn up in a reasonable time I could always devote the suitcase full of cash to a worthy charity―such as the Joe Shaw Retirement Fund.</p>
   <p>The doorbell dinged. Nice timing, whoever you are. Mr. Shaw is at liberty. He’s no longer working on the Prendergast case, because there isn’t any Prendergast case. And he’s not working on the Anglich case because there isn’t any Anglich.</p>
   <p>I went over and yanked the door open, ready to buy a denture brush or enter a five-year subscription to<emphasis> The American Girl</emphasis> if that was what it took to reestablish contact with the human race.</p>
   <p>There was nobody there. I stuck my head out in the hall. Nobody there either. Maybe the door to the fire stairs was still swinging and maybe not. I wasn’t in the mood for chasing anybody.</p>
   <p>A fat envelope lay on the scuffed carpet at my feet. I picked it up and went back inside and held it up to the light and then tore the flap open and took out two pieces of paper.</p>
   <p>They were birth certificates, a bit yellowed at the edges, both dated May 27, 1942. One attested to the advent of Maria Guadalupe Prendergast, in Tampa, Florida. The other recorded the birth of her twin sister, Elena Guadalupe. Both included sole prints of the right foot. Twin girls, named Prendergast. Mianne and Ellen didn’t look alike, but then there are such things as non-identical twins. So that settled that.</p>
   <p>I probed in the envelope and fished out a piece of paper. It was a sheet of cheap linen-finish stationery, the kind you buy in pads from the five and ten. On it an unlettered hand had scrawled, with several erasures:</p>
   <p>AJ left enclosed with me for safekeeping. Since I bow out of the case I bow all the way out. Believe me, I hold out nothing. All the way out is where I want to be. PS I was ribbing you about the fifty. AJ leave nothing for you, only some dirty shirts at my place. Some way to say so long to a pal.</p>
   <p>I read the note over twice but it still seemed to say the same things. So much for the adoption theory. I looked at the birth certificates some more. The father was Harvey Prendergast, the mother Consuelo Guiterrez Prendergast. I folded the papers twice and took them in the bedroom and locked them in the allegedly fireproof lock box I keep on the closet shelf and went back to the telephone.</p>

   </title>
   <p>Morry Blumenthal was still on his desk at the<emphasis> Independent.</emphasis> He yawned in my ear and said, “Yeah, what about Harvey Prendergast?”</p>
   <p>“His wife’s full name.”</p>
   <p>“Check the obit, Joe. Never mind. I’ll do it myself.” I listened to scuffling sounds, like a mouse in a wastebasket.</p>
   <p>“Yeah. Marion Prendergast, nee Hartley.”</p>
   <p>“Anything on a previous marriage? Him, I mean.”</p>
   <p>“That old kipper? I’m surprised he ever had enough vital juices flowing to manage one proposal―and I’ll bet that one was a masterpiece of poetry.”</p>
   <p>“See if the name Consuelo pops up.”</p>
   <p>“Aha. South of the border. Oke, I’ll see what I can dig. But don’t let your burial insurance lapse while you wait.”</p>
   <p>“I’ll be right here.”</p>
   <p>While I waited, I looked at the photostats some more. The names and dates were as I remembered them. Mother’s age, twenty-seven. Father’s age, twenty-five. Well, some men need a mother. As Miss Mianne had said, it was hard to picture Daddy ever being that young. I held the paper under the lamp and the figure still read twenty-five.</p>
   <p>It took me that long to get it. Shaw, one double-take.</p>
   <p>In 1942 Harvey Prendergast had been fifty if he’d been a day. A man with a certain kind of vanity might shade his age a little, but not by a factor of two.</p>
   <p>So Harvey Prendergast wasn’t the father. Not my Harvey Prendergast. I reached for the phone and it rang.</p>
   <p>“Surprise, I turned up something,” Blumenthal said, sounding a little pleased with himself, as if the old backhand was still in shape after all. “Passport application, dated 1938. Mr. and Mrs. Harvey Prendergast. He didn’t marry Marion until ‘forty-three.”</p>
   <p>“Children?”</p>
   <p>“How’d you guess?”</p>
   <p>“Two girls,” I said. “Twins.”</p>
   <p>“You should have quit while you were still playing the house’s money. One offspring, male.”</p>
   <p>“You still there?” he said after a long pause. I got my jaw shut and said, “Uh-huh. No chance of an error, Morry? I’d like two daughters a lot better.”</p>
   <p>“Hell, why call me if you got no confidence? One son. No daughter. Definitely not two daughters. Not in 1938, anyway. Funny at that, I never knew he had a son.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe he died young.”</p>
   <p>“Not too young. He was nineteen in 1938.”</p>
   <p>“OK―try this for size: the kid’s name was Harvey, just like his pa.”</p>
   <p>“Aw, you peeked.”</p>
   <p>“See if you can dig up anything else on the boy or the first wife. By the way, her name would be anything but Consuelo.”</p>
   <p>“It was Alma June. You couldn’t get much farther from Consuelo than that.”</p>
   <p>I hung up and had a quick drink to ward off head colds. It was also good for snake bites. I had one more, in case of snakes. I capped the bottle and got up and did two brisk laps of the room and sat down and went back into conference.</p>
   <p>So Harvey had a son, and the son married a Latin-type lovely older than himself, who produced twin girls. The girls wound up in an orphanage, reason unknown, and parents drop from picture. Enter Frank Prendergast. There were reasons now why he’d be on the scene. Not clear reasons, but at least a framework for reasons to be hung on. He was the uncle. He’d have a natural interest in his nieces. Maybe old Harvey had sent him East to bring his grandchildren home. Maybe . . .</p>
   <p>I got a firm grip on the thought, not squeezing too hard.</p>
   <p>Maybe one of the girls had already been handed over to foster parents. Foster parents named Conroy. Which would explain why somebody calling himself an uncle would pay ten quiet grand for the child. Naturally, Grandfather Harvey would prefer a matched set of grand-children.</p>
   <p>But Pate had told Anglich it was little Anya the Conroys had taken; and he’d given him Harvey’s picture.</p>
   <p>Anglich had mentioned that he’d had to squeeze Pate a little. Could be with a man like Anglich squeezing, a man like Pate might blurt out anything, might mention the first name that came to mind, might even hand over an old photo that might be lying around for possible future use, anything to get those big thumbs out of his neck.</p>
   <p>And then afterward, thinking it over, a man like Jaster might get to thinking, might start weighing consequences, might start getting ideas. He might even change his name and up-stakes and move West―just in case Anglich came around wanting his money back. He might check out the Prendergast angle, smell money, make a few moves, and see money coming in.</p>
   <p>But ail that would be threatened when a familiar face from the past popped up again.</p>
   <p>It would have given Jaster lots to think about when he saw Anglich, lots of new angles to figure. He had trailed him to my office and then called me, checking to see what he could milk from the situation.</p>
   <p>And then someone had come along and called all his bets. All but the ace in the hole.</p>
   <p>Pate/Jaster had had enough cunning to stash the photostats with a friend. And I had pushed the right button, and the friend had passed them on to me, not wanting to come down suddenly with the same malady that had swept Jaster away with such unseemly haste.</p>
   <p>It sounded good―or at least possible. But there was still something I wasn’t seeing.</p>
   <p>The girls were Harvey’s granddaughters, whom he had adopted, and passed off as his own. What was there in that that would bring Uncle Frank out in a case of hives? That would get Jaster and Mrs. Prendergast killed―and maybe Harvey too, if there was anything in the planted botulism angle?</p>
   <p>Nothing―except that we seemed to be one child short.</p>
   <p>There had been two Prendergast infants, plus Lou Anglich’s Anya. Now there were just the two Prendergast girls.</p>
   <p>But what if it wasn’t Anya that was missing? Maybe she was here, and had been here all along―under the name of Prendergast.</p>
   <p>Maybe Frank hadn’t been able to turn up a matched set after all. So he had done the next best thing and found a substitute. Pate had tipped him to a child of the right age, with no records behind her, no embarrassing birth certificate―and he had rung her in on brother Harvey. For which no doubt Harvey had paid handsomely. Enough to give the Conroys ten Gs and still have enough to make ends meet.</p>
   <p>Until the years passed and times got tough and it seemed appropriate to tap Harvey again.</p>
   <p>Only Harvey died.</p>
   <p>The last thing Frank would have wanted was to cut off his income. So the dirt that Ellen had on him was something else entirely.</p>
   <p>Shaw, one dead end.</p>
   <p>The phone rang.</p>
   <p>“Oke, here it is,” Morry said. “Christ, I don’t know why I do these things. It must be I’ve got a lovely character. Harvey, Jr., was a hell-raiser. He and the old man fell out. He cut him out of his will, just like you read in those old novels. Junior had a couple of minor scrapes and went East. Something was said about the Merchant Marine. That’s the last that was heard from him. Alma died in ‘forty-two, same year Junior split. Prendergast was away for a year, came back here in ‘forty-three with a new wife and started over. Acquired daughters the next year, or so it seems. That part’s pretty vague. No birth certificates on record around here.”</p>
   <p>“You forgot the mole on his left hip. Disinherited, huh? Officially?”</p>
   <p>“Hell, he put it in the paper. No longer responsible for debts, the whole<emphasis> schmear</emphasis>―and I do mean<emphasis> schmear. </emphasis>If the kid had had any reputation what the old man left of it wouldn’t stuff a pipe.”</p>
   <p>“Thanks, Morry. Let me know when you want a body found. I’ll give you my professional rate.”</p>
   <p>“OK if I specify the body? Oh―by the way . . . “</p>
   <p>I waited.</p>
   <p>“I found a little item on the brother, Frank. Interested?”</p>
   <p>“Go ahead.”</p>
   <p>“A little trouble out here, in ‘thirty-nine. Arrest for assault with a deadly weapon. Got off on a<emphasis> nolle prosequi.”</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Go ahead. Spill the rest of it.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, yeah. The victim was his brother, Harvey.”</p>
   <p>“Nice fellows, the Prendergast boys.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah. Will it be OK if I knock off now, boss? My wife thinks I should come home in time to go to the office in the morning.”</p>
   <p>I held the button down and then dialed the hospital. Stan Fellows was still incommunicado. I had a drink and tried to think of somebody else to call, but no names leaped to mind.</p>

    <p>Chapter 31</p>
   </title>
   <p>It was after twelve and the bottle was empty when the phone jangled again. I groped it off the hook. A crisp voice that didn’t want any back talk asked me if I was Mr. Shaw.</p>
   <p>“I think so,” I said. “Just a minute while I check.”</p>
   <p>“I am Mrs. MacDougall, at Holy Cross Hospital. A patient―a Mr. Fellows―wishes to speak to you urgently.” Her tone implied she couldn’t imagine why.</p>
   <p>“How is he?”</p>
   <p>“Mr. Fellows is not yet out of danger. Kindly don’t excite him.”</p>
   <p>“That’s jake at this end, lady,” I said. “I’m under sedation myself.”</p>
   <p>She gave a ladylike snort and went away and a thin splinter of Stan’s voice said, “Joe, I let you down. But it hit me like a dropped piano. I’ve been worried―”</p>
   <p>“Stan―where did you get that tuna sandwich?”</p>
   <p>“From the drugstore in the lobby.”</p>
   <p>“You bought it yourself, personally?”</p>
   <p>“No; Chick, the hop, fetched it around.”</p>
   <p>“Stan, did Miss Smith make any calls while you were on?”</p>
   <p>“Nope, not a one, Joe. I would have called―”</p>
   <p>“Who took over for you at the desk?”</p>
   <p>“That would be Wally Frink.”</p>
   <p>“Friend of yours?”</p>
   <p>“I’d trust him with a buck―as long as I was holding one end of it. Don’t tell him anything you don’t want the corner newsboy peddling an hour later.”</p>
   <p>I wished him well and gave him back to Mrs. MacDougall and rang up the Dockweiler, asked for the desk. A sharp little voice that would never miss an implied slur answered. I asked for Frink.</p>
   <p>“Speaking.”</p>
   <p>“My name is Shaw, Mr. Frink. I’m a friend of Stan Fellows. I understand you took over for him yesterday.”</p>
   <p>“That’s right. I’ve been on duty almost twelve hours already, and the rest of the night to go. What about it?”</p>
   <p>“Can you tell me if a Miss Smith, registered in 507, made any calls before she checked out?”</p>
   <p>“You with the police?”</p>
   <p>“Private,” I said. “I checked Miss Smith in―”</p>
   <p>“Look, fellow, this isn’t that kind of hotel. And if it was it’s not our policy to divulge information on our guests.”</p>
   <p>“You’ve gotten the wrong impression, Mr. Frink. As I said, I’m a private investigator. Miss Smith is my client. She checked out unexpectedly and I need―”</p>
   <p>“That’s none of my affair.”</p>
   <p>“All right, Frink,” I said the way they say it around a cold cigar. “I know where you live. Don’t make me get tough.”</p>
   <p>“Wha-a-at did you say?” It was a yap like an indignant Peke.</p>
   <p>“And I know all about Chick,” I added.</p>
   <p>That netted me some silence.</p>
   <p>“Give, Frink. Any calls, yes or no?”</p>
   <p>“I’ll check,” he said, and I could almost hear his teeth grit. He came back on the line.</p>
   <p>“No.”</p>
   <p>“That’s definite?”</p>
   <p>“What did you mean . . . about Chick?” Cautious now.</p>
   <p>“You know, Frink,” I said heavily. “You know.” and hung up. So Ellen hadn’t called Uncle Frank. But he’d known where to find her.</p>
   <p>I picked up the phone and called a friend at the Desert Wind in Las Vegas. For once the direct dialing worked. He came on the line to an accompaniment of clattering slots and shrill laughter in the background.</p>
   <p>“Nick, I want you to check something out for me. A Frank Prendergast is supposed to be spending a few days in the hell town with his nieces.” I gave him their descriptions.</p>
   <p>“Hell, Joe, if I had a buck for every old coot in this town shacked up with a snazzy young brunette I could retire into some honest job like splitting twenties.”</p>
   <p>“Check around anyway. He may be registered under his own name.”</p>
   <p>He said he’d try and hung up.</p>
   <p>I went back in the bedroom and dressed. I didn’t have any definite plans; I was just getting dressed. It seemed like the thing to do. I mixed another drink and sat for a while and stared at the chessboard. The pieces seemed to be waiting for something to happen. I knew how they felt. Outside, the wind was getting up. It made a busy, impatient sound in the trees under the window.</p>
   <p>After a while the phone rang again. It was Nick Rassias.</p>
   <p>“I find your party’s known here in a small way, Joe,” he said. “He’s a pigeon who drops respectable dough on occasion. But he hasn’t been around for some months.”</p>
   <p>I thanked him and poured a small drink while I digested the data. Then I tucked the lock box under my arm and rode downstairs.</p>
   <p>The Olds was waiting under the pepper trees where I’d left it. I drove to the office, went up just long enough to lock the papers in the safe, then headed west for Mayfair Heights.</p>
  </section>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 32</p>
   </title>
   <p>No lights showed in the Prendergast house. I did my usual cagey trick of parking down the block and walked back. The wind tossed the trees, shook the hedges. Dry leaves scuttled along the sidewalk with a furtive sound. A big iron lock held the big iron gates. Half-concealed wires suggested that bells would ring at Headquarters if anyone tinkered with it. The wall to either side didn’t look promising. Uncle Frank would be just the boy to set broken glass in the top. I went back to the wooden gates, still latched open, and stood in the shadows long enough to let any policeman staked out nearby to get nervous and start creaking shoe leather.</p>
   <p>Nothing happened, except that some clouds blew across the moon, making the shadows sharpen and then fade. I eased through, went up on the turf beside the hedge that bordered the Prendergast drive. The tunnel through it was all the way at the back, almost against the house; not obvious, but not too hard to find when you knew it was there. It had probably been a convenient route for a couple of generations of Delias and Jessie Mays with a yen for gossip or a companionable snort or a cup of sugar. I used it and was in the Prendergast car yard.</p>
   <p>Miss Mianne’s El Dorado was there, looking sharklike and eager in the moonlight. All four garage doors were closed. No dim lights burned at obscure windows at the side of the house. I thought about the dog―Robbie―and his commando training. It gave the seat of my pants, not to mention my jugular, a vulnerable feeling. But if the family was away, the dog wouldn’t be roaming around loose. From the look of it, they hadn’t left any servants behind. Nobody here but us private detectives, out getting a little fresh night air.</p>
   <p>I went once around the house, walking like Hiawatha sneaking up on a dozing moose, then jimmied the back door and went in.</p>
   <p>There was enough moonlight to show me the kitchen, neat and orderly and big enough to serve up a banquet for an orgy of congressmen. It was kind of homey to be back. It was a room I had bled in―one of the many. I went across it and into the hall and sampled the night sounds there: some wind in the eaves, a creak or two, the thump of unpruned vines against the window―nobody-home sounds. I sniffed; there was a faint medicinal odor―not strange in a house where an invalid had just died. I went on along the hall, past the spot where I had last seen Mrs. Prendergast. Nobody there this time. I looked in the library, and the dining room. Everything neat, and very, very still. I checked the sunroom, where I had been parked the first time I’d come to call. The drapes were drawn; a thin line of silver moonlight lay across the hard rug. I parted the hangings and looked out at an empty terrace, black lawn, moonlight on the closed garage, the distant line of trees, proud and aloof as captive kings.</p>
   <p>I went back to the hall and along to the kitchen and opened doors and found a pantry and a laundry and an equipment room and a neat little back stair almost as steep as a ship’s companionway. I went up it and emerged in a small room under the slant of the eaves, furnished with a narrow bed, a cheap dresser, an oval hooked rug, a bookcase with a few paperbacks and an ash tray, and empty wastebasket, and a small closet full of bent coat hangers. A door opened into a miniature bath with a sink, water closet, and a steel shower stall. Another door opened into the upstairs hall.</p>
   <p>Obviously a servant’s room, but no servant in residence.</p>
   <p>I tried doors along the hall. The first one was spacious, done in pale blue, with a big four-poster and gauzy curtains and a sitting room adjoining. It was the room where I’d seen Mianne brushing her hair just after the dog didn’t bite me. The adjacent room was locked. None of the gadgets I had with me opened it. I put an ear to the door and listened to some silence.</p>
   <p>Mrs. P.’s room had been made up. I stared in at the big bed and sniffed the faint perfume that lingered there. Not really so faint at that, and not the same scent I remembered from my last visit. That bothered me a little, but not enough to phone anybody about.</p>
   <p>The next room was Ellen’s. It looked a little untidy, as if it had been made up in a hurry. Well, it’s not every day a girl gets to go to Las Vegas or wherever Uncle Frank had taken her instead. She could be excused a little sloppy housekeeping. A small, lacy handkerchief lay on the floor beside the vanity. I picked it up, sniffed it, didn’t smell anything. I put it in my pocket. A Souvenir of Your Visit to the Prendergast Mansion. Why was I here? I didn’t really know. I seemed to be looking for something. Maybe I’d recognize it if I saw it. Or maybe not. I went on to the last room.</p>
   <p>There was a desk, a dark rug, a single bed with a tailored spread in a chocolate brown, a rocker, a comfortable-looking brown leather chair, a small bar. Uncle Frank’s lair, no doubt.</p>
   <p>A dozen or so suits hung in the closet, all with custom tailors’ labels. A row of highly polished shoes were on a rack below, plus a couple of shoe boxes he hadn’t gotten around to opening yet. I looked inside. They were full of the smell of new leather, plus the new leather itself.</p>
   <p>I pushed aside a hatbox on the shelf and was looking at a featureless ovoid the size of a human skull. It was mounted on a chromium-plated shaft set in a walnut base. It was an item that might have saved some grief if I had seen it the first time I came snooping, but now it was just anticlimax.</p>
   <p>I poked through Uncle Frank’s effects without finding any handwritten confessions tucked away in the drawers, no telltale jottings on the back of an envelope, no receipts from experimental labs for an order of contaminated lobster. Nothing you wouldn’t expect to find in the quarters of a luxury-loving old sponger taking it easy in the silk.</p>
   <p>I stuck my head in a couple of bathrooms and a linen closet big enough to supply a couple of regiments, then went back down to the front hall and stood in the dark, listening for something, testing the air with the delicate Shaw antennae. There was a faint odor of furniture polish, a hint of cigarette smoke, a touch of perfume, the errant whiff of medicine.</p>
   <p>Or possibly more than an errant whiff. I sniffed harder. I was right. It was more than a whiff. And it wasn’t medicine. It was chloroform.</p>
   <p>My gun got into my hand without me having much to do with it. I faded back against the wall as if to cut down the number of directions they could come at me from. Nothing else happened. The wind blew, the vines thumped at the windows, my heart beat.</p>
   <p>Come on, Shaw, what’s a little chloroform? Maybe it’s not even chloroform. Maybe it’s cleaning fluid, or floor wax, or disinfectant. Maybe it’s your imagination. Maybe it’s those five drinks you had.</p>
   <p>No, six―but who’s counting?</p>
   <p>The still air stirred; the taint of chloroform was as distinct as a footprint in wet sand. It was coming from the direction of the kitchen. I went back, silent as a shadow, silent as a foreclosed mortgage, silent as an obituary column, silent as two deaf mutes at a seance. At least I didn’t fall over an umbrella stand. I edged the kitchen door open. A faint but distinct current of fresh air hit me in the face.</p>
   <p>I closed the door to let the odor concentrate again. It was there, then it wasn’t there. I sniffed cautiously, like a man testing for poison gas. I didn’t smell a thing. And suddenly I was smelling it in a wave. I went toward it, toward a blank wall of dark paneling. I felt over it, tried a soft rap. It rang hollow. It took me another minute to find the latch. A wide door, with the top cut at an angle to fit under the stairs. The dark space behind it reeked of chloroform. There were cardboard boxes here, a mop rack, buckets, a vacuum cleaner and attachments, a shelf of soap powder and waxes. A patch of white on the floor at the back caught my eye: a piece of cloth, protruding from under the wall. That made it a second door. I found the knob and turned it. Chloroform came out in sickening waves. In the dark behind the opening, something moved. A dark shape half rose, launched itself at my knees. Teeth clicked, a heavy body sprawled past me. Claws scrabbled against the floor. A low growl rumbled and subsided in heavy panting.</p>
  </section>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 33</p>
   </title>
   <p>I knelt beside the dog. His yellow wolf’s eyes moved, following me. There was no fear in them. He had saved what he had and used it all on one last try and missed. There was no more where that came from. He lay quietly on his side and waited for what came next.</p>
   <p>“All right, Robbie,” I said softly. “Good boy, Robbie. You’re all right now, boy. Now you can breathe. Just work on it, boy. Everything’s OK now.”</p>
   <p>Whoever had tried to kill the dog had been in just a little too much of a hurry. They’d gotten him inside, then tossed the rag in after him. It stuck in the door. That let in just enough of a draft at floor level.</p>
   <p>The big dog’s tongue moved as if he wanted to swallow, but couldn’t quite make it. His front legs twitched hard once, and subsided. The eyes went vague and out of focus. The panting faltered. I reached out and put a hand on his side. Under the coarse hair and the curve of ribs I could feel a light, rapid pulse, like a trapped hummingbird.</p>
   <p>“Come on, Robbie. Let’s go, boy.” I hooked fingers under the big horsehide collar and hauled him halfway to his feet. His forepaws made aimless paddling motions. His hindquarters were inert, a dead weight. I dragged him out into the hall and ten feet along it, then back. His panting was stronger. Or maybe I was just choking him to death. I got an arm under his barrel and one under his chest and lifted him. When I let go he collapsed, like a bag of wet laundry. He was a big dog. He must have weighed close to ninety pounds. He lay on his side and panted, not even looking at me now.</p>
   <p>I went back in the kitchen and found the cooking sherry, poured some in a dish, brought it back and put it under his nose. That brought his head up an inch or two. His big rough tongue came out and spilled a little of the sherry around.</p>
   <p>I tried the collar grip again, and we did a few more laps. His front legs seemed to be taking a little of his weight now, like a colt taking its first steps. I was feeling a little light-headed myself. The reek of chloroform was cloying as syrup.</p>
   <p>“Fresh air, Robbie,” I said. “A nice walk in the fresh air. Let’s go, boy.”</p>
   <p>I maneuvered him through the swinging door, across the kitchen, down the back steps. Going down, his rear quarters came to life enough to throw his weight against my legs and almost trip me. We had another rest and tried it again.</p>
   <p>It was twenty-five paces to the garage. At the end of three round trips he was walking like a weekend drunk on his way to the men’s room to pass out. After another ten minutes I let him try it alone. He stood for a moment with his legs spraddled, tried a step, and went over sideways. But he was up again in the same motion, and went over the other way and lay there, panting. It was all a lot of damned foolishness. To hell with it. He lay and watched me, breathing better now, but still a lot of very sick dog. I got him on his feet again.</p>
   <p>We walked and rested. The moon came out and took a look and went in again. Robbie walked, stumbled, caught himself, walked, fell, got up and tried it again. I sweated and changed hands on the collar and reached the garage doors and started back. How many laps? Say twenty. Call it seventy feet. That’s under a quarter of a mile. Keep going, Shaw. It’s tougher on Robbie than it is on you. One more lap. One more. And one more.</p>
   <p>At the end of an hour he was walking unassisted. He weaved a bit, and his hindquarters still had a tendency to drop out from under him, but he was walking. I went back in and got our bottle, took a healthy swig, and poured another slug for Robbie. He drank it in a businesslike way and his tail tried a small wag or two. He looked around for more. He’d live.</p>
   <p>“Who did it to you, boy?” I said. “Who wanted you dead? And why stuffed in a closet? That’s careless―very careless. Unless they were planning on coming back very soon to tidy up . . . .” Robbie lay down, and put his chin on his paws and his tail thumped the ground once or twice.</p>
   <p>“Come on, Robbie, let’s go,” I said. He got to his feet and came over wobbling a little, and nosed the bottle hopefully.</p>
   <p>“All right, just one,” I said. “Then we’ve got work to do.”</p>

   </title>
   <p>I drove over to Fountain, cruised along looking for a sign I remembered seeing stuck in a small front lawn, a veterinarian’s shingle.</p>
   <p>I found it in the fourth block: a tan frame house with green-shingled gables. The sign read: Dr. I. L. Very. Veterinary Medicine. Office Hours 9―4.</p>
   <p>There was a bright light on in the back room. I pulled in the drive and went around to a side door and worked a brass knocker. A dog yapped somewhere out back and a crabbed voice shushed him. Feet crossed a floor. The door opened inward and a dim little man with frameless glasses and a narrow head of wispy hair peeked out at me. He was wearing a dirty pale green surgeon’s smock with rusty stains on it.</p>
   <p>“I’ve got a sick dog in the car,” I said. “OK if I bring him in?”</p>
   <p>“Do you have any idea what time it is?” he said sharply. His voice matched his face; small, pinched, and expecting the worst.</p>
   <p>“Swell; I’ll bring him in,” I said, and went back to the car. I had a little trouble getting Robbie on his feet. He lurched and leaned against me like a mild-mannered drunk. The vet watched us come, stood aside to let us in.</p>
   <p>“It’s after ten o’clock,” he said. I could hear his fee going up from where I stood. I patted Robbie and he flopped down on the linoleum and looked dazed.</p>
   <p>“What seems to be the trouble?” the little man said. He sounded reluctant to get involved.</p>
   <p>“Somebody tried to chloroform him,” I said.</p>
   <p>The dim little eyes got tight and sharp behind the pinkish lenses. They flicked toward the telephone on the wall over the kitchen table, back to me.</p>
   <p>“That sounds like a matter for the police, Mr. . . . ..”</p>
   <p>“Shaw. The police have a lot on their minds, Dr. Very. I walked him some and gave him a little sherry.”</p>
   <p>“Sherry? Sherry? The dog?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah. This dog right here, Doc. He still doesn’t feel good, in spite of the sherry.”</p>
   <p>“How do you know?”</p>
   <p>“He told me. Look, Doc―”</p>
   <p>“I very much dislike being called ‘Doc,’ Mr. . . . .</p>
   <p>“Shaw. Sorry, Doctor. Say, would it be OK if you took a look at the dog―while he’s still breathing, I mean? We can talk afterwards.”</p>
   <p>“You’ll have to help me get him up on the table. I can’t handle an animal of that size alone.”</p>
   <p>We lifted Robbie onto the table. Dr. Very looked at his eyes, handled his head some, stared into his mouth. He put a stethoscope to his ribs and frowned and moved it around. He examined his paws.</p>
   <p>“He’s weak,” he said, as if someone might dispute the point.</p>
   <p>I didn’t say anything.</p>
   <p>“How did this happen?” He looked at me like a smalltown high school principal waiting for an explanation of the frog in the inkwell.</p>
   <p>“I dunno, Doctor. I just happened along. He was locked in a closet. At first he couldn’t stand.”</p>
   <p>“How long ago was this?”</p>
   <p>“About an hour and a half. When I found him, that is. I don’t know how long he’d been in there.”</p>
   <p>“Hummph. You came along just in time, I’d say. Fine animal. Worth good money, assuming he has papers.</p>
   <p>Broken tooth.” He looked at me quickly to see if that netted any response.</p>
   <p>“He broke it a long time ago. He used to be in the Army.”</p>
   <p>Dr. Very got all set to be offended and I added, “In the K-9 Corps; you know.”</p>
   <p>“Well, he’s a valuable dog. Where did you say this happened?” He sneaked a look at the brass tag on the collar. If his expression changed, I couldn’t tell it.</p>
   <p>“Near here. How about giving him some oxygen?”</p>
   <p>He shook his head. “Not necessary. He’ll be all right. I’ll give him a shot of atropine. He’ll sleep it off in a few hours.”</p>
   <p>He twiddled with needles in an autoclave, filled one, picked a spot on the dog’s flank, and jabbed. Robbie paid no attention. Very put the needle away and wiped his hands and said, “That will be twenty-five dollars.”</p>
   <p>I gave him the stony look. “For a shot of atropine?”</p>
   <p>“That―plus my time . . . plus knowing to give him a shot of atropine.”</p>
   <p>“Would that include kennel fees for a day or two?”</p>
   <p>“I wouldn’t want any trouble,” Very said in a low voice. I looked at him casually and waited.</p>
   <p>“There’s blood at the edges of the mouth,” he said, looking at my tie. “Not his blood.”</p>
   <p>“Oh?”</p>
   <p>“And there are fibers between his teeth, and adhering to his claws. Wool fibers, I suspect. Clothing, in other words.”</p>
   <p>“Seems as though he may have bitten somebody, you mean.”</p>
   <p>“An animal of this size and breed is quite capable of killing a man, Mr. Shaw.” Dr. Very wiped his forehead with the cuff of his smock.</p>
   <p>“I see what you mean. But I didn’t find any bodies. Just the dog.”</p>
   <p>“My fee doesn’t cover trouble with the police,” he said quickly.</p>
   <p>“Sure not, Doc. Doctor. How much would trouble with the police run me?”</p>
   <p>“One hundred dollars?” He said it in a tight-lipped murmur as if he didn’t want anybody to overhear it, even me.</p>
   <p>“Thanks, Doc,” I said. “I’ll keep that in mind.” I paid and took the dog and left.</p>

    <p>Chapter 35</p>
   </title>
   <p>The streets were almost empty at that hour. I drove over to Santa Monica, cruised aimlessly west past closed stores as bleak as a pauper’s funeral, past all night cut-rate liquor stores as garish as a Chinese wedding, past used-car lots like elephant graveyards, as gay as a rainy day at the orphanage.</p>
   <p>An orphanage in Florida, a long time ago. Three baby girls and a man named Pate. And out West, an aging Harvey Prendergast with a new wife, maybe regretting his break with his son, maybe learning of his grandchildren for the first time, maybe commissioning his brother Frank to find them and bring them back.</p>
   <p>But one of the girls is missing, adopted or dead. So, with Pate’s help, a small substitution is made. Harvey acquires his family. Time passes. And one day Pate hits town. He knows things. He makes threats. He dies.</p>
   <p>You’re doing swell, Shaw. Familiar ground, but let’s go over it just one more time.</p>
   <p>Here’s Frank, sitting pretty. Here are the Prendergast heiresses, one of whom might not have been an heiress―might still not be―if the truth were known. Here’s Mrs. Prendergast.</p>
   <p>Correction. Not any more. She died. And Ellen knows something that worries her uncle. She ran away, but she came back―maybe.</p>
   <p>She hadn’t called Uncle Frank while Stan Fellows was on duty; maybe not at all.</p>
   <p>I pulled over beside a lighted phone booth at the corner of a vacant lot and got out and shuffled through the book. I was lucky; the page I wanted was still there. Lieutenant Dreyfus was off duty, but Pincus came on, sounding peeved at being caught at the office at this hour―or at something.</p>
   <p>“Frank Prendergast’s not in Las Vegas,” I told him. “I don’t suppose he gave you any alternate destination?”</p>
   <p>“You mean so we can reach him in case we find out he’s lying? He must of forgot. Who says he ain’t in Vegas?”</p>
   <p>“A friend of mine who’d know. I’d kind of like to get in touch with him in a hurry. Any ideas?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah―keep the snoot out of the Prendergast case. There ain’t any―”</p>
   <p>“I know. There ain’t any Prendergast case. Say, you might look into a case of botulism over at Holy Cross. Stan Fellows, day clerk at the Dockweiler. Seems he took sick suddenly―about an hour before Ellen Prendergast checked out.”</p>
   <p>“The Prendergast dame, huh? Holding out again. You think she slips the guy something?”</p>
   <p>“It’s an angle,” I said. “Well, you’ll have to excuse me now, Sergeant. I’ve got a big wash to hang out.”</p>
   <p>I hung up with the feeling I’d blown my chance for some cooperation from the police. The problem seemed to be in just how to phrase my appeal:</p>
   <p>“Say, fellows, I happened to be out burgling the Prendergast house and I found a chloroformed dog. And Uncle Frank wears a wig. So how about putting out an all-points on him and his niece.”</p>
   <p>Of course I could just call up and tell them I had a funny feeling. Pincus could have some fun with that one.</p>
   <p>I wasted another twenty minutes calling airlines and railroad reservations offices trying to find out if Frank and his nieces had bought any tickets under their own names. If they had, no one was letting on.</p>
   <p>I started to step out of the booth and checked automatically as a car rounded the corner down the block. The headlights swept across a gray VW parked in the side street, facing the intersection. A head inside it ducked down just as the lights hit. The car went past, making noise from a rusted-out muffler. The racket faded; the street was dark and quiet again.</p>
   <p>It was a temptation to leave the door open; with the light on I made such a tempting target. But I toed it shut and dropped a dime and dialed.</p>
   <p>A voice that was tired of being tough told me Lacey wasn’t on the duty roster that night. Add a dime to the expense account. I dialed his home number. After ten rings somebody picked it up and fumbled the receiver and growled what might have been a greeting.</p>
   <p>“Lacey, how long since I asked you a favor?”</p>
   <p>“Geeze, don’t you guys ever sleep? Not since yesterday, anyway. Why?”</p>
   <p>“I’m in a booth on Santa Monica, just west of Robertson. How soon can you get a carload of law over here?”</p>
   <p>“Run into something you can’t handle alone? Good for you, boy, I thought the day would never come.”</p>
   <p>“The years bring all things. In case the bird flies, it’s a gray VW, not too new, with a crease in the left front fender. I’m in my Olds.”</p>
   <p>“Uh-huh. Any chance of you saying what it’s about?”</p>
   <p>“It’s a swell pinch, Lacey. Don’t haggle.”</p>
   <p>“I’ll see what I can do.”</p>
   <p>I saw movement at the corner. “Hold it.” The VW was easing back out of sight, still showing no lights.</p>
   <p>“Oh-oh. They smell something. Check with you later.” I racked the phone and sprinted for the car. Robbie was stretched out on the floor in back. He didn’t move as I got in. The car stank of chloroform. I cranked up and tooled away from the curb and up to the corner. No VW.</p>
   <p>That put it up to them. I held it at thirty-five and drove west, watching the rearview mirror. At the second light I slowed with a lot of braking and turned left into Doheny. I made three blocks before they came into view in the mirror. I went on to Wilshire, turned right. Through Beverly Hills I speeded up. The VW closed to a block and a half. I gunned it again as the road split the golf course, followed the curves through Westwood, past the high hedges and the big comfortable dark houses. A few lights shone in the college buildings, far away behind trees.</p>
   <p>On the straightaway through Santa Monica I boosted it up to fifty and held it. The VW dropped back. If there was anybody working me from ahead they were doing it with plenty of velvet.</p>
   <p>At the beach I turned north, eased it up to sixty; they stayed with me, well back, but edging closer. Not yet, boys. Not here. Be patient. I’ll think of something. I pictured the road ahead, tried to remember the lie of the land. It had to be soon, before I got into the stretch north of San Vicente. I came on the spot before I knew it.</p>
   <p>It was a small patch of county beach, pocketed between low bluffs, with too many rocks for surfing and too much cold wind for lovers, which was why it was county beach. I swung in, followed an access drive back a hundred feet to a blacktop parking lot drifted over with blown sand. I nosed the Olds up against the log barrier and cut the engine. I locked both doors and used the button to lower the window on my side six inches, then raised it an inch. That looked about right. I checked the magazine of the Luger, jacked a round into the chamber and clicked the safety off, tucked it under my thigh, out of sight.</p>
   <p>Robbie lay quietly in the back; I spoke to him and he pricked up his ears. “Easy, boy,” I said. He closed his eyes. He’d had a long day.</p>
   <p>I lit a weed and tried to look like a man who had sought out some solitude to think things over. A mosquito came and checked me out and went away again. The dash clock clicked, an impatient sound. Back up on the highway a car droned past. Down below the surf thudded monotonously. After a while there was another sound: the soft creak a shoe makes on dry sand.</p>
   <p>A face slid into view at the window beside me. It was Rosie, the Cuban, and he was smiling. I smiled back and blew smoke at him and shook my head. He tried the door; it didn’t give. He lifted a small black gun of the kind you see in a police display of confiscated hardware and poked it at the glass, talking over it:</p>
   <p>“You got company, palsy. Come on out and play.”</p>
   <p>I slapped casually at an imaginary mosquito on my neck to cover a quick glance at the other window. Sid was standing back about six feet looking across the top of the car.</p>
   <p>“Careful,” I said to the Cuban. “That’s bullet-proof glass.”</p>
   <p>“You got a bullet-proof head,<emphasis> hijo?”</emphasis> He snarled and jammed the gun through the opening. I hit the button and the glass closed on his hand and the gun banged and a slug whined into the headliner. He yowled, and the gun bounced off the back of my seat. Robbie came up fast, growling. Sid made a noise and started around the front of the car; I scooped up the Luger and hit the horn button. Sid jumped six feet and landed facing me. His gun was halfway up; mine was aimed through the windshield at the spot where his eyebrows grew together.</p>
   <p>His hands went up, still holding the flat automatic that looked like an Austrian Steyr. I soothed the dog over my shoulder, then pushed the door open, riding the Cuban back, and got out. Rosie cursed rapidly in Havana gutterese and yanked at his hand. I shoved the door shut. Robbie was down out of sight again.</p>
   <p>“The wrist will give before the glass,<emphasis> amigo,”</emphasis> I told him. “Just relax.” I jerked the gun at the tall one. “Your arm gets tired holding it, Sid. Let it fall.”</p>
   <p>He opened his hand and the automatic thudded in the sand.</p>
   <p>“You made a bad mistake, bo,” he said in a voice from a haunted cellar. “We ain’t working solo.”</p>
   <p>“Two bits you’re not working at all when word gets back how you handled this one,” I said. “Kick the gun behind you and put your hands in your pockets.”</p>
   <p>“I’ll be there when they cut your neck,” the Cuban snarled, with a lot of saliva. “You squeal like a pig when the knife goes in.”</p>
   <p>“You’d know, wouldn’t you,<emphasis> amigo?</emphasis> By the way, you ever find your chopper?”</p>
   <p>He kicked at me and missed and lost his balance. His wrist made an ugly sound when his weight came on it. He screamed until he got his feet under him. The noise was thin and unimportant against the background of the surf. He leaned against the side of the car, breathing noisily through his nostrils.</p>
   <p>“Your color’s not so good,<emphasis> amigo,”</emphasis> I said. “Maybe you don’t get out enough. Where’s your boss tonight?”</p>
   <p>“Deal,” the man by the front of the car said in a hollow whisper. “We give you a clean bill. You go your way, we go ours.”</p>
   <p>“Easy, huh?” I said. “When you hold cards, you win. When you don’t it’s a misdeal. Nice system―if you can make it work.”</p>
   <p>“We don’t talk,” the Cuban gasped between his teeth.</p>
   <p>“Let’s you give it a try, Dracula,” I said to the other one. “Who sent you punks out?”</p>
   <p>Instead of answering, he put his head down and charged with his hands halfway out of his pockets. I clipped him above the ear and he hit the door jaw first and went down under the car. The impact hadn’t helped the Cuban’s wrist any. He was sprawled back across the hood, slack-jawed, half out on his feet, moaning.</p>
   <p>“Shiner must be hard up for good boys,” I said. The Cuban stopped moaning and unpeeled himself from the car. He even managed a ghastly sort of grin.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry for you, peeper,” he whispered.</p>
   <p>I got a grip on an ankle in a maroon sock and dragged Sid out where I could see him. He was out cold, but breathing well. I checked his pockets, then the Cuban’s. Their names were Sid Sidoris and Carlos Vaquez. They were both licensed drivers, and both had matches from a place called the Spezzia Club, a chisel-town dive. Rosie had a well-used leather sap on his hip. I tossed it in the car, lit another cigarette, and nudged the gaunt man with my foot.</p>
   <p>“Sid needs his rest. Let’s you and me talk, Rosie. Where’s the girl?”</p>
   <p>He drew a breath to spit at me and I doubled my fist and hit him hard under the ribs. He went to his knees and gagged. When he was through I said, “Where’s the girl, Rosie?”</p>
   <p>“See c-can you m-make me talk, peeper.”</p>
   <p>I grabbed his hair and dragged him to his feet and slammed him back against the car.</p>
   <p>“You’re not getting the picture, Rosie. This is my turn at bat. That makes you do the talking. Now, you’re a pretty hard boy. Maybe Sid will give first. So why make it tough?”</p>
   <p>He tried to knee me and I hit him again in the same spot. This time I didn’t let him go down. I held him up and grinned at him. “I can’t afford to let you stay clammed, Rosie; you can see that. It’s just one of those situations. Where is she?”</p>
   <p>He was sagging, his legs splayed. Blood ran down from his hp where he’d bitten it. One tough Cuban. The gaunt man groaned and an outflung hand scratched at the pavement. I pushed Rosie away.</p>
   <p>“Well, here’s Sid. Maybe Sid will want to tell me things. How about it, Sid?” 1 got a couple of handfuls of coat front and hauled him up and threw him back against the car. He hung on and breathed hoarsely. His eyes glittered at me.</p>
   <p>Up on the highway, brakes squealed. The sound seemed to go on for a long time. Then a long, splintering crash, and sudden silence.</p>
   <p>The gaunt man lurched away from the car and started to run. I hooked his ankle and laid the Luger against the side of his head. He dived forward and lay still. I went around to the other side of the car and rummaged in the glove compartment and brought out a set of GI bracelets. They made a bad fit on Sid’s ankle. I dragged him back and hoisted his leg up high enough to get the other cuff on Rosie’s good wrist.</p>
   <p>A flashlight winked and bobbed on the drive. I faded back into the deep shadow of the sandbank. A man came across toward my car. The beam touched Rosie and Sid, held on them. I moved back, around the curve of the dune.</p>
   <p>The VW was parked thirty feet away in the sand. The driver’s door was open. I flashed my pen-cell on the front seat and floor, then slid in back of the wheel to check the glove compartment. I found a much folded city map, another match folder from the Spezzia Club, a stack of gas receipts. Maybe the boys were on an expense account.</p>
   <p>There was a leather jacket in the back seat. The pockets gave up a flattened packet of Cuban cigarettes, a dirty handkerchief, a brass key with a tag. On the tag, in faded ink in neat handwriting, were the words,<emphasis> beach house.</emphasis></p>
   <p>I tucked the key away and went back around the sandbank. A gun jabbed me in the side.</p>
   <p>“Don’t shoot, officer, it’s just us chicken thieves,” I said.</p>
   <p>“I thought I heard something,” Lacey said. “You’re lucky at that, boy; I could of been two other guys.”</p>
   <p>“Sure―that’s why I took to the tall brush. How’d you find me?”</p>
   <p>“Like I said―luck. I figured you to hold west. I came on out and gambled you was ahead of me. You cost the county some money tonight. Them other two guys I could have been are up on the highway picking their windshield out of their teeth. The poor boobs tried to curb me. Gunderson’s watching ‘em bleed.”</p>
   <p>“The other half of the team. They worked me from in front. I never spotted them.”</p>
   <p>We went over to the car and Lacey shone his light on the Cuban’s face. His eyes glistened almost sleepily under half-closed lids. Sid was lying on his face; the pants leg had slid down on his cuffed ankle, showing the white of his shin above the sock. He didn’t move.</p>
   <p>Lacey gave me a sideways look. “Seems like these boys had an accident too.” He knelt beside the gaunt man and put his fingers into the side of his neck. He moved the head on the long neck. He grunted and stood, dusted off his knee. He didn’t look at me. I had a sudden chilly feeling that didn’t come from the sea air.</p>
   <p>“Neck’s busted,” he said. “You must have been pretty riled at something, Joe.”</p>
   <p>It was my turn to feel Sid’s neck. It was cool―too cool. There was no pulse. I dug my fingers in hard; there was still no pulse. I straightened and looked at the Cuban.</p>
   <p>“Afraid he’d talk, eh, Rosie?” I said softly.</p>
   <p>“I guess maybe you better come on in with me and Gunderson, Joe,” Lacey said.</p>
   <p>“Sorry, Lacey. I’ve got a place to go first.”</p>
   <p>“Want to tell me about it?”</p>
   <p>“Would it change anything if I did?”</p>
   <p>Lacey sighed. He yanked the big service revolver out of his belt and stood with it pointed at the ground.</p>
   <p>“He was breathing fine five minutes ago,” I said. “He hadn’t sung yet, but he would have. Rosie had other ideas.”</p>
   <p>Lacey swung around to look at the Cuban. The Cuban sneered with one side of his face. Lacey waited long enough for me to club him if I was going to, then turned wearily to face me.</p>
   <p>“You know I got to take you in, Joe―long as I’m able.”</p>
   <p>“You forget―I carry a Luger, Lacey.”</p>
   <p>He looked at me sadly. “That’s no way to talk, boy.”</p>
   <p>“Even the best of cops gets gun-walked once in a while.”</p>
   <p>“What about Gunderson?”</p>
   <p>“I’ll take the back way.”</p>
   <p>He sighed again, a perplexed man in a complicated world.</p>
   <p>“You’ll come in in the morning,” he said dully.</p>
   <p>“Sure thing.”</p>
   <p>“I sure hope to God you know what you’re doing, boy.”</p>
   <p>I shoved Rosie away and slid into the seat and let the window down to free his hand. He sat down on the sand. Lacey looked at me sadly.</p>
   <p>“It’s still a swell pinch,” I said. He didn’t answer. I backed, drove around the end of the barrier, swung back up past the VW to the highway. Two cars rested at the side of the road, locked together. Broken glass glittered on the pavement. A big deputy with no hat ran forward as if to cut me off. I gunned around him and off down the road to the north.</p>

    <p>Chapter 36</p>
   </title>
   <p>North of Cape Royal, a string of motels of diminishing grandeur petered out into off-brand gas stations, a lone eatery, closed up and dark, a defunct red-hot stand. Then the hills moved back in, crowding the highway. Up high a light showed here and there from a house hung on the cliff like a brooch on a dowager’s bosom. The road curved and the rock pulled back far enough for a small gas station blazing with lights to crowd in under it. I swung in beside the pumps. A husky kid with a wide jaw and hair the color of bleached khaki came out whistling and wiping his hands on a wad of cotton waste.</p>
   <p>He nicked paint jamming the nozzle in, went around front and hoisted the hood, kept his head under it for all of five seconds and slammed it down, whistling all the while.</p>
   <p>“A rock ever drop on you from up there?” I said.</p>
   <p>He stopped whistling long enough to say “Nope,” and got right back on “Darn that Dream.” He smeared the windshield, gave the outside mirror a dab, strolled around back and polished the license plate, and leaned on the pump, watching the numbers go by. He was on “Ebb Tide” now, and having a little trouble with the phrasing.</p>
   <p>I got out a cigarette and waved it in the general direction of the cliff top.</p>
   <p>“Which one is the Prendergast place?”</p>
   <p>He shook his head, unpuckered, and said, “Don’t light up, mister,” and picked up the beat without missing a note.</p>
   <p>“Neat,” I said. “How’s about “Hora Staccato” for a big finish?”</p>
   <p>He grinned through the music and topped off the tank and racked the hose, said “Four-eighty.”</p>
   <p>I got out a ten and folded it lengthwise and held it so that he had to reach a little. I didn’t let go. He was so surprised he dropped “Stardust” in mid-chorus.</p>
   <p>“I don’t plan to blow it up,” I said. “The Prendergast place, I mean.”</p>
   <p>“Would I know, Jack?”</p>
   <p>“Don’t kid me―a connoisseur like you. Two sharp brunettes and an El Dorado―or maybe a Jaguar. And no husbands; just the old uncle.” I leered at him. “Or so they say.”</p>
   <p>“You mean maybe he’s not?”</p>
   <p>“You get the idea.” I let go the bill and he tucked it away.</p>
   <p>“Next right, about half a mile along.” He pointed with his ear. “First left off that. One of those redwood layouts with all glass on the ocean side and a carport on the roof. Say a mile altogether.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t tell me,” I said. “I can’t miss it.” T got in under the wheel. He puckered up to whistle and grinned at me out of the corner of his eye and said, “You figure maybe he ain’t the uncle?”</p>
   <p>“That’s not our problem,” I said. “All we want is our money.” I caught the beginning of a blank look as I pulled back out on the road.</p>
   <p>I almost missed the turn, which was tucked back in under a mass of wind-twisted eucalyptus crowding a dilapidated pergola with a salt-pitted metal plate that read<emphasis> Bonito Rise.</emphasis> A narrow road, well paved but overgrown, followed a cut that curved back up through dense growth. Low-growing branches of yellow pine and black oak almost scraped the top of the car. It was a road that was carefully maintained to give the impression of not being maintained at all.</p>
   <p>The odometer had clocked two-tenths of a mile when I saw the gravel drive branching left. A new-looking sign beside it said dead end―no exit. I switched to parking lights and turned in. The track climbed, twisting and turning around outcroppings of rock. When it seemed like I’d gone far enough I stopped and cut the switch and lights. I rolled down the window. The air smelled fresh and green and dark. Wind made moaning noises in the trees. Far below surf boomed with a dull, defeated sound.</p>
   <p>I checked the Luger, set the safety, and tucked it back under my arm. The braided-leather sap I had taken off Rosie was in the glove compartment. I stuck it down in my right shoe, inside the sock.</p>
   <p>Robbie stirred when I opened the door. I said, “Lie down, boy,” and he flopped back. The car still stunk of chloroform.</p>
   <p>I got over on the shoulder and prowled up past three more curves and saw the house.</p>
   <p>It was a complex of black shadows spread against black trees. Steep, one-sided gables thrust up here and there between stretches of flat roof. There was a sundeck with a railing around it, steps that went down among boulders as big as office safes.</p>
   <p>The drive widened out into a car yard under the big pines. I circled it, keeping to the grass along the edge. A double garage was cantilevered out over empty air. The doors were closed, locked. I used the pocket flash on the crack at the hinge side, made out the flank of a black car inside. Could be Uncle Frank’s. Or maybe not. There are lots of black cars.</p>
   <p>There was a door off the terrace and another at the foot of the steps, both solid planks, both locked. My key didn’t work in either of them. All the windows in reach were covered by metal gratings that would have been a cinch to remove with a D-8 and a length of one-inch braided steel cable. Outside what might have been the kitchen I thought I caught a faint odor of cookery. I sniffed again and wasn’t sure.</p>
   <p>If there was anyone inside, he was keeping very, very still. Off in the woods an owl hooted. A pine cone dropped on the roof and clattered down the slope and off the edge past the garage. It made a metallic sound, striking something below. I went over that way and leaned far out past the corner of the building and saw a small flagged terrace ten feet below, on the other side of a redwood guardrail. There were two galvanized garbage cans in the corner; it was one of these the pine cone had hit. The rock leading down looked steep but climbable.</p>
   <p>I got down there without turning more than two ankles. A neglected perforated steel table and two spring-mounted chairs covered with bird droppings and dried leaves were near the wall. The terrace extended around the corner and along the west side of a cut-back in the west front of the house; it ended in a blank wall with a flush door that matched the ones on the other side. I used my flash on a small window. It was double hung, with one large pane below and four smaller lights in the upper half, and almost dusty enough to obscure my view of a sheet of unpainted plywood nailed over it from the inside. I took off my coat and wrapped it around my fist and punched in the pane beside the latch. The glass dropped back against the plywood with what seemed like a lot of noise under the circumstances. The latch gave with some persuasion. I got the lower sash up and tested the spring of the plywood. It felt hopeful. I put a fist against an upper corner and leaned my weight on it. No luck. I folded my coat against it and jarred it with a couple of short right jabs. On the second one the nails came free with a sound like a shoat having his tail docked. Still no reaction from inside. I folded the plywood down out of the way and ducked inside.</p>
   <p>The car was Frank’s Mercury. The tail pipe was cold. I went around it and tried a door in the far wall. It opened on three steps going down into a service hall. At the far end an open door gave into a kitchen probably smaller than the one at the Beverly Hilton, and with less counter space. There was a big range, stainless steel sinks, two wall ovens.</p>
   <p>I went past a long table with a row of ladles and saucepans hanging from a rack above it and eased the refrigerator door open. Eggs, bacon, packaged cold cuts. What weekend guests might lay in for short stay. Beside the sink glasses and plates were racked on a drainboard. The hinge-top garbage can held potato peelings and grapefruit rinds that looked fresh. At least nothing had started to smell. I slipped the Luger out from under my arm and started across toward the swing door that looked as if it would lead to the main part of the house. I was halfway there when it banged open and light hit my eyes and a voice hammered out of cold rolled steel said, “Shed it and freeze, Jack.”</p>

   </title>
   <p>I couldn’t see the face behind the light but I recognized the voice of the Prendergast butler―if that was what he was. I stooped and put the Luger on the floor and straightened up with my hands well away from my sides. The light bobbed as he came toward me. I heard the swish and a sandbag like they use on the levee at Natchez hit me on the side of the head and knocked me a few hundred yards into a brick wall.</p>
   <p>. . . somebody was hauling on my arm. I found a couple of feet and got them under me, with some difficulty due to the tilt of the floor. My head swelled and shrank in time to the revolution of the walls. I should stay out of kitchens. I didn’t do so well in them. Somebody was saying, “What is it, Thompson?” in Uncle Frank’s voice. The ceiling light went on. A couple of men that looked like Uncle Frank were standing in the doorway holding dressing gowns close under their chins. Two Thompsons were closer, off to one side, standing flat-footed, covering me with automatics. It was all happening on a well-lighted stage somewhere on the far side of a thick glass wall.</p>
   <p>“Why―it’s Shaw,” the men that looked like Uncle Frank said. They stared at me. I got hold of my head and squeezed it back into shape.</p>
   <p>“What on earth are you doing here?” Frank said. There was just one of him now. The walls weren’t traveling quite as fast and the floor had leveled out some. “What’s the matter with you? Have you been drinking?”</p>
   <p>“Thompson got his sap out to show it to me and I ran into it with my head,” I said. “Careless.” I held on and felt seasick. Considering what I had for dinner it would be no great loss. Still, I hated to lose it in such nice company. I concentrated on breathing through my nose and the feeling subsided a little.</p>
   <p>“I asked you what you were doing here,” Frank said again, with a nice snap of authority. “How did you get inside?”</p>
   <p>“I guess Thompson forgot to lock up.”</p>
   <p>The butler growled and said, “He’s lying, Frank!”</p>
   <p>“Go check!”</p>
   <p>Thompson didn’t move. “I better stick around,” he said flatly.</p>
   <p>Frank let it go at that. “Who told you about this place?” he asked me.</p>
   <p>“You could call it common knowledge.”</p>
   <p>“Nonsense. I value privacy. I happen to have gone to some trouble to keep the location confidential.”</p>
   <p>“In this town? You know better, Mr. Prendergast.”</p>
   <p>“Very well, now that you’ve ferreted it out, what is it you want here?”</p>
   <p>“I want to talk to my client.”</p>
   <p>“What? He’s not―” He checked himself. “I never employed you, Mr. Shaw.”</p>
   <p>“Miss Ellen. She paid me a retainer. I wanted to give it back. I don’t think I earned it.”</p>
   <p>Frank’s lips tightened up. “She’s told me of your misguided efforts on her behalf. You may keep the fee.”</p>
   <p>“I’d like to be fired in person, if you don’t mind,” I said.</p>
   <p>“Don’t be absurd. As I told you over the telephone, this family has no further need of your services. I can’t imagine what you expected to accomplish by intruding here; I have every right to telephone the police and have you thrown in jail. However . . . “ He let the threat trail off.</p>
   <p>“Good idea,” I said. “I’d feel better if I paid my debt to society. I was just kidding about the door. I busted in through the garage.”</p>
   <p>Frank snorted. “You’re a fool. This nonsense has gone far enough. You may leave now, Mr. Shaw. Kindly don’t come back―ever.”</p>
   <p>“Well, frankly, Mr. Prendergast, I’m not too happy about my client. I know you said she was with you, but I’d kind of like to see for myself. You understand.”</p>
   <p>“Your arrogance is beyond belief. Thompson, show him out. And see that he leaves.”</p>
   <p>Thompson jerked his chin toward the door, holding the gun nicely centered on my rib cage. “Lift ‘em, Jack. Let’s go. Out―like Mr. Prendergast said.”</p>
   <p>Uncle Frank held the door. I went through it, staggering a little more than was strictly necessary. Thompson followed me along a wide carpeted hall, up two steps into a dining area, across that, down three steps into a big wide room with glass all along one side. There were low chairs arranged around a fieldstone fireplace; more chairs in conversational groupings. Soft light from an archway on the far side fell on a table with a silver ice bucket and a decanter, threw highlights off brass tools beside the fireplace. A curved stairway cantilevered from the wall led up to a railed gallery. I made it across the room without breaking anything, went up three wide carpeted steps past an acanthus in a teak tub, into another passage with a slab door at the end.</p>
   <p>“Hold it there, Jack,” Thompson said. “Face the wall.”</p>
   <p>I followed orders. He sidled past me, unsnapped a latch, threw the door open. The smell of pines flowed in.</p>
   <p>“Out. I’m right behind with the heater.”</p>
   <p>Outside, he switched on a flashlight, played it across teak decking, wooden steps. Halfway up, I stumbled more or less intentionally. Thompson waited well out of reach, holding the light on me until I got up.</p>
   <p>At the top I stopped. The stars looked bright as Christmas tree ornaments.</p>
   <p>“Nice night,” Thompson said. “Where’d you leave your heap?”</p>
   <p>“Down the road.”</p>
   <p>He shone the flash along that way.</p>
   <p>“Show me.”</p>
   <p>He stayed ten feet behind. My shadow bobbed against the trees; my back felt as wide as a ranch gate. A hundred yards from the house I stumbled again and went down harder than I meant to. This time I got the sap out of my sock and into my hand.</p>
   <p>“Come on, on the feet, gumshoe,” Thompson said. “We got a little farther to go.”</p>
   <p>“I’m pretty dizzy,” I said. “I have to rest.”</p>
   <p>“You’ll get plenty rest, pal.”</p>
   <p>“I’m going to be sick,” I said, and stayed where I was. Thompson swore and took a quick step toward me and swung his foot. I leaned away from it and swung the sap at his ankle―the only part of him I could reach. It wasn’t a bad swing, considering. It connected just above the arch and I heard and felt bone go. Thompson made a gargling noise and the gun banged and stabbed flame into the gravel. I hit him in the ribs with my shoulder and carried him back and down, rolled clear and came to my knees. I had the gun now. He tried to get up and the broken ankle folded and he went down hard on his face. While he was down I laid the sap behind his ear, not gently. He spread himself on the drive and snored. I picked up the light and went through him. Aside from a switchblade in his side pocket, a set of Japanese folding brass knuckles on his hip, and a .25 Walther in a shoulder rig. he was unarmed.</p>
   <p>It took me a few minutes to hog-tie him with his belt and tie, and drag him over to the side of the road. The mosquitoes were pretty thick over there, but he wouldn’t mind that. I left him there and started back up toward the house.</p>

    <p>Chapter 38</p>
   </title>
   <p>There was a glow behind a skylight; a little light leaked out from behind closed drapes along the living room side. I went down the wooden steps and across the teak deck and put an ear against the door. No sound came through it. I teased the door open and was back inside. Voices came from somewhere, a low murmur without meaning. They got louder as I went along the hall. Somewhere a door banged open; feet scuffled. I went flat against the wall next to the potted plant and got the Luger into my hand and heard Frank say, “Damn you, girl, listen to me!”</p>
   <p>More scuffling, with heavy breathing. They were in the living room now. There was the meaty sound of a blow, then feet coming toward me. I felt for a light switch and found it and a soft glow sprang up behind a cove just under the ceiling. Ellen Prendergast was at the foot of the steps below me. She stopped dead and stared up at me with eyes that looked as big and blank as black pansies. The sleeve of the little blue jacket was torn, a button missing. Her face was pale to the lips and she was breathing between her teeth in harsh gasps, like a winded runner.</p>
   <p>“Private fight?” I said. “Or can anybody get a knuckle in?”</p>
   <p>Uncle Frank was across the room, near the fireplace. His face was haggard and old, twisted into an expression like one of those stone faces that spout water. A small nickle-plated automatic lay on the rug in the center of the room. Frank’s eyes jumped to it.</p>
   <p>“Uh-uh,” I said. “It’s not that kind of party.”</p>
   <p>Ellen made a faint whimpering sound and started to sway. I went down the two steps and got an arm under her. Frank edged sideways, looking past me.</p>
   <p>“Thompson won’t be along for a while,” I said. “He got tied up.”</p>
   <p>“Y-you have no r-right,” Frank started to babble. “We―you’re intruding in a family affair!” But his voice crumbled like stale bread. I walked Ellen over to the nearest chair and she slid down into it.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry,” she whispered, and sat up straight. “That was foolish of me.”</p>
   <p>I picked up the .22 and dropped it in my pocket. Uncle Frank reached for the decanter on the table, poured himself a couple of fingers of brandy. His hand shook so that the glass tinkled like little bells. The bouquet drifted across to me as smooth as an angel’s wing, but he put it back in a lump like bar whisky. He touched his tongue to his lips and braced his shoulders a little. I holstered the Luger and got out a cigarette and tapped it on my thumb.</p>
   <p>“Expecting Miss Mianne soon?” I said.</p>
   <p>“That is none of your affair,” Frank said. His lips looked gray. His face was the color and texture of the kind of paper they wrap apples in.</p>
   <p>I nodded. “By the way,” I said, “the cops have Rosie and Sid.” I fit the weed and let some smoke drift along the room. “Maybe that’s a break for you after all, Frank. Or maybe not. It’s a fine point.”</p>
   <p>“I haven’t the faintest idea what you’re talking about,” Frank said, barely moving his lips.</p>
   <p>“Oh―I almost forgot,” I said. “Rosie talked some. Sid didn’t talk. He’s dead. The cops have an idea I did it. You can see the spot that puts me in.”</p>
   <p>“I’m not in the least interested,” Frank started to whisper, but I waved that away.</p>
   <p>“That line was all right yesterday, but things have happened since then. I don’t have time for the coy play. I have most of the picture but there are a few gaps you could fill in.”</p>
   <p>Frank said, “Get out,” but not as if he expected anybody to move.</p>
   <p>“It was the snapshot of Harvey that tipped me first, Frank,” I said. “It showed a man who was nearly bald, way back in the early forties. You and Harvey looked alike in those days―but he still had hair when he died; the news clips showed it combed the way vain old men comb their last few locks―straight across, like J. Paul Getty. Nobody would invest in a hair piece with that much scalp showing through. So it was real, and it was your silvery mane that was the rug. And the pic was you, not Harvey―which tied you to the orphanage.”</p>
   <p>Ellen made a little sound and turned to look at me with a strange expression.</p>
   <p>“How much did Harvey pay you for his grandchildren, Frank?” I said.</p>
   <p>“You’re raving,” Frank said in a voice as faint as the promptings of conscience.</p>
   <p>“Sure. Just let me rave a little. Harvey had heard about his son’s marriage―of which he no doubt disapproved―and the birth of the twins. When the parents died he had a change of heart. He wanted the children. But he didn’t know where they were. You did. One of them was in an orphanage at Tampa. You paid off a man named Pate and he handed her over. So far so good.”</p>
   <p>Ellen was staring at Frank across the room with a look like the one just before the scream. He was holding one of his bony hands with the other, as if it might get away and bite him. He took a couple of tottery steps and sank down in a chair.</p>
   <p>“You’re distorting the facts,” he said. “You make it sound like something . . . underhanded. Of course I helped him find the children. After all, I was his brother―”</p>
   <p>“Sure. You tried to kill him once, and almost made it. He let you off the hook. I wouldn’t know why. Maybe he took the brotherly end of it more seriously than you did. I don’t know how the trouble started between you. Maybe it was just the fact that you started together and he finished way ahead. That would be hard to take, I guess.”</p>
   <p>“It was nothing like that. Harvey was a cold man. He threw his son out of the house, cut him out of his will. The boy came to me. When he and Connie were killed I was left with the infants. I had no way to care for them. I placed them with a home. What else could I have done?”</p>
   <p>I didn’t answer that one. He didn’t wait for me to.</p>
   <p>“I admit at first I was not inclined to have anything to say to Harvey. I felt he didn’t deserve to have the children, a man like that. Then later―well, I saw I had no right to keep them from their patrimony.”</p>
   <p>“I guess there’s nothing in my idea that you hid them out until he was in a mood to deal generously.”</p>
   <p>“That’s fantastic. It was just as I told you―”</p>
   <p>“There’s another question that nags at me, Frank. You knew there was money to be made from the twins. How come you let one of them get away?”</p>
   <p>A ripple ran along his upper lip like a sneer looking for a place to park.</p>
   <p>“I was not responsible for that. The man Pate . . . “ He tried to clamp his jaw shut, but it kept on quivering.</p>
   <p>“What happened, Frank,” I said gently. “Did he hit her too hard?”</p>
   <p>Frank’s face seemed to fall in on itself a little more. It wasn’t much more than a skull now, with the clownish wig askew on it.</p>
   <p>“Well, there you were, Frank,” I said. “You had a deal―but Harvey was paying for an unbroken set, and you were one baby short. But luckily Pate could help you out. Maybe that’s how he saved his neck. He tipped you to where you could pick up a replacement. It wouldn’t be a matched set―but there are such things as non-identical twins―like you and Harvey. So you traced the Conroys West and bid her in. Harvey paid off. Everybody was happy.”</p>
   <p>“Lies,” Frank muttered. “Distortions. I was concerned only with the welfare of my nieces.”</p>
   <p>Ellen laughed suddenly, not the nicest of laughs. It had that dizzily balanced sound, like squirrels on a tightwire.</p>
   <p>“Oh, yes. Uncle Frank was always concerned for the welfare of his nieces.”</p>
   <p>“Well, the years passed,” I said. “Times got tough.</p>
   <p>You and Harvey didn’t get along, but still, there was all that money. You got to thinking and you came up with an idea.”</p>
   <p>There was a slight draft on the back of my neck. I moved a step sideways and gave Miss Ellen a reassuring smile that ricocheted off her face and died.</p>
   <p>“Here was Harvey Prendergast, rich, stiff-necked, pompous, publicity shy. With two daughters who were really his granddaughters. And one of them not even that. There had to be money in it. Hitting Harvey with it might have worked, but only in a small way. Harvey was a man who liked a buck as well as the next fellow, even when the next fellow was you. You could embarrass him, but not more than a few grand worth. There had to be a better angle.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know why I’m listening,” Frank said.</p>
   <p>“It wasn’t a thing to be gone into hastily,” I said. “The operation called for planning, and patience. Plenty of patience.</p>
   <p>“Of course, there were the Conroys. They knew things. They’d been paid off, but they might get restless when they got wind of the new dividend. But they didn’t really count for much. They were the kind of people who never really had a chance. They’d struggled a little against what heredity and environment had for them, had even made a little progress. But the easy money and the thing they’d had to do for it had knocked that out. The ten grand was gone fast; maybe for the down on the house. Then all they had was the little voice that came in the night. That, and maybe wondering now and then how the baby was making out, if the man who said he was her uncle was treating her right. But they were no real threat. A visit, a few hints, a little cash, took care of that. The coast was clear.”</p>
   <p>Frank undamped his hands and let them creep across his chest. His eyes looked past me; his mouth hung open. He made a strangled noise.</p>
   <p>“So you contacted the false Miss Prendergast, told her who you were, told her the story―or parts of it. She was a girl with great expectations―but not if Harvey Prendergast found out who she was: a nobody―a waif who’d been rung in on him. Personal relationships didn’t mean much to Harvey, but Family was everything.”</p>
   <p>Frank shook his head, slowly, as if he was testing his neck. His mouth opened and closed; a thin sound leaked from the corner of it.</p>
   <p>“You figured you were solid, Frank. You couldn’t miss. But she fooled you. She told you to go to hell. And that created a problem. You hadn’t figured on that. The threat was good―as long as the victim played ball. But if Harvey threw her out on her ear it didn’t mean a dime to you.”</p>
   <p>“I told him . . . I was glad,” Ellen said, in a high, rapid voice, like an old maid reporting a rape attempt. “I hated my life, hated my father, hated being who I was, where I was. I didn’t care. I laughed at him. I told him―at least now I didn’t have him as an uncle.”</p>
   <p>I didn’t look at her.</p>
   <p>“But you had one more round in the chamber, didn’t you, Frank? The other girl. A bluff might work. You gave her the pitch―not mentioning how you’d struck out the first time. And she believed you.”</p>
   <p>Ellen leaned forward toward her uncle. “You―you vicious old liar,” she said. “You promised me―”</p>
   <p>“She believed you,” I said, “maybe because she was old enough to remember a little. Fred and Mae, the long trip, the strangeness. She’d always had the feeling she didn’t quite belong in the big house.” I went across and stubbed out the cigarette in an ash tray like a ten-pound ice block that had been melting in the sun. Frank’s eyes followed me. I’d seen customers at the morgue who looked healthier.</p>
   <p>“She swallowed your story, didn’t she, Frank? Hook, line, and fisherman.”</p>
   <p>“Ellen,” Frank croaked. “Get my doctor.”</p>
   <p>“Things looked good―for a while,” I said. “Then they started to go a little wrong.”</p>
   <p>I poured some of Frank’s brandy into a glass and slid it across my tongue. It felt good. I swallowed the rest.</p>
   <p>“Funny thing about a man like you, Frank,” I said.</p>
   <p>“You feed your own hungers―but you never stop to think there might be other appetites around. Appetites that are used to the big table, that won’t share, that aren’t content with scraps.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe I’d better call the doctor,” Ellen said.</p>
   <p>“Maybe later,” I said. “For a careful man, you didn’t cover your trail very well, Frank. First, Rosie and Sid: I thought for a while they were just some of Lou Anglich’s old Tampa chickens coming home to molt; but Lou dropped out of sight, and they were still with me. I dropped a few hints here and there as to where I might be going next. The ones they picked up were the ones I fed to you.</p>
   <p>“Then there was the matter of the timing the day Mrs. Prendergast died. You came home at a bad time―bad for you. If I hadn’t been there first, things might have been awkward.”</p>
   <p>“Are you trying to imply . . . ?” Frank let it hang there. I could almost hear him thinking it over.</p>
   <p>“You lied to the police about going to Las Vegas, Frank―when there was no need to. That’s dangerous business, even without an unsolved murder or two lying around on the books.”</p>
   <p>“I told you―”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, you told me. And who told<emphasis> you,</emphasis> Frank?”</p>
   <p>He looked at me with his mouth open.</p>
   <p>“All along you’ve behaved like a man taking orders, Frank. Someone’s been doing your thinking for you. And you’ve been going along―building the platform, getting the rope all ready, adjusting it around your own neck. You even picked the hangman, and all along you’ve been telling yourself you were in charge.”</p>
   <p>“That’s―that’s impossible―insane―”</p>
   <p>“Uh-uh, Frank. You’ve been kidding yourself long enough. It’s time to wake up and take a good look at a few things. She didn’t look like that kind of girl―but do they ever?”</p>
   <p>Frank Prendergast stiffened in his chair; his feet, in shiny wing-toed shoes, slid forward on the rug. He raked at his chest.</p>
   <p>“It’s his heart,” Ellen said, in a crisp voice, like a dedicated fan explaining a tricky play around left end. “I really think I must get help for him.”</p>
   <p>“After a while,” I said. “It was a little ironic that after the ringer gave you the horse laugh, the real Prendergast girl believed you. Those are the little surprises that make life interesting. But you had another surprise in store―maybe bigger than the first. You had pointed out to the young lady that if Harvey got the idea she was no relation of his, she’d be out of his will faster than an option dropping. But instead of folding like a show hanky all ready to be slipped into your pocket, she took a more direct approach. She killed him.”</p>
   <p>Ellen gave a little scream and twisted her fingers together until the knuckles went white.</p>
   <p>“It wasn’t hard,” I said. “A good squirt of red hot botulism culture on his sandwich, and she was out of range of any nasty rumors. And after all―it wasn’t as if she was really committing patricide. Harvey wasn’t really her father―or so you’d convinced her.”</p>
   <p>Ellen came up out of her chair. Her eyes were a little wild. She said:<emphasis> “You</emphasis> killed my<emphasis> father!”</emphasis> and jammed her knuckles into her teeth.</p>
   <p>“Afterwards she spelled it out for you: play ball or she’d pin it on you. You were in a spot. You’d tried to kill him once. You had motive and opportunity. And when they started digging, they’d find you had a record back in Florida. You could spill the whole story, but who’d believe an old ex-con when she batted those big innocent eyes and cried a little? She was covered. There was nothing to tie her to the spiked sandwich. And she was smart enough even then not to overplay her hand. She had you on a rope, but she wasn’t ready to hang you. Not quite yet. She was a girl who could look ahead. She was living under false pretenses, eating high on somebody else’s hog. That could all disappear in a minute―if there was someone else out there who knew the story. That meant she had to get hers quick, before the bubble popped. And for that, you’d be useful. She told you all this. She had you cold. So you played along.”</p>
   <p>Ellen turned and lunged for my pocket. I caught her wrists; she was a strong girl.</p>
   <p>“Give me the gun,” she whispered. “He’s evil, evil!”</p>
   <p>I pushed her back into her chair and held her there until she went slack and started to cry quietly.</p>
   <p>“The trick was to loot the estate without attracting too much attention. That was where you came in, Frank. You knew the ins and outs of business―especially dirty business. You knew who to pay off, how to work it. You saw to it that funds were shifted from the conservative investments Harvey had socked away to chancier propositions―the kind that fold suddenly in the night, leaving a bunch of trimmed shareholders wondering where the capital went. Rex London helped out there. You channeled a lot of your take through his tables on a percentage deal―a good enough cover for some of the outflow of cash, if they didn’t dig too hard. And why should they?”</p>
   <p>Ellen sobbed. Frank shook his head and made noises that didn’t even try to be words.</p>
   <p>“Everything seemed to be working swell; and then Lou Anglich hit town, showing a picture of a child and asking questions. And he had a picture of you, Frank. That brought your old pal Pate out of the woodwork. He got to you, implied things, feeling for an opening. That worried you. You looked up a little man named Carlotti, an old acquaintance from Florida. He and a couple of other boys went out to have a talk with Lou. That didn’t work out. Lou dropped out of sight. He’d been seen at my office. Your boys tailed me back to Jaster. That was too much connection. The boys chilled him and shook down his office, but didn’t hit pay dirt. That left me for you to worry about. You didn’t really like all this killing, so the boys had instructions just to bend me a little. Something went wrong there, too. Maybe you needed some new boys, Frank.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Frank said in a monotone.</p>
   <p>“Mr. Shaw,” Ellen said. “I’ve heard enough. I can’t stand any more. All this deceit, treachery, violence, in my own family. It’s more than I can bear. Please―take me away from here!” She said all this in a rush, with heavy breathing.</p>
   <p>“There’s not much more to tell,” I said. “Jaster had something that had to be found. Maybe you had it, Frank. Your partner wouldn’t have put it past you to hold out. She got you out of the house and searched your room. No luck. Then she had a better idea. Maybe the old lady knew something. She asked her. Maybe she wasn’t satisfied with the answers. The conversation got out of hand. Mrs. Prendergast was pretty frail. Her neck broke. So she dumped her down the stairs and I showed up and she cracked me over the head and beat it out the back way.”</p>
   <p>Ellen stood suddenly; she hugged herself and shivered.</p>
   <p>“I can’t listen to any more of this,” she said, and started to turn away.</p>
   <p>“You don’t want to miss the punch line, Miss Ellen,” I said. She looked at me and shivered again; but she waited.</p>
   <p>“You might think a woman would lose her head after a close call like that,” I said. “But not this girl. She had found Lou Anglich. She knew all about Anya. She drove out there and told him who she was. When she asked him to go with her he went like a lamb.”</p>
   <p>“Why?” Ellen said. “Why . . . would she . . . ?”</p>
   <p>“She thought he might know things she needed to know. But you don’t crowbar information out of a man like Anglich. She had to play it with roses. That would take time. She had to get him off by himself and con him gracefully. But that didn’t pan out either. Lou didn’t tell her the things she wanted to know because he didn’t know them. He was no part of the shakedown. He was just a poor old roughneck, looking for a lost dream.”</p>
   <p>“Guesses,” Frank croaked. “Wild imaginings. How could you possibly know―” He stopped and looked surprised and sank back in the deep chair.</p>
   <p>“By this time it was pretty clear that things were coming apart. There were too many angles, too many people who knew too many things. It was time to get out. Most of the haul was already safely stashed somewhere, probably south of the border.”</p>
   <p>Frank uttered an exclamation.</p>
   <p>“Didn’t you know, Frank? But then you wouldn’t, would you? She was still stringing you along with the idea that you were partners, that in the end the two of you could sit back and enjoy the Prendergast name and the Prendergast fortune. The catch was, there isn’t any Prendergast fortune. Not any more. She cleaned it, Frank―she and Rex London. There’s not enough left in the kitty to finance a weenie roast for the help.”</p>
   <p>Frank made stuttering noises.</p>
   <p>“That’s why everything was set up for the big finale, Frank. That’s why she had you tell lies to the police, and why you’re here tonight.”</p>
   <p>“What . . . do you mean?”</p>
   <p>My cigarette had burned down. I lit another one while he stared up at me like a cancer patient waiting for the report on the X-rays.</p>
   <p>“You still don’t see, do you, Frank? You can’t get it through your head that a little girl you once bought and sold like a pet kitten could and would truss you up and throw you to the dogs.”</p>
   <p>Frank started to get up out of his chair; Ellen took a step back. They stopped, poised that way.</p>
   <p>“You’re the fall guy, Frank,” I said softly. “That’s what she kept you for all along. She didn’t really need you for the rest. Not even for what was planned for tonight.”</p>
   <p>“Tonight?”</p>
   <p>“It would have looked like murder and suicide. The heiress, murdered by her uncle, who then shot himself. The other heiress missing and presumed sunk in a lake somewhere. When they discovered the estate was stripped―and your hand would show up in that, not hers―the motive would be clear. You’d robbed the family till, lost the money gambling―she saw to it you planted a reputation for plunging on the tables. When your niece caught you out, you killed her, then blew your brains out in a fit of remorse. Neat, tidy, and not a bit too flashy for Mayfair Heights. How does it sound?”</p>
   <p>“Murder? What are you talking about?” Frank’s whisper was like a ghost asking himself where he’d taken a wrong turning, back when he was alive.</p>
   <p>“Get Mianne in here,” I said. “And we’ll see.”</p>
   <p>“Mianne . . . is in Mexico,” Frank whispered.</p>
   <p>“There’s a light on in an upstairs room,” I said. “Maybe you forgot about the skylight.”</p>
   <p>“There’s no one there, Mr. Shaw.” Ellen said in a tone of gentle reproof, like a nun reprimanding a novice for telling her beads too fast.</p>
   <p>“I’d kind of like to see for myself, Miss Ellen.”</p>
   <p>“Mr. Shaw,” Ellen said in a voice that was all alone on a tightwire, high above the crowd, “I’m going now.”</p>
   <p>“Uh-uh,” I said. “Not just yet, Miss Ellen.”</p>
   <p>“Would you . . . try to stop me?”</p>
   <p>I looked at her; she stared back at me.</p>
   <p>“Let’s go up,” I said. “You lead the way, Uncle Frank.”</p>
   <p>He levered himself out of his chair and gave me a look as empty as Pharaoh’s tomb; his hand fluttered at his throat. He turned and went past me toward the stairs. Ellen shivered again and followed him. I brought up the rear.</p>

    <p>Chapter 39</p>
   </title>
   <p>Frank stopped in front of a door.</p>
   <p>“The next one,” I said. He moved on to it. It was a nice slab of bleached teak with a fancy brass lock built into the outside. Frank tried the knob.</p>
   <p>“Locked,” he said, and looked vaguely puzzled.</p>
   <p>I got out the key I had taken off Rosie. They watched me try it, and I watched them watching me. It fit. The latch clacked and the door swung in.</p>
   <p>Mianne Prendergast was standing by an unmade bed. She was dressed in the same gray suit I’d seen her in three days before. Her black hair was swept severely back, tied behind. There was no make-up on her face. Her cheekbones stood out like ridges in the desert. The window behind her was boarded over, under the drapes. There was a rug, a chest of drawers, chairs, a door in the wall opposite the bath, a skylight in the slanted ceiling. It was a nice room but it smelled as frowsty as a cell at the Railroadmen’s Y.</p>
   <p>Mianne drew a deep breath and looked at me, past me at Ellen. Ellen came into the room, moving stiffly, like a cat in a strange kitchen. Frank sidled in and slid sideways along the wall and leaned there.</p>
   <p>“All present or accounted for,” I said. “Who wants to tell the rest?”</p>
   <p>Mianne shook her head slowly, like a TV nurse reporting no hope. Ellen’s face twitched. Frank looked at a spot on the floor between the two women.</p>
   <p>“Murder is like sex,” I said. “It can’t stand too much talking about. Let’s talk about it anyway. It’s here, in this room. I can feel it leering out of the wallpaper like a dirty old voyeur. Can you feel it, Frank?”</p>
   <p>He made a rather curious sound, something like an elderly owl might make, laying her first egg.</p>
   <p>“What about you, Miss Mianne?”</p>
   <p>“Go away,” she whispered in a voice with no more strength than a nonagenarian’s last wish.</p>
   <p>“Miss Ellen?”</p>
   <p>She looked at me. She was hugging herself again. She smiled a frail little smile, like a forget-me-not in the snow.</p>
   <p>“You’re playing with me, aren’t you, Mr. Shaw?”</p>
   <p>I shook my head. “Not me, Miss Ellen. The one who planted the plague in Harvey’s lobster salad had a cute taste for games. The routine with Jaster was a nice frolic―while it lasted. Mrs. Prendergast played one hand and lost. And it was a fun routine with Rosie and Sid. But tonight’s the big night. This is the climax, the pay-off. This is the night the killer gets well―and the play is with the house’s money.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t like allegories, Mr. Shaw.”</p>
   <p>I waved a hand. “There are four of us in this room.</p>
   <p>One murderer, two slated as victims, one patsy to take the rap and die.”</p>
   <p>“Really? Would you care to identify us?”</p>
   <p>“I’m victim number one. Too bad, I snooped too hard. I’ll have to go. And of course Uncle Frank will be the suicide.”</p>
   <p>“And the others, Mr. Shaw?” Ellen’s voice was as gray and fragile as a rope of ash.</p>
   <p>“Easy,” I said, and raised my voice. “Little Anya has to die too, for the killer to collect the prize.”</p>
   <p>I moved fast then, but not fast enough. The door six feet to my left exploded. Lou Anglich came through it like a switch engine hitting a roadblock, in a hail of splinters. I had my Luger halfway out; he slammed through me, bounced me against the wall hard enough to loosen my back teeth. The gun went flying somewhere. Anglich skidded to a stop, spun to face the room. His eyes were like the muzzles of a pair of smoking forty-fives.</p>
   <p>“Who’s gonna hurt little Anya?” he said, and took a step forward.</p>
   <p>“Wrong girl, Lou,” I said. “That’s not Anya.”</p>
   <p>Lou halted. He swung to look at me, like Goliath noticing David. His hands opened and closed. He said, “Hah?”</p>
   <p>“The other one is Anya,” I growled. “This one wants to kill her.”</p>
   <p>Anglich turned to stare at Ellen. Her arms that were folded, hugging her, unfolded. There was a shiny little automatic in her hand.</p>
   <p>“Stand back,” she said.</p>
   <p>Lou took a step toward her. He whispered “Anya?”</p>
   <p>The gun jumped, once, twice, three times. The shots were hard slaps of sound, and over the slaps the other slaps, of lead striking flesh. Lou stopped dead. Three red flowers bloomed suddenly on his rumpled white shirt, down low, just above the belt. He folded his arms carefully over his stomach, as if he were cradling a baby. He made a sound halfway between a grunt and a sigh. His mouth opened and closed. He turned his torso without moving his feet and went over sideways like London Bridge falling down.</p>
   <p>Ellen stepped sideways around him. The gun in her fist was as steady as the cornerstone of the Bureau of Standards. She reached the door and kicked it wide.</p>
   <p>“Mianne is coming with me,” she said. Skim ice was never more brittle than her voice. “For your good behavior, Mr. Shaw, I’ll free her at the border. Unless there’s trouble. You understand.” She motioned with the gun.</p>
   <p>Lou Anglich made a sound and drew his knees up. He got his hands under him and pushed his torso up a few inches from the floor. The expression on his face was of a man intent on an important task that wasn’t going well but which had to be done. The end of his tongue came out and touched the sweat on his upper lip. He frowned and fell on his face and blood came out of the corner of his mouth.</p>
   <p>Mianne made a small whimpering sound and went to him, knelt beside him. She lifted the big rough head into her lap. His eyes were half shut; the stubble on his broad cheek was like a smear of soot. His lips moved. Mianne leaned over him. Then he went still all over, with no more fuss than a cloud shadow passing over a hill.</p>
   <p>“Come along,” Ellen said. Mianne got to her feet. There was blood on her skirt. She went past Ellen into the hall.</p>
   <p>“Wait a minute,” I said.</p>
   <p>Ellen looked back at me. “Don’t talk, Mr. Shaw. You’re a clever man. I should kill you, of course; all of you. But I really hate killing. Wait two hours before you leave the house.”</p>
   <p>She pushed the door shut and the latch clicked. I listened to their footsteps until I couldn’t hear them anymore.</p>

   <p>Frank hadn’t moved, he stood against the wall in a half crouch, paying no attention to me. I went to the window. The plywood sheet covering it was three-quarters of an inch thick, screwed in place, solid. The skylight was too high and the angle of the roof too steep to do me any good. I leaned against the door. Long experience of butting stone walls with my head told me not to waste my time there.</p>
   <p>I went through the broken connecting door into the room where Anglich had hidden out. The hall door was locked, but it was just a door. I backed up and hit it with the old linebacker’s plunge and was out in the hall.</p>
   <p>There was light enough from the living room to get me down the stairs. A cold draft was blowing along the hall. The door to the deck was open. I went across and up the wooden steps and had one foot on the gravel when I heard the scream. Before it was finished another scream mingled with it. A dog barked once, a deep, hoarse baying. Then the shots, two of them, close together, like Chinese crackers. Then nothing.</p>
   <p>I had covered about a hundred yards when headlights went on down below. Mianne was standing in the road, silhouetted in the fight. The dog was on his side between her and the car, looking as big as a yearling calf in the pool of black that spread under him.</p>
   <p>Ellen lay huddled between the dog and the car. From fifty feet away I could see the tear in her neck, as clean as a razor cut.</p>
   <p>“He came out of the car like a thunderbolt, without a sound,” Mianne said in a voice as drained as a vampire’s victim. “She went down. Then the shots. Even then―so horribly hurt―she fought back.” She shuddered violently. “Poor Robbie. And poor Ellen. She wanted so badly to live.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t we all,” I said. “Come on. Let’s go back up to the house and call some law.”</p>

    <p>Chapter 41</p>
   </title>
   <p>It was a couple of days later. I was sitting in a hard chair in a room full of old cigar smoke and the smell of policemen. Lieutenant Dreyfus smiled at me across the desk. It wasn’t the kind of smile that warms an unfriendly world.</p>
   <p>“You played it just right, Shaw,” he said sadly. “Another death―two if you want to count Anglich―and an old man in the hospital on pure oxygen not expected to last another night. Nice work. Maybe if you’d confided in the Police Department some of that could have been saved.”</p>
   <p>“Sure―if I’d known anything. All I had was guesses. Hell, I wasn’t sure until I saw Mianne on her feet which one was the real killer.”</p>
   <p>His head cocked sideways like an alert robin tuning in on a worm.</p>
   <p>“You’d already seen Ellen shoot Anglich down―or so you stated.”</p>
   <p>“Sure; but that could have been panic. If she’d been a prisoner in the house this might have looked like her last chance. And she had no proof I wasn’t in on the plan.”</p>
   <p>He looked at me without a whole lot of approval. “It’s a lucky thing for you that you have a friend in the sheriff’s office. Lacey gives you a good character. He says you wouldn’t break anybody’s neck unless maybe you didn’t like them. So I guess we can chalk Sid up to Rosie. It won’t make much difference to him, where he’s going.”</p>
   <p>“That’s thoughtful of you, Lieutenant,” I said.</p>
   <p>“I guess we can chalk this Jaster up to the same account,” he said. “No point in smearing the girl’s name any further.” He looked at me sideways. “No matter what her name is,” he added.</p>
   <p>I did the business of getting out a cigarette and tapping it on my thumbnail. Dreyfus watched me, smiling a little sadly.</p>
   <p>“Kind of tough on a girl, one day an heiress with a family, next day an orphan and broke―or almost. Maybe I should have told her to stay around, but what the hell. She’s been through a lot. Mexico will be good for her, eh?”</p>
   <p>I nodded.</p>
   <p>He looked at the corner of the ceiling. “I guess she must have had a little something socked away in the sugar bowl for a rainy day, at that. Seems like she opened an account just before she drove south. Nothing important, you understand. Just a hundred and forty some grand, cash deposit.”</p>
   <p>I rolled the cigarette in my fingers, another of my suave mannerisms. “That so?”</p>
   <p>“Uh-huh. I don’t suppose the Treasury boys would be interested. If you’ve lost a million, a few thousand is just salvage, you might say. But you wouldn’t care about that. Nothing to do with you, eh, Shaw? You’re just a workingman, putting in his time for fifty a day and expenses.”</p>
   <p>“I’m thinking of bumping it to seventy-five,” I said. “Just to stay competitive.”</p>
   <p>Dreyfus yawned and stretched. “Yeah. We’ll call you if we get puzzled by anything.”</p>
   <p>I started to get up, but he went on talking:</p>
   <p>“I still don’t quite see what this Anglich person was doing, stashed at the Prendergast place. That connection’s not too clear.” He hooked an eyebrow up and looked at my chin.</p>
   <p>“Jaster got wind of him when he began nosing around the orphanages, flashing Anya’s picture,” I said. “He tipped Frank; Frank told the girl. They sent Rosie and Sid around to ask why, but that didn’t work out too well. So Ellen found out where he was hiding and went to see him. I’d guess she had the little gun in her bag―but she didn’t use it. She told Lou she was Anya, and he bought it. He told her things that made her decide he’d be nice to have alive, for the time being. She sweet-talked him out of his hole and into a room at the beach house. She kept him there the same way.”</p>
   <p>“He couldn’t have been too well hidden―if she found him.”</p>
   <p>“I did some wondering about that, too. Rosie and Sid were a possibility, but I’d already had my run-in with them. I was careful. Nobody tailed me. That means Lou must have phoned out. Maybe he got lonely and risked a call to my office and got the answering service. They could have strung him long enough to trace the call―if the price was right.” I mashed out the cigarette. “I changed answering services, this morning.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe. Or maybe you’re not as hot as you think you are. Anybody can be followed if somebody’s willing to take the trouble. Maybe Ellen Prendergast followed you herself. It didn’t have to be two men in derby hats.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe a lot of things, Lieutenant. Life is full of maybes. Maybe it doesn’t matter much―now.”</p>
   <p>“Academic,” Dreyfus agreed. “Like the question of why your man Pate gave Anglich the lead in the first place. He could have put him off with any old story.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe he did,” I said.</p>
   <p>Dreyfus looked at me alertly.</p>
   <p>“Pate was having his neck squeezed. He might have improvised a little. Throwing in Frank’s picture might have been his idea of a cute little trick, to muddy the waters. Maybe afterwards it got to seeming not so cute. So he came out to check up. He smelled money in it, and made the last in a lifetime full of mistakes.”</p>
   <p>Dreyfus nodded, looking thoughtful, in a sleepy-eyed way that had probably fooled a lot of crooks into underestimating him.</p>
   <p>“Anyway Anglich died happy, eh, Shaw? He thought he’d found her.” He grinned a cynical grin.</p>
   <p>“Who knows?” I said. “Maybe he had.”</p>
   <p>The grin got a little crookeder. “Yeah. As you say, who knows?”</p>
   <p>I got up. “Good night, Lieutenant,” I said. He shook his head and didn’t answer. I went out, along an empty hall, out into an empty street under an empty night sky. The car was waiting where I had left it under the pepper trees. I got in it and drove over to the office.</p>
   <p>There were no lights on there. My feet echoed in the corridor hke a caretaker making the rounds the day after the end of the world. Nobody was waiting for me in the anteroom. There was a musty, embalmed smell in my private thinking parlor. Maybe it was the odor of the private detection game.</p>
   <p>I got out the fresh bottle and checked to see if it was what the label said. It seemed to be. I administered another dose and opened the safe and got out the envelope with the birth certificates in it. I took another envelope out of my inside pocket and spread everything out on the desk. Two pieces of paper, yellow around the edges, and two glossy photographs of footprints, white swirls on black. I had lifted one from the bathroom of the apartment where Mianne had been locked up, with the help of a ten-buck tip to the cop on the door. The other had been supplied gratis by an old acquaintance at the morgue.</p>
   <p>I got a magnifying glass out of the drawer and looked at the prints of the naked female feet, and at the smaller prints on the certificates. I looked at them for a long time. I put the glass away and poured another sample of my tonic and drank that and listened to my watch tick for a while.</p>
   <p>I tore the papers into small pieces, starting with the birth certificates. I heaped the pieces in the big glass ash tray and lit a match and sat back and watched it burn. When it was all gone, I poked at the ashes with a pencil until they were black dust and dumped the whole mess into the wastebasket.</p>
   <p>The room was a little smoky; I opened a window and watched the gray tendrils drift out and add themselves to the smog layer that reflected pink light above the city. The night air smelled fresh and cool, with a hint of rain. Maybe tomorrow would be a nice day.</p>
   <p>“Another maybe,” I said. “Maybe everything’s coming up roses. Maybe life will unfold and you’ll get rich and happy and die in bed at ninety surrounded by loving faces crying a little, but not too much to spoil things. And maybe not.”</p>
   <p>Nobody answered. I rode the elevator downstairs and walked along the dark street and the rain was cool and sweet on my face.</p>
