    <p>Introduction</p>
    <p>by Samuel J. Umland</p>
   </title>
   <p>“It happens now and then,” T. S. Eliot wrote, “that a poet by some strange accident expresses the mood of his generation, at the same time that he is expressing a mood of his own which is quite remote from that of his generation.” Eliot made these remarks about Tennyson over fifty years ago, in a different age about a different writer, but his words aptly describe the relationship of Philip K. Dick to a generation of readers and critics which came of age in the latter half of the twentieth century, the age of the cold war. Just as Tennyson came to represent his age, or Johnson’s Shakespeare typified his, Philip K. Dick has come to represent the second half of the twentieth century. Though he died in 1982 at age fifty-three, Dick’s life was so propitiously placed that he was in touch with the major social and political convulsions of twentieth-century America.</p>
   <p>As a small boy in the early 1930s, Dick listened to the war stories of his father, who, as a teenage Marine, had experienced some of the most vicious fighting of World War I. After his parents divorced, he lived with his mother in Washington, D.C., in the mid-1930s, where he experienced firsthand the poverty of the Great Depression. Later, after he and his mother returned to California where he was to spend the rest of his life, he became fascinated, if not obsessed, with World War II, which also coincided with his preoccupation with German art and culture. After some time in a private school, he entered Berkeley High School early in 1944; finally, after three years rife with personal difficulties, he graduated in 1947. He briefly attended the University of California at Berkeley in the fall of 1949, where he declared himself a philosophy major, attending a class, by his own account, with the analytic philosopher Stephen C. Pepper.<sup>1</sup> Dick himself claimed that he inherited the left-liberal, anti-authoritarian politics of the Berkeley milieu, but he also, and perhaps most importantly, inherited the philosophical skepticism that has been one of the more profound and lasting effects of the cold war.</p>
   <p>In a life of unpredictable turns, one of the more unpredictable ones, with the longest-lasting and most insidious effects, was how Dick became entangled in the political intrigue of the cold war. Early in the 1950s, probably late in 1952, as a result of perhaps his own association and his then wife’s acquaintance with Communist Party fellow travellers on the Berkeley campus, Dick and his wife Kleo were approached by two FBI agents and recruited to spy on suspected enemy agents at the University of Mexico. The extent of his subsequent involvement with the FBI will forever remain vague, but <emphasis>his</emphasis> tangled relationship with the U.S. government that began that unspecified day in the early 1950s forever complicated his already troubled life, his thought, and his action, affecting both his personal relationships and his more overt clashes with authority. Moreover, both his fiction and his recorded interviews, as well as his correspondence, never ceased to make allusive references to the paranoia, the distrust, the suspicion, and the repressive domestic surveillance that emerged in post-World War II America.</p>
   <p>Knowledge of Dick’s biography is essential to an understanding of his work, yet in a remarkable irony, one of the effects of the cold war on contemporary literary criticism has led to the deliberate avoidance of an author’s biography as a primary methodological step. This is generally expressed in a form of the “biographical fallacy” that calls biographical evidence “psychologistic,” hence “reductive” and therefore “vulgar.” The historical and cultural contexts which coincided with the rise of New Critical commonplaces such as the “persona theory,” the “biographical,” “affective” and “intentional” “fallacies” are only now beginning to receive serious scrutiny.<sup>2</sup> In an irony that is thoroughly Dickian, William H. Epstein has revealed in his article “Counter-intelligence: Cold War Criticism and Eighteenth-Century Studies” the origin of the alleged critical “fallacy” known as the “biographical fallacy” as well as the “persona theory” in the late 1940s and early 1950s by literary scholars who were to become CIA employees or were to work closely, wittingly or unwittingly, with the intelligence establishment. The “persona theory,” for instance, is analogous not only to an author’s “cover story” but the critic’s, allowing the critic to authorize a critical interpretation by taking on an “assumed identity” that the text permits under the auspices of the putative authorial “persona.” Both the “biographical fallacy” and the “intentional fallacy” allow for much the same thing, a critical “gesture” or “way of sanctioning critical activity under the cover of some other activity” (64).</p>
   <p>Tobin Siebers observes that “modern criticism is a product of the cold war, and the repeated emphasis by the New Critics on objectivity, ambiguity, paradox, the impossibility of paraphrase, and double meaning are part of the cold war climate” (<emphasis>Cold War Criticism</emphasis> 30). Cold war literary criticism takes place in a paranoid analytical situation, in which the critic becomes something of a double agent like the utterly dissociated Bob/Fred duality of Dick’s <emphasis>A Scanner Darkly</emphasis> (1977), a novel that seems to have as much to do with double and triple agents as it does with the drug subculture. Dick had his finger on the pulse, and the pulse was an America beginning to dissociate under the stress of cold war paranoia, “a situation in which,” Epstein observes, “betrayal and patriotism are mutually reciprocal and virtually indistinguishable” (77). Dick’s first published novel, <emphasis>Solar Lottery</emphasis> (1955), makes allusions to “minimax” strategy which, as William Poundstone has shown in <emphasis>Prisoner’s Dilemma,</emphasis> was a developed by the brilliant mathematician John von Neumann under the auspices of the RAND Corporation explicitly as part of the United States’ cold war nuclear strategy (7, 52−59, 94−96.) (Dick was later to employ minimax strategy as a way to defend himself against the mysterious origins and motives behind the “Xerox missive” two decades later.) In <emphasis>Ubik</emphasis> (1969), Runciter’s “inertials” are given a thin SF veneer but are in fact engaged in nothing less than counterintelligence—or industrial espionage: “Counter-intelligence is the penetration of the enemy’s spy system and the prevention of his penetrating yours,” Epstein writes (84). Even a late novel, <emphasis>Radio Free Albemuth</emphasis> (written 1976; published 1985) reveals his obsession with domestic surveillance and his relentless dissection of the form of counterintelligence known as “collaboration.” Dick’s fiction is populated by assassins (Keith Pellig in <emphasis>Solar Lottery,</emphasis> Spence Olham in “Impostor,” Joe Cinadella in <emphasis>The Man in the High Castle),</emphasis> informers (Kathy Nelson in <emphasis>Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said),</emphasis> double agents (Donna Hawthorne in <emphasis>A Scanner Darkly,</emphasis> Vivian Kaplan in <emphasis>Radio Free Albemuth),</emphasis> agents with blown covers (Douglas Quail in “We Can Remember It for You Wholesale”), and triple agents (Roni Fugate in <emphasis>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch).</emphasis> Examples could be multiplied. Dick’s fiction was nurtured by the cold war and has been, in turn, criticized within that same cultural climate. Perhaps it is time to reexamine his life’s work, to open the entire <emphasis>oeuvre</emphasis> to scrutiny, and not simply talk about those few novels treasured by SF critics.</p>
   <p>The essays in this volume are, in many respects, attempts to reassess Dick’s fiction, investigating the fictions and ideologies of the popular critical modes which have structured our perceptions of it. The essays are united by their interest in a broad range of contemporary critical approaches to the fiction of Philip K. Dick, as well as by their commitment to the spirit of frank intellectual debate of a figure whose own range and complexity create writings that form a <emphasis>corpus</emphasis> which demands a reassessment. Many of the essayists chose to examine texts which have been unaccountably neglected in contemporary criticism of Dick and have found rich ore.</p>
   <p>The essays are roughly organized according to the decade in which the fiction appeared, following a loose chronological order beginning with an overview of Dick’s work. Carl Freedman’s essay, “Towards a Theory of Paranoia: The Science Fiction of Philip K. Dick,” is one of only two previously published essays reprinted in this volume. [The essay originally appeared in <emphasis>Science-Fiction Studies</emphasis> 32 (March 1984): 15−24.] Freedman develops a theory of paranoia drawn from Freud and Lacan that seems a particularly appropriate one for cold war America, and then he applies it to the animistic world depicted in one of Dick’s essential works, <emphasis>Ubik.</emphasis></p>
   <p>The next four essays primarily examine the novels and fiction of the 1950s. Neil Easterbrook’s essay looks at a key early short story, “Impostor.” While acknowledging the cold war context in which the story emerged, Easterbrook reveals the degree to which the story is uniquely Diekian. giving special attention to the motif of the double in Dick’s work. Karl Wessel’s essay seeks to explore the nature of Dick’s 1950s cultural critique as well as the philosophical foundations on which his work rests. Using an early and, as he sees it, important short story about the nature of collective paranoia, “Shell Game,” Wessel shows how a philosophical mistake Dick pursued in the story affected the rest of his career. Christopher Palmer, in his essay “Philip K. Dick and the Nuclear Family,” likewise argues for the importance of Dick’s cultural critique, offering a much-needed overview of Dick’s early short stories, arguing that “we still need to understand how [Dick] shaped (or mishaped) his fictions so as to reimagine the life of his society.” The “instability” of Dick’s “typical families” provides the framework of his discussion. My own contribution to the collection argues for the importance of the early occult fantasy, “Upon the Dull Earth,” and the reemergence of its themes throughout Dick’s career, using as examples the late short story “Rautavaara’s Case” and the novels <emphasis>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</emphasis> and <emphasis>VALIS.</emphasis> I attempt to resituate the study of Dick’s fiction in the context of his knowledge of esoteric and occult religions.</p>
   <p>The next four essays examine some heretofore critically neglected yet important novels of the 1960s. Anthony Wolk’s “The Swiss Connection: Psychological Systems in the Novels of Philip K. Dick” looks at the profound effect that reading the Swiss Existential psychiatrists as well as contemporary accounts of schizophrenia had on several of Dick’s novels in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including <emphasis>Time Out of Joint, We Can Build You, Clans of the Alphane Moon,</emphasis> and <emphasis>The Simulacra.</emphasis> Rebecca A. Umland proffers an unusual approach to the unaccountably critically neglected novel <emphasis>We Can Build You,</emphasis> suggesting that its theme of unrequited love suggests the range of Dick’s interests. Far from being a source study, she examines the rich play of references one can find in Dick’s fiction. As in Dostoevsky, love and pain are ineluctably linked by Dick, which explains his fascination with medieval paradigms of unrequited love. Gregg Rickman’s essay, which follows, also looks at <emphasis>We Can Build You,</emphasis> revealing the extent to which the novel is a reflection of Dick’s own dissociated psychology. Merritt Abrash looks at Dick’s critically neglected novel <emphasis>The Penultimate Truth,</emphasis> in an essay that originally appeared in <emphasis>Foundation</emphasis> (England) 39 (Spring 1987): 31−40 and hence has probably gone relatively unread in this country. Abrash is concerned, as are Freedman, Wessel, and Palmer, with Dick’s sense of the politics of simulation, deceit, and self-deception—a virtual rehearsal of cold war preoccupations. Jake Jakaitis’s “Two Cases of Conscience: Loyalty and Race in <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> and <emphasis>Counter-Clock World,”</emphasis> argues for the importance of those two neglected novels from the mid-1960s. Focusing on loyalty and loyalty oaths (the 1950s emphasis) and then on race (the 1960s emphasis), Jakaitis seeks to define the nature of Dick’s cultural critique. In the final essay of the collection, Michael Feehan applies the thought of Kenneth Burke to a discussion of Dick, a pellucid application given both thinkers’ interests in the religious experience. Feehan explores the theological concepts of “conversion,” “translation,” and “transformation” in the <emphasis>Valis</emphasis> trilogy, with particular emphasis on the novel <emphasis>VALIS.</emphasis></p>
   <p>My hope is that this edition will appeal to a wide readership—that it will provide an academic audience with a sophisticated theoretical reading of Dick’s fundamental thematics, but at the same time offer sufficient exposition for both students and a popular audience. The intent is to draw all readers into the serious interrogation of Philip K. Dick’s massive body of fiction. No other collection has attempted systematically to represent the diversity of recent critical debate about the nature of Dick’s fiction and its relevance to contemporary culture. I hope that this edition will suggest the future course of Dick studies in the spirit of frank intellectual debate.</p>
   <subtitle>A NOTE ON CITATIONS</subtitle>
   <p>Because there are no standard editions of Dick’s novels, and because there are various publishers and editions of Dick’s books, this edition uses a citational method in which references are made by chapter and page—for example, a reference to <emphasis>VALIS</emphasis> §10.156 means that the quotation can be found in chapter 10 of the novel and in the particular edition the critic has used, on page 156. A short story is cited by the particular volume of <emphasis>The Collected Stories</emphasis> in which it appears, followed by the page number—for example, 3:205, meaning volume 3 of <emphasis>The Collected Stories,</emphasis> page 205.</p>
   <subtitle>NOTES</subtitle>
   <p>1. Dick made this claim in an unpublished personal interview with Hazel Pierce on October 7, 1978. When asked by Pierce whether, during his short period as a student at UC Berkeley in the fall of 1949, he ever found someone to engage him in a Socratic dialogue, Dick responded, “No, I did get one-actually, my philosophy teacher . . . not my TA [teaching assistant] . . . my professor, his name was Dr. Pepper. One day I went down and I said to Dr. Pepper, would you explain to me the difference between Plato’s ideal state and the Soviet Union?”</p>
   <p>2. See Tobin Siebers, <emphasis>Cold War Criticism and the Politics of Skepticism,</emphasis> particularly his discussion of New Criticism and Wimatt and Beardsley’s “Affective Fallacy” (37−46), and also William H. Epstein, “Counter-intelligence: Cold-War Criticism and Eighteenth-Century Studies.” In an interview with Frank M. Ellis, the literary critic who proposed the “biographical fallacy” in an essay published in 1951, Epstein was told that he, Ellis, “consciously modeled” the “biographical fallacy” on Wimsatt’s and Beardsley’s “affective fallacy” and “intentional fallacy,” although “he cites neither of the essays that promulgated these interpretive guidelines” (94−95n14). Soon after the publication of Ellis’s “Gray’s <emphasis>Elegy.</emphasis> The Biographical Problem in Literary Criticism,” Ellis “took a leave of absence from Yale, joined the CIA, and helped set up ratlines in Frankfurt and Munich” (79). “Ratlines,” according to Epstein, were “clandestine escape routes” established to smuggle ex-Nazis out of Europe and funded by the CIA. Ellis and the future theorist of counterintelligence for the CIA, James J. Angleton, were friends, though Ellis and Angleton “were in different divisions of the CIA” (98n38). For a lengthy discussion of James Jesus Angleton and his essential role in American counterintelligence, see Robin W. Winks, <emphasis>Cloak and Gown</emphasis> (322−438).</p>

    <p>Towards a Theory of Paranoia: </p>
    <p>The Science Fiction of Philip K. Dick by</p>
    <p>by Carl Freedman</p>
   </title>
   <p>“The ultimate in paranoia,” writes Philip K. Dick,</p>
   <cite>
    <p>is not when everyone is against you but when <emphasis>everything</emphasis> is against you. Instead of “My boss is plotting against me,” it would be “My boss’s phone is plotting against me.” Objects sometimes seem to possess a will of their own anyhow, to the normal mind; they don’t do what they’re supposed to do, they get in the way, they show an unnatural resistance to change.</p>
    <text-author>(<emphasis>Best of Philip K. Dick</emphasis> 447)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>This comment on the early short story “Colony” has a direct and obvious relevance to representations that appear throughout the Dick canon. Examples include the Lovecraftian house-creature in <emphasis>Eye in the Sky</emphasis> (1957), the assassination machine which masquerades as a television set in <emphasis>The Penultimate Truth</emphasis> (1964), the comically insolent and litigious door in <emphasis>Ubik</emphasis> (1969), and the occasionally murderous car-repair factory in <emphasis>Deus Irae</emphasis> (1976). Rarely for Dick are objects what common sense would suppose them to be, and the will with which they are invested can even constitute a precise mimicry of such quintessentially “human” types as the benignly authoritative father (Kindly Dad in <emphasis>Martian Time-Slip</emphasis> [1964]) or the irresistible and dangerous sexpot (Rachel Rosen in <emphasis>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</emphasis> [1968], the major theme of which is the practical difficulty of distinguishing between human beings and one variety of objects).<a l:href="#n_1" type="note">[1]</a></p>
   <p>That objects have a will, and a quasi-human will, of their own is, of course, also an idea long familiar to historical materialism. <emphasis>Capital</emphasis> itself opens with the intricate analysis of the fetishism of commodities-definable as the process whereby “the definite social relation between men themselves . . . assumes here, for them, the fantastic form of a relation between things”—and some of the metaphors which Marx employs in explaining how products of human labor appear to be “endowed with a life of their own” have what one may be tempted to call a Dickian ring:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>The form of wood, for instance, is altered if a table is made out of it. Nevertheless the table continues to be wood, an ordinary, sensuous thing. But as soon as it emerges as a commodity, it changes into a thing which transcends senuousness. It not only stands with its feet on the ground, but, with relation to all other commodities, it stands on its head, and evolves out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas, far more wonderful than if it were to begin dancing of its own free will.</p>
    <text-author>(<emphasis>Capital</emphasis> 1:163−65)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>Since <emphasis>Capital,</emphasis> commodity fetishism has become a central category in many versions of Marxist cultural theory and has been developed and reformulated in various ways—as reification, for instance, by Lukács, and as counter-finality by Sartre. Yet Philip Dick, when writing discursively of quasi-living “things,“ chooses a term not directly related to Marxism at all but one drawn from the different science of psychoanalysis: paranoia.</p>
   <p>This apparent displacement, I suggest, is not necessarily a vulgar psychologistic reduction, but a potentially fruitful hint which may shed some light on the historical status of certain psychoanalytic categories, on the nature of signification under monopoly capitalism, and on the materialist reading of SF. In what follows I will outline a Marxist theory of paranoia and will then suggest its relevance to SF in general and to the work of Dick in particular, reserving my main critical emphasis for the novel which I take to be Dick’s finest, <emphasis>Ubik.</emphasis></p>
   <p>For Freud, the ideational structure of paranoia is that of a ruthless hermeneutic. In one essay, indeed, he defines the disease as “the hypercathexis of the interpretations of someone else’s unconscious.”<a l:href="#n_2" type="note">[2]</a> The point here is that the paranoiac has an abnormally high investment in the hermeneutic practice which he or she performs on the symptomatic actions of other people. Somewhat similarly, in the Schreber case history Freud conceptualizes the alleged homoerotic basis of paranoia by means of a semantic decoding of the various possible contradictions of the sentence, “I love him”: each contradiction constitutes one mode of interpretation of worldly phenomena, and corresponds to one variety of paranoia (XH:62−65). But not only is the paranoiac an interpreter: He or she is one of an especially systematic and ambitious type. In the essay “On Narcissism,” Freud explicitly links paranoia with the formation of speculative systems (XIV:96), and in the reading of Schreber he notes a profound affinity between paranoia and megalomaniacal delusions of world catastrophe (XII.68−71). The paranoiac is not only someone for whom every detail is meaningful—for whom nothing can be left uninterpreted or taken for granted—but someone who holds a conception of meaning that is both totalizing and hermeneutic. The paranoiac is the most rigorous of metaphysicians. The typical paranoid outlook is thoroughgoing, internally logical, never trivializing, and capable of explaining the multitude of observed phenomena as aspects of a symmetrical and expressive totality. No particular of empirical reality is so contingent or heterogeneous that the paranoiac cannot, by a straightforward process of point-for-point correspondence, interpret its meaning within the framework of his or her own grand system. The totalizing closure of paranoia is, in fact, noted as lucidly by Dick as by Freud: in “Shell Game” (one of Dick’s finest stories and the germ of <emphasis>Clans of the Alphane Moon</emphasis> [1964]), the massive frustration of attempting to break down such closure is powerfully recorded, and the basic problem is clearly stated. “The paranoid is totally rigid,” says one of the characters. “He logically weaves all events, all persons, all chance remarks and happenings, into his system” (3:195).</p>
   <p>Freud is similarly baffled. One can detect an unusual tone of weary exasperation when he reports his experience in treating jealousy (always closely related to paranoia and, beyond a certain point of delusionality, one of its varieties): “One must refrain from disputing with [the jealous patient] the material on which he bases his suspicions; one can only aim at bringing him to regard the matter in a different light” (XVIII:224−25). On the other hand, though Freud never considers paranoia as other than a sickness, it is a sickness for which he seems to have an unaccustomed intellectual respect. Not only does he associate paranoia with philosophy; he suggests that there may be “more truth in Schreber’s delusion than other people are as yet prepared to believe” (XII:79), and as early as <emphasis>The Psychopathology of Everyday Life</emphasis> he concedes a “partial justification” (VI:255) to paranoiac interpretations. Or, as the paranoiac Horselover Fat says of himself in Dick’s <emphasis>VALIS,</emphasis> “What he did not know then is that it is sometimes an appropriate response to reality to go insane” (§1.2).</p>
   <p>Jacques Lacan, however, goes one step further. What Freud regards as an especially interesting disease Lacan situates as crucial to the “normal” human psyche. The rationalizing interpretations of paranoia, elaborated into a system at the center of which stands the “I” of the paranoiac, are for Lacan paradigmatic of human psychic development as inaugurated by the “mirror stage” of objectifying identification, when distinctions and links are first established between an alienated “I” and an alienating not-“I.” It is in this way that, in such early essays as “ Aggressivity in Psychoanalysis” and “The Freudian Thing,” Lacan maintains that the ego is structured on a paranoiac basis and that human knowledge operates according to a paranoiac principle.<a l:href="#n_3" type="note">[3]</a> But the largest significance of these well-known formulations becomes evident only in the context of Lacan’s later attempt, in <emphasis>The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis,</emphasis> to provide a materialist historicization of the major psychoanalytic categories. He argues that the subject known to Freudian analysis—which seems to itself to be centered and autonomous but which analytic theory and practice show to be divided or “decentered” between the Imaginary (or specular and dualistic) and Symbolic (or linguistic and structural) Orders—is by no means an eternal, ahistorical phenomenon. On the contrary, Lacan repeatedly links its emergence with such cultural products of the period of nascent bourgeois hegemony as perspectival optics and the Cartesian <emphasis>cogito:</emphasis> The Freudian subject and the subject of capitalism are inextricably related. Again, paranoia plays a crucial role in Lacan’s formulations. “At the basis of paranoia itself,” he says, “there reigns the phenomenon of the <emphasis>Unglauben,”</emphasis> which is in turn defined as “the absence of one of the terms of belief, of the term in which is designated the division of the subject” (Four 238). But the designation of the division of the subject is, of course, precisely what the bourgeois ego constitutively and necessarily forecloses; and, again, there is no basis for a sharp distinction between the paranoiac and the “normal” subject of capitalist society.</p>
   <p>It is in a Lacanian framework, then, that we can draw the most radical conclusions from Freud’s descriptions of paranoia, which Freud himself was prevented from drawing by his ahistoricism and by his decisive clinical dichotomy between disease and health. Paranoia, we can conclude, is no mere aberration but is stucturally crucial to the way that we, as ordinary subjects of bourgeois hegemony, represent ourselves to ourselves and embark on the Cartesian project of acquiring empiricist knowledge. In this sense, we can accept Freud’s urgency when he insists of certain paranoiac delusions that <emphasis>“there is in fact some truth in them”</emphasis> (VI:256).</p>
   <p>But what is it in the workings of capitalism that interpellates individuals as paranoid subjects? If, as we have seen, paranoia operates by a hermeneutic logic, what is it in bourgeois society that we are compelled to interpret? Capitalism is definable as generalized commodity production, which, as Marx shows, necessarily encompasses generalized commodity fetishism. But the secret of the commodity itself—the basic distinction between the commodity and the non-commodified object of traditional societies—is its dual aspect, its status as both a use-value that satisfies some human need and an exchange-value that renders it an interchangeable atom in the total system of exchange and that mystifies its origin in human labor. Furthermore, use-value, though indispensable to the commodity, is also, paradoxically, irrelevant to its status <emphasis>qua</emphasis> commodity: Capitalism constitutes the hegemony of exchange-value (or simply “value,” as Marx more often calls it). I suggest, then, that the commodity as bearer of value—both the basic economic “cell” of capitalism and a mystifying signifier—is the ultimate object of paranoid hermeneutic by the historical subjects of bourgeois society. If we are economically constituted as capitalists and workers who must buy and sell human labor that is commodified into labor-power, then we are psychically constituted as paranoid subjects who must seek to interpret the signification of the objects—commodities—which define us and which, in a quasi-living manner, mystify the way that they and we are defined. “Value,” says Marx,</p>
   <cite>
    <p>does not have its description branded on its forehead; it rather transforms every product of labour into a social hieroglyphic. Later on, men try to decipher the hieroglyphic, to get behind the secret of their own social product: for the characteristic which objects of utility have of being values is as much men’s social product as is their language.</p>
    <text-author>(<emphasis>Capital</emphasis> 1:167)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>From a Lacanian perspective, it is easy to see that there is nothing accidental in the collocation of language and value: Both are signifying orders which demand interpretation. In addition, it is, I think, also arguable that what is generally true of capitalism is particularly true of twentieth-century monopoly capitalism. “Consumerism”—that is, the increased importance of individual as distinct from productive consumption and the organized stimulation of the former by techniques such as advertising-saturates the social field with hieroglyphics to an extent unprecedented in all of human history.<a l:href="#n_4" type="note">[4]</a> Virtually no aspect of life is left untouched: If our sexual lives are as dependent on over-the-counter contraceptive devices as our political awareness is on televised representations of the “news,” yet all of these components of what has been called “the society of the spectacle”<a l:href="#n_5" type="note">[5]</a> are first and last mystifying bearers of exchange-value.</p>
   <p>When writing discursively, Dick may speak merely of “objects,” but in his novels the commodification of these objects is made evident. The androids manufactured by the Rosen Association are primarily for sale,<a l:href="#n_6" type="note">[6]</a> while in <emphasis>Ubik</emphasis> the ordinary accouteiments of Joe Chip’s middle-class life (his coffee pot, his door, his shower, his bathroom, his refrigerator, <emphasis>et alia</emphasis>) actually foreground their role as exchange-values by verbally (and not too politely) demanding money before each act of use. If, as has often been noted, Dick is a paranoid writer, this is true not only because, on the level of character representation, his protagonists tend to be fearful and harassed men who strive to interpret and deal with alienating forces beyond their control. Even more importantly, the logic of Dick’s paranoia is constituted by his representation of those forces themselves as commodities. In <emphasis>The Unteleported Man</emphasis> (1966), even a nightmare vision of German totalitarianism is based on a popular consumer-oriented business. In <emphasis>The Zap Gun</emphasis> (1967), even the world-wide arms race resolves into the production and marketing of consumer goods. Commodities for Dick are frequently “alive” in a more than metaphorical sense, for they are shown to participate in the paradigmatically “human” exchanges of linguistic and sexual intercourse. Like Joe Chip, one can argue with them, plead with them, scold them. Like Rick Deckard in <emphasis>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,</emphasis> one can even go to bed with them. It is, to put the matter mildly, unlikely that Philip Dick ever intended to represent the subjective or ideological state that a Marxist-Lacanian theory, which co-ordinates paranoia with commodity fetishism, would lead one to expect as paradigmatic for the bourgeois ego. But, objectively, this formulation seems to me a valid description of one major aspect of his work. Marx illustrates commodity fetishism through the metaphor of the acrobatic, thinking, dancing table. Lacan, in “The Freudian Thing,” illustrates the paranoiac structure of the ego through the metaphor of the speaking desk. Dick accepts this kind of metaphoric structure and novelistically literalizes it.</p>
   <p>But it is not only commodity fetishism which, as Dick’s texts also suggest, can be co-ordinated with paranoia. Second only to this economic category is a more specifically political category whose pressure is also felt in Dick’s paranoid texts: conspiracy. Conspiracy (in sharp contrast to commodity fetishism) is a woefully under-theorized term in the Marxist tradition, which has, indeed, tended to be extremely wary of it. Marxists have suspected, often justly, that to invoke conspiracy in political discourse is to replace structural analysis with merely ethical finger-pointing. Yet it can also be argued that in a monopoly-capitalist state like modern America-intensely centralized and militarized but still governed according to bourgeois—democratic forms—conspiracy is no voluntaristic aberration but a structural necessity for ruling-class politics.<a l:href="#n_7" type="note">[7]</a> When actual political power is largely concentrated in a relatively compact network of corporate, military, and governmental bureaucracies—and yet when it is unfeasible to exercise this power in despotic ways that too openly flout popular sentiment or legislative and judicial sanctions—then the ruling elite may have only two choices. It can curtail the enforcement of its perceived interests out of prudence or (ethical) respect for republican parliamentarianism; or it can adopt conspiratorial methods. There is, I think, substantial evidence that the latter course has frequently been taken, from the still murky affairs at Dealey Plaza and the Watergate, to the open expressions of contempt for and evasion of democratic sanctions that Noam Chomsky and others have repeatedly documented in publications of elite groups like the Trilateral Commission.<a l:href="#n_8" type="note">[8]</a></p>
   <p>But a fully rigorous Marxist theorization of conspiracy has yet to be undertaken. Though I can hardly develop such a theory here, I will suggest that it is at least provisionally plausible to regard conspiracy as crucial to a theoretical description of the political level of society under certain varieties of monopoly capitalism.</p>
   <p>Such a theory would, in any case, tend to explain the representations of conspiracy in Dick’s fiction, where conspiracy is often as powerful as commodity fetishism and where the hermeneutic of paranoia works to decipher signs of conspiracy as well as exchange-values. In <emphasis>Dr. Bloodmoney</emphasis> (1965), the ultimate conspiracy of nuclear war (one of Dick’s recurring obsessions) is metaphorically located in the brain of one right-wing military scientist, but usually Dick’s treatment is more literal. In <emphasis>Time Out of Joint</emphasis> (1959), for example, Ragle Gumm’s paranoid delusion of being the object of an immense governmental conspiracy and the most consequential person in the world turns out to be the precise, unproblematic truth. Similarly, in <emphasis>A Scanner Darkly</emphasis> (1977), Robert Arctor is finally destroyed by the conspiratorial collusion between the state authorities which employ him and the criminal drug syndicate which he is employed to fight In <emphasis>Ubik,</emphasis> the plot structure itself is based on the interpretative attempts of Joe Chip and colleagues to discover the nature and perpetrator of the horrifying conspiracy that has enveloped them-questions which, after several apparent answers, the novel finally leaves in permanent suspense. If Dick’s protagonists tend to be paranoid, there is always much for them to be paranoid about. For they live in a world dominated by commodities and conspiracies; which is to say, a world not wholly unlike our own. I will discuss later whether paranoia can finally be considered “true.” But it is normally the truth for Philip Dick.</p>
   <p>And not only for him. There is. I suggest, a privileged relationship between paranoiac ideology and the genre of SF in general. For SF, far more than mundane fiction, requires what seems to be the fictional creation of a new world, one whose assumptions are radically at variance with those of everyday life. Yet (unless we are willing to invoke a theological concept of poetic inspiration or imagination) <emphasis>creation</emphasis> in this context can only mean an ideological interpretation of the actual world. The radical novelty of SF interpretations—which helps produce what Darko Suvin has termed the “cognitive estrangement”<a l:href="#n_9" type="note">[9]</a> of the genre-tends to require a rather thorough and totalizing presentation; for little can be taken for granted or left to the reader’s common sense. It is in this way that Dr. Schreber, with his estranging, self-consistent, paranoid world-vision, is himself very nearly an SF author. Furthermore, the great majority of SF inherits certain basic formal properties from the realist, as distinct from the modernist or postmodernist, novel: The typical SF text has a smoothly diachronic narrative line and offers its characters as mimetic representations of human beings.<a l:href="#n_10" type="note">[10]</a> Such formal tendencies work to reinforce the pressure toward logical coherence and expressive totalization. In both estranging “content” and realist “form,” then, SF closely corresponds to the weird and coherent interpretive systems of the paranoiac.</p>
   <p>One could, I think, write a history of the genre in these terms-from the pioneering efforts of H. G. Wells (the negative Utopias of <emphasis>The Time Machine</emphasis> [1895] and <emphasis>When the Sleeper Wakes</emphasis> [1899], the nightmare representation of extraterrestrial imperialism in <emphasis>The War of the Worlds</emphasis> [1898]), to such more recent and sophisticated efforts as Ursula Le Guin’s <emphasis>The Dispossessed</emphasis> (1974), where the luxury commodities of A-Io have an always ominous and finally sinister aura, or Samuel Delany’s <emphasis>Babel-17</emphasis> (1966), where language itself is reified into a conspiratorial weapon of war. If Philip Dick, however, is as some have claimed, the greatest of all SF authors—“the Shakespeare of science fiction,”<a l:href="#n_11" type="note">[11]</a> as Fredric Jameson has called him—then I suggest that his stature can be at least partly explained by his pre-eminence in the production of paranoiac ideology, his uniquely rigorous and consistent representations of human subjects caught in the web of commodities and conspiracies. These two paranoid themes are perhaps most fully worked out and combined in <emphasis>Ubik,</emphasis> which, however, may also imply a certain critique of paranoia itself.</p>
   <p>The world of <emphasis>Ubik</emphasis> is thoroughly saturated by commodities that foreground their status as quasi-living, mystifying signifiers. Not only do doors threaten to sue and coffee-pots demand money for services rendered; creditor robots dun free-spending debtors like Joe Chip, and animate homeopapes read the news for a specified fee. Telephones and TV sets occasionally adopt a will of their own and, much to Joe Chip’s confusion, transmit their messages in a way only very dubiously related to any human agency. One of the first clear indications in the plot that things have gone desperately wrong, that the characters may have been killed, is that money—the universal equivalent of all exchange-values—begins to alter its form. Later, the time-regression which the characters experience is charted primarily by the backward technological march of commodities, as when an ultra-modern TV set regresses into an old-fashioned radio. Furthermore, it is not only that commodities make their presence insistently felt, sometimes comically, sometimes nightmarishly, but always in an estranging manner which invites interpretation; the world of <emphasis>Ubik</emphasis> is also one in which virtually everything is in one way or another commodified. Pat Conley, perhaps the most frightening <emphasis>femme fatale</emphasis> in the Dick canon, becomes Joe Chip’s mistress by paying a straightforward cash sum, and appropriately wears the tattoo <emphasis>caveat emptor</emphasis> (which Joe is unable to decipher). Expensive moratoriums maintain the dead in a state of “half-life,” the commodity structure having produced the technology to deconstruct even the distinction between life and death. An important role in the capitalist economy of 1992 is played by Ray Hollis’s firm of hired “precogs” and telepaths, and also by the prudence organizations like Runciter Associates, which, on a strictly commercial basis, will provide “inertials” to neutralize unwanted eavesdropping and prognostication.</p>
   <p>It is not accidental that the most intimate and valued human relationship represented in the novel is that between Joe Chip and Glen Runciter: that is, between employee and employer (as both are frequently noting), between seller and buyer of the commodity called labor-power. Finally, the entire text is semantically dominated by Ubik itself, the ultimate and universal commodity and the symbol of the ubiquity of the commodity structure. Introduced in the small commercials that serve as epigraphs to each chapter (where it is in turn presented as a make of car, a brand of beer, a brand of instant coffee, <emphasis>et alia</emphasis>), Ubik finally enters the narrative itself as a mysterious spray in an aerosol can that seems to be the most powerful “reality support” available, the only force capable of at least temporarily reversing the processes of regression and death. In the end, this strange but paradigmatic commodity is identified with theological mystery: “I am Ubik. Before the universe was, I am. . . . I am. I shall always be” (§17.207).</p>
   <p>From every direction, then, the characters of <emphasis>Ubik,</emphasis> who become increasingly paranoid as the narrative progresses, are dominated by—indeed constituted by—the commodity structure. But their paranoia is also, and even more directly, determined by the terrifying conspiracy or conspiracies that trap them. That they and their (commodified) surroundings should be made to regress, to go backward in time and be drained of vital energy, is itself a conspiracy worthy of Kafka or Pynchon. But even more powerful is the extreme importance and difficulty of deciphering the conspiracy. First, it seems to be the effect of the bomb blast arranged by Ray Hollis; later, it appears that possibly it may be a weird practical joke by Glen Runciter; for some time, Joe Chip and his friends are convinced that the psionic powers of Pat Conley are responsible; finally, the childish half-lifer Jory is found to be the perpetrator. Yet even this hard-won knowledge is problematized in the novel’s last lines, where Glen Runciter (whom we had assumed <emphasis>not</emphasis> to be conspiratorially trapped) is left holding a Joe Chip coin, as Joe and the other characters had earlier found Runciter’s face on their money. “This was just the beginning,” the novel concludes (§17.208), and the definitive explanation of the conspiracy is indefinitely postponed.</p>
   <p>Likewise, of course, the mystical veil finally thrown over Ubik precludes any final explanation of the commodity structure. This indeterminacy, this textually explicit failure of closure, is rare in Dick’s fiction and can, I think, be read as hinting at the conceptual limits of paranoia itself. For this Assuring of the text, this refusal to provide any unproblematic narrative resolution, constitutes precisely the kind of epistemological disjunction that paranoia cannot allow. The novel may thus suggest that paranoia—and no Dick character is more paranoid and more justly paranoid than Joe Chip—is in the last instance not an adequate response to the structures of commodification and conspiracy, however inevitably and “naturally” it is produced by them.</p>
   <p>In this case, then, <emphasis>Ubik</emphasis> marks in the Dick canon a theoretical high point in relation to the Marxist-Lacanian problematic which I outlined earlier. For paranoia, with its easy hermeneutic passages from appearance to essence and its assumption of a totality that is symmetrical and expressive rather than structural and de-centered, is an ideology in the strictest Althusserian sense: a ‘“representation’ of the Imaginary relationship of individuals to their Real conditions of existence.”<a l:href="#n_12" type="note">[12]</a> Like any ideology, paranoia is finally based on a refusal of any complex theoretical structure of differentials, remaining instead within the specular or dualistic reductionism proper to the Imaginary. Only thus can its unswervingly hermeneutic logic operate. It can no more be identified with theoretical knowledge than commodity fetishism can be identified with Marx’s discovery of the basis of generalized commodity production, or the paranoiac structure of the ego with Lacan’s concept of the de-centering of the subject.</p>
   <p>Yet paranoia remains, I think, of all ideologies perhaps the most “reasonable” and the most nearly approximating to knowledge of capitalist society. If, as <emphasis>Ubik</emphasis> suggests, the hermeneutic of paranoia is finally doomed to failure, yet our social and psychic constitution as bourgeois subjects makes the temptation to such hermeneutic irresistible. If paranoia is an ideology, it nonetheless remains a stubbornly privileged one. And no modern writer-certainly none since Kafka—has fictionally produced that ideology more rigorously than Philip K. Dick.</p>

   <p>“Impostor” has long been recognized as among Philip K. Dick’s most important stories. One of his earlier efforts, it establishes several of Dick’s paradigmatic gestures and traces a problem increasingly important to poststructural thought: that of the double and its emblematic representation of alterity. Dick acknowledged its pivotal position within the development of his work in his 1976 “Afterthoughts by the Author,” interpretative notes appended to the <emphasis>Best of Philip K. Dick</emphasis> (1977) collection: “Here was my first story on the topic of: am I human? Or am I just programmed to believe I am human? When you consider that I wrote this back in 1953, it was, if I may say so, a pretty damn good new idea in SF” (rpt. <emphasis>The Collected Stories</emphasis> 2:381). In SF, maybe. But in mainstream literature, the double has been a recurring motif for at least the last 200 years. Mary Shelley’s manufactured monster, you’ll recall, is “more human” than the demigod Victor Frankenstein. Arthur Rimbaud, Franz Kafka, Samuel Beckett, and many others have pursued the notion in startlingly various ways. Other SF writers have explored similar thematic territory (Theodore Sturgeon’s “The Clinic,” 1953, or Frederic Pohl’s “The Tunnel Under the World,” 1955, remain stunning examples), though none has done so with the power, precision, or consistency of Dick.<a l:href="#n_13" type="note">[13]</a></p>
   <p>As Maurice Merleau-Ponty, the influential French philosopher and critical theorist, wrote in an essay entitled “Metaphysics and the Novel,” “the work of a great novelist always rests on two or three philosophical ideas . . . . The function of the novelist is not to state these ideas . . . but to make them exist for us the way things exist” (<emphasis>Sense and Non-Sense</emphasis> 26). This is surely the case for Dick. Critical accounts typically catalog Dick’s ideas: the current state of humanity’s self-alienation; our cultural and personal paranoia; the failure of humans to empathize; the ontological despair of living within an industrial and politicized culture that manufactures “reality”; and so forth. These large, fuzzy ideas are informed by complications that subordinate Dick’s “two or three” ideas to one: the problematics of (postmodern) reflection. Employing an array of rhetorical devices, Dick’s thematics develop a specific cluster of tropes-inversion, reversibility, parallelism, ironic reinscription, false dichotomies, paralogy<a l:href="#n_14" type="note">[14]</a>—all of which are conventionally grouped under the rubric of “the double.” Almost every use of these conventions or tropes isolates a specific problem within the general question of (self-)reflection, the problem of otherness, or <emphasis>alterity.</emphasis> Dick’s particular obsession with the ambiguities of alterity combines a concern over what constitutes human subjectivity with what defines human (and humane) behavior.</p>
   <p>The central importance of Dick’s early work remains an unexplored territory, primarily because critical accounts of Dick’s development usually summarily dismiss the 1950s stories, glossing them as juvenilia, mere studies for the longer and more convoluted novels. Kim Stanley Robinson, in <emphasis>The Novels of Philip K. Dick,</emphasis> says the relation of the early to late fiction resembles that between “pencil studies [and] oil paintings” (xi). Patricia Warrick holds that “his early short stories are straightforward metaphors, simple mirrors, presenting to us the bizarre possibilities his imagination sees. His later metaphors move into realms of increasing complexity and his mirroring device becomes a doubly ironic metaphor composed of opposites facing each other” (213). Warrick argues that the stories function as simple allegories and the later work as complex accounts, configuring the former as realistic mimetic representations and the latter as problematic ontological reveries. The image she selects to describe Dick’s complexity-mirrors facing each other-unconsciously invokes the poststructural paradigm of reflexivity: the abyss of specular recursion, the <emphasis>mise en abyme.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Indeed, poststructural vocabularies provide the proper means for reading Dick, and I will argue that “Impostor” contains not just the later Dick inchoate; virtually all the themes and tropes of the later work are mapped within the story—as Merleau-Ponty says, made to exist the way things exist.</p>
   <p>In his <emphasis>Exegesis,</emphasis> the massive journal kept to record the systematic explication of his hermeneutics and cosmology,<a l:href="#n_15" type="note">[15]</a> Dick emphasized the importance of “Impostor” to the “Great Narrative” (167) of his <emphasis>oeuvre,</emphasis> summarizing its motif as “studying false inner identity lost memories of the true self! The 2 identities war with each other, with an in-breaking of messages . . . [which] as the messages in UBIK, just break in ‘from the mysterious outside”’ (165−66). Just as these two identities turn out to be functions of a single problematic, so too the early and late Dick differ only in matters of degree or style, not theme or philosophical sophistication. However overdetermined the coding of a short story may be, “Impostor” does have limits, and its length restricts the text to a single cluster of themes. Dick thought “Impostor” explicitly addressed a concern his latter work presupposed-only “Impostor” isolates a commentary on “our identity” (<emphasis>Exegesis</emphasis> 186). And just as a character in <emphasis>VALIS</emphasis> appears shaken when he realizes “this wasn’t orthodoxy” (174), so “Impostor” treats personal identity as a phenomenon of heterology.<a l:href="#n_16" type="note">[16]</a> <emphasis>Heterodox</emphasis> is more than just a kind term for someone who defines the first-person pronoun as “disinhibiting stimulus restoring blocked memory” (<emphasis>Exegesis</emphasis> 180).</p>
   <subtitle>THE PARANOIA OF “IMPOSTOR”</subtitle>
   <p>The plot of “Impostor” (2:299−310) seems relatively simple, sufficiently linear for pulp product, and adequately stable for acritical consumption. Spence Olham—for ten years a researcher in “The Project” (299), a massive R&amp;D effort to develop “a weapon for positive combat” (300) in humanity’s war against the “Outspacers”—falls under suspicion as a double agent. “Impostor” follows twenty-four hours in Olham’s life, opening <emphasis>in media res,</emphasis> amid the dirty dishes of a 7 a.m. breakfast with his wife Mary. Speculating on the possibility of personal peace, to be found only through a vacation in the bucolic woods, Spence reflects on the source of his exhaustion (300)-his unrelenting labors to design a way to defeat the “needle-ships” from Alpha Centauri that swept past helpless Earth ships until the invention of the “protec-bubble,” a defensive force field sealing off Earth from Outspacer weapons (299).</p>
   <p>When his old friend and long-time colleague Nelson arrives, purportedly to transport both to the Project, the single page of exposition immediately gives way to a narrative inversion-Spence’s arrest. Entering the “shoot” (a very fast, private air-car), Olham discovers that Nelson is accompanied by Peters, a major in “FAS, the security organ”; genuinely puzzled to hear Peters has come along “to see” him (300), Spence is astonished when Nelson thrusts a gun into his ribs and the “bug” vectors off into space (301). Peters explains that a needle-ship had penetrated the protec-bubble, murdered the original Spence Olham, leaving a “spy in the form of a humanoid robot” in his place (302); the robot was equipped with a “U-Bomb” (302) keyed to trigger with a particular, as yet unknown phrase (301, 303). The FAS plans to disarm the robot only in a safe location—the moon.</p>
   <p>Authentically bewildered, Spence insists he is himself, not a robot. He tries to assure his old friend that he is the same, the identical man Nelson had known since they had been college roommates twenty years earlier (303). His interior monolog confirms that he isn’t dissembling: He wracks his brain for ways to convince his captors that he is indeed who he says, repeatedly thinking that he needs to tell his wife, and then later fixing on the notion that a physician could resolve the false accusation with a careful medical examination. “I’m Olham,” he says. “I know I am. But I can’t prove it.” Peters counters that the perfect robot would be “unaware that he was not the real Spence Olham. He would become Olham in mind as well as body. He was given an artificial memory system, false recall” (303); the sole difference between authentic and bogus Spence would be the U-Bomb, which could be discovered only by the scientific team ready “to disassemble” him. Landing on the moon (304), his death by dismemberment is imminent, though asphyxiation or decompression might come first, for Peters does not offer him a space suit. Suddenly fixing on a ruse, Spence warns Nelson and Peters that his bomb will explode, and the two men evacuate the space car, scrambling for safety. Spence seals and repressurizes the cabin and then returns to Earth (305).</p>
   <p>Once back in his village, Spence phones his mystified wife, telling her to solicit the presence of Dr. Chamberlain on the pretense that she is very sick; Spence reasons that physical scrutiny by a respected scientist will “overcome their madness, their hysteria with facts” (306). Under cover of evening’s darkness, he returns home by foot. Worried that like Nelson, Mary might also have been suborned by the maniacal conspiracy against him, he approaches his house cautiously, his dour suspicions confirmed by the terror shown in Mary’s face. Hotly pursued by security officers who burst from within his home, Olham flees toward “the outskirts of the wilderness between the inhabited places” (307) where he’d left the bug, only to discover Peters already there. “You are still under the illusion created by your artificial memories,” Peters declares, adding that Spence was surrounded and within six hours would be discovered and shot on sight. Spence feels the pressure: The “cordon of armed men” was “coming all the time, squeezing him into a smaller and smaller space” (307). Since his wife, his best friend, and his very home have betrayed him, he realizes that his only remaining hope is to find the needle-ship’s “remains” (308), to show Peters concrete proof of his innocence. The crashed ship, of course, would have to be in “some wild place, a remote spot where there were no people” (308).</p>
   <p>“Sutton Wood,” where only yesterday morning he had dreamed of vacationing (301), is such a place. Indeed, Olham finds the ruined ship there and convinces the arriving Peters that the wreck merits investigation. Yet “suddenly doubt assailed him. Suppose the robot had lived long enough to wander away? Suppose his body had been completely destroyed, burned to ashes by the fire?” (309). At the crash site, they do discover a crumpled body, and “its mouth was open; the eyes stared glassily”-grotesquely twisted, says Peters, “like a machine that’s run down” (309). Converted to Spence’s innocence by the glint of metal from the chest of the “corpse” (310), Peters grimly expresses his apologies and suggests that Olham deserves a vacation. But Nelson then extracts the metal from the body—it is “an Outspacer’s needle-knife,” the proof necessary to convince not Peters but Spence of his imposture (310):</p>

    <p>He gaped.</p>
    <p>“But if that’s Olham, then<a l:href="#n_17" type="note">[17]</a> I must be—”</p>
    <p>He did not complete the sentence, only the first phrase. The blast was visible all the way to Alpha Centauri.</p>
   </cite>
   <p>The trigger, therefore, is not a key phrase but a self-realization that Spence is not Spence but not-Spence, the alien substitute, which detonates the U-Bomb, a weapon which must destroy the entire planet if we are to believe that its flash would.be visible 4.3 light-years away.</p>
   <p>In most respects, “Impostor” is a very conventional tale. Yet as even this brief recitation suggests, certain story elements subtly introduce complications unusual for pulp fiction, the sorts of ontological complications that indeed make Dick one of the most important writers of his generation. Politically, the story allegorizes cold war paranoia, a concern common to much 1950s SF; while captive heading toward the moon, Spence thinks to himself, “Perhaps at some other time, when there was no war, men might not act this way, hurrying an individual to his death because they were afraid. Everyone was frightened, everyone was willing to sacrifice the individual because of group fear” (304). While unquestionably an important aspect of the story, especially considering its 1953 publication, this allegory is as transparent as the literal narrative and requires little commentary.</p>
   <p>Since cold war paranoia frequently configured the red menace as infection or subversive infiltration, even the story’s medium of transport—a “bug”—takes on ominous overtones. A revisionary reading could easily gloss “Impostor” as a parable of AIDS, for the imagery is of needles penetrating prophylactic bubbles, which—as is the case with retrovirus infections—progressively compromises the internal system’s ability to defend itself; the explosion would then be a hyperbolic reversal, the bang attracting more attention than the actual whimper of implosion, the human suffering that demands our action. If less obvious, this reading is also clear, straightforward.</p>
   <p>Nor is it profitable to devote time to reading the story as a biogram, as the allegory of an author’s fantasies of conspiracy, the paranoia, agoraphobia, claustrophobia, or cultural vertigo that gave rise to such fantasies.<a l:href="#n_18" type="note">[18]</a> (Dick was obsessed by the spectre of his twin sister Jane, who died shortly following their premature birth.) While addressed to texts other than “Impostor,” this political and psychological ground has already been covered. In his discussion of “the representation of conspiracy in Dick’s fiction” (19), Carl Freedman has shown that such cultural paranoia implies a hermeneutics; biographical parallels have been ably documented by Gregg Rickman (see 27Iff.); Christopher Palmer has examined the way Dick fits within a postmodern continuum (“Postmodernism”); Dick himself is the best exponent of the notion of cultural vertigo (see Dick’s letter to Patricia Warrick qtd. 200).</p>
   <p>The story’s treatment of subjectivity, however, is far more opaque and merits careful scrutiny. As Spence is “squeezed into a smaller and smaller space” (307), the story becomes an allegory of the impossibly small space of subjectivity. It is a tale about Terrans and Outspacers, inside and outside, interior ipseity and exterior alterity. Similarly, this tale of doubles presents us with two separate problematics.</p>
   <subtitle>DOUBLES TROUBLE</subtitle>
   <p>The first of the story’s two fundamental complications is its relation to the ancient, diverse, and enormously rich literary convention of the double. “Impostor” hinges on “2 identities [at] war with each other,” where one is a copy or false representation of the other. The catalog of <emphasis>topoi</emphasis> associated with the double includes twins, phantoms, clones, <emphasis>Doppelgängers,</emphasis> ghosts, alter egos, double agents, androids, and simulacra; its signature modalities include duplicity, duality, simulation, dissimulation, verisimilitude, parallelism, and metonymic substitution. In both figure and modality, the double disjoins or disrupts some sense of “normality”; its plays upon double codings serve to introduce what Freud called <emphasis>unheimleichkeit—</emphasis>the uncanny, oxymoronic subversion of the familiar by the alien and, in turn, of the alien by the familiar.</p>
   <p>Careful reading of literary history reveals an extraordinary diversity for what might initially seem a pellucid allegorical trope. For instance, the ancient conception of duality within nature, as manifest in Gnostic and Manichaean doctrine, is neither “mythic” nor “ancient”; it produces the orthodox readings of much modern literature, as can be seen in most analyses of Melville’s Ahab. The double might be concealed, as is the case in “Impostor,” only for readers who fail to recognize the import of the title; the double might play a game of duplicity, masquerading in a way similar to the cross dressing of Shakespearean comedy; or the double might be known only to the audience, such as in the dramatic irony of Oedipus’ vigorous exclamations that he will stop at nothing in order to reveal Laius’ murderer, and so on. The logic of imposture serves philosophy as well. Plato’s metaphysics were based on the duplicitious relation of the <emphasis>eidos</emphasis> (or transcendental form) to the <emphasis>eidolon</emphasis> (its exteriorized, corporeal representation).</p>
   <p>Particularly (but not exclusively) in modem and postmodern literature, the double also invokes thematic or structural coupling and uncoupling. There are double plots, double narratives, and double convolutions; the narrative structure of many mystery novels or films folds in on itself to shock the audience-from the double suicide in the film <emphasis>Dead Ringers</emphasis> (no surprise) to the incest of <emphasis>Chinatown</emphasis> (big surprise). Poe’s “William Wilson” is a remarkable instance of this same narrative structure: A young man meets his mirror image, an alter ego who turns out to be himself. In “The Fall of the House of Usher,” the twins reappear in a coat of arms that, in creating an explicit <emphasis>mise en abyme,</emphasis> eventually implodes the house and the dynasty it symbolizes.</p>
   <p>But structural doublings can be far more subversive than doublings of character or plot, such as Italo Calvino’s play with narrative combinatorics in either <emphasis>The Cloven Viscount </emphasis>or<emphasis> If on a winter’s night a traveler.</emphasis> Occasionally, doublings subvert even the mimetic paradigm that has, since Aristotle, structured our orthodox conception of literature itself. The early modernist Baudelaire’s infamous indictment of the complicitous reader as his brother, his doublc—<emphasis>“hypocrite lecteur!-mon semblable,-mon frère!”</emphasis>—remains almost as shocking as Rimbaud’s postmodern claim that <emphasis>“Je est un autre”</emphasis>—a notion that, perhaps anticipating Nietzsche, regards even the self as a rhetorical construct, something modeled on syntactic possibility rather than ontic viability.</p>
   <p>Scholarly attempts to create a clear and distinct taxonomy of this history have been fascinating failures. Robert Rogers, Otto Rank, and Karl Miller have carefully and cogently traced its history (or rather histories, for how one treats the term, as anthropologist, philologist, psychologist, or literary historian renders very different results). Freud’s “The Uncanny” and <emphasis>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</emphasis> trace doubling to the repetition compulsion—the death drive.<a l:href="#n_19" type="note">[19]</a> René Girard’s influential <emphasis>Violence and the Sacred</emphasis> uses the narrative conventions of doubling to try to understand the codings of cultural anthropology; he observes that in any of its cultural forms, mimesis is already a form of doubling. “Man and His Doubles,” the penultimate section of Foucault’s <emphasis>The Order of Things,</emphasis> argues that signification itself doubles, but in so doing bifurcates, producing not doubling but difference, alterity (326−27; 338−41). Gilles Deleuze, in his book on Foucault, comments that “the inside will always be the doubling <emphasis>of</emphasis> the outside” (99), for in the phenomenon of doubling, inside/outside dialectics repeatedly fold back on themselves, creating logical loops that resemble mathematical models such as the Möbius strip.</p>
   <p>Theorists associated with linguistics, semiotics, and narratology have similarly offered engaging but finally limited insights. According to Bakhtin, Dostoevsky’s doubles manifest or embody contradictions of the hero’s existence, expressing what Bakhtin called the “dialogic quality” of subjectivity—that subjects (like history or cultures) cannot be totalized or foreclosed by any definition. Following A. J. Greimas’s discussion (in <emphasis>Structural Semantics</emphasis>) of “double articulation” or “double isotropy”—the multivalences produced by either semantic or syntactic potentiality—in <emphasis>Semiotics and the Philosophy of Language</emphasis> Umberto Eco argues that any individual work of literature always opens a dialogue with other texts. With the same intent but a different vocabulary, in <emphasis>Revolution in Poetic Language</emphasis> Julia Kristeva named this semiotic resonance intertextuality, a very familiar term these days, but really only the product of an ancient motif.</p>
   <p>Taken together, all this scholarly and theoretical work serves to demonstrate that the relation between original and copy is fundamentally convoluted in a way that Jekyll/Hyde or chicken/egg dialectics only begin to approximate. Within this context, the project of poststructuralism has been to think through such problematics, what Jacques Derrida (modifying Mallarmé) has called the current “crisis of <emphasis>versus” </emphasis>(<emphasis>Dissemination</emphasis> 25; 233−44; 280−85). Dcrrida’s position is that we are in an age of relations, not resolutions, and the motif of doubling renders simulacra—“with the exception that there is no longer any model, and hence, no copy” producing for us a “reference without referent” (206). Certainly less rigorous but perhaps more accessible than Derrida, Jean Baudrillard has also tried to trace the oxymoronic consequences of simulation, arguing that we live in an age of original simulations, doubles of nothing:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>SF . . . has always played upon the <emphasis>double,</emphasis> on artificial replication or imaginary duplication, whereas [in Dick] the double has already disappeared. There is no more double; one is always already in the other world, an other world which is not another, without mirrors or projection or Utopias as means for reflection. The simulation is impossible, unsurpassably <emphasis>checkmated,</emphasis> without exteriority.</p>
    <text-author>(312)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>What disappears in Dick is the conception that doubles are secondary copies, diluted substitutes, ghostly images without substance. But as Paul Ricoeur rightly holds, “what sedimentation has contracted, narrative can redeploy” (122).</p>
   <p>One obvious curiosity of Dick’s canon is its competing counterurges or doubleurges-one toward a thorough dismantling of human pretensions to certainty and the other occupied with totalizing transcendental absolutes. When Dick turns to theorizing such dialectics, he usually invokes one of two formulations: (1) dualisms-two worlds, two parallel domains (cf. <emphasis>Exegesis</emphasis> 176) divided between what Dick called the <emphasis>koinos kosmos</emphasis> (the public, common world) and the <emphasis>idios kosmos</emphasis> (the private, solipsistic world) (“Letter of Comment” 31); (2) dialectical interplay, his “two source cosmogony” of <emphasis>VALIS</emphasis> (91), what he eventually called “my 2 slit logic” <emphasis>(Exegesis</emphasis> 180).</p>
   <p>Most of Dick’s fiction inscribes the problematic of the double. In <emphasis>VALIS,</emphasis> for example, the narrative voice suffers the psychic splintering that creates a self-reflexive topology, articulates the agonistics between the alleged narrator (T) and the protagonist (Horselover Fat), whose name means, in Greek and German, “Philip Dick” (§10.168). Similarly, consider the Parsifal/Perceval twin: two names for the same character, they signify differences even as they denote the same being (§8.124−25,130).<a l:href="#n_20" type="note">[20]</a> The reader’s constant and continual awareness of this uncanny narrator/character intimacy creates all of the novel’s tension and most of its theme.</p>
   <p>Copies and doubles fill Dick’s infrequently read 1964 novel <emphasis>The Simulacra,</emphasis> which features President Herr Rudi Kalbfleisch, also called “Der Alte” (§3.22), the Other. The novel is given to rather reductive accounts of confrontations with simulacra doubles as alter egos or <emphasis>Doppelgängers.</emphasis> Naturally, the image patterns and plot feature a series of reversals (§12.141), such as that articulated when one of the main characters (Richard Kongrosian) wails “I‘m <emphasis>turning inside out.’”</emphasis> (§14.175). Similar narrative patterns can be found in the novella “A. Lincoln, Simulacrum “—written in 1962 then published in <emphasis>Amazing</emphasis> (1969−1970) before it appeared slightly revised as <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> (1972—and the story “Explorers We” (4:147−55). In this latter tale, astronauts returning from Mars and who “just want to see people again” (147) land to declare “we’re back” (148). No greeting party awaits, and on wandering into the nearby town, the six men discover frightened inhabitants who flee in terror. The FBI arrives and executes the bewildered six, who we then discover are “mimicry” (154), Martian copies; Wilkes, a young, frightened “Bureau man,” wonders if the copies are human or not, but follows his instructions to their lethal conclusion, only to remember “it wasn’t over” (154). The final page of the story has the tale beginning again, with more simulacra arriving with the same desire and again declaring “we’re back” (155). “Explorers We,” which couples duplicity with recursion or iteration, inscribes doubling’s signature: estrangement, for both the human and the alien.</p>
   <p>Another extremely interesting example is the more familiar <emphasis>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</emphasis> (1968), where both humans and android doubles have become pawns in a system of industrial and domestic slavery. Rachael and Pris are copies of the same model (§6.59−60, §16.165, §19.195), although minor differences mark their asymmetry, a notion I will return to toward the end of this chapter. As clones-genetically precise doubles-they manifest Dick’s obsession with the self-delusion or false recall that marks many of his doubles, identifying a primary conceit of doubling-authentic doubles do not recognize themselves as double. The novel also features mechanical animals (owls, snakes, horses) manufactured to substitute for real ones; the protagonist Rick Deckard will discard an electric sheep for a real goat but ends up with an electric toad. Even the humans have their ghostly twins: There are double police agencies (§10.98−112) and Phil Resch serves as Deckard’s mirror image (§17.174), especially to provoke his own doubts about his status (§12.119, 124) and personal identity (§16.165), for he becomes “alien” even to himself (§21.204). Luba Luft tells Deckard that his lack of empathy makes him an android: “Maybe there was a human who once looked like you, and somewhere along the line you killed him and took his place. And your superiors don’t know” (§9.89). And so Deckard’s circumstances precisely parallel all of the androids’, including Roy Baty’s (§19.197).</p>
   <p>Within the novel’s narrative world, the very status of any “reality,” of any particular thing (person, place, idea, or emotion), is always in question. It may be “ersatz” (§4.38), a forgery such as the humans’ emotions (which would mark them as human and demarcate their difference from the biologically identical androids [§5.45−48]), which are precipitated by the “Penfield mood organ” (§1.3). Everything has the aspect of reality but is really “a simulation” (§12.123); everything is covered by or immersed within the signs of cultural entropy—“kipple” (§6.57)—which leads humans toward the same “flattening of affect” (§4.33) that identifies androids. (Curiously, this same “flattening” will in <emphasis>VALIS</emphasis> identify the schizoid [§1.15].)<a l:href="#n_21" type="note">[21]</a> With one’s entire horizon forged, faked, duplicated, or simulated, all things seem emptied of meaning, as is shown in this description of the virtual-reality representation of a human being: “The echo of himself ascending: the echo of nothing” (§2.17). Here, even the original being is an absence, already empty.</p>
   <subtitle>AUTHENTICITY AND EMPATHY</subtitle>
   <p>Doubling therefore produces the parallel question of authenticity, which in turn precipitates the question of adequate proof: Which double is real and how can I know? Spence says, “I‘m Olham. I know I am. But I can’t prove it.” In Dick’s story “I Hope I Shall Arrive Soon” (5:359−73), a couple wonders whether a famous poster in their possession is the original or a forgery. They have “a letter of authentication,” but “suppose the letter is a forgery? What we need is another letter certifying the first letter is authentic” (5:365). Perception may be an illusion, but doesn’t a text replicate the same uncertainty that a skeptic or a paranoid might find with perception? Sharing the joke, one character recalls the (probably apocryphal) anecdote of a dealer who brought a picture to Picasso “asking him if it was authentic, and Picasso immediately signed it and said, ‘Now it’s authentic’” (365). In this story, the problem of authenticity is resolved by a signature, by human action.</p>
   <p>In <emphasis>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,</emphasis> only Deckard acts on the ontological threat contained in problematizing perceptual or textual authority. Only Deckard experiences the acute anxiety Merleau-Ponty called the “perpetual uneasiness in the state of being conscious” (<emphasis>Sense</emphasis> 28) because he realizes the disconcerting truth that “the experience of the other is always that of a replica of myself <emphasis>(Prose</emphasis> 135). This serves to underscore the novel’s central thematic: Do humans authentically possess the empathy their manufactured doubles are said to lack? In popular SF, such questions receive formulaic, comforting treatment; any resultant anxiety serves only as dramatic tension to be released or resolved in the <emphasis>dénouement</emphasis> between final commercial break and production credits. For instance, whenever we ask if Data, the “Star Trek: The Next Generation” android, is really human, we are reassured to find our hopes confirmed. <emphasis>Do Androids Dream</emphasis> aggressively reverses the convention: Is Deckard really human? Dick’s disconcertingly catholic answer curiously recalls Sartre’s existentialist ethics-we are defined not by species or by chemical constitution but by actions, and the act in question is our ability to empathize with the Other by recognizing the originality of the replicas of myself. The novel’s easy thematic of doubled characters gives way to doubled values and doubly inflected action—and the boundary separating the humans and the androids becomes increasingly blurred, uncertain.</p>
   <p>Dick’s universe is peopled by humans whose humanity is progressively compromised-some because of their actions, others because of their circumstances, though both situations lead toward epiphanies (what in <emphasis>VALIS</emphasis></p>
   <p>Dick called theophanies [§5.75]) either for the characters or for the readers, resulting in the classical structure of <emphasis>dianoia</emphasis>—a new thought or insight deriving from the experience. Occasionally, the characters are compromised biologically (“Rautavaara’s Case” 5:375−83) or cybernetically (Palmer Eldritch). For instance, Deckard may wake the next morning and return to his sorry labors, but readers realize his tragedy.<a l:href="#n_22" type="note">[22]</a> All such effects serve the same double cast. First, they ironize an explicit boundary between human and machine (not merely invoke the man-as-machine metaphor, common since the Presocratics) by strategic reversals of plot and theme; this is conventionally called boundary ambiguity. Second, they ironize an implicit boundary between <emphasis>Homo sapien</emphasis> and humanity: Is humanity determined by certain DNA sequences or certain beliefs/behaviors?</p>
   <p>For Dick, “humanity” is a quality defined by neither biology nor history. His stories “Progeny,” “The Father Thing,” and “The Electric Ant” demonstrate this claim. Whether alien, robot, or <emphasis>Homo sapien,</emphasis> only empathy makes one human: “empathy, evidently, existed only within the human community” <emphasis>(Do Androids Dream</emphasis> §3.26). As Isidore says in <emphasis>Do Androids Dream,</emphasis> the battle is not over biology but “our psychic souls” (§7.67). “Human Is” (2:257−67) provides the paradigm for all of Dick’s explorations of this definition: A woman’s husband is kidnapped by aliens who then send a double to take his place. Discovering the counterfeit, she refuses to agree with “authorities” who claim aliens are “parasitic and destructive entities. Terran ethics don’t extend to them” (265) because she discovers that the alien is far more kind, caring, and considerate-more ethical in its relations with others-than the authorities are or her husband <emphasis>had been</emphasis> (267). Insofar as it has a moral, the moral of <emphasis>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</emphasis> is similar; human beings are members of a community, not separate selves at war with one another. “I do not ask how the wounded person feels, I myself become the wounded person” (56) Whitman wrote, articulating the dialectical ambiguities connecting an ethic of empathy with an ontology of the subject. (A detailed examination of the remarkable ethic shared by Dick and Whitman must remain the topic for another work.)</p>
   <p>Hence the double significance of the reversal of identity in “Impostor”—only Spence seems to think of community and family, only Spence calls for an end to hostilities, only Spence confronts what he <emphasis>really</emphasis> is. The irony is that such authenticity disrupts the prophylactic measures we use to isolate ourselves from others. At the heart of these ontological echoes, doubles, <emphasis>Doppelgängers,</emphasis> illusions, reversals, and counterfeits is the philosophical conundrum of personal identity, which is the second of the fundamental complications within “Imposter.”</p>
   <subtitle>CRISIS OF VERSUS</subtitle>
   <p>In our current thought, still so dependent on Enlightenment and Romantic models, the self remains “the place of all obscurities, the mystery of all mysteries, and something like an ultimate truth” (Merleau-Ponty, <emphasis>Signs</emphasis> 198). Still, as Robert Nozick points out, philosophical views of subjectivity are themselves troubled: “So many puzzling examples have been put forth in recent discussions of personal identity that it is difficult to formulate, much less defend, any consistent view of identity and non-identity” (29). Currently, “ipseity” and “alterity” are the fashionable philosophic terms for self-identity and the question of otherness, respectively. Summarizing the thrust both of his own argument and the general trend of twentieth-century thought on this dialectic, Paul Ricoeur writes that “the selfhood of oneself implies otherness to such an intimate degree that one cannot be thought of without the other, that instead one passes into the other” (3). Such paradoxes need unpacking.</p>
   <p>Generally, modern (analytic) philosophers divide the problem of personal identity into four distinct but intertwined problems: uniqueness, endurance, unity, and the noumenal essence.<a l:href="#n_23" type="note">[23]</a> Uniqueness concerns our ability to see any distinction between the I that is me and the other I that is you; endurance questions how a (unique) self can be said to be the same self over the passage of time; unity inquires into the problem of the composition of the self-how perceptions, memories, thoughts, fantasies, experiences, bodies, and so on all somehow meld into a single essence, self; and the noumenal description (sometimes thought of as the “one true” self) investigates the possibility that beyond all social and psychological roles and descriptions of the phenomenonal self there exists a noumenal entity whose substance and content is available only to the individual and not to others.</p>
   <p>Few people are analytic philosophers (thankfully), but most conceptions of subjectivity collapse the four problems into one view, usually invoking one or another notion of “common sense.” Common sense is, of course, simply an eclectic agglutination of those specific beliefs and methodologies we inherit from our culture, what the Greeks-always suspicious of “conventional wisdom” or “received belief-called <emphasis>doxa.</emphasis> (The French have a similar conception—<emphasis>parti pris.</emphasis>)<emphasis> Doxa</emphasis> constitutes the core, the central node of orthodox “straight thinking” that heterology would subvert. Our <emphasis>doxa</emphasis>-common-sense psychophysical dualism—asserts that, above all else, there exists one true self, one I, one singularly identifiable essence properly denominated by a single proper pronoun. This entity is usually named “the Cartesian subject” after the French philosopher who first gave an analytic articulation to the thing-that-thinks, the <emphasis>res cogito.</emphasis> This incorporeal “I,” the <emphasis>ego cogito</emphasis>, is always distinguished with respect to its opposite (the material body) and in this sense is similar to the other primary, primitive oppositions which inform the self s aboriginal world view: soul/body, mind/matter, inside/outside, essence/existence, substance/shape, reality/appearance, and so forth. (These fundamental oppositions mark the first step in the selfs self-alienating exile.) <emphasis>Ego cogito</emphasis> cannot be forgotten or misplaced, like manners or keys, nor broken and divided, like toes and friends—a distinction emphasized since Descartes, who discusses the contingencies of body and soul:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>For even if all [the selfs] accidents change-as, for example, if it conceives of certain things, wills others, and receives sense impressions of still others—it is nevertheless the same soul. But the human body becomes a different entity from the mere fact that the shape of some of its parts has been changed.</p>

   <p>The ephemera of personality, mere surface ornamentation, may be stripped away without damaging the whole, for the noumenal self must be indivisible and immutable even where it is corporeal. These intriguing exterior effects may “come to me days and nights and go from me again,/But” as Whitman wrote, “they are not the Me myself’ (26).</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, this common view of personal identity also domesticates notions of change and loss.</p>
   <cite>
    <p>Even that colloquialism “to lose one’s mind” implies that the <emphasis>whole</emphasis> thing is gone, not just a separable part of it. So too Freud’s idea of an unconscious, which posits separations between levels of consciousness, leaves the mind intact. Thus, insofar as a thought goes from a conscious to unconscious sphere, it is not lost, it is simply <emphasis>displaced.</emphasis> In fact, the notion that nothing can be lost from the mind is, in Freudian ideology, what causes trauma to the self.</p>

   <p>As the product of chemical, not ontological, imbalance, the (temporarily) insane man has only had his mind displaced to some dark corner, from which it may be possible to be retrieved. Or not so much dis-placed as dis-located, like a shoulder or an elbow.</p>
   <p>What poststructuralism has done generally, and Dick’s work specifically, is to put into question both the necessity and the desirability of such commonplace conceptions, such intellectual <emphasis>topoi,</emphasis> such ontologically secure categories. Richard Rorty has argued that the great question facing us now is the “whether we can give up what Stanley Cavell calls the ‘possibility that one among endless true descriptions of me tells who I am”’ (<emphasis>Consequences</emphasis> x1). Unlike the cozy conceptions of Descartes, Wordsworth, or even Freud, careful analysis of the phenomenon of subjectivity (begun by Hume) reveals a fractured, fissured bundle of effects and feelings, constantly in dynamic flux but continually static, the same self with us this morning at toast and tea. In Rorty’s more abstract phrase, the self is now conceived “as centerless, as random assemblages of contingent and idiosyncratic needs” (“Freud” 12). Much depends on this “knit of identity” (25) from which, as Whitman has it, “I weave the song of myself (37).</p>
   <p>How does poststructuralism weave the self from the catalog of its oxymoronic effects? Through rhetorical stitching, the weave of the text itself, the very fabric or textile of language. Merleau-Ponty and Emmanuel Lévinas’s conviction is that the self s relation to the other is structured, predicated, and sustained by language. Merleau-Ponty began, but because of his early death did not finish, a model of alterity that conceptualizes self/other relations within the matrix of linguistic mediation, itself the sort of labyrinth Deleuze would call a rhizome.<a l:href="#n_24" type="note">[24]</a> As Dick says in <emphasis>VALIS,</emphasis> “There is no route out of the maze. The maze shifts as you move through it” (§3.40).</p>
   <p>Language is that oxymoronic field wherein the private is expressed as the universal, the mystical made accessible, the solipsistic revealed:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>In speech we realize the impossible agreement between two rival totalities not because speech forces us back upon ourselves to discover some unique spirit in which we participate but because speech concerns us, catches us indirectly, seduces us, trails us along, transforms us into the other and him into us, abolishes the limit between mine and not-mine, and ends the alternative between what has sense for me and what is non-sense for me, between me as subject and the other as object.</p>
    <text-author>(<emphasis>Prose</emphasis> 145)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>Here is Merleau-Ponty’s description of the great problematic of subjectivity, and he argues that “our century has wiped out the dividing line between ‘body’ and ‘mind,’ and sees human life as through and through mental and corporeal, always based upon the body and always (even in its most carnal modes) interested in the relationships between persons” (<emphasis>Signs</emphasis> 226−27). His position is that the exclusive alternatives of binarism are simply false dichotomies with no basis in fact. Derrida has gone on to show that the brutal fact of language, through which and by which we understand (or not at all), is that it thoroughly scrambles the propriety of common-sense oppositions; self/other, inside/outside, original/copy-these are all cases of rhetorical doubling, not ontological fact.</p>
   <p>To illustrate the poststructural conception of personal identity as a useful model for reading Dick, I have might have selected Rorty, Derrida, Deleuze, or Lyotard. But like Dick, Merleau-Ponty is also known for his obsession(s) with carnality, for his deep and abiding concern with empirical physicality and its effects.<a l:href="#n_25" type="note">[25]</a> Indeed, Merleau-Ponty did not discuss the self but “the body-subject,” the way that the immaterial self is always already a material body. Like Dick, Merleau−Ponty respects the models generated by materialism but conceives of carnality as more than mere DNA sequences, neural pathways, or operant-conditioning patterns. Similarly, other common-sense binarisms are “wiped out,” placed under erasure. There exists not a self and a world, but a lived world, a life-world that integrates ipseity within alterity. And for Merleau-Ponty, such oxymoronic relations are first and foremost manifest in the fact of language: “To the extent that what I say has meaning, I am a different “other’ for myself when I am speaking; and to the extent that I understand, I no longer know who is speaking and who is listening” (<emphasis>Signs</emphasis> 97). These are the structures of intersubjectivity—a position that Merleau-Ponty would later conceptualize as the chiasmic trope of perceptual reversibility, as in his famous example of the instance where two hands touching can no longer distinguish the toucher from the touched (<emphasis>Visible</emphasis> 9, 263), so too any conception of inviolable boundaries between self/other and ipseity/alterity is placed under erasure by the chiasmic reversals precipitated by the double touch of that medium within which we <emphasis>live</emphasis> meaning: language.</p>
   <p>If Merleau-Ponty’s analysis is correct, then Lévinas is right to point out that “the comprehension of the other is thus a hermeneutics and an exegesis” (“The Trace of the Other” 351). In other words, one’s understanding of alterity always involves both a theory of meaning and an individual act of explication, a “reading-out-of,” which is literally what exegesis means. But the application of a general hermeneutics remains an eisegesis, a “reading-into,” another oxymoronic reciprocity manifest in the paradox of self and other.<a l:href="#n_26" type="note">[26]</a> The turbulence of these two turning terms forms what Derrida calls “the regulated play” (<emphasis>Of Grammatology</emphasis> 44) of alterity, of the difference he names <emphasis>“différance,”</emphasis> the general problematic of reading the double movement, double inscription, double imperative of the dialectic of intersubjectivity.</p>
   <p>The immediate problem for us is one Wallace Stevens struggled to describe in “Credences of Summer”—the “meaning of this capture, this hard prize,/Fully made, fully apparent, fully found” (376).</p>
   <subtitle>THE UNHEIMLICH MANEUVER</subtitle>
   <p>“Impostor” serves to erase thoroughly the sequatious certainty that any clear border demarcates self from other or original from double. Who is to say that “I” am not programmed by false memories? Even the <emphasis>ego cogito</emphasis> may turn out to be an electric ant. From the moment on the moon when Peters and Nelson flee, escaping from Spence’s threat that his U-Bomb will explode, “Impostor” is a study in uncanny maneuvers. This thematic is developed, first, by Dick’s ironic inversions, his “total reversal” <emphasis>(VALIS</emphasis> 160) of those qualities conventionally associated with being human. The robot Spence (hereafter Spence<sub>2</sub>) is more human than humans, the humans more robotic than the robot. “Impostor” opens with the android listlessly wondering about peace: “In the last month I’ve gotten weary of all this. Everything seems so grim and serious, no color to life” (300). It is Spence<sub>2</sub> who wants new life rather than destruction, who is emotionally affected by the “barren, lifeless ground” (300). The humans, on the other hand, behave programmatically, thoughtlessly, as represented by Nelson’s immediate and continual calls that “we should kill him now. We can’t wait” (301) or Mary’s betrayal of her husband without a shred of evidence, merely as the result of an anonymous authority’s order. The humans act through fear and paranoid fantasy (304), but Spence<sub>2</sub> confronts and then accepts the truth; he is the only character to do so.</p>
   <p>The story’s imagery similarly supports the reversal of qualities and the transgression of orthodoxies. Although we initially meet Spence<sub>2</sub>, we believe him to be Spence<sub>1</sub> despite repeated clues that he is an android. Finding the body of Spence<sub>1</sub>, Spence<sub>2</sub> conflates “the robot” with “his [own] body” (309). After landing on the moon, Peters doesn’t give Spence a space suit “because robots probably don’t require oxygen” (304); Spence then survives the bug’s decompression. Later, trying to escape through the woods, Spence runs “on and on” (306), like a machine. Indeed, when the story opens he declares that he’s “run down” (299), not tired. Of course, the strongest clues come just before the plot’s double reversal-where Peters converts to Spence<sub>2</sub>’s innocence coupled with Spence<sub>2</sub>’s almost immediate recognition of himself as the alien Other (both of these events happen within 100 words). On these last pages, Spence<sub>2</sub> repeatedly demonstrates otherwise inexplicable knowledge: He immediately recognizes his home compromised by fear (307) and later displays a remarkable understanding of Outspacer tactics, intuiting the needle-ship’s method of infiltration and present location (307−8).</p>
   <p>Yet the human Peters precisely replicates the robot’s uncanny certainty, suggesting that he too functions mechanically. How did he discover the perfect double? “We received a report” (302) Peters says, and the passive verb construction conceals the agent of action. How did he find the camouflaged bug? And how did he get to it before the fleeing Spence<sub>2</sub>? Such ironic reversals aren’t exceptions-they are the story’s rule. It is particularly the presence of the mysterious intelligence “report” that disrupts the apparent clarity of the narrative. At the level of plot, we can infer who authored this report—the Outspacers. Without a “report,” Peters would not have acted and Spence would not have been brought to the relevant recognition, for the explosion is entirely predicated on Spence’ s conception of self-identity. Then Peters also plays a role in the Outspacers’ game; unwittingly, he becomes their agent, a “security organ” (300) of their machine, fed a program he executes to perfection. Even Peters ironizes the question of agency.</p>
   <p>Of course, the twisted body Spence discovers in Sutton Wood (309) mirrors what Peters would have done to him had Spence not landed on a ruse to escape Peters while on the moon. The body of Spence<sub>1</sub> is initially recognized as Spence<sub>2</sub> because from the huge rent in the body’s chest “something glinted, something metal” (310), presumably the bomb within the alien’s chest. What should rest within the chest is the heart, that organ conventionally taken to signify humanity, for it is the seat of emotion, the site of empathy Dick defines as the human quality par excellence. Yet the metallic glint turns out to be the needle-knife, the very instrument permitting Spence<sub>2</sub> to become Spence<sub>1</sub>, and simultaneously the instrument allowing the final plot reversal—for Spence<sub>2</sub> to recognize himself (linking the <emphasis>peripeteia,</emphasis> the <emphasis>anagnorisis,</emphasis> and the moment of <emphasis>dianoia</emphasis> into a single paragraph). That the instrument of reversal is the needle-knife synecdochically parallels the larger threat of the Outspacers to humanity: as needle-knives end the lives of single beings, the needle-ships threaten the entire race.</p>
   <p>The trope structuring these repetitive reversals is metonymy, the figure of seamless contiguity; the alien invader replaces the human on the basis of similarity, not difference.<a l:href="#n_27" type="note">[27]</a> Without the “in-breaking” (<emphasis>Exegesis</emphasis> 165) of the otherwise inexplicable intelligence report, this metonymic substitution would have gone unnoticed, unremarked. Spence<sub>2</sub> will be Spence without subscript; it would make no sense even to say Spence<sub>2</sub> would have “replaced” Spence<sub>1</sub>, for not even Spence<sub>2</sub> would have known. And for readers who never “meet” Spence<sub>1</sub>, Spence<sub>2</sub> is “the original” undermined by the simulacrum Spence<sub>1</sub>. At the level of plot, this original must be concealed (not repressed) in order to effect the twist of the Hitchcockian convention: Innocent man falls into the shadows of invisible conspiracies; falsely accused, he finally returns from chaos into the ordered, real world when the true villain is fully unmasked. The plot’s ironic twist of this convention requires the original’s absence. On the ontological level, this absence is also necessary in order to establish the unresolvable dialectical play of absence and presence, of self and other that marks human subjectivity.</p>
   <p>Yet Spence<sub>1</sub> and Spence<sub>2</sub> remain irreducible to one another. Spence<sub>2</sub> is a double but asymmetrical (because of the U-Bomb).<a l:href="#n_28" type="note">[28]</a> Any double would need to be asymmetrical—in thought, in substance, in temporality—otherwise there would be no clear and distinct means to demarcate the one from the other. But if asymmetrical, then not double. Narcissus, bending over the pool, does not, cannot recognize himself. So what happens when we do recognize the self and its intimate echoes of the Other? Instability, rupture, irrupture, <emphasis>brisure</emphasis>—the stable self explodes. The paradox is that irreducibility and interpenetration aren’t contradictory. They are irreducible, but reciprocally constituted, just like the reader and the author, just like Horselover Fat and Philip K. Dick.</p>
   <p>What is placed under erasure<a l:href="#n_29" type="note">[29]</a> is an image of self remaining symmetrical with itself-an image (as double or simulacrum), a model of self-separate, self-determined subjectivity responsible only to itself. This model is destroyed, exploded, erased by its traumatic encounter with the consequences of alterity: The self is already an other, always already predicated by its encounter with the other and structured in/through an ethical relation of responsibility for the other.</p>
   <p>Olham passes through a crisis of subjectivity, a <emphasis>crisis of versus,</emphasis> affecting the complete shift of his subject position. He comes to recognize himself as the simulacrum—to know himself as the Other. It is an explosive moment, the “epiphany of the other,” to follow Lévinas’s phrase (“Trace” 351): The uncanny moment when Spence realizes he is not-Spence, self really not-self, inside actually outside, human actually alien, inner(space) really outer(space). At this moment “I” becomes “you,” a reversal of the two prefigured by the lateral symmetry of the glyphs “I” and “U” and the homophones “U” and “You.” The “U-Bomb” is obviously a You-Bomb. Death cannot be singular. Bang.</p>
   <subtitle>INTERNAL SCISSION</subtitle>
   <p>Simultaneously an explosion and an implosion, Spence’s double detonation is the solipsistic collapse into singular self, into the private oneness of unique Being, the eternal natal bond with one’s own experience. But it is also a dehiscence, the epiphanic burst, the moment of recognition that this unique and singular self is <emphasis>other,</emphasis> open, several, double, expansive, fully predicated by the reciprocal gaze of self-reflection: simultaneously centripetal and centrifugal. “The reflection finds itself therefore in the strange situation of simultaneously requiring and excluding an inverse movement of constitution” (Merleau-Ponty <emphasis>Visible</emphasis> 45).</p>
   <p>Spence’s recognition (<emphasis>anagnorisis</emphasis>) comes from within, producing the kind of “secret” knowledge the Greeks called <emphasis>gnosis</emphasis> (re-cognition). <emphasis>Gnosis</emphasis> is self-knowledge, intuition, insight, creative production, not remembrance or remembering of the psychic body of memory (as in the Platonic “recollection” called <emphasis>anamnesis</emphasis><a l:href="#n_30" type="note">[30]</a>)—it is an unveiling, what Parmenides called <emphasis>aletheia.</emphasis> As the un-concealment of forgetfulness, <emphasis>aletheia</emphasis> combines the Greek prefix a- (to be without, outside) with forgetfulness (<emphasis>lethe</emphasis>). Mark Taylor unpacks this notoriously difficult conception revived by Heidegger: “To un-forget the origin is to remember <emphasis>that</emphasis> one has forgotten and to recognize that such forgetting is inescapable” (51). In this view, truth is a state of Being that emerges, opens in a clearing or constellation of contradictions, a notion of truth and reality that dominates Dick’s late novels (particularly <emphasis>VALIS).</emphasis> It is also a notion implicit within the early stories, and in rereading them this way we too access the moment of recognition, clarifying that this is a readerly moment, although it takes the form of dehiscence. For to read the story is to reproduce its crisis of reflection, to produce one’s own <emphasis>dianoia,</emphasis> to recognize how I myself am an impostor.</p>
   <p>“Impostor” explodes the modern myth of self-identity, showing its full reciprocity with and dependence on its other: If to be human is to empathize, to superimpose self on other, and if to be I is always to be you, then we must rethink all the old categories and conventions, both of ontology and of ethics. And to rethink received truths—<emphasis>doxa</emphasis>—is not this the “great task” of literature? The reason Dick must rank with the most important writers of our generation? “Impostor” mirrors the modern confrontation with what Merleau-Ponty called “hyper-reflection,” what Baudrillard calls “the pure simulacrum,” what Derrida calls <emphasis>“différance”</emphasis> and what Dick calls-simply, directly, passionately—our life.</p>
   <subtitle>NOTES</subtitle>
   <p>1. Whatever his failures as a stylist, and they are several, Dick is arguably among the major writers of the contemporary era. Istvan Csicsery-Ronay, in his Introduction to <emphasis>On Philip K. Dick,</emphasis> goes as far as calling Dick “the single writer most responsible for the acceptance of SF as a dominant genre of literature in the second half of the 20th century” (v), an extraordinary declaration that, in true Dickian fashion, he immediately subjects to comment: “This is a bold claim. I can hardly believe I’m making it. But I simply can’t avoid it.”</p>
   <p>2. “Paralogy” is the heterological program proposed by Lyotard (60−67). For clear discussions of the history of reflexivity and the problematics of reflection, see, respectively, Gasché (especially 14−78) and Merleau-Ponty (<emphasis>Visible</emphasis> [28−49]).</p>
   <p>3. A tiny portion of this journal was published as an appendix to <emphasis>VALIS’,</emphasis> a substantial section has now appeared as <emphasis>In Pursuit of VALIS,</emphasis> hereafter <emphasis>Exegesis.</emphasis></p>
   <p>4. By <emphasis>heterology,</emphasis> a term which according to Blanchot derives from Georges Bataille, I mean to identify the specifically poststructural dialectics of ipseity (selfhood) and alterity (otherness); heterology, then, demarcates what in <emphasis>The Visible and the Invisible</emphasis> Merleau-Ponty called “hyper-reflection” or “hyper-dialectics”—“dialectics without synthesis” (50−104). This unresolved but regulated play is crucial to any understanding of Dick’s heterodox thematics.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Heterodox</emphasis> is the antonym for <emphasis>orthodox,</emphasis> which in Greek literally means “straight thinking,” underscoring the fact that Dick’s writing is marked by difference, the loopy lines of heterodoxy; in “Impostor,” difference operates as the ironization or problematization of <emphasis>doxa,</emphasis> the conventional wisdom we inherit from our culture and perpetuate as a kind of naturalized belief. First among these conventions is our notion of the subject, which we typically assume has the clear and distinct, unique and singular status Descartes assigned it. I will return to this notion later.</p>
   <p>5. In <emphasis>The Collected Stories,</emphasis> this sentence gives “than” rather than “then,” which I read as a simple typographical glitch since earlier editions of the story offer “then.” The typo does, however, provide an inspired intensification of the alienation effect of the story’s final lines. When the text first appeared in 1953, the title’s spelling was “Impostor,“ an acceptable alternate for the more conventional “imposter”; this alternate spelling is consonant with that in the <emphasis>Exegesis.</emphasis> Consequently, I use “impostor” throughout.</p>
   <p>Another revealing typo can be found in another story about reversibility and reinscription, “The Exit Door Leads In” (5:315−31). After spilling coffee on a friend’s suit, a woman tries to clean the stain, and in failing she remarks “It won’t come off”; to which her friend replies: “Symbolism” (326). Yet the text gives “I won’t come off,” neatly marking how the stain of Cartesian subjectivity remains forever with us, forever inscribing an “it” that reflection cannot confirm. I’d like to read these typos as instances of <emphasis>parapraxis</emphasis> (the Freudian mistake or “slip” that reveals a repressed motif). Perhaps Dick would be pleased.</p>
   <p>6. “Paianoia . . . is the fullest extension of the noniterabiltiy of personal experience, and it is aggravated, not diminished, by the specificity and precision of the language games applied and the language they furnish” (93); Sussman is discussing a question within Wittgenstein, but the definition of paranoia applies extremely well to Dick.</p>
   <p>7. In “The Sublime Simulacra: Repetition, Reversal, and Re-covery in Lem’s <emphasis>Solaris,”</emphasis> I provide a detailed reading of the Freudian problematic of <emphasis>unheimlichkeit</emphasis> in <emphasis>Critique: Studies in Contemporary Fiction</emphasis> 36:3 (Spring 1995).</p>
   <p>8. In <emphasis>VALIS,</emphasis> Horselover Fat’s alternate personality, who lived circa 45 C.E. during Roman/Hellenistic times, is “Thomas” (109−11, 155). Given Dick’s concern in that novel with the Nag Hammadi Gnostic texts, the conspicuous silence on “The Gospel of Thomas” (the “secret” sayings of Jesus), generally acknowledged to be the most significant of these books, is extremely odd, for this Gnostic gospel underscores the thematic of the double and was available in English in a popular edition as early as 1963 (trans. George Ogg, <emphasis>New Testament Apocrypha,</emphasis> London: Lutterworth). Thomas, tradition has it, was Christ’s brother; in Aramaic, <emphasis>thomas</emphasis> means “twin.”</p>
   <p>9. Dick’s use of the phrase “flattening of affect” derives from his reading of 1930s and 1940s psychiatric descriptions of schizophrenia. See Gregg Rickman’s discussion of Dick’s conception of schizophrenia in Chapter 8.</p>
   <p>10. Dick tellingly commented that readers do “the same thing when [they] read SF that I’m doing when I write it” (5:394).</p>
   <p>11. <emphasis>Noumenon</emphasis> is Kant’s neologism for the thing-itself, as distinct from the <emphasis>phenomenon,</emphasis> the only “thing” we experience.</p>
   <p>12. See <emphasis>A Thousand Plateaus,</emphasis> volume 2 of <emphasis>Capitalism and Schizophrenia.</emphasis></p>
   <p>13. Naming Merleau-Ponty a poststructuralist will offend some. My reading of the later Merleau-Ponty finds him consonant with the poststructural models of Derrida and Deleuze, but there remain certain scholarly disputes over Merleau-Ponty’s view of how, or if, language mediates “nonreflective perception” (<emphasis>Prose</emphasis> 138). See, for example, his own “Dialogue and the Perception of the Other” in <emphasis>The Prose of the World,</emphasis> or the disputatious commentaries collected in <emphasis>Ontology and Alterity in Merleau-Ponty.</emphasis> Derrida’s reflections on the problematic of otherness appear in <emphasis>Cinders</emphasis> and “<emphasis>Psyché:</emphasis> The Invention of the Other.”</p>
   <p>14. In Lévinas, the two are linked by conceptions of ethical relation; “the . . . word other, in Lévinas, means the transcendence of another person: the infinite relation of one person to another obligates beyond any obligation” (Blanchot 109). See particularly Lévinas’s <emphasis>Otherwise than Being, or Beyond Essence.</emphasis> I wish to thank Michael Beehler for suggesting to me the crucial significance of Lévinas’ thought on this question.</p>
   <p>15. Substitution on the basis of difference is a metaphor; Aristotle’s definition resonates wonderfully with Spence’s dilemma: “Metaphor is the application of an alien name” (295/1456b). Note that Dick’s metonymy is itself structured metaphorically.</p>
   <p>16. Rather than an antagonist, Spence<sub>2</sub> is what Mieke Bal calls “an anti-subject” (32).</p>
   <p>17. To “place under erasure” is not to destroy but to problematize, and it does not result in “the death of the subject,” a phrase that recalls not only Barthes but Nietzsche. Durham addresses “the death of the subject” within <emphasis>The Simulacra</emphasis> (where Dick configures an I-world and a not-I [cf. 224—25]), <emphasis>Now Wait for Last Year, A Scanner Darkly,</emphasis> and <emphasis>VALIS.</emphasis> He argues that, for Dick, late-capitalist culture and hallucinatory drugs (and, we could add, religious mysticism) are isomorphic, since both serve to dissolve the Cartesian subject. Palmer thinks this a “retreat into textuality” (“Postmodernism” 338); but for Dick, even quotidian events are textualized, or intertextual, in the manner of Derrida’s statement that “there is nothing outside the text” (<emphasis>Of Grammatology</emphasis> 158). Problematizing <emphasis>doxa,</emphasis> then, is a confrontation rather than a retreat.</p>
   <p>18. Dick’s understanding of <emphasis>anamnesis (VALIS</emphasis> §8.111), probably drawn from haphazard reading in secondary sources, is adapted not from Plato but instead conforms to doctrines of Plotinus’ Neoplatonism. Partial confirmation of this point is that Dick’s Greek is the Hellenistic <emphasis>koine (VALIS passim),</emphasis> the common Greek dialect used to write both the New Testament and the Septuagint. Dick’s reading of the Gnostics (64—69) is similiarly one-sided; <emphasis>gnosticism</emphasis> remains an umbrella term which groups together a fairly diverse set of doctrines and practices. Dick’s idenitification of <emphasis>gnosis</emphasis> and <emphasis>anamnesis</emphasis> (96) is his own position, neither Plato’s nor Plotinus’. Plotinus tried to refute the Gnostics even as they appropriated and altered his thought, just as he had done to Plato. See James Robinson in <emphasis>The Nag Hammadi.</emphasis> For Derrida’s discussion of how Platonic <emphasis>anamnesis</emphasis> produces simulacra, see <emphasis>Dissemination</emphasis> (95−117, 168).</p>

    <p>Worlds of Chance and Counterfeit: </p>
    <p>Dick, Lem, and the Preestablished Cacophony</p>
    <p>by Karl Wessels</p>
   </title>
   <p>In his 1975 essay “Artifice as Refuge and Worldview: Philip K. Dick’s ‘Foci’ ” Darko Suvin lamented Dick’s increasing preoccupation in his later works with private anxieties and opaque metaphysical riddles, at the expense of his earlier social and political concerns (Greenberg and Olander 73−95). It is true, for example, that many of Dick’s early works dealt either explicitly or implicitly with the cold war and the self-destructive paranoia it engendered within the American body politic; one need only recall novels such as <emphasis>Eye in the Sky</emphasis> (1957) and <emphasis>Time Out of Joint</emphasis> (1959) or short stories like “The Defenders” (1953) and “Foster, You’re Dead” (1955) to see Suvin’s point. After his “Faith of Our Fathers” (1967), a story perhaps best described as Maoism turned metaphysical nightmare, it is also true that Dick’s overt interest in political themes began to recede, though it can still be seen in an example such as the posthumously published <emphasis>Radio Free Albemuth</emphasis> (written 1976, published 1985).</p>
   <p>It is curious, however, that Suvin should have imagined that sociopolitical concerns are not also ontological ones, to which they stand in the relationship of species to genus. Dick’s trademark question, “What is real?”, is too easily taken for granted. “Esse est percipi.” Bishop Berkeley said: To be is to be perceived. It was one of Dick’s earliest insights that politicians and their handlers understand the Bishop’s meaning all too well, for the manipulation of representations of the real is the everyday bread and butter of political life. He also knew that due to the proliferation of mass media, the opportunities for dissimulation have increased exponentially in recent times. It so happened that the beginning of Dick’s own writing career coincided with both the advent of television and the early days of the cold war and the red scare. A close look at this confluence of events should prove revealing.</p>
   <p>The theme of forgery is ubiquitous in Dick’s writing, taking both a concrete and a metaphysical form in a novel such as <emphasis>The Man in the High Castle</emphasis> (1962). In the first case we see the counterfeiting of familiar physical objects such as cigarette lighters and old magazines, in the second the falsification of memories and of reality itself, a possibility whose meaning occupied Dick ceaselessly. Why should this have been so? In particular, what constituted the <emphasis>political</emphasis> connection for Dick between the ontic and ontological, the being of particular things and Being itself, that such falsifications should be possible?</p>
   <p>Unremarked by the critics, Dick’s forgery theme seems to have possessed short, direct links to the American political environment of the late 1940s and 1950s, the era of the witch hunt.</p>
   <p>The defense strategy used by Alger Hiss in his perjury trial, for example, was predicated on the thesis that certain damning documents ascribed to Hiss were in fact forged on a typewriter that had been tampered with to mimic his own,<a l:href="#n_31" type="note">[31]</a>; similar forgeries had become a cottage industry during World War II intelligence operations. In his novel <emphasis>Martian Time-Slip</emphasis> (1964), Dick erected a statue to Alger Hiss, “the first U. N. martyr,” on the Martian plain (§1.14). It seems clear that Dick was familiar with the facts of the Hiss case, which launched the career of Richard Nixon, later on Dick’s <emphasis>bête noire.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Was the idea behind the Hiss defense farfetched? Apparently not. Senator Joseph McCarthys staff, for example, soon began producing such forgeries as a matter of course. The initial test of McCarthy’s favorite means of manipulating perceptions came in the fall of 1950 when his staff assisted in the defeat of McCarthy’s political adversary, Senator Millard Tydings of Maryland. This campaign featured a technique that was to become a McCarthy staple, the doctoring of documents. McCarthy’s underlings produced a fraudulent composite photograph showing the conservative Tydings engaged in pleasant conversation with the U.S. communist leader, Earl Browder. What this fake insinuated was not only false but absurd: The reactionary Tydings had himself once cited Browder for contempt of congress.<a l:href="#n_32" type="note">[32]</a> Had life imitated art? In George Orwell’s <emphasis>1984</emphasis>, published two years earlier (1948), exactly the converse of the Tydings affair occurs—a historically accurate photograph of Big Brother (Stalin) holding conversation with Goldstein (Trotsky), the only one still in existence, is taken from Winston Smith by O’Brien and destroyed. The revision of history, it seems, can be accomplished either by the creation of false memories (paramnesias) or the excision of true ones (amnesias). Inevitably the theme of the dissociation of memory, like that of the generation of paranoia, became one of the central concerns of the fiction of Philip K. Dick.</p>
   <p>There can be no doubt that Dick was profoundly affected by the conspiratorial “reality” that McCarthy had constructed during his period of ascendancy. In 1953 Dick himself was repeatedly interviewed by FBI agents, whose object it was to convince him to inform on leftist radicals.<a l:href="#n_33" type="note">[33]</a> When without his knowledge a story of his later appeared in the Soviet propaganda magazine <emphasis>Ogonek,</emphasis> Dick feared he might get subpoenaed to appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), as had so many other writers before him. McCarthy’s attack on the International Information Administration in 1953 found a reaction in a letter Dick wrote to its successor, the United States Information Agency (USIA), as late as 1974, during the most disturbed period of his life (<emphasis>Selected Letters: 1974</emphasis> 39). It is clear that Dick felt trapped within a false reality from which he couldn’t seem to extricate himself, and began to explore its meaning through a series of science fiction short stories in which he took care never to name the actual object of his dread.</p>
   <subtitle>DICK’S PARANOIDS</subtitle>
   <p>One of these stories was “Shell Game” (3:189−202), a profound little exploration of the nature of collective paranoia. While “Shell Game” is neither one of Dick’s best nor best known stories, like several of his efforts of the time (1954) showing signs of hasty composition and overutilization of stock SF devices, it is nonetheless a fascinating example because its central argument can be formulated almost in mathematical terms, rendering its implications unusually clear cut. Dick’s gambit, “How might one prove to a paranoid that he’s deluded?” is simply an operational variant of his trademark “What is real?”. One can only wonder how Dick’s failure to answer his own question positively—a false failure, as it turns out—might have influenced the later course of his career.</p>
   <p>The situation depicted in “Shell Game” is typically byzantine. A group of “colonists” has crash landed on an alien world. Five years later they have come to believe that they’ve been repeatedly attacked with poison gas by unknown forces, though hard evidence for this hypothesis is oddly lacking. Mutual suspicion runs rampant in the camp, driven by the belief that the camp has been infiltrated by a spy. Meanwhile, a disturbing fact has come to light that suggests to several among the group that they may all be suffering a paranoid delusion, that the attacks may exist only in their own minds. Their damaged spaceship has just been recovered from a swamp and its layout suggests that it had not carried colonists at all, but rather psychiatric patients bound for an insane asylum light-years away. None of the colonists can remember this journey any longer. Thus Dick sets up one of his most characteristic premises, that of the link between amnesia and paranoia.</p>
   <p>Are the colonists mad or not? Can the mind ever know itself in its madness? One of the colony leaders, Fisher, anguishes, “Look, we’re going around in circles. We’re trying to measure ourselves. You can’t take a ruler . . . and ask it to measure itself. No instrument can test its own accuracy” (197). Rather than resign himself to this kind of paralytic paradox, a second colonist, Portbane, suggests a surprising way out of the trap, a means to establish, once and for all, the truth or falsity of the group’s consensual belief system.<a l:href="#n_34" type="note">[34]</a> “I can put together a valid, objective test” he claims. “And inside of a week, I’ll have it set up” (197).</p>
   <p>At the time of the next supposed gas attack, a sample of the poison is collected from the camp’s defensive perimeter. A second, control sample is then taken from the center of the camp. Both samples are exposed to litmus paper, the point being that if gas is present it will change the color of the litmus.</p>
   <p>Crucially, the two samples are then randomized; none of the colonists, including the test’s designer, know which sample was taken at the perimeter, which at the base (thus the shell game metaphor). The two samples are then presented to each of the nine colony leaders. To avoid any possibility of influence by one of them upon another, the question asked of each is answered by means of a secret ballot.</p>
   <p>The question is, “Which of the two samples was taken at the perimeter?” It is understood that no one will answer that both samples are positive, since if the base sample were positive the test taker would be dead and thus unable to take the test. On the other hand, it is possible that both samples will be perceived to be negative, a symptom of false alarm that might be resolved later on by repeating the test. In fact, this isn’t what happens: Each subject perceives that one and only one of the litmus samples is positive.</p>
   <p>The logic of the situation, which resembles a double-blind psychology experiment, is therefore well established. The crux of the matter is that what is being tested for is not the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a particular physical event, but a set of perceptions about its occurrence or nonoccurrence. The point of contention is the nature of agreement itself: A hypothesized delusion has been made contingent upon a hypothesized hallucination.<a l:href="#n_35" type="note">[35]</a> How then, Dick asks, might one sever the mechanism of unconscious collusion from the shared belief system of a group of experimental subjects, in order to determine whether their beliefs are being generated by suggestion rather than by something objectively real?</p>
   <p>The answer is to randomize the test samples and isolate the subjects. In the event that it is actually found, a result which remains intersubjectively invariant though obtained in the absence of influence must mark the presence of something objectively real.<a l:href="#n_36" type="note">[36]</a> If, following Wittgenstein’s metaphor of the language game, each colonist’s belief about the events transpiring at the camp’s perimeter is dependent on his understanding of the application of a socially learned rule of perception, then his experimental isolation from his fellows must sever the rule from its means of implementation. What is real is whatever constant residue remains.</p>
   <p>All of this is but the necessary prologue to what follows. Now the results of the experiment must actually be checked. If, despite the statistical barriers of randomization and isolation all experimental subjects agree on one result (e.g., “Sample A is positive”), the hypothesis that all are suffering from a paranoid delusion must stand disconfirmed. (The odds against all of them agreeing by accident is 1 in 256, the same as that of flipping nine consecutive heads or tails of a fair coin.)</p>
   <p>If, however, a mixed result is obtained, a different picture will emerge. In particular, the more nearly it should approximate the mean result of the binomial distribution for this experiment—a 5:4 split opinion—the more likely it would appear that the colonists are delusional. In fact, this is what happens. Though each colonist would prefer to believe that his choice has been determined by a real event, the disagreement within the group is best modeled by pure chance. Each of them might as well have based his choice on the flip of a coin. Dick’s colonists have proven themselves paranoid.</p>
   <p>Or have they? Unfortunately for the peace of the colony, no such simple solution to the riddle is possible. Once this fact is understood, the violent disintegration of the group immediately commences. Why? Because a crucial feature of the situation has not been reflected in the form of the experiment; moreover, the performance of the test itself crystallizes the nature of the omission, with consequences that are dire.</p>
   <p>Either the litmus has turned positive or it has not; a belief about that fact either is or is not delusional. What has been overlooked is that any statement a test taker makes purporting to express his belief about the litmus may or may not be dissimulated. Whether or not he lies is independent of whether or not he is deluded. The paranoid imagination is by nature prone to assume that any opinion in conflict with its own <emphasis>must</emphasis> be a lie.</p>
   <p>There are at least two different possibilities of deception in this situation: The hypothetical deceiver may either state an opinion opposite to the one he actually believes, or he can give a prerehearsed response, one that may or may not turn out to agree with what he has observed. In this case his purpose must be to disarm his adversaries by convincing them that they are insane; the motivation for such deceit is clear from Dick’s plot, since he has already set the premise that a spy (or spies) may have infiltrated the colony. It is possible that the test has been corrupted by influence after all, in the form of prerehearsal, despite the safeguards taken to avoid it. The test designer may himself be a spy; in the kingdom of the mad, the least mad mind must become suspect.</p>
   <p>It is important to analyze this situation carefully, the better to understand it. If in such an experiment all subjects are delusional but truthful, then the result of the test should lie reasonably close to the mean of the chance distribution. (The 5:4 split will occur in 49% of such instances, the 6:3 split in 33%, the 7:2 split in 14%, the 8:1 in 3.5%, the 9:0 split in less than 0.5%). If half of the colonists are delusional but truthful and half delusional but lying—in the sense of reporting the opposite of what they believe—then exactly the <emphasis>same</emphasis> result can be expected. Randomized lies will not affect the distribution.</p>
   <p>Suppose the second type of case: that a group of conspirators among the test subjects has prearranged to answer in a particular way before the question is asked (“the four were plotting in unison”). On the assumption that the nonconspirators have all answered randomly, then any strategy chosen by the conspirators that does not itself mimic randomness will likely skew the distribution of the final tally away from the chance mean. But this is not what happens in “Shell Game”; in fact, the mean result—the 5:4 split—is obtained.</p>
   <p>At this point, any subject contemplating the test results must confront two possibilities. Either he and his comrades are deluded and the results the product of sheer chance, or his own choice was correct and determined by the data, in which case a conspiracy must exist that includes roughly half of the test takers, each of whom has chosen to pretend the opposite of what he has seen. In Dick’s scenario, a genuine conspiracy involving half of the population will precisely mimic the effects of a collective paranoid delusion. The experiment has achieved nothing, except to crystallize within each paranoid’s mind the possibility that he has been subject to an organized conspiracy.</p>
   <p>Things get worse. On the face of the evidence alone, there is nothing to choose between the two possibilites. All may be deluded or half may be liars. However, the utilities (as opposed to the probabilities) implicit in Dick’s story must clearly favor the paranoid’s conclusion that he is not delusional but has in fact been the victim of a conspiracy. He must act <emphasis>as if</emphasis> the conspiracy exists.</p>
   <p>If a colonist acts as though he is under attack and really is under attack (implying the reality of the conspiracy), he will try to kill his enemies, who will also try to kill him. <emphasis>Ceteris paribus,</emphasis> his chance of survival will be 5092;. If he acts as though he is under attack but is not, he will wind up killing innocent people. If he acts as though he is not under attack and is not under attack, nothing will happen. Unfortunately, if he acts as though he is not under attack but <emphasis>is</emphasis> under attack, he will surely die.</p>
   <p>The “minimax” solution to this game—that solution which minimizes the player’s maximum possible loss—is to act as if he is under attack, since the worst possible outcome for him, certain death, occurs only in the event that he does not so act.<a l:href="#n_37" type="note">[37]</a></p>
   <p>The possibility of collusional prearrangement, of an <emphasis>a priori</emphasis> conspiracy, therefore undermines Dick’s example of a test for objectivity; in fact, it has the opposite effect, increasing the level of collective paranoia. Although the possibility of collusional influence being exercised during the course of the experiment is eliminatable by secret balloting, no such assumption is safe with respect to arrangements made prior to the experiment. In general, it is almost impossible to prove the negative, that something could not have happened, and this fact is eternal grist to the paranoid’s mill. The most extreme variations of the disorder would rule out the possibility of isolating influences at any time, hence the paranoid schizophrenic’s telepathic obsession, his dread of the possibility of thought insertion. Given the hermetic assumption that there is no end to influence, the very meaning of objectivity is unthinkable.<a l:href="#n_38" type="note">[38]</a></p>
   <p>Even when he appears to do so, in reality the paranoid is never prepared to accept any ground rules; it is not the rules of the game that must remain fixed for him, but the outcome of the game. His world cannot be framed; beyond the frame’s edge always lurk invisible monsters. In order to maintain his belief system, which embodies the utility structure of a man who eternally imagines himself facing imminent extinction, he is willing to dispute that the rules are really the rules, or that anyone has in fact been following them and not other, hidden ones. This is a world without foundation, an infinite regress, an archaeological excavation into the <emphasis>ad hoc</emphasis> in which no bottom is ever reached.</p>
   <p>“We are digging the pit of Babel” Kafka once wrote, and for the paranoid mind it is so.<a l:href="#n_39" type="note">[39]</a></p>
   <p>Dick has caught the essence of this delusional pattern in “Shell Game” and yet has made an error, one that must change our evaluation of almost every aspect of his story, especially its conclusion.</p>
   <p>Suppose that instead of a single control sample of the litmus there had been many. The nature of a shell game must change as the number of shells under which one looks for the pea increases. It is true, of course, that no matter the number of such controls the paranoid can always imagine that a conspiracy of liars has acted to imitate chance.<a l:href="#n_40" type="note">[40]</a> Crucially, however, the proportion of perceived conspirators relative to the total number of test subjects must increase along with the number of controls to make this feasible. As the number of these controls itself increases relative to the number of test siibjects, agreement between any two of them on the identity of the positive litmus must eventually become unlikely given that, despite what they may think, all of them are only guessing.<a l:href="#n_41" type="note">[41]</a></p>
   <p>Given sufficiently many controls in Dick’s kind of experiment, though it would be impossible to prove to a paranoid that he has no enemies, it would be easy to prove to him that he has no friends. The collective paranoid delusion, driven as it is by malignant suggestion, is therefore reducible to a private psychosis just in case it is possible to sever the relevant lines of influence. In such instances, it is clear that the logical force of the argument must also amount to psychological force, since it would follow the paranoid’s line of least resistance, his tendency to maximize mistrust. Interestingly, the sort of Hobbesian madhouse that would result is not unlike the one which confronts us on the first pages of “Shell Game,” before the experiment has succeeded in crystallizing the objects of most intense suspicion. In a war of all against all, no one trusts anyone. If Dick had been aware of the effect of increasing the number of controls in his experiment, the arc of his story would have been circular, in the end looping back to its beginning. In fact, some of Dick’s uncanniest narratives, such as those of <emphasis>Ubik</emphasis> (1969) and <emphasis>A Maze of Death</emphasis> (1970), follow just such a trajectory. More importantly, far from constituting an invincible army, in this altered scenario Dick’s crippled paranoids would have been easy pickings for any real adversary. Historical examples of the kind are plentiful; for example, exactly this sort of vulnerability was demonstrated by the CIA during James J. Angleton’s notorious HONETOL mole hunt, leading to the paralysis for years of that agency’s counter-Soviet operations.<a l:href="#n_42" type="note">[42]</a></p>
   <p>In fact, the maladaptive nature of paranoia as a survival strategy has been the subject of intense research in recent years by game theorists who have analyzed the so-called “Prisoner’s Dilemma.”<a l:href="#n_43" type="note">[43]</a> Greatly simplified, the point is that in a mixed population of paranoids and nonparanoids, the disadvantages that accrue to nonparanoids in repeated encounters with paranoids are usually more than compensated for by the advantages they accrue in encounters with other nonparanoids, relative to the disadvantages accrued by paranoids in their encounters with other paranoids. It seems that the evolution of human cooperation has been deeply dependent on this principle, which overturns the naive perception that Darwinian selection must inevitably lead to virulent competition.</p>
   <p>One is still left to wonder what would happen if Dick’s colonists were able to foresee all of the possible outcomes of a test taken with extra controls. Would such a test be permitted to take place at all? What would his fellow colonists conclude about the person who had suggested it? Paranoia and highly developed simulative powers form an especially combustible mixture.</p>
   <subtitle>LEM’S DREAMER</subtitle>
   <p>If Dick was SF’s prophet of dissimulation, Stanislaw Lem is its prophet of chance. Since the two themes are deeply connected, like two subterranean rivers, it is no accident that we should find Lem’s most typical theme inscribed within Dick’s work, and Dick’s within Lem’s.</p>
   <p>In his discussion of Dick’s <emphasis>Ubik</emphasis> in his critical essay “Science Fiction: A Hopeless Case—with Exceptions,” Lem claims,</p>
   <cite>
    <p>One possible way to build a synthetic reality is to “encapsulate” the consciousness by connecting the brain of the person in question to a computerlike apparatus . . . . The most interesting puzzle is whether a “phantomatically imprisoned” man can divine the real state of things, whether he can distinguish the machine-simulated environment from the real one, by means of any one experiment.</p>
    <text-author>(<emphasis>Microworlds</emphasis> 77)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>In fact, an extensive literature on this theme exists, based on the work of the American philosopher Hilary Putnam.<a l:href="#n_44" type="note">[44]</a> The advent of “virtual reality” systems may one day bring us to the point where the types of experiments envisioned by Lem and Putnam become possible. The questions raised are quintessentially Dickian; they are examples of the “What is real?” constellation, which includes the key query of “Shell Game.”</p>
   <p>Another subtly different variant of the question occurs in Chapter 4 of Lem’s novel <emphasis>Solaris</emphasis> (1961), in the form of an astronaut’s attempt to determine whether or not he is dreaming. In trying to solve the puzzle, Lem makes the opposite epistemological error of the one Dick makes in “Shell Game,” attributing too much power to rational methods rather than too little. Like Dick, however, Lem must offer an unusually imaginative argument in order to fail in an illuminating way.</p>
   <p>Soon after arriving at the Solaris space station, a bizarre and frightening chain of events causes Kris Kelvin to wonder whether he may be suffering a nightmare, some creation of his own hallucinating brain. Like the colonists of “Shell Game,” he searches feverishly for a way out of his ontological labyrinth. He monologizes, “If only I could think up some experiment in logic—a key experiment—which would reveal whether I had really gone mad and was a helpless prey to the figments of my imagination, or whether, in spite of their ludicrous improbability I had been experiencing real events” (<emphasis>Solaris</emphasis> 49).</p>
   <p>Kelvin’s solution is to obtain a series of celestial position measurements from a satellite orbiting overhead, taking care not to look at them, and then to compute the same measurements himself with the help of the space station’s large computer. If the figures obtained from the satellite are only figments of his imagination, he reasons, it is impossible that they should coincide with those calculated at the station, since his brain would have been unable to fabricate such a matching series ahead of time.</p>
   <p>In fact, the two series coincide. Kelvin concludes that he is not dreaming and not mad. From this point, Lem’s elegant narrative proceeds on as if nothing were amiss.</p>
   <p>Kelvin’s argument is fallacious. Perhaps this is best seen with the help of a metaphor. Suppose that the scene Kelvin has just enacted were on film. Now imagine a film editor, one able to cut frames from the film, splice them together, alter content by inserting frames from other films, and rearrange them in any way he sees fit. If one imagines the satellite readout and Kelvin’s computer computation to occupy different frames of such a film, the editor, himself nowhere on the film, would be able arbitrarily to alter them and place them in any order, whether improbable or not, even, perhaps, mimicking ordinary physical causality. But all of this is simply an analogy for the activity of the unconscious; tautologies only lead in circles, and a tautology is just what Lem has produced. It is possible that Kelvin is at once Kelvin on celluloid and Kelvin the film editor; the first Kelvin is simply unaware of the activities of the second. Perhaps what has misled Lem is the assumption that all that is unconscious for the waking mind is revealed to consciousness in the dream; but it is not so. The dreamer’s consciousness and the waking man’s together form but a subset of the mind, a set that is complementary to a larger set of mental operations of which neither is aware.</p>
   <p>Lem has made the category error of treating dream data as if they were public data and therefore amenable to ordinary empirical tests; in the public world it makes no sense to talk about an inaccessible common cause—in this case the film editor—because no one can observe it. However, once one has already granted the possibility of the dream, the very premise of Lem’s thought experiment, then one cannot abolish by fiat that unconsciousness which is not the dream, for neither the one nor the other is accessible to public inspection. It is an empty gesture—a vacuous attempt at self-legitimation—to conduct a public style test upon the private contents of one’s own mind.<a l:href="#n_45" type="note">[45]</a></p>
   <p>Interestingly, Lem himself discusses the effects of such a hidden common cause, in a somewhat different context, in his philosophical novel <emphasis>His Master’s Voice</emphasis> (90):</p>
   <cite>
    <p>If two people not communicating with each other analogously translate an unknown text, one tends to think they have truly got to its “invariants,” that what they have obtained is objectively inherent in the text and does not merely reflect their personal preconceptions. . . . If people’s preprogramming is identical [however), the results of their investigations may coincide, even though they have not consulted each other . . . . Therefore we should not exaggerate the cognitive importance of such coincidences.</p>
   </cite>
   <p>For “two people” read “two film frames”; for “analogous translation,” “matching number series,” and for “preprogramming,” read “invisible film editor.” The structural point, which is about the deceptive effects associated with hidden common causes, is identical in Lem’s two fictional examples. The mind has its secrets of which the other part of the mind knows nothing, and in this sense a person is no different than a society.<a l:href="#n_46" type="note">[46]</a></p>
   <p>The “Shell Game” and <emphasis>Solaris</emphasis> scenarios are both based on experiments, the purpose in each case being to determine the existence and direction of flow of causal influence. If Kelvin’s unconsciousness in <emphasis>Solaris</emphasis> consists of that which is unavailable to a part of his mind about another part of it, the corresponding reality in Dick’s story is whatever information is unavailable to a part of a social group about the activities of another part of it. Each of the participants in Dick’s experiment can see that all sources of influence-direct, causal links between test subjects—are absent during the course of the experiment because of the secret balloting mechanism; presumably, more sophisticated forms of signaling could be neutralized by more sophisticated mechanisms, up to the telepathic limit. Unfortunately, nothing of this applies to events that might have taken place before the experiment commenced. Since there can be no end of hypothetical common causes, logic can provide no antidote to paranoid projections.<a l:href="#n_47" type="note">[47]</a></p>
   <p>Paranoia, often treated as a simple symptom, is itself a syndrome composed of many symptoms. Among them are threat inflation, chronic <emphasis>ad hoc</emphasis> reasoning, and the invalid attribution of causality. In turn, paranoid causal fallacies can be analyzed into two distinct types of errors about hidden (occult) causes: in the first case attributing divergent phenomena to hidden singular causes, in the second attributing convergent phenomena to distinctly different hidden causes. The many may flow from the one, or the one from the many. One can imagine that everyone in one’s town, from the high school janitor to the bank president, is part of the conspiracy from Alpha Centauri, or conversely that one’s own twin brother has been replaced by an alien—or an android. Philip K. Dick was a past master of both possibilities; “Shell Game” is an example of the first, and the precession of simulacra to be found in his books, linking him to postmodernist thinkers like Baudrillard,<a l:href="#n_48" type="note">[48]</a> provides sufficiently many examples of the second. The threat posed by the simulacrum, of course, is that it may diverge from its original in its future behavior, leading to effects that the paranoid is only too willing to imagine. It engenders suspicion because of its occult, mimetic, alien origin. It may eventually revert to type: What was once different and is now the same could one day be different again. Repeatedly, obsessively, Dick depicts this temporal dialectic of identity and alterity in his stories and novels, as he faithfully tracks the breakdown in the immune system of postmodern society.</p>
   <p>But he even goes beyond this. To the extent that paranoia is a symptom of the inaccessibility of crucial information—that is, information about causes rather than effects, of which we always possess a choking surfeit—it can only be aggravated by the presence of amnesic gaps in the memories of persons or groups of persons. One can assess the degree of causal independence of two events only by continuously observing them as one moves through time. Here we arrive at what may be the central theme of Dick’s work, which has inexplicably received little critical attention: that of the dissociation of memory, consciousness, and identity.<a l:href="#n_49" type="note">[49]</a> Inevitably, the presence of amnesia breeds suspicion of the occult common cause because the amnesiac cannot see what is happening beyond the curtain of time.</p>
   <p>Similarly, creatures of celluloid cannot see what the film editor is up to. Dick made explicit use of this metaphor in his paranoid-dissociative opus, <emphasis>A Scanner Darkly</emphasis> (1977). Elsewhere in his writing the metaphor seems to have evoked for him a venerable philosophical idea, that of the preestablished harmony, a notion favored by seventeenth-century thinkers such as Leibniz, Malebranche, and Geulincx. For these philosophers ordinary, linear causality was a misleading appearance: the counterfeit of an occult harmony established by God outside of time<a l:href="#n_50" type="note">[50]</a> Leibniz’ s God was an invisible clock synchronizer; by the same token, Dick’s invisible film editor was a Leibnizian editor. What distinguished Dick from the doyens of seventeenth-century idealism, however, was that for him the preestablished harmony looked more like a cacophony, the work of some sinister, gnostic demiurge. Dick had no use for Dr. Pangloss’s deduction of theodicy, that this is the best of all possible worlds,<a l:href="#n_51" type="note">[51]</a> but instead forever brooded like Ivan Karamazov over the problem of evil.<a l:href="#n_52" type="note">[52]</a></p>
   <p>Empirical means can never satisfactorily address such questions, or even some of the undecidable riddles of science itself, as Stanislaw Lem’s provocative explorations of the chain of chance have shown us. And yet they are sometimes more powerful than we imagine. Randomization, isolation, redundant control, and other statistical methods can help us distinguish the ideological from the ontological, the delusional from the real, the relative from the absolute. Where such means are unavailing, it is likely that there can be no theoretical knowledge of the human being at all, but only rhetorical self-deception.</p>
   <p>Lem’s translation thesis is answered by the fact that test subjects, like test items, can be randomized-if need be, over the whole human population. Theses of the indeterminacy of translation are contradicted in practice by the fact that people actually do learn and become proficient in new languages. How is this supposed to happen? Truth is social, but not in the constructive sense that the sociologists of knowledge would have it. The objectively real is whatever it is that perfect strangers already agree about before they first encounter each other.</p>
   <p>What this is cannot be established by Cartesian introspection or phenomenological navel gazing; that is sheer hubris.<a l:href="#n_53" type="note">[53]</a></p>
   <p>Without such a hidden, species-universal foundation, learning, communication, and cooperative action would be impossible. The infinite predicability of all objects guarantees this conclusion, as can be rigourously demonstrated.<a l:href="#n_54" type="note">[54]</a> The real is that which remains intersubjectively invariant in the absence of influence; it is the hidden <emphasis>consensus gentium,</emphasis> the unknown <emphasis>koinos kosmos.</emphasis> We dwell in it as a fish dwells in water, and we are as little aware of our medium as the fish is of his. If things were otherwise, we would no more be able to understand each other than the scholars of Lem’s His Master’s Voice project are able to understand their message from the stars. This principle of consensible, reproducible results provides us our only means of testing the reality of our beliefs, of surviving the postmodern labyrinth of influence. It is the zero point of knowledge.</p>
   <p>In the end Philip Dick himself found no solace in any statistical conception of truth, but only in his own strange and solitary gnosis. In this particular shell game, Dick made the shaman’s choice.</p>
   <subtitle>NOTES</subtitle>
   <p>1. See, for example, the account given in John Chabot Smith, <emphasis>Alger Hiss: The True Story</emphasis> (355−377).</p>
   <p>2. The account is given in Reinhard H. Luthin, “The Making of McCarthy,” from Earl Latham, Ed., <emphasis>The Meaning of McCarthy ism</emphasis> (12). McCarthy was up to the same tricks again in the Fort Monmouth espionage episode at the time of the televised Army hearings in the spring of 1954. This time, however, he made the mistake of forging an FBI document and had to withdraw his “evidence” (Latham xiii). Dick’s “Xerox missive” crisis twenty years later possessed a number of odd parallels to the incident, arguing for a degree of unconscious influence.</p>
   <p>3. Gregg Rickman, <emphasis>To the High Castle</emphasis> (238−240). It is possible that the FBI concluded that Dick could be manipulated after he had gotten into an argument at a Communist Party meeting he had attended with a friend (see Rickman, <emphasis>In His Own Words</emphasis> 122). Such meetings were frequently also attended by FBI agents incognito.</p>
   <p>4. Self-reference usually takes benign forms that possess no paradoxical implications. For example, if this were not the case the DNA code would not be able to replicate itself because it would not be able to specify itself without altering itself. Unfortunately, the self-referential paradox is one in a long list of technical ideas that have become distorted in their passage through the philosophy of criticism. It is important that Dick critics, in particular, begin to understand when and why these paradoxes become vicious, because some of Dick’s best works incorporate them.</p>
   <p>5. Dick’s argument might have possessed greater generality and intuitive credibility, if less dramatic effect, if he had not made it attend upon a sensory hallucination induced by suggestion. However, such effects have been known to experimental psychologists for decades. See Ernest P. Hilgard, <emphasis>The Experience of Hypnosis</emphasis> (1965).</p>
   <p>6. See Chapter 3 of John Ziman, <emphasis>Reliable Knowledge,</emphasis> or Chapter 11 of Henri Poincare, <emphasis>The Value of Science.</emphasis> For a variety of ideological reasons, Poincare’s kind of definition of <emphasis>objectivity</emphasis> is seldom credited within the literary culture. At point is the irrelevance to science of traditional “correspondence” theories of truth, favored strawmen of the French poststructuralist philosophers. The only correspondence that matters is the one that links two or more independently originating descriptions, and not a single description with some mysterious thing-in-itself. What is the likelihood that two observers, not in communication with each other, should agree about something given the infinity of possible alternatives? Much of the current debate about reference and representation thus shifts its ground to the theory of probability. In this kind of environment, poststructuralist ideas about reference tend to evaporate into thin air.</p>
   <p>7. The “minimax solution” is an idea deriving from the theory of games, which originated in Oscar Morgenstem and John von Neumann, <emphasis>The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior</emphasis> (1944). The frontispiece to Dick’s first published novel, <emphasis>Solar Lottery</emphasis> (1955), refers to von Neumann’s theory “bearing out my belief that Minimax is gaining on us all the time.”</p>
   <p>8. In contemporary literary theory the cognate of “influence” is “intertextuality.” Here as elsewhere the antithetical instincts of C. P. Snow’s two cultures are evident. See C. P. Snow, <emphasis>The Two Cultures and a Second Look</emphasis> (1964).</p>
   <p>9. Franz Kafka, “The Pit of Babel” from <emphasis>Parables and Paradoxes</emphasis> (35).</p>
   <p>10. From the paranoid point of view, as the number of controls increases, the strategy of the “conspirators” must change in order to maintain the “illusion” of chance; this would amount to randomizing answers over the increased set of choices minus one—the paranoid’s own.</p>
   <p>11. In general, for a fixed number, <emphasis>R,</emphasis> of randomly choosing test subjects, the minimum number, <emphasis>N,</emphasis> of test samples for which the likelihood is less than 509&amp; that some two of the subjects will agree is yielded by the minimum value of the ratio between the numbers of permutations of <emphasis>N</emphasis> objects taken <emphasis>R</emphasis> at a time with and without replacement, for which that ratio exceeds two to one. In particular, for <emphasis>R</emphasis> = 9, <emphasis>N =</emphasis> 55. In Dick’s experiment, in order to stand a better than 50−50 chance of proving to each of nine paranoids that he has no friends, you would need 54 control samples.</p>
   <p>12. See the account in Tom Mangold, <emphasis>Cold Warrior</emphasis> (1991). Angleton was the CIA chief of counterintelligence operations from 1954 to 1974. HONETOL was an acronym derived from the last name of J. Edgar Hoover and the first name of Angleton’s favorite KGB informer, Anatoliy Golitsyn. Angleton wanted to leave the impression that the FBI director was solidly behind his investigation, but this was not the case (245). HONETOL ruined the careers of a large number of CIA officers and eventually turned against Angleton himself.</p>

   <p>15. On the hypothesis that he had not dreamed the second set of measurements, Kelvin could not have dreamed the first set unless he were clairvoyant. But how could he know he had not dreamed the second set? This is the source of the circularity in Lem’s argument.</p>
   <p>The arguments tautologous (uninformative) nature can, however, be removed by recasting it in decision-theoretical rather than strictly inferential terms. The point is that if it is the case Kelvin did not dream the second set of calculations, then the result of his experiment would provide him a basis for deciding actions that he would not otherwise possess. In particular, should both sets match—as happens in the story—Kelvin would be advised to act <emphasis>as if</emphasis> he had not dreamed the first set. Leaving the question open simply because he might have dreamed the first set could result in a bad conclusion. The test is asymmetrical in its force, just as is Dick’s in “Shell Game”: In some cases Kelvin can prove he is dreaming, but he can never prove the contrary.</p>
   <p>Under what circumstances should Kelvin be able to infer he’s been dreaming? In the first place, he must assume that if he were awake at the times both calculations were made they would have matched, and that the satellite and space station computers are both accurate in reality. (But what is the epistemological basis of this premise? Was it determined in dream or in reality?)</p>
   <p>In the second place, Kelvin knows that he was either dreaming or awake at the time the two calculations were compared. If he were dreaming, then the case is already demonstrated. Suppose he was awake and that the two calculations did not match. At what point, and by what means, did he then pass from the dream to the wakeful state? If he were awake at the time of the second calculation, then how is it possible that the earlier dream calculation got placed in a real drawer so it might really be compared with the later one? It seems paradoxical to say that a fictional object and a real one can be compared in reality.</p>
   <p>There is no paradox here; we have simply confused the phenomenological and ontological aspects of the dream. Kelvin dreams he is receiving data from the satellite and dreams he’s not looking at it, while at the same time in reality, quite unconsciously, writing down a nonsensical sequence of numbers (automatic writing). He then dreams he is transferring these figures to the drawer while simultaneously, in reality, transferring them to the drawer. In principle there is no reason a somnambulist cannot dream he is doing what in fact he is doing. If the dream surrounding the initial calculation were sufficiently vivid, it need not have been qualitatively distinguishable from the waking state. Kelvin might have then passed imperceptibly from the one state to the other, or else have simply been amnesic for the moment of transition. He could have then completed the experiment and concluded he was dreaming when he ordered the satellite computation.</p>
   <p>Perhaps the larger question is whether it makes sense to ask the present-tense question “Am I dreaming?” If one is dreaming, to whom is one addressing the question? One’s dream self? Some personality in one’s dream? But if it is not possible even in principle for the dream listener to answer the question, is it a question at all? Maybe this was the import of Wittgenstein’s last words, written as he lay dying: “Someone who, dreaming, says ‘I am dreaming,’ even if he speaks audibly in doing so, is no more right than if he said ‘it is raining’ while it is in fact raining. Even if his dream were actually connected with the sound of rain” (<emphasis>On Certainty</emphasis> 89).</p>
   <p>It is arguable that the question only acquires meaning in retrospect. Even as the waking mind (sometimes) recollects the dream, it is possible that the dreamer recollects his waking life and thus anticipates that he will wake again. He may even aspire to an enhanced state of consciousness which recollects the dream that is ordinary wakefulness, as in wakefulness he recollects ordinary dreams: but there is no test he can use to reveal that he is dreaming. Phenomenological distinctions may not help distinguish reality from the dream. Their absence is the source of much of the uncanniness in Dick’s fiction, where such boundaries are instead suggested by narrative discontinuities.</p>
   <p>In his best novels, such as <emphasis>Ubik</emphasis> and <emphasis>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch,</emphasis> Dick plays many perplexing variations on this theme. Several critics have remarked on the Chinese puzzle-box nature of the nested realities to be found in these books. If one grants the premise that it only makes sense to speak about the dream one has had, rather than the dream one is having-by analogy to the hierarchy of types Bertrand Russell once constructed to resolve his own famous logical paradox—then what is one to believe when the last dream in such a sequence is also the first? And yet that is the situation Joe Chip encounters at the end of <emphasis>Ubik:</emphasis> “This was just the beginning.” It is as if the smallest Chinese box were to loop back, and consume the largest, reminding us that dreams have no size. Part of Dick’s fascination is the way in which his books remind us of other of our period’s oddest cultural artifacts, such as Godel’s theorem or Escher’s drawings (e.g., “The Endlessly Rising Staircase”). Douglas Hofstadter baptized these “strange loops” in his book <emphasis>Godel, Escher, Bach</emphasis> (1979), and Dick’s are among the strangest.</p>
   <p>16. The unitary natures of consciousness, volition, memory, and identity are among the lingering myths of Cartesianism. This psychological matter has nothing to do with “the disappearance of the subject” in postmodern criticism, which is a phenomenon of textuality rather than of lived life. Various aspects of the ways in which the mind comes apart are treated in Michael Gazzaniga, <emphasis>The Social Brain</emphasis> (1985), especially the author’s treatment of the effects of cerebral commisurotomy surgery, and in Colin Ross, <emphasis>Multiple Personality Disorder: Diagnosis, Clinical Features and Treatment</emphasis> (1989), which discusses the functional dissociations of MPD (now referred to as dissociative identity disorder [DID]).</p>
   <p>17. It might be argued, for example, that randomizing the values of <emphasis>R</emphasis> and A? at the experiments inception would make it impossible to prearrange an answering strategy. But this simply mistakes the relevant meaning of <emphasis>prearrangement.</emphasis> The best way to prearrange that the experimental outcome should look random is for the “conspirators” to in fact answer randomly over the reduced choice set, for any values of <emphasis>R</emphasis> and <emphasis>N.</emphasis> One effect of Dick’s approach in “Shell Game” is to define paranoia in terms of the projection of simulations and chance. In nature the purpose of a predator’s camouflage is to simulate the mean distribution of background objects so it will not be visible to its prey; one aspect of human paranoia derives from this hunter’s psychology.</p>
   <p>18. See Jean Baudrillard, “The Precession of Simulacra,” from <emphasis>Simulations</emphasis> (1983).</p>
   <p>19. Gregg Rickman suggests, on what appears to be the basis of substantial evidence, that Dick himself suffered from dissociative identity disorder (DID). See his <emphasis>To the High Castle</emphasis> (56, 413); his reply to Robert Philmus, “Dick, Deception and Dissociation,” in <emphasis>Science-Fiction Studies</emphasis> 54, rpt. in Mullen 262−64; and also Chapter 8 of this volume.</p>
   <p>20. Compare the following passage from Dick’s <emphasis>Exegesis</emphasis> (Sutin, <emphasis>In Pursuit of VALIS</emphasis> 122−23):</p>
   <cite>
    <p>That the spatiotemporal universe of multiplicity (physical things in time and space governed by causation) is in fact subsumed by at least one higher level of volitionally-imposed organization—and that such a structure is aware of us whereas we are not only not aware of it but normally unable to be aware of it-if this can be made the subject of indubitable observations it would lie beyond any discovery in the prior history of man.</p>

   <p>22. Dick: “One can almost-almost-view Satan’s activity as a high technology in which the simulation of world order is achieved” (<emphasis>Exegesis</emphasis> 111).</p>
   <p>23. In Lem’s <emphasis>His Master’s Voice</emphasis>, Peter Hogarth says (90),</p>
   <cite>
    <p>Somehow it has not occurred to any of our philosophers that to deduce from the pattern of one’s own thoughts, laws that hold for the full set of people, from the eolithic until the day the sun bums out, might be, to put it mildly, imprudent . . . . When, in formulating their theses of categorical imperatives, of the relationship of thought to perception-when did they conscientiously undertake to question, first, a large number of human beings?</p>
   </cite>
   <p>24. As the philosopher of science Marx W. Wartofsky puts it, “everything is like everything else in an infinite number of respects and different from everything else in an infinite number of respects” <emphasis>(Conceptual Foundations of Scientific Thought</emphasis> 129). A circle is simultaneously a closed curve, a convex curve, a curve of constant width, a curve possessing infinitely many axes of symmetry, a curve of algebraic degree 2, etc., <emphasis>ad infinitum.</emphasis> Two circles of different radii differ from each other in infinitely many different arc lengths subtended by infinitely many distinct central angles. How, then, are we supposed to imagine that the learning of “circularity” ever takes place? How do we come to understand the meanings of rules and categories, in the sense of standard practice?</p>
   <p>If the <emphasis>a priori</emphasis> probabilities are equal that each of infinitely many examples belongs to a given set of finite measure, then they are all equal to zero. Only if the infinite sum of such a sequence of probabilities is finitely covergent can learning take place; but this requires that the probabilities themselves be listable in some monotonically decreasing order, like the decreasing increments by which Achilles gains on the tortoise in Zeno’s paradoxical fable. It is exactly on this reef that Wittgenstein’s treatment of rule learning founders in his <emphasis>Philosophical Investigations</emphasis>; he is unable to explain how it is that different language games are ever learned, given that we are not born playing them. It is through learning theory—a subject greeted with blank stares by legions of postmodern relativists, conventionalists and sociologists of knowledge—that basic realism must inevitably return to the theory of knowledge.</p>

    <p>Philip K. Dick and the Nuclear Family</p>
    <p>by Christopher Palmer</p>
   </title>
   <p>Fantasy, as a literary form possessing a distinct mode and a distinct structure,<a l:href="#n_55" type="note">[55]</a> has attracted much recent attention. This attention is an episode in the politics of a literary criticism that has become intensely alert to the menace of ideological complicity that waits on every literary form and critical practice. Liberal humanist criticism is seen as having privileged “classic realism” and as having practiced a mimetic criticism on it. As the fiction of. for instance, George Eliot both reflects reality and reflects on it discursively, so liberal humanist criticism of Eliot’s novels both mirrors its text, rehearsing themes and moral implications without attempting theoretical distance, and it engages in sympathetic dialogue with its moral concerns and lessons.<a l:href="#n_56" type="note">[56]</a> If you turn to F. R. Leavis’s chapters on Eliot in <emphasis>The Great Tradition</emphasis> (1948), you find extensive quotation, linked by discursive commentary which approvingly specifies the author’s moral and political thinking. More recent criticism, on the other hand, privileges the fantastic, which is seen to subvert the ideology behind classic realism, not at the level of theme and social comment but at the level of form—a ruptured syntax of plot, dismembered characters, a refusal of explanation or closure.<a l:href="#n_57" type="note">[57]</a> There is a sharper split, likewise, between literary text and critical text; the latter does not mirror or attempt to serve the former. The critical text privileges both the subversive irrationality of the fantastic text and its own discursive rigor and theoretical acumen. By way of an unfair exaggeration, it could be said that the critical text arrogates to itself the right to discursive contention about politics, society, and related matters (that is, everything) while encouraging in the fantastic text the most thorough and radical dissolution of discursiveness.</p>
   <p>Science fiction, as an impure, often fantastic, often explicit form, presents an interesting challenge here. It might be said that by its adherence to extrapolation and explanation SF ensures that fantasy will always be under final (ideological) control, but the case is more open than that. This is not Flaubertian realism with the author absent yet in unrelenting control; it is narrative with the author present yet in sporadic control, as likely to venture on a neat closure as a self-conscious baring of his or her own artifice, yet unwilling to surrender either literary recourse.</p>
   <p>Philip K. Dick is a writer who mixes parable and fantasy with licentious impurity, and some of the problems and rewards of this emerge strikingly from a study of his short stories, which were mostly written in the period 1952−1955<a l:href="#n_58" type="note">[58]</a> often at the rate of several a week. The directness of these stories might surprise readers who know him by such novels as <emphasis>Ubik</emphasis> (1969), <emphasis>The Man in the High Castle</emphasis> (1962), and <emphasis>A Scanner Darkly</emphasis> (1977).</p>
   <p>The stories are often parables or polemics; their moral/political point is clear, yet they often dissolve the texture of reality, hollowing out nightmare worlds into which the “real” world may be sucked in a few moments, jeopardizing the epistemological confidence that would seem necessary for political judgments and moral actions. The world-transforming and world-dissolving imagination is at large in problematic ways in these stories; it would be gratifying to report that the result is a dialectical interplay between the demands of urgent political commitment and the energies of radical critique of the grounds of reality, but it will be found that the result is rather a fascinating instability and uncertainty.à</p>
   <p>Dick desires to ground value in the imagination but is alive to the way in which imagination may serve the powerful and destructive; that is, the opposition between a linear, rationalizing attitude and a free, fantasizing attitude only exists in a particular subset of his stories and is subverted elsewhere (because rationalizing is seen as a cover for destructive or oppressive fantasizing). He desires to ground value in the private life, seat of nurture, affection, creativity, but he sees the private life as vitiated by the outside world or poisoned by women’s withdrawal from nurture and creation. The criticism of society expressed is friendly to a socialist or feminist reading, suggesting the deformation involved in capitalist social relations and the power of patriarchy, but the values are liberal (affirming the individual’s capacity to repair destruction, or to refuse cooperation, to “balk” as Dick put it<a l:href="#n_59" type="note">[59]</a>). The context has been sympathetically examined in Barbara Ehrenreich’s <emphasis>The Hearts of Men</emphasis> (1983): the multiple, unexpected forms taken by the withdrawal of men from the values supposed to underpin capitalist, patriarchal society. But this context is refracted through Dick’s often painful and hostile feelings about women. The origins of these feelings are no doubt to be found in the author’s life; two recent biographies<a l:href="#n_60" type="note">[60]</a> have begun to bring this tangled story into light, from the death of his twin sister when he was an infant to his bittersweet relations with his mother and his wives and women friends. This chapter will, however, focus on other stories, the ones that Dick shaped (by using an inventive imagination), partly, at least, with the effect of illuminating the condition of his own society. When all the psychoanalysis of the life and of the stories in relation to the life has been done, insofar as biographers and critics are competent to do it, we still need to understand how this writer shaped (or mishaped) his fictions to reimagine the life of his society. This is the topic of this chapter.</p>
   <p>Two of Dick’s stories about typical families will set a framework for the discussion. In the first, “Human Is” (1955) (2:257−267), a woman is married to the very embodiment of impersonality, bloodless rationality, and careerism. The couple is childless. This man is repelled by children, finds eating tiresome, and is quite humorless. Presumably he is about as much fun in bed as a computer would be. The reader who could warm to this person, or mistake what he stands for, has not been born. Then, however, he returns from an expedition to another planet, quite transformed; he is now tolerant and considerate, loves cooking and kids; and his speech has changed, taking on a touch of archaic formality which lends it an odd charm, and (as his wife remarks) he now uses metaphors, which he formerly despised as inexact.</p>
   <p>The husband’s body has been taken over by an alien, a member of an ancient race desperate to escape its dying planet. What should be done about it? In learning the answer to this question, we learn more about the society which produced the husband in his former manifestation. The alien must be eliminated: Of this the authorities have no doubt; a swift “vibro ray” to the head will do the job. But before they can act, a legalistic condition must be fulfilled: The wife must witness that this is not her true husband; fortunately, the alien has merely stored the rest of the husband’s personality, so that when the intruder is killed, the husband can be reinserted and the former marriage can resume. (The conditions of the universe in which personalities can be removed and substituted would seem to make it implausible that the aliens would store what they removed and would allow it to be replaced—but who are we to judge this other race in our ruthless terms?) In the climactic gesture of the story, the wife refuses to bear witness. The authorities are powerless, and the wife and her kindly alien, with their newly adopted child, will live happily ever after.</p>
   <p>The story is a parable; humanness is something earned, or lost, not innate; the individual can make a difference (for instance, by refusing to cooperate with the authorities). But it has elements of fantasy: The world can be abruptly transformed, and the transformation can be literal, not simply metaphorical. “Lester Herrick came back from Rexor IV a different man” (260): This is not to be read as mere phrase or buried metaphor. And the new, alien, but human Lester Herrick learned his humanity from books: “The Rexorians have only a vague knowledge of human beings . . . . The Rexorian idea of Terra is based on centuries-old Terran literature. Romantic novels from our past” (264−65). The arrival of a new Lester as if by magic suggests wish fulfillment, but his niceness is the product of his own fantasy—that humans are as they are depicted in books—a fantasy that reflects on this story. Nonetheless, the new Lester embodies Dick’s “credo” about humanness. “For me, ‘Human Is’ is my credo. May it be yours” (<emphasis>The Best of Philip K. Dick</emphasis> 449).</p>
   <p>Dick was just as emphatic about a later story, “The Pre-Persons” (1974) (5:275−296), which is equally direct in its morality and which outraged many readers. To those who were outraged he replied defiantly, in the words of Luther, “ ‘Hier steh’ Ich; Ich kann nicht anders.’ ”<a l:href="#n_61" type="note">[61]</a> Because the story is, for better or worse, offensive, whereas “Human Is” is unlikely to annoy anyone, it is worth discussing its morality and its fantasy, though this entails briefly digressing from our nominated period (the early 1950s).</p>
   <p>Like “Human Is,” “The Pre-Persons” is set in an outwardly typical American family and concerns what it is to be a person. In fact, it is a ferocious attack on abortion and on women. In the society of the story, a child is not legally a person until the age of twelve, and if a pre-person fails certain tests or is unwanted by his or her parents, then abortion can take place before this coming of age-abortion by vacuum pump, on the model of foetus abortion, in case anyone were in danger of missing the polemic point. This horrible state of affairs exists because women (feminists) wanted it; men have proved powerless in the face of women’s withdrawal from nurture and kindliness.</p>
   <p>This time the gesture on which the story hinges is the decision of the father of a boy slated for “abortion” to climb into the truck collecting children for elimination. He offers himself for abortion on the grounds that he can’t pass the tests and is not a person. This action dismays the functionaries who routinely carry out abortions (who are analogized with the functionaries who exterminated the Jews), and with this glimmer of hope the story ends-prospects bleak (Dick redrafted the ending to make it bleaker), moral imperatives brutally clear.</p>
   <p>The question of wish fulfillment presents itself differently this time. If we ask, “How did such a horrible institution as the abortion of twelve-year-olds come about in the world of the story?” then we can give two different explanations. One, from the text, is that it came about because women wanted it. The second, from conjecture, is that it came about because Dick wanted it; that is, he wanted to give literal, aggressive expression to his conviction that when a fetus is aborted a person is killed, so he made those to be aborted in the story undeniable, twelve-year-old persons; he harbored many hostile and troubled feelings about women, so he ascribed the institution to women. It is not necessary that polemic be subtle or civil; polemic may gain its power from repudiation of subtlety and civility as no more than the masks that hypocrisy wears; we cannot, then, object to the story’s polemic style. But SF gives its author very great scope for such wholesale and abrupt rearrangements of contemporary, consensus reality, and if we disagree that the movement to allow abortion stems from women’s withdrawal from nurture and kindliness, then this scope begins to seem a loaded matter, one the ramifications of which are worth examining. Even the humane Ursula Le Guin begins <emphasis>Always Coming Home</emphasis> (1985) by abolishing most of humanity, a frightening way to open space for a Utopian, unaggressive community based on dance and handicraft, as she herself knows, since she has dramatized the imagination of solving the “population problem” by obliterating most people in <emphasis>The Lathe of Heaven</emphasis> (1971). This does not mean that <emphasis>Always Coming Home</emphasis> has the same qualities as “The Pre-Persons,” but it does remind us that in SF the author reimagines worlds, and also shows us other people-perhaps perniciously-reimagining worlds.</p>
   <p>This reflection opens the way for a reexamination of Dick’s earlier stories. We may begin to see how Dick construed abortion as poisoning the springs of creativity, always threatened by the conditions of modern society, and often flowing with an intoxicating liquid anyway—and this fear becomes especially urgent when we consider that the social setting of “The Pre-Persons” is the nuclear family, itself a threatened and precarious source of value in Dick’s eyes. Dick’s social thinking was bound up with thinking about fantasy and other modes of creativity and how precarious or dangerous fantasy can be.</p>
   <p>Imagination may make new versions of the world, and worlds are remade, unmade, infiltrated, and subverted every couple of pages in Dick’s fiction, but this is seldom a game, exhilarating as it is for the reader to catalogue the dazzling reality inversions of a story like “We Can Remember It for You Wholesale” (1966) (5:157−174). There is always a value at stake and, at the same time, imagination is repeatedly the threat to that value, for it is the imagination of the evil or sterile that produces the world that cries out for remaking.</p>
   <p>It is remarkable how often sterility is a threat or a condition in Dick’s stories. This is most obvious with those stories, common in his output of the early 1950s, which treat war and power, which are strongly antimilitarist and anticapitalist. The setting is almost invariably a sterile wasteland, composed of slag, ash, trash, rust, the pulped, undifferentiated residue of a civilization which has destroyed itself and now nourishes nothing. Here all that survives is a few soldiers, tough but radically unsure of what is going on or whom they really ought to be fighting (“Second Variety,” 1953), or robots, supposedly doing the fighting on behalf of a humanity forced underground by radioactivity and the destructiveness of interminable technowar (“The Defenders,” 1953), or a giant gun, still relentlessly defending a civilization that no longer exists (“The Gun,” 1952). In these stories, the real enemy is hypertropied technology and the attitudes that give technology power. The earth’s natural resources have been destroyed or depleted, while technology not merely survives this process, but waxes more dominant. Thus we have societies that can produce robots that can reproduce themselves, or androids outwardly indistinguishable from people, or (to draw examples now from the later novels) weapons that have a “tropism” for human brain waves, or robot taxis that have a tropism for a customer, while the surviving humans have to make do with ersatz coffee, revolting synthetic pap for food, and tacky clothes. In the later novels in which this vision of a technologically advanced, materially destitute society finds more detailed expression, it is often the case that most people are sterile, or that the elite are sterile (<emphasis>The Penultimate Truth,</emphasis> 1964), or the handful of humans left alive is mostly sterile so that the prospect of a baby is a matter of “luck” and an occasion for celebration <emphasis>(The Game-Players of Titan,</emphasis> 1963).</p>
   <p>It tends to be the sterility of men that is more emphasized. Thus in <emphasis>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</emphasis> (1968) Rick Deckard checks his lead codpiece (for protection against radioactivity) before venturing from his apartment to hunt androids, which society can reproduce with dazzling efficiency. Indeed, to return to the short stories, in “The Last of the Masters” (1954) (3:75−99), it is the sterility of a robot with a male name, Bors. In the future sketched by this story advanced technology has been wiped out by an anarchist revolt everywhere but in a secluded valley where a super robot organizes and maintains a replica of the old civilization. The humans he rules are totally dependent on him, rusting and out of sorts as he is, and when he dies his achievement will die with him. (He is destroyed at the end of the story.) It is not clear why he does not replicate himself or educate his human servants: it is simply a given that he is sterile: the old, technologically advanced, highly organized civilization is a civilization of production, but under Bors it can now do no more than maintain itself.</p>
   <p>What we have, repeatedly, is a society in which everything delicate, artistic and domestic has disappeared, in which problems, replicating like mutants (or literally as mutants, as in “The Golden Man,” 1954) are faced with violence, in which society is organized in a state of war tension and war urgency. Given this, it is interesting that Dick never suggests at this stage of his career that the “feminine” side of life offers some sort of recourse. We shall approach the reasons for this when we come to stories with a domestic setting; meanwhile it is worth noting what sort of recourse is sometimes suggested in stories dealing with hypertechnology or, more generally, with production.</p>
   <p>In “The Variable Man” (1953) (1:163−219), twenty-second-century society is dependent on a vast computer which incessantly calculates the odds of victory in a war against an alien planet which blocks earth’s expansion into outer space. The humans who rule (we meet two main characters, one evil, one less evil) have evidently lost their capacity to invent and develop technology; we see this from the evil characters faith in the computer and his recourse to mega-violence (pulverizing a whole mountain range to eliminate one man), and the less evil one’s erection of a paranoid proliferation of weapon systems to protect himself from the first, his rival. He is directing work on a “faster than light” bomb for use against the aliens, but this cannot actually be completed because no one can understand the wiring. Nevertheless, the computer indicates that earth now has the edge over the aliens because of the nearly complete FTL bomb.</p>
   <p>The situation is thrown open by the arrival of the “variable man” (so called because he throws the computers calculation of the odds into disarray, and he is the unpredicted variable), a handyman inadvertently time-scooped from the early twentieth-century in the haste of war preparation. This man is a natural fixer; he fixes a child’s toy, by instinct, though quite ignorant of its electronics, and he is then used to complete the weapon’s wiring. He does this just before the evil figure, having failed several times to eliminate him, eliminates the less evil figure’s laboratory complex in a big, hypertechnological battle. These episodes of destruction certainly make the point about the mindless crudity of violence fueled by overdeveloped technology; meanwhile the variable man has rewired the missile so that it may carry a human not a bomb, thereby transforming the whole situation. The earth will no longer need to fight the aliens to reach outer space.</p>
   <p>In considering Dick’s short stories, we could speak both of an anxious questioning of the human, the human basis or center for society, and of an exhuberant breaking open of the category of the human. According to the latter possibility, it might seem woefully dull to speak merely of men, women, and children as human when there can be robots, mutants, androids, aliens, elves, speaking taxis, intelligent dogs, grimly astute spiders, an animate shoe seeking out, animating, and reproducing with a female shoe, a set of small creatures who incarnate Bach’s Goldberg Variations, and so on.<a l:href="#n_62" type="note">[62]</a> It is true that all these life forms are anthropomorphic, but it is also true that it is this which enables them to replace or compete with the “conventional” humans in some way or other. And they all seem to have the capacity for moral agency and the making of life choices. But it is the way of questioning and, if possible, reaffirmation that is taken, not that of playful celebration. “The Variable Man” reaffirms the single human center, the ordinary American (from 1910, the age of Edison) who can fix things, because technology has become destructive and out of human control.</p>
   <p>“The Variable Man” is one of several stories in which technology is as it were rehabilitated from within, by the rediscovery of the virtues of tinkering (as in “The Turning Wheel,” 1954), or of making rather than replicating, as in “Pay for the Printer” (1956). “Pay for the Printer” (3:239−252) is another story treating the dependence of consumers on processes of production of which they have lost control through ignorance—in this case the humans peevishly depend on benevolent aliens called Biltongs, who can replicate, or “print,” but cannot make and who have now become exhausted and sterile, worn out by what were originally efforts to save humanity from the consequences of the usual SF nuclear holocaust. (The Biltongs were first drawn to earth by the flashes of the holocaust, visible from outer space, and there set themselves, with kindly intent, to preserve the natives’ way of life by “printing” their artifacts.) At the end of the story, one of the human characters makes a crude, amateurish cup, without recourse to a Biltong, and this is a sign that civilization can remake itself, the hard way. Technology is reconnected to “hands-on” labor, and to craft, as distinct from science, in that repairing or making of this sort is a matter of trial and error and “feel,” not abstract reason and standardized process.</p>
   <p>The existential significance of repairing seems to be that it implies a dedication to maintaining the “individual” industrial product and breaks the circle of endless replication of exactly similar, standardized products. In Dick’s imagination products of this sort (that is, of the assemblyline industrialism which is most appropriately worked by robots, standardized machines making standardized machines, as is often the case in SF stories and is now happening in contemporary society) <emphasis>do not really exist,</emphasis> because they lack individuality, because each can merge in or be replaced by a designedly identical item. That is, his objection is not merely on social grounds—because this process disempowers the consumer, and even the technocrat, by making him dependent on a process of which he has become entirely ignorant, or which has become homeostatic. It is also on existential grounds—because this process violates some fundamental law which any reproduction (whether if be of people, or androids, or plants, or goods) ought to follow. A thing can’t be a real thing unless it is in some sense an individual thing. Thus the repairman or maker who restores thingness to industrialism is an individual, a variable man who disrupts abstract calculation and prediction, a quirky ordinary guy who refuses to go along with rationalizing power.</p>
   <p>It is interesting to compare Dick’s thinking here to that pursued in Octavia Butler’s <emphasis>Dawn</emphasis> (1987). In <emphasis>Dawn</emphasis> the human survivors of massive planet-wide destruction are rescued, reeducated, and (eventually) rebred by the alien Qankali, whose civilization, ethically challenging and probably superior to that of humans, is centered on biomodification of the most intimate and indeed erotic kind and allows absolutely no place for technology, so that tables, beds, bowls, and so forth are all grown, all organic. There exists nothing in Oankali civilization that is made and is therefore a dead, manipulable, or instrumental thing. And to this critique of technology Butler joins an imagination of the possibility that humans might need to abandon their humanity by interbreeding with the Oankali and becoming part of a new race. Dick, writing in the 1950s, still imagines the possibility of a humanly affirmative making: an individual person creating or fixing an individual thing.</p>
   <p>Individualism, the basis of liberalism, is thus vindicated, or offered as the only hope, in several of these grim, postapocalypse stories; but the short stories whose setting is closer to home are less confident. The domestic is the scene of consumption, not production, secluded from the centers of power and decision. The existential meagerness of everyday things is approached differently in this setting. In the stories whose setting is a war-wrecked earth or a sterile, hyperteehnological future, the main characters can hardly not know that their surroundings are ravaged and that they are powerless. In the domestic or smalltown stories, the main characters may be specified as cursorily as their homes, towns, and jobs, and that is a sign that they are not sufficiently differentiated from them to be able to know them.</p>
   <p>In “Breakfast at Twilight” (1954) (2:207−220), a typical family (husband just about to set out for the office, kids just about to set out for school, wife ready for a day in the kitchen and living room), gathered round the breakfast table in small-town America, is abruptly precipitated forward in time. They discover ash and radiation filling the familiar streets: Their town has almost been obliterated by bombardment (not surprising, because the bombardment is so severe that it has opened the space-time crack through which they have tumbled), and their society is transformed-all is organized for the war effort, children separated from parents, wives from husbands; books burnt, edible food scarce, people’s minds narrowed, and nerves stretched by war tension. The success of the story is the meeting of the family from contemporary America and the soldiers and official from the near future from whom they learn what life is like now—for the time is only seven years hence. (The headnote to the original magazine publication (<emphasis>Amazing Stories,</emphasis> July 1954) makes an interesting mistake here, announcing that the interval is a hundred years; this is what it “ought” to be, since the change is so great.)</p>
   <p>Though the two societies are totally different, they are close and connected, so the reality of each is jeopardized. The story suggests how thoroughly people naturalize that actuality which the hidden powers of history present to them as reality. Each society seems so all encompassing to its denizens as to be “normal,” and both parties are right, since peaceful domestic life is-must be-normal, yet bureaucracy and war have to be recognized as contemporary normality. Both are wrong, too; the contemporary life is narrow and illusory (power is elsewhere), the future life is straitened, lived in a mist of uncertainty.</p>
   <p>Mary, Tim, and their kids make their escape back to their own time by utilizing the same time warp that flung them out of it, but they cannot warn their neighbors what awaits them in a mere seven years. Tim fumbles over the words, no longer certain what is real; a neighbor suggests that the wreckage of their house (caused by the future bombardment) must be due to the explosion of their furnace, and they can only agree.</p>
   <p>Many of Dick’s short stories demonstrate the instability of their deliberately unremarkable settings. Stories of this type begin with a standardized version of the small town and small family which is supposed to be the Norman−Rockwellian repository of stable American values (values antedating standardization and deriving their authority from that fact). There is the husband, there the wife; here is the city hall, here the gas station. As SF, this is literature of ideas and extrapolations rather than literature of highly individualized characters, after all; individuality of character is a mere convenience, signified by giving the main character a distinct name, though in thousands of SF stories he is the same undifferentiated person (young, white, middle class male of average opinions). But in the Philip K. Dick stories of this type, everything dissolves around the main character almost as soon as it is sketched in. Because everything is typical, standardized, and immediately specified, it hardly exists, it may be dissolved, invaded, subtly infiltrated and modified, pitched forward or regressed in time, discovered to be a fabrication. It is monotonous, uniform, transient, and precarious. The moment of dissolution is often described, always horrifying (even when, as in “Adjustment Team,” the purpose behind it is benign, indeed, in that case, divine), almost always seen in the same way, as a matter of melting, thinning, wavering, so that the substance of things and even people loses body and you can see through, poke a hand through, sink into it or them. This is the rule of the “metamorphosis” that Jackson sees as a key and subversive element in fantasy.</p>
   <p>The setting of “The Hanging Stranger” (1953) (3:13−25) is the usual small town with typical buildings and stores, tired hurrying commuters; the main character, accidentally late for work, discovers a corpse hanging from the lamp post in the town park and then discovers that no one among his fellow townsfolk will acknowledge that it is there. He learns that this is because his fellow townsfolk are now possessed by, or have become, insectoid aliens-he sees the creatures descending in “a cone of gloom,” “a prism of black” over City Hall before merging with the citizens. Yet as he looks again, the people are the same: “Dulled, tired faces. People going home from work. Quite ordinary faces.” The rest of the story concerns how he makes it home, attempts to tell his family but has to kill one of his children when he realizes it is an alien, escapes to a nearby town, tells his story to the local police—and is then led out to hang from the lamp post of that town’s park, to serve in his turn as a lure to expose anyone who (like himself at the beginning of the story) has accidentally been missed in the alien takeover.</p>
   <p>When the main character discovers that his fellow citizens are indifferent to the hanging stranger, he discovers that those who had seemed as typical as himself are insect aliens, “pseudo men. Imitation men,” so that <emphasis>typical</emphasis> reveals its meaning as “hollow.” People are interchangeable and therefore prone to follow group feeling or to accept the horrible as natural, because they are without stable standards independent of the group. (“There must be a good reason, or it wouldn’t be there”—“It” being the corpse on the lamp post.) So far we connect the fable to social injustice—witchhunts or lynchings. The injustice cannot be re-dressed because no one will admit it has happened. But the broader implication of the story is that we are ready to be taken over or have already been taken over. The process itself has no intrinsic interest (the depiction of the aliens is unremarkable horror stuff) because it is the result of our readiness to be taken over. And it is appropriate to the story’s pessimism that the story has a circular form, and the individual through whom we saw everything is eliminated at the end, becoming another hanging stranger. The main character was merely part of the alien’s operating procedure, and merely helped Dick to tell the story; his resistance to what happened to the rest of the community offers no hope. In the last paragraph another man who had been overlooked is lured out to identify himself by his horror at the main characters corpse, to which everyone else is again indifferent.</p>
   <p>Dick’s sense of the precariousness of typical American life is free floating; the important thing is that the precariousness itself be demonstrated, that we see how open to takeover, infiltration, dissolution, or adjustment this life is. “The Commuter” (1953) (2:129−139) treats the main characters discovery that a suburb, complete with its own railway station, neat tree-lined streets, drug store where the local teenagers hang out, and so on, has been inserted into his city without anyone’s awareness. The means by which he stumbles across this are vivid (a typical peevish nondescript clerk tries to buy a ticket to a station that does not exist, and the main character is alerted by this incident); so are the consequences (when he returns from his visit to the inserted suburb, he observes buildings on his own street which he is not sure existed before, and when he gets upstairs he finds a wife and baby where formerly there was a girlfriend); but the “explanation” is a mere gesture (something to do with a rejected plan for a new housing development which has-evidently-gone ahead anyway) and there is nothing uncanny about the suburb itself. The instability and thus permeability of ordinary “reality” is the point, not whatever explanation the story offers.<a l:href="#n_63" type="note">[63]</a></p>
   <p>There is no equivalent in the more suburban or domestic stories to the repairman or craftsman who sometimes offered hope in the stories dealing with hypertechnology. The main character usually has an undefined job as a functionary in an office or store, and all he does in his story is discover and perhaps himself fall victim to the reality change. If anyone achieves something more hopeful it is, as we shall see, neither a man nor a woman but a child.</p>
   <p>So it is in “The Father-Thing” (3:101−110), an aliens-are-among-us horror story whose setting is domestic. A young boy, Charlie, discovers he has two fathers, the ordinary decent human one and a horrible alien one, denoted by chitinous hard eyes and the clear intention of getting the child into the garage and devouring him, so that he may be replaced by a “Charlie-Thing” of approximately the form and morals of a large maggot. (This is what has happened to his “natural” father, whom the alien is imitating, so that the first impression was that Charlie’s father was having a bad day, not “being himself’ very well.) Charlie arrests the process of infiltration in an interesting way: he calls upon two of his peers, one the local bully and tough guy, Tony Peretti; the other Bobby Daniels, “the little coloured kid” who is “good at finding.” Together they locate the aliens and destroy them with several gallons of kerosene.<a l:href="#n_64" type="note">[64]</a></p>
   <p>“The Father-Thing” hovers between metaphorical and literal; early in the story Charles is worried because his father is out in the garage “talking to himself,” and so he doesn’t know which one to tell to come to supper. There are literally two fathers out there. By the time Charlie and his peers kill the monstrous grub, the “real” father is gone forever (just as the “real” Lester is gone in “Human ls”); however, insofar as the monstrous grub is a metaphor for the way one’s father can sometimes seem, frizzling him with kerosene is not a proper solution. It is true that if we choose to read it as a revenge fantasy, stemming from Dick’s feelings about his own father, then this issue does not arise, since revenge must simply have its course; but the success of the story is in its depiction of young Charlie as an ethically responsible person, and in this respect “The Father-Thing,” like many of Dick’s other stories, mixes the fantastic and the ethically discursive. In fantasies, characters tend to be driven by the author’s desires and their own rather than agents; by asking the question, “what is to be done, what recourse is possible?” Dick is not only looking for ways to bring his stories to a close but is also challenging the process of fantasy.</p>
   <p>“The Father-Thing” and “Human Is” could be seen as counterparts, one treating an evil substitution, the other a benign one. Dick often works in this way; for instance, “The Defenders” (1:67−85) and <emphasis>The Penultimate Truth</emphasis> (1964) offer contrary versions of the situation in which the bulk of humanity is driven underground while others pretend that war still rages on the surface, though peace has long since resumed. In one the pretense is benign, in the other it is malign. This could be described as “dialectical” thinking, but there is never a synthesis or a point of productive contradiction. The fantasy could go either way, and this suggests both that fantasy is free and that actuality is frighteningly exposed to manipulation, because, in the long run, actuality is the creation of fantasy (and the political question is, “Whose fantasy?”).</p>
   <p>In “The Family and Authority” (1936), Max Horkheimer argues that the family tends to replicate the structure of authority that prevails in society as a whole and to serve as society’s way of imposing its norms on the growing individual (who, for instance, interprets the father’s power and money as reality, as how things are, and begins to learn to accept broader social arrangements as reality in the same way). But he also suggests that the family can sometimes protect its members or serve as source of solidarity against the rest of the world. It doesn’t necessarily operate as does the rest of society-by competition, by the notion that you are to be valued by Ihe amount of money, power, and success you have—but may try to live by love and cooperation. Many of Dick’s stories ask whether the family works to protect its members from the harsh inhuman pressures of the rest of society, or to impose on them the values which rationalize those pressures (“rationalize” in the psychological and the Weberian sense). This is why the stories often focus on fathers’ relationships with their sons and set the mother aside as a cipher. A militarist, aggressive society cannot reproduce itself unless the males who are to do the competing and fighting learn the appropriate values from their fathers. “The Father-Thing” is one of a series of stories exploring whether children will be destroyed by their parents, or their parents’ values, or will be able to save themselves (or, in the case of “Project Earth,” the human race itself): “The Cookie Lady,” “Tony and the Beetles,” “Jon’s World,” “A World of Talent,” “Foster, You’re Dead,” and “The Pre-Persons.”<a l:href="#n_65" type="note">[65]</a></p>
   <p>“Tony and the Beetles” and “Martians Come in Clouds” (1954) both begin with angry scenes between hard-boiled fathers and their young sons who, they fear, may be too soft; both culminate in the destruction of innocent nonhumans. In “Tony and the Beetles” (3:123−133), the father worries that Tony enjoys playing with the “beetles”, as they are chauvinistically called, offspring of an alien race which Terrans have subjugated in the interests of trading dominance (the correct name is “Pas-udeti”). When Tony persists nonetheless and, accompanied by his robot servant, visits the alien city as usual, he finds his beetle playmates have themselves become chauvinist and aggressive, encouraged by recent news of a victory over the Terrans. The upshot is not that Tony changes also; he is simply left bewildered for now; the upshot is that the other lifeform present, the robot servant, is cruelly dismembered by the aliens and so the third party seems more the victim than the innocent Tony.</p>
   <p>“Martians Come in Clouds” (2:119−127) begins with the father worrying if his son could cope should he encounter a “buggie.” Strange, apparently sentient but passive aliens have started floating to earth from outer space, and they, of course, must be exterminated as quickly as they are detected. The child does meet one, at dusk in a suburban street; the shapeless thing is helplessly caught in a tree. As he stands there, uncertainly, it communicates to him (telepathically, and so in a very intimate way) where it has come from and what it wants: It has drifted from Mars, from its ancient, played-out civilization on an arid, drying planet, and it wishes to make a home for its race over the oceans of the wet, abundant earth. Quite harmless. The child finally tears himself away and alerts the authorities; the buggie is burned where it hangs in the tree, and the boy becomes a hero. His father can boast about him at work.<a l:href="#n_66" type="note">[66]</a></p>
   <p>In these stories, then, fathers subject sons to brutal values, but the victim of the violence is some even more vulnerable third party, available only because of the SF setting. Again, it seems to me, what is suggested is not merely that the family is often built on and used to inculcate violence, but that the process is precarious. What if there is no alien, or no robot, on which to project the violence simmering between parent and child and yet needing to be inculcated? In these and similar stories, Dick imagines the delicacy and vulnerability of the alien, and thus the shamefulness of the violence done to it; so it is with the lynching of the Biltong by the frustrated consumers in “Pay for the Printer” and with the extraordinary scene in “Autofac” (1955) (4:1−20) in which a group of frustrated consumers lynch a messenger robot because they cannot convey to it their wishes-their wishes as the consumers the automated factories are blandly, undeviatingly “serving” and ignoring. In this last case the violence is understandable, but it seems all the more shameful for being directed against something that cannot really feel pain.</p>
   <p>In several other stories, what is tested is the other possibility that Horkheimer mentions, that the family will serve to protect its members against the values of the wider society rather than impose them. “Sales Pitch” (1954) (3:175−187) concerns a husband coming home from a hard day at the office and a hard commute (since people now commute to outer space) to face, with his wife, a robot, which gains entry in the foot-in-the-door manner of salesmen and is programmed to do all manner of jobs-programmed also to persist in demonstrating and otherwise selling itself until it is purchased. The robot, “almost seven feet high. Massive and solid” (179), makes mayhem, ripping things apart to show how it can repair them, blasting a tunnel into the ground in case of H-bomb attack, spraying, disinfecting, doing the husband’s taxes, sharpening his pencils, rewiring, remodeling.<a l:href="#n_67" type="note">[67]</a> The story, like the robot, is monomanically unsparing, careless of civility. The focus is on the intrusion and moronic coersion involved in advertising—the appliance not only sells itself, but announces that is designed to replace wife and husband, in the home, the car, and the office. The exasperated husband eventually flees beyond even the commuter belt, strains his rocket past its limits, and crashes into a star, still accompanied by the robot. This sense that there is a connection between the militarized, that is, aggressive or destructive side of society, and the consumerist side, which is often seen as merely bland and seductive, is well caught in these stories. If we are prepared to think of the home as the seat of human, kindly practices, since it is where children are commonly brought up and people commonly make love, then the world of the market is literally breaking down the walls.</p>
   <p>In “Nanny” (1955) (1:383−397), robot child carers become more and more formidable fighting machines, engaging each other in desperate combats in the parks whither they take their human charges; the process, which leaves the children anxious and the robots battered, is designed to blackmail concerned parents into buying ever more expensive models to replace those rendered vulnerably obsolescent. It is a trifle difficult to find a parallel in the actual history of child care to this Dickian extrapolation, so that it is better to turn the story around and see it as allegorizing the arms race—that is, making its brutal futility evident by placing it in the family, given that the protection of our children is among the rationalizations offered for the whole vast structure.</p>
   <p>The story that expresses this most successfully is “Foster, You’re Dead” (1955) (3:221−237).<a l:href="#n_68" type="note">[68]</a> In the world of this story, national defense has been privatized and devolved to the local community: It is agreed that each family should buy its own shelter, and each town finance its own self-defense screen. The main characters father has refused; he is right, and he serves as Dick’s mouthpiece in this. Since the shelters are never used, they are never tested, nor do they wear out; their “defects,” supposed to be due to advances in Soviet technology which render them insecure, are simply proclaimed by the manufacturers as they introduce dearer models.</p>
   <p>Foster’s insight is irrelevant in the face of his wife’s irritation and his son s misery. (So is the fact that Foster, a maker of old-fashioned wood furniture, is short of money.) The child is harassed at school, where fallout drill dominates the curriculum, and in his free hours he haunts the local shelter showroom, with its brash, genial salesmen on the model of car dealers. The father gives in; he buys his family the dearest and most elaborate shelter on the market, thereby rejoining society. The son, pathetically, takes the shelter as womb: “a little self-contained cosmos . . . faintly warm, completely friendly, like a living container.”</p>
   <p>“Foster, You’re Dead” gains a dimension from its focus on the child rather than the father or husband (as in “Sales Pitch” and “Nanny”); here the child is wholly a victim. The story expresses the harm done to the child by society’s double insistence that there is some fearful threat and that there is a sure refuge from that threat. The threat of the bomb (and thence of social humiliation and ostracism if one’s family opts out of bomb culture) comes to stand for all the threats the larger social world presents to a child, and the womb/shelter offers itself as solution. But when the model Foster has bought is outmoded by the latest Soviet advance and payments fall behind, the shelter is repossessed and the child is plunged into complete regressive neurosis. In the last scene he is torn, hunched and fetal, from the display shelter in the showroom where he has taken refuge.</p>
   <p>The implication of the story is again that consumerism (the notion that every social or personal activity is the province of selling) has the effect of displacing alternative power centers and centers of emotional stability. The fallout shelter replaces not only home, but mother (womb, source of nurture and reassurance) and father (source of authority and reassurance, as Foster’s father had tried to be) for the child. “There is no such thing as privacy . . . there are no private lives,” Dick told Paul Williams in 1974 <emphasis>(Only Apparently Real</emphasis> 157). Now there is no third party to suffer; the child is the one to suffer, and his suffering goes beyond physical damage.</p>
   <p>“Foster, You’re Dead” expresses the failure of the family to sustain the positive role Horkheimer envisages for it. Fathers fail to resist the pressures of the wider society, and, for Dick, it is fathers who count. In “The Pre-Persons” the only way in which the father can express what he knows to be right and try to help his child is by joining the children; an appropriately nonviolent, Gandhian gesture, whatever we think of the imagined circumstances in which it is made, but almost as close to futility as Foster’s father.</p>
   <p>Dick’s short stories mix bizarre fantasy and direct social criticism; they hybridize the literary form in which reality is amenable to the author’s imaginative play, and the literary form which is expected to reflect existing social conditions and may not only comment on them but prescribe solutions. I have suggested that in defending liberal and romantic values-freedom, imagination, the hope that the child or “little guy” can make a difference-Dick repeatedly sets his stories in the family and then suggests that both the family and the small town or suburban setting which is supposed to center on the family are permeable and unstable, no source of reliable value. In stories like “Breakfast at Twilight” and “The Hanging Stranger,” what is truly chilling is not that the ordinary human person and environment can be manipulated into inhumanity or into naturalizing evil conditions as normal, but that the ordinary human person and environment is not substantially “there” to be manipulated.</p>
   <p>But is not the imagination itself a locus of value? Surely we can find value in the author’s free creation of his story if it is not to be found in the characters or their actions. This is that zany or wonderfully surprising quality that draws many readers to Dick. In fact, stories like “Sales Pitch,” and “Foster, You’re Dead” renounce fantasy, however we define it. The refusal to be other than bluntly explicit is part of the literary effect. Nor is it possible to distinguish writer and things depicted. The stories curl back on their own shaping spirit. They are self-involved and self-critical.</p>
   <p>Two contrary stories will enable us to pursue the question of the duplicity of fantasy in Dick. In “Small Town” (1954) (2:341−353), a bitter, unsuccessful “little guy” pours all his spirit into the modeling of a miniature of his town in his basement, but as he does so he crosses the line between imitation (realism) and creation. He begins to modify and “improve” his model of the town. This development in the story is not yet fantasy, because the assumptions that shape his alterations are those of society in general, but the story metamorphoses into fantasy when the new model becomes the “actual” town, which then entraps the other characters (his wife and her lover). In “Exhibit Piece” (1954) (3:155−166), which is set in the future, the man responsible for curating a museum exhibit (a model) on the typical suburban family of the Eisenhower era devotes himself so fervently to his task that he starts to act as a 1950s person, wearing wide ties, adopting the appropriate slang. Then, when he steps into the exhibit, it becomes real, offering him a comfortable home and friendly family, all a distinct improvement on the drab totalitarian conditions of his present.</p>
   <p>The story gives us what “mainstream” fiction is often shy about: a sense that escape can be good. Let the reality principle go hang. But take “Small Town” and “Exhibit Piece” together as variations on an idea, and we have not a dialectic but an instability. In “Small Town” the wife’s lover analyzes the main characters inability to face reality and his regression to model building easily enough in pop Freudian terms, and then, when he sees what is going to happen, suggests that she and he simply let him regress into his model world—it will leave them free for their affair. He offers no realistic standpoint outside the fantastic terms of the story, so it is poetic justice that he and the wife, as well as the model builder, are absorbed into the model-become-town at the end. At the end of “Exhibit Piece” the main characters nasty colleagues, from whom he has so gratifyingly escaped, manage to put a 1950s newspaper across the gap he slipped through; it announces the discovery of a cobalt bomb and thus explains how the comparatively pleasant 1950s gave way to the grim future of the story’s present, bending time in a nonlinear fantastic way in the process. It all depends on who is doing the imagining—the main character with his wide ties and naive tricks of idiom, or those who came up with the cobalt bomb.</p>
   <p>Where does the author stand? In stories like “Sales Pitch,” he stands angrily outside the fiction, which he wields as a weapon, refusing the role of ingeniously extrapolating SF author; in stories like “Small Town,” he stands inside the fiction, since it is easy to see how his imagining is subject to the same traps as that of the characters. A sign of this is that it is easy to read “Small Town” or, for instance, “Pay for the Printer” as allegories of authorship (the author as creator of miniature worlds, or of “prints”).</p>
   <p>The question is one of politics (who has the power to impose their fantasy as reality), but Dick tends to treat it on the level of individual morality. Rather surprisingly for one who imagines wholesale transformations and subversions of reality, he suggests that the moral thing for the individual to do is to concentrate on the specific, the local, and present. We cannot know or control the whole, the whole is itself a fantasy, the more dangerous in that those who have dreamed it up, the powerful, do not acknowledge that it is a fantasy; we can only make sure that the next small step we take is a moral one. Emphasis is now on the gesture, the single action which may possibly be clever and moral enough for its insertion into the whole situation to, as it were, catch the whole situation off guard and make a difference.</p>
   <p>The problem Dick faced in writing his short stories was that of reconciling metaphysical openness, or relativity (whereby all is fantasy, not merely the shape of the story but the shape of the society the story treats, which is not offered to us as “reality” within the story), with political or ethical closure (whereby the story is a parable treating what has been done to us and what we should do, or value, in recourse). The problem is not solved in the stories; their pattern, if you try to trace it across a set of realizations, makes an instability not subject to dialectical analysis. The case is different with Dick’s novels of his best period (from <emphasis>Time Out of Joint,</emphasis> 1959, to A <emphasis>Scanner Darkly,</emphasis> 1977); with the most successful of these novels, the reader’s attention is held by a sort of calm serenity of treatment of very grim material, a treatment which renders considerations of recourse, of what scope the good man or woman has for virtuous gesture, secondary.</p>

   <p>6. By Lawrence Sutin and Gregg Rickman. It seems to me that Rickman’s biographical interpretations and psychoanalytical speculations highlight how difficult it is to interpret the stories by the life: we are left wondering why one whose life was apparently so painful and bizarre could have written stories which express insight into general social conditions. Either the whole society was to some degree unbalanced—which is distinctly plausible—or Dick’s particular history is of less importance to understanding his works than Rickman assumes. (Rickman himself bridges the gap between the mess of the life and the shapeliness of the stories by heartfelt but unhelpful invocation of Dick’s prophetic genius.)</p>
   <p>7. See the story notes contributed by Dick to <emphasis>The Golden Man;</emphasis> “An Open Letter to Joanna Russ,” <emphasis>Vertex,</emphasis> October, 1974, and the letters to Joanna Russ and Mike Bailey in <emphasis>The Selected Letters of Philip K. Dick: 1974</emphasis> (243, 258−59, 269).</p>
   <p>8. Elves: “The King of the Elves,” 1953; taxis: <emphasis>The Game-Players of Titan</emphasis> (1963) and <emphasis>The Unteleported Man,</emphasis> 1966 (later published <emphasis>as Lies, Inc.);</emphasis> dogs: “Roog,” 1953, and “Adjustment Team,” 1954; spiders: “Expendable,” 1953; shoes: “The Short Happy Life of the Brown Oxford,” 1954; Bach: “The Preserving Machine,” 1953.</p>
   <p>9. Other SF stories of the 1950s also treat the possibility that an alien existence can be inserted into quotidian American reality—for instance, Frederik Pohl’s “The Tunnel Under the World” (1955), A. J. Deutsch’s “A Subway Named Moebius” (1950), and Jack Finney’s “The Body-Snatchers” (1955); but in these cases there is a clear explanation.</p>
   <p>10. The version of the story published in French (1956) adds a final sentence to the effect that elsewhere another beast is crawling into a refuse dump to await its opportunity: The story is thus made circular, like “The Hanging Stranger” (Levack 95).</p>
   <p>11. Dates, when not already given, are “Project Earth,” 1953; “The Cookie Lady,” 1953; “Tony and the Beetles,” 1953; “Jon’s World,” 1954; “A World of Talent,” 1954; “Foster, You’re Dead,” 1955.</p>
   <p>12. The aliens, who drift to earth and wait passively where they have fallen, contrast strongly with the aggressive, purposeful humans in the story. This contrast is developed in <emphasis>The World Jones Made</emphasis> (1956): We have the “drifters,” alien entities who, when they randomly arrive on earth, are incinerated by mobs incited by Jones (lynch mobs, in metaphor); Jones is locked into linear purposiveness because of his power to predict the future—a sterile power, which renders him grim and miserable. The contrast between the random drifters and the linear Jones is varied in the final scenes on Venus, where the junction of a drifter and a “wad” reveals that the drifters were actually intergalactic pollen, relying on chance to bring about a conjunction with their complement and give birth to a complete organism. Here the contrast is between the drifters, whose nature is thus revealed, and the inhabitants of “the Refuge,” terrans laboriously mutated to adapt to life on Venus.</p>
   <p>13. Dick believed for a period in the mid-1970s that he was actually taken over by a personage from another time; this personage organized his life (even got him to file for income tax), in similar fashion, if benignly—a bizarre instance of the Dickian “dialectic.”</p>
   <p>14. When this was published in Russian (<emphasis>Ogonek</emphasis>, April 1958), “the author’s complimentary copy was destroyed by the U. S. Post Office as Communist propaganda” (Levack 96; Rickman doubts this anecdote [266]).</p>

    <p>To Flee from Dionysus: </p>
    <p>Enthousiasmos from “Upon the Dull Earth” to VALIS</p>
    <p>by Samuel J. Umland</p>
   </title>
   <p>During an interview with Paul Williams in late 1974, which was later incorporated into Williams’s book <emphasis>Only Apparently Real,</emphasis> Philip Dick said (163):</p>
   <cite>
    <p>The way I feel is that the universe itself is actually alive, and we’re in it as part of it. And it is like a breathing creature, which explains the concept of the Atman, you know, the breath, pneuma, the breath of God . . . that the universe sort of breathes . . . everything is moving, changing, growing, developing, and that we move with it. We can never escape this movement . . . . Like Jonah, trying to get away from the whale. “Trying to get away from the whale!” Trying to get away from God. . . . He was swall[ow]ed by God.</p>
   </cite>
   <p>At approximately the same time as he made these remarks, in an <emphasis>Exegesis</emphasis> entry written circa 1974−1975, Dick was considering as a plot device for a proposed novel an ideograph which was to be called “the Albemuth whale’s mouth sign,” consisting of a toothed open (whale’s) mouth, inside of which was the Christian fish sign.<a l:href="#n_69" type="note">[69]</a> Because Dick’s notes represent his preliminary sketches for a novel and are not, therefore, fully developed, they tantalize rather more than they satisfy; however, the religious symbolism of the ideograph is significant and perhaps can be ascertained by referring to a bit of whale lore about which Dick himself must have known. That is, “the Albemuth whale’s mouth sign” gains a certain resonance when not simply decoded by reference to the story of Jonah and the Whale alone, though that story is certainly intertextually connected.</p>
   <p>In the “Extracts (supplied by a sub-sub-librarian),” the section of whale lore which precedes the actual narrative of Melville’s <emphasis>Moby-Dick,</emphasis> there is a brief excerpt from Montaigne’s <emphasis>Apology for Raimond Sebond,</emphasis> concerning a rather remarkable relationship of cooperation between the whale and the sea gudgeon.</p>
   <p>The excerpt is so provocative that Dick may have been compelled to track down the entire passage, which would have been readily available in one of the many editions of Montaigne’s <emphasis>Essays.</emphasis> I reproduce the passage here (472):</p>
   <cite>
    <p>It is said that the whale never goes abroad without being preceded by a small fish resembling the sea-gudgeon, which is for that reason called the Guide. The whale follows it, allowing itself to be turned and led as easily as a vessel is turned by its rudder; and in return for this service, whilst every other thing, whether animal or vessel, that enters the awful chasm of this monster’s mouth is forthwith engulfed and lost, this little fish retires into it in all security, and sleeps there. During its sleep the whale never stirs, but as soon as it issues forth, starts and follows it unceasingly; and if by chance the guide goes astray, the whale will go wandering about hither and thither, often knocking itself against the rocks, like a ship without a rudder.</p>
    <text-author>(<emphasis>Montaigne</emphasis> 1927)</text-author>

   <p>The allegorical potential of this phenomenon would not have been lost on Dick’s active imagination. As a result of the added significance of Montaigne’s parable, we can read the peculiar ideograph of “the Albemuth whale’s mouth sign” as containing more meaning than is possible by reference to the story of Jonah and the Whale alone. As a tentative interpretation, I propose that the ideograph allegorically represents God, incarnated as Leviathan, which is not precisely “swallowing,” but holding—one is tempted to say protectively harboring—in his mouth the votaries of Christ, the Christians. In this case, the Christians are rather like Dick’s imagined Elijah, or John the Baptist, the prophet who precedes the coming of, and announces to the world, God’s immanence. The ideograph was conceived in those crucial months following the religious events of “2−3−74,“ and the plot outlines and story sketches among which it appears became parts of both <emphasis>Radio Free Albemuth</emphasis> (1976; published 1985) and <emphasis>VALIS</emphasis> (1981), books based on Dick’s profound religious experiences of 1974.<a l:href="#n_70" type="note">[70]</a> I will have occasion to return to this ideograph later in this chapter.</p>
   <p>In the <emphasis>Exegesis</emphasis> entries consisting of interpretations of his own novels, Dick wrote, <emphasis>“VALIS</emphasis> deals with the irreducible primary religious sense: God as terrifying &amp; fascinating simultaneously”(<emphasis>Exegesis</emphasis> 201). What Dick identifies here as “the irreducible primary religious sense” is remarkably similar to what Rudolph Otto, in <emphasis>The Idea of the Holy</emphasis> (1923), calls the “numinous” experience, the experiencing of the divine as both “terrifying &amp; fascinating,” to use Dick’s phrase. Otto identifies the “numinous” experience with the “horror of Pan” (14), and describes its main features as follows (31):</p>
   <cite>
    <p>The daemonic-divine object may appear to the mind an object of horror and dread, but at the same time it is no less something that allures with a potent charm, and the creature, who trembles before it, utterly cowed and cast down, has always at the same time the impulse to turn to it, nay even to make it somehow his own. The “mystery” is for him not merely something to be wondered at but something that entrances him; and beside that in it which bewilders and confounds, he feels something that captivates and transports him with a strange ravishment, rising often enough to the pitch of dizzy intoxication; it is the Dionysiac-element in the numen.</p>
   </cite>
   <p>In the novel <emphasis>VALIS,</emphasis> Dick (or rather, Horselover Fat) observes that the relationship with the divine “is a kind of terrible game” which “can go either way” (§11.164), because “the divine and the terrible are so close to each other” (§11.165). He also claims that “there is a streak of the irrational in the universe, and we, the little hopeful trusting Rhipidon Society, may have been drawn into it, to perish” (§11.164; see also §3.31). The “streak of the irrational” is here conceived of as an ontological metaphor; that is, it imagines a mental state or condition as a container, like a room, into which one can be “drawn”—like the mouth of the beast, Leviathan. A Dickian theophany, or manifestation of the numen, contains what Otto characterizes as the “Dionysiac-element,” what R. D. Stock, in <emphasis>The Flutes of Dionysus,</emphasis> describes as a “blend of desire and cruelty” (10)<a l:href="#n_71" type="note">[71]</a>, and what Northrop Frye calls the dimension “of malice within the divine nature” (quoted in Stock 48). This experience is concretized in the ideograph Dick called “the Albemuth whale’s mouth sign,” the precarious existence of life inside the awesome mouth of the giant Leviathan, the mouth of God. The numen contains equal portions of the gentle, loving Redeemer of the New Testament and the wrathful, demonic violence of the Yahweh of the Book of Job (see <emphasis>VALIS,</emphasis> §2.17 and §3.23).</p>
   <p>Dionysus is the God of masks, disguises, and transformations and manifests himself in Dick’s writings in both benevolent and malevolent incarnations. Benevolent manifestations are named Valis, Zebra, Tagore, and, of course, Christ; malevolent incarnations Dick names in the <emphasis>Exegesis</emphasis> the “master magician,” Pigspurt,<a l:href="#n_72" type="note">[72]</a> James-James, Yaldabaoth; and Satan or Belial in <emphasis>The Divine Invasion</emphasis> (1981). The demonic “Dionysus-element” in Dick’s fiction emerges again and again and is consistently expressed in various guises, from his earliest work to his last. The demonic is imagined as both mad Gnostic demiurge and as an invading alien (e.g., Palmer Eldritch); in this sense, the theological preoccupations, however unorthodox, remained remarkably stable over the three decades marked by his writing.</p>
   <p>It is a commonplace of banal proportions that in the modern era the “Dionysiac-element” was relegated to the vast realm of the unconscious in the human psyche and that, as Camille Paglia observes, “selfhood expands to include the unconscious” (<emphasis>Sexual Personae</emphasis> 85). Hence, at the most general level of approximation, Dick tended to follow the line of thought about the Dionysian that derived from Nietzsche. The “Apollonian and the Dionysian” name the dualistic, antagonistic forces within the human unconscious (see <emphasis>VALIS,</emphasis> §11.173). If the Apollonian names the firm faith in the <emphasis>principium individuationis,</emphasis> the Dionysian identifies the collapse of this faith. In analogies drawn from music, Nietzsche’s description of the Dionysian experience would have especially appealed to Dick:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>Transform Beethoven’s “Hymn to Joy” into a painting; let your imagination conceive the multitudes bowing to the dust, awestruck—then you will approach the Dionysian. Now the slave is a free man; now all the rigid, hostile barriers that necessity, caprice, or “impudent convention” have fixed between man and man arc broken. Now, with the gospel of universal harmony, each one feels himself not only united, reconciled, and fused with his neighbor, but as one with him, as if the veil of <emphasis>maya</emphasis> had been torn aside and were now merely fluttering in tatters before the mysterious primordial unity.</p>
    <text-author>(<emphasis>Basic Writings of Nietzsche</emphasis> 37)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>The Dionysian moment of “mystical self-abnegation” (38) dissolves the boundaries separating Self and Other, and in a moment of keen perceptual insight or epiphany, the human being recognizes his true being as a member of a species and that cthonic nature does not care whatsoever for individuals.</p>
   <p>Following Jung’s reading of Nietzsche, <a l:href="#n_73" type="note">[73]</a> Dick conceived of a person’s public personality as a “mask,” and he followed Jung in imagining the unconscious as both “hermaphroditic” (Paglia 85) and as the repository of the cthonic archetypes, archetypes understood as autonomous personalities that reside in the unconscious:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>An irruption from the collective unconscious, Jung taught, can wipe out the fragile individual ego. In the depths of the collective the archetypes slumber; if aroused, they can heal or they can destroy. This is the danger of the archetypes; the opposite qualities are not yet separated. Bipolarization into paired opposites does not occur until consciousness occurs.</p>
    <text-author>(<emphasis>VALIS</emphasis> §10.164)<a l:href="#n_74" type="note">[74]</a></text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>Dick’s language in this passage is virtually indistinguishable from that he uses when discussing the numen; I will remind the reader of the passage from <emphasis>VALIS</emphasis> I cited earlier, in which the relationship with the divine is a “terrible game” which “can go either way.” Here, “the archetypes,” like the numen, are also dualistic, embodying both the benign, Apollonian element and the “Dionysiac-element”; the archetypes, like the numen, can either “heal” or “destroy.” We are back in the mouth of Leviathan. Moreover, the passage indicates that as Dick read Jung, there is no prelapsarian state of grace which preceded consciousness; in the words of Lao-Tze of which Jung was so fond, “High rests on low”—in this case, the Dionysian, primordial archetypes that are the inheritance of each individual psyche (in <emphasis>VALIS</emphasis> [§3.31] Dick refers to <emphasis>Fragment 54</emphasis> of Heraclitus, “Latent structure is master of obvious structure”). Yet, as the aforementioned passage indicates, Dick imagines a movement from an original ontological duality to a Hegelian notion of an evolving, teleologically driven order. At the level of personal psychology, this suggests that Dick reads Jungian individuation as the elevation and integration into consciousness of the shadow archetype.</p>
   <p>Dick develops this reading early, but it does not yet appear in any coherent form in one of his earliest works, <emphasis>The Cosmic Puppets</emphasis> (completed mid-1953, published in novel form in 1957). Dick abjured the Judeo-Christian duality of God/Satan and chose to depict the Zoroastrian Ormazd/Ahriman duality restored to its proper dynamic tension. The dualistic cosmologies available from Zoroastrianism, Manicheanism, and Gnosticism were too static, however, because the conflicts implicit in all of these ancient dualisms are simply resolved by an overcoming of the Dark by the Light, reflecting a comedic narrative structure which is always predetermined in advance and hence tiresomely predictable. Thus this static model was quickly forgone in his early texts, as he proceeded to develop his religious and philosophic thought.</p>
   <p>During an interview with Charles Platt, later incorporated into Platt’s <emphasis>Dream Makers,</emphasis> Dick said (154),</p>
   <cite>
    <p>I forged a concept which is relatively simple and possibly unique in theology, and that is, the <emphasis>irrational</emphasis> is the primordial stratum of the universe, it comes first and is primary in ontology . . . . And it evolves into rationality. The history of the universe is a movement from irrationality—chaos, cruelty, blindness, pointlessness—to a rational structure which is harmonious, interlinked in a way which is orderly and beautiful.</p>
   </cite>
   <p>The “irrational . . . primordial stratum” Dick here identifies I am calling the “Dionysiac-element” in his fiction, and it is shown most clearly in operation in a text written early in his career, the short story “Upon the Dull Earth” (1953). It is not one of Dick’s well-known stories and perhaps not one of his best given its nebulous supernaturalism, but I will argue that it is in fact one of the more significant in terms of its rather ominous yoking together of the principle of the “Dionysiac-element” and the Pythagorean notion of transmigration, the migration of the soul.</p>
   <p>Completed late in 1953, after <emphasis>The Cosmic Puppets,</emphasis> “Upon the Dull Earth” was first published in <emphasis>Beyond Fantasy Fiction</emphasis> (November, 1954) and included in <emphasis>A Handful of Darkness,</emphasis> the collection consisting mostly of Dick’s early, dark fantasies first published in Britain in 1955.<a l:href="#n_75" type="note">[75]</a> The story then remained more or less unavailable for many years until it was reprinted in <emphasis>The Preserving Machine</emphasis> (1969).<a l:href="#n_76" type="note">[76]</a> After that collection went out of print, the story did not appear again until <emphasis>The Collected Stories</emphasis> appeared (1987) (3:203−220). As a story, it uncomfortably straddles the genres of occult fantasy and ontological horror story, a rather awkward combination of Arthur Machen and Franz Kafka, and it bears a close resemblance to both Poe’s “Ligeia” and, more importantly, to Dostoevsky’s “The Double.” Characterisically, the story contains Dick’s hybrid allusions to both Classical and Judeo-Christian sources, as well as to occult and esoteric religious thought.</p>
   <p>The title of the story comes from a line in a song from Shakespeare’s <emphasis>Two Gentlemen of Verona</emphasis> (IV, ii; 39−53), as does the female protagonist’s name:</p>
   <poem>
    <stanza>
     <v>Who is Silvia? What is she,</v>
     <v>That all our swains commend her?</v>
     <v>Holy, fair, and wise is she;</v>
     <v>The heaven such grace did lend her,</v>
     <v>That she might admiréd be.</v>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
     <v>Is she kind as she is fair?</v>
     <v>For beauty lives with kindness.</v>
     <v>Love doth to her eyes repair,</v>
     <v>To help him of his blindness</v>
     <v>And, being helped, inhabits there.</v>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
     <v>Then to Silvia let us sing,</v>
     <v>That Silvia is excelling.</v>
     <v>She excels each mortal thing</v>
     <v>Upon the dull earth dwelling.</v>
     <v>To her let us garlands bring.</v>
    </stanza>
    <text-author>(<emphasis>Complete Works</emphasis> 138)</text-author>
   </poem>
   <p>From the title of the story, one can infer that Dick imagined Silvia as a highly idealized love object. In his discussion of this Shakespearian song, Cleanth Brooks observed in his essay “Irony as a Principle of Structure” that Silvia is “something of an angel and something of a goddess” (971) and it is most likely this idealization of the feminine that attracted Dick to its sentiment “Upon the Dull Earth” concerns Rick and his fiancé Silvia, who Rick accuses of being a “witch” (3:203), a description she vehemently denies. As the story begins, Silvia has led Rick to a secluded spot where she has made a (lamb’s) blood offering to the “white-winged giants,” angelic incarnations, at least Silvia believes, of her “ancestors” (205), which are lured forth by the blood. Alluding to <emphasis>The Odyssey,</emphasis> Silvia likens her act to Ulysses summoning the shades “from the nether world” (205). There is a hint of danger in the ritual, however, because the shades seem to be desirous of taking Silvia with them. Only Rick’s presence of mind prevents her from being seared to ash by the white shades.</p>
   <p>Disturbed by her perverse obsession with the shades, Rick plans to destroy the refrigeration equipment which preserves the blood for Silvia’s offerings. During his attempt, Silvia confronts him, and during their ensuing argument she accidentally cuts herself. Unable to help themselves, the angels descend on her, blasting her body with their heat and leaving it “a brittle burned-out husk” (209). Following the holocaust, Rick attempts to summon Silvia from beyond the grave—to resurrect her, as it were. He obtains steer blood “from a New Jersey abbattoir” (209) in order to attract the shades. The offering works, but apparently the shades are reluctant to return Silvia from the other side, because Silvia’s body—“the clay part” (211)—has been destroyed. In effect, there is nothing for her to come back to, no body. In order to return, Silvia’s spirit would have “to mold something,” to usurp “something of clay” (212), a dangerous and unusual procedure. Nonetheless, the obsessed Rick <emphasis>“had to have her back”</emphasis> (212; Dick’s emphasis). His demand is followed by a “deafening crack of heat” and he finds himself lifted up and “tossed into a flaming sea of pure energy” (212). Like Orpheus losing Eurydice for the second time, Rick briefly glimpses Silvia, “her hands reaching imploringly towards him” (213) before she slips away. He momentarily loses consciousness.</p>
   <p>Rescued by Silvia’s father, he regains his senses in Silvia’s parents’ living room, where he is initially unsure of precisely what happened. He is berated by Silvia’s sister, Betty Lou, for his impetuous attempt to bring Silvia back from the <emphasis>post mortem</emphasis> world. In the middle of the argument, however, a startling change abruptly comes over her (214):</p>
   <cite>
    <p>The change came without warning. Like a film gone dead, Betty Lou froze, her mouth half open, one arm raised, her words dead on her tongue. She was suspended, an instantly lifeless thing raised off the floor, as if caught between two slides of glass. A vacant insect, without speech or sound, inert and hollow. Not dead, but abruptly thinned back to primordial inanimacy. Into the captured shell filtered new potency and being. It settled over her, a rainbow of life that poured into place eagerly-like hot fluid-into every part of her.</p>
   </cite>
   <p>Silvia has thus “come across” from “the other side.” She has transmigrated from the land of the dead, from the undiscovered country, and taken over Betty Lou’s body, infused or inspired the body with her own spirit. But there is something wrong in this metempsychosis. Silvia warns, “ ‘they took a living form, didn’t they? Not discarded clay. They don’t have the power, Rick. They altered His work instead’ “ (214). In quick succession, the remaining members of Silvia’s family grotesquely metamorphosize into Silvia, becoming “identical, pure repetitions” of her (216).<a l:href="#n_77" type="note">[77]</a></p>
   <p>Rick flees from (the) Silvia(s) in a panicked flight; fearing that she is going to “take him over,” he runs, he tries to escape, to flee in his automobile, but he cannot: Wherever he turns, wherever he tries to run, she appears before him. Succumbing to the pursuit, realizing that flight is futile, Rick returns home to his apartment.</p>
   <p>Already his apartment seems strange and unfamiliar; the bathroom is “a difficult place to find” (220). Standing before the mirror, Rick stands transfixed by the strangeness of his own reflection, in a sort of <emphasis>signe du miroir,</emphasis> and watches himself metamorphosize into Silvia’s form, losing his identity and personality. The story concludes with Silvia sitting alone on a living room chair, pleading with the nonexistent Rick to try to help her.</p>
   <p>A crucial point about “Upon the Dull Earth” must be understood at the outset for it to make any sense, and this is that it appears to be the story of a transgression of a taboo—though what the taboo might be is not immediately clear. Even if the taboo theory is ultimately unjustifiable, this impression is so strong that the problem must be carefully analyzed.</p>
   <p>Another consideration, which eludes the strictures of criticism as such by appealing to biography, is the putative identity of the female protagonist, Silvia, for Dick. According to Patricia S. Warrick in <emphasis>Mind in Motion</emphasis> Silvia is Jane, Dick’s twin sister who died in infancy. Dick was “forever tormented by the loss of that twin sister who died in infancy. He first captured the image of this ghost buried in his psyche in a very early story, ‘Upon the Dull Earth’ (1954)” (131). Within that same discussion, Warrick also observes that there is a “melancholy theme of the loss of a female” which “haunts the pages” of many of his novels (131). In 1982, Dick told Gregg Rickman, “if there can be said to be a tragic theme running through my life, it’s the death of my twin sister and the re-enactment of this again and again . . . . My psychological problems are traceable to the loss of my sister” <emphasis>(The Last Testament</emphasis> 93). Late in his life Dick was still preoccupied with this theme, speculating in the <emphasis>Exegesis</emphasis> about the identity of the Valis mind (246): “It is female. It is on the other side—the <emphasis>post mortem</emphasis> world. It has been with me all my life. It is my twin sister Jane. This was referred to in one dream, &amp; that is enough. ‘Specifically, fairies are the dead.’ Two clues . . . . The other psyche I carry inside me is that of my dead sister.”</p>
   <p>According to the definitions imposed by this reading, “Upon the Dull Earth” expresses the felt need of the Self to repair the wound and reunite with its separated female half, its <emphasis>anima,</emphasis> and re-form the divine syzygy—though why this attempt should end in the catastrophe depicted in the story is not immediately clear. The problem is that this task of re-formation can only be accomplished in two ways: by passing over into death oneself, perhaps by suicide, or by magically resurrecting the dead loved one.</p>
   <p>It is the second possibility, that of resurrection, which suggests an orthodox theological interpretation of the taboo that I referred to earlier. The resurrection of the dead is God’s sovereign prerogative as revealed in the books of Daniel and Revelation. When some mere mortal seizes this life-giving power for himself, he must suffer the consequences. The golem runs amok, destroying the village; Frankenstein’s monster haunts the countryside, committing mayhem; the Sorcerer’s Apprentice forgets how to reverse his master’s spell-this last, in particular, an obvious (perhaps too obvious) parallel for the situation depicted in “Upon the Dull Earth.” Rick wants Silvia back and gets more of her than he’d bargained for: She becomes an invader, an invading nightmare, a metastastizing cancer of the spirit that eventually annihilates all differences, including—most importantly—that of his own consciousness and identity. Rick would appear to have broken the second and third of the Mosaic commandments, which proscribe idolatry and usurpation. He has made an idol of his lost fiancé, like the golden calf, and then compounded his sin by taking upon himself God’s sovereign authority to restore her to life.</p>
   <p>The problem with this interpretation, unfortunately, is that Dick’s own text forbids it. (Even if this were not so, our knowledge of all of his other work would forbid it.) The universe in which “Upon the Dull Earth” takes place is not a recognizably Christian one but a Gnostic, perhaps Neoplatonic variant: The Creator of the World has already disappeared from it, following his own quest upward through the rings of emanations of the Pleroma (3:212), and is not around to exact any penalties. So why is Rick made to suffer this nightmare?</p>
   <p>The best one can offer is that he has broken the psychological equivalents of these religious taboos against usurpation and idolatry; his suffering then becomes an unfolding of psychic fate or necessity. The revenant Silvia would thus roughly correspond to what Jeffrey Burton Russell, in <emphasis>The Devil</emphasis>, calls the “Alastor,” a minor Greek spirit which was like an “avenging ghost” that “both tempts us to sin and then punishes us” (143).</p>
   <p>But is even this a plausible interpretation of the taboo? The presence of Gnostic elements in the text suggests another possibility. At one point, Silvia asks Rick, ‘“Do you want me to be chained here? I have to go on-I’m through with this part of the journey . . . . You want to be a worm always. A fuzzy, little creeping caterpillar’” (207). By luring Silvia back to him from death, Rick has seemingly committed the sin-transgressed against the Gnostic taboo-of harnessing the higher to the lower, of compelling the descent of the enlightened spirit <emphasis>(nous, pneuma)</emphasis> into gross matter in a false metempsychosis or reincarnation. For his obsessed presumption Rick is made to suffer.</p>
   <p>This interpretation cannot be sustained either, at least not in its theological form. Silvia has been taken, as the text indicates, “too soon” (211); her death is not a return of the pneumatic spirit to the godhead, but a new captivity: “‘It was their fault. You don’t blame me, do you? They know they did the wrong thing. Those who did it have been punished, but that doesn’t help me’” (211). The beings who have taken her are in no sense more evolved spiritually than she or any human being is, though they have deceived Silvia into believing they are. In the beginning <emphasis>they</emphasis> are depicted as bright, white angels, these ghosts of her ancestors, but later they seem more like the Archons of Darkness. The text metaphorically compares them to hungry insects-tellingly to bluebottle flies (206), thus suggesting a connection to Saklas or Beelzebub (Lord of the Flies), whose false-creation would mimic that of the originating Deity yet fail at the imitation. The Fallen Angel cannot create teeming life from clay by breathing into it his own being as God can, but can only blasphemously replicate dibbuks: “‘But they took a living form, didn’t they? Not discarded clay. They don’t have the power, Rick. They altered His work instead’” (214).</p>
   <p>There is no doubt that the spirits which take Silvia are fallen ones rather than risen ones. The symbolic action of their drinking of blood implicitly reveals their condition, since Silvia is made to stand to them in the same relationship that Christ stands to fallen humankind. Significantly, the shades first drink the blood of a lamb, and then feast upon hers in Dick’s characteristic inversion of the Eucharistic sacrament (I will shortly look at a late variant of this inversion, “Rautavaara’s Case”). Indeed, Silvia refers to herself as a “saint” (205) for her blood sacrifice, the <emphasis>imitatio Christi.</emphasis> In this uncanny ritualistic sparagmos,<a l:href="#n_78" type="note">[78]</a> the relationship of ancestor to descendant in Silvia’s family line is revealed as a relationship of predation: The revenant ancestors feed off the blood of the descendants. (I will examine this relationship of violence shortly.)</p>
   <p>The crucial scene of the story is the last one, a catastrophe or cataclysmic apocalypse in which Rick’s very consciousness and identity is erased by the invading, or rather transmigrating, spirit of Silvia. In the broadest sense, it is a Dionysian moment of loss of self, the collapse of the <emphasis>principium individuationis.</emphasis> A Jungian approach, which would read the ending as a kind of infantile regression to the cthonic archetypes so common in early twentieth-century theories of schizophrenia (which Jung, among others, hypothesized, and Dick drew on), fails to account for the story’s catastrophe or cataclysm. The onset of Rick’s amnesia, and his infantile regression, would be similar to that of Ragle Gumm in <emphasis>Time Out of Joint</emphasis> (1959), in which Gumm’s “withdrawal psychosis” (§14.165) results in his retreat to the world of his infancy. Gumm’s “retreat fantasy”(§14.165), in turn, is similar to John Cupertino’s in “Retreat Syndrome” (1963) (5:67−85), in which Cupertino is told that due to stress and guilt he “withdrew psychologically” into a “fantasy world” (5:82). And in <emphasis>We Can Build You,</emphasis> Louis Rosen claims that an attack of schizophrenia is “a weakening of attention” which allows “unconscious processes” to gain mastery over the individual. The attacks capture “very archaic processes, archetypal,” that “non-schizophrenics haven’t had since the age of five” (§17.189).</p>
   <p>Yet neither explanation, that of the Dionysian loss of the individual self or the schizophrenic regression hypothesis, accounts in any satisfactory way for the way the action moves ineluctably toward the final catastrophe, the endless multiplication of identical Silvias throughout the world, an apocalypse consisting of utter ontological collapse. Moreover, if these interpretive explanations fail to account satisfactorily for the concluding action of “Upon the Dull Earth,” then the explanations will surely fail when one recognizes that “Upon the Dull Earth” employs precisely the same catastrophe as <emphasis>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</emphasis> (1965). In that novel’s concluding action, Palmer Eldritch begins to duplicate himself in his victims, taking over their consciousness and identity precisely as Silvia does. (Though, to be sure, “Upon the Dull Earth” is about the fear of separation; <emphasis>Three Stigmata</emphasis> about the fear of entrapment.)<a l:href="#n_79" type="note">[79]</a></p>
   <p>The crucial question can be reformulated as follows: Why should the return of the love object from death and the dread object from deep space lead to the same nightmare of an invading spirit that annihilates consciousness and identity? For Dick, the Dionysian loss of Self entails not simply a confusion in the subject as to his identity, but the experience of an infusion of a transmigrating or invading agent or agency that corresponds to what has been known since the Greeks as possession,<a l:href="#n_80" type="note">[80]</a> and it is this concept that can account for the similarities between the stories. The phenomenon, as it appears in Dick’s writing, demands to be thoroughly explored.</p>
   <p>In both “Upon the Dull Earth” and <emphasis>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</emphasis>, the subject (Rick, Leo Bulero) falls prey to the psychic disturbance that René Girard, in <emphasis>Violence and the Sacred,</emphasis> names “Dionysian vertigo,” where the subject has “double vision” or sees double.<a l:href="#n_81" type="note">[81]</a> Silvia returns from death both human and nonhuman, while a human being named Palmer Eldritch returns from the wastes between the stars in a similar condition. Moreover, he has the three stigmata consisting of artificial eyes and arm, and stainless steel teeth (the latter hyperboiically suggesting both predation and the Leviathan’s mouth). Both Palmer Eldritch and Silvia thus correspond to what Girard names the “monstrous double,” a being both human and not human, containing a duality that is always “an attribute of monsters” (162). What the subject perceives in the “monstrous double” is both self and nonself, the familiar and not familiar, something containing both the <emphasis>déja vu</emphasis> and <emphasis>jamais vu.</emphasis></p>
   <p>The phenomenological features of the subject’s vertiginous encounter with the “monstrous double” correspond remarkably to what Louis A. Sass, in <emphasis>Madness and Modernism,</emphasis> describes as the representative symptoms of the schizophrenic <emphasis>Stimmung</emphasis>,<a l:href="#n_82" type="note">[82]</a> the onset of a schizophrenic episode.<a l:href="#n_83" type="note">[83]</a> The structural features of the <emphasis>Stimmung</emphasis> consist of what he names “the <emphasis>Trema</emphasis> [analogous to stage fright] whose three aspects are Unreality, Mere Being, and Fragmentation, and the Apophany,” which often occurs slightly later and precedes the psychotic break (52). Sass summarizes the phenomenological features as follows (52):</p>
   <cite>
    <p>Once conventional meanings have faded away (Unreality) and new details or aspects of the world have been thrust into awareness (Fragmentation, Mere Being), there often emerges an inchoate sense of the as yet unarticulated significances of these newly emergent phenomena. In this “mood” . . . the reality of everything the patient notices can seem heightened, as if each object were, somehow, being hyperboiically itself; and this in turn can create an air of unavoidable specificity, or a feeling of inevitability that hovers about everything. Alternatively, things may take on an exemplary quality, as if they represented other objects or essences, existing not as themselves but as tokens of types lying elsewhere (in such instances visible objects can appear very precise and very unreal at the same time).<a l:href="#n_84" type="note">[84]</a></p>
   </cite>
   <p>It is this sense of objects stripped of their usual significance, so that they are both, or rather simultaneously, familar and unfamiliar, with the result that the world is both the same and yet not the same, which corresponds so clearly with Girard’s description of the “monstrous double.” The fashionable Freudian term for this experience is <emphasis>unheimlich,</emphasis> translated as “the uncanny” in Freud’s essay (1919) of the same name. What returns to itself must have once become estranged from itself, lost from itself, and the movement is a restoration of a lost order, specifically a re-membering or anamnesis. At this point, we should recall the <emphasis>sparagmos</emphasis> or dis-memberment of Dionysus, who is re-membered in <emphasis>The Bacchae</emphasis> even as his usurper, Pentheus, is sacrificed in his place. As Girard observes, a short time before Pentheus is murdered he sees double, cementing the similarity between the sacrificial victims. (For Dick’s comments on Pentheus and <emphasis>The Bacchae,</emphasis> see the <emphasis>Exegesis</emphasis> 42−43; 150−51; 192−93; 218−20.)</p>
   <p>Both the action of “Upon the Dull Earth” and that of <emphasis>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</emphasis> move inexorably towards a catastrophe of Dionysian vertigo or schizophrenic <emphasis>Stimmung,</emphasis> the subject’s confrontation with a world being invaded by the monstrous double. Just as Silvia invades, so too does the more overtly sinister Palmer Eldritch, overcoming and possessing (metaphorically, devouring) all those mortals standing in their paths.<a l:href="#n_85" type="note">[85]</a> Girard describes the process as follows (165):</p>
   <cite>
    <p>The subject watches the monstrosity that takes shape within him and outside him simultaneously.<a l:href="#n_86" type="note">[86]</a> In his efforts to explain what is happening to him, he attributes the origin of the apparition to some exterior cause. Surely, he thinks, this vision is too bizarre to emanate from the familiar country within, too foreign in fact to derive from the world of men. The whole interpretation of the experience is dominated by the sense that the monster is alien to himself.</p>
    <p>The subject feels that the most intimate regions of his being have been invaded by a supernatural creature who also besieges him without. Horrified, he finds himself the victim of a double assault to which he cannot respond . . . . This extraordinary freedom of movement permits the god—or spirit or demon—to seize souls at will. The condition called “possession” is in fact but one particular interpretation of the monstrous double.</p>
   </cite>
   <p>A more precise description of the features of the “Dionysiac-element” within the Dickian numen is now possible. The Dionysian moment in Dick’s fiction is not simply the subject’s loss of self-integrity or the dissolution of ego boundaries. Rather, it begins with either separation or entrapment, leading to the initial identity confusion and onset of panic (what Sass calls the <emphasis>Trema),</emphasis> followed by a (panic-induced) flight or escape which only inexorably leads to its unavoidable catastrophe, an entrapment which consists of a slip into amnesia with the final assault, the infusion of an alien presence, the possession. Identity is subsumed by the monstrous double.</p>
   <p>To experience the Dionysian is to experience insanity, Dick claims in <emphasis>VALIS</emphasis> (§3.31; §10.166). The Dionysian experience is that of being “swallowed by God” as Dick hyperbolically states, to be devoured by Leviathan. He called this, in <emphasis>VALIS</emphasis> and elsewhere, <emphasis>enthousiasmos,</emphasis> which, for him, more often that not means to be possessed by the “insane” god Dionysus.<a l:href="#n_87" type="note">[87]</a> I must return once more to <emphasis>VALIS,</emphasis> the text in which Dick describes the experience in its most pristine form (§10.165−66):</p>
   <cite>
    <p>God can be good and terrible-not in succession—but at the same time. . . . The gentle sounds of the choir singing “Amen, amen” are not to calm the congregation but to pacify the god. When you know this you have penetrated to the innermost core of religion. And the worst part is that the god can thrust himself outward and into the congregation until he becomes them. You worship a god and then he pays you back by taking you over. This is called <emphasis>“enthousiasmos”</emphasis> in Greek, literally “to be possessed by the god.” Of all the Greek gods the one most likely to do this was Dionysus. And, unfortunately, Dionysus was insane. . . . If you . . . try to run . . . he has you anyhow, for the demigod Pan was the basis of panic which is the uncontrollable urge to flee. . . . So in trying to flee from Dionysus you are taken over anyhow.</p>
   </cite>
   <p>Dick never ceased to invoke this experience, even obsessively returning to it in a late story, “Rautavaara’s Case” (1980) (5:375−383).</p>
   <p>In this story, a young, female technician from Finland, Agneta Rautavaara, is being transported to a planet in suspended animation. The life-support equipment has malfunctioned, and her associates, also in suspended animation, have died. Though she has suffered brain damage, technicians in communication with the ship manage to stabilize her condition. While they ponder her rescue, they decide to allow her to undergo fugue states. In one of the fugues she experiences a vision of a Figure who is apparently Christ, though the Christ figure turns out to be closer to the figure of Palmer Eldritch:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>Elms, gazing at the Figure, said in a low voice, “Quite possibly I’m mistaken, but it seems to be changing.”</p>
    <p>She looked, but saw no change. Yet Elms seemed frightened.</p>
    <p>The Figure, in its white robe, walked slowly toward the seated Travis. The Figure halted close by Travis, stood for a time, and then, bending, bit Travis’s face.</p>
    <p>Agneta screamed. Elms stared, and Travis, locked into his seat, thrashed. The Figure, calmly, ate him.</p>
    <text-author>(5:381)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>Dick characterisically inverted the Christian sacrament of the Eucharist, with the result that rather than our eating the body and blood of Christ, Christ devours us, a trope for possession. In a kind of terrible pun, we become, literally, human hosts. If the Greek term <emphasis>omophagia</emphasis> means “to eat raw flesh” and “to assimilate and internalize one’s god,” then in Dick’s fiction this practice is commonly inverted as the god assimilates (that is to say, swallows) his votaries. The relationship to God (or the numen) is a relationship of predation; it is to exist, precariously, in the mouth of Leviathan. When his mouth shuts, he devours us, to paraphrase Eliot: this is the dreaded <emphasis>Deus Irae.</emphasis> In the <emphasis>Exegesis,</emphasis> Dick observed somewhat incredulously, “My worst book, DEUS IRAE, is my best” (159), and while it may not be his best book, one suspects why he thought it to be so. A relationship of predation exists between Silvia and the “angels” in “Upon the Dull Earth,” between Palmer Eldritch and Leo Bulero (and the hosts who consume Chew-Z) in <emphasis>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch,</emphasis> between the “carnivorous” Jory and Joe Chip (and the rest in cold-pac) in <emphasis>Ubik,</emphasis> and between the apparent Figure of Christ of “Rautavaara’s Case” and the human hosts on which he preys. Of course, predator/prey relationships lead to a kind of doubling or mimetic fusion (or hypnosis): Self identifies with Other, magically “absorbs” it, to keep it from disappearing and abandoning the helpless Self to its own resources. Jung called this form of mimetic fusion “dissimulation” (<emphasis>Collected Works</emphasis> 6:316,414), and it is, as we have seen, a key concept in Girard’s work as well.<a l:href="#n_88" type="note">[88]</a></p>
   <p>Indeed, Dick’s fiction, when looked at in terms of possession, is populated with characters possessed by alien antagonists: Spence Olham, the unwitting humanoid bomb in “Imposter” (1953); Keith Pellig, the android assassin controlled by many different personalities in <emphasis>Solar Lottery</emphasis> (1955); Pete Garden, who fears that he has committed murder while in an amnesiac (and hence, possessed) state in <emphasis>The Game-Players of Titan</emphasis> (1963); and even Rick Deckard in <emphasis>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</emphasis> (1968), who, in a moment of Dionysian vertigo, fears that he himself may be one of cruel androids he is hunting down to kill. Yet because the numen is ambivalent, Dick’s fiction contains benevolent possessions, or “divine invasions,” as well: the gentle wub which usurps the body of Captain Franco in the early short story “Beyond Lies the Wub” (1952); the possession of the phocomelus Hoppy Harrington by the metempsychosis of Bill Keller in <emphasis>Dr. Bloodmoney</emphasis> (1965); Bill Lundborg by Timothy Archer in <emphasis>The Transmigration of Timothy Archer</emphasis> (1982), and, in the <emphasis>Exegesis,</emphasis> Philip Dick by Thomas, by Jim Pike, by Elijah, and by other agents and agencies.</p>
   <p>Just so the point cannot be conveniently neglected, the <emphasis>Exegesis</emphasis> is overtly and virtually entirely concerned with Dick’s theories to explain his own possession by various agencies, both those which helped him and those which tormented him. Thomas, the early Christian; his friend Bishop Jim Pike; Elijah, the “plasmate”; “the AI voice”—all are benevolent agents or agencies which he identifies and examines. At one time, Dick speculates that messages from “the other side” are coming from his friend Jim Pike (4−5; as well as <emphasis>passim),</emphasis> in the context of which discussion Dick mentions William Peter Blatty’s novel <emphasis>The Exorcist</emphasis> (1971), a novel about possession.<a l:href="#n_89" type="note">[89]</a> At other times he writes of “that moment Christ was born in me, tic the year that followed was Christ in me, <emphasis>enthusiasmos</emphasis> by Christ: his kingdom or, more correctly, kingship” (197). But the point has been made, and a full examination the <emphasis>Exegesis,</emphasis> perhaps after more of it is published, must await another occasion.</p>
   <p>I hope that this chapter will prompt a literary criticism of Dick’s entire corpus that more fully accounts for his philosophical and religious obsessions, one that assumes that these obsessions are not late developments of his life (which they were not), or marginal in any definition of his fiction (they are not), but utterly essential to an understanding of it. It is true that in his early fiction—which emerged while Dick was living in the liberal, skeptical Berkeley of the 1940s and 1950s—the religious preoccupations are less overt, but I have come to the conclusion that Dick cannot be understood fully except by approaching him through the great historiographers and hermeneuticists of esoteric religion and the occult: Hans Jonas, Mircea Eliade, Gershom Scholem, and, above all, Carl Jung. I have drawn only on the latter’s thought for this chapter, but by using the knowledge provided by Jung and these other scholars, I am convinced that our understanding of Dick’s fiction will become vastly richer than it has been found so far.</p>

   <subtitle>NOTES</subtitle>
   <p>1. The ideograph is reproduced in Lawrence Sutin, Ed., <emphasis>In Pursuit of VALIS: Selections from the Exegesis</emphasis> 206 (hereafter <emphasis>Exegesis</emphasis>). Sutin says that Dick “saw a relationship between this ideograph and the Golden Fish necklace, as well as with the homoplasmate which he believed may have bonded with him. PKD [Dick] further saw a linking between this sign-when drawn repeatedly, to form a connective chain—and the DNA double helix; DNA and the homoplasmate were, in this view, analgous forms of living information” (206). See <emphasis>VALIS</emphasis> (§9.134−35).</p>
   <p>2. In <emphasis>VALIS</emphasis>, when the members of the Rhipidon Society arrive in Sonoma (Chapter 11), they begin looking for the Lamptons; Eric Lampton is wearing a T-shirt on which is written “SAVE THE WHALES.” Upon seeing the message on the shirt, Kevin immediately knew the wearer was Eric Lampton (§11.160).</p>
   <p>3.1 have greatly profited from R. D. Stock’s book <emphasis>The Flutes of Dionysus.</emphasis> His discussion of Rudolph Otto’s notion of the “Dionysiac-element” and what he calls “daemonic enthrallment” in literature was particularly useful, though our methodology differs in many respects.</p>
   <p>4. “Pigspurt” names a particularly difficult entity in Dick’s thought, a discussion of which will have to await other occasions. The name is a pun on “Sowjet,” the German spelling of “Soviet,” and thus would apparently indicate an aspect of Dick’s unconscious, perhaps even an autonomous persona, which Dick believed could be disinhibited, that is, called forth, by Soviet influence. In <emphasis>Dream Makers</emphasis> he told Charles Platt, “This rational mind [which invaded my mind] was not human . . . . Sometimes I would think it was the Soviet Union Academy of Sciences trying out their pyschotronic microwave telepathic transmitter” (155).</p>
   <p>5. See C-. G. Jung, <emphasis>Collected Works [Psychological Types]</emphasis> 6:136−146 for his discussion of “The Apollonian and the Dionysian.” Jung’s discussion of the “mask” in its most Nietzschean guise is in <emphasis>Collected Works</emphasis> 7:188−211 (“Anima and Animus”). His indebtedness to Nietzsche is discussed in Gerhard Wehr, <emphasis>Jung: A Biography,</emphasis> pp. 55−56; 72−73 and <emphasis>passim.</emphasis></p>
   <p>6. For help with this passage, see C. G. Jung, <emphasis>Collected Works</emphasis> 6:199−221; and <emphasis>Works</emphasis> 4, 363ff.; also Gerhard Wehr, 49−50. His discussion “Anima and Animus” is relevant here (see note 5). The <emphasis>Exegesis</emphasis> passage in which Dick comments on his novel <emphasis>Galactic Pot-Healer</emphasis> (195−96) is also relevant here, as is his discussion of his own psychic “integration” (97).</p>
   <p>7. It is significant that Dick began his career as a fantasist, but there was then no market for fantasy. He told Gregg Rickman, “I started off as a fantasy writer . . . . And I only wrote science fiction because there was much more of a market [for it] . . . . I was a very good fantasy writer, but outside of Tony Boucher . . . nobody existed to buy fantasy” <emphasis>(In His Own Words</emphasis> 61).</p>
   <p>8. In the <emphasis>Exegesis,</emphasis> Dick noted on 19 November 1977 that he had recently “reread some early stories in PRESERVING MACHINE” and as a result “scared myself shitless.” He goes on to say, “but my recent study of Gnosticism indicates that below any negative world-negating message there is an affirmation of God and love”(173). One can only idly speculate about which stories “scared” him, but if he had not read “Upon the Dull Earth” in over two decades, it certainly might have had the effect he states.</p>
   <p>9. There is a similar hallucinatory passage in <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> (1972), in which Louis Rosen sees the image of his love object Pris Frauenzimmer duplicated in every woman he meets (§17,189). A “Printer” creature, which duplicates whatever object is placed near it, appears in several of Dick’s stories, including <emphasis>A Maze of Death</emphasis> (1970) and <emphasis>Nick and the Glimmung</emphasis> (1988).</p>
   <p>10. The <emphasis>sparagmos</emphasis> is the rending, the tearing apart, the dismemberment of the sacrificial victim, in E. R. Dodds specifically associated with the infant Dionysus being torn apart by the Titans (<emphasis>The Greeks and the Irrational</emphasis> 155). The <emphasis>sparagmos</emphasis> is followed by the practice of <emphasis>omophagia,</emphasis> the consuming of the flesh of the victim. Gregg Rickman has observed that throughout the <emphasis>Exegesis</emphasis> Dick identified “with the tortured child-god Dionysus (Zagreus)” (“The Nature of Dick’s Fantasies” 277).</p>
   <p>11. Girard’s description of “possession” turns out to be quite similar to Jung’s concept of “dissimulation,” in that both describe one aspect of possession as being derived from projective identification. The fear of entrapment leads to dissociation rather than association (as in dissimulation). Dissociation is best described as the “possum response,” an <emphasis>imitatio morte,</emphasis> or a “splitting off” of autonomous personalities. Jung refers to dissociation as a “means of adaptation” <emphasis>(Works</emphasis> 6:206). In a somewhat different discussion (in a book Dick probably read), Norman O. Brown, in <emphasis>Life Against Death</emphasis> (1959), in the context of his own discussion of the Apollonian and the Dionysian (Chapter XII), discusses projective identification, or dissimulation, using Freudian concepts and terminology. The cognate process Brown (following Freud) names an effect of the “narcissistic libido” (162).</p>
   <p>12. E. R. Dodds, in <emphasis>The Greeks and the Irrational,</emphasis> speculates that “the idea of true possession, as distinct from mere psychic interference, derived ultimately from cases of secondary or alternating personality” and observes that “a new personality, usually differing widely from the old . . . appears suddenly to take possession of the organism”(66). His discussions of Dionysian possession, or “Dionysiac madness” are particularly illuminating (77, 271ff.).</p>
   <p>13. René Girard writes that “only Dostoevsky . . . in his early novel <emphasis>The Double</emphasis> . . . set forth in concrete terms the elements of reciprocity at work in the proliferation of monsters” (161). I would argue that Philip Dick writes about mimetic desire in an equally compelling way. In a slightly different approach, Louis Breger, in <emphasis>Dostoevsky: The Writer as Psychoanalyst,</emphasis> notes that the “ ‘splitting’ of the personality in <emphasis>The Double</emphasis> does not resemble the more popularly known cases of ‘split’ or multiple personality” but rather is an example of “the relatively rare autoscopic phenomenon,” in which there “is an encounter with a visual hallucination of oneself.” He concludes that it is likely that Dostoevsky “had firsthand acquaintance with the phenomenon,” as autoscopic phenomena are “associated with brain injury or temporal-lobe epilepsy” (269n1). Given that Philip Dick suffered a brain injury of undetermined severity in 1964 and that it has been hypothesized that he may have had temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), one wonders if Dick himself had firsthand acquaintance with the autoscopic phenomenon. See Breger’s footnote for references to the relevant psychiatric literature. Of course, in “The Double,” Golyadkin’s hallucinations are autoscopic, of Self rather than Other, the latter being the case with Dick’s “Upon the Dull Earth.” Obviously an autoscopic hallucination must be the anamnesis of the body image as previously seen in a mirror. If Dick suffered this kind of neurologically based hallucination, then it suggests that when he looked in the mirror, he sometimes saw another person. In fact, there is a scene in <emphasis>Solar Lottery</emphasis> (1955) in which precisely this event happens, to the character Ted Benteley (§6.67−68). The Greek myths of Narcissus, Nemesis and Echo are unavoidable associations; the image obsession in “Upon the Dull Earth” is transferred from Self to Other, but—most importantly—the solipsistic nature of the theme is otherwise unchanged.</p>
   <p>14. Sass takes this “untranslatable German term” (45) from Nietzsche and notes, citing De Chirico, that Nietzsche’s experience of the <emphasis>Stimmung</emphasis> coincides with his inspiration to write <emphasis>Thus Spake Zarathustra</emphasis> (424n18).</p>
   <p>15. I am not by any means suggesting that Dick was schizophrenic, even though he himself, given the psychiatric profiles of 1930s and 1940s, was diagnosed as and believed himself to be such. It is true that many of his symptoms would indicate a diagnosis of schizophrenia, but it is also true that much of his behavior contraindicated this diagnosis. I cite Sass’s discussion for the purposes of exposition. For a discussion of rival theories, see Gregg Rickman, <emphasis>To The High Castle, passim,</emphasis> and his <emphasis>Variable Man.</emphasis></p>
   <p>16. Dick discusses the schizophrenic break in terms remarkably similar to Sass’s. See the passage in the <emphasis>Exegesis</emphasis> where Dick discusses the schizophrenic “break” (96−97). Scott Bukatman, in <emphasis>Terminal Identity,</emphasis> cites a passage from Dick’s <emphasis>Martian Time-Slip</emphasis> describing Jack Bohlen’s schizophrenic break (§5.69), and describes its features as “a slippage of reality, a perception of the world which strips it of its status as real, and constructs it instead as a mechanical simulacrum of reality: a specular mimicry of the natural world” (51).</p>
   <p>17. In the <emphasis>Exegesis,</emphasis> Dick indicates that he had recently “reread STIGMATA” and “saw it for what it was.” He writes that the novel contained the “startling notion” that “imbibing of the sacred host culminated, for the imbiber, in eventually becoming the deity of which the host was the supernatural manifestation.” All of those who “imbibe” the sacred host become “the same deity, and their separate or human identities were abolished.” He concludes that this constitutes “an eerie kind of invasion” (171).</p>
   <p>18. Louis A. Sass describes a process whereby the schizophrenic engages in what Sass calls “double bookkeeping” (275), in which the subject is aware of the process of alienation but to which he submits with a sort of perverse fascination, and this seems analogous to what Girard is describing in this quoted passage. To push the analogy even further, the experience is similar to an encounter with Rudolph Otto’s “numen,” both the <emphasis>mysterium tremendum</emphasis> and the <emphasis>mysteriumfascinans,</emphasis> horror mixed with fascination.</p>
   <p>19. Dick discusses the concept of <emphasis>enthousiasmos</emphasis> with Rickman in <emphasis>The Last testament.</emphasis> See Chapter 13, especially 60−61; also Chapter 34, especially 216−222.</p>
   <p>20. See the letter to Dorothy (Dick’s mother) concerning Tessa (at the time, Dick’s wife) in <emphasis>The Dark Haired Girl</emphasis> (85−99), especially pp. 96−99, in which Dick suggests that he and Tessa are undergoing a mimetic fusion: “Tessa and I . . . have merge[d] two conflicting faulty systems into one faulty system which we’re content to share jointly” (98).</p>
   <p>21. Dick’s use of the phrase “the other side” is taken from Bishop Pike’s <emphasis>The Other Side</emphasis> (1968), which examines, among other things, the theme of the dead coming back to “take possession” of the living. Incidentally, <emphasis>The Other Side</emphasis> was one of that myriad of “sources of the Nile” that eventually flowed into Dick’s <emphasis>Ubik</emphasis> (1969).</p>

    <p>The Swiss Connection:</p>
    <p>Psychological Systems in the Novels of Philip K. Dick</p>
    <p>by Anthony Wolk<a l:href="#n_90" type="note">[90]</a></p>
   </title>
   <p>In <emphasis>The Transmigration of Timothy Archer</emphasis> (1982), the last novel Philip K. Dick completed, Tim Archer asks how an intelligent and educated man, a great man even, could ever get the notion that he should pick his generals by “astrological prognostications” (§8.2).<a l:href="#n_91" type="note">[91]</a> Archer is speaking of Count Albrecht von Wallenstein, the Austrian leader. The question has wider scope: It can be applied to Timothy Archer or to James Pike, the Episcopal Bishop of California, Dick’s model for Archer. Its broadest phrasing is, When did Everyman (or Everywoman) go mad?</p>
   <p>The term mad is used here in the sense of becoming obsessed with what Dick calls an “over-valent” idea. The older term is <emphasis>ideé fixe.</emphasis> Angel Archer, the Bishop’s daughter-in-law, gives an example of an over-valent idea entering the mind as a problem, mostly imaginary: You’ve just gotten into bed, but are you sure you switched your headlights off? Maybe you didn’t. And even though no lights are showing, you go outside to check, just to make sure. What’s happened, Angel says, is that you’ve gone crazy. You’re a psychotic who won’t accept “the testimony of your senses.” She extends the example, where you travel from bedroom to car, back and forth, testing the light switch, going back inside, then outside once more, an eternal closed loop. “You are no longer human,” she says; you are a “machine.”<a l:href="#n_92" type="note">[92]</a></p>
   <p>Angel Archer is a fascinating character. Like Dick himself, she has worked in a record store in Berkeley, written letters to the White House in the dead of night, currently drives a Honda, has a cat named Magnificat, and knows intimately the Episcopal Bishop of California. And she’s read so much psychology that she guesses that the idea of over-valence is from “somewhere” in Jung (§7.1).<a l:href="#n_93" type="note">[93]</a> Maybe it is. Who am I to doubt Angel Archer? But it’s also to be found in Ludwig Binswanger’s “The Case of Ellen West,” one of several case histories and articles in <emphasis>Existence: A New Dimension in Psychiatry and Psychology</emphasis> (1958), edited by Rollo May, Ernest Angel, and Henri F.</p>
   <p>Ellenberger.<a l:href="#n_94" type="note">[94]</a> In his analysis Binswanger is testing various labels in his effort to understand Ellen West: hysteria, existential craving, compulsion, phobia, and then the “Overvalent Idea” (351). In each case, however, the terms don’t fit the particulars of her case. Of course, Binswanger will offer a theory toward an understanding of Ellen West, a theory which must have appealed to Philip K. Dick, to judge from Richard Kongrosian in <emphasis>The Simulacra</emphasis> (1964), who looks back wistfully to “Binswanger or some of the other existential psychologists,” saying “They really understood me and my problem” (§6.1). “Obviously,” he adds, “they were precogs.”</p>
   <p>Later in this chapter I will return to the Swiss Existentialists, whose world view comes close to Dick’s own and contributes to his view of the cosmos. That discussion will complete what I have to say about how Philip K. Dick’s novels evolve in the psychological treatment of their characters (and worlds), from his early stories and from an early novel like <emphasis>Time Out of Joint</emphasis> (1959), to the spate of novels that appeared in the 1960s, from <emphasis>The Man in the High Castle</emphasis> (1962) onward. The novels that especially derive from Dick’s exploration of psychology are <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> (1972), <emphasis>Martian Time-Slip</emphasis> (1964), <emphasis>The Simulacra</emphasis> (1964), <emphasis>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</emphasis> (1968), as well as <emphasis>Timothy Archer.</emphasis></p>
   <p>This treatment will be necessarily limited. I am no John Livingston Lowes, tracing the subtle web that has at its heart Coleridge’s “Kubla Khan.” But I will note three strands that contributed to Dick. Besides Rollo May’s <emphasis>Existence,</emphasis> there is <emphasis>Language and Thought in Schizophrenia</emphasis> (edited by J. S. Kasanin, 1944, and reprinted by Norton in 1964),<a l:href="#n_95" type="note">[95]</a> and then there is the work of the neurologist Wilder Penfield. I will also briefly note Dick’s reading of Freud and Jung in my discussion of <emphasis>Time Out of Joint,</emphasis> though I think of that novel as the null case, where the ground is defined from which the palace rises. Whatever the reasons, Dick was intrigued with psychology from the very beginning of his writing career. But I would argue that it was Rollo May’s introduction of the existentialists in <emphasis>Existence</emphasis> that transformed him as a writer, that gave Dick a world view, which in turn he gave to his characters and his novels. And it was with him at the end in <emphasis>Timothy Archer.</emphasis></p>
   <p>As I said, I will return to the existentialists in some detail, but a brief description of their ideas might be helpful and satisfy curiosity. In <emphasis>Existence,</emphasis> Rollo May speaks of the “Existential Movement in Psychology,” which is a translation of the “<emphasis>Daseinanalyse</emphasis>; or existential-analytic, movement,” whose chief spokesman was Ludwig Binswanger (4). Binswanger describes the movement as arising from dissatisfaction with the prevailing efforts in psychiatry to acquire scientific understanding. It proceeds from Heidegger’s analysis of existence that has its root in the new conception that man cannot be understood any longer according to some theory, whether mechanistic, biologic, or psychological (4).</p>
   <p>One other note: My sole interest is to investigate Dick’s use of various psychological theories in his fiction. It is not my intent to plumb the depths of Dick’s own psyche (or to judge these theories from a modern psychiatric perspective).</p>
   <p><emphasis>Language and Thought in Schizophrenia (LTS)</emphasis> was edited by J. S. Kasanin (who later was the head of psychiatry at Mt. Zion Hospital in San Francisco) and is a series of essays which initially was presented in 1939 at a meeting of the American Psychiatric Society. The book has an introduction and conclusion, eight papers, as well as short sections by Kasanin between the various essays bridging each to the next. What it aimed to do was come at the language of schizophrenia from a variety of perspectives. Dick especially found fertile ground in the essays by Harry Stack Sullivan, John D. Benjamin (of the “Benjamin” Proverb test), Kasanin, as well as others (Kurt Goldstein and Norman Cameron). From the perspective of the critic, the effect of reading the essays in <emphasis>LTS</emphasis> is to say, “Oh, here’s <emphasis>Clans of the Alphane Moon</emphasis>: It looks like Dick took these five categories of schizophrenia from Kasanin, added a couple of others, and there you are. That’s how the germ of the idea in ‘Shell Game’ turned into a novel on the varieties of schizophrenia.” Or, “Hey! Here’s all that testing in <emphasis>Do Androids Dream</emphasis> and <emphasis>We Can Build You.”</emphasis> What Dick does with these essays, however, is more profound than employing surface allusions. Often, he questions the fundamental constructs of the analysis.</p>
   <p>Let me back up and examine Dick’s use of Kasanin’s classification of schizophrenia. Kasanin offers five categories of schizophrenia: the neurotic, who tries to arrive at a solution but fails; the dissociative (with ideas of “omnipotence,” of a “mission in life” and a “variable regard of the ordinary realities of life”); the “old” cases of delusions of persecution with a “general flatness in mood and some dilapidation” (“somewhat deteriorated”); the acute and episodic psychotic, “with marked overactivity” and a tendency to “extreme dramatization of conflicts”; and lastly those cases of “primary thought disorder,” with “striking involvement of intellectual functions” and “marked incoherence” (“neologisms,” “word salads”) (46−47). Immediately recognizable are Dick’s categories of schizophrenia in <emphasis>Clans</emphasis> (1964): the Norms, the Pares (paranoids), the Hebes (the “flat” hebephrenics), the Mans (the manics), and the Skitzs (the obscure visionaries). To these five categories Dick will add the Deps, the Polys, and the Ob-Coms. Dick takes these pathologies and shows how they can achieve survival value.<a l:href="#n_96" type="note">[96]</a> Dick’s schizophrenics (“careworn,” “pained,” “addicted to gloom” [§11.1]) become capable of patience, caring, and heroism. Kasanin’s analysis of the first instance (the neurotic) fits Chuck Rittersdorf, who may avert his “psychosis” despite his “basic maladjustment.” It’s “reversible,” a function of “special personalities and of the environmental stress” (48). It might also be described as a “mild paranoid reaction” which arose as “the only way of dealing with a serious instinctive conflict” (48). I am not trying to do a full-fledged reading of <emphasis>Clans</emphasis>—I merely want to show how Dick finds some of the material in <emphasis>LTS</emphasis> congenial.</p>
   <p>What’s more interesting is Dick’s reshaping (or undoing) of Kasanin’s thesis in “The Disturbance of Conceptual Thinking in Schizophrenia” that the schizophrenic is in effect an arrested (or regressive) case, unable to move beyond the concrete, to the ability to abstract and do categorical thinking—or having once achieved it, has lost the facility.<a l:href="#n_97" type="note">[97]</a> Kasanin distinguishes between the schizophrenic and what he calls the “organic” instance, where the person (either in utero or afterward) has sustained an injury which impairs neurological behavior. The schizophrenic once had the ability to abstract but has lost it. If given the task of sorting the varied blocks (a task devised by Vigotsky and Luria), the organic patient proceeds “mechanically,” without ambivalence, unaware that the task is classificatory.<a l:href="#n_98" type="note">[98]</a> The schizophrenic is “more aware of the problem” but is ambivalent and produces “artistic physiognomic groupings” (45). Or, as I see it,</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <image l:href="#_1.png"/>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>In <emphasis>Timothy Archer</emphasis>, Dick uses this opposition of concrete and abstract thinking vitally. In Kasanin there is a clear bias toward abstract thinking, “a property of the educated adult person” (42). Dick’s analog is Bishop Archer versus the clinically diagnosed schizophrenic Bill Lundborg. Tim Archer is highly abstract. Angel and Tim discuss Beethoven’s “purely abstract music,” whereas Tim notes Bill’s “inability to theorize,” his “trouble abstracting,” as Angel puts it (§8.2). Bill has been diagnosed as mentally ill and is unable to hold a job because of his “concretization”; he can “forget about being a computer programmer” because he can’t “desymbolize” or “think abstractly” (§6.2). Bill has a “cognitive impairment: his ratiocination was limited to the concrete” (§6.2). Tim Archer speaks of “hypothetical” cars, while Bill needs to know exactly what kind of a car they’re talking about—it will turn out that Archer doesn’t even know what make of a car he drives (§8.1). Angel Archer, who had been married to Timothy’s son Jeff, is a character who represents both kinds of thinking: it’s a balance rather than a hierarchy or opposition that Dick espouses. Angel and Tim talk about Jeff Archer’s “depersonalization,” his conversion into a “talking book” (§9.1). A pattern emerges:</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <image l:href="#_2.png"/>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Angel describes her night-long reading of Dante while in the throes of toothache, a night where books and reality became fused, where her intellectual and her practical life came together. And having come together, thanks to the infected tooth, they are never completely separate ever again (§9.1). Angel saw “totality,” no less real than the vision Dante had of God as the Trinity (§9.1). Tim Archer, however, in spite of his over-valent idea, this “one spurious premise,” is perceived as “clear-headed and sane” (§7.2). His madness is localized; he won’t be locked up; and depending on how <emphasis>crazy</emphasis> is defined, he is not crazy at all (§7.2).</p>
   <p>The Tim Archers of the world sail merrily on, well paid, driving their Chryslers and blind to the ground they walk on. Tim’s saving grace, however, according to Angel, is that fundamentally he a realist, “for all his double-domed educated flow of twaddle” (§12.1).</p>
   <p>We can extend the aforementioned paradigm:</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <image l:href="#_3.png"/>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Angel represents the via media. She says no to Archer’s abstraction and instead asks what she needs for herself, which is “immediate, fixed, real, tangible” (§13.2). It lies in this world; it has to do with her house and her job and with banishing ideas from her mind, “ideas about other ideas, an infinite regress of them, spiraling off forever” (§13.2).<a l:href="#n_99" type="note">[99]</a> At the very end Angel is with Edgar Barefoot, who reminds her of Tim. Having struck a bargain to have Barefoot’s <emphasis>koto</emphasis> record—“the record itself”—she says to herself that maybe Tim is still with them, depending on how you define him, whether it’s “the ability to quote in Latin and Greek and Medieval Italian, or the ability to save human lives” (§16.3). And the record is the ultimate in grounding, the chthonic, “The Mood of Early Spring.”<a l:href="#n_100" type="note">[100]</a></p>
   <p>Dick also drew extensively on <emphasis>LTS</emphasis> in <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> and <emphasis>D o Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</emphasis> Though he doesn’t mention <emphasis>LTS</emphasis> by name, Dick does mention a number of psychologists who are represented in the collection. J. S. Kasanin’s name shows up as the name of the mental health clinic that Louis Rosen goes to in Kansas City. Other federal mental health clinics mentioned include the Harry Stack Sullivan (San Diego), Fromm-Reichmann (Rochester), and Samuel Anderson (Baton Rouge).<a l:href="#n_101" type="note">[101]</a> Also mentioned are U. C. Hospital and Mount Zion (both in San Francisco) but these are not mental hospitals, but rather locales where, if necessary, they could do “brain-slicing” on Louis. More on brain-slicing later. But it’s John D. Benjamin who figures vitally by virtue of the Benjamin Proverb Test.</p>
   <p>Benjamin’s essay is entitled “A Method for Distinguishing and Evaluating Formal Thinking Disorders in Schizophrenia.” His point is that the Rorschach test is a “clumsy” instrument, especially in allowing one to predict the two stages of schizophrenia: “process schizophrenia” and “schizophrenic reaction,” that is, with and without formal thinking disorders—the latter is what Dick terms “situational polymorphous schizophrenia simplex” (<emphasis>Time-Slip,</emphasis> §5.4) (70−71). Benjamin’s methods include five devices, but his essay deals only with one: proverbs and phrases.<a l:href="#n_102" type="note">[102]</a> He cites fourteen proverbs and phrases, from “When the cat’s away, the mice will play” to “He travels swiftest who travels alone” (73). The patient’s task is to interpret the saying.<a l:href="#n_103" type="note">[103]</a> The schizophrenic’s typical response is literal-schizophrenics are poor at generalization. Benjamin is pressed for time and space in his essay, and so he cites (and analyzes) twenty responses to proverb 6: “A rolling stone gathers no moss.” No surprise then that it is “the fatal number six” that betrays Louis during Dr. Nisea’s interview and sends him on to the Kasanin Clinic (§17.2) It’s worth examining Louis’s response closely. At first he simply cannot remember the meaning. And then he takes a stab, that it relates to a person who is active, who doesn’t reflect, but that doesn’t sound right. He tries again, that it refers to someone who is always active, who keeps growing mentally and morally, who doesn’t “grow stale.” Dr. Nisea looks at him intently, so he adds, hoping to clarify his reponse, “I mean, a man who’s active and doesn’t let grass grow under his feet, he’ll get ahead in life.” Louis knows that as far as a legal diagnosis goes, he has betrayed a thinking disorder, and he is a schizophrenic. He asks if he’s gotten it backward, and Dr. Nisea says, yes, the meaning ordinarily is the opposite. Here Louis breaks in-he knows it now, it refers to an unstable person who never will acquire anything valuable. But it’s too late, and Doctor Nisea goes on to the next proverb. The die is cast The law is clear: Louis has demonstrated a “formal” thinking impairment.</p>
   <p>Louis’s response to proverb 6 comes very close to three of Benjamin’s examples:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>12. “That a person who is always busy doesn’t stop for reflection, doesn’t grow in mental and moral stature.”<a l:href="#n_104" type="note">[104]</a></p>
    <p>13. “Well, that means a fellow that’s ambitious, and keeps going, won’t get stale.”</p>
    <p>14. “A person who is active will not let grass grow under his feet, and will” get ahead.”</p>
    <text-author>(83−84)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>Benjamin has a full comment on proverb 13. He points out that “Number (6) is the only proverb on the list . . . to which it is possible to give a second, almost diametrically opposite, but meaningful, interpretation. . . . ‘A rolling stone’ is a passable symbol for ‘a fellow that keeps going’; and ‘gathering moss’ is certainly an excellent symbol for ‘going stale,’ as witness the word ‘mossback’ ” (83−84). Benjamin observes that the second interpretation was given by very few “normals” but was common among schizophrenics. His guess is that “they [normals] have often heard the proverb used ‘correctly’ ” (84). (All but one person in Benjamin’s study was familiar with proverb 6.) Benjamin suggests that the explanation for the “inversion” may lie in the common use of the expression “grass growing under your feet,” given that schizophrenics tend to interpret one proverb in terms of another or a familiar figurative phrase. While such a response isn’t “faulty,” it usually is combined with an interpretation that is limited (e.g., overly literal) (85). Benjamin says that a “true interpretation” must translate the symbols—or “desymbolize” them—to the categories or actions they represent (81).</p>
   <p>Later, at the Kasanin Clinic (after more than 200 controlled fugues), Dr. Albert Shedd suggests retesting Louis—with both the Vigotsky-Luria Block Test and the Benjamin Proverb Test, adding, “It’s more who gives the test than the test itself” (§18.3).<a l:href="#n_105" type="note">[105]</a> Louis passes both with flying colors and is legally free. Dr. Shedd, who doesn’t know about Pris being at Kasanin, says he doesn’t know what Louis was trying to avoid by coming there, but he advises him that he’ll have to live his life without falling back on the excuse of a mental illness that he probably never had in the first place (§18.4). And so Louis is “expelled.” He’s well, he tells himself. He’s tested out perfectly. He can go home to Boise; the government has “healed” him. He has everything, except for Pris. Pris. meanwhile, sits inside the Kasanin Clinic, “carding and weaving virgin black sheep’s wool, utterly involved, without a thought for me or for any other thing.”<a l:href="#n_106" type="note">[106]</a></p>
   <p>Obviously Dick uses Benjamin’s essay, but like Dr. Shedd he questions its validity, or perhaps its reliability. And by choosing the one proverb (6) that varies so specifically according to one’s lifestyle, Dick highlights a flaw in the system: that the testers are blind to the limitations of their test.<a l:href="#n_107" type="note">[107]</a> Yet there is no doubt that Pris is mentally ill; nor is there a clear refutation in <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> that the vast numbers of patients in the mental health clinics are unwarranted. Louis, however, is sane. Has he ever been otherwise? He calls himself “healed.” I’d say that, alas, Louis tragically fell in love with someone (Pris) who was mentally ill and could not be cured. The novel ends fatalistically, without love, or with love unrequited, and no hope for the protagonist. <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis>, which was written in 1962 and not published in novel form until 1972, differs from the later novels (such as <emphasis>Now Wait for Last Year</emphasis> [1966]), where the primary characters make the deliberate choice to assume responsibility, to live, to care for those that many of us would give up on. Angel Archer, when she turns down Tim Archer’s offer to accompany him to Israel, says that her life as “constituted” means too much to her. She fears “involvement” with the man. But there is a difference. Angel is not rejecting responsibility; she is choosing balance rather than an “infinite regress” of ideas “spiraling off forever” (§13.2). I’d still say that <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> is a fascinating and wonderful book. I love the interplay of the Lincoln and Stanton simulacra. And—though I also love Dick’s use of multiple points of view—I do get caught up in the two first-person novels, <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> and <emphasis>Timothy Archer.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Two last notes regarding John Benjamin’s tests. In <emphasis>Do Androids Dream</emphasis> Rick Deckard and his boss discuss the Voigt-Kampff test, which is used to detect androids. Their problem is that the test doesn’t distinguish between androids and those schizophrenic humans who exhibit “flattening of affect” (§4.1). Deckard cites Lurie Kampffs article, “Role-taking Blockage in the Undeteriorated Schizophrenic,” which compares “the diminished emphatic [empathic?] faculty found in human mental patients” with the responses of humanoid robots.<a l:href="#n_108" type="note">[108]</a> The test is comprised of various “social situations” and the subject expresses a “reaction” (§5.1). This comes close to the fifth of Benjamin’s “tests”: “repeating and finding the ‘moral’ to a story” (72). Not surprisingly, the androids (like some of Benjamin’s patients) quarrel with the questions or refuse to answer. The androids, in other words, by doing poorly on the test, resemble schizophrenics. Curiously though, Jack Isidore’s sense of the androids is as if “a peculiar and malign <emphasis>abstractedness</emphasis> pervaded their mental processes” (§14.1). Is Dick once again questioning the conventional psychiatric paradigm that takes proceeding from the concrete to the abstract as a sign of mental health?<a l:href="#n_109" type="note">[109]</a></p>
   <p>The Benjamin Proverb Test surfaces for the last time in <emphasis>Timothy Archer</emphasis> when Angel Archer arrives back at her little farmhouse in Berkeley and finds Bill Lundborg on her doorstep stroking her cat Magnificat and radiating “a kind of fondness, a kind of palpable love, that in fact was something new to me” (§6.2). Angel walks up to him “carefully,” finds out he’s Kirsten’s son, learns that his memory “isn’t very good” because of the electroshock, and offers him coffee.<a l:href="#n_110" type="note">[110]</a> The conversation goes strangely: Bill is so concrete, so direct, and whatever catches his eye is grist for the mill. Angel suddenly announces she’s going to ask him a question, shell give him an ordinary proverb and Bill has only to tell her what it means. She chooses three; “A new broom sweeps clean,” “The burnt child is afraid of fire,” and “It never rains but it pours”-Benjamin’s numbers 12, 4, and 3 (with slight variations on 12 and 4). Bill’s answers are literal: “It means that old brooms wear out and you have to throw them away.” Angel knows right off that Bill Lundborg has a thinking impairment; he has restated the proverb concretely, using the very terms in which it was phrased.<a l:href="#n_111" type="note">[111]</a> Angel knows that according to the Benjamin Proverb Test, Bill, who cannot desymbolize, who cannot think abstractly, “whose ratiocination is limited to the concrete,” is classically schizophrenic.<a l:href="#n_112" type="note">[112]</a> And-Dick would add-Timothy Archer was done in by the abstract, the ideas that “got him off the ground and then betrayed him” (§12.1), or the arrow that missed the mark by going “too high” (§3.3).</p>
   <p>Wilder Penfield (born 1891), who was the director of the Montreal Neurological Institute at McGill University was, in the words of Oliver Sacks, an “extraordinary” neurologist (<emphasis>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</emphasis> 137).<a l:href="#n_113" type="note">[113]</a> Dick must have thought otherwise. In the opening chapter of <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> Louis Rosen attributes problems at the Rosen factory to the mid-1960s brain-mapping and depth-electrode techniques of Penfield and Jacobson and Olds, especially their work on the “mid-brain” (§1.1). He notes that Rosen’s main competition, the Hammerstein Mood Organ, did take into account selective-frequency short-range shock transmission to the hypothalamus and stimulation of specific cells of the mid-brain. The Rosens failed to see the application, the easy transformation of the circuit switches to an organ keyboard. Louis admits that he’s tinkered at a Hammerstein Mood Organ and even enjoyed it. He describes how you can arrive at “new configurations of brain stimulation” and come up with new emotions that otherwise would never appear. But, as Louis says, that isn’t music-it’s “escape,” and he can do without it. Louis will want it even less when Dr. Horstowski informs him that if drug therapy does not work on him, they can turn to “brain-slicing in the region of the temporal lobes-based, of course, on extensive brain-mapping” (§5.2). Horstowski says, however, that he’d rather avoid brain-slicing, since often the section of the temporal lobes involved is destroyed. Louis agrees-he’d rather not; he’s had friends who’ve had it done, but it gives him the “shivers.”</p>
   <p>Dick may have known of Penfield from a variety of sources; <emphasis>Speech and Brain-Mechanisms</emphasis> (with Lamar Roberts) and “The Interpretative Cortex” both appeared in 1959. the latter in <emphasis>Science,</emphasis> for readers not specific to neurology, with the subhead, “The stream of consciousness in the human brain can be electrically reactivated.”<a l:href="#n_114" type="note">[114]</a> Penfield provides a short description of his work:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>Occasionally during the course of a neurosurgical operation under local anesthesia, gentle electrical stimulation in this temporal area, right or left, has caused the conscious patient to be aware of some previous experience. The experience seems to be picked out at random from his own past. But it comes back to him in great detail. He is suddenly aware again of those things to which he paid attention in that distant interval of time. This recollection of an experiential sequence stops suddenly when the electrical current is switched off or when the electrode is removed from contact with the cortex. This phenomenon we have chosen to call an experiential response to stimulation.</p>
    <text-author>(“The Interpretive Cortex” 1719−20)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>Dick was no doubt familiar with the illustrations that routinely accompany Penfield’s publications. They show shaved heads and exposed brains, surgical tools and small white “tickets” with black numbers lying idly on the brain. One specific picture that is common to each publication is the “layout of the operating room,” with the surgeon sketching the brain, another doctor in the background recording an electrocorticogram behind a glass partition, the fully conscious and “comfortable” patient, the anesthetist, as well as an observer who through a square window takes photographs by means of a mirror above the operating table. When a “positive effect” is achieved, the surgeon drops a “small ticket” with a number printed on it onto the surface of the brain for the benefit both of surgeon and photographer.<a l:href="#n_115" type="note">[115]</a> Since the purpose is surgery (osteopathic craniotomy) to remove the convolutions “thought to be the irritant cause,” patient and surgeon “must be able to talk back and forth” prior to “excision of epileptogenic areas, [in order to] map out functional areas of the cortex by stimulation” (Penfield and Perot, 610; Penfield and Roberts, 105−07).<a l:href="#n_116" type="note">[116]</a> The term <emphasis>map</emphasis> is also known as speech mapping or brain mapping-Dick uses the latter. As Oliver Sacks says, this is amazing work. Penfield cites a woman (D. F.) who</p>
   <cite>
    <p>heard an orchestra playing an air while the electrode was held in place. The music stopped when the electrode was removed. It came again when the electrode was re-applied. On request she hummed the tune, while the electrode was held in place, accompanying the orchestra. It was a popular song. Over and over again, restimulation at the same spot produced the same song. The music seemed always to begin at the same place and to progress at the normally expected tempo. All efforts to mislead her failed. She believed that a gramophone was being turned on in the operating room on each occasion, and she asserted her belief stoutly.in a conversation some days after the operation.</p>
    <text-author>(“Cortex” 1720)<a l:href="#n_117" type="note">[117]</a></text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>The tune was “Rolling Along Together.” Many of the case histories involve music, and since the patients can’t reproduce orchestras or individual instruments, they frequently “hum” for the doctor.</p>
   <p>Dick does so much with this material. When Louis Rosen finds out that Pris Frauenzimmer knows and is attracted to billionaire Sam Barrows, he rummages up a copy of <emphasis>Look</emphasis> magazine which has Barrows on the cover. It looks as if the shaved dome of Barrows’ skull has been cut away and in its place is a servo-system or a “feedback circuit of solenoids and relays.” operated from a distance. Louis imagines the operator sitting at the controls <emphasis>up</emphasis> above, “pawing at the switches with tiny tricky convulsive motions” (§3.1). Louis’s imaginary picture matches closely the illustrations of the operating theater, though Dick has exchanged the role of recorder for creator. And when Louis meets with Dr. Horstowski, the psychiatrist says he can help Louis comprehend his “reality−situation,” whereupon he opens a drawer jammed full with physician’s samples (§5.2). He comes up with Hubrizine, a brain stimulant that will make the patient more alert and cheerful as well as provide an optimistic view that things will work out by themselves. He then shows Louis how the drug compares to a setting on the Hammerstein Mood Organ. Louis reads the setting and sees that it’s close to the beginning of the Beethoven Sixteenth Quartet. Just looking at the setting has Louis feeling better already. He can almost “hum this drug.” And, of course, we are also in the opening scene of <emphasis>Do Androids Dream</emphasis> where Rick Deckard is awakened by the alarm from the mood organ. When his wife groans, Deckard tells her she set her “Penfield too weak” (§1.1). A bitter argument ensues as husband and wife threaten each other with contradictory settings: “‘If you dial,’ Iran said, eyes open and watching, ‘for greater venom, then 111 dial the same. 1*11 dial the maximum and you’ll see a fight that makes every argument we’ve had up to now seem like nothing. Dial me and see; just try me.’”</p>
   <p>What Dick has done is to extend a passive system, where the “local electric stimulation” which calls back a “sequence of past experience” becomes a device for generating new tracks, with the difference being that stimulus and response are now reversed—or, response and artificial stimulus (Penfield likens the interpretative cortex to a “wire recorder or a strip of cinematographic film” [Penfield and Roberts, 53]).<a l:href="#n_118" type="note">[118]</a> “We Can Remember It for You Wholesale” carries the system a step further, where Rekal Incorporated is able to lay false tracks on the cortex at will—it just so happens that in each instance a corresponding true track is discovered where the false track would lie.<a l:href="#n_119" type="note">[119]</a></p>
   <p>Another link to Wilder Penfield is Dick’s choice of a name for the primary antagonist in <emphasis>The Simulacra:</emphasis></p>
   <cite>
    <p>At the police station the thin-faced man in the heavy overcoat, smoking the Bela King handmade Philippine cigar, grinned out the window with flat, cold eyes, consulted his watch, then paced restlessly.</p>
    <p>He was just putting out his cigar and preparing to light another when he caught sight of the police car. At once he hurried outside onto the loading platform where the police were preparing to begin processing the individual in question. “Doctor,” he said. Tm Wilder Pembroke.”</p>
    <text-author>(§1.3)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>His “care” extends only to his cigar; he considers psychoanalysis quackery; and in response to Dr. Superb’s discomfort, he smiles. He belongs to a special category of Dickian traitors, the psychologist in the employ of government, whose work is not to cure individuals but to maintain the state.<a l:href="#n_120" type="note">[120]</a> At the novel’s climax, Pembroke will face the telekinetic (and schizophrenic) pianist, Richard Kongrosian. But to understand Kongrosian necessitates moving on to the Swiss Existentialists.</p>
   <p>In the last paragraph of his concluding remarks in <emphasis>LTS,</emphasis> J. S. Kasanin says we are at the point where we can describe the formal thought disorders in schizophrenia. Efforts now should be directed to the question, Why is the schizophrenic patient so disarticulated “from his social context?” (133). This is precisely the question which Dick will go on to explore in the novels from <emphasis>The Man in the High Castle</emphasis> onward-witness Richard Kongrosian on the phone with Janet Raimer:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>“Thanks for your loyalty,” Kongrosian said gloomily, “but you just don’t understand. This is no ordinary physical odor. This is an idea type odor. Someday “I’ll mail you a text on the subject, perhaps by Binswanger or some of the other existential psychologists. They really understood me and my problem, even though they lived a hundred years ago. Obviously they were precogs. The tragedy is that although Minkowski, Kuhn, and Binswanger understood me, there’s nothing they can do to help me.”</p>
    <text-author>(§6.1)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>Janet Raimer is oblivious to his problem. The McPhearson Act, by banning psychiatry (under pressure from the international drug cartels) has erased Kongrosian’s “great support in life,” Dr. Egon Superb; and without his psychiatrist Kongrosian sees himself “at the mercy of is life—long illness—process”-especially since recently he’s tangled with a Theodoras Nitz commercial (§6.1). Yet, strangely, he takes comfort in enduring the worst that the world can throw at him; “Anyone else in my situation” would be “totally autistic” by now. “This phobic-body odor,” he says, is obviously “a reaction-formation to a more serious disorder, one which would disintegrate my comprehension of the Umwelt, Mitwelt, and Eigenwelt.”<a l:href="#n_121" type="note">[121]</a> Janet Raimer, who ardently wants him to perform at the White House, is desperate in her own fashion. “Your current disappearance from the world,” she says, “is a tragedy.”</p>
   <p>Ironically, in referring to his “disappearance from the world,” she could not have been further from the essence of existential psychology, which is summed up in the word <emphasis>Dasein.</emphasis> Rollo May, in the second of his introductory essays in <emphasis>Existence,</emphasis> “Contributions of Existential Psychology,” begins by declaring that the “fundamental contribution of existential therapy is its understanding of man as <emphasis>being”</emphasis> (37). Binswanger, Kuhn, and other existential therapists designate their schools as <emphasis>Daseinanalyse. Dasein</emphasis> is composed of <emphasis>sein</emphasis> (being) plus <emphasis>da</emphasis> (there), and signifies that man is the being who is there, with the implication that he has a “there” in the sense that he can both know he is there and take a stand with reference to that fact. Not that the “there” is just any place, but the particular “there” is his own, a point in time as well as space. A vital consideration is that we can be conscious of. and hence responsible for, our existence (41).</p>
   <p>Richard Kongrosian is not the only Dick character to know the existentialists. In <emphasis>Martian Time-Slip,</emphasis> when Arnie Kott introduces Dr. Glaub as “the foremost living psychiatrist,” Glaub acknowledges, “It’s still the Swiss at Berghölzlei, the existential psychiatrists, who dominate the field” (§7.2). It’s no surprise then that Dick, in his 1974 interview with Paul Williams, says, “One of the most important books that I think I’ve ever come across in that area [the strange spaces people could get into], is a book called <emphasis>Existence,</emphasis> which was edited by Rollo May, and consisted of papers by the existential psychiatrists of Switzerland” (Rickman, 205). At the close of the third introductory essay in <emphasis>Existence,</emphasis> Henri Ellenberger cites Manfred<a l:href="#n_122" type="note">[122]</a> Bleuler on the value of existential analysis for schizophrenia, especially the refusal to see pathological expressions as absurd, illogical, bizarre, or defective in any other way. Instead it would understand the particular world of experience and focus on how this world is formed and how it falls apart (124). Dr. Glaub’s theories on schizophrenia (and Jack Bohlen’s as well) come directly from the existentialists: “the schizophrenic being out of phase in time” (§7.2), and that a schizophrenic “could not live out the drives implanted in him by his society” (§5.1).<a l:href="#n_123" type="note">[123]</a> Jack Bohlen elaborates on the latter.</p>
   <cite>
    <p>The reality which the schizophrenic fell away from—or never incorporated in the first place—was the reality of interpersonal living, of life in a given culture with given values; it was not biological life, or any form of inherited life, but <emphasis>life which was learned</emphasis>. It had to be picked up bit by bit from those around one, parents and teachers, authority figures in general . . . [Dick’s ellipsis! from everyone a person came in contact with during his formative years.</p>
    <text-author>(§5.1)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>Dick is making a powerful statement here, especially given the culture which is being passed on in <emphasis>Martian Time-Slip,</emphasis> with its “Public School” run entirely by robots, machines who/which are oblivious to the natural and “ceaseless flux” of values (§5.1). The School would like to “stabilize those values, to jell them at a fixed point—to embalm them.” Jack Bohlen had long ago decided this was neurotic, to want a world with nothing ever new, with no surprises. Such was the world of compulsive-obsessive neurosis, “not a healthy world at all.” What Jack is called to repair turns out to be the Kindly Dad, and while putting it through its paces Jack discusses schizophrenia with it, that “the Public School was set up to present a fixed milieu to the children born here” (§5.4). Kindly Dad is about as sympathetic as Janet Raimer. It speaks of squirrels, which don’t exist on Mars; it stands alongside an anachronistic fireplace and picture window. And it has never heard of the Bleekmen, the Martian autochthones, who—to pluralize Ralph Ellison—are invisible men (notably Kongrosian also imagines himself growing invisible). Once again we can shift perspectives: Is it the Jack Bohlens who are out of phase, or the School? In <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> Sam Barrows, the Penfield man, stands for a world of “rent-values,” just as Jack Bohlen’s father comes to Mars to “make a killing” in land speculation (§9.1). Dick’s protagonists reject such values, but at a terrible price. Eventually Jack Bohlen locates the glitch in the Kindly Dad: It’s “stuck” in its cycle; and—a voice of necessity—it keeps repeating itself: “Yes, Little Jackie, it has to be” (§5.4).</p>
   <p>Early in <emphasis>The Simulacra</emphasis> Richard Kongrosian identifies himself as an “anankastic” (§6.1), a word derived from the Greek <emphasis>ananke,</emphasis> or fate. V. E. von Gebsattel, in “The World of the Compulsive” (§6 of <emphasis>Existence),</emphasis> introduces this term to represent the compulsive for whom the phenomena of compulsion achieve their most extensive and systematic development, a type that “lives wholly in his very own special world” (172). Kongrosian, like Jack Bohlen, recognizes “the compulsive neurotic,” but Kongrosian (unlike Bohlen) sees the neurosis in himself and not as an aspect of the perverse culture which surrounds him: “He was, he knew, an anankastic, a person for whom reality had shrunk to the dimension of compulsion; everything he did was forced on him-there was for him nothing voluntary, spontaneous or free” (§6.1). Dick never tells us how Kongrosian became what he is, a psychokinetic pianist: he plays without touching the keys (like Mozart perhaps?). As such he has transcended his compulsion, his aversion to the filth of the material world, foreshadowing his later transcendence at the climax of the novel in his confrontation with Wilder Pembroke.</p>
   <p>The psychological makeup of Kongrosian is taken directly from the Patient H. H. as presented by von Gebsattel. H. H. was a seventeen-year-old who after his first nocturnal emission “noted an odor on himself and established that his penis was wet” (173). H. H. goes to elaborate ends to be assured this dripping has ended, standing at the toilet for hours on end, drying his penis carefully, or tucking his pelvis in. Nevertheless, “an ‘odor’ developed that stuck to his clothes and his coat and controlled him all day long” (173). At the time of analysis, five years later, he is still enveloped in his phobia. He has been removed from school, and “he is constantly possessed with the thought of smelling bad and, thus, with being conspicuous, which prevents him from talking to and associating with people. He cannot even telephone because of his obtrusive body odor” (173). Of course, this is the model for Richard Kongrosian, who drapes a handtowel over the telephone in hopes not to contaminate it, since he believes the odor “could be transmitted along the phone wires” (§6.1). Theoretically, “his phobic body odor could contaminate the entire world.” One irony in <emphasis>The Simulacra</emphasis> is that it is Conrad Goltz and, along with him, the entire secret system of government that suffers the worst phobias, that fears more than anything the flux of life. Thus their use of von Lessinger’s time apparatus is an effort to arrive at certainty, to eliminate any chance upheaval in the status quo. When Egon Superb is told he can keep his practice open until a certain new patient appears, he is drawn into their web, and he notes that his “thinking . . . had become obsessive; it went around and around, getting nowhere” (§8.2). Again, it’s like H. H. trapped in a loop, having to “think everything through once more” (173). What if he didn’t perform his rituals quite right? This an extreme instance of the “over-valent idea” (351), the “eternal loop” with the headlights that Angel Archer described.</p>
   <p>For the later aspects of Richard Kongrosian, Dick draws on a second case history, Eugene Minkowski’s “Findings in a Case of Schizophrenic Depression” (<emphasis>Existence,</emphasis> §4). Minkowski’s patient imagined that the whole world was aware of his crimes (e.g., not being a French citizen), evidence of which was obvious from the behavior of passersby in the street and from every newspaper article. He called this ubiquitous focus in himself his “residue politics,” a “political system that had been instituted especially for him”; someday “every leftover, all residue, would be put aside to be stuffed into his abdomen” (128).</p>
   <p>I would like to back away from the closing of <emphasis>The Simulacra</emphasis> for a bit and describe-briefly-how Binswanger’s analysis works, how it goes beyond the psychoanalytic (of cause and effect), beyond the phenomenological analysis of the inner world of schizophrenia, to the existential encounter, the “decisive inner experience” which results from the meeting of the two individuals, analyst and patient, through which “something totally new is revealed, new horizons open, one’s <emphasis>Weltanschauung</emphasis> is revised, and sometimes the whole personality is restructured” (119).</p>
   <p>I will limit myself to Ellenberger’s discussion of Ludwig Binswanger’s “I/thou” and “I/him” modes of relationships and how these can inform a reading of a Dick novel or two.<a l:href="#n_124" type="note">[124]</a> Binswanger was one of the first Swiss followers of Freud; then in the early 1920s he became one of the first proponents of psychiatric phenomenology. In 1944, working at the Burgholzli Clinic, having shifted toward existential analysis, he published a number of clinical cases, among them “The Case of Ellen West” (included in <emphasis>Existence).</emphasis><a l:href="#n_125" type="note">[125]</a> Binswanger was also influenced by Martin Buber’s <emphasis>I and Thou.</emphasis> For Buber, the I-Thou relationship allows one to express one’s whole being and expect reciprocity. This is the primary and spiritual sphere of the encounter. In the I-Him, relationship the “I” is expressed with just a part of one’s being: It is the “sphere of utilitarian relationship” (121). Binswanger terms these the dual existential mode (the intimate I-Thou relationships, such as parent and child, lover-beloved) and the plural mode (formal relationships: competition and struggle).<a l:href="#n_126" type="note">[126]</a> To the dual and plural modes Binswanger added the singular mode (one’s relationship to oneself, a mode which sheds a new light specifically on the autistic world of Manfred Steiner) and the anonymous mode (e.g., a dancer in a masked ball, or the soldier in battle-Richard Kongrosian, and later, Jason Taverner in <emphasis>Flow My Tears, Policeman Said</emphasis> [1974], as well as Bob Arctor in <emphasis>A Scanner Darkly</emphasis> [1977] in his scramble suit).</p>
   <p>Consider Milton Glaub in <emphasis>Martian Time-Slip.</emphasis> Initially he accepts the proposition of Arnie Kott and says anything Arnie wants to hear.<a l:href="#n_127" type="note">[127]</a> What choice does Glaub have, given his low income, the roof that needs repairing, the barrenness of life on Mars? He spouts the Burgholzli ideas as his own-remember that the quick fix on Mars has the analyst literally act as surrogate for the stressed clients, going in their place. When Norbert Steiner kills himself (the radiating event of the novel), Glaub hopes it won’t reflect badly on himself; and he tries to play politics with Anne Esterhazy, using her anomalous son Sam as a pawn (§11.4). Jack Bohlen, in a moment of absolute vision, sees Dr. Glaub for what he is, “a thing composed of cold wire and switches, not a human at all, not made of flesh” (§7.3).<a l:href="#n_128" type="note">[128]</a> The fleshly trappings melt and become transparent, and Jack Bohlen sees the “mechanical device beyond.” But Dr. Glaub will take heart from the heroic instance of Jack Bohlen, who refuses to abandon the autistic child, having learned “what it would be like to be cut off from the world, isolated, the way Manfred is” (§12.1). Feeling “a rush of sympathy” for Bohlen, “for his dogged instincts to go on in his own manner,” Glaub volunteers to deal with the “master circuit” for him. Glaub then places a phone call to Arnie, to urge him to let Jack off the hook for the evening, but Arnie stiffens, and when Glaub gives up, Arnie refers to him as “that gutless wonder,” “too cowardly to say what he was thinking” (§12.2). But Glaub <emphasis>(faith</emphasis> in German) calls back, and, speaking in a “thin, unnatural voice,” says he must protect his patient. And Arnie backs down. The last we see of Glaub, he and Anne Esterhazy have intercepted Amie’s car on the way to Old Knobby, and Glaub tells Arnie that this is the end of his “career of bullying and domineering” (§14.4). “Leave Jack Bohlen alone,” he says. “I represent him, and he needs rest and quiet. You’ll have to deal with me.” Glaub’s mode of existence has shifted drastically, toward sympathy and responsibility. Henri Ellenberger, in speaking of the therapeutic implications of existential analysis, says that if the therapy “is done with genuine interest in the patient himself, the patient feels understood. He will be like the miner imprisoned under earth after an explosion, hearing the signals of the rescuers; he does not know when they will arrive, or whether they will be able to save him, but he knows that they are at work, doing their best, and he feels reassured” (123−24).</p>
   <p>Back to Richard Kongrosian. Close to the end of <emphasis>The Simulacra,</emphasis> Wilder Pembroke, himself a psychologist, pays a visit to Dr. Superb in hopes of finding a solution to the problem of what will happen when the psychokinetic pianist finds out that Nicole Thibodeax is a fake (§13.3). Reassured, Pembroke goes ahead with his coup, killing Conrad Goltz. When he and Nicole find Janet Raimer’s body, Pembroke says not that they were “coerced into doing that,” rather that “taking care of Miss Raimer was an act of pure, enjoyable volition” (§14.2). “Care” for Pembroke, like for Arnie Kott, means “destroy.” But waiting in Nicole’s office is Kongrosian in the throes of a breakdown. “I no longer can keep myself and my environment separate,” he says. Objects—a vase with roses—become a part of him, and he becomes a part of them. <emphasis>“I‘m turning inside out,”</emphasis> he wails. “Pretty soon if this keeps up I’m going to have to envelope the entire universe and everything in it, and the only thing that’ll be outside me will be my internal organs—and then most likely I‘ll die.” At this point Richard Kongrosian is synonymous with Eugene Minkowski’s patient, who one day will be “stuffed” with residue “from all over the world” (128). “And,” writes Minkowski, “all this he would have to swallow; “the smallest thing, the most minute act of daily life, was immediately interpreted as being hostile to him” (128).</p>
   <p>But Kongrosian is what Dick would call a “variable man.”<a l:href="#n_129" type="note">[129]</a> When Pembroke threatens him with a gun, the gun leaves Pembroke’s hand and vanishes into Kongrosian’s body; and in Pembroke’s hand is a pink mass of lung tissue. When Pembroke drops it Kongrosian says, “he didn’t take care of it-he let me fall” (§14.2). And the next thing Pembroke knows Kongrosian has “shut off something” inside him. In four hours he’ll be dead. Pembroke asks if it can be turned back on, but Kongrosian will be too “busy” collecting himself, “evicting every foreign object that’s managed to enter me . . . . I want myself back.” And he glowers at the spongy lung tissue on the ground: “You’re me . . . . You’re part of the I-world, not the non-I.” When Nicole asks him to move her far away, he says, “Who knows how far I can move you—I don’t. As Mr. Pembroke said, I haven’t really learned the political uses of my ability, even after all these years. But anyhow, now I’m in politics.”</p>
   <p>Quite a difference. Minkowski, speaking of his patient, says he gave “no thought to the present or the past” (132). Unlike most people, who use facts as a basis for planning the future, this “carry-over from past and present into the future was completely lacking in him” (132). In his life there was no generalization and no action, nothing but a series of “dull, similar days,” every day an “exasperating monotony of the same words, the same complaints, until one felt that this being had lost all sense of necessary continuity. Such was the march of time for him”: <emphasis>“the future was blocked”</emphasis> (133).<a l:href="#n_130" type="note">[130]</a> His “energy was attached to this inevitable event” (133). But for Richard Kongrosian the future exists. The energies that well up in him find an outlet, psychokinetically and politically. The paradigm from Martin Buber applies here as well: Kongrosian moves from the anonymous mode to an integration with the world.</p>
   <p>Earlier the Nitz commercial threatened to destroy Kongrosian’s “comprehension of the Umwelt, Mitwelt, and Eigenwelt” (§6.1), terms central to existential analysis. In defining the “Three Modes of the World,” Rollo May calls them “simultaneous aspects of world which characterize the existence of each one of us as ‘being-in-the-world’ ” (61). May states, “First, there is <emphasis>Umwelt,</emphasis> literally meaning ‘world around’; this is the biological world, generally called the environment. There is, second, the <emphasis>Mitwelt</emphasis>, literally the ‘with-world,’ the world of being of one’s own kind, the world of one’s fellow men. The third is <emphasis>Eigenwelt,</emphasis> the ‘own-world,’ the mode of relationship to one’s self (61). Like Glaub, Kongrosian’s being is integrated, has come home, is in harmony with self. When he phones Arnie Kott back, Glaub says it’s “essential to . . . [his] integrity” to protect his patients (§12.2)—<emphasis>integrity</emphasis> is a word with the same root as <emphasis>integration.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Having described his patient’s daily life, Minkowski asks a question remarkably like Kasanin’s concluding question about the disarticulation of the schizophrenic from “from his social context” (133): <emphasis>“Where, exactly,”</emphasis> Minkowski asks, <emphasis>“is the discordance between his psyche and our own?”</emphasis> (131). I would say that drawing on the psychological insights provided by existential analysis. Dick in his novels bridges that gap of discordance: for Jack Bohlen, for Jack Isidore in <emphasis>Do Androids Dream,</emphasis> for the androids themselves, for Dingaling Bill, as well as for Mr. Tagomi, Jack Bluthgeld, Hoppy Harrington, Barney Mayerson. This close consideration of the world that the individual lives in enables the existentialist to understand that individual. As Dick says of “The Caseof Ellen West”: Binswanger “tried to figure out where her head was. . . . I don’t think in any book I’ve ever written, or any book I’ve ever read, that there was that much difference of a point of view. . . . By the time he had discerned how she saw the world, it was as totally different a universe from ours as if she was on another planet in another solar system . . . . It was incredible, how different she perceived” (Rickman, <emphasis>To the High Castle</emphasis> 205). When Angel Archer asks how “an intelligent, educated man, a great man really,” like Timothy Archer, could “begin to believe” the “occult crap” about his son returning from the grave—and even more, that he could go to the Holy Land and recover the essence of a living Jesus (§§8.2, 13.2)—she is asking the same question the existentialists felt to be the <emphasis>sine quae non</emphasis> if ever they were to understand and help their patients.</p>
   <p>A similar question lies at the heart of <emphasis>Time Out of Joint,</emphasis> which Dick completed in 1958. But an existential reading doesn’t apply, doesn’t inform the novel. <emphasis>Time Out of Joint</emphasis> is a null case. The differences are pertinent and interesting. There is no influence of Binswanger or others of the Berghölzlei school. As the novel opens, Ragle Gumm is gradually becoming sane. He is beginning to receive signals that the world he lives in is false: a soft-drink stand goes “out of existence,” and “in its place was a slip of paper” with the words “SOFT-DRINK STAND” printed on in it block letters (§3.3). Ragle’s explanation is that he’s “having a nervous breakdown” (§4.2). When Ragle tries to come to terms with what is going on, he turns to Bishop Berkeley and the Idealists and the “Central problem in philosophy. Relation of word to object,” that a “word is more real than the object it represents” (§4.3). By now in his metal box there are six slips of paper. At novel’s end, Mrs. Keitelbein explains all: how Ragle, who saw “patterns sooner than anyone else,” was taken to live in a reconstructed town, and how her faction (the Lunatics) “planted the . . . word slips” to bring Ragle back to reality (§13.3). Earlier, Ragle had termed the anomalous events hallucinations.</p>
   <p>I’m like Ragle early on. I don’t have an explanation that covers how Ragle could see the soft-drink stand one moment and not the next. The explanations in the novel begin by being philosophical and end physically.<a l:href="#n_131" type="note">[131]</a> Perhaps the best sort of explanation lies in the “programming” associated with the Korean War and exemplified in Richard Condon’s novel <emphasis>The Manchurian Candidate</emphasis> (1959; and later the film, 1962). Bill Black says Ragle got himself into a “dilemma,” and the only solution lay in a “withdrawal psychosis . . . into a fantasy of tranquillity . . . . Back to a period before the war. To his childhood. To the late ‘fifties, when he was an infant” (§14.4). Since they needed Ragle’s talents they arranged a nearly stress-free world, and before long he had a “full-scale retreat fantasy going.”<a l:href="#n_132" type="note">[132]</a> And it’s not just Ragle who has accepted this reconditioned world as real but others, too: Margo Black, chosen for her personality-type to be a member of Ragle’s household. Bill Black says they’ll “believe it until [they’ve] . . . been reconstructed . . . . You’ll keep on seeing what you’ve been seeing. The training is all there, on a nonrational level. Impressed on your systems.” Mrs. Keitelbaum adds to the explanation that Ragle keeps “wanting to go back . . . . The pull on you is strong. The tug back into the past” (§14.7). The difference between Ragle and the others in the Old Town is that they volunteered. And on Ragle “the camp technique fastened the last elements of his withdrawal into the past” (§14.9).</p>
   <p>I can’t quite get my hands on Ragle Gumm. Despite the fact that he’s pre-cognitive, he’s a regressive with a fondness for the past.<a l:href="#n_133" type="note">[133]</a> What will prevent him from withdrawing the next time the going gets tough? What will prevent him from returning to a “fantasy of tranquillity” (§14.4)?</p>
   <p>It’s significant that neither J. S. Kasanin nor the existentialists see schizophrenics as withdrawing into a world of dreams. The final topic in Kasanin’s conclusion to <emphasis>LTS</emphasis> addresses the “old idea that schizophrenics spend a great deal of time in fantasy”:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>If a schizophrenic is really afraid of his ambivalent tendencies, one would not expect too much fantasy, and this seems to be the case. Beck finds that there is no such thing as a rich fantasy life in schizophrenia.<a l:href="#n_134" type="note">[134]</a> On the contrary, fantasy life is constricted and not expanded. The patients who spend years in bed do not have a rich fantasy life; they may have grotesque ideas and fantasies, but these are mere distortions. The schizophrenic patient, like the obsessive neurotic, is not creative. He does not transmit his experiences into something new and rich, but misconstrues the world as presented.</p>
    <text-author>(132)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>In an earlier comment, Kasanin says the schizophrenic “animates things, embellishes them, toys with them, projects himself into them, and creates something quite different from the product of the ordinary performance of the injured brain” (40)<a l:href="#n_135" type="note">[135]</a> Minkowski would, I think, agree. As the “synthesis of the human personality disintegrates,” he writes, “there remains only the person face to face with a hostile universe” (137). And von Gebsattel’s anankastic H. H., whose enemy is “forever at his heels,” is “in constant tension, ceaselessly at work to have it out with the enemy” (186). Little time is left for the play of fantasy. Nor do I see Dick’s schizophrenic characters taking it easy, at least not the ones from <emphasis>The Man in the High Castle</emphasis> on.<a l:href="#n_136" type="note">[136]</a></p>
   <p>It seems clear to me that Dick’s reading of the existentialists drastically changed what happens in his fiction. They present an integrated view of the individual and the world, all three worlds, Eigenwelt, Mitwelt, and Umwelt. Their rich phenomenological description of mental illness and the depth of their involvement with their patients are congenial to an artist’s generation of characters in a troubled world—the artist, like the analyst, must care about each and every person generated from the writer’s psyche, unless the writer is willing to settle for stereotypes or unauthentic entities. The existentialists go the next step, beyond the psychology that “all the housewives”—and Philip K. Dick—were reading in the 1950s.</p>
   <p>There’s so much to notice in Dick’s writing. Like Dick, the existentialists were concerned with every living being. But it’s in the most extreme cases, when societies are falling apart, when the Bomb has fallen, that Mr. Tagomi, briefcase on his lap, is unable to sit calmly and listen to the options for a new fuhrer. It’s at astigmatic moments like these that Dick opens the windows the widest onto ourselves.</p>

On Dick’s reading of Carl Jung, note, for example, <emphasis>Dr. Bloodmoney</emphasis> (1965), where Hal Barnes, the new mushroom man, arrives for his interview with a copy of Jung’s <emphasis>Psychological Types</emphasis> (§8.1). And in <emphasis>The Game-Players of Titan</emphasis> (1963) Dick mentions “Jung’s and Wolfgang Pauli’s theory of the a causal connective principle” (§4.2).</p>
   <p>5. Dick acknowledges in a letter written June 8, 1969 having been “very much influenced by the thinking of the European existential psychologists” and specifically their use of the Heraclitan concepts of the <emphasis>idios kosmos</emphasis> and the <emphasis>koinos kosmos,</emphasis> as well as the <emphasis>anti-eidos,</emphasis> or form-destroyer (an entropic factor) (reprinted in Gillespie [31−33]). Also see Sutin (300, 305, 324), as well as Dick’s letter of April 25, 1962, to Tony Boucher (quoted in full in <emphasis>The Philip K. Dick Society Newsletter</emphasis> 30). In his interview with Rickman, Dick spoke of the importance of “the existential psychiatrists of Switzerland,” and specifically Binswanger’s “The Case of Ellen West” (Rickman 205).</p>
   <p>6. The likelihood is that Dick knew <emphasis>LTS</emphasis> in its 1944 University of California edition, given that <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> was written in 1962.</p>
   <p>7. In “Shell Game” (1954), the root story for <emphasis>Clans of the Alphane Moon,</emphasis> a space ship bound for a hospital planet has crashed. The story describes failure, the inability to cope (the patients are to varying degrees all paranoid). See Karl Wessel’s discussion of “Shell Game” in Chapter 3.</p>
   <p>8. Kasanin is working with the formulation of Vigotsky and Luria that in the child there are “usually three stages” in development of thought: the physiognomic (animating objects and projecting the child’s ego into them); then “concrete” thinking” (“realistic and literal”), and lastly abstract thinking (41−42). Note the elitist aspect that pervades the book—for example, “uneducated” people whose categorical thinking is limited (42)—which in turn fits in with Tim Archer’s obsession with books and Bill Lundborg’s with cars. Ultimately Dick is allied with his Isidores rather than his Archers, or other “big domes” (cf. <emphasis>Our Friends from Prolix 8</emphasis> [1970]).</p>
   <p>9. In <emphasis>We Can Build You,</emphasis> Pris Frauenzimmer and Louis Rosen both take the “Vigotsky−Luria colored blocks test” (§3.1; also §17.2 and §18.4).</p>
   <p>10. See also the last moment of <emphasis>Now Wait for Last Year</emphasis> (1966): “Life is composed of reality configurations so constituted. To abandon her [your wife] would be to say, I can’t endure reality as such. I have to have uniquely special easier conditions” (§13.2). Note also that the Bodhisattva chooses compassion over wisdom; and Barefoot [grounded literally] provides the sandwich to go with the ideas. See also Binswanger’s discusion in “The Case of Ellen West” of three worlds: the grounded world of “practical action”; the “ethereal” of “highest ideals”; and the third world, beneath the earth, of encumbered desire (274−77). To the third of these worlds is appended a note to Schiller’s play about Wallenstein, which figures significantly in <emphasis>Timothy Archer.</emphasis> The reference to Ellen West needing to be rescued from “a world out of joint” (276) I take to be a fortuitous coincidence. Yet it’s instructive to follow Binswanger’s imagery, that Ellen is struggling in this world so “out of joint” to keep “both feet firmly on the ground.” The “laborious building up a world in little things is constantly ‘opposed by the temptation of effortlessly flying” in the realm of the “ethereal.” The term “ethereal,” Ellen West’s own term, becomes Dick’s term for the wish for escape from problems in the here and now. As such it is associated with emigration off-planet, or Thisbe Holt’s space brothel, and the Wind God, George Walt in <emphasis>The Crack in Space.</emphasis> Jack Isidore’s moving closer in to the center in <emphasis>Do Androids Dream</emphasis> is the opposite movement.</p>
   <p>11. In Dick’s essay, “Man, Android and Machine” he writes, “What melts away the rind or layer of frozen ice over the world each year is of course the reappearance of the sun. What melts the ice and snow covering the characters in <emphasis>Ubik,</emphasis> and which halts the cooling-off of their lives, the entropy which they feel, is the voice of Mr. Runciter, . . . none other than that same voice which each bulb and seed and root in the ground, our ground, in our wintertime, hears” (208). See also Juliana Frink, whom Hawthorne Abendsen calls “a daemon. A little chthonic spirit . . . doing what’s instinctive to her, simply expressing her being” (§15.3). For a fuller discussion, see my “The Sunstruck Forest: A Guide to the Short Fiction of Philip K. Dick” (1980 [21−22]). For a rich discussion of Dick’s model for Tim Archer, see William Stringfellow and Anthony Towne, <emphasis>The Death and Life of Bishop Pike .</emphasis> The last words of <emphasis>Timothy Archer,</emphasis> “Were he [Tim] alive” (§16.3), are reminiscent of the words on Pike’s gravestone: “AND LIFE IS VICTORIOUS” (418).</p>
   <p>12. Samuel Anderson was an analyst (“a good one”) for both Dick and his wife Anne in the early 1960’s (mentioned in the letter to Tony Boucher of April 25, 1962).</p>
   <p>13. The other four are logical problems, classification of geometrical figures, repeating and finding a moral to a story, and solving a problem in ingenuity (71−72). With the exception of <emphasis>Do Androids Dream</emphasis> noted later, I haven’t noticed instances where Dick plays with these others.</p>
   <p>14. Benjamin mentions one instance where the patient refuses to undertake the task, which brings to mind the typical evasive android response in <emphasis>Do Androids Dream.</emphasis></p>
   <p>15. Benjamin calls proverb 12 a “false desymbolization” and “unmistakenly schizophrenic” since it equates “gathering moss” with growth in “mental and moral stature,” the whole a “piece of schizophrenic pseudo profundity” (83).</p>
   <p>16. Drs. Nisea and Shedd—I’m never sure when to pursue a name or when to allow Dick simply a straightforward invention. These appear to be the latter.</p>
   <p>17. “Thing,” the last word of the novel, may carry a special message (the last words of about half of Dick’s books do): the person versus the machine, Pris seeing Louis as the “thing.” She’s not even involved with simulacra any more.</p>
   <p>18. Compare Ursula K. Le Guin’s “SQ” (in <emphasis>The Compass Rose),</emphasis> where the society turns inside out, with nearly everyone institutionalized and no one on the outside.</p>
   <p>19. I haven’t traced the “Leningrad psychiatrists” (§4.1) Voigt and Kampff, but “Lurie” is close to “Luria,” Vigotsky’s coworker in Moscow. The notion of deterioration is central to Benjamin’s hypotheses, since <emphasis>“only those cases with formal thinking disorders tend to ‘deteriorate,’ and . . . the severer these disorders are, the greater the chances for, and the quicker the course of, the deterioration”</emphasis> [Benjamin’s italics] (67−68).</p>
   <p>20. Note the three responses to “When the cat’s away, the mice will play” where the control gets away from the “highly concrete type of answer” to the more “abstract rendering of the meaning” (81). An additional note: I think Dick would have considered the androids schizophrenic, but they might instead be regarded clinically as psychopaths, who also show an absence of normal affect. I am, however, steering clear of current psychiatric views of mental illness. What nevertheless is clear is that the androids as a class are lacking in empathy, which follows from their abstractedness. Dick would most likely perceive caring (or empathy) as a concrete response to a fellow being.</p>
   <p>21. Coffee is always a good signal in Dick; and the word <emphasis>care</emphasis>—as well as <emphasis>help</emphasis>—is another inevitable characterizing sign in Dick, whether <emphasis>care, careful, careless,</emphasis> etc. (for example, the care Bill takes in spooning out food for Magnificat moments later). See Angel’s last conversation with Edgar Barefoot where all three signs are used vitally (§16.3). And for an ironic use, see Arnie Kott’s last words to Dr. Glaub and Anne Esterhazy, the gangster’s threat: “I’ll take care of both of you” (§14.4).</p>
   <p>22. Angel also uses “Vanity, thy name is woman,” which Bill recognizes as a quotation. Benjamin’s proverb 13 has “Ingratitude” for “vanity,” a “purposeful” misquote from Hamlet’s “frailty” in order to, in Benjamin’s words, “elicit possible [complex-determined] responses to what is, after all, an absurd statement” (86).</p>
   <p>23. While Kirsten Lundborg closely resembles Maren Bergrud, Bill Bergrud is, I’m fairly sure, an invented character, since Bergrud had no children. In that respect he is like Angel Archer, since Bishop Pike’s son Jim was never married.</p>
   <p>24. Robert B. Livingston’s review of Penfield and Roberts’ <emphasis>Speech and Brain Mechanisms</emphasis> in <emphasis>Science</emphasis> describes Penfield as “thoroughly humane” (1731).</p>
   <p>25. For a comprehensive summary of work, see Penfield and Phanor Perot.</p>
   <p>26. For example, Penfield and Roberts, 106−08.</p>
   <p>27. “Brain mapping” is not mentioned in the article in <emphasis>Science.</emphasis></p>
   <p>28. Also Penfield and Roberts, 52; Penfield and Perot, 620.</p>
   <p>29. In <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> Dick also cites the work of Olds and Jacobson. Jacobson I have not identified (unless Dick is thinking of Penfield’s predecessor, Hughlings Jackson). But Old is James Olds, author of <emphasis>The Growth and Structure of Motives</emphasis> (1956), on S/R (stimulus/response) psychology. As a quasi-appendix, Olds presents “A Brief Model of the Association System of the Brain,” which describes a <emphasis>“recording strand</emphasis> immersed in the brain field, which is a series of recording units” (260). By “recording strand” he means generically “a long narrow series of recording elements such as the wire of a wire recorder, the tape of a tape recorder, the filmstrip of a motion picture recorder, the groove of a phonograph record, and so forth” (262). This description sounds like Garson Poole’s tape in Dick’s story “The Electric Ant” (1969). Olds surmises that “the recording strand in the brain is a preformed contact chain of neurons in the association area,” with “each neuron [being] . . . a recording unit, and that one neuron becomes specified or fixed at each moment of time” (263). In “Ant” Dick reverses the analogy. In Poole (an android), the strip is prerecorded; and reality derives (paradoxically) from the strip. When Poole fiddles with his strip (i.e., his brain), reality is modified.</p>
   <p>30. In his 1972 Vancouver speech, “The Android and the Human” (in Gillespie), Dick, playing with notions of totalitarianism, writes, “I wonder of you recall the so-called ‘brain-mapping’ developed by Penfield recently; he was able to locate the exact centres of the brain from which each sensation, emotion, and response came. By stimulating one minute area with an electrode, a laboratory rat was transfigured into a state of perpetual bliss. They’ll be doing that to all of us, too, soon,’ a pessimistic friend said to me, regarding that. ‘Once the electrodes have been implanted, They can get us to feel, think, do anything They want”’ (60). Dick goes on to describe an absurd scenario where, because of shoddy manufacturing of electrodes, the “Washington DC Thought Control Centre would overload . . . and set fire to the White House.”</p>
   <p>31. For example, the robot analyst in “The Chromium Fence” (1955), who “was supplied by the controlling institutions of the state” and whose tag reads, “PROPERTY OF THE FEDERAL COUNCIL” (§2).</p>
   <p>32. For a discussion of these terms, see page 117 of this Chapter.</p>
   <p>33. Is this the source for Manfred Steiner? Angel Archer shares a name with one of the editors of <emphasis>Existence.</emphasis></p>
   <p>34. In “The Chromium Fence” the robot analyst says, “You’re out of phase with your society”; which Don Walsh interprets as “Something has to give, and it’s got to be me” (§2).</p>
   <p>35. What amazes me is what I leave out: references to my favorite of all Dick novels, despite its ambiguous ending, <emphasis>The Man in the High Castle</emphasis>—as well as <emphasis>Dr. Bloodmoney, Ubik, Galactic Pot-Healer,</emphasis> and on and on.</p>
   <p>36. For further reading in Binswanger, especially see Binswanger, <emphasis>Being-in-the-World.</emphasis> Lawrence Sutin cites one essay therein, “Extravagance” (324), and though it is valuable, I don’t know for a certainty that Dick used it directly. The next time I work through the Dick corpus, I’ll be alert for uses of the word <emphasis>extravagance.</emphasis> Also note Binswanger’s “Existential Analysis and Psychotherapy,” in <emphasis>Progress in Psychotherapy,</emphasis> eds. Fromm-Reichmann and Moreno (New York, 1956), cited in <emphasis>Existence</emphasis> (4), especially since the “Fromm-Reichmann” is one of the clinics mentioned in <emphasis>We Can Build You.</emphasis></p>
   <p>37. See also Arnie Kott and the Bleekmen, or the Titanians and Terrans in <emphasis>The Game-Players of Titan,</emphasis> and of course the androids and humans in <emphasis>Do Androids Dream.</emphasis> It’s an analysis which is generally useful (e.g., in <emphasis>The Tempest,</emphasis> Ferdinand and Miranda versus Prospero and Caliban, until the end).</p>
   <p>38. In his interview with Charles Platt <emphasis>(Dream Makers),</emphasis> Dick cites how in <emphasis>Martian Time-Slip</emphasis> he dealt with the premise “that the subjective world of one rather powerful person can infringe on the world of another person. If I can make you see the world the way I see it, then you will automatically think the way I think” (148).</p>
   <p>39. This is the moment when a character sees <emphasis>sub species aeternitatis</emphasis> (Spinoza, <emphasis>Ethics,</emphasis> Part V Proposition XXX)-cf. <emphasis>Do Androids Dream</emphasis> (§9.1). Dick often has the character liken it to astigmatism, such as Mr. Tagomi in <emphasis>The Man in the High Castle</emphasis> (§14.2) or in Dr. <emphasis>Bloodmoney</emphasis> Bruno Bluthgeld’s “astigmatism, which became acute when he was under stress” (§5.1).</p>
   <p>40. See “The Variable Man” (1953) where Cole represents the unexpected, the unforeseen.</p>
   <p>41. Von Gebsattel’s H. H. similarly was incapable of letting his “energies stream into the implementation of a task-oriented self-development,” which led to “a choking or blocking of the life course” (176).</p>
   <p>42. See “Exhibit Piece” (1954), where the psychological puzzle dissolves with the realization that both worlds are real, thanks to a time portal. Or “The World She Wanted” (1953) where the explanation for a warping of reality is philosophical.</p>
   <p>43. Note the difference in the later “Retreat Syndrome” (1963/1965), where the explanation is not mechanical, but psychological. John Cupertino never does accept any explanations, persevering in what he “believed” (§6). Yet the opening scene, from the point of view of Peace Officer Caleb Myers, presents a rift in reality, when Myers sees Cupertino put his hand through his dashboard as though it weren’t there. It’s like the ending of “The Electric Ant,” where Garson Poole’s reality imposes itself on the rest of the world. In his short stories, even the ones from the 1960s, Dick is likely to leave the story in paradox. “Frozen Journey” (1980), nearly the last of Dick’s stories, sustains the psychological fugue.</p>
   <p>44. See also Virgil Ackerman in <emphasis>Now Wait for Last Year</emphasis> and his reconstruction of “Wash-35” (§2.2), or Jason Taverner and his antique snuff boxes, emblems of characters whose orientation is away from the present; or best of all, Mr. Childan in <emphasis>The Man in the High Castle</emphasis> and the whole industry of antique fakery trumped up for the benefit of the occupiers-until the appearance of a genuine and contemporary art form provided by Frank Frink.</p>
   <p>45. J. S. Beck, “Errors in Perception and Fantasy in Schizophrenia,” in <emphasis>LTS</emphasis> (91−102).</p>
   <p>46. It may be this passage that Dick recalls at the end of <emphasis>Timothy Archer</emphasis> when Bill Lundborg has Tim Archer and his ideas whizzing around in his head. “Have fun with your thoughts,” thinks Angel. “That is what Harry Stack Sullivan said schizophrenics do: they have endless fun with their thoughts and forget the world” (§15.1). If Sullivan says that, I don’t know where he does it. Did Dick know Svillivan’s <emphasis>The Interpersonal Theory of Psychiatry</emphasis> (1953), which in Part III deals with mental disorders? Dick does in fact mention Sullivan in <emphasis>Time Out of Joint,</emphasis> when Ragle is apprehensive, imagining Bill Black catching him having an affair with his wife Junie: “Guilt transformed . . . fantasy of doom as a just payment for my transgressions.” Ragle thinks that this is what “the psychiatrist would say,” and “all the wives, having read Harry Stack Sullivan, Karen Homey, and Karl Menninger” (§11.2). There are also several references to Sigmund Freud in the novel, but they are commonplaces: such as that Freud says “there’s always a psychological reason” (§5.4). Clearly, Dick has been reading. Also note “The Mold of Yancy” (1955), where Dick has transformed an un<emphasis>-Kindly Dad-</emphasis>ish Yancy who now reads <emphasis>The Journal of Psychological Review</emphasis> instead of <emphasis>Dog Stories Monthly.</emphasis></p>
   <p>47. Isidore in <emphasis>Confessions of a Crap Artist</emphasis> (written in 1959) is a last null instance.</p>

    <p>Unrequited Love in We Can Build You</p>
    <p>by Rebecca A. Umland</p>
   </title>
   <p>In the latter half of the twelfth century, Chretien de Troyes composed his now famous romance, <emphasis>Lancelot,</emphasis> for his wealthy patroness, Marie of Champagne. The work recounts the quest of Lancelot for his lover, Queen Guinevere, who has been abducted by a wicked knight. In his frenzied pursuit of his beloved, Lancelot rides his horse to its death and finds himself stranded. Conveniently, an ill-mannered dwarf appears driving a cart, but not just any old cart: “In those days such a cart served the same purpose as does a pillory now . . . to do service for all those who commit murder or treason, and those who are guilty of any delinquancy” (274). Naturally, Lancelot is reluctant to ride in such a dishonorable cart, but the dwarf persuades him that this is the only way to reach the queen. Thus, “the knight hesitated only for a couple of steps before getting in. Yet it was unlucky for him that he shrank from that disgrace . . . for he will later rue his delay” (274). Indeed, Lancelot pays for this momentary hesitation; after several more trying adventures, he finds the queen, but instead of welcoming her would-be rescuer, she rebukes him: “You showed you were loathe to get in [the cart], when you hesitated for two whole steps. That is the reason why I would neither address you nor look at you” (327).</p>
   <p>Chretien’s narrative makes clear the devastating effects of Lancelot’s “love” for the queen, not only by the knight’s hyperbolic and foolish actions (e.g., nearly falling off his horse as he worships a strand of her hair, almost tumbling out of a tower in order to catch a glimpse of her), but also, continuing the tradition of Ovid, in the statement that common sense is “inconsistent with love’s dictates” (274) and by lamenting that “reason reaches only his [Lancelot’s] lips, but not his heart” (275). Lancelot’s “love” is thus shown to be idolatrous passion; it is obsessive, foolish, runs contrary to “reason,” and is likened to madness.</p>
   <p>What, one might rightly ask, does a medieval cleric and romancer have in common with a twentieth-century novelist noted for his science fiction? An important examination of a universal human impulse, if we view Dick’s work from a new perspective. By focusing on an accomplished yet neglected novel, <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> (written 1962; published in novel form in 1972), I hope to recontextualize Dick by placing him in a shared tradition—the nostalgia for and use of an idealized courtly past—with other significant twentieth-century American writers such as Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Steinbeck, and E. A. Robinson. Like these writers, Dick employs the courtly paradigm to express his own private vision. I also hope to suggest that Dick read and absorbed much more widely and deeply than has been supposed. The narrow image of Dick as a SF writer who often cranked out serial novels for a popular audience should be challenged, and <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> is an example of a novel that can help to do just that, in that its level of sophistication places Dick in a more select category of writers. Patricia Warrick notes in <emphasis>Mind in Motion</emphasis>, “According to Anne Dick, Dick regarded <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> as a <emphasis>literary</emphasis> novel; and when his agent could find no publisher, he gave up writing in this form” (66; emphasis mine).</p>
   <p><emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> is a mainstream novel because there is no real attempt at an adequate explanation of the creation of the simulacra, and, even more significant, the entire simulacrum scheme is subordinated to—even an excuse for—the Pris/Louis (non)relationship, which is one of unrequited love, the true concern of the novel. This seems not to be understood by Kim Stanley Robinson, who, in <emphasis>The Novels of Philip K. Dick,</emphasis> refers to <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> as “the epitome of the broken-backed novel in Dick’s work” (105). It becomes apparent that Robinson considers the novel as such because of his own expectation that it ought to be something which it never set out to be: a SF work. Because of this assumption, Robinson finds fault with the novel since “a developing story is entirely derailed while a narrator, author, and readers are forced to attend the fortunes of a mentally troubled young girl, and the equally troubled narrator” (<emphasis>Novels</emphasis> 106). Robinson falsely accuses Dick of switching horses in the middle of the stream by privileging the Louis/Pris story and abandoning the simulacrum angle. But the novel focuses on the love interest from the beginning, with the simulacrum as a convenient, if contrived, manner of forwarding the love triangle of Pris/Louis/B arrows. That Dick intended this seems clear from the preceding comment (that he considered it a “literary” novel). Douglas Mackey understands this, as he calls the work “an experimental novel masquerading as straight science fiction” (53). I will attempt to show that the novel employs the paradigm of the courtly love relationship, though distorted, as it is by other moderns. Though this is not the only Dickean work to employ the model, it is perhaps the most overt use of the motif in the <emphasis>oeuvre.</emphasis><a l:href="#n_137" type="note">[137]</a></p>
   <p>The general psychological profile of Louis Rosen’s “love” for Pris, her treatment of him, and the (non)resolution of this dilemma is modeled on the medieval courtly paradigm. Louis’s love is obsessive, irrational, unrequited, likened to a mental disease, and it involves a competitive triangle (at least in Louis’s mind) with Sam Barrows. The love is closely associated with death, which places it in the <emphasis>liebestod</emphasis> tradition of German romanticism, of which the Tristan and Iseult myth is the best example (more about this later).<a l:href="#n_138" type="note">[138]</a>Pris, who creates simulacra that are more human than she, represents the contemptuous, remote lady, whose shrewish, emasculating quips only increase Louis’s passion. Her insults are part of a firmly established courtly tradition; in fact such rude behavior only inspires medieval knights to accomplish greater feats of prowess and/or to act with great courtesy and generosity of spirit.<a l:href="#n_139" type="note">[139]</a> Therefore, in the world of medieval romance, such behavior is never criticized, nor is it, interestingly enough, in <emphasis>We Can Build You.</emphasis><a l:href="#n_140" type="note">[140]</a></p>
   <p>Finally, the fact that Louis’s love remains unrequited, that he must leave Pris in her “ivory tower,” divorced from life and calmly weaving a rug from black virgin sheep’s wool, also reveals a resemblance to the courtly model. At the end, Pris is, in fact, a kind of Tennysonian “Lady of Shalott” for whom contact with the real world (as opposed to the shadow world of her hermetic, womb-like, virginal tower) is deadly.</p>
   <p>It is significant that one of the simulacra is Abraham Lincoln and that his role as public figure is virtually ignored. Instead, Dick dwells upon Lincoln’s mental illness and its cause: unrequited love. The Lincoln simulacrum is the most human, the most compelling figure in the novel, and it is no coincidence that it is he who has the debate with Barrows (closer to an android) about what it is to be human (§9.88−92). Thus, even the secondary plot of the novel focuses on unfulfilled love (all-consuming passion), or at least its result. For Lincoln is depicted through the eyes of Louis as enobled by his unhappy love for Ann Rutledge, who met an untimely death from malaria, thus bringing on Lincoln’s “meloncholia” and this “manic depression” (§14.151, 153). But, as Denis de Rougemont candidly remarks in his study, <emphasis>Love in the Western World,</emphasis></p>
   <cite>
    <p>Happy love has no history. Romance only comes into existence where love is fatal, frowned upon and doomed by life itself. What stirs lyrical poets to their finest flights is neither the delight of the senses nor the fruitful contentment of the settled couple; not the satisfaction of love, but its passion. And passion means suffering.</p>
    <text-author>(15)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>In fact, Louis goes so far as to assert that the Lincoln simulacrum is his double: “Lincoln was exactly like me. I might have been reading my own biography” (§14.153). They share the same psychological disorder, the love malady.</p>
   <p>In <emphasis>Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature,</emphasis> Erich Auerbach asserts that the courtly model is an ideal that necessarily becomes debased or distorted when applied to everyday life:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>As soon as it transcends the sphere of mere conventions of intercourse and has to do with the practical business of the world, it proves inadequate and needs to be supplemented, often in a manner most unpleasantly in contrast to it. But precisely because it is so removed from reality, it could—as an ideal—adapt itself to any and every situation, at least as long as there were ruling classes at all.</p>
    <text-author>(137)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>Auerbach uses the romances of Chretien as an example of what is meant by the courtly model, though even this medieval epitome of courtly love shows the degree to which the ideal is antithetical to practicality. Likewise, Denis de Rougemont posits, “In all likelihood courtly chivalry was never more than an ideal” (32), arguing that it developed in the twelfth century “as a reaction to the brutal lawlessness of feudal manners . . . of marriage [made by nobles] simply as a means of enriching themselves” (33). And, as D. W. Robertson has argued repeatedly, the concept of courtly love becomes even more absurd when viewed as anything other than a literary convention. Scholars seldom agree on what constitutes “courtly love,” so to assume that it actually existed is even less plausible (“The Concept of Courtly Love as an Impediment to the Understanding of Medieval Texts” 259). What is generally assumed, however, is that it involves a passion outside of marriage (regardless of whether this passion actually finds sexual expression) between a lady of high social status and a knight who often sacrifices his personal pride in order to meet her arbitrary and often unreasonable demands. “This courtly loyalty, however, displays one curious feature. It is opposed to the ‘satisfaction’ of love as much as to marriage . . . . <emphasis>Whatever turns into a reality is no longer love”</emphasis> (de Rougemont’s emphasis, 34). Ideally, both knight and lady should gain esteem and generate character; but often, as we see in the romances of Chretien, the love runs contrary to reason and good sense. The result is that “courtly love” causes grief and pain for the lover, whether he is a medieval knight or a twentieth-century organ salesman.</p>
   <p>If Louis Rosen is a “failed knight,” the object of his affection, Priscilla Rock (a.k.a. Pristine Frauenzimmer), belongs to a long line of courtly ladies, the archetype of which may be seen in Chretien’s Guinevere. Pris, however, both rejects this role and, at the same time, uses it to her advantage. In her reluctance to serve as an object of adoration and inspiration, she shares similarities with Hemingway’s Brette Ashely in <emphasis>The Sun Also Rises</emphasis> and with Daisy Buchanan in <emphasis>The Great Gatsby.</emphasis> As Kim Moreland astutely notes in her study “Courtly Love in America: Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald Present the Lady and the Vamp,”</p>
   <cite>
    <p>these writers’ nostalgia for the courtly love tradition . . . and their sense that this tradition no longer worked very successfully in the modern world, had especially important ramifications for their creation of female characters . . . . These women are largely blamed for the failures and limitations of the male protagonists-Jake Barnes and Jay Gatsby-since the modern woman’s refusal to act as a locus for male aspirations undermines the reason and thus the possibility for knightly adventure in the modern world.</p>
   </cite>
   <p>Thus, Moreland argues, “the many parallels between the events . . . and the courtly love tradition are skewed, as though seen through a distorted and distorting lens” (19−20).</p>
   <p>The same may be said for Dick’s use of the courtly paradigm as for that of Hemingway’s and Fitzgerald’s. Yet it must be emphasized that as Dick uses the courtly model in <emphasis>We Can Build You,</emphasis> certain features are exaggerated so that it becomes a <emphasis>futile</emphasis> paradigm in that Louis is <emphasis>not</emphasis> enobled by it, and his suffering accomplishes <emphasis>no</emphasis> positive, visible results, either for himself or for Pris. Moroever, the Ovidian notion of love as a disease is rendered literal by Louis’s schizophrenia, a particular psychiatric disorder. This is complicated by the fact that Louis’s discharge from Kasanin Clinic (his banishment, engineered by Pris) suggests that he really did not suffer from the disease he professed to have, that instead he merely used it to gain access to the compound in his quest for Pris, whom he hopes to rescue. (His sexual hallucination, however, belies the notion that he is only pretending to be ill.) But Pris refuses to be rescued, Louis’s love remains unrequited, and his quest is aborted, a failure.</p>
   <p>In his study, <emphasis>America and the Patterns of Chivalry,</emphasis> John Fraser examines the preoccupation with the medieval past in American culture. He remarks that “chivalric romanticism makes the idea of failure insidiously attractive” and that “adolescent male pessimism about sexual relations—a yearning for the perfect woman to serve, and a conviction of the inevitability of failing to find or keep her” (33) is a notable pattern in twentieth-century American fiction. Later in his work, Fraser cites Steinbeck, who points to the pervasiveness of the chivalric ideal in American cultural consciousness: “Steinbeck may not have been exaggerating much when he said that ‘I don’t know any book save only the Bible and perhaps Shakespeare which has had more effect on our morals our ethics, and our mores than . . . Malory”’ (68). What is germane about this remark is that one need not assume that a writer “knew” Malory—or any other writer of medieval romance—in order to have been “influenced” by courtly love literature. It has so permeated our culture that a sometimes fruitless and dull source study is unnecessary. Dick wrote <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> in 1962—during the heyday of Kennedy’s Camelot—though the novel was not published until 1969 (and only then in magazine form, not yet as a novel). But in it Dick continues the tradition of the nostalgic if distorted yearning for an idealized past. Seen in this light, <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> prompts a reasessment of his accomplishments as a mainstream writer and resituates him as a main continuator of a prevalent American literary tradition, as a close reading of the Louis/Pris relationship will reveal.</p>
   <p>Louis’s passion for Pris begins as soon as he sees her (in Chapter 3 of the novel). Pris has been released from the Kasanin clinic and is in the care of her father, Louis’s business partner, Maury Rock. Two physical qualities of Pris are emphasized in the initial descriptions of her: her nubile appearance, though she is actually 18 years old at the time. She is described as “doll-like”—a feature that will be even more pronounced in her epigone, Pris in <emphasis>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheepl</emphasis> (1968)—and as wearing pink pedal pushers. Also described is her emotionless, death-like beauty (her “widow’s peak”) and to Louis she looked “like a dance of death creation animated in some weird way” (§3.22).</p>
   <p>Another feature which is significant is her emasculating ability, which Louis notices immediately and which the novel continues to underscore. As she sits on the floor intently snipping tiles for her mozaic, Louis tells Pris, “I know what the pliers symbolizes . . . Emasculating thousands upon thousands of males, one after another” (§3.28). Such a comment is surely meant to be humorous, and it is-except that the humor is undercut by the fact that Pris really does possess this power, using words like razor blades to slice away at Louis’s already low self-esteem (erotically speaking). And during an aborted love scene in a motel room, when Louis and Pris alternately lose their nerve (again, erotically speaking), Louis remarks, “I’ll make an appointment with the hospital tomorrow and have myself castrated or whatever they call it” (§10.104). She repeatedly goes for the masculine jugular—in her relations with Louis, but also with Barrows—knowing instinctively the Achilles heel of each. For example, early on Pris fires a series of personal questions at Louis: “Why aren’t you married? Are you a homosexual? Did some girl you fell in love with find you too ugly? How old are you?” (§4.33) She then goes on to disparage his physical appearance. Later, she does the same thing to Barrows in an ugly scene which occurs in a Seattle bar, winding up with the killing remark, “You’re just too old and flaccid, you old fairy” (§16.164).</p>
   <p>At no time is this behavior criticized in the text, doubtless in part because we see Pris through the eyes of the first-person narrator who happens to be in love with her. But we applaud Pris when she insults Barrows in such a manner, because she is angered over the fact that he has overseen, without her knowledge, the creation of the John Wilkes Booth simulacrum. Barrows is an unattractive character and we enjoy vicariously Pris’s emasculating endeavor here.</p>
   <p>More important, however, is the fact that Pris’s quips against Louis only increase his passion for her. For instance, Louis finds Pris in Seattle and plans to steal her away from Barrows. In a phone conversation, Pris insults Louis, calling him “a low-class poor ugly nothing” and ordering him to leave her alone. When he hangs up the receiver, he confesses, “I shook with relief. I trembled and quaked at having gotten off the phone and away from her, away from the calm, stinging, accusing, familiar voice. Pris, I thought. I love you. Why? . . . What twisted instinct is it?” (§13.148). Here is an example of the distorted courtly model-ordinarily the shrewish tongue will have a much needed edifying influence on the knight, but not so here. However, while recognizing this as a “twisted instinct,” Louis still feels gratification at having received a healthy (?) dose of abuse from Pris.</p>
   <p>Like Hemingway’s Brette Ashely and Fitzgerald’s Daisy Buchanan, Pris has an emasculating power, though Louis, like Jake Barnes, may already be impotent. If so, his quest to recover his own masculine identity is thwarted by Pris, an (almost) unwilling object of his libido. If, however, Kim Moreland is correct in her assertion that Brette Ashely and Daisy Buchanan are “largely blamed for the failures and limitations of the male protagonists” (19), then Dick’s text varies from this pattern in that it clearly does <emphasis>not</emphasis> blame Pris for Louis’s failings.</p>
   <p>Suffering, however, is a primary component of “courtly love.” As de Rougemont observes, in the passage quoted earlier, “Happy love has no history . . . and passion means suffering.” Louis recognizes this, and thus exonerates Pris of any blame for his own pain. As he agonizes to himself, he acknowledges this:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>What did I do? . . . Fall in love with her? A woman with eyes of ice, a calculating, amibitious schizoid type. . . . It was as if Pris, to me, were both life itself—and anti-life, the dead, the cruel, the cutting and rending, and yet also the spirit of existence itself . . . . Did I enjoy suffering? No. It was that it seemed as if suffering was a part of life, a part of being with Pris. Without Pris there was no suffering, nothing erratic, unfair, unbalanced. But also, there was nothing alive . . . . But suffering was an indication that reality was close by . . . . Pris made us endure [torment] by her very presence. It was not something she did to us deliberately; it was a natural outgrowth of what she was.</p>
    <text-author>(§12.126−127)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>This is a key passage in that it contains the love psychology explored in the novel. First, Louis equates his love (or love object, Pris) with life and antilife—death. In this way, his passion evokes the <emphasis>leibestod</emphasis> motif of a fated and fatal love that can only lead to death, a crucial point that will be discussed in greater detail later. Second, this suffering is a measure of life for Louis, an indication of “reality.” Denis de Rougemont cites Rimbaud: ‘“Real life’ is <emphasis>elsewhere . . . . </emphasis>‘Real life’ indeed is but another name for Death, and the only name we have dared <emphasis>to invoke it</emphasis> by—even while pretending to fend it off” (51).</p>
   <p>Louis’s suffering also defines him as human rather than android, a heartless machine. Perhaps most significant is the fact that Pris is not responsible for the suffering she causes—it is “natural.” Even the rational Stanton admires Pris’s temper, avering that “temper is the anvil of justice” (§6.53). One wonders how Stanton <emphasis>knows</emphasis> Pris well enough to make such pronouncements about her character. Pris’s role as lifegiver and source of suffering is one characteristic of the relationship that resembles the courtly paradigm. Another is the fact that her insults are not only tolerated but implicitly lauded. The distortion is in the fact that there is no tangible edifying result—it is difficult to see Louis as an enobled character as an outcome of his passionate suffering.</p>
   <p>The obsessive nature of Louis’s love causes a display of irrational jealousy, insanity, and it makes him view Barrows as an arch rival for Pris, the trophy. It is surely no coincidence that when Pris begins her illicit liaison with Barrows, she changes her name (comically) from Priscilla Rock to Pristine Frauenzimmer, believing, naively, that the surname means “womankind” when, in fact, it is a colloquialism for “streetwalker.” In this detail, we see the courtly model (“womankind” has an archetypal ring to it) distorted, undercut (streetwalker). Imagining her life with Barrows, Louis jumps to the wild conclusion that Pris will go on to bigger and better things, and perhaps even “briefly marrry President Mendoza. He’s been married, what is it, forty-one times already,” after which “every man in the U.S. would want her . . . . I was driving myself insane with these thoughts” (131). Earlier, Louis had asked himself, “What is this sickness?” (110), and we see his jealousy drive him to near madness when he arrives in Seattle to retrieve Pris. “I liked the feeling of being alone . . . about to go out and confront Mr. Sam Barrows with no one to help me. It was like an epic or old western TV play” (§13.136).<a l:href="#n_141" type="note">[141]</a></p>
   <p>A well-recognized aspect of the love triangle, of course, is that it increases the value of the woman when men view themselves as rivals; hence, the courtly model frequently employs this (Lancelot/Arthur/Guinvere or Tristan/Mark/Iseult are the best examples). <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> portrays this in the Louis/ Barrows/Pris triangle. Louis says to himself, “She’s probably twice as beautiful as she was before, now that Barrows has gotten hold of her. And if Barrows competes with me, I’ll wipe him out of existence” (§13.141).<a l:href="#n_142" type="note">[142]</a> And a few pages later, “l‘m going to kill him, I said to myself. I really am. He’s got my girl” (§13.143). After he contacts Barrows and threatens his life, Louis thinks to himself, “The loss of Pris had driven me insane.”(§13.145).</p>
   <p>This occurs commonly in medieval romance; witness the madness and consequences of both Tristan and Lancelot, for instance, in Malory (see, for instance, Book V, Chapters IV and XIV). The jealous, irrational nature of love is so ingrained in Western cultural attitudes that we fully expect people to behave foolishly and sometimes without reason when they have fallen under its influence. In this regard, Louis Rosen is no exception to the rule, even though Pris calls him “old-fashioned” (§10.104) and also states flatly to him, “Haven’t we gotten through the poetry stage long ago?” (§10.107). Whether she intends this to pertain to our culture or as a remark pertaining only to her relationship with Louis is unclear. And, when Louis wants to kiss her chastely on the cheek, Pris berates him: “You’re old. That’s it. You’re part of a dying model of the past” (§10.107). But if Pris can accuse Louis of buying into “old-fashioned” ideas about love, she also seems to know the medieval script of the courtly model. In the aborted (non)love scene in Chapter 10, Pris tells Louis that she had never intended to make love to him, probably to take another stab at his ego: “I was going to defeat you at the final moment. I just wanted to drive you to a pitch of . . . sexual desire and then—” (§10.108) in an effort to explain why she was trying to seduce him in the dark but when he turned on the lights she was fully dressed. And she then tells him, “I expect a lot. I’m idealistic”(§10.109). Though her utterances sound clichéd (and they are, as if she had been reading too many supermarket checkout—line romances), in them Pris demonstrates her understanding of the courtly model of repression and delay—to make Louis desire her, but to avoid granting him her “favors” in order to increase his ardor for her. As Andreas Capellanus (Chretien de Troyes’s contemporary) points out in his <emphasis>Art of Courtly Love,</emphasis> “love” of this sort is always either waxing (before the possession of the love object) or waning (after the beloved has been conquered). “Love is always either decreasing or increasing,” he states (30).</p>
   <p>It would appear that Pris has acquired her role model from her reading of the popular 1950s novel by Herman Wouk, <emphasis>Marjorie Morningstar.</emphasis> Maury Rock blames this book for “wrecking” his daughter:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>That book’. . . gave Pris the idea that she could meet someone rich and famous and handsome. Like you know who. Like Sam K. Barrows. It’s an old-country idea about marriage. Cold-blooded, marrying because it’s to your advantage . . . . When she read that book she began to get calculating about love.</p>
    <text-author>(§11.119)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>Louis believes in the importance of the book. Before he departs for Seattle in an effort to recover Pris, he buys a copy of <emphasis>Marjorie Morningstar.</emphasis> By reading it, he tells us, he hopes “to get more of an insight into Pris” (§12.133). The feudal practice of an aristocratic arranged marriage for economic or political gain has an appeal for Pris, an irony considering the fact that, according to de Rougemont, the rise of chivalric love was an answer to this abusive custom of treating women as chattel (32−34). But Pris seems unaware of this irony, as is made clear by the fact that it is Barrows’ power that Pris finds attractive, that he is an industrial magnate of enormous wealth, even though he is an unscrupulous business man. It matters more to Pris that Barrows is featured on the cover of <emphasis>Look</emphasis> magazine than that he might be a slum landlord. What is significant about Barrows, finally, is that, in Louis’s mind anyway, he functions as the rival in the courtly triangle. Louis himself deems Barrows a worthy rival, however, in that he admires, as does Pris, Barrows’s power.</p>
   <p>Louis’s obsession with Pris reaches its climax when, lured to the apartment of Colleen Nild, Barrows’s assistant, he experiences a powerful hallucination (in the presence of his father and his brother, Chester). This delusion provides Louis the fulfillment he had not received in the previously discussed aborted love scene in the motel room, for here Louis enjoys a physical consummation with Pris. Though his father and Chester try to bring Louis out of this delusion, they fail: “I held Pris against me. And for me, that was all” (§16.179). It is this psychotic episode that causes Louis to be recognized as schizophrenic and results in his entry into Kasanin clinic.</p>
   <p>One question that haunts this reader of <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> has to do with the unconvincing nature of Louis’s love for Pris, for she seems to possess few qualities that would recommend her as such a treasured object of love. Louis himself recognizes her deficiencies, yet to him she remains irresistable: She is cold, calculating, unfeeling, and cruel. He associates her throughout the work with death—a key concept, as we shall see. Furthermore, Pris’s illness, we are told, is permanent. She will never be cured, which then precludes the possibility that Louis’s love will ever be returned, and he knows this. Despite this fact, Louis remains undaunted, continually indulging in fantasies of marriage and sexual satisfaction with Pris. I do not think these contradictions are the result of an ill-conceived novel or of undeveloped characters in it, but represent instead the most profound expression of the courtly model, the paradigm which the Tristan and Iseult legend most cogently represents.</p>
   <p>According to Denis de Rougemont, the Tristan myth glorifies passion, a passion that is ultimately associated with a desire for death, since it can only be satisfied by death. Hence, the <emphasis>liebestod</emphasis> motif so closely associated with it, reaching perhaps its most accentuated form with the German romantics, especially Wagner. I should like to examine closely some of Louis’s own comments regarding Pris and his love for her in an effort to connect it with the mystic passion for death which de Rougemont argues is encoded in the Tristan myth.</p>
   <p>Louis’s love for Pris strikes him inexplicably and suddenly, without explanation. As mentioned previously, Louis’s own description of Pris when he first sees her in Chapter 3 (his memory of her as a child notwithstanding) includes his observation that “she looked . . . like a dance of death creation animated in some weird way” (§3.22), not exactly an appearance that would seem to make one fall hopelessly in love. Despite her insults, Louis’s passion for Pris grows into an obsession, a “sickness” that he cannot shake. He submits to this suffering even though he understands that Pris will never be well; he and Maury have a lengthy discussion about her condition (§3.28−31). Louis says to himself, “What did I do? I asked myself. Fall in love with her? . . . What a woman, what a <emphasis>thing</emphasis> to fall in love with. What terrible fate is in store for me now?” (§12.126). That Louis sees his fate as being inextricably bound up with his love for Pris indicates the degree to which the novel follows the <emphasis>liebestod</emphasis> motif. As de Rougemont states of the Tristan myth, “The myth operates wherever passion is dreamed of as an ideal instead of being feared like a malignant fever; wherever its fatal character is welcomed, invoked, or imagined as a magnificent and desirable disaster . . . it is stronger and more real than happiness, society, or morality”(24). Louis views his love as his fate, and, as previously mentioned, he does not blame Pris for the suffering she causes (§12.127). Furthermore, she is both “life itself, and anti-life, the dead, the cruel, the cutting and rending, and yet also the spirit of motion itself (§12.126). Once again, we see the connection of Pris with death, but this is precisely part of the attraction Louis feels for her. While he maintains his fantasies of marriage to her throughout, he knows deep down that these are only “wild thoughts, all about marrying Pris and killing Sam Barrows” (§12.141).</p>
   <p>Moreover, the fugues he undergoes while he is being treated in Kasanin Clinic are unsuccessful. In his final fugue, Louis even strikes Pris while they are in a supermarket—the only time, he notes, he ever struck a woman—because the clichéd scenes of domestic bliss which he imagines are antithetical to the unspoken but profoundly attractive death urge which really prompts his passion for Pris (§12.204). De Rougemont argues that Tristan and Iseult are in love with love—passion—which is in and of itself a death wish:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>There would be no myth and no romance if Tristan and Iseult were able <emphasis>to say</emphasis> what is the end they are making ready for in the depths-indeed, in the abyss-of their wills. Who would dare admit that he seeks Death and detests offensive Day, that what he longs for with all his being is the annihilation of his being.</p>
    <text-author>(48)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>The power of myth, according to de Rougemont, the need for it, is to express hidden,’ unspeakable truths. So perhaps Louis really knows, albeit unconsciously, that his fantasies of marriage are unrealizable, even undesirable. As de Rougemont remarks of the medieval Tristan, “it is unbelievable that Tristan should ever be in a position to marry Iseult. She typifies the woman a man does not marry; for once she became his wife she would no longer be what she is, and he would no longer love her” (45). The same must be said of the Louis/Pris relationship, as the fugues so pathetically point out: Louis may deceive himself into believing in the domestic bliss he imagines, but Pris refuses finally to conform to this image, even in Louis’s fantasies. She still remains scornful, cold, untouchable. So where does such a supposition leave the reader? What does Louis’s passion for Pris acutally represent? If we examine what he learns during his psychotherapy, and if we consider the implications of the novel’s conclusion, we once again can find parallels to the Tristan myth, even though these are necessarily tailored to conform to Dick’s own idiosyncratic vision.</p>
   <p>First of all, just before Louis’s “breakdown” he ruminates on Pris’ nature. This occurs during a reflective moment in the Seattle bar as he listens to the music of Earl Grant and observes the melancholy Lincoln: “Pris is wild, I thought. Not part of us. Outside somewhere. Pris <emphasis>is</emphasis> pristine in an awful way: all that goes on among and betwen people . . . fails to touch her . . . . I have seen into the <emphasis>other,</emphasis> I said to myself, when I saw Pris. And where am I left now? Waiting only for death” (§16.170). The association of Pris with the yearning for death, and Louis’s awe of her, is made explicit here.</p>
   <p>Once he undergoes therapy, Louis is diagnosed as having the “Magna Mater” type of schozophrenia. He attempts to explain this affliction to Ralf and Julie (attendants of the clinic who meet him at the airport in Kansas City where, it is supposed, he will be cured): “My life is devoted to worshipping Pris as if she were a goddess. I’ve projected her archetype onto the universe; I see nothing but her, everything else to me is unreal . . . it’s all just shadows” (§17.192). Louis insists repeatedly that Pris is “real.” For instance, he confides to Dr. Nisea, “my reality lies entirely outside the world that others experience” (§17.183); and when he at last spots Pris at the clinic, he says to himself, “I’ve found you in actuality, in the real world, the outside world that is not a product of regressive libido or drugs” (§18.200). Finally, it becomes apparent that Louis’s obsession is absolute when, while driving to the airport to depart for Kansas City, he notes that “every woman . . . looked . . . like Pris” for an instant (§17.189). Once again, de Rougemont’s study of the Tristan myth in Western culture is revealing here. He traces the inception of the myth to its Celtic roots, arguing that the dualsim found in the druidic religion is where “Iranian, Gnostic and Hindu myths converge upon the basic religion [Western! of Europe” (63). The concept of woman to the druids “was a being divine and prophetic” (63), and the continuation of de Rougemont’s discussion begins to sound suspiciously similar to Louis’s love for Pris, or rather his “Magna Mater” schizophrenia:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>Woman . . . symbolizes both the other world and the nostalgia which makes us despise earthly joys . . . . The Essylt [Iseult] mentioned in sacred legends as being both ‘an object of contemplation and a mystic vision’ stirred up a yearning for what lies beyond embodied forms. Although she was beautiful and desirable for herself, it was her nature to vanish.</p>
    <text-author>(64)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>Such is Pris’s function is <emphasis>We Can Build You.</emphasis> She instills desire, but at the same time she is incapable of satisfying that desire. Moreover, Louis’s descriptions of her as “other” and his associating her with death clearly do parallel this myth. Iseult is “divine” or, more properly, the passion she inspires is divine because it is a longing for death, a desire to return to the unspeakable state of preexistent bliss, the total annihilation of the self. Pris does not exactly vanish at the end of this novel, but she does banish, leaving Louis in a drift toward death-he can neither free himself of his desire nor can he attain its object, despite the fact that he unconvincingly attempts to persuade himself that he has been healed: Tm well, I said to myself . . . the government healed me” (§18.206).</p>
   <p>No system, of course, can account for this complex novel any more than one can understand the works of other twentieth-century luminaries such as Hemingway and Fitzgerald by observing their use and distortion of the courtly pattern. But Dick employs, I believe, the Tristan myth in particular, which opens up the text to new and interesting interpretive possibilities. Finally, one has to take into consideration each writer’s idiosyncracies, in this case his own distortion or swerve from the courtly model. Dick’s use of the paradigm can be explained in part by an examination of his remarkable comments about Pris and her actual models (with Dick playing the Louis role) found in his work <emphasis>The Dark Haired Girl</emphasis> (written in 1972; published in 1988).</p>
   <p>In this text, Dick puzzles over whether Pris “is someone I actually knew or someone I made up,” arriving at the theory that “I dreamed up Pris out of my head and then fell in love with Nancy [his fourth wife] because she was so much like Pris” (169). He admits that this type of “hateful” and “sick” person is both repellent and attractive to him, confessing that “every time I saw a chick like Pris . . . I headed right at her at full gallop” (169). Because of this penchant for “castrating females,” Dick admitted that after the composition of <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> he continued “writing novel after novel with Pris-like women in them,” citing Rachael Rosen in <emphasis>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</emphasis>? as an example (170). What finally “cured” him of this repetition compulsion (in art, if not in life), he claims, was his meeting of a dark-haired girl who “wasn’t like Pris, wasn’t cruel and cold and calculating and insect-like and intellectually brilliant, but was warm and kind and earnest and tender” (170) and it was she to whom he dedicated <emphasis>We Can Build You.</emphasis><a l:href="#n_143" type="note">[143]</a></p>
   <p>Later in his discussion, Dick refers to Pris’s coldness as “her emotional endless night” (172), an interesting phrase when one considers the close associations of Pris with death as well as de Rougemont’s assertion that in the Tristan legend, “uncreated broad day was but Night” and his reference to Wagner’s Tristan, “who yearns to founder only in order that he may rise again into a Heaven of Light. The ‘Night’ he sings of is Uncreated Day. And his passion is the cult of Eros—the desire that despises Venus even when in the throes of sensuality”(64).</p>
   <p>Dick claims that after he met Kathy Demuelle, to whom he, at least initially, dedicated <emphasis>We Can Build You,</emphasis> he had another model for the dark-haired girl which ended the duplication of the android Pris in his fiction. However, he admits that in life he was still vulnerable to the “destructive women” about whom his analyst had warned him. This was so until he met his fifth wife, Tessa; she managed to lure Dick away from one “Linda” who was in love with someone else. Though Tessa, through her “intellectual brilliance” and “emotional warmth,” was able to break the spell of Linda, Dick confesses, “I still see Linda sometimes . . . but I have become able to restrain myself from rushing ant-like after her to beg, as I formerly did, for forgiveness for not meeting her hostile standards” (177−78). So we find ourselves right back in the cart with Lancelot in Chretien’s romance, only here what happens in art also reflects Dick’s own life, his own predeliction for “the dark-haired girl.” The psychology of courtly love lends itself, as we can see, to this dilemma—it becomes a paradigm of abuse, but abuse willingly endured and eagerly sought.</p>
   <p>In his use of this paradigm, and in his deliberate swerve from its original pattern, we can find an affinity between Dick’s work and those of his twentieth-century American predecessors-Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Steinbeck, and E. A. Robinson, among others. Though each writer uses the courtly love model differently, it is significant that it appears as frequently as it does. <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> is a novel of undeserved neglect because it reveals a dimension of Dick’s artistic ability which was not perhaps afforded the opportunity to reach its fullest expression. The novel indicates that, had circumstances been more kindly disposed toward him, Dick might have become recognized—in his own time and in ours—as an important mainstream novelist in addition to his fame as a SF writer. The mainstream novels remain so far largely unexplored; perhaps with the continuing criticism of his work, these novels will receive a much needed .scrutiny.</p>
   <subtitle>NOTES</subtitle>
   <p>1. Space does not permit me in this study to explore other adaptations of the courtly model found in Dick’s novels. I would, however, like to suggest that the matriarchal system in <emphasis>The Simulacra</emphasis> (1964) resembles a courtly model. In fact, Douglas A. Mackey points this out: “The artists in the novel are as caught up in the general delusion as anyone else . . . . Their obsession is similar to Louis’ with Pris in <emphasis>We Can Build You”</emphasis> (65). Dick himself has remarked on the comparison between Rachel Rosen and Pris: We also see an android named Pris in <emphasis>Do Androids Dream.</emphasis> In <emphasis>A Scanner Darkly</emphasis> (1977), Novalis’s mystic blue flower appears at the end, and we also see the deceptive nature of love when Donna Hawthorne, Bob Arctor’s girlfriend, turns out to be an undercover narcotics agent-another variation on the theme of unrequited love.</p>
   <p>2. One also wonders whether it is mere coincidence that Dick’s daughters are named after two of the most famous courtly ladies in literature—Laura, of Petrarchan fame, and Isolde, Tristan’s beloved. Throughout this chapter I will standardize the various spellings (Isolt, Isolde, Iseult), employing the one de Rougemont uses in his book, Iseult.</p>
   <p>3. See, for instance, numerous episodes in Malory such as those of Pelleas and Ettarre (Book I, Chapter VI), Gareth and Lynette (Book IV), and la Cote Male Tayle (Book V, Chapter III).</p>
   <p>4. Pris is not, in my view, a <emphasis>femme falale;</emphasis> instead, she is more directly indebted to the courtly lady because, as Louis says, she cannot help her destructive impulses, nor does she scheme to ensnare her coterie of admirers. I would argue that the <emphasis>femme fatale</emphasis> of the nineteeth century is based on the classical model of the Sirens or Circe, not the medieval courtly lady.</p>
   <p>5. For an interesting discussion about the relationship between medieval romance and western myths, see Part One of Fraser’s book: “From Cavaliers to Cowboys: Chivalry in History and Imagination.”</p>
   <p>6. In René Girard’s terminology, from <emphasis>Violence and the Sacred</emphasis>, Louis Rosen and Sam Barrows are “mimetic doubles” because they both desire the same object (Pris), thus locking them into a conflict which can only escalate and only culminate in violence—as Louis’s desire to kill Barrows makes perfectly clear. See Girard, Chapter 6 (143−168).</p>
   <p>7. By at least the third DAW Books printing, however, Dick had, characteristically, changed the dedication—to Robert and Ginny Heinlein.</p>

    <p>“What Is This Sickness?”:</p>
    <p>“Schizophrenia” and We Can Build You</p>
    <p>by Gregg Rickman</p>
   </title>
   <p>Written in 1962, but not published in novel form until 1972, <emphasis>We Can Build You, a</emphasis> hybrid literary/SF experiment originally entitled <emphasis>The First In Your Family,</emphasis> is one of Philip K. Dick’s least known, but most interesting, novels. Critical commentary has to date not been kind: Many readers find the book unsatisfactory, particularly in its conclusion, which seems (at least on initial reading) to come rather abruptly.<a l:href="#n_144" type="note">[144]</a> Many critics have been unsympathetic. Kim Stanley Robinson wrote of it as “the epitome of the broken-backed novel in Dick’s work” (<emphasis>The Novels of Philip K. Dick</emphasis> 105). Darko Suvin commented that the book “fizzle[s] out in favor of the Jungian theme of Pris” (“Artifice as Refuge and World View” 93). Patricia Warrick missed “Dick’s usual suspenceful plot that bumps the reader along from one surprise to the next” (<emphasis>Mind in Motion</emphasis> 65−66). Lawrence Sutin felt it an “odd SF/mainstream blend. Rating: 6” (<emphasis>Divine Invasions</emphasis> 299). Of Dick’s other commentators only Douglas Mackey is primarily positive, seeing it as “an experimental novel masquerading as straight science fiction” and thus “confound[ing]” to “those expecting conventional narrative unity” (<emphasis>Philip K. Dick</emphasis> 53).</p>
   <p>Rather than the curiosity most critics have found it to be, <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> is instead one of Dick’s most significant works. It earns this status, in part, as the first of Dick’s novels to find its central fascination in the figure of the human android. While in Dick’s later novels treating this theme-notably <emphasis>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</emphasis> (1968), universally recognized as one of Dick’s most important books—it is Dick’s male protagonists who find themselves wondering at their android qualities, here it is a young woman, Pris Frauenzimmer, who is less “human” than the empathic simulacrum of Abraham Lincoln she helps build. We can in fact gain some idea of <emphasis>We Can Build You’</emphasis>s importance by comparing it with <emphasis>Do Androids Dream,</emphasis> a novel that in some ways reads as its sequel. The two books can, in fact, be thought of almost as twins.<a l:href="#n_145" type="note">[145]</a></p>
   <p>Both novels open with reference to “mood organs” as popular household items, widely used to modify emotions. In <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> the Hammerstein Mood Organ is based on the “brain-mapping” of Penfield, Jacobson and Olds, a direct reference by Dick to the researches of Wilder Penfield and colleagues into the physiological bases of human emotion.<a l:href="#n_146" type="note">[146]</a> In <emphasis>Do Androids Dream</emphasis> the protagonists dial themselves thalamic suppressants, “businesslike professional attitudes,” and “six-hour self-accusatory depressions” on Penfield mood organs that seem to be in every home (§1.10).</p>
   <p>Both novels have as primary characters androids, called, in <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis>, simulacra. In <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> the simulacra we see are all reconstructions of figures from the Civil War era, the two most important of which are an Edwin M. Stanton and an Abraham Lincoln laboriously handcrafted by small-time entrepeneurs, Maury Rock and Louis Rosen, the co-owners of MASA Associates. (Their firm’s name is a pun on both NASA and the word <emphasis>Massa,</emphasis> a Civil War-era reference to slave owning.) Their previous business, electronic organs, has been rendered passé by greater public interest in the mood organs.</p>
   <p>By the time <emphasis>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</emphasis> was written (1966), Dick had moved his concerns from small-time companies like MASA to great corporations manufacturing highly advanced humanoid androids on a large scale. In <emphasis>Do Androids Dream</emphasis> the major corporation is called, in a nod to <emphasis>We Can Build You,</emphasis> the Rosen Association. It is based, like much of the action of <emphasis>We Can Build You,</emphasis> in Seattle. The Rosen androids, a highly developed variety called the Nexus-6, are so human-like that they yearn to pass for and live as humans; they escape from the colony planets where they are employed in hazardous labor for a risky pilgrimage back to earth. While the earth of <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> is recognizable as our own, that of <emphasis>Do Androids Dream</emphasis> is post-apocalyptic, the ruined earth sheltering only a small percentage of its former inhabitants, clustered in the remnants of large cities.</p>
   <p>In <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> the simulacra are avatars of a lost, heroic past; in <emphasis>Do Androids Dream</emphasis> the androids are envoys from a cold, nonhuman future. In <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> the Lincoln simulacrum, at least, is more human than his makers, and like the original is prone to both deep depressions and child-like enthusiasms (for works like <emphasis>Peter Pan</emphasis> and <emphasis>Winnie the Pooh).</emphasis> In <emphasis>Do Androids Dream,</emphasis> by contrast, one of the escaped convicts, Pris, torments a house spider while another android, Rachel Rosen-nominally part of the Rosen family, but in fact its product-kills the protagonist’s, Rick Deckard’s, prize live sheep.</p>
   <p>In <emphasis>Do Androids Dream</emphasis> Rachel has a double, built to the same specifications as she, named Pris. In <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> Pris is the daughter of one of MASA Associates’ business partners, Maury Frauenzimmer, who has changed his last name to Rock; Pris keeps the old last name, which she believes means “womankind.” (Later we learn that it is a German colloquialism for “streetwalker.”) Louis Rosen, meanwhile, whose mounting obsession for Pris is the core of the novel, is the book’s harassed protagonist, an extreme variation on the “little man” characters with which much of Dick’s fiction of the 1960s is populated.</p>
   <p>Louis and his family are, perhaps significantly for a writer who had finished <emphasis>The Man in the High Castle</emphasis> (1962) just a few months earlier, Jewish. Louis’s father is a philosophical old humanist, but his brother is a “special birth person,” a product of the radioactive fallout of the 1950s and 1960s (a liberal political stand by Dick the author). Chester is deformed-his “eyes are set beneath his nose, and his mouth is up where his eyes ought to be” (§2.15)—a visual metaphor for the jumbled state of a multiple personality (a condition <emphasis>which</emphasis> is, as we shall see, an underlying theme of the novel).</p>
   <p>There are radiation-spawned “specials” in <emphasis>Do Androids Dream,</emphasis> too. In that novel’s case, J. R. Isidore-who, like Jack Isidore in Dick’s then-unpublished novel of 1959, <emphasis>Confessions of a Crap Artist</emphasis> (published 1975), is something of an idiot savant. J. R., like his namesake in <emphasis>Confessions,</emphasis> is the moral center of <emphasis>Do Androids Dream,</emphasis> while Rick Deckard, its protagonist, is an android-type killer (bounty hunter of escaped androids) who recovers his humanity in the course of the book. In contrast to both of these, Louis Rosen gradually loses his humanity as <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> progresses, or at least he loses his mind: Merely depressed at the novel’s beginning, he winds up, like Pris, in the Federal Bureau of Mental Health’s Kasanin Clinic, a “schizophrenic.” What pushes both Louis and Rick to the edge is the growing realization that they and the androids/simulacra with which they do business are not that different Both Louis and Rick are driven to this realization by their relationship with an “android”—either, in Rick’s case, the actual android Rachel Rosen, or, in Louis’s case, the android-like Pris Frauenzimmer.</p>
   <p>As <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> opens, Pris has just returned from the Kasanin Clinic, her “schizophrenia” in remission. The clinic’s name is a reference to an authority Dick admired, Louis Kasanin, editor of <emphasis>Language and Thought in Schizophrenia</emphasis> (1944). The names assigned to other FBMH clinics, in the novel’s Chapter 17, are a roll call of psychiatrists whose work Dick knew: Harry Stack Sullivan, Erich Fromm, and Dick’s own therapist of the time. In the world of the novel schizophrenia is a common condition, afflicting at various times one of every nine Americans.<a l:href="#n_147" type="note">[147]</a></p>
   <p>As Dick’s understanding of schizophrenia is central to <emphasis>We Can Build You,</emphasis> it should be elaborated on. Late in the novel Louis Rosen tells his business partner Maury Rock what schizophrenia is like, from the inside: “[a] weakening of attention so that unconscious processes gain mastery and take over the field. They capture awareness, very archaic processes, archetypal, such as non-schizophrenics haven’t had since they were five” (§17:189). Dick here Iinks-not for the first time-schizophrenia and early childhood. In his essay “Schizophrenia and the Book of Changes” (1965), Dick defined schizophrenia as an escape “from the real world into a phantasy one,” allying it with an adolescent failure to achieve “psychosexual maturity,” to be “fully born” into “the koinos kosmos (the shared world)” (1−2).</p>
   <cite>
    <p>What distinguishes schizophrenic existence from that which the rest of us like to imagine we enjoy is the element of time. The schizophrenic is having it all <emphasis>now,</emphasis> whether he wants it or not; the whole can of film has descended on him, whereas we watch it progress frame by frame . . . . Like a person under LSD, the schizophrenic is engulfed in an endless now. It’s not too much fun.</p>
    <text-author>(3)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>Dick went on to link schizophrenia to a state of passive terror:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>This state, not knowing what is going to happen next and therefore having no way of controlling it, is the sine qua non of the unhappy world of the schizophrenic; he is helpless, passive, and instead of doing things, he is done to. Reality happens to him—a sort of perpetual auto accident, going on and on without relief.</p>
    <text-author>(5)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>Dick’s definition of schizophrenia, then, thus links up with his childhood experiences, most notably the violent traumas he suffered at the formative ages of four and five. While Dick on occasion identified himself as a schizophrenic—for example, his admission here that he himself was a “partial schizophrenic” (9)—it should be made clear that Philip K. Dick was not a schizophrenic. Other, better theories exist to explain his experiences: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dissociative identity disorder (DID) (in earlier psychiatric literature, multiple personality disorder [MPD]), or temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). He suffered none of the key symptoms of schizophrenia such as an inability to think logically or in causal order, was afflicted by many symptoms unknown in schizophrenia (such as amnesia), and possessed such distinctly nonschizophrenic traits as personal magnetism, proper affect, high suggestibility, and a sense of humor.</p>
   <p>It is, however, certainly true that Dick often wrote and spoke about schizophrenia, and frequently in terms of his own experiences. The personal history of one of the other of <emphasis>We Can Build You’s</emphasis> two central figures who suffers attacks of schizophrenia (as Dick understood it), Pris Frauenzimmer, includes many of Dick’s own childhood and adolescent experiences, including attacks of agoraphobia and an inability to eat in public (see my <emphasis>To the High Castle</emphasis> 65−66).</p>
   <p>As Pris is the novel’s primary representative of what Dick understood as schizophrenia, a closer look at this “diagnosis” is in order. Dick’s analysis of Pris indicates, in fact, a major confusion about what schizophrenia is, at least as it is now understood. Here, as elsewhere in his work, Dick contrasts the “high affect” personality (manic? hysteric? epileptic?) with the “low affect” of schizophrenia, mixing it later with the “low affect” of the schizoid personality. But schizoid personality disorder is not schizophrenia; it’s not a psychosis at all, but a personality disorder related to borderline personality disorder and also to sociopathy. The affectlessness of the two states are similar, but the cognitive and perceptual elements are not.</p>
   <p>Elsewhere in the book, though, Dick does the opposite and contrasts the “high affect” of schizophrenia with the coldness of the simulacra. Here Dick confuses schizophrenia with mania, as in manic depression. (To add to the confusion, acute paranoid schizophrenics sometimes show high affect, but only rage and fear, rather than any positive or empathic emotions. Over time, acute paranoia usually will degenerate into emotional stupor.) In fact, Pris is given a jumble of inconsistent diagnoses: “Schizoid by ten, compulsive-obsessive neurotic by thirteen, full-blown schizophrenic by seventeen” (§8.73). What it all sounds like is not, in fact, schizophrenia, but instead multiple personality disorder.</p>
   <p>Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is a condition in which an affectless alter self is quite common: the emotionless spawn of traumatic early abuse. Dick wrote of this alter self as “schizophrenic” in a psychological novel like <emphasis>We Can Build You,</emphasis> and as the “android” in much of his published science fiction: an analogy made between a psychological condition he observed first hand and the machine men of the science fiction he read as a boy. Letting alone his own self-identification as “schizophrenic,” Dick’s aunt was diagnosed as a “catatonic schizophrenic” in the 1940s, and he referred to his mother as “a cold schizoid” in an interview <emphasis>(To the High Castle</emphasis> 3). The psychology of the 1940s, with its misunderstanding of schizophrenia as induced by genetic heritage or familial stress, is to blame here for Dick’s misdiagnoses: The women were more likely victims, like Philip Dick, of his abusive grandfather (their father), E. G. Kindred.<a l:href="#n_148" type="note">[148]</a></p>
   <p>The androids of Dick’s SF, then, are not the compassionate machines of an Isaac Asimov; rather, Dick’s SF is full of such fearful images as Spence Oldham, the unknowing humanoid bomb of “Imposter” (1953), or Keith Pellig, the android political assassin “operated” by different personalities in <emphasis>Solar Lottery</emphasis> (1955). Dick’s distinction between “android” behavior and the “authentically human” in such essays as “Man, Android, and Machine” (1976) is also relevant: “A human being without the proper empathy or feeling is the same as an android built so as to lack it.”<a l:href="#n_149" type="note">[149]</a> <emphasis>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</emphasis> foregrounds a “schizophenic” struggle between “android” and “human”: Rick Deckard’s bounty hunting violently fictionalizing a war between android and human.</p>
   <p><emphasis>We Can Build You,</emphasis> by contrast, presents the same conflict as domestic tragedy. At the center of the novel is the horrified attraction, mounting as the novel progresses to obsession, Louis Rosen—the “human”—feels for Pris, the “android.” From the book’s opening Louis is at once drawn to and repelled by her.</p>
   <p>Louis is one of Dick’s most interesting protagonists. Like the author at the time of the book’s writing, Louis is thirty-three years old, but he reads as much older—in Pris’s view, worn out; she is moved by his sense of dread to emotionally dissect him. It is to Dr. Milt Horstowski, one in a series of smug, dislikable psychiatrists in Dick’s <emphasis>oeuvre,</emphasis> that Louis first suggests that he himself is a machine. Unfortunately for Louis, he can’t get this new idea out of his mind, and before long is carrying two contradictory thoughts in his head at the same time: that he’s a simulacrum and that the notion is “drivel” (§6.48). Late in the book, en route to his diagnosis as “‘phrenic,” he takes some standard psychological tests and fails them. The Benjamin Proverb Test measures how well one interprets such standard sayings as “A rolling stone gathers no moss” to see if one agrees with the social consensus for their meaning; Louis fails when his version is different. “I showed a formal thinking impairment” (§17.185).</p>
   <p>In <emphasis>Do Androids Dream</emphasis> Rick Deckard tests the androids he has been assigned to terminate by giving them a variant of these tests. This test is now said to determine “empathy,” the quality nonhumans lack no matter how intelligent and driven they are. Deckard’s crisis comes when he begins to lose track of who is human and who is not; at one point he is driven to wonder if the “distinction between authentic living humans and humanoid constructs” is a real one (§12.97).</p>
   <p>Louis’s crisis first comes to a head when, in Chapter 8, he encounters the simulacrum Pris and her associates have built of Abraham Lincoln. He faints, passing out cold. Why? As an icon in our culture, and in Dick’s, Lincoln carries enormous resonance. Dick admired Lincoln, writing in 1975 “I remember reading Sandburg’s <emphasis>Abraham Lincoln,</emphasis> and the enormous impression it made on me, especially the part about Lincoln’s death and funeral. It was about the first time in my adult life that I ever really cried.”<a l:href="#n_150" type="note">[150]</a> The novel makes clear that Dick was well aware of Lincoln’s mythic stature in American culture.</p>
   <p>For example, consider the novel’s Civil War motif. What would a Civil War represent to a dissociated personality? War between one’s alter selves. It is the Edwin M. Stanton, an executive alter type in the constellation of DID alters, who is built first; Stanton resents the construction of his former boss, Lincoln, the humble martyr who bound the Union together. Lincoln also symbolizes the Great Emancipator; his paternal relationship to black people (pointedly established in Chapter 9) pays off when his desire to hear a black singer precipitates the novel’s climax (as we will see). Even more crucially, Lincoln is established as a Christ figure, albeit a most reluctant one. In a brilliant set piece, Louis witnesses the Lincoln’s “rebirth,” glimpsing the thing’s “dreadful fear . . . fear as absolute existence: the basis of its life” (§7.63). Lincoln is like an alter plucked from unconsciousness. Watching him, Louis concludes that “the basis of life” is the “[a]bsolute <emphasis>dread”</emphasis> the Lincoln feels: “Paralysing dread so great as to produce apathy. Yet the Lincoln stirred, rose out of this. Why? Because it had to. Movement, action, were implied by the extensiveness of the dread. The state, by its own nature, could not be endured” (§7.63). Later on in the book Louis and Lincoln become friendly, Louis concluding that the Lincoln is a manic depressive like himself, perhaps even his double. So it is when Louis encounters Christ/Father Abraham/the Emancipator/the Savior of the Union/a fellow apprehender of absolute dread/his double, he passes out of consciousness. There’s room for only one alter of their type in their shared consciousness.</p>
   <p>Later, at a loss over his passion for Pris, he thinks <emphasis>“If anybody can help me, Abraham Lincoln can”</emphasis> (§14.150). The sentence is both hilarious and poignant. He goes to him for help, but alas the Lincoln simulacrum proves to be as frail as he. Louis’s tactless mention of Lincoln’s legendary lost love Ann Rutledge plunges the Lincoln into deepest gloom. For all this, however, Louis, having read of the historical Lincoln’s bouts of near insanity, has decided that “Lincoln was exactly like me. I might have been reading my own biography” (§14.153). Louis switches his diagnosis of the Lincoln from “manic-depressive” to “the introverted psychosis . . . schizophrenia” (§14.153). (In the novel, where “one out of nine” Americans has suffered schizophrenia, the current president is a recovered schizophrenic himself.) Yet Louis is forced to reconsider: “Lincoln had taken everything hard. He might have been remote, but he was not dead emotionally; quite the contrary. So he was the opposite of Pris, of the cold schizoid type. Grief, emotional empathy, were written on his face. He fully felt the sorrows of the war, every single death” (§14.153). Lincoln was “innately good and warm and human”; he could be gotten to, and suffer, while Pris, on the other hand, was remote and detached. “Her main fear, I could see, was of closeness to other people” (§14.154).</p>
   <p>All of this is useful in defining schizophrenia as Dick used the term. As we have seen, Dick confused various illnesses in his depiction of the disease. More centrally to a DID thesis, we have here two selves: the human (Lincoln, paradoxically an android), and the “schizoid” (Pris, paradoxically Lincoln’s builder). The former is warm, the latter cold. Louis’s personality is more like Lincoln’s, but his love for Pris points to a desire for psychic union. For in the course of the novel Pris is explicitly described as both “life” itself and as antilife incarnate. In a sense, then, a union with Pris would represent a unity striven for by various of Dick’s characters-Hamilton and Laws, for example, achieve this unity (by agreeing to go into business together) at the end of <emphasis>Eye in the Sky</emphasis> (1957). Who is Pris? She is both a young woman and psychic android. In <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> Pris expresses empathy for insects, including spiders, tormented and killed by men (§7.58−59). The Pris of <emphasis>Do Androids Dream</emphasis>, meanwhile, pulls a spider apart. The Pris of <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> has different sides to her—for instance a “gullible” one (§8.72). She serves a variety of contradictory functions, representing a variety of contradictory states: DID.</p>
   <p>The turning point and perhaps the heart of <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> comes in Chapter 10, with the most important of a series of horrifying, humiliating, rending conversations between Louis and Pris, largely to do with sex.<a l:href="#n_151" type="note">[151]</a> The couple’s failure to connect here, on an emotional and on a sexual level, condemns both of them, ultimately, to schizophrenia and the Kasanin clinic.</p>
   <p>Louis and Pris, like most of Dick’s couples, defy traditional male-female imagery. The men are soft, “hysterical,” the women rigid and hard in many of Dick’s novels of the period from <emphasis>Confessions of a Crap Artist</emphasis> through <emphasis>The Man in the High Castle</emphasis> (1962), <emphasis>Clans of the Alphane Moon</emphasis> (1964), to <emphasis>Do Androids Dream</emphasis> and <emphasis>Ubik</emphasis> (1969). A rigid Pris is a “rigid prick.” She’s male, he’s not. But at the same time Pris’s youth is emphasized (as in the couple’s dialogue about her underdevelopment in Chapter 10: she just started wearing a bra a year ago, etc.). She’s presented, in short, as just past puberty. Yet the couple’s failure to couple is acrid, deadly. (The parallel scene in <emphasis>Do Androids Dream,</emphasis> between Rick Deckard and another android with the “childlike” body of a “girl,” Rachel Rosen, is equally deadly.)</p>
   <p>And the failure is ultimately more Louis’s fault than Pris’s. The turning point to Louis, as to why things go so badly, comes when Pris switches off the Lincoln simulacrum. The “killing” of that positive, saintly, more-human-than-they-are figure—the good father, the good God, the better side of Louis himself—devastates Louis: “We’re better but not healed. Because we weren’t well in the first place . . . . <emphasis>What is this sickness!”</emphasis> (§10.110).</p>
   <p>As a result of this failure, Pris winds up in the arms of multimillionaire businessman Sam K. Barrows, Dick’s prescient anticipation of a rapacious 1980s tycoon (he even jogs for his health). In <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> both Barrows and his lawyer, Dave Blunk, joke-on their first meeting-about Pris being her father’s mistress. (Barrows, who will eventually make her his mistress, also wonders immediately if she’s a simulacrum.) As they joke, they raise the spectre of “statutory rape”—not of incest (§9.84). There is some evidence, however, that the recurring references to “statutory rape” in Dick’s work is a code phrase by which Dick could speak of incest, its causes and consequences. In <emphasis>We Can Build You,</emphasis> Barrows, the big capitalist, is engaged in trying to take over and absorb the small business of which Pris and her father are a part. He fails in this objective, but he wins a partial victory when he, for a while, “absorbs” Pris. (In <emphasis>The Man Who Japed</emphasis> [1956] the state religion of Morec is explicitly referred to as “absorbing” human souls.) In <emphasis>Radio Free Albemuth</emphasis>, written in 1976, the young “Friends of the American People” agent intends to blackmail the novel’s Philip Dick character into becoming an informer; she claims to be seventeen when we find she is, in fact, older, and thus “legal.” Much is made of Pris’s ability to call in “the police” and “the world at large” if Louis has sex with her in <emphasis>We Can Build You.</emphasis> There are similar references in <emphasis>Mary and the Giant</emphasis> (written 1955) and <emphasis>Now Wait for Last Year</emphasis> (written in 1963). The key theme is, again, underage sex—a reference, again, to Dick’s own childhood traumas.</p>
   <p>It is only after Pris is gone that Louis, who seemed to hate her more than anything else in their previous encounters, can admit and sink into a great obsessional love for her. His sexual jealousy ultimately sends Louis into madness, into thoughts of using his gun; maybe on her, maybe on Barrows, maybe on himself. A mad trip to Seattle follows, Louis ping-ponging back and forth between recurring threats on Barrows, his yearnings to join him, and thoughts of suicide.<a l:href="#n_152" type="note">[152]</a></p>
   <p>In the throes of his madness, Louis feels, once again, like a machine. Reaching Barrows on the phone, he screams to him about the industrialists “rape” of Pris, although remaining detached, in the back of his mind “calm, sardonic” (§13.144). Barrows agrees to let Pris go. Louis exults that his dissociated actions have paid off. Pris outwits him, though, refusing to return to Oregon. That night, Louis, Lincoln, and Barrows’s party, including Pris, all meet at a Seattle cafe to hear a black blues singer. Lincoln insists on going; he wants to hear the singer, whose name is given as the “legendary Earl Grant” (§15.160). In 1962 a singer and organist named Earl Grant (1931−1970) was popular; he sang ballads, including the blues standards Dick has him sing. Dick takes advantage of Grant’s existence to incorporate his grandfather’s name, as he knew it, into his novel. (Dick’s family, interviewed, remembered E. G. Kindred’s given names as “Earl Grant.” Sam Umland’s researches have in fact revealed his first name as Evarestus.)<a l:href="#n_153" type="note">[153]</a></p>
   <p>As Earl Grant sings, the novel’s sixteenth chapter unfolds, a chapter pulling together in an astonishing tour de force the book’s major themes. There may be some significance to the chapter’s very numbering: Lincoln was the sixteenth president. The chapter begins with Louis joking to Sam K. Barrows that his company has built a George Washington simulacrum, “the Father of Our Country.” After this possible reference to Dick’s own father-whose absence left him at the mercy of his putative abuser, his maternal grandfather, E. G. Kindred-Pris launches into a denunciation of Barrows, telling him and everyone else “You screwed me before witnesses” (§16.164). The witnesses, however, are all in the employ of Barrows-his grinning lawyer Dave Blunk, the obese Coleen Nild-joke names, sketchy characters, but possibly stand-ins for the other family members who “witnessed” young Phil’s abuse and, in his view, did nothing. In terms similar to two other of Dick’s “statutory rape” victims (Mary Anne Reynolds in <emphasis>Mary and the Giant</emphasis>, Mary Reineke in <emphasis>Now Wait for Last Year),</emphasis> Pris tells Barrows, “You’re a dirty, ageing, middle-aged man who likes to peep up girl’s skirts” who ought to be in prison (§16.164). The question is inescapable: Why would Pris call the vigorous Barrows, identified earlier in the book as a “young millionaire,” “old and flaccid” and an “old fairy” if Barrows were not a stand-in, here, for the author’s aged male rapist?</p>
   <p>At this point, to intimidate Louis, Barrows produces a crudely made John Wilkes Booth simulacrum, not handsomely designed, like the Lincoln simulacrum, but instead crude and pieced together. The Booth is a puppet assassin, akin to the android assassin Keith Pellig of <emphasis>Solar Lottery.</emphasis> Louis tests the Booth to see if it, like the historical Booth, knows any Shakespeare or any Latin, but it does not. The thing is, however, fitted with a killer instinct. Sam has trumped Louis: The message Louis gets is cooperate, or the Lincoln dies. Pris, however, is angered that the Booth had been built behind her back and appalled that her creation might be destroyed. She kills the thing with the heel of her high-heeled shoe, to the shock of both Barrows and Louis. This scene is very powerful and richly imaged: As Pris kills the Booth her eyes are “shining and wet, her mouth a thin contorted line.” The hands of the Booth, meanwhile, “beat jerkily in the air; its feet drummed on the floor . . . . An inner wind convulsed it” (§16.168). One thinks of Dick’s own android-like “CNS (central nervous-system) stalls.” as described by Tessa Dick.<a l:href="#n_154" type="note">[154]</a></p>
   <p>Pris leaves. The men debate over which of them has lost their battle. Louis’s tongue is thick and clings to the side of his mouth. Earl Grant reappears, to sing about “grasshoppers” in his pillow and “crickets” in his meal, insect (incest?) metaphors involving beds and eating.<a l:href="#n_155" type="note">[155]</a> Louis wonders,</p>
   <cite>
    <p>Was he singing to me? Had he seen me sitting there . . . known how I felt? It was an old song and sad. Maybe he saw me, maybe not. I couldn’t tell, but it seemed so.</p>
    <p>Pris is wild, I thought. Not a part of us. Outside somewhere. Pris <emphasis>is</emphasis> pristine and in an awful way: all that goes on and among people, all that we have here, fails to touch her. When one looks at her, one sees back into the farthest past; one sees us as we started out, a million . . . years ago . . . .</p>
    <p>The song which Earl Grant was singing; that was one of the ways of taming, of making us over, modifying us again and again in countless slow ways. The Creator was still at work, still moulding what in most of us remained soft. Not so with Pris; there was no more moulding and shaping with her, not even by Him.</p>
    <p>I have seen into the <emphasis>other,</emphasis> I said to myself, when I saw Pris. (§16.170)</p>
   </cite>
   <p>In this amazing passage Earl Grant—the singer who shares a name with his abusive grandfather—is equated to God, a god who sings a song of molestation. Yet he moulds what is “soft” in us: what is vulnerable and .shows emotion. Pris, though, is beyond his moulding-Pris, the novel’s metaphor for the “schizoid” after-product of abuse, Dick’s android personality. She dates into “the farthest past,” what was for Philip Dick the remote precincts of his childhood, but becomes in his fiction eternal time, time beyond memory. This is the inflation of personal time to God’s time-what will become a key Dickian metaphor in his later, post-Valis experience work.</p>
   <p>This passage just quoted is followed by a reverie by Louis, imagining Lincoln’s death procession, a reverie with images of a coffin guarded by soldiers which recalls MASA Associates’ earlier plans to build Civil War picket babysitters. It recalls as well the toys who stand guard in early stories like “The Little Movement” (1952) and possibly recalls the toy soldiers of Philip Dick’s youth.<a l:href="#n_156" type="note">[156]</a></p>
   <p>Louis then asks the Lincoln to free-associate about his childhood depressions. The Lincoln “cleared its throat” (recalling Dick’s own difficulties in swallowing, a lifelong physical problem of his)<a l:href="#n_157" type="note">[157]</a> and sends him to Connie Nild’s apartment on the hunch that Pris is there. Instead, he finds his father and brother. A harrowing depiction of Louis’s final descent into madness follows, Louis imagining he’s making love to Pris as his family looks on disapprovingly. In an increasingly dream-like scene Barrows, who is also there, makes comments about Pris’s child-like underdevelopment. Louis can’t prevent these people from observing him; he wretchedly says, ‘“I can’t shut them out; they’re right here on top of us. We’ll never be away from them, we’ll never be alone” (§16.176). Dick presents in fiction a dissociative’s torrent of voices, alter selves commenting on his life. Pris, meanwhile, has become a projection of what Louis wants her to be, a warm mother figure. (Which means Louis is making love to his mother.) Referring to her role in creating the Lincoln, Pris asks, “‘Could I be your mother too?’” and regrets her causing the “death” of the Booth simulacrum (§16.177). As Louis’s mother, Pris now has life and death power over him. In the flash of her teeth he sees “a smile of great suffering and sorrow “-Lincoln’s. Pris has become his mother, his father, and also himself, even as his real father comments that Louis has returned “to the original source that we’ve all turned away from” (§16.178).</p>
   <p>The book’s final chapters are in no sense a letdown. They deal with the aftermath of Louis’s “schizophrenic” breakdown, which the episode with Pris marks. His doctor, Horstowski, tests him by playing “a tape of voices which mumbled at a distance” for him; Louis perceives every voice as hostile, just as in 1974 Dick himself would hear hostile voices saying “You’re no good” and “Dick the prick” (see Lawrence Sutin, <emphasis>Divine Invasions</emphasis> 218).</p>
   <p>Louis is then picked up by “the Bureau”—the Federal Bureau of Mental Health. Louis wonders if he will still care for Pris as he had before: “How will I feel about you then? Will I remember you? And if I do, will I still care about you as I do now?” (§17.182). One thinks of Winston and Julia in Orwell’s <emphasis>1984.</emphasis> Later, the FBMH people who escort Louis to the Kasanin Clinic in Kansas City remind one of the eager, clean-cut “Friends of the American People”/political police of <emphasis>Radio Free Albemuth.</emphasis> This is another link between the “Bureau” and political repression as depicted in the later book. The novel’s America, it would appear, is a therapeutic dictatorship where the Federal Bureau of Mental Health can pick people up at random and consign them to an institution. The constant references to “the Bureau” and its power make it sound a lot like another federal bureau, the FBI, which played a similar function in Dick’s life. Any resistance is covert, ironic; mad at his psychiatrist, he calls him a “Government employee” (§13.139). Dr. Shedd, who treats Louis at Kasanin, speaks like an astronaut: “That’s an a-okay prognostic sign” (§18.194).</p>
   <p>Yet on the whole Dick is kind and polite to the FBMH psychiatrists who diagnose and treat Louis. Dr. Ragland Nisea, who diagnoses Louis as suffering from the “Magna Mater” form of schizophrenia, is portrayed sympathetically. Nisea’s discussion of the “Magna Mater” (in Chapter 17) is very informative, linking as it does Dick’s thought, his actual circumstances, and his fiction: it shows Dick as influenced by such sources as Robert Graves, James McDonald Frazer, and Erich Neumann with its references to “pre-patriarchal” goddess religions, study of which has been taken up again recently by feminist anthropologists like Rianne Eisler <emphasis>(The Chalice and the Blade).</emphasis> Dick also references Jung’s archetypal theories here: theories, it can be argued, that merely serve to give a mythic gloss to states of clinical dissociation.</p>
   <p>In the grip of his madness, every woman Louis sees on the street looks like Pris; here we see the replication illusion of “Upon the Dull Earth” (1954) as well as <emphasis>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</emphasis> (1965). Like the Rick of that story Louis has found his world taken over by his unconscious self, his “anima . . . projected outwards, on to the cosmos.” Louis accepts this; he says later in the chapter that Pris is his “Great Mother” and that he is “devoted to worshipping Pris as if she were a goddess. I’ve projected her archetype onto the universe; I see nothing but her, everything else to me is unreal” (§17.192).</p>
   <p>Given the novel’s discussion of the “Magna Mater,” it is suggestive indeed that there are so many links in <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> between Pris and Dick’s notion (described in my <emphasis>To the High Castle</emphasis> and <emphasis>Variable Man)</emphasis> of his own mother. Earlier, in Chapter 14, Louis had occasion to compare Lincoln and Pris, Lincoln’s creator—and hence, in a sense, Lincoln’s mother. Earlier yet, the Edwin M. Stanton simulacrum, in a speech which Louis wonders might have been written by Pris and inserted into the Stanton in “some bitter, weird irony of hers,” lamented the “calculating” side of Pris’s character and her attachment to the “cast-off rationalisms” of the past (§6.54). Dick may have been thinking here of how his mother’s attachment to behavioristic psychiatry blighted his youth. Finally, the name “Pris,” given in a word-association test, makes Louis Rosen think of “milk” (§5.46).</p>
   <p>This returns us to the theme of child abuse. It is, in fact, not Dick’s own inferred molestation by his grandfather that sheds light on the explicit themes (“schizophrenia,” the android self projected onto a young girl) of <emphasis>We Can Build You,</emphasis> but Dick’s mother’s putative molestation by the same source. The recurring incest theme in Dick’s work (coded, as we have seen, as the theme of older men having relations with much younger women-see <emphasis>Mary and the Giant</emphasis> and <emphasis>Our Friends from Frolix 8</emphasis> [1970] in addition to the titles already given) is directed toward a whole series of “schizophrenic”/“android” women of whom Pris Frauenzimmer is simply the best example in Dick’s <emphasis>oeuvre</emphasis>—the most developed as a character and the most contextualized in her relationships. Given that Dick identified his mother as a “schizoid” herself, cannot Pris (and her coevals) be seen as Dorothy Kindred Dick’s fictional avatar, in book after book after book? “I’ve projected her archetype onto the universe; I see nothing but her.”</p>
   <p>There are eighteen chapters in <emphasis>We Can Build You,</emphasis> as many as years Pris is old. The book’s final chapter takes place at Kasanin. Louis’s therapy includes treatment with hallucinogenic drugs, which he had read about by 1962 but not yet experienced himself. The “regression” scenes which follow strongly resemble those of Dick’s late story “Frozen Journey” (1980) as well as the domestic scenes at the end of <emphasis>Mary and the Giant</emphasis> and others of Dick’s literary novels. They are. like Dick’s other “literary” work, very fine and remind us of how much was lost when Dick’s “career” as a mainstream novelist bore no fruit. As with the patient in “Frozen Journey” the patient here, Louis, loses track of which fugue he’s in—episodes blend together, and he relives many of them. He imagines Pris is his wife. As his wife, Pris berates him for talking back to the radio and asks him if he has amnesia. Both of these moments point to Dick’s domestic life circa 1962 containing dissociative elements that would emerge, more famously, later, during Dick’s Valis experience of 1974. When Louis recovers enough of himself to hit back at Pris, verbally and literally, then he’s considered cured and is discharged—as a malingerer! The sarcasm could not be more bitter. Throughout these scenes Louis is an almost sickeningly model patient, with lines like “You certainly have my permission” (§18.196). Given what we know about Dick’s own life, it would be hard to find a more ruefully bitter conclusion than his comment, at the very end of the book, “the Government healed me” (§18.206).</p>
   <p>When, at the end of the novel, Louis is discharged from Kasanin, leaving Pris behind, he comments bitterly that she is “without a thought for me or for any other thing” (§18.206). However, this seems to me equally bitter and like many of Louis’s comments full of self-pity and anger; she had indeed expressed concern for him at their last meeting just a page earlier. Thus the book ends bluntly-too abruptly for most. Yet any attempt to extend Louis’s story further seems pointless. Like Pris, Louis seems locked in an endless loop which will take him back and forth into insanity for the rest of his life. For, in Dick’s view, there is nowhere else to go.</p>
   <p>At the beginning of this chapter, <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> was identified as a key novel of Dick’s for its early development of the “android” theme. We can now see that it has greater importance yet: as perhaps Dick’s most thorough fictional exploration of the literalized “family romance” he found so tormenting and, as is dramatized in <emphasis>We Can Build You’s</emphasis> climax, so inescapable.</p>

   <subtitle>NOTES</subtitle>
   <p>1. Ted White, the SF editor who uncovered the unsold novel in 1969 and first printed it in <emphasis>Amazing</emphasis> (as “A. Lincoln, Simulacrum”), felt moved to write an extra final chapter, a chapter which Dick removed when the book was finally published.</p>
   <p>2. When comparing the two, it is useful to remember that at the time that Dick wrote <emphasis>Do Androids Dream, We Can Build You-wiittcn</emphasis> in 1962-had been rejected by every publisher who had seen it, and thus Dick felt freer to borrow from it than he might have otherwise.</p>
   <p>3. Anthony Wolk discusses this point further in Chapter 6.</p>
   <p>4. Kasanin’s book also contains the source article for the Benjamin Proverb Test, which Dick employs in <emphasis>We Can Build You,</emphasis> and, with some alterations, is reworks into the Voight-Kampf empathy test of <emphasis>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ?</emphasis></p>

The first of these conversations had already occurred in Chapter 4; Pris’s unprovoked accusations there included claims that Louis was homosexual, an “anal type,” and that he’s “queer for old men” (aspersions which all harken back to Dick’s own putative molestation by the aged E. G. Kindred).</p>
   <p>9. Seattle was, in fact, the city to which Dick drove his then wife for an abortion shortly before <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> was written. Given Dick’s later strong public opposition to abortion—as expressed in his short story “The Pre-Persons” (1974)—and the divided feelings it seems to have left him with at the time, Dick’s use of Seattle as the site for Louis’s breakdown is no doubt significant.</p>

    <p>“Man Everywhere in Chains”:</p>
    <p>Dick, Rousseau, and The Penultimate Truth</p>
    <p>by Merritt Abrash</p>
   </title>
   <p>Philip K. Dick’s 1964 novel <emphasis>The Penultimate Truth</emphasis> is routinely dismissed as a minor work, worth no more than passing mention.<a l:href="#n_158" type="note">[158]</a> Dick himself is on record with little more than “certainly not a major book but it has a couple of good ideas in it”—but the only “good idea” he identifies is merely a plot device (Gregg Rickman, <emphasis>Philip K. Dick: In His Own Words</emphasis> 65). On first reading the novel does seem a bit of a potboiler, especially compared with the major works of the same period—<emphasis>Martian Time-Slip</emphasis> (1964), <emphasis>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</emphasis> (1965), <emphasis>Dr. Bloodmoney</emphasis> (1965). It ranks high in sheer SF inventiveness, but serious deficiencies include an excess of subplots, a confusing and unconvincing major character, and some convoluted and ultimately absurd time travel gimmickry.<a l:href="#n_159" type="note">[159]</a></p>
   <p>Nevertheless, <emphasis>The Penultimate Truth</emphasis> is notable for the attention devoted to social and political setting. Dick rarely goes very deeply into the social and political dynamics of his frequently bizarre fictional worlds, but so much of this novel concerns such matters, and the implications are so weighty, that it is fair to speculate that in this case the social science aspects were intended to be more than mere scaffolding for the plot. And, in fact, one clue strongly suggests that the true substance of the novel is not at all the plot—actions and developments stemming from an initial situation—but the initial situation itself. It is possible, on this line of interpretation, that the guiding concept behind that situation is the concretization of abstractions and metaphors, both familiar and lesser known, in the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.</p>
   <p>The clue referred to above is a reference (the only one in any of Dick’s novels) to Rousseau by name: “Your lives are incomplete [a character thinks |, in the sense that Rousseau had meant when he talked of man having been born in one condition, born brought into the light free, and everywhere was now in chains” (§8.74). Rousseau’s lines, opening Chapter 1 of the <emphasis>Social Contract</emphasis>, are among the most famous in Western thought: “Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains. One thinks himself the master of others, and still remains a greater slave than they”(5). Interpretations are legion; it is one of the great unresolvable controversies in political theory. Obviously Rousseau did not mean “in chains” literally, but just as obviously he was referring to a humanity-wide condition of deprivation and restraint. <emphasis>The Penultimate Truth</emphasis> describes such a condition and relates it to “Man is born free” as a particular historical development.</p>
   <p>The “situation” at the heart of this novel is that the vast majority of humanity lives uncomfortably underground in the unquestioning but false belief that this is both a practical necessity and a patriotic duty, while a tiny elite lives in luxury on the earth’s surface, expropriating most of what is produced by the others. Thus stated, this sounds like a variation on Plato’s Allegory of the Cave—a philosophical metaphor illustrating an abstract point. But Dick is not merely “illustrating” a point: Instead, he embodies it in a novel which, except for its placement in the future, is realistic in all those respects which have come to characterize the modern novel. In particular, the situation of humanity in <emphasis>The Penultimate Truth</emphasis> has a plausible history of concrete events.</p>
   <p>In the year 2009, war broke out on Mars between the colonies of earth’s Eastern and Western blocs. It took a year for the war to spread to earth, by which time both sides had moved their entire populations underground into hundreds of thousands of “tanks,” complete small communities geared entirely to maximum war production in attached undergound factories. The actual fighting was to be done on the surface by “leadies”—sophisticated robots which were the main product manufactured by the “tankers.”</p>
   <p>For two years vast battles were fought between the armies of leadies. The only humans on the surface were upper-level (no pun intended) military and administrative personnel, along with media specialists vital for sending information and propaganda via television to the tanks—the only communication, since tankers obviously could not come to the surface because of radioactivity. It gradually occurred to the leaders on both sides that the apparently unwinnable war was no longer to anyone’s advantage, and at the same time on each side advanced leadies capable of strategic thinking came to the logical conclusion that the interests of their masters—the above-ground elite—would be best served by ending the fighting but not letting the tankers know this. Then the elites could divide the land and good things of the world among themselves, while leadies carry out reconstruction and afterward serve as mechanical slaves, and would continue to be produced and repaired by the tankers under the delusion that there was still a war going on.</p>
   <p>The fighting was accordingly ended, and the tankers were henceforth deceived by ingenious television simulations providing seeming evidence of a purported see-saw progress of the war. To inspire them in their endless privations, a “Protector” addresses them periodically with calm determination, spiritual reassurance, and evident concern for their welfare-actually, the Protector is a simulacrum (modeled on Eisenhower) whose speeches and movements are programmed by the media specialists. Finally, to make sure the tankers never discover the actual state of affairs, they are warned of hideous plagues raging on the war-ravaged surface.</p>
   <p>At the time the novel opens, the war has been over for thirteen years. The elite live like feudal lords, each with his or her “demesne” and retinues of leadies. Complete stability has been achieved: The elite own the earth, while the tankers think they are fulfilling their patriotic duty and are thankful to be safe from the plagues and not losing lives in the fighting. No end is in sight: Occasionally a city is shown falling and the tankers’ production quotas are increased. The Protector’s television pronouncements are a source of comfort and strength, adjusted to the condition of morale as reported by political commissioners in the tanks. Matters are handled identically in the Western and Eastern blocs, except that, of course, the progress of the war is presented differently.</p>
   <p>It is to the tankers that Dick refers when he speaks of Rousseau: Men “born in one condition, born brought into the light free, and everywhere . . . now in chains.” This commits Dick to a particular interpretation of Rousseau’s words: Men are born with a birthright of a share in the good things of the earth, and the tankers “were entitled to something they did not have; they were the victims of robbers. Theft had been committed against all the millions of them, and there had been no moral or legal remedy all these years” (§8.74−75).</p>
   <p>This is not in itself particularly profound: Governments are deceiving their peoples and condemning them to cramped, worry-filled lives. It is hardly a revelation that small elites take advantage of emergencies to tighten control over whatever portion of humanity they can affect. But Dick’s novelistic realization of Rousseau’s plaint is more complex than this.</p>
   <p>In the first place, the peoples on both sides had egged on their governments to fight. True, they had been subjected for years to intense propaganda rooted in radical distortions of World War II, conveyed by brilliantly faked documentaries (different for each bloc) long since accepted as historical fact. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the elites, quite apart from their own responsibility, are satisfying popular passions. To one of the Protector’s leading speech writers, the norms of popular behavior make the massive deception in which he participates a virtual duty: If the tankers were allowed to return to the surface, the world of vast demesnes “would become a densely populated civilization once more, not quite as before the war, but close enough. Roads would reappear. Cities. And-ultimately there would be another war” (§7.61).</p>
   <p>This line of thought comes straight out of Rousseau’s <emphasis>Second Discourse—</emphasis>population increase produces property in land and other goods, followed by conflict and the agreement to establish a government empowered to use force to protect the right of individual possession. It is civilization that sows the seeds of war (and of practically all other undesirable human interactions-see the <emphasis>First Discourse</emphasis> as well on this subject). The elite may indeed take this point of view merely as a rationale (Dick uses this word), but if the Devil can quote Scripture for his purpose, there is nothing to prevent the elite from quoting Rousseau for theirs. Man has been deliberately put in chains? To be sure—but circumstances demanded it (the two years of real war), and in any case civilization has at least been defused by stabilizing it at a regressed stage which promises indefinitely prolonged peace among nations and between classes.</p>
   <p>This leads directly to the second subtle elaboration Dick’s concretization builds on Rousseau. The consummate deceptions of the mass of humanity arouse instant indignation in the reader, but on reflection it is not clear on what basis the indignation can be sustained. Governmental deception, detached from consequences, is not unequivocally immoral in any major Western political theory except Rousseau’s. Even in Lockean thought, the issue is not morality as such, but the role of government vis-à-vis natural rights. Governmental deception can indeed promote violations of the latter, but the deception itself is not such a violation-there is no natural right not to be deceived. In fact, a government which deceives its people for the purpose of furthering their natural rights should cause no complaints among consistent Lockeans, just as a deception which helps satisfy the criteria of utility (however defined) can justifiably distress utilitarians only to the extent that they apply standards extraneous to their professed political logic.</p>
   <p>The same considerations apply, <emphasis>mutatis mutandis</emphasis>, to all theories of popular sovereignty which rely upon an electoral relationship between government and people—that is, all theories which proclaim popular sovereignty operative as long as a government can be replaced through electoral process (or—<emphasis>vide</emphasis> Locke—should that process be closed down, by consequently legitimated revolution). Rousseau, however, insists that authentic popular sovereignty demands full and correct information for the citizens in their collective capacity of sovereign. A government which withholds or falsifies information is striking at the people’s ability to govern themselves, and this cannot be morally compensated by any amount of practical benefit. Hence the <emphasis>Social Contract</emphasis> is uncompromising on the issue of full information, and it is within a framework of Rousseau’s ideas and no other that the governmental policies in <emphasis>The Penultimate Truth</emphasis>—for which Dick feels obvious repugnance—can be condemned regardless of motives or consequences.</p>
   <p>In any terms but Rousseau’s, in fact, the two great states in the novel do not betray the primary functions for which they were established. Each protects the lives of its citizens-not only in the ambiguous form of organizing people and resources against a hostile “they,” but in devising and utilizing the leadies which enable a war to be fought without any loss of life. Each sees to it that all citizens are fed. (The successive penalties faced by a tank that does not meet production quotas—a small reduction in food rations and the drafting of one man in ten—are no more tyrannical as exercises of sovereignty than imposing rations or drafting citizens in the first place. The tankers are even allowed to appeal such measures through a formal legal process, although we have good reason to doubt its impartial functioning.)</p>
   <p>Since the tankers are grateful to the government for protecting their lives (a justified gratitude as long as the war was actually being fought) and accept the shortcomings of their existence as a necessity given the known circumstances, a charge of injustice—or, <emphasis>a fortiori,</emphasis> robbery—has validity only to outsiders favored with a perspective which the victims have no way of sharing. Rousseau alone provides’ a means for surmounting this dilemma, by introducing an internal standard which cannot be nullified even by benevolent government motives or socially desirable consequences: the general will.</p>
   <p>Rousseau’s concept of the general will has proved even more troublesome than the words about men being in chains. Dick’s accomplishment, intentional or not, is to give the elusive concept of general will a concrete embodiment within <emphasis>The Penultimate Truth’s</emphasis> fictional situation. Tankers and elite alike agree that it would be right and just for human beings to live where they had been born, on “the surface of a world . . . with its air and sunlight and hills, its oceans, its streams, its colors and textures, its very smells” (§8.74). One of the elite confesses that “they had made the world into their deer park at the expense of the millions of tankers below; it was wrong and they knew it and they felt guilt” (§7.63). This human right is accepted as so self-evident a proposition that one of the Protector’s programmed speeches even acknowledges to the tankers that “the abridgement of your reality, the deprivation of your rightful life” is an inequity that must eventually be ended (§8.75). “The people are never wrong, but often deceived” is another renowned formulation from the <emphasis>Social Contract</emphasis>, but it is hard to imagine even the most intense propaganda deceiving the people about this issue; their conviction truly manifests a general will (<emphasis>Contract</emphasis> 25−26).<a l:href="#n_160" type="note">[160]</a></p>
   <p>But, just as Rousseau warned, the general will can be undercut by the existence of particular wills. The elite are unwilling to take any steps toward rectifying the injustice they acknowledge because, as Adams, the speech writer who eventually does break ranks, notes, “they were selfish” (§7.63). The general will is remote from specific measures and effects, whereas the elite’s particular will brings immediate material advantages. When a shockingly devious plot is devised to imprison a powerful maverick who is actively sympathetic toward the tankers, Adams actually nerves himself to warn the victim anonymously but gives up at the first hint of difficulty: “Can’t. he realized; can’t ever do it . . . the bonds are too strong. The ties; they’re too long, old, tight. I have introjected them and now they act as a part of me; they live here inside, within me. Lifelong. Now and now on” (§17.142).</p>
   <p>Secure in the psychological grip and material seduction of their particular will, enjoying the benefits of being slavemasters without the crudities of human slaveowning, the elite would seem to have created a veritable earthly paradise for themselves. But Rousseau assures us this cannot be so: “One thinks himself the master of others, and still remains a greater slave than they.” This is indeed the case in the novel. The elite suffer from debilitating guilt-enough “to make their late evenings a thrashing agony of loneliness, emptiness, and their nights impossible” (§7.63). They are always tired from the unrelenting work necessary to supply and administer the tankers and, on the part of the media people, to maintain a flawless deception. It is clear, in fact, that Adams does not enjoy his blessings in the sense of satisfaction leaving one’s heart at ease. There is an odd sense of the vast material benefits serving as compensation for the strain of being “the master of others.”</p>
   <p>The most significant disability attached to being a “master,” however, is on quite a different level. Near the end of the novel, Adams sees no way to avoid death at the hands of a hostile elite faction except by going down into a tank. He is warned about the crowded conditions, including sharing of bathrooms:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>“Good enough,” Adams said. He would agree to anything . . . . And-he would be more than willing to share the bathroom . . . . He would not endure it; he would thrive. Because it would make up for the loneliness of his years as dominus of his vast, silent, forest-surrounded demesne.</p>
    <text-author>(§27.222−23)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>In other words, what the elite lack, in every case where we observe them, is community-exactly what Rousseau posits as the necessary condition for the fulfilment of an individual’s humanity. Adams’s remark brings to the fore what is implicit throughout the novel: Life in the tanks, its discomforts made tolerable by the sense of common purpose, has a humanity-enhancing communal quality, whereas the elite in their separate demesnes have regressed far back toward the state of nature. They are surrounded by leadies (a master-slave relationship which precludes a genuine community) and overloaded with property which they must protect against their armed fellows. Boundary disputes between demesnes are chronic, with each dominus possessing an army of leadies to patrol and threaten; the sole arbiter of such disputes, ironically enough, is a council of extremely sophisticated leadies-somewhat as if Hobbes’s presocial humans had had access to computers to judge their conflicts.</p>
   <p>The framework of <emphasis>The Penultimate Truth</emphasis>, then, can be understood as an historically explicable organization of human life which manifests a dynamic realization of Rousseau’s enigmatic opening of the <emphasis>Social Contract.</emphasis> When this is perceived, a tapestry of other themes from Rousseau becomes visible throughout the novel. The plot against the maverick who wants to release the tankers involves sending futuristic weapon prototypes back 600 years in a time-scoop. Both time-scoop and weapons were unexpectedly found by a Cherokee Indian leader, known in the time of the novel as David Lantano, who has used them to intervene purposefully in subsequent history. It is his present intention to overthrow the elite, declare the war ended, and restore the tankers to their rightful heritage. Strangely enough, those characters who learn his secret deeply mistrust him, and at the end of the book, although Lantano has in fact taken over from the elite, the novel’s tanker hero considers him an enemy. Lantano’s motives and role are confusing to follow, but to a surprising degree they become explicable through reference to the <emphasis>Social Contract.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Rousseau postulated a “Legislator”—a necessity in his terms in the evolution of an ideal community-who is uniquely powerful, far sighted, and free from self-interest. Lantano has an obvious affinity with such a Legislator: armed with irresistible weapons and able to visit and hence know the future, he possesses the equivalent of the wisdom the Legislator needs. “It would take gods to give men laws,” writes Rousseau in the <emphasis>Social Contract</emphasis> (35), and Lantano’s infallible foresight and ability to intervene at crucial points over the course of centuries certainly fill the bill. Even more suggestive of Lantano’s Legislator role is Rousseau’s further remark that the Legislator has to be “working in one century, to be able to enjoy in the next” (<emphasis>Contract</emphasis> 35). Only with time travel can this be literally true-another example of Dick’s transformation of abstraction and metaphor into a simulation of reality.</p>
   <p>But if Lantano intends to undo the colossal injustice against the mass of humanity in the tanks, why does the tanker hero turn against him? No direct explanation is proffered in the novel, but again the <emphasis>Social Contract</emphasis> contains the clue: “He who has command over the laws ought not any more to have it over men” (36). The Legislator’s power over fundamental social organization is so great that he must not be additionally allowed to exercise direct power over the people. Lantano, however, intends to rule; he has descended from his god-like Legislator’s role into the violent and corrupting struggle for actual power. Once embarked on this course, not only must he lose his moral authority in Rousseau’s view, but he will be perceived by the tankers as no less manipulative of the people than the previous elite. The elite and Lantano become indistinguishable in their insistence upon imposing grand designs for personal power on humanity; only the means differ.</p>
   <p>The question is why Dick should have brought the god-like Legislator into play for the ultimate purpose of dismissing him as unworthy. What is there about Lantano which might account both for Dick’s fascination and disillusionment with him? It can hardly be without significance that Lantano is a fifteenth-century American Indian. In the terminology of Rousseau’s <emphasis>Second Discourse,</emphasis> this identifies him as a savage, with the more specific meaning of a mentality reflecting the “happiest and most durable epoch . . . the least subject to revolution, the best for man . . . the veritable prime of the world” (151). In short, the noble savage recognizes the evils and corruptions of civilization for what they are-until at the last moment Lantano too becomes corrupted, playing a partisan role and seeking to exercise the power which, in his capacity as Legislator, he is supposed to bestow upon the people. If Dick takes the surprising tack of portraying this particular Legislator as ultimately dangerous, it is most likely because the author wants the tankers—with whom his sympathies obviously lie—to seize their own destiny rather than having it handed to them by a superior being, no matter how benevolent.</p>
   <p>It is ironic that the sentiment which leads the masses in <emphasis>The Penultimate Truth</emphasis> to accept their loss of birthright voluntarily is one for which Rousseau has the highest praise: patriotism. True, love of superpower is quantitatively and perhaps qualitatively different from love of community as Rousseau idealized it, but at bottom they reflect the same impulse. The tankers are wholeheartedly devoted to serving their country and grateful that this can be done without direct risk to their lives. Based on the information they receive, their duty is self-evident.</p>
   <p>But of course that information is totally controlled, and the consequence is a continual and unresisted expropriation of the mass of humanity by a tiny elite. Such an achievement is beyond any form of control over material objects or processes-police, elections, means of production, and so on. It is uniquely the result of control over information, specifically control over media.</p>
   <p>Dick expends much space and ingenuity in describing the media techniques which helped bring on the war by inspiring hatred and suspicion between the blocs, and which now keep the tankers convinced that the war continues to rage. These techniques are so skillful and innovative, and they so brilliantly combine technology and the creative imagination, that they emerge as a perfect exemplar of the “development of the sciences and arts,” which, Rousseau writes in the <emphasis>First Discourse,</emphasis> has “added nothing to our true felicity (and) corrupted our morals” (62). “Our souls have been corrupted in proportion to the advancement of our sciences and arts towards perfection” (39), he asserts-and, in fact, the only apparent fruit of the amazing refinement of the science and art of media in <emphasis>The Penultimate Truth</emphasis> is perfect propaganda. Adams, ruminating over the time-scoop, contrasts the constructive uses to which it might have been put with its only actual use, as a weapon in power struggles among the elite (§ 13.110−11): “We are, Adams realized, a cursed race. Genesis is right: there is a stigma on us, a mark. Because only a cursed, marked, flawed species would use its discoveries as we are using them.”</p>
   <p>And so the media, quintessential product of the progress of the sciences and arts, serve as the means of the utter corruption of those who direct them and the alienation from their birthright of those at whom they are directed. Nowhere in <emphasis>The Penultimate Truth</emphasis> do the two <emphasis>Discourses</emphasis> and the <emphasis>Social Contract</emphasis> mesh more logically and effectively than in Dick’s treatment of this theme.</p>
   <p>The conceptual understructure of <emphasis>The Penultimate Truth</emphasis> deviates from Rousseau’s outlook in one important respect. It is clear from the <emphasis>Second Discourse</emphasis> that man is in chains through neither accident nor intent, but because the seeds of the degeneration in his condition are embedded in the very act of establishing human society. Power and property, inseparable from human association in the post-savage state, necessarily corrode freedom.<a l:href="#n_161" type="note">[161]</a></p>
   <p>So far there is nothing to which Dick would take exception, but Rousseau goes one cheerless step further: The truth about this retrogression and its causes is powerless to inspire humanity to change its ways.</p>
   <cite>
    <p>Truth has almost never amounted to anything in the world, because men act more from passion than intelligence, and while they approve the good, they do what is evil . . . . It is one of the things that has discouraged me most during my short literary career to feel that even if I had all the talents I needed I should be vainly attacking fatal errors, and that even if I could be victorious, things would not go any better.<a l:href="#n_162" type="note">[162]</a></p>
   </cite>
   <p>In contrast to this despair, the tanker protagonist in <emphasis>The Penultimate Truth</emphasis> warns Adams that ‘ “It’s over . . . . Over for you personally and over for all of them.’ <emphasis>Because,</emphasis> he said to himself, <emphasis>I’m going to tell</emphasis> [the tankers] <emphasis>the truth”</emphasis> (§29.236). When Adams, trying to protect the elite against reprisals, insists that “I know . . . we can come up with something,” the tanker responds (§29.238), ‘“I know you can, too.’ Except for that one thing . . . . You’re not going to. Because we will not allow you.” The novel ends with this promise that truth will effect a profound change for the better in the debased human condition.<a l:href="#n_163" type="note">[163]</a></p>
   <p>Such an expectation receives sweeping expression in a peculiar episode earlier in the novel. In a speech written for the Protector to deliver to the tankers, Lantano uses the image of a nocturnal bird, flying in through one window of a warm, animated castle hall, enjoying it for a moment, and then flying out another window into endless darkness.<a l:href="#n_164" type="note">[164]</a> The speech commiserates with the tankers whose lives lack even “this short flight through the lighted hall,” and assures them that “this iniquity will be abolished . . . . And even the memory, even the <emphasis>idea</emphasis> of us who are up here now, will forever vanish . . . . ‘And you will not be able to curse us because you will not even recall that we existed‘“(§8.75−76).<a l:href="#n_165" type="note">[165]</a></p>
   <p>There is, in other words, not any true OUT door from the human condition, at least not through human efforts in this life. And Dick chooses to have Lantano, who believes otherwise, rejected. Perhaps the deviation from Rousseau is more apparent than real.</p>
   <p>Regardless of how one wishes to interpret <emphasis>The Penultimate Truth</emphasis> (or even if one believes that it is too slight a work to justify interpretation at all), a critical question remains to be answered. The “truth” in the title undoubtedly refers to the actual state of affairs on the earth’s surface. But this is only the penultimate truth. Then what is the ultimate truth? Rousseau is of no apparent use here, nor is there any persuasive internal evidence. But since the “truth” revealed in the novel is complete and unambiguous within the fictional context, Dick would hardly have referred to it as penultimate unless it bore on a more significant one in some other context.</p>
   <p>Speculation on this subject, lacking any grounding in the novel itself or knowledge of the author’s intentions, is reduced to a matter of opinion, no doubt colored by the social and political outlook of whoever is doing the speculating. I am attracted to the notion that for Dick, the ultimate truth is that the novel is a metaphor for the way <emphasis>our</emphasis> world actually works. In the novel, the truth—the penultimate one of the title-is, briefly, that an elite is exploiting the vast majority of humanity under cover of false information about the condition of the physical world and human affairs. Thus abstracted from plot specifics, this “truth” lends itself to a comprehensive metaphor.</p>
   <p>The great mass of humanity in our world is not constrained underground making objects which go directly to a political and technical elite, but human beings spend their lives creating wealth-much of which is expropriated, in accordance with the law, by those who control capital. The surface of the earth is not ruled out of bounds by purported plagues, but vast tracts are declared off limits to the many through either state power claiming military necessity or the power of capital backed by property law. The media do not often produce visually false images of the world and human events, but every refinement of the arts and sciences is utilized for highly selective enhancement or depreciation in the interests of commercial or ideological persuasion.</p>
   <p>A metaphor of such scope and density makes <emphasis>The Penultimate Truth</emphasis> the weightiest social and political statement among Dick’s novels. It would, of course, be entirely fitting for his mentor in such matters to be Rousseau, urgently concerned with heart rather than head, with pity-analogous to Dick’s treasured “empathy”-rather than calculation, and with society as a stage for human character rather than a mechanism to be valued for its own sake. These parallels hold regardless of provable influence by the earlier author on the later.<a l:href="#n_166" type="note">[166]</a></p>
   <p>One further consequence of interpreting <emphasis>The Penultimate Truth</emphasis> as a concretization of abstraction and metaphors drawn from Rousseau: The novel must be labeled a failure inasmuch as the allegorical aspect is so thoroughly blended into the fictional story that readers, almost without exception, fail to detect it. And it is fair to ask whether so obscure an embodiment of specific social and political ideas may not result from a reader imposing ideological constructs of his or her own rather than deliberate allegorizing by the author. But besides Dick’s direct reference to Rousseau, an underlying kinship is demonstrated by the former’s concern, throughout his body of work, with humanity’s existential chains and the misuses of the arts and sciences on the level of public policy. The two writers share the melancholy conclusion that humanity takes wrong turns because it is humanity, visionary social contracts and upbeat novelistic endings notwithstanding.</p>

   <subtitle>NOTES</subtitle>
   <p>1. There have been few serious commentaries on the novel. The most recent—and unusually respectful—is by a critic from outside the SF field: Richard Bernstein, “The Electric Dreams of Philip K. Dick,” <emphasis>The New York Times Book Review</emphasis> (Nov. 3, 1991).</p>
   <p>2. The novel was written under contract, at great speed, and simultaneously with <emphasis>The Zap Gun</emphasis> (which also suffers from subplotitis and careless writing). Perhaps because of this pressure, Dick cannibalized earlier short stories—“The Defenders,” “The Unreconstructed M,” and “Adjustment Team”—for hardware, concepts, and even the name David Lantano.</p>
   <p>3. These pages are from Chapter III of Book II, the tantalizing heart of Rousseau’s formulations (or, some would insist, nonformulation) of the concept of the general will.</p>
   <p>4. Rousseau’s purpose in formulating his particular version of the social contract was precisely to make possible a reconciliation between society-by definition restrictive—and individual freedom as it presumably existed in the state of nature. The patent impracticability of his recommendation (leaving aside questions of its validity as theory) testifies to the inextricable association of “chains” with civilization.</p>
   <p>5. Rousseau to Tscharner, April 29, 1762. Qtd. in Hendel, <emphasis>Citizen of Geneva (225).</emphasis></p>
   <p>6. Much earlier, Adams thinks, “Ye shall know the truth . . . and by this thou shalt enslave” (§5.43). But this refers to the elite knowing the truth but using it untruthfully.</p>
   <p>7. Lantano’s speech states that this image, as a metaphor of every human’s earthly life, converted a pagan king in the British Isles to Christianity. This obviously refers to Edwin, Anglican king of Deira and Bernica, who was baptized at York in 627−628 A.D. after a meeting of the king’s council, at which an unnamed nobleman gave a speech incorporating the image of the bird and the mead hall. However, the moral of the speech at York was rather different than Lantano’s: since we know nothing of the darkness before or after the flight through the hall, a doctrine that promises reliable information should be accepted. See H. P. R. Finberg, <emphasis>The Formation of England</emphasis> (42).</p>
   <p>8. The notion of past history vanishing utterly from memory climaxed the manuscript (but not the version as delivered) of Dick’s speech at the Second International Festival of Science Fiction, Metz, France, September 24, 1977: “When the work of restoration is completed, we will not even remember the tyrannies, the cruel barbarisms of the earth we inhabited; . . . the vast body of pain and grief and loss and disappointment within us will be expunged as if it had never been.” Philip K. Dick, “If You Find This World Bad, You Should See Some of the Others,” <emphasis>Philip K. Dick Society Newsletter</emphasis> 27 (August 1991), 39.</p>
   <p>9. Although Dick had to have enough familiarity with Rousseau to refer accurately and appropriately to the opening of <emphasis>The Social Contract,</emphasis> all other speculations in this chapter about Rousseau’s influence on <emphasis>The Penultimate Truth</emphasis> rest entirely on inference. Inquiries to some of Dick’s acquaintances have not revealed evidence of any particular knowledge or interest in Rousseau on his part. I am convinced, however, that he would not have written a book so fertile in social and political imagery, and with such striking philosophical digressions, without a thorough understanding of Rousseau—to whom he does, after all, make a critical reference.</p>

    <p>Two Cases of Conscience:</p>
    <p>Loyalty and Race in The “Crack in Space” and “Counter-Clock World”</p>
    <p>by Jake Jakaitis</p>
   </title>
   <p>In his <emphasis>Postmodernism, Or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism,</emphasis><a l:href="#n_167" type="note">[167]</a> Fredric Jameson examines Philip K. Dick’s <emphasis>Time Out of Joint</emphasis> (1959) as a “trope of the future anterior,” an examination of present experiences as historical past that simultaneously creates “a pretext for complacency with our own historical present” and evokes “the expression of deep, unconscious, collective fears about our social life and its tendencies.” Dick’s future in that novel, his 1997, becomes significant for Jameson principally as a history of Dick’s own reading present—the autonomy of the small town in Eisenhower’s America—set against the terrible future of a protagonist who, longing for the benign comfort of his 1950s childhood, participates unconsciously in sustaining the delusional reality constructed for him by his wartime government. For Jameson, then, Dick’s “brutal transformation of a realistic representation of [his] present . . . into a memory and a reconstruction” that conceals a threatening reality beneath the deceptively benign appearance of the everyday evokes a terror “deeply rooted in class comfort and privilege” and governed by the fear of “proletarianization” (279−286). In this analysis, the opposition between appearance and reality that informs Dick’s novels is reconstituted as a function of class. Dick’s paranoid vision becomes tied to middle-class fears of future decline and loss of comfort and privileges set against an idealization of a more comforting, but threatened, present.</p>
   <p>While Jameson’s analysis functions convincingly within its context, and perhaps even convincingly details the forces at work in <emphasis>Time Out of Joint,</emphasis> like much of the criticism of Dick’s early novels, it ignores issues central both to Dick’s early work and to his neglected novels of the middle 1960s. <emphasis>Time Out of Joint’s</emphasis> Ragle, through his withdrawal into a comforting past that re-presents Dick’s historical present as a site of complacency, may indeed reflect class-based collective fears about possible futures, but Jameson’s analysis—like Peter Fitting’s earlier, influential commentary on the “reality problem” in five of Dick’s novels<a l:href="#n_168" type="note">[168]</a>—fails to directly engage specific conflicts of conscience that inform early novels like <emphasis>Solar Lottery</emphasis> (1955) and <emphasis>Eye in the Sky</emphasis> (1957) and carry through to <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> (1966) and <emphasis>Counter-Clock World</emphasis> (1967). Implicitly, Jameson and Fitting both acknowledge the role of conflicting loyalties in their respective discussions of class-based fears and the ideological constitution of illusory realities. Neither critic, however, examines in any detail the problematics of personal and public loyalties in an era of loyalty oaths and cold war patriotism, although Fitting does briefly discuss <emphasis>Eye in the Sky’</emphasis>s Charley McFeyffe as “a caricatural portrait of Senator Joe McCarthy” (97). Also conspicuously absent from Fitting’s analysis is discussion of the inflection of loyalty issues through the interracial relationship of Jack Hamilton and Bill Laws. Fitting does mention Laws as “a black-someone who in the context of the 1950s was for all practical purposes without franchise” (97) at the very end of his commentary on <emphasis>Eye in the Sky.</emphasis> However, race as a pervasive issue in the novel’s address to reality construction is not one of Fitting’s concerns.</p>
   <p>In fact, despite Dick’s own commentaries on his self-conscious use of race in the early novels, his foregrounding of racial issues at key moments of <emphasis>Eye in the Sky,</emphasis> and his focus on race in both <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> and <emphasis>Counter-Clock World,</emphasis> to rny knowledge very little has been written about issues of loyalty and race in his work. My intention, then, is to identify Dick’s early concern with race by citing his own comments and through a review of <emphasis>Solar Lottery</emphasis> and <emphasis>Eye in the Sky,</emphasis> and then to investigate loyalty and race as interdependent cases of conscience marking Dick’s struggle with conflicting private visions and public realities, with personal and political loyalties. In pursuing this approach, I hope to expose <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> and <emphasis>Counter-Clock World</emphasis> as symbolic acts enacting and attempting to resolve through narratives real social contradictions on both personal and broad cultural levels.<a l:href="#n_169" type="note">[169]</a></p>
   <p>Dick’s personal commitment to racial issues in the 1950s and his somewhat ambiguous relations with African-Americans are not difficult to document. In <emphasis>To the High Castle,</emphasis> Gregg Rickman recounts Dicks struggle to publish <emphasis>Mary and the Giant,</emphasis> which Dick first completed during the same period (1954−1955) as <emphasis>Solar Lottery</emphasis> and <emphasis>Eye in the Sky</emphasis>.<a l:href="#n_170" type="note">[170]</a> Rickman cites a June 1955 letter from Edwin Fadiman, Jr., an editor at Messner Publications who asked Dick to delete a positive ending to the novel in which Mary settles with Paul Nitz, who in the early manuscript is “a black cripple.” Fadiman asks Dick either to make Nitz “white,” or to make him “the sort of muscular, potent Negro who gives white girls a secret sexual kick” (308). While Dick did rewrite the novel, eliminating the interracial happy ending, his initial version of <emphasis>Mary and the Giant,</emphasis> seen only through Fadiman’s comment on a no longer extant manuscript, exposes an early interest in racial issues, and his refusal to depict an African−American Nitz on Fadiman’s terms reveals a resistance to exploitative racial stereotyping. The author’s interest in race relations can further be traced through other comments presented in the Rickman biography and interviews. Two should suffice to sustain the point.</p>
   <p>In 1936, at the age of seven, Dick was sent to Countryside School in Silver Springs, Maryland, a boarding school for children with behavioral disorders. While there, he suffered from “globus hysteria,” the inability to swallow, which Dick defined as a “grief syndrome” (Gregg Rickman, <emphasis>To the High Castle</emphasis> 5). Freud, of course, defined this hysterical syndrome as the result of one’s inability to swallow an insult, a physical manifestation of an emotional offense. The anger Dick maintained toward his mother, Dorothy, as a result of this offense, of her decision to send him “away to a boarding school so she could go out in the evenings with her friends” manifested itself not only in his globus hysteria, but in his bonding with “the black people who managed the kitchen.” In Dick’s version, the “white folks” of the school would force him to sit all day before food that he couldn’t swallow, but the “black people would wave me into the kitchen and say ‘You come in here with us.’ And that’s one reason I like black people so much I mean they, the black people could tell that I wanted to eat but couldn’t eat. They knew I wasn’t being perverse” (5). In memory, then, if not in the reality of his young experience,<a l:href="#n_171" type="note">[171]</a> he conceives of “black people” as sources of comfort, as havens against the rigid authority of “white folks.” This conception extends to his memories of Lula, the African-American housekeeper who provided him with a “loving” and “warm atmosphere” when Dick was a “latchkey child” in Washington, D.C., and perhaps even to his decision, according to Anne Dick, to write in Martin Luther King, Jr. for president in the 1960 national election <emphasis>(To the High Castle</emphasis> 80, 347).</p>
   <p>The second relevant comment on race appears in the section of <emphasis>In His Own Words (IHOW)</emphasis><a l:href="#n_172" type="note">[172]</a> designated “An Old Black Man.” In the September 30, 1981 interview with Rickman, Dick associates his experiences in Berkeley in the mid-1950s with elements of <emphasis>Solar Lottery</emphasis> and <emphasis>Eye in the Sky,</emphasis> while ultimately connecting these novels to an interest in racial justice. Dick claims that he made <emphasis>Solar Lottery’</emphasis>s Captain Groves—the pilot of the spaceship searching for the flame disc and the prophet, John Preston—an African-American as an affront to Robert Heinlein, whom Dick viewed as enacting a “caste system with a descending order of intelligence, with the blacks at the bottom” (134). He then shifts the commentary to the end of <emphasis>Eye in the Sky,</emphasis> where he conceives of the business partnership established between white Jack Hamilton and African-American Bill Laws as a progressive move in 1956, one comparable to depicting “interracial marriage” (134). It is almost as if the Laws/Hamilton partnership substitutes for the Mary/Nitz one that Fadiman excised from <emphasis>Mary and the Giant.</emphasis> But Dick’s discussion of race does not stop there. He next describes an African-American chauffeur who, during the same period in Berkeley, taught him how to drive.<a l:href="#n_173" type="note">[173]</a> This unnamed man spent “months” teaching Dick to drive, accepted no payment, and refused first to sit in the front seat when Kleo Dick was in the car and then to enter the car at all if Kleo were present because “he couldn’t stand the stress of being in the same car with a white woman” (135). After receiving his driver’s license, Dick invited the man to his home for a celebration beer, but he refused to enter, insisting on sitting on the porch instead. Later, Dick describes defending the chauffeur’s elderly father against a paperboy whom Dick believed was aiming papers at the man while throwing them rather hard (135). While Kleo was unable to confirm these details for Rickman’s account in <emphasis>To the High Castle,</emphasis> and while we cannot fully verify the accounts of Dick’s boarding school and other encounters with African-Americans, they remain relevant to the current analysis, for Dick’s reconstruction of these events through memory and his association of them with self-consciously enacted strategies in his novels remain the relevant issues here.</p>
   <p>Philip K. Dick himself connects these personal issues to political and broad cultural ones in the same Rickman interview when, discussing <emphasis>Eye in the Sky</emphasis> and accusations that he is a Marxist, he calls for both personal and authorial moral responsibility in the face of an objectionable authority. Objecting to claims by Thomas Disch and others that he was a Marxist science fiction writer, Dick asserts that the MOREC dictatorship in <emphasis>The Man Who Japed</emphasis> (1956) was an attack on “that block ward thing in China” and connects this anti-Communist stance to his parallel attack on “the McCarthy witch hunts” and “the totalitarian state,” which he considers “the paradigm of evil.”<a l:href="#n_174" type="note">[174]</a> These comments, in defense of his claim that he is not a Marxist, lead to a belief in dissent whenever we know that “dissent is regarded as treason. . . . At that point, a really moral person, once he notices that trend, of the equating of dissent and treason, has a moral obligation to oppose the authorities” (<emphasis>IHOW </emphasis>129−131). This conflation of political and moral visions in an acceptance of an anticapitalist stance but a denial of Marxist or Communist sympathies leads quickly to Dick’s comments on the African-American chauffeur and on race in <emphasis>Solar Lottery</emphasis> and <emphasis>Eye in the Sky</emphasis> cited earlier. Not only are political and moral vision conflated here, so are Marxist and Communist sympathies, and Dick’s sense of moral justice seems tightly bound to his feelings of loyalty to African-Americans and to issues of racial justice. These ambiguities, in my view, serve to illuminate the ambiguous address to loyalty in Dick’s early novels and the failure of moral vision, not only in <emphasis>Solar Lottery</emphasis> and the two 1960s novels in question here, but also in <emphasis>Eye in the Sky.</emphasis> An examination of two cases of racial conscience in <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> and <emphasis>Counter-Clock World,</emphasis> then, requires a detour through Dick’s address to loyalty in the former two novels.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Solar Lottery’s</emphasis> Ted Benteley exists in a loyalty trap. Dismissed from his job as a biochemist for the industrial firm Oiseau-Hill because “unexplained fires” have decimated the industry, Benteley must descend to the level of the “unks,” the unclassified workers living in housing projects and poverty, take his chance with “the bottle—the socialized instrument of chance” that governs the lottery, or immediately sign a new fealty oath with another employer. It is the year 2203, and the economy is governed by planned obsolescence and the destruction of unsaleable goods to maintain the economy, slaves dying and sweating in alien atmospheres so that the elite can have exotic fruits and intoxicating beverages, and impoverished workers, “unks,” whose choices are to accept labor camps or live in poverty hoping that a random twitch of the bottle will elevate them to Quizmaster. The political is governed by the position of Quizmaster and the twitches of the bottle, which determine who becomes and remains Quizmaster, the autocratic power governing the planet. Benteley decides not to risk the lottery and to sign an oath of fealty with Reese Verrick, the current Quizmaster. He conceives of himself as an average man in an average life in a society whose laws he wants to respect, but through his association with Verrick he realizes that the society and even the lottery itself are corrupt. In a crucial moment, after the elderly, benevolent Leon Cartwright has acquired the position of Quizmaster through illegal manipulation of the lottery, Benteley asks Cartwright, “What are you supposed to do in a society that’s corrupt? Are you supposed to obey corrupt laws? Is it a crime to break a law that’s a rotten law, or an oath that’s rotten?” (§14.147). Here, the central issue of the novel is spoken by the protagonist to the current Quizmaster, an elderly, trustworthy visionary, the prototype of both the Afirican-American presidential candidate, Jim Briskin, in <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> and Sebastian Hermes, the Flask of Hermes Vitarium owner of <emphasis>Counter-Clock World.</emphasis> Earlier, debating whether individuals should be loyal to people, institutions, or abstractions, Benteley decides that “a person should be loyal to an ideal” (§8.81). This is the position he attempts to maintain throughout the novel and especially when he breaks his oath to Verrick in order to defend a more honorable man, Cartwright. However, Benteley’s ultimately honorable personal choice and the expressed values of the narrative are undermined by Dick’s conclusion. Benteley has learned that the artificial assassin, Keith Pellig, ruled by the mind of the ambition driven Herb Moore, is not driven by a random twitching but by a “need,” a “submarginal syndrome of hate and desire and terrible fear” (§12.132). However, Moore/Pellig’s “twitching” is not in its order rational either. Here is the novel’s point: It is ordered drive and ambition that is irrational and that, ironically, is why the solar lottery doesn’t work. Both Verrick and Cartwright break corrupt laws and violate unjust oaths while seeking power. The difference is that one does it for personal gain and the other, presumably, for the general good. Cartwright has now stacked the deck, gained complete control of the lottery, which now “doesn’t operate randomly at all.” Instead, it guarantees Benteley as the perpetual Quizmaster, who becomes both “protector and serf at the same time” and who has “nobody to answer to but [his] own-conscience” (§17.178−179). So, Dick replaces a totalitarian ruler with a benevolent dictator, a Quizmaster who can be trusted to act according to “conscience.” And this seems to denote a form of progress, for Benteley has shown himself sensitive to the plight of the unks, concerned about the deaths of the slaves who die producing Callistan beetle-juice for the elite, and moral enough to break his fealty oath to Verrick and support Cartwright.</p>
   <p>However, the novel’s final comments, spoken by the ghostly voice of the prophet John Preston, who is worshipped by Cartwright, overrule our faith in a Quizmaster governed by conscience as they locate the conclusion firmly within 1950s notions of progress, themselves implicitly governed by manifest destiny. Preston’s disembodied voice, a record left behind by a dead man, speaks to the African-American Captain Groves and his Prestonite passengers seeking the wisdom of the prophet on the legendary tenth planet called the Flame Disc: “It isn’t senseless drive. . . . It isn’t a brute instinct that keeps us restless and dissatisfied. I’II tell you what it is: it’s the highest goal of man—the need to grow and advance . . . to find new things . . . to expand” (§17.188).</p>
   <p>While Dick’s African-American spaceship captain is present for Preston’s moving speech, and while the author shows sympathy for the disenfranchised “unks” throughout the novel, <emphasis>Solar Lottery</emphasis> never quite achieves the level of social critique that appears in <emphasis>Eye in the Sky,</emphasis> and its expansionist call for fulfillment through manifest destiny ties Benteley’s case of conscience to precisely the faith in colonial expansion that Dick attempts to critique in <emphasis>The Crack in Space.</emphasis> Clearly, as Dick himself points out in the Rickman interviews <emphasis>(IHOW</emphasis> 122−123), this is an immature science fiction. Its saving graces might be its implicit critique of conspicuous consumption and its presentation of an African-American spaceship captain, two gestures that Dick considered ahead of their time. However, its real point of interest for this analysis is its failure to resolve the loyalty dilemma posed by the novel’s principal conflict, a dilemma he would return to in <emphasis>Eye in the Sky,</emphasis> a much more highly regarded novel, but one equally flawed in its moral vision.</p>
   <p>This vision in <emphasis>Eye in the Sky</emphasis> is focused principally through Jack Hamilton’s moral dilemma when his employers confront him with his wife Marsha’s potential communism and, ultimately, when he discovers his friend McFeyffe’s actual communism, which he cannot prove. However, this dilemma also refocuses Dick’s views of a moral obligation to resist any authority that equates dissent with treason through Hamilton’s relationship with Bill Laws, the African-American graduate student in physics and tour guide at California Maintenance Labs’ Bevatron. Once more, Dick confronts issues of loyalty and race, expanding his address to each in an apparent attempt to symbolically resolve perceived social contradictions by enacting them in narrative form. Ultimately, however, Dick’s treatment of these issues in <emphasis>Eye in the Sky</emphasis> ends in the same kinds of necessary compromises that close <emphasis>Solar Lottery,</emphasis> compromises that deny forceful moral opposition to corrupt authority.</p>
   <p>Compromise, in fact, seems at the heart of Dick’s early novel writing experience and of his cases of personal, social, and political conscience. I have already shown how Messner Publications’ Fadiman urged Dick to eliminate the interracial happy ending of <emphasis>Mary and the Giant</emphasis> and then failed to publish the work anyway. In the symbolic realm, moral and ethical integrity also seem compromised by necessity when Ted Benteley assumes power through loopholes engineered in the twitching of the bottle and implicitly accepts a policy of manifest destiny at the end of <emphasis>Solar Lottery.</emphasis> Finally, editorial criticism compromised the early manuscript of <emphasis>Eye in the Sky,</emphasis> requiring changes in Dick’s satire of religious authority. Before discussing these specific changes, however, I must establish the narrative context and suggest why issues of loyalty and race in Dick’s third science fiction novel<a l:href="#n_175" type="note">[175]</a> are so infrequently discussed, for this understanding will assist my later argument regarding <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> and <emphasis>Counter-Clock World.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Eye in the Sky’</emphasis>s situation-eight characters whose consciousnesses are fused by a proton beam accident and who fall prey to the private vision of whichever injured character is closest to recovering consciousness at any given moment-clearly parallels the polyencephalic fusion of the space travelers in <emphasis>A Maze of Death</emphasis> (1970), just as the weakening and dissipation of a private reality in <emphasis>Eye in the Sky</emphasis> when a character is “killed” or rendered unconscious parallels the dissipation of the space travelers’ fantasy worlds in the 1970 novel as each one of them “dies.” Similar parallels can be drawn between the semiconscious characters and semirealities of <emphasis>Eye in the Sky</emphasis> and the half-lifers of <emphasis>Ubik</emphasis> (1969), some of whom extend their own existence by consuming the mental energies of other half-lifers, just as Arthur Silvester, Mrs. Pritchet, Joan Reiss, and Charley McFeyffe in <emphasis>Eye in the Sky</emphasis> sustain their private realities in part by feeding on the paranoia and energies of other injured characters; or between the multiple-space-inclusion, drug-induced realities of <emphasis>Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said</emphasis> (1974); or between the parallel universes of <emphasis>The Man in the High Castle</emphasis> (1962); or between the simulated realities of <emphasis>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</emphasis> (1968) and <emphasis>Eye in the Sky’</emphasis>s address to fraudulent universes. These kinds of parallels in form and general content often serve to justify discussion of these and other Dick novels as significant moments in a progressively developing body of work.</p>
   <p>Dick himself retrospectively views his work this way in a number of <emphasis>Exegesis</emphasis> entries. He includes <emphasis>Eye in the</emphasis> SAy-along with the other novels named earlier and a long list of his other relevant works—in a list of the “progressive parts of one unfolding true narrative,” indicates the presence of a “mysterious salvific entity which often takes trash forms” as important to the unfolding narrative, and even suggests the “right order” in which to read the crucial novels (Sutin, <emphasis>In Pursuit of VALIS</emphasis> 165−203). <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> and <emphasis>Counter-Clock World</emphasis> are conspicuously absent from Dick’s discussion despite their formal and content similarity to a number of the works on his list. The operative question is why these two novels are omitted from Dick’s list and virtually ignored by critics when they, too, treat alternate realities and mysterious salvific entities. Perhaps a brief look at the effects of viewing <emphasis>Eye in the Sky</emphasis> as an early entry in Dick’s series of fraudulent universe novels, at the novel’s compromised publishing history, and at Dick’s treatment of Bill Laws will help to explain the critical dismissal of the two late 1960s novels.</p>
   <p>The line of inquiry suggesting that Dick’s later, more “important” novels are merely refinements of his early emphasis on paranoia and irreality, or of his developing technique, denies the self-consciously enacted political bases of his work by deflecting attention from the social and political contexts informing the novels. Dick as artist becomes the object of all inquiry and his private psychology becomes the focus of critical attention. These analyses lead to what Robert Philmus has criticized, in “The Two Faces of Philip K. Dick,”<a l:href="#n_176" type="note">[176]</a> as the “privatizing of Dick’s works,” justifying “psychoanalyses of the strictly etiological type” that explain those works as the by-products of some “childhood trauma” or private neuroses (251). While psychoanalytic commentaries on Dick’s novels are certainly reasonable, and while much strong work has been done in this area, it seems equally reasonable to investigate them as symptoms not merely of personal, but also of political anxieties, particularly when they depict crises of moral obligation and racial strife parallel to those commented on in Dick’s interviews and private writings. As I have argued earlier, attention to Dick’s political anxieties and his own comments on the novel expose <emphasis>Eye in the Sky</emphasis> as an attack on totalitarianism, cold war McCarthyism, and the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) as “paradigms of evil” (<emphasis>IHOW</emphasis> 128−131) and as the author’s attempt to symbolically resolve social contradictions and enact his own moral obligation to oppose any authority that equates dissent with treason. What I have yet to explain is that (as in <emphasis>Mary and the Giant</emphasis>) Dick’s political and social critique in <emphasis>Eye in the Sky,</emphasis> especially as it linked rigid religious doctrine to his paradigm of evil, was also compromised by editorially required revisions.</p>
   <p>Our principal concern here is the fraudulent reality emanating from the private vision of Arthur Silvester, the “white-haired war veteran” who accompanies Jack Hamilton, Marsha Hamilton (suspected communist), Joan Reiss (a paranoid and “severe young businesswoman”), Mrs. Pritchet (a “plump middle-aged mother”) and her young son David, and Charley McFeyffe (chief of security at California Maintenance Labs and secretly a communist infiltrator) to an ill-fated demonstration of a new “Proton Beam Deflector” led by tour guide Bill Laws. Just as Marsha comes to realize that Jack actually does suspect her, the beam “gets away” and sends the eight principals and their observation platform crashing to the floor. In the brief time it takes a medical team to rescue them, they experience four subjective realties, beginning with Silvester’s pseudo−Islamic vision of a “Ptolemaic universe” (§7.92) ruled by “(Tetragrammaton)” or “YHWH,” a deity with an “insatiable” appetite for praise (§7.105).</p>
   <p>Bill Laws and Jack Hamilton, the physicist and the engineer, quickly discover that this world “makes sense” (§3.39), that it has its own laws and rules: Blasphemy and hateful comments bring bee stings and showers of locusts; relics have healing power and prayer brings coins from heaven. At Electronics Development Agency, where he must apply for a job because his dismissal from California Maintenance Labs as a security risk holds even in this universe, Jack learns that the true function of engineers is now to build and maintain open lines of communication with (Tetragrammaton). This engineering feat succeeds in “piping grace for every Babite community the world over” (§4.53).</p>
   <p>While Dick avoids direct comment on the relation of Silvester’s “screwball cult” (§8.114) and his defense of “his country” and “the white race” (§8.119) to totalitarian repression, prayer and worship do become loyalty oaths in the extreme, complete with guarantees of success and comfort. Minor transgressions receive minor punishments-like the bee stings-while unbelievers become misshapen, boil-covered creatures until they learn to sing (Tetragrammaton’s) praises. African-Americans begin compulsively to “shuffle” and speak in dialect, a behavior Bill Laws self-consciously adopts as a mode of survival. The novel’s implicit linking of compulsive worship to totalitarian repression becomes most clear when (Tetragrammaton’s) Wyoming “mosque” is compared to “a government building in the Soviet Union” (§7.100). The cult of the Second Bab is described as “Islamic”(§5.65) and “non-Western” (§5.73), furthering its association with an outside threat. The repressive qualities of religion, then, seem to serve, like the dually inflected McFeyffe who is both chief of security and a communist infiltrator, to focus Dick’s anxieties over both McCarthyist loyalty oaths and exterior totalitarian threats.</p>
   <p>However, McFeyffe, as a megalomaniacal American security officer turned totalitarian/communist, actually represents an internal threat evocative of Dick’s sense of moral outrage and obligation whenever dissent-here represented through Marsha Hamilton’s association with the League of Women Voters and the Save the Rosenbergs Appeal, her support of Charlie Chaplin, and her contributions to the Society for the Advancement of Colored People—is equated with treason. In fact, Joan Reiss’s “severe” vision, apparently generated in part by her business mentality and Mrs. Pritchct’s prudish, sanitized irreality directed in part toward ensuring the power and success of her son, at least on her own terms, also expose threats internal to 1950s American culture. Why, then, did Dick so emphatically dissociate Silvester’s fanatical spiritual vision from American Christianity, associating it instead with Islamic and Soviet threats? The answer lies in editorial imperatives.</p>
   <p>The original manuscript represented Silvester’s deity as a vengeful Old Testament patriarch. It was Donald Wollheim of Ace Books who, fearing that “religious people” and groups like “the American Legion” might object, convinced Dick to transform his Judeo-Christian God into the god of a “minor, imaginary cult” <emphasis>(IHOW</emphasis> 296−97). Wollheim used the carrot of promising to publish <emphasis>Eye in the Sky</emphasis> as a single volume when most Ace science fiction novels were being printed as Ace Doubles to assist Dick in his editing decision. So Dick’s first “single”—ostensibly a critique of loyalty oaths and repression—is ironically bom partially through compromise, through an act of censorship, but a pragmatic act. And this compromise directs our attention away from the original critique of patterns of oppression internal to the United States, away from a critique of monotheistic and patriarchal theology as complementary to McCarthyist witch hunts and racial oppression. Some of the original critique remains in (Tetragrammaton) and his “peripatetic messengers, presenting the True Faith through various mass media. Television, movies, books, recorded testimonials” (§7.104), but even this satire is directed toward an external threat through its representation as religious “Jihad” (§7.103).</p>
   <p>This compromise not only tames Dick’s critique of an implicitly totalitarian Old Testament deity whose characteristics suggest complicity with the values sustaining McCarthy and HUAC, it removes reactionary American religious doctrine from Dick’s attempts to critique institutional racism. Earlier in this chapter I suggested that this critique is central to <emphasis>Eye in the Sky</emphasis> but ignored by most critics, and in my preceding comments I have hinted at racism’s direct connection to Dick’s “paradigm of evil.” The FBI dossier on Marsha Hamilton, compiled in the “real” world before the Bevatron accident, calls “questionable” her affiliation with the Society for the Advancement of Colored People and remarks that she often “turns up when some Commie group organizes to protest a lynching in the South” (§1.13). To McFeyffe and Colonel T. E. Edwards, the director of California Maintenance Labs, Marsha’s contacts equal overwhelming “guilt by association” (§1.12), and Jack is advised to convince Marsha to lose her “Red” connections or to lose Marsha if he hopes to retain his job. So, in the novel’s opening, Race, or any connection to racial justice, is Red.</p>
   <p>This institutional and formal perception of race as a threat also governs Silvester’s cult, for, as I indicated earlier, the Second Bab requires loyalty not only to country, but to “the white race” (§8.119). This loyalty requirement applies to each of the fraudulent realities and has rather serious consequences for Bill Laws, who becomes a caricature of an African-American in Silvester’s and Pritchet’s realities, and then finally becomes Dick’s spokesperson for racial justice. In Silvester’s world, Laws begins to “shuffle” in and out of reality, while literally shuffling as he walks: “The Negro’s face twitched in a spasm of acute, helpless misery. ‘In this world—’ Sorrow blurred his eyes. In this damned place, I’ve started to shuffle’” (§6.82). On one occasion, after Laws shuffles out of existence, Hamilton asks McFeyffe why Laws “shuffles . . . . He never shuffled before.” McFeyffe replies, “They’re that way” (§6.84), assimilating and condoning Silvester’s view of Laws and African-Americans. “That way” extends to stereotypical speech patterns in both Silvester’s and Pritchet’s realities when Laws gives in to the pressure to survive and conforms to the dominant personalities’ expectations. Speaking to Jack and Marsha, Laws reveals his strategy:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>“You-all looka yhar,” he told Hamilton. “Look, man, how Ah bin done in. This yhar goddam wuhl’ done kick <emphasis>me</emphasis> square in de ass.”</p>
    <p>“Are you doing this on purpose?” Hamilton demanded . . . .</p>
    <p>“Puhpus?” The Negro gazed vacantly at him. “What you-all mean, Massah Hamilton?”</p>
    <text-author>(§8.112)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>When Hamilton asks if the dialect is an “act,” Laws replies that he is “beating it,” that he can feel “the pull” of Silvester’s vision but that he is “going it one better” (§8.112). In Pritchet’s world, Laws continues his strategic burlesque: “Ah jes’ strings along wit’ what Ah finds. Iffen Ah do, Ah lives longah” (§9.155). Frustrated by the act, Hamilton criticizes Laws and a debate central to the novel’s address to racial struggle ensues. Laws’s speech is worth quoting at length, for it focuses the issues central to Dick’s treatment of race here and elsewhere:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>“I tell you what . . . . You try being colored awhile. You try bowing and saying, ‘Yes sir,” to any piece of white trash that happens to come along, some Georgia cracker so ignorant he blows his nose on the floor . . . . Try that awhile. Try putting yourself through six years of college washing white men’s dishes in a two bit hash house. I’ve heard about you; your Dad was a big shot physicist. You had plenty of money; you weren’t working in any hash house. Try getting a degree the way I did. Try carrying that degree around in your pocket a few months, looking for a job. Wind up guiding people around with an arm band on your sleeve.”</p>
    <text-author>(§11.158)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>This speech not only characterizes Dick’s critique of white privilege and an institutionalized racial politic that disenfranchises even resourceful, educated African-Americans, it refocuses Laws and Hamilton’s relationship, preparing the way for the novel’s resolution. Defending his policy of exteriorizing others’ visions of him as a means of survival, Laws accuses Hamilton of complicity with policies of racial injustice. This complicity extends beyond Hamilton’s privileged background to his blindness to the nature of the “real” world they’ve left behind. Hamilton has been attempting to convince Laws to drop the act and participate in efforts to get back to their reality. Laws argues that he is better off where he is: “Want to know why I’m better off here? Because of you, Hamilton. It’s your fault, not mine . . . . If you had made some attempt back there . . . but you didn’t” (§11.158). Hamilton responds by accusing Laws of having become conditioned to complicity with the system himself and argues that Laws has given up the struggle out of fear of failure. Then he defends Laws against McFeyffe’s racial slur (“It’s a waste of time—he’s nothing but a coon” §11.159) and urges Laws to reconsider his position.</p>
   <p>This debate, left unresolved at this moment, links with Laws and Hamilton’s earlier engineering feat to prepare us for their final relationship and for the novel’s resolution. At issue here is the insidious nature of private visions, both within these fraudulent realities and in the “real” world that they have left behind. Both characters are beginning to realize that the longer they reside in a particular reality, the more completely assimilated they become. However, these two are generally able to systematically work to make sense of fraudulent realities and to engineer escapes, thereby revealing their entrepreneurial characteristics. In Silvester’s universe, for example, instead of using their engineering skills to pipe grace throughout the world, they discover that a vending machine at “Safe Harbor,” a bar figuring prominently in each section of the novel, operates on the principle of divine replication, never needing replenishment. The two engineer a means of replacing a candy bar with a small quantity of brandy, thereby producing an endless supply of the expensive liquor, and then lose their enthusiasm when they realize that their discovery will do them no good, will reap no profit when they return to the “real” world because the principle will no longer apply. After escaping this world by rendering Silvester unconscious, Pritchet and Reiss’s realities by “killing” them, and McFeyffe’s communist reality when he is accidentally rendered unconscious by his own henchmen, Laws and Hamilton recover their entrepreneurial enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Marsha Hamilton, Joan Reiss, Mrs. Pritchet, Bill Laws, and Jack Hamilton are all once more in each others’ good graces, while Charley McFeyffe has been exposed to all of them as a hard-line communist. But what kind of grace has Philip K. Dick engineered here? Jack Hamilton appears before his previous employer, Colonel Edwards, McFeyffe, and the California Maintenance Labs board of directors to accuse McFeyffe of his communist affiliations and to clear Marsha’s name, but he is unsuccessful on both counts. More important, appropriately “moral” in his response to the situation, he agrees that his evidence against McFeyffe is grounded in private knowledge and that the security chief should be considered “innocent until proven guilty.” Dick’s critique of the developing totalitarian state reduces to “no real Communist is going to expose himself’ (§16.247). Colonel Edwards and the board of directors hear a lecture on their inability to ferret out the true commies, the true subversive threats, but their basic principles are not condemned, at least not directly, and Hamilton leaves the company to start his own business manufacturing high-fidelity equipment in partnership with Bill Laws—a business financed by Mrs. Pritchet, who has been convinced that their project is to bring culture to the masses.</p>
   <p>So the extent of Hamilton’s moral opposition to authority is compromise: a failed attempt to prosecute McFeyffe for his communist affiliation, a refusal to continue designing bombs and missiles for the firm that has already fired him, and a new private sector partnership with Bill Laws in an engineering firm designed to make them both rich while risking only the cultural elitist Mrs. Pritchet’s money. While Dick’s claim that his depiction of an interracial business partnership in a 1956 science fiction novel is ahead of its time has some validity, while Bill Laws does extend Dick’s concern with race initiated through his depiction of the African-American Captain Groves, and while Dick’s critique of institutionalized racism certainly moves beyond the validation of manifest destiny informing <emphasis>Solar Lottery’s</emphasis> conclusion, <emphasis>Eye in the Sky’</emphasis>s resolution resolves little more than Hamilton’s middle-class guilt and replaces the expansionist destiny of the culture in space with a privatized entrepreneurial vision validated by interracial cooperation for personal gain through the exploitation of white cultural elitism.</p>
   <p>Apparently satisfied with his depictions of Hamilton and Laws, Dick would not emphasize racial issues again until around 1963, when he submitted the first half of <emphasis>The Crack in Space,</emphasis> originally published separately as <emphasis>Cantata 140.</emphasis><a l:href="#n_177" type="note">[177]</a> Here, issues of race and colonial imperialism dominate the text, relegating Dick’s typical concern with nested realities and private visions to secondary roles. If we conceive of Dick’s writing as to some extent an intervention in the Real to symbolically resolve social and political contradictions through narrative, then the reasons for the dominance of racial and imperialist issues in both <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> and <emphasis>Counter-Clock World</emphasis><a l:href="#n_178" type="note">[178]</a> are reasonably transparent. Protests against the American presence in Vietnam, the Black Studies Movement, developing national awareness of Elijah Muhammad’s Islam and of Black Nationalism-these and many other issues foregrounded by the growing counterculture in the early 1960s once more connect Dick’s emphases to his sense of moral obligation in relation to social and political contradictions and to his revived connection to racial justice previously focused through childhood reminiscence and his experience with the African-American chauffeur. A discussion of these two novels’ critiques of manifest destiny justifying colonial expansion and of their presentation of more fully developed African-American characters as extensions of Dick’s earlier attempts to resolve his own ambiguous feelings about race and social justice potentially establishes <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> and <emphasis>Counter-Clock World</emphasis> as important events within the context of Dick’s larger body of work. This discussion might also serve to uncover how the Real intervenes in our encounters with these two novels—and in Dick’s very conception of them—to contribute to their lack of critical success, even among otherwise wholly supportive readers of Philip K. Dick.<a l:href="#n_179" type="note">[179]</a></p>
   <p>Set in 2080 A.D., an election year, <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> depicts the election campaign of Jim Briskin, an African-American ex-TV newsclown and Liberal Republican candidate for president. As a “Col” candidate in a United States currently run by the white majority, Briskin must forge an alliance between the Cols, only 60% of whom generally vote, and the white working-class majority. “William Schwarz, the incumbent President and States Rights Conservative Democrat (SRCD), is faced with the same problem. The crucial issue confronting both candidates is disposal of the tens of millions of “bibs,” mostly poor, uneducated Cols who have been “bottled in bond,” that is, placed is deep sleep storage by the office of Special Public Welfare (SPW). Schwarz’s principal support comes from the wealthy and from working-class whites who fear losing their jobs to Cols. The interests of working-class whites are represented by Verne Engels, who leads CLEAN, a racist hate organization secretly financed by the SRDC, presumably in order to prevent Briskin’s election by exacerbating racial fears.</p>
   <p>The official current solution to the problem of overpopulation by the uneducated, other than deep sleep storage, is free consultation at open abortion clinics. One of these clinics is run by a prominent counselor named Myra Sands, who is married to an even more prominent organ transplant surgeon, Dr. Lurton Sands. Dr. Sands has been secretly raiding bib warehouses to steal organs from the sleeping Cols in order to sustain his practice and maintain his reputation. At the novel’s opening, Myra Sands has hired a private investigator, Tito Cravelli, to locate Cally Vale, Dr. Sands’s mistress in hiding. Doctor Sands’s attempts to conceal his mistress in an alternate universe, an “alter-Earth” that he discovers through a defect in his jiffi-scuttler, and Myra Sands’s desire to expose the affair and bring Vale to trial so that she can profit from the divorce settlement precipitate the disruption of the balance of power that has kept Schwarz in the Presidency. Previously, Schwarz had investigated terraforming and migration as solutions to both the bib and the overpopulation problems. However, the proposals of Bruno Mini, the scientist promoting a “planet wetting” scheme, had proved unsound.</p>
   <p>In the opening moments of <emphasis>The Crack in Space,</emphasis> then, Dick establishes the foundation for a critique of institutionally sustained racism in the welfare state, politics, and medicine. Schwarz retains political power partially through the intentional exacerbation of working-class fears of job loss to Col workers; Myra Sands justifies counseling young Cols to accept what amounts to genocidal abortion and to become bibs by conceiving of her advice as in the best interests of both society and the Cols; Lurton Sands considers his murdering of almost 400 bibs as a moral, even a heroic act because he only kills “potentially” while saving someone “right now, someone conscious and alive in the present, someone dependent on [his] skill” (§6.61). In each case, the character perpetuates exploitation of the Cols as necessary to sustain the status quo, an action that coincidentally also sustains each character’s power or prestige. Whatever the flaws of Dick’s novel, its foundation in an attempt to critique the contradictions inherent in a social and political order sustained by exploitation of feared minorities establishes it as a complexification of his address to race in <emphasis>Eye in the Sky.</emphasis> How successful he is at enacting this critique becomes a function of his depiction of Jim Briskin and his resolution of the contradictions posed by the opening conflicts.</p>
   <p>Dick himself considered <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> “a terrible novel,” one “that didn’t work out.” He supports this judgment principally by associating it with his last days with Anne Dick and by his implicit agreement with Rickman’s assertion that it is “a carry-over” from Dick’s Second Period, before he narrowed his focus to two to four central characters (<emphasis>IHOW</emphasis> 171). The latter criticism is appropriate, as Bruce Gillespie points out in “Contradictions,” his 1969 review of three Dick novels: “A seemingly endless cascade of kinky and/or representational characters hurtle before our eyes, with about one character disappearing from, or coming into sight every ten pages” (25). Indeed, Dick represents the action from the viewpoints of no fewer than eight characters in <emphasis>The Crack in Space,</emphasis> shifting focus so frequently that a coherent center cannot be located-unless it is Jim Briskin, the most frequently represented viewpoint and clearly meant to be the most sympathetic character. This alone marks a shift in Dick’s emphasis, for he never represented the thoughts of Bill Laws in <emphasis>Eye in the Sky.</emphasis> It is a dangerous move, one far more likely to expose Dick’s own anxieties about racial conflict than his wholly exterior depiction of Bill Laws.</p>
   <p>Briskin is initially presented as an absolutely ethical, moral, and perfectly honest presidential candidate who “was not authentically a leader of the Col people” and who “represented Whites and Cols alike” (§3.24). His political naivete, perhaps indicative of Dick’s own, extends to his eagerness to shut down the Golden Door Moments of Bliss Satellite—an orbiting house of prostitution—despite the political power wielded by its influential, two-bodied owner, George Walt, simply because he believes it immoral. Against the advice of Sal Heim, his campaign manager, Briskin also promises to revive Bruno Mini’s terraforming project, hoping that the impractical will magically provide a solution to the bibs’ plight. Dick also presents a seemingly sexless Briskin; he is unmarried and has no love interest in the novel. Briskin is ultimately depicted as a safe, nonthreatening minority male. In fact, despite Dick’s recurring referencing of Briskin’s status as a Col, he is an exceedingly “white” candidate who never associates with another Col, unless one counts the private investigator, Tito Cravelli, who seems to associate himself with working class Cols. Unlike Bill Laws, who accuses Jack Hamilton of complicity in institutionalized racism because of Hamilton’s failure to act and who selfconsciously shuffles and speaks in stereotypical black dialect to ensure his survival, Briskin suppresses his Col identity to gain power. His apparent honesty and moral stance, however, are not enough to eliminate the increasing welfare debt compiled by maintenance of the bibs or to solve the problems of the unemployed.</p>
   <p>Dick negotiates a resolution to Briskin’s dilemma and earns him the Presidency of the United States, but only through a series of compromises that undermine his moral and ethical credibility. Investigating the disappearance of Cally Vale for Myra Sands, Tito Cravelli discovers that she is hidden in the alter-Earth accessible only through Lurton Sands’s defective jiffi-scuttler, which Sands has returned to Pethel Jiffi-scuttler Sales &amp; Service. Cravelli attempts to bribe Briskin with the information, offering to reveal a solution to the bibs’ problem, but only if Briskin first promises him the cabinet post of Attorney General. Briskin replies, “tell me what your information is. I can’t make that promise until I hear it.” Cravelli resists momentarily, then says, “Once I tell you—but you’re honest, Briskin. Everyone knows that” (§5.49). While Briskin’s integrity remains intact-he doesn’t really accept the initial bribe-after hearing the information, he does agree to make Cravelli, hardly a qualified candidate, his Attorney General if he should win the election.</p>
   <p>Later, when an expedition to the alter-Earth is formed, Briskin once more compromises his principles. The expedition includes Leon Turpin, the owner of Terran Development, the firm that invented jiffi-scuttlers; Frank Woodbine, an internationally famous space explorer hired by Turpin to lead him through the porthole; Darius Pethel, owner of Pethel Jiffi-scuttler Sales &amp; Service; Sal Heim and Briskin, among a few others. The expedition is clearly a business venture, led by an explorer/conqueror, and its principal interest is creating opportunities for exploitation and colonial expansion, as is indicated by Turpin’s view of the possibilities and by the laser pistols carried by the participants. Realizing that he controls the only porthole to the alter-Earth, Turpin thinks, “Earth belongs to me. This particular Earth, anyhow,” and then exclaims, “Look at that forest down below; look at all that timber!” (§8.89). He then considers the possibilities for mining ore and drilling for oil. When Briskin agrees to participate in the expedition, ostensibly to scout alter-Earth for colonization by bibs but also for political gain, his behavior parallels Turpin’s. When he first refuses to carry a laser pistol but later accepts one “with massive reluctance,” while arguing that they shouldn’t “be going to meet them [the inhabitants of alter-Earth] armed like this” (§10.109), he doubly compromises himself. Unlike Laws and Hamilton of <emphasis>Eye in the Sky,</emphasis> he fails to realize that the longer he resides in a particular reality—in this case that of political necessity—the more assimilated to that reality’s values he becomes.</p>
   <p>When the explorers finally meet alter-Earth’s inhabitants and discover them to be “pre-humans” related to “Sinanthropus” or “Peking Man,” the racial issues in the book, momentarily concealed by Briskin’s neutral honesty, resurface and link to the notions of colonial imperialism sustained by manifest destiny already implicit in Turpin’s agenda. At this point, Sal Heim re-emerges as the principal critical voice as he begins to question the impact of an extended encounter with a new, “inferior” race. Despite his reservations regarding exploitation and conquest, and despite Heim’s urging Briskin to cancel the emigration to alter-Earth and appeal to Tuipin to close the porthole, Briskin continues to promote colonization of alter-Earth. Through Heim, Dick voices all of the clichéd fears regarding encounters with racial others. After first seeing a “Peke,” Heim asks Briskin, “So who wants to talk to that semi-ape?” He later asks Briskin, “how’re we going to deny them the vote?” and continues, “He’s going to be voting. . . . I can see it coming, and then you know what? Mixed marriages” (§10.116, 118). At this point, Briskin’s naive desire for a colonization of alter-Earth by bibs and the unemployed, whom he expects to live in harmony with the Pekes, conflicts with Heim’s fears of true racial difference, or at least of <emphasis>Homo sapiens’</emphasis> response to that difference.</p>
   <p>Later, when Briskin once more refuses to deny a platform of emigration and colonization, Dick directly speaks his critique of colonial expansion through Heim: “This planet . . . will still be able to absorb seventy million bibs . . . . But there’s going to be friction . . . . It’s going to be roughly a re-enactment of the situation when the first white colonists landed in the New World . . . . The Pekes in North America will be driven back, step by step, until the continent is cleared of them” (§11.124). He continues to explain that after North America, Europe and Asia will follow. Heim’s conflicting responses to the issues-his evocation of stereotypical racial fears and his condemnation of colonial imperialism sanctioned by a belief in progress through the conquest of inferiors as our destiny-can, I suppose, be reconciled. Assuming that Dick is completely in control of his characters, one could argue that Heim has used the stereotypical racial fears to motivate Briskin to reject a program of expansion. However, it seems more likely that Gillespie and other critics are right, that Dick simply lost control of a hastily written novel, one that was half written a few years earlier and then expanded. Even so, the peculiar set of relations between Heim’s double discourse on racial others and colonial expansion and Briskin’s seemingly honest optimism serves to lay bare the ambiguity at the center of Dick’s long term encounter with these issues.</p>
   <p>In its resolution, <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> certainly does not condone progress as a function of manifest destiny as <emphasis>Solar Lottery</emphasis> did, nor does it finish by depicting an easy partnership between its African-American and white protagonists. It ends instead with yet another compromise by Briskin and a moral spoken by Heim. The emigration proceeds under the direction of Schwarz, who sends marines to protect the colonists. The Pekes, however, despite their technological inferiority, turn out to possess superior psionic powers and, ultimately, destroy the colonies and invade our earth with the help of George Walt, who fled through the porthole after a conflict with Cravelli and has duped the Pekes into believing that he is the “wind god” referred to in their scripture. Able to “warp time and also space to suit their needs,” to “walk through wood,” and even to “annihilate time” (§13.159−160), an ancient Sinanthropus philosopher broadcasts his demands to Earth from George Walt’s satellite and requires <emphasis>Homo sapiens</emphasis> to sue for peace.</p>
   <p>While the Schwarz administration crumbles, having counted on successful emigration to win re-election and unable to stop the Pekes, Briskin flies to the Golden Door Moments of Bliss satellite, ostensibly to bargain with the Sinanthropus, but in reality to expose George Walt. Having learned from Cravelli’s earlier encounter with George Walt that one of his bodies is artificial, Briskin rips off his artificial arm during a handshake, exposing the satellite’s proprietor as a fraud. Declaring that “it’s impossible to do business with you Homo sapiens; you’re adept, polished liars” and that it is “unnatural to seek to participate in an exclusively destructive relationship,” the ancient Sinanthropus simply “vanishes” (§13.172). Briskin, having duped George Walt through the seemingly honest offer of a handshake, declares that “honesty generally wins out.” George Walt replies, “Like everybody else, I more or less trusted you, Briskin. It never occurred to me you’d trade on such techniques to win an issue. Your integrity’s just a myth!” (§13.173). So Briskin’s final compromise has been to use his reputation for honesty to promote a literal lie to expose a substantial truth. George Walt was in fact naturally a two-bodied being with a single head; he simply replaced one body with an artificial substitute after that body’s death. Therefore, he did literally fulfill the role depicted in the Pekes’ myth. Briskin knew this but used the information to expose an unsuspecting George Walt for what Briskin conceived to be the greater good, which just happened to include his winning the Presidency. But what exactly does Briskin win?</p>
   <p>All of the Pekes except Bill Smith, the first Peke encountered on the expedition, have withdrawn and sealed the porthole to their world, so alter-Earth is no longer a solution or a threat. Tens of millions of bibs remain in deep sleep, millions of Cols remain unemployed, and Briskin has returned to his original terraforming policy. Sal Heim, disenfranchised because he earlier quit the campaign when Briskin insisted on closing the Golden Door Moments of Bliss satellite and promoting terraforming, speaks Dick’s final message to his wife, Pat. Like Pat, Sal Heim is unable to shake the feeling that some Pekes remain, always lurking just out of sight. He concludes that “it’s just our consciences bothering us” (§14.178). Later, he summarizes the lesson of the encounter with Sinanthropus: “the difference between say myself and the average Negro is so damn slight, by every truly meaningful criterion, that for all intents and purposes it doesn’t exist. When something like that, a contact with a race that’s not Homo sapiens occurs, at last we can finally see this” (§14.178). Heim’s denial of significant racial difference, spoken it seems as the message of Dick’s novel, is clearly undermined, not only by the ambiguous role played by Heim in the novel, but by <emphasis>The Crack in Space’</emphasis>s final moments.</p>
   <p>Bill Smith appears at Briskin’s office, surprising the president and his staff as they prepare to leave for Pat and Sal Heim’s victory party. Twice, the Peke attempts to speak to Briskin on behalf of his people, as the “sole surviving member of his race” on this earth (§14.185). Each time he is cut off. Finally, Briskin explains, “You’re welcome to come along, but don’t make any speeches. . . . We’ve got other things on our minds, now” (§14.185). So the legacy of the sole remaining racial other is condescension and, according to Briskin, “the memory of contact with [the Sinanthropus] is beginning to fade” (§14.185). While Gillespie argues that <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> “stays flippantly happy to the end” (24), an argument that can be sustained by the comic presence of an absurdly dressed Bruno Mini in the novel’s final few paragraphs, Dick’s return to the opening status quo and Briskin’s undermining of Heim’s message as he prepares to serve two terms as President hardly establish a happy ending.</p>
   <p>Again, the confusion that ends this novel, even as it serves to justify many of the critical judgments inflicted on it, also serves to expose Dick’s inability to symbolically resolve his concerns. While he to some extent complexifies his address to both race and manifest destiny here, he is actually less successful in addressing these issues than he was in <emphasis>Eye in the Sky.</emphasis> The closeting of the effects of colonial expansion through Briskin’s fading memory and the failure of Briskin’s and Heim’s political relationship, more pessimistic than the final moments of <emphasis>Eye in the Sky,</emphasis> nonetheless suit a novel governed principally by liberal guilt. While Lawrence Sutin’s rating of the novel as a 2 on a scale of 10 might be a bit harsh, his encapsulation of <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> as “a well-intentioned liberal tale” is quite justified (303), for Dick’s sometimes preachy address to colonization and race, unlike <emphasis>Eye in the Sky,</emphasis> never allows us to distinguish the Cols from the whites, and by displacing racial difference onto the Sinanthropus, he unwittingly justifies the arguments of Verne Engel’s CLEAN. It seems that through a standard SF technique-displacement to effect social criticism through figurative distance and exaggeration-Dick has at best exposed his own liberal guilt over racial injustice and at worst has perhaps allowed the intervention of his own real fears regarding racial strife to bias his depiction of Jim Briskin.</p>
   <p>In <emphasis>Counter-Clock World,</emphasis> Dick avoids some of the difficulties inherent in his interior attempt to represent an African-American perspective through Jim Briskin by returning to white protagonists. Racial conflict and social criticism remain central to the novel, however, as Dick depicts a black nationalist organization loosely based on Elijah Muhammad’s Nation of Islam and incorporates direct references to Malcolm X and to the Watts riots of 1965. As in <emphasis>The Crack in Space,</emphasis> cases of conscience and rationalization through self-lies sustain an appearance of moral and ethical judgment until circumstances compel the principal characters to confront the truth of their experience.</p>
   <p>The setting is Los Angeles of 1998, twelve years after initiation of the Hobart Phase, when time started moving backward. The United States has been divided into three pieces, and Alaska and Hawaii have declared their independence. The division occurred sometime in the late 1960s and was partially the result of the sermons and writings of the Anarch Thomas Peak, a Rhodes Scholar, jazz musician, ex-Episcopal priest, and the founder of Uditi, an African-American religious cult that practices spiritual “unification” through shared hallucinogenic drug use. Before he died in 1971, Peak and his followers formed an independent state, the Free Negro Municipality (FNM), in the Midwest. The current leader of the Uditi, the Reverend Raymond Roberts, has just arrived in Los Angeles of the Western United States, ostensibly to preside over a public unification service, but in reality because he has learned that the Anarch Peak is about to become undead. These circumstances bring Dick’s protagonists-Sebastian Hermes, owner of the Flask of Hermes Vitarium, and Joseph Tinbane, a Los Angeles policeman-together.</p>
   <p>Because of the Hobart Phase, a universal time reversal that recurs every few billion years, all natural functions have been reversed. The dead are renewed (become “old-born”) and proceed to reverse their prior existence, complete with disgorging food to fill plates and cups, until they ultimately regress into their mother’s wombs, while their mothers continue to regress until all of human and geological history recapitulates itself in reverse. Presumably, the universe then returns to forward time motion and the cycle repeats itself. The situation necessitates treatment for the old-born as they return to life, for they could suffocate in their coffins and require immediate medical attention to ease them back into life.</p>
   <p>Because Tinbane’s beat takes him by remote cemetaries, he has befriended Hermes, whose small vitarium struggles to survive in competition with more powerful corporate interests. As an old-born who retains vague memories of his encounter with God in the afterlife, Hermes tries to operate an ethical business and to maintain a sense of moral vision. While the Flask of Hermes Vitarium’s stated policy is to place “deaders” with their surviving relatives, it survives on occasion by selling disinterred clients to the highest bidders. When Hermes stumbles upon Peak’s grave, he is confronted by a moral dilemma, a case of conscience. The Reverend Roberts, most believe, would pay a huge sum to silence the Anarch so that he could retain his power in the Uditi Church and the FNM; The Library, whose function it is to eradicate all records when their time is up, also fears the Anarch because of his potential to produce new doctrine and complicate the retrograde motion of time; The Church of Rome, because of the probability that Peak would retain memories of his afterlife experience, is also a potential bidder. While the power struggle over the Anarch Peak poses a significant problem for Hermes, one that pits moral judgment against personal gain, especially since laws prevent vitarium owners from selling the old-born to anyone who might cause them harm, his crisis of conscience really begins before the Anarch awakes.</p>
   <p>Realizing that he cannot take the chance that others will not find the Anarch’s grave before he actually begins to wake, Hermes decides to break the law by disinterring Peak prematurely. Confronted with the legal risks by his engineer, Bob Lindy, the medical risks by his resident physician, Dr. Sign, and the spiritual risks by his resident priest, Father Faine, Hermes rationalizes the premature unburial. This decision, which folklore says will release “the forces of death” to “come to rest on one person” (§6.45), determines Hermes’ actions for the rest of the novel, just as Briskin’s agreement with Cravelli in violation of his principles precipitates a series of further compromises in <emphasis>The Crack in Space.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Joseph Tinbane confronts a similar moral dilemma that is further complicated by his fascination with Lotta Hermes, Sebastian’s wife. Knowing that Hermes has found the Anarch’s grave, Tinbane should report its location to his superiors, but he also knows that the rights to the Anarch could ensure the success of Hermes’ business. Furthermore, as a policeman, he is obliged to consider the Anarch’s need for protection that Hermes is unlikely to be able to provide. Because of his attraction to Lotta, Tinbane’s case of conscience, like that of Sebastian Hermes, presents personal needs and loyalties in conflict with professional and moral obligations. Like Ted Benteley of <emphasis>Solar Lottery</emphasis> and Jack Hamilton of <emphasis>Eye in the Sky,</emphasis> both men struggle over their loyalties to self, other people, institutions, or ideals. Like Briskin, however, Hermes and Tinbane constitute their moral and ethical dilemmas through self-lies.</p>
   <p>This issue is established early in the novel, just after the Flask of Hermes team has unearthed Peak and brought him to the Vitarium. As Hermes tries to explain his vague memories of his “life” as a corpse, memories constituted mostly through dreams, he explains that he recalls a sense of feeling larger than he actually was and of a “presence, beating like a huge heart,” an angry presence that forces him to remember his true size. R. C. Buckley, the Vitarium’s salesman, explains that “that’s what happens on the Day of Judgment. That’s the day you have to face all of the reality you’ve been avoiding. . . . we all lie to ourselves; we tell ourselves more lies than we ever do other people” (§8.54). Tinbane, whose “every act done while wearing his uniform was official, not to mention impersonal” (§1.11), is progressively stripped of his professional demeanor through his lust for Lotta Hermes, until he finally uses his knowledge of an innocent mistake to try blackmailing her into sex. After learning the location of Peak’s grave when Lotta blurts it out in conversation, Tinbane realizes that he can use the information to manipulate her and then is “horrified” at his own thoughts (§5.35). When he confesses his thoughts to Father Faine, without revealing the identity of his lust object, Faine confronts Tinbane with an undiscovered truth: “You’re not afraid of doing wrong; you’re afraid of doing wrong and failing, and having everyone know” (§5.39). After confessing his love to Lotta and being rebuffed, Tinbane abandons her to the library, where she will likely be interrogated for the location of Peak’s grave, and then immediately regrets his decision. “It’s my moral burden, whatever happens to her; it’s on my conscience, until birth” (§9.63). This realization precipitates an argument with his wife, Bethel, who throws him out of their apartment without his uniform. Stripped of his impersonal symbol of stability, Tinbane chooses the personal over the professional, storms the Library, and rescues Lotta. While the act assuages his conscience and temporarily earns him her love, it also leads to his death at the hands of Library agents, children who laser him in the motel room where he and Lotta are hiding. Tinbane’s case of conscience, resolved without any apparent connection to the racial issues in the novel, nevertheless prepares us to understand Hermes’ later choices and their relationship to conscience, loyalty, and the racial conflicts in <emphasis>Counter-Clock World.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Like Tinbane, Sebastian Hermes must see through the lies that he has told himself if he is to ease his conscience, not only over his treating the Anarch Peak as a commodity, but over his exploitation of Lotta. As an old-born, Hermes vaguely recalls that moment of truth in death when ignorance was stripped away and he realized his true, rather small size. “It was necessary for me to be confronted, finally, with the truth,” he says after Buckley’s comment on seeing through the lies we tell ourselves (§8.55). However, Hermes often sees through his own deception only when it’s too late. For example, he insists that Lotta go to the Library for information on Reverend Roberts, claiming that he was too busy, but he ultimately realizes that he had actually “yielded to his own fears; he spared himself and let her suffer” (§5.41). His rationalization regarding Lotta, like that allowing him to unearth the Anarch Peak, precipitates a series of events entirely beyond his control and links his personal to his more broadly cultural case of conscience.</p>
   <p>Hermes’ direct encounter with the reality that he has been avoiding and the lies he has been telling himself occurs after he has lost both Lotta and the Anarch Peak to the Library. The Library’s agents kidnap Lotta after murdering Tinbane; they negotiate Peak’s kidnapping partially by distracting Hermes with their agent, Ann McGuire, yet another of Dick’s dark-haired girls. Hermes sleeps with her, presumably to receive the seed of the child McGuire has assisted in becoming unborn by taking it into her womb. In reality, Hermes is both punishing Lotta for her affair with Tinbane and responding to McGuire’s appeal to his vanity, while McGuire is distracting Hermes to assist the Library in its kidnapping of Peak. These events facilitate Hermes’ case of conscience, for he becomes trapped between the Church of Rome and the Free Negro Municipality, both of whom present compelling but contradictory arguments for their right to Peak. Relieved of the responsibility for making a moral judgment by the Anarch’s kidnapping, he nevertheless becomes the agent of their joint plan to infiltrate the Library and rescue Peak. Reverend Roberts and Tony Giacommetti of the Church of Rome supply Hermes with an assault survival kit consisting of spray LSD, an antidote for the LSD, and an injection to temporarily free himself of the Hobart Phase so that hours of his subjective time will equal only a few minutes of common time. The plan invokes the crucial case of conscience confronting Hermes, for he must choose between personal loyalty to and love for Lotta and his obligation to culture, history, and perhaps even to God.</p>
   <p>Roberts directly defines the conflict of moral vision facing Hermes when, just before Hermes leaves for the Library, he speaks his final instructions: “You love your wife and she is precious to you . . . but in terms of history, she does not count—as does the Anarch. Try to recognize the distinction, the finiteness of your personal needs, the almost infinite value of Anarch Peak” (§15.119). Hermes, like Tinbane, has no difficulty resolving the conflict in his moment of crisis: “Once he entered the Library all talk about the ‘transcendental value to history’ had evaporated, gone up in the smoke of the LSD grenade” (§18.132), which caused everyone to devolve “into a personal realm” (§16.125). Hermes leaves Peak, rescues Lotta, and fails to change history. Later, he decides that he has made his personal life more important-at the expense of every other living human being, and especially the Uditi. “[He has] destroyed the whole newly forming basis for world theology” (§18.135). This revelation, instigated principally by Roberts’s outrage and the accompanying death sentence to be enacted by the Uditi leaders Offspring of Might, is overruled by Hermes’ ensuing visionary encounters with the Anarch Peak himself.</p>
   <p>The Anarch Peak’s appearances to Sebastian Hermes—in a dream, on the rooftop outside Ann McGuire’s apartment, and in his own apartment—collectively validate Hermes’ choices, thereby assisting him in resolving his loyalties, and ultimately speak the message of <emphasis>Counter-Clock World.</emphasis> First, in Hermes’ dream, he tells Hermes that he is “the savior of mankind,” who will redeem it simply by dying again (§19.137). Then, on the rooftop, Peak tells Hermes that he is a vision, a hallucination who can “spiritually” leave the Library, where he remains captive and near death. His purposes are to absolve Hermes of guilt by explaining that Hermes could not have saved him because his chair was rigged with a splinter bomb, and to ask Hermes to save Ann McGuire by warning her about an impending Offspring of Might attack (§20.143−145). When Hermes complies, at his request, Ann McGuire summarizes the Anarch’s spiritual philosophy, which he has recited in fragments since he became old-born. The citations from Augustine and Aquinas, Boethius and Erigena that begin each chapter of the novel constitute part of the philosophy that McGuire summarizes through references to Plato’s “absolute reality” and to the eternal conflict between form as “Eidos” and “anti-eidos” as “the form-destroying factor.” The problems of spiritual truth and seeing through the lies, of uncovering the reality that we persistently avoid, then, becomes a matter of “perception.” What we experience as evil is “the decay of form,” which is itself a “delusion.” In reality, even when it “looks like the man is gone . . . the universal, the category, the form-it’s still there” (§20.146). Not only does this penultimate textual moment expose Sebastian Hermes’ namesake as Hermes Trismegistus, it also establishes <emphasis>Counter-Clock Worlds</emphasis> philosophical relation to Dick’s exegesis, to novels ranging from the early <emphasis>Cosmic Puppets</emphasis> to the final Valis trilogy. Peak’s final appearance solidifies this novel’s already implicit connection to <emphasis>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,</emphasis> for until Peak’s appearance in his apartment to warn him of an impending Offspring of Might assassination attempt, Hermes has questioned the “reality” of his visions. Now secure in his belief in Peak’s appearances and philosophy, Hermes is also secure in the validity of his choices, his election of the personal over the institutional and over transcendent history. Unable to save Lotta from the Uditi assassins’ bomb, Hermes aimlessly wanders back to the cemetery where he found Peak’s grave. There, despondent, he rediscovers his calling through the cries of “deaders” seeking help. So Hermes reclaims his purchase on moral vision through the counsel of an African−American salvific entity, through commitment to people, not to religious, social, or political institutions or to abstractions.</p>
   <p>In those moments just before Lotta Hermes’ and the Anarch Peak’s deaths, the others-Mavis and Ann McGuire, Ray Roberts, Tony Giacommetti, even Chief Harrington of the Los Angeles Police Department-all maintain their allegiance to organizations and their ideas, their justifying abstractions. The dominant impression revealed through television coverage of the Free Negro Municipality inspired assault on the People’s Topical Library, however, is created by media interviews with Mavis McGuire, the Head Librarian, and her daughter, Ann, who proclaim the Library’s innocence and blame Uditi-inspired “religious bigotry” dating back to Malcolm X and the Watts riots of the 1960s as the perpetual causes of violence. The sentiment is repeated for emphasis by the television announcers, furthering Dick’s critique of institutionalized racism.</p>
   <p>While <emphasis>Counter-Clock World</emphasis> takes refuge in the personal, a move parallel to those that end the other three novels discussed here, while it suffers from an implausible and difficult-to-sustain governing idea in the Hobart Phase, and while it ultimately poses no better solution to racial strife than <emphasis>Solar Lottery, Eye in the Sky,</emphasis> or <emphasis>The Crack in Space,</emphasis> it remains an important Philip K. Dick novel, especially because of its early presentation of motifs and ideas that inform many of Dick’s subsequent novels, including <emphasis>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</emphasis> (which is in many respects a rewrite of <emphasis>Counter-Clock World), The Divine Invasion, VALIS,</emphasis> and <emphasis>The Transmigration of Timothy Archer.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Each of the aforementioned novels seeks a strategy of containment, a symbolic resolution to social conflict and class-based racial fears enacted through narrative. Earlier commentary in this chapter exposed Dick’s sense of a deep, personal connection to African-Americans and a desire to express his moral outrage at racial injustice. Each of these four narratives, however, reveals the inadequacy of Dick’s imaginary interventions to excise an irrefutable Real that denies resolution of those social contradictions. Dick’s attempts to resolve his own ambiguous, personal relation to African-Americans succeed mainly in elevating to a painful level of consciousness his own racial fears, his own sense of liberal guilt. Ultimately, his attempts at symbolic resolution are superseded, in <emphasis>Counter-Clock World,</emphasis> by the anagogic, evidenced principally through the Anarch Peak as a salvific entity and through the equating of Sebastian Hermes’ destiny with that of humankind. The sense of racial justice that remains unavailable to Dick on moral or symbolic terms in his earlier novels is recontained by the priority of the spiritual in <emphasis>Counter-Clock World.</emphasis> This gesture alone, as the final strategy of containment in his overt treatment of racial justice, connects these four novels to the body of Dick’s work.</p>
   <subtitle>NOTES</subtitle>
   <p>1. Jameson’s discussion appears in Chapter 9, “Nostalgia for the Present,” of <emphasis>Postmodernism.</emphasis> The chapter originally appeared as an article in <emphasis>SAQ</emphasis> 38:2 (Spring 1989): 517−37.</p>
   <p>2. Fitting’s “Reality as Ideological Construct: A Reading of Five Novels by Philip K. Dick” was first published in <emphasis>Science-Fiction Studies</emphasis> 30 and is reprinted in Mullen, <emphasis>On Philip K. Dick</emphasis> 92−110. Throughout my analysis, citations of Fitting’s essay refer to this reprint.</p>
   <p>3. I am indebted to Fredric Jameson’s “On Interpretation,” the introduction to his <emphasis>The Political Unconscious,</emphasis> for this notion of narratives as socially symbolic acts through which contradictions-insurmountable on their own personal, social, and broad cultural terms—are resolved in formal and aesthetic realms. In particular, see pp. 74−102, Part HI of that essay.</p>
   <p>4. All citations of Rickman’s biography refer to <emphasis>To the High Castle: Philip K. Dick, A Life: 1928−1962.</emphasis> Throughout this biography, Rickman reveals contradictions and distortions in Dick’s accounts of his experience by cross-referencing Dick’s own multiple comments on particular events with those provided by others. My interest, however, is not in uncovering the truth of Dick’s personal life, but in accounting for his expressed feelings about issues relevant to this analysis, and for a personal and perhaps even cultural “structure of feeling” (to appropriate and place my own inflection on a phrase of Raymond Williams’s in <emphasis>The Long Revolution</emphasis> [48−71]) that might have governed the production of the texts in question.</p>
   <p>5. I stress the distinction between memory and actual experience principally because of contradictions pointed out by Rickman in his biography. For example, Dick stated that he spent two years at Countryside School, while Rickman uncovered records showing only a six-month stay. Rickman learned from Tessa, not from Phil Dick, that Countryside was a school for kids with behavioral problems. In fact, Rickman announces that most of the first five chapters of his biography will be taken up addressing events that are “open to interpretation” either because of competing evidence or because the only evidence is what Dick told Rickman or others (5−6).</p>
   <p>6. Rickman’s series of interviews with Philip K. Dick occurred between April 1981 and February 1982. Here, I draw on the interview account of Dick’s relationship with the unnamed African-American who taught him to drive, rather than the version presented and discussed in <emphasis>To the High Castle</emphasis> (238−239), because Rickman’s interview triggered an account of this experience in a context more meaningful to the present analysis. All citations from the interviews refer to <emphasis>In His Own Words.</emphasis></p>
   <p>7. The following events are also described in <emphasis>To the High Castle</emphasis> with Kleo Dick’s commentary added (238−239). Kleo, of course, is Kleo Apostolides, whom Dick married in 1950 and divorced in 1958, shortly after meeting Anne Rubenstein, whom he married in 1959.</p>
   <p>8. For Disch’s comments on Dick as a Marxist, see the “Introduction” to the Gregg Press hardcover edition of <emphasis>Solar Lottery.</emphasis> The essay, revised and expanded, appears as “Toward the Transcendent: An Introduction to <emphasis>Solar Lottery</emphasis> and Other Works,” in Martin Harry Greenberg and Joseph D. Olander, Eds., <emphasis>Philip K. Dick</emphasis> 13−25. The problem of Dick’s Marxism is complicated not only by his apparent failure to understand the definitions of the term in use by Disch and others like Jameson and Fitting and by his conflation of Marxism and Communism in the Rickman interview, but by Dick’s private assertion in the <emphasis>Exegesis:</emphasis> “Glanced over SOLAR LOTTERY &amp; Tom Disch’s intro; he’s right. I was/am the sole Marxist S-F writer. I may not have been/am CP [Communist Party], but the basic Marxist sociological view of capitalism—negative—is there” (Lawrence Sutin, Ed., <emphasis>In Pursuit of VALIS</emphasis> 175). These comments, written three years before the Rickman interview, demonstrate Dick’s inconsistent views of Marxism and Communism, of the definitions applied to the terms, and of his views regarding his own work.</p>
   <p>9. While <emphasis>Eye in the Sky</emphasis> was published as Dick’s fourth novel in 1957, records at Scott Meredith Literary Agency (SMLA) show that the manuscript was submitted on February 15, 1955, indicating that it is the third in order of composition after <emphasis>Solar Lottery</emphasis> (received in March, 1954) and <emphasis>The World Jones Made</emphasis> (received December, 1954). <emphasis>The Man Who Japed,</emphasis> published in 1956, was submitted in October, 1955, and <emphasis>The Cosmic Puppets,</emphasis> an expansion of the short story “A Glass of Darkness” (first published in 1953) was submitted in May, 1957. See Appendix B of Rickman’s <emphasis>To the High Castle.</emphasis> Most important here, of course, is that these dates establish <emphasis>Eye in the Sky’s</emphasis> composition as contemporaneous with Dick’s writing of <emphasis>Mary and the Giant,</emphasis> which was also first submitted to SMLA in early 1955.</p>
   <p>10. I cite the reprint of this essay in <emphasis>On Philip K. Dick.</emphasis> Philmus’s essay originally appeared in <emphasis>Science-Fiction Studies</emphasis> 53 (March 1991): 91−104. The discussion cited here appears on page 97 of <emphasis>Science-Fiction Studies.</emphasis></p>
   <p>11. While <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> is correctly viewed as an expansion of the much shorter <emphasis>Cantata 140,</emphasis> published as a novella in the July 1964 <emphasis>Fantasy and Science Fiction,</emphasis> it has even earlier roots in the short story “Prominent Author,” first published in May 1954 in <emphasis>If.</emphasis> In that story, Henry Ellis, a New York businessman working for Terr an Development, discovers a dimensional rift in the jiffi-scuttler that he is testing for the company. The device is essentially a transportation tunnel that allow Ellis to commute over 160 miles to New York in only five steps. Ultimately, he discovers that the rift looks into an earlier time in earth’s history and that the tiny beings whom he communicates with through the hazy thin spot in the jiffi-scuttler’s wall are actually ancient Hebrews living in an accelerated time relative to his own. Ellis adopts the role of the Old Testament God and writes the Bible, which he gifts to his own past. The story is briefly summarized in <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> as an “incredible legend” repeated by ‘scuttler repairmen (§2.18−19). Throughout my analysis, I cite the 1977 Metheun paperback edition.</p>
   <p>12. While neither Paul Williams nor Gregg Rickman has been able to document precisely the dates of <emphasis>Counter-Clock Worlds</emphasis> completion or receipt by the Scott Meredith Agency, Williams estimates that Dick completed the novel in “late 1965” (<emphasis>Only Apparently Real</emphasis> 182). In the following discussion, all citations refer to the Berkley edition of May 1974.</p>
   <p>13. The lack of critical address to these novels, of course, is due in part to a lack of reprints, for neither <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> nor <emphasis>Counter-Clock World</emphasis> has been reprinted in nearly two decades in the United States. Even now, when some of Dick’s lesser novels such as <emphasis>Solar Lottery</emphasis> and <emphasis>The World Jones Made</emphasis> are available in recent editions, <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> and <emphasis>Counter-Clock World</emphasis> remain out of print in this country. So, early negative critical judgment has resulted in little or no commentary on the novels despite their somewhat significant positions in both Dick’s personal and professional development. <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> is the last novel he wrote while living with Anne Dick and was completed just before their separation, while <emphasis>Counter-Clock World,</emphasis> according to Dick, is the first novel written during his romance with Nancy Hackett just after his move back to Berkeley. The latter novel, then, is the first in which Dick moves, according to Rickman, “from the multi-character plots of the 60s to the Third Period plots centering around two to four people” <emphasis>(IHOW 170).</emphasis> Regardless of their quality, then, these two novels should be of interest to scholars investigating Dick’s work. Because critical rejection has resulted in their general lack of availability, I will present somewhat detailed plot summaries while discussing them, both to assist readers in following the argument and to generate greater interest in them and their issues.</p>

    <p>Chinese Finger-traps or “A Perturbation in the Reality Field”:</p>
    <p>Paradox as Conversion in Philip K. Dick’s Fiction</p>
    <p>by Michael Feehan</p>
   </title>
   <cite>
    <p>The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function (69).</p>
    <text-author>—F. Scott Fitzgerald, “The Crack-Up”</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>Chinese finger-traps appear at various moments in Philip K. Dick’s novel <emphasis>VALIS</emphasis> as an emblem of the kind of double-twisting, self-contradictory experience(s) which Joseph Heller calls “Catch-22.” Sometimes, Dick is referring to the relations among characters in a story, sometimes to the relations between the writer and his writing, sometimes to the relations between the writer and his reader, sometimes to the beliefs about reality that the reader will bring to the act of reading. At times, all these various levels seem to be swirling simultaneously.</p>
   <p>For instance, the narrator of <emphasis>VALIS,</emphasis> speaking of himself, Horselover Fat, in the third person, for “objectivity,” tells us,</p>
   <cite>
    <p>In essence, Fat monitored his own mind and found it defective. He then, by the use of that mind, monitored outer reality, that which is called the macrocosm. He found it defective as well . . . . Fat, using a defective instrument, swept out a defective subject, and from this sweep got back the report that everything was wrong. And in addition, there was no way out. The interlocking between the defective instrument and the defective subject produced another perfect Chinese finger-trap.</p>
    <text-author>(§3.40)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>The character, Horselover Fat, becomes trapped in a puzzle from which there is no escape; that puzzle is redoubled because the trapped character is identical to the persona who tells us about the trap; then that redoubled trap is redoubled by the fact that the narrator is the defective Fat; and finally, the reader is trapped in wondering about the author’s beliefs about the imaginative relations between authors and their personae. As the work progresses, the finger-trap gets more complicated as we learn that the narrator is really Philip Dick, who is also Horselover Fat, who does not exist.</p>
   <p>I shall argue that these self-reflexive twists, versions of which appear throughout Dick’s fiction, became the central obsession of his last fiction, the group of novels which I will call, following Kim Stanley Robinson, the Valis trilogy: <emphasis>VALIS</emphasis> (1981), <emphasis>The Divine Invasion</emphasis> (1981), and <emphasis>The Transmigration of Timothy Archer</emphasis> (1982). The methodology for this argument will be based on Kenneth Burke’s “Dramatism,” a program of analysis which allows an explicit description of the relations among the various kinds of finger-traps with which Dick confronts his readers. Burke has built a theory of language in which paradox plays the foundational role, a systematic approach to the idea Fitzgerald suggests in the opening epigram. It is crucial at the outset to understand the difference between the Burke, Fitzgerald, and Dick attitude and the seemingly similar attitude of the dialectic.</p>
   <p>Both the dialectician and the connoisseur of finger-traps begin with the idea of paradox. The difference resides in the goals of the thinker A dialectician seeks resolutions; a gamester seeks to keep the game going. Plato gives us a Socrates who systematically questions the verbal formulations of some philosopher in search of that one formulation which most nearly approximates the Ideal Truth. Hegel looks at various moments in history to see how each contributes to the process of transcendence, which progressively drives the world toward the Absolute. For both these forms of dialectic, the goal is to find the endpoint of argumentation, that proposition which is conclusive, which eliminates the paradox. In the case of Chinese finger-traps, the dialectician will be happy to discover that the paradox is resolved by withdrawing from the game. Thenceforth, the dialectician will not only not stick his fingers in the trap but will take it as a necessary mission to prevent others from making that childish mistake.</p>
   <p>The connoisseur of finger-traps will also discover that victory comes only in retreat, but will thenceforth take occasional opportunities to become trapped again for the sheer pleasure of the redoubled paradox. And the connoisseur will invite others to become trapped, letting some in on the joke, leaving others to their own devices. The “correct” answer will be both known and acknowledged, but the hegemony of “correctness” will be denied and the denial itself will be flaunted by the connoisseur to himself.</p>
   <p>For Dick, the source of infinite paradox resides in the idea of twins, in literal and metaphorical doublings. He told Gregg Rickman, “So in any real in-depth biography of me or any real in-depth study of me as a person, this is really the origin-if there can said to be a tragic theme running through my life its [sic] the death of my twin sister and the re-enactment of this again and again” <emphasis>(The Last Testament</emphasis> 93). Dick did not know his twin sister; she died when he was so young that no real memories remained. But he needed her, so he invented her, a full and wholly fictional life for a twin who “might have been.” This need for the twin and the quest to find that hidden Other “originates” the tragedy of the man. Grief is transformed into desire. Jane, Philip K. Dick’s twin sister, became an obsession—to know her, to see her living, to understand what part she played in him. Dick felt himself to be protean, fluid, Continuously changing, split down the middle. Twinning resides at the origin of Dick’s burdens, and as a result the twistings and turnings of doubling cannot be fictioned away. The paradox of the One which is Many cannot be effaced, because that paradox creates the possibility of all the fictions. (Of course, in SF the defining twin is time: We shift our favorite dreams of today into some tomorrow, thus converting our present sense of loss and nostalgia into quests for improvements in a possible, if unlikely, future.)</p>
   <p>Twins characteristically set themselves apart from others by their doubleness. In his biography of Philip K. Dick, <emphasis>Divine Invasions,</emphasis> Lawrence Sutin writes,</p>
   <cite>
    <p>The obsession, found in twins, with dualities—as complementary and conflicting at once—has been termed <emphasis>twinning</emphasis> by Dr. George Engel (“The drive is always to be two, yet unique from all others”). This “twinning” motif found expression in a number of Phil’s stories and novels, notably <emphasis>Dr. Bloodmoney</emphasis> (1965), <emphasis>Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said</emphasis> (1974). <emphasis>A Scanner Darkly</emphasis> (1977), <emphasis>VALIS</emphasis> (1981), and <emphasis>The Divine Invasion</emphasis> (1981). (17−18)</p>
   </cite>
   <p>Yet twins do not merge into one another, however much they may feel themselves as doubles. Each retains individual identity. The paradox of seeing myself in my Other cannot be eliminated and continually produces nuances as we grow and change. This process of twinning parallels Kenneth Burke’s idea of identification: “A is not identical with his colleague, B. But insofar as their interests are joined, A is identified with B. Or he may <emphasis>identify himself</emphasis> with B even when their interests are not joined, if he assumes that they are, or is persuaded to believe so” <emphasis>(Rhetoric of Motives</emphasis> 20). Dick continually reenacts the death of his twin sister, all such reenactments occurring in and through Dick’s own imagination. The twins always remain distinct-Philip lives, Jane dies-yet both survival and death recur only within Philip Dick. Both of the twins are created within Dick, each reenactment takes a new, unexpected form, yet Philip Dick never merges into Jane Dick or vice versa. The paradoxes never reach conclusion. The work of the fiction is to take readers into various ramifications of twinning, to persuade us into paradoxes of identification.</p>
   <p>Burke argues for a deep-seated process of conversion, a becoming one which never eliminates the two. “Here are ambiguities of substance. In being identified with B, A is ‘substantially one’ with a person other than himself. Yet at the same time he remains unique, at once a distinct substance and consubstantial with another” <emphasis>(Rhetoric</emphasis> 21). Individual identity coexists with shared identity. Dick shares himself with his sister without losing track of his own substance. The potential ramifications of such intersectings are infinite:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>Any pair of characters may create the conditions of consubstantiality at any time, for any reason, under any circumstances. Every such drawing together can be infinitely redoubled simply by stepping back from the immediate event to a consideration of the context within which that situation occurs and thence to the context of that context and so on-movements between microcosms and macrocosms, in endless variety. Burke’s key term for this process is <emphasis>Circumference,</emphasis> a term whose purpose is to keep us aware that (1) any time we describe an event, we have already set out parameters, limits, within which a specific set of persons, places, times, tools, ideas and rituals will be operating; (2) once we set out a situation, we can base an interpretation on any of its aspects by simply choosing one element as dominant or representative; and (3) language allows us, at any moment, to widen or narrow our focus, with concomitant changes in both the contents of a situation and the range of possible interpretations. For written documents, we may look at the internal structure of the words and sentences, at the internal structure of the discourse, at the relations between writer and discourse, at the place of the discourse in the writer’s life or in “the life of the times.” Every change of Circumference presents us with a new set of questions and a new hierarchy among the participants</p>
    <text-author>(<emphasis>Grammar of Motives</emphasis> 77−85).</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>Dick’s obsession with his twin ensures that such questions perform key roles in all his works, but they become central to the final Valis trilogy. In February and March of 1974, Philip K. Dick entered into a long series of visions which he believed to be direct revelations from God. An immediate and continuing writerly outcome of these visions is the <emphasis>Exegesis</emphasis>, “a largely handwritten journal, some eight thousand pages long, devoted to the solution of 2−3−74” (Sutin 209). Dick also continued writing fictions, full of doubles, until he began <emphasis>VALIS,</emphasis> in which passages from the <emphasis>Exegesis</emphasis> appear as speculations by the main character Horselover Fat, who is also the narrator, Phil Dick. Kenneth Burke’s concept of Circumference can help us sort through the various forms of twinning which emerge here and extend, in a variety of guises, throughout the trilogy.</p>
   <p>One particular moment, one we looked at earlier in defining the idea of finger-traps, can serve as a “representative anecdote” <emphasis>(Grammar</emphasis> 59), a focal moment in which many of Dick’s intersecting Circumferences are operating. In the second section of Chapter 3 of <emphasis>VALIS,</emphasis> we are told that Horselover Fat’s madness is exacerbated by the cynicism of a friend named Kevin:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>In my opinion, Kevin’s cynical stance had done more to ratify Fat’s madness than any other single factor-any other, that is, than the original cause, whatever that might have been . . . . Every time Kevin tore down Fat’s system of delusions-mocked them and lampooned them-Fat gained strength.</p>
    <text-author>(§3.36)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>But we had already been told, back in Chapter 1, that the narrator and Horselover Fat are the same person. “I am Horselover Fat, and I am writing this in the third person to gain much needed objectivity” (§1.11). Now, in Chapter 3, this “I” can analyze the third-person Horselover Fat as insane. Then the voice which tells us about that insanity must be itself insane? Would Kevin agree with the narrator’s assessment? Only if Kevin were also insane, because Kevin sees only one person in the story world, Phil Dick, a writer who has dissociated into two personae and sometimes thinks of the mad, nonexistent Horselover Fat as the original persona. Later, during an audience with Sophia, the daughter of Valis, Phil and Fat resolve back into one person, Phil Dick. The wise child sees only Phil, and says so. Then “Horselover Fat was gone forever. As if he had never existed” (§12.190). This “forever” lasts until Phil Dick learns of the death of Sophia, whereupon Fat returns—as though he had never disappeared.</p>
   <p>A second Circumference surrounding the story world is already at issue within the story itself, since Phil Dick is a writer: “I am by profession, a science fiction writer. I deal in fantasies. My life is a fantasy” (§1.12). We are still, here, concerned with the text, not yet with the man Philip K. Dick. The twinning of Phil Dick and Horselover Fat, in itself, directs the reader to ask about the relations between any writer at all and the characters who speak in and for the story. In <emphasis>VALIS</emphasis>, Phil Dick speaks the story to us, Horselover Fat writes a journal which he calls an “exegesis” (§2.22) and which Phil Dick presents to us in boldface at various points throughout the text and as an Appendix to the novel. As readers, we must continuously remind ourselves that Phil Dick, even as he relates the events of the novels, has dissociated into two characters, one of whom is now writing to us, while the other is searching through Micronesia for the next avatar of Valis (§14.227−28). We follow the storyline only insofar as we accept Phil Dick’s narrative as factually accurate. But Phil Dick is mad, a split personality, one half of him apparently rational, the other half delusional—or not. Horselover Fat becomes interesting in his own right only insofar as we reject Phil Dick’s assessment, only insofar as we accept Horselover Fat as a visionary searcher who has reached beyond the veil of the ordinary to see God. Phil Dick tells us that Horselover Fat believes that God is partly irrational, injured through loss and grief. We are given “Entry 32” from the <emphasis>Exegesis:</emphasis> “The changing information which we experience as World is an unfolding narrative. <emphasis>It tells us about the death of a woman (italics mine)”</emphasis> (§3.37). Phil Dick is even editing his twin’s journal. Then, we are told, “If, in reading this, you cannot see that Fat is writing about himself, then you understand nothing” (§3.37). Phil Dick turns directly to us, challenging us to see that Horselover Fat is projecting his own obsession with the death of a particular woman, Gloria Knudson, into a general pattern of the universe. But we also must redouble the “you understand nothing,” since we know that Fat and Phil are the same person. We also know that the Phil Dick who moves through the story is not precisely the same Phil Dick who is now telling us the story, not the surrounding and informing intelligence which is making it possible for the novel to hold together. What does the writer’s persona believe about the events of the story-world?</p>
   <p>Specifically, is the writer presenting Sophia as an actual avatar of God, or is Valis a mad invention of Fat even within the novel?</p>
   <p>That question is posed by Phil Dick immediately following his challenge to the reader in a discussion of Fat’s confrontation with God, “A theopany consists of self-disclosure by the divine. It does not consist of something the percipient does; it consists of something the divine—the God or gods, the high power—does” (§3.37). Fat has received a visitation from Valis, and Phil Dick is inviting us to join him in questioning that visitation: “How are we to distinguish a genuine theophany from a mere hallucination on the part of the percipient?” (§3.37). Fat is mad, but he may also have encountered God. How can Phil Dick tell for himself and how can he tell us what he believes even while he remains twinned? Phil Dick proposes an evaluation measure: “If the voice tells him [Fat] something he does not know <emphasis>and could not know,</emphasis> then perhaps we are dealing with the genuine thing and not the spurious” (§3.37). During his visions, Fat has heard and understood a language which he could not, outside the vision, even identify. He later learned that the language was ancient Greek. The impossible actuality Phil Dick sees as evidence for the truth of Fat’s visions, and he implicitly argues that “we” should also accept Fat’s visions as theophanies. That is, within the scope of the story world, Horselover Fat, who does not exist, really can communicate with God, who really is VALIS and Sophia, etc.</p>
   <p>As Phil Dick continues his discussion of theophanies, he directs the reader’s attention to a next wider Circumference, the world beyond the novel, the world in which the reader is now reading the novel. In arguing for the authenticity in principle of theophanies, Phil Dick refers us to Heraclitus and offers us a long passage of quotation, a passage which we realize half way through has been written by some third party. Following the quotation, Phil Dick gives us the full details: “Thus says Edward Hussey, Lecturer in Ancient Philosophy at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of All Souls College, in his book <emphasis>The Presocratics,</emphasis> published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, New York, 1972, pages 37−38” (§3.39). A sudden mass of specific knowledge about a person who plays no role at all in the novel. The kind of knowledge we receive here, a dust-cover blurb, insists that Edward Hussey and his book exist in the world beyond the novel, that Phil Dick has read this actual, relatively new, highly specialized book. The very next sentence throws us back into the novel’s twinnings. “In all my reading I have-I mean, Horselover Fat has-never found anything more significant as an insight into the nature of reality” (§3.39). Have both Phil and Fat reached the same understanding of Hussey? Does their (mutual or differing) interpretation of Heraclitus come from Hussey or from Heraclitus with Hussey as confirmation? Does Hussey’s book exist in the world beyond the novel; is Phil/Fat’s understanding of Hussey accurate? What is Phil/Fat suggesting we do, read Hussey or Heraclitus? As a kind of answer, Phil Dick follows first with two quotations from Heraclitus and then one from Hussey on Heraclitus. The paragraph ends with a renewed twinning:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>Horselover Fat would like you to consider this above all other things. Because if Heraclitus is correct, there is in fact no reality but that of theophanies; the rest is illusion; in which case Fat alone among us comprehends the truth, and Fat, starting with Gloria’s phonecall, is insane.</p>
    <text-author>(§3.39)</text-author>
   </cite>
   <p>Heraclitus was speaking about the real world, the world in which we are now reading the novel <emphasis>VALIS.</emphasis> In that world, neither Phil Dick nor Horselover Fat exists. Moreover, Horselover Fat does not exist in the story world because he is only a projection of Phil Dick’s. Yet the story only goes on as a story if Horselover Fat sees God. Thus, we, sitting out here safely reading this book, become implicated in Phil Dick’s twinnings.</p>
   <p>At this widest circle of the text itself, we may if we wish step into our own lives to ask how we will place the issues of the text, at any of its levels, into our lives. Or we may ask how the person Philip K. Dick stands in relation to all this. Since the range of reader-response cannot in principle be calculated, I will leave those discussions to the academic debators. In turning to look at the writer, Philip K. Dick, however, we see precisely the same pattern of twinning and intersecting circumferences which are at play within the text of <emphasis>VALIS.</emphasis></p>
   <p>We have already seen that Philip K. Dick claimed that the death of his sister was the life-long obsession in his life and his work. In the Valis trilogy, that obsession becomes the subject matter of his fiction. Philip K. Dick experienced a vision which generated the writing of the <emphasis>Exegesis</emphasis>; Philip K. Dick transformed that experience into fiction; Philip K. Dick sometimes did and sometimes did not keep the two distinct in his own mind. For instance, in one of his interviews with Gregg Rickman, Dick recounted a “terrible dream” involving an injured horse and a grief which extended beyond the dream. Rickman asked, “Is this where the name ‘Horselover Fat’ comes from?” Dick replied, “No, that’s all fiction. I just did that to write <emphasis>VALIS”</emphasis> (27). Rickman, however, remembers that the narrator of <emphasis>VALIS</emphasis> claimed that the name of his alter ego came from translations: “Philip” is Greek for “lover of horses,” “Dick” is German for “fat.” Dick, however, has set that memory out of his mind for the moment because he wants to insist on the deliberately fictional nature of <emphasis>VALIS,</emphasis> his conscious work of setting boundaries between writer and story. Rickman then makes explicit the connection between the translated names in <emphasis>VALIS</emphasis> and the terrible dream: “ ‘Horselover’ could relate to that dream.” And with that Dick remembers, “Yow. That’s the Greek for Phil. I never thought of that. Of course, I haven’t thought of that dream for a long time” (27). Through the whole interview, we hear Dick give a long, full-blown discussion of the dream, deny its relevance to his fiction, then experience a minor revelation in remembering the connection, then jump back to more about the dream and its sources in an even earlier event-when his home was broken into. Event, dream, fiction, memory sometimes intertwined, sometimes separated, as the needs of the moment demand.</p>
   <p>When Rickman asks Dick about the connections between dreams and the writing out of dreams, Dick answers that he does not, while writing out his dreams, recognize any connections between dreams and understanding. “Now I knew none of this when I wrote that. I simply transferred onto the paper what I was dreaming” (<emphasis>Last Testament</emphasis> 129). When he is writing the <emphasis>Exegesis,</emphasis> he says, Tm an amanuensis” (56), that is, a secretary. The visionary writings emerge from some point beyond the writer’s control; the fictions, however, exhibit at least the control of distancing, at least that measure of control involved in the writer’s setting boundaries between memories and imagination. This differentiation of writer’s roles-creator and mediator-recurs throughout Dick’s fictions, becoming central in the Valis trilogy. At issue throughout the three books is a questioning of sources, a questioning which goes on explicitly as conversations among characters and implicitly as various kinds of mediation: Usually some character acts as secretary for the authorial voice of the novel; some character acts as messenger to the characters in the novel-sometimes these roles are assigned to two different characters, sometimes to just one.</p>
   <p>Thus the study of Dick’s writing practice beyond the text brings us back into the text. At a first level, we step from Dick’s biography to look at his final three novels as an interactive process. The argument parallels that of Kim Stanley Robinson’s: “So now we have come full circle; once again, as in the novels of the 1950s, a central subject of the texts is Dick’s ‘generic split.’ But now Dick is in full control of this artistic division” <emphasis>(The Novels of Philip K. Dick</emphasis> 111−12). Not only is Dick in control of his split, he uses that split as the governing framework for the trilogy, developing the second two books out of the issues of the first. “The form of the trilogy is therefore a sort of “V,’ with <emphasis>VALIS</emphasis> at the base, and the other two books at the end of each arm” <emphasis>(Novels</emphasis> 112). Robinson sees, in effect, the second book as emerging from Horselover Fat’s imagination, the third from Phil Dick’s. In Burke’s Circumferential model, <emphasis>VALIS</emphasis> appears as the outer circle which contains with two equal, but not intersecting, inner circles: As Horselover Fat wholly believes in his own visions, the second novel, <emphasis>The Divine Invasion,</emphasis> comes to us from a narrator wholly convinced of the reality of a future in which God is returning in a new and newly problematical Incarnation. As Phil Dick understands but remains skeptical of Fat’s visions, the third novel, <emphasis>The Transmigration of Timothy Archer,</emphasis> comes to us from a narrator who is caught up in paradoxes within the novel, paradoxes within and among the various characters, paradoxes about religion and the nature of reality.</p>
   <p>The narrator of <emphasis>The Divine Invasion</emphasis> is an anonymous omniscient voice, capable of looking even into the mind of God. (An epigram following the title page is ascribed to a “<emphasis>Mysterious voice in the night.”)</emphasis> The narrator of <emphasis>The Transmigration of Timothy Archer</emphasis> is Angel Archer, daughter-in-law of the title character-half believer, half skeptic. (“Angel” is Hebrew for “messenger.”) In <emphasis>The Divine Invasion,</emphasis> the Biblical prophet Elijah acts as messenger, telling mere mortals about the coming of God and reminding the brain-damaged Incarnation of His identity. Emmanuel, the new Incarnation, injured before birth in an auto accident, always knew that he would be born forgetful and so he placed his twin sister in the world. This Zina leads him toward <emphasis>anamnesis,</emphasis> self-memory, though she is not allowed to simply tell God that he is God. At the innermost circle of the novel, inside the mind of God, we encounter the only real act of Creation: Emmanuel remembers Himself and “everything vanished.” People, the world, time itself, all disappear and “he had returned to the void.” The ugliness of the residue allows him to remember the one word, “HAYAH,” the one word of God’s language. “The world returned” (§4.51). God’s Creation wholly makes or wholly eliminates everything; writers only make words. If God actually exists, His acts are always and only efficacious. Now we can return to the story with full knowledge that Emmanuel can save the world any time He wants to. We have no doubts, having ourselves experienced the Absolute.</p>
   <p>The messenger in <emphasis>The Transmigration of Timothy Archer</emphasis> speaks both to us and to the various characters in the novel, arguing with them and with herself about the boundaries between conventional religions and various kinds of cults, arguing about life and death and the lure of life beyond death. “He desired to live. So do I. Presumably, so do you” (§12.194). Angel can look into the story or outward toward us, at her whim. The dominant character makes Angel’s role explicit: Bishop Archer wants Angel to go with him to the Holy Land, as his “secretary” (§13.204). The story line of <emphasis>VALIS</emphasis> becomes formal theological argumentation in <emphasis>Timothy Archer</emphasis> as Bishop Archer, in his writings, sermons, and conversations, draws Angel through complex contradictions of faith (in Greek, <emphasis>pistis,</emphasis> which also means persuasion, the process of conversion <emphasis>[Timothy Archer</emphasis> §3.48]). At the end of this third novel, there may be a new twinning: The dead Timothy Archer may have merged with his own step-son, Bill Lundborg, who tells Angel, “T‘m both. One personality has been formed out of the two. Either name will do. Probably you should call me Bill so that people won’t know’” (§15.232). If true, this twinning is a dialectic, a genuine merger. Problematically, Angel is not sure, so her readers are not sure whether Bill is an emotional cripple, “hebephrenic” (§14.227), or a saint, “bodhisattva” (§14.221). Every character in the book except Angel goes on some kind of quest, seeking God but usually finding only madness or death. Angel reads, Angel interprets, Angel waits. And only after all her loved ones are dead, when the dust has settled, when the sensationalism has faded, when she has returned to her own settled, shop-keeper existence, does Angel begin to write, to lead us into the world Bishop Archer bequeathed her. But Angel does not settle any of these issues for us. She stops her book while our fingers are still caught in her Chinese finger-trap. “Tim would have enjoyed it. Were he alive” (§16.253). Angel will not go on quests, but she keeps getting connected with people who do. Some people will continue to read Dick, and some will leave.</p>
   <p>From here, we may look to the various inner Circumferences of twinning as they flow through the trilogy, or we may look outward to the functions of these three books in the life of Philip K. Dick. Dick said,</p>
   <cite>
    <p>You know what you do? You try to do and you draw off your own background. You do write in your own <emphasis>idiot dialectica</emphasis> and that’s where it ends. And it seems like theology, I mean like divine scripture, to those who happen to agree with you. But the second it’s picked up by a Parsi for example, he doesn’t see anything in it at all. (<emphasis>Last</emphasis> 160)</p>
   </cite>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>We are also open now to returning to Dick’s earlier work to search out the role of The Messenger. How often is The Messenger present? What guise does The Messenger take? Toward what paradoxes of Substance are we directed? For instance, I would propose the <emphasis>I Ching</emphasis> as Messenger for <emphasis>The Man in the High Castle,</emphasis> the operative which connects the two halves of the book; Mercer in <emphasis>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</emphasis> (leaving no traces of his paradoxes in the film conversion, <emphasis>Blade Runner</emphasis> [1982]); and Barney Mayerson in <emphasis>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch.</emphasis> For conversion as opposed to merger, consider the use of the term <emphasis>translation</emphasis> in <emphasis>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch:</emphasis> A chemical splits people in two, one half comatose, the other fully active in an alternative, hallucinatory world. In using the term <emphasis>translation</emphasis> for this chemical process, Dick reminds us without our noticing that all transformations in texts occur as “mere” words.</p>

   <p>1. Whatever his failures as a stylist, and they are several, Dick is arguably among the major writers of the contemporary era. Istvan Csicsery-Ronay, in his Introduction to <emphasis>On Philip K. Dick,</emphasis> goes as far as calling Dick “the single writer most responsible for the acceptance of SF as a dominant genre of literature in the second half of the 20th century” (v), an extraordinary declaration that, in true Dickian fashion, he immediately subjects to comment: “This is a bold claim. I can hardly believe I’m making it. But I simply can’t avoid it.”</p>

   <p>4. By <emphasis>heterology,</emphasis> a term which according to Blanchot derives from Georges Bataille, I mean to identify the specifically poststructural dialectics of ipseity (selfhood) and alterity (otherness); heterology, then, demarcates what in <emphasis>The Visible and the Invisible</emphasis> Merleau-Ponty called “hyper-reflection” or “hyper-dialectics”—“dialectics without synthesis” (50−104). This unresolved but regulated play is crucial to any understanding of Dick’s heterodox thematics.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Heterodox</emphasis> is the antonym for <emphasis>orthodox,</emphasis> which in Greek literally means “straight thinking,” underscoring the fact that Dick’s writing is marked by difference, the loopy lines of heterodoxy; in “Impostor,” difference operates as the ironization or problematization of <emphasis>doxa,</emphasis> the conventional wisdom we inherit from our culture and perpetuate as a kind of naturalized belief. First among these conventions is our notion of the subject, which we typically assume has the clear and distinct, unique and singular status Descartes assigned it. I will return to this notion later.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="n_17">
   <title>
    <p>17</p>
   </title>
   <p>5. In <emphasis>The Collected Stories,</emphasis> this sentence gives “than” rather than “then,” which I read as a simple typographical glitch since earlier editions of the story offer “then.” The typo does, however, provide an inspired intensification of the alienation effect of the story’s final lines. When the text first appeared in 1953, the title’s spelling was “Impostor,“ an acceptable alternate for the more conventional “imposter”; this alternate spelling is consonant with that in the <emphasis>Exegesis.</emphasis> Consequently, I use “impostor” throughout.</p>
   <p>Another revealing typo can be found in another story about reversibility and reinscription, “The Exit Door Leads In” (5:315−31). After spilling coffee on a friend’s suit, a woman tries to clean the stain, and in failing she remarks “It won’t come off”; to which her friend replies: “Symbolism” (326). Yet the text gives “I won’t come off,” neatly marking how the stain of Cartesian subjectivity remains forever with us, forever inscribing an “it” that reflection cannot confirm. I’d like to read these typos as instances of <emphasis>parapraxis</emphasis> (the Freudian mistake or “slip” that reveals a repressed motif). Perhaps Dick would be pleased.</p>

   <p>6. “Paianoia . . . is the fullest extension of the noniterabiltiy of personal experience, and it is aggravated, not diminished, by the specificity and precision of the language games applied and the language they furnish” (93); Sussman is discussing a question within Wittgenstein, but the definition of paranoia applies extremely well to Dick.</p>

   <p>8. In <emphasis>VALIS,</emphasis> Horselover Fat’s alternate personality, who lived circa 45 C.E. during Roman/Hellenistic times, is “Thomas” (109−11, 155). Given Dick’s concern in that novel with the Nag Hammadi Gnostic texts, the conspicuous silence on “The Gospel of Thomas” (the “secret” sayings of Jesus), generally acknowledged to be the most significant of these books, is extremely odd, for this Gnostic gospel underscores the thematic of the double and was available in English in a popular edition as early as 1963 (trans. George Ogg, <emphasis>New Testament Apocrypha,</emphasis> London: Lutterworth). Thomas, tradition has it, was Christ’s brother; in Aramaic, <emphasis>thomas</emphasis> means “twin.”</p>

   <p>13. Naming Merleau-Ponty a poststructuralist will offend some. My reading of the later Merleau-Ponty finds him consonant with the poststructural models of Derrida and Deleuze, but there remain certain scholarly disputes over Merleau-Ponty’s view of how, or if, language mediates “nonreflective perception” (<emphasis>Prose</emphasis> 138). See, for example, his own “Dialogue and the Perception of the Other” in <emphasis>The Prose of the World,</emphasis> or the disputatious commentaries collected in <emphasis>Ontology and Alterity in Merleau-Ponty.</emphasis> Derrida’s reflections on the problematic of otherness appear in <emphasis>Cinders</emphasis> and “<emphasis>Psyché:</emphasis> The Invention of the Other.”</p>

   <p>14. In Lévinas, the two are linked by conceptions of ethical relation; “the . . . word other, in Lévinas, means the transcendence of another person: the infinite relation of one person to another obligates beyond any obligation” (Blanchot 109). See particularly Lévinas’s <emphasis>Otherwise than Being, or Beyond Essence.</emphasis> I wish to thank Michael Beehler for suggesting to me the crucial significance of Lévinas’ thought on this question.</p>

   <p>15. Substitution on the basis of difference is a metaphor; Aristotle’s definition resonates wonderfully with Spence’s dilemma: “Metaphor is the application of an alien name” (295/1456b). Note that Dick’s metonymy is itself structured metaphorically.</p>

   <p>17. To “place under erasure” is not to destroy but to problematize, and it does not result in “the death of the subject,” a phrase that recalls not only Barthes but Nietzsche. Durham addresses “the death of the subject” within <emphasis>The Simulacra</emphasis> (where Dick configures an I-world and a not-I [cf. 224—25]), <emphasis>Now Wait for Last Year, A Scanner Darkly,</emphasis> and <emphasis>VALIS.</emphasis> He argues that, for Dick, late-capitalist culture and hallucinatory drugs (and, we could add, religious mysticism) are isomorphic, since both serve to dissolve the Cartesian subject. Palmer thinks this a “retreat into textuality” (“Postmodernism” 338); but for Dick, even quotidian events are textualized, or intertextual, in the manner of Derrida’s statement that “there is nothing outside the text” (<emphasis>Of Grammatology</emphasis> 158). Problematizing <emphasis>doxa,</emphasis> then, is a confrontation rather than a retreat.</p>

   <p>18. Dick’s understanding of <emphasis>anamnesis (VALIS</emphasis> §8.111), probably drawn from haphazard reading in secondary sources, is adapted not from Plato but instead conforms to doctrines of Plotinus’ Neoplatonism. Partial confirmation of this point is that Dick’s Greek is the Hellenistic <emphasis>koine (VALIS passim),</emphasis> the common Greek dialect used to write both the New Testament and the Septuagint. Dick’s reading of the Gnostics (64—69) is similiarly one-sided; <emphasis>gnosticism</emphasis> remains an umbrella term which groups together a fairly diverse set of doctrines and practices. Dick’s idenitification of <emphasis>gnosis</emphasis> and <emphasis>anamnesis</emphasis> (96) is his own position, neither Plato’s nor Plotinus’. Plotinus tried to refute the Gnostics even as they appropriated and altered his thought, just as he had done to Plato.

For example, if this were not the case the DNA code would not be able to replicate itself because it would not be able to specify itself without altering itself. Unfortunately, the self-referential paradox is one in a long list of technical ideas that have become distorted in their passage through the philosophy of criticism. It is important that Dick critics, in particular, begin to understand when and why these paradoxes become vicious, because some of Dick’s best works incorporate them.</p>

At point is the irrelevance to science of traditional “correspondence” theories of truth, favored strawmen of the French poststructuralist philosophers. The only correspondence that matters is the one that links two or more independently originating descriptions, and not a single description with some mysterious thing-in-itself. What is the likelihood that two observers, not in communication with each other, should agree about something given the infinity of possible alternatives? Much of the current debate about reference and representation thus shifts its ground to the theory of probability. In this kind of environment, poststructuralist ideas about reference tend to evaporate into thin air.</p>

   <p>15. On the hypothesis that he had not dreamed the second set of measurements, Kelvin could not have dreamed the first set unless he were clairvoyant. But how could he know he had not dreamed the second set? This is the source of the circularity in Lem’s argument.</p>
   <p>The arguments tautologous (uninformative) nature can, however, be removed by recasting it in decision-theoretical rather than strictly inferential terms. The point is that if it is the case Kelvin did not dream the second set of calculations, then the result of his experiment would provide him a basis for deciding actions that he would not otherwise possess. In particular, should both sets match—as happens in the story—Kelvin would be advised to act <emphasis>as if</emphasis> he had not dreamed the first set. Leaving the question open simply because he might have dreamed the first set could result in a bad conclusion. The test is asymmetrical in its force, just as is Dick’s in “Shell Game”: In some cases Kelvin can prove he is dreaming, but he can never prove the contrary.</p>
   <p>Under what circumstances should Kelvin be able to infer he’s been dreaming? In the first place, he must assume that if he were awake at the times both calculations were made they would have matched, and that the satellite and space station computers are both accurate in reality. (But what is the epistemological basis of this premise? Was it determined in dream or in reality?)</p>
   <p>In the second place, Kelvin knows that he was either dreaming or awake at the time the two calculations were compared. If he were dreaming, then the case is already demonstrated. Suppose he was awake and that the two calculations did not match. At what point, and by what means, did he then pass from the dream to the wakeful state? If he were awake at the time of the second calculation, then how is it possible that the earlier dream calculation got placed in a real drawer so it might really be compared with the later one? It seems paradoxical to say that a fictional object and a real one can be compared in reality.</p>
   <p>There is no paradox here; we have simply confused the phenomenological and ontological aspects of the dream. Kelvin dreams he is receiving data from the satellite and dreams he’s not looking at it, while at the same time in reality, quite unconsciously, writing down a nonsensical sequence of numbers (automatic writing). He then dreams he is transferring these figures to the drawer while simultaneously, in reality, transferring them to the drawer. In principle there is no reason a somnambulist cannot dream he is doing what in fact he is doing. If the dream surrounding the initial calculation were sufficiently vivid, it need not have been qualitatively distinguishable from the waking state. Kelvin might have then passed imperceptibly from the one state to the other, or else have simply been amnesic for the moment of transition. He could have then completed the experiment and concluded he was dreaming when he ordered the satellite computation.</p>
   <p>Perhaps the larger question is whether it makes sense to ask the present-tense question “Am I dreaming?” If one is dreaming, to whom is one addressing the question? One’s dream self? Some personality in one’s dream? But if it is not possible even in principle for the dream listener to answer the question, is it a question at all? Maybe this was the import of Wittgenstein’s last words, written as he lay dying: “Someone who, dreaming, says ‘I am dreaming,’ even if he speaks audibly in doing so, is no more right than if he said ‘it is raining’ while it is in fact raining. Even if his dream were actually connected with the sound of rain” (<emphasis>On Certainty</emphasis> 89).</p>
   <p>It is arguable that the question only acquires meaning in retrospect. Even as the waking mind (sometimes) recollects the dream, it is possible that the dreamer recollects his waking life and thus anticipates that he will wake again. He may even aspire to an enhanced state of consciousness which recollects the dream that is ordinary wakefulness, as in wakefulness he recollects ordinary dreams: but there is no test he can use to reveal that he is dreaming. Phenomenological distinctions may not help distinguish reality from the dream. Their absence is the source of much of the uncanniness in Dick’s fiction, where such boundaries are instead suggested by narrative discontinuities.</p>
   <p>In his best novels, such as <emphasis>Ubik</emphasis> and <emphasis>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch,</emphasis> Dick plays many perplexing variations on this theme. Several critics have remarked on the Chinese puzzle-box nature of the nested realities to be found in these books. If one grants the premise that it only makes sense to speak about the dream one has had, rather than the dream one is having-by analogy to the hierarchy of types Bertrand Russell once constructed to resolve his own famous logical paradox—then what is one to believe when the last dream in such a sequence is also the first? And yet that is the situation Joe Chip encounters at the end of <emphasis>Ubik:</emphasis> “This was just the beginning.” It is as if the smallest Chinese box were to loop back, and consume the largest, reminding us that dreams have no size. Part of Dick’s fascination is the way in which his books remind us of other of our period’s oddest cultural artifacts, such as Godel’s theorem or Escher’s drawings (e.g., “The Endlessly Rising Staircase”). Douglas Hofstadter baptized these “strange loops” in his book <emphasis>Godel, Escher, Bach</emphasis> (1979), and Dick’s are among the strangest.</p>

This psychological matter has nothing to do with “the disappearance of the subject” in postmodern criticism, which is a phenomenon of textuality rather than of lived life. Various aspects of the ways in which the mind comes apart are treated in Michael Gazzaniga, <emphasis>The Social Brain</emphasis> (1985), especially the author’s treatment of the effects of cerebral commisurotomy surgery, and in Colin Ross, <emphasis>Multiple Personality Disorder: Diagnosis, Clinical Features and Treatment</emphasis> (1989), which discusses the functional dissociations of MPD (now referred to as dissociative identity disorder [DID]).</p>

   <p>17. It might be argued, for example, that randomizing the values of <emphasis>R</emphasis> and A? at the experiments inception would make it impossible to prearrange an answering strategy. But this simply mistakes the relevant meaning of <emphasis>prearrangement.</emphasis> The best way to prearrange that the experimental outcome should look random is for the “conspirators” to in fact answer randomly over the reduced choice set, for any values of <emphasis>R</emphasis> and <emphasis>N.</emphasis> One effect of Dick’s approach in “Shell Game” is to define paranoia in terms of the projection of simulations and chance. In nature the purpose of a predator’s camouflage is to simulate the mean distribution of background objects so it will not be visible to its prey; one aspect of human paranoia derives from this hunter’s psychology.</p>

Wartofsky puts it, “everything is like everything else in an infinite number of respects and different from everything else in an infinite number of respects” <emphasis>(Conceptual Foundations of Scientific Thought</emphasis> 129). A circle is simultaneously a closed curve, a convex curve, a curve of constant width, a curve possessing infinitely many axes of symmetry, a curve of algebraic degree 2, etc., <emphasis>ad infinitum.</emphasis> Two circles of different radii differ from each other in infinitely many different arc lengths subtended by infinitely many distinct central angles. How, then, are we supposed to imagine that the learning of “circularity” ever takes place? How do we come to understand the meanings of rules and categories, in the sense of standard practice?</p>
   <p>If the <emphasis>a priori</emphasis> probabilities are equal that each of infinitely many examples belongs to a given set of finite measure, then they are all equal to zero. Only if the infinite sum of such a sequence of probabilities is finitely covergent can learning take place; but this requires that the probabilities themselves be listable in some monotonically decreasing order, like the decreasing increments by which Achilles gains on the tortoise in Zeno’s paradoxical fable. It is exactly on this reef that Wittgenstein’s treatment of rule learning founders in his <emphasis>Philosophical Investigations</emphasis>; he is unable to explain how it is that different language games are ever learned, given that we are not born playing them. It is through learning theory—a subject greeted with blank stares by legions of postmodern relativists, conventionalists and sociologists of knowledge—that basic realism must inevitably return to the theory of knowledge.</p>

It seems to me that Rickman’s biographical interpretations and psychoanalytical speculations highlight how difficult it is to interpret the stories by the life: we are left wondering why one whose life was apparently so painful and bizarre could have written stories which express insight into general social conditions. Either the whole society was to some degree unbalanced—which is distinctly plausible—or Dick’s particular history is of less importance to understanding his works than Rickman assumes.

This contrast is developed in <emphasis>The World Jones Made</emphasis> (1956): We have the “drifters,” alien entities who, when they randomly arrive on earth, are incinerated by mobs incited by Jones (lynch mobs, in metaphor); Jones is locked into linear purposiveness because of his power to predict the future—a sterile power, which renders him grim and miserable. The contrast between the random drifters and the linear Jones is varied in the final scenes on Venus, where the junction of a drifter and a “wad” reveals that the drifters were actually intergalactic pollen, relying on chance to bring about a conjunction with their complement and give birth to a complete organism. Here the contrast is between the drifters, whose nature is thus revealed, and the inhabitants of “the Refuge,” terrans laboriously mutated to adapt to life on Venus.</p>

   <p>4. “Pigspurt” names a particularly difficult entity in Dick’s thought, a discussion of which will have to await other occasions. The name is a pun on “Sowjet,” the German spelling of “Soviet,” and thus would apparently indicate an aspect of Dick’s unconscious, perhaps even an autonomous persona, which Dick believed could be disinhibited, that is, called forth, by Soviet influence. In <emphasis>Dream Makers</emphasis> he told Charles Platt, “This rational mind [which invaded my mind] was not human . . . . Sometimes I would think it was the Soviet Union Academy of Sciences trying out their pyschotronic microwave telepathic transmitter” (155).</p>

   <p>11. Girard’s description of “possession” turns out to be quite similar to Jung’s concept of “dissimulation,” in that both describe one aspect of possession as being derived from projective identification. The fear of entrapment leads to dissociation rather than association (as in dissimulation). Dissociation is best described as the “possum response,” an <emphasis>imitatio morte,</emphasis> or a “splitting off” of autonomous personalities. Jung refers to dissociation as a “means of adaptation” <emphasis>(Works</emphasis> 6:206). In a somewhat different discussion (in a book Dick probably read), Norman O. Brown, in <emphasis>Life Against Death</emphasis> (1959), in the context of his own discussion of the Apollonian and the Dionysian (Chapter XII), discusses projective identification, or dissimulation, using Freudian concepts and terminology. The cognate process Brown (following Freud) names an effect of the “narcissistic libido” (162).</p>

   <p>13. René Girard writes that “only Dostoevsky . . . in his early novel <emphasis>The Double</emphasis> . . . set forth in concrete terms the elements of reciprocity at work in the proliferation of monsters” (161). I would argue that Philip Dick writes about mimetic desire in an equally compelling way. In a slightly different approach, Louis Breger, in <emphasis>Dostoevsky: The Writer as Psychoanalyst,</emphasis> notes that the “ ‘splitting’ of the personality in <emphasis>The Double</emphasis> does not resemble the more popularly known cases of ‘split’ or multiple personality” but rather is an example of “the relatively rare autoscopic phenomenon,” in which there “is an encounter with a visual hallucination of oneself.” He concludes that it is likely that Dostoevsky “had firsthand acquaintance with the phenomenon,” as autoscopic phenomena are “associated with brain injury or temporal-lobe epilepsy” (269n1). Given that Philip Dick suffered a brain injury of undetermined severity in 1964 and that it has been hypothesized that he may have had temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), one wonders if Dick himself had firsthand acquaintance with the autoscopic phenomenon. See Breger’s footnote for references to the relevant psychiatric literature. Of course, in “The Double,” Golyadkin’s hallucinations are autoscopic, of Self rather than Other, the latter being the case with Dick’s “Upon the Dull Earth.” Obviously an autoscopic hallucination must be the anamnesis of the body image as previously seen in a mirror. If Dick suffered this kind of neurologically based hallucination, then it suggests that when he looked in the mirror, he sometimes saw another person. In fact, there is a scene in <emphasis>Solar Lottery</emphasis> (1955) in which precisely this event happens, to the character Ted Benteley (§6.67−68). The Greek myths of Narcissus, Nemesis and Echo are unavoidable associations; the image obsession in “Upon the Dull Earth” is transferred from Self to Other, but—most importantly—the solipsistic nature of the theme is otherwise unchanged.</p>

   <p>15. I am not by any means suggesting that Dick was schizophrenic, even though he himself, given the psychiatric profiles of 1930s and 1940s, was diagnosed as and believed himself to be such. It is true that many of his symptoms would indicate a diagnosis of schizophrenia, but it is also true that much of his behavior contraindicated this diagnosis.

Kasanin is working with the formulation of Vigotsky and Luria that in the child there are “usually three stages” in development of thought: the physiognomic (animating objects and projecting the child’s ego into them); then “concrete” thinking” (“realistic and literal”), and lastly abstract thinking (41−42). Note the elitist aspect that pervades the book—for example, “uneducated” people whose categorical thinking is limited (42)—which in turn fits in with Tim Archer’s obsession with books and Bill Lundborg’s with cars. Ultimately Dick is allied with his Isidores rather than his Archers, or other “big domes” (cf. <emphasis>Our Friends from Prolix 8</emphasis> [1970]).</p>

To abandon her [your wife] would be to say, I can’t endure reality as such. I have to have uniquely special easier conditions” (§13.2). Note also that the Bodhisattva chooses compassion over wisdom; and Barefoot [grounded literally] provides the sandwich to go with the ideas. See also Binswanger’s discusion in “The Case of Ellen West” of three worlds: the grounded world of “practical action”; the “ethereal” of “highest ideals”; and the third world, beneath the earth, of encumbered desire (274−77). To the third of these worlds is appended a note to Schiller’s play about Wallenstein, which figures significantly in <emphasis>Timothy Archer.</emphasis> The reference to Ellen West needing to be rescued from “a world out of joint” (276) I take to be a fortuitous coincidence. Yet it’s instructive to follow Binswanger’s imagery, that Ellen is struggling in this world so “out of joint” to keep “both feet firmly on the ground.” The “laborious building up a world in little things is constantly ‘opposed by the temptation of effortlessly flying” in the realm of the “ethereal.” The term “ethereal,” Ellen West’s own term, becomes Dick’s term for the wish for escape from problems in the here and now. As such it is associated with emigration off-planet, or Thisbe Holt’s space brothel, and the Wind God, George Walt in <emphasis>The Crack in Space.</emphasis> Jack Isidore’s moving closer in to the center in <emphasis>Do Androids Dream</emphasis> is the opposite movement.</p>

An additional note: I think Dick would have considered the androids schizophrenic, but they might instead be regarded clinically as psychopaths, who also show an absence of normal affect. I am, however, steering clear of current psychiatric views of mental illness. What nevertheless is clear is that the androids as a class are lacking in empathy, which follows from their abstractedness. Dick would most likely perceive caring (or empathy) as a concrete response to a fellow being.</p>

   <p>29. In <emphasis>We Can Build You</emphasis> Dick also cites the work of Olds and Jacobson. Jacobson I have not identified (unless Dick is thinking of Penfield’s predecessor, Hughlings Jackson). But Old is James Olds, author of <emphasis>The Growth and Structure of Motives</emphasis> (1956), on S/R (stimulus/response) psychology. As a quasi-appendix, Olds presents “A Brief Model of the Association System of the Brain,” which describes a <emphasis>“recording strand</emphasis> immersed in the brain field, which is a series of recording units” (260). By “recording strand” he means generically “a long narrow series of recording elements such as the wire of a wire recorder, the tape of a tape recorder, the filmstrip of a motion picture recorder, the groove of a phonograph record, and so forth” (262). This description sounds like Garson Poole’s tape in Dick’s story “The Electric Ant” (1969). Olds surmises that “the recording strand in the brain is a preformed contact chain of neurons in the association area,” with “each neuron [being] . . . a recording unit, and that one neuron becomes specified or fixed at each moment of time” (263). In “Ant” Dick reverses the analogy. In Poole (an android), the strip is prerecorded; and reality derives (paradoxically) from the strip. When Poole fiddles with his strip (i.e., his brain), reality is modified.</p>

In his 1972 Vancouver speech, “The Android and the Human” (in Gillespie), Dick, playing with notions of totalitarianism, writes, “I wonder of you recall the so-called ‘brain-mapping’ developed by Penfield recently; he was able to locate the exact centres of the brain from which each sensation, emotion, and response came. By stimulating one minute area with an electrode, a laboratory rat was transfigured into a state of perpetual bliss. They’ll be doing that to all of us, too, soon,’ a pessimistic friend said to me, regarding that. ‘Once the electrodes have been implanted, They can get us to feel, think, do anything They want”’ (60). Dick goes on to describe an absurd scenario where, because of shoddy manufacturing of electrodes, the “Washington DC Thought Control Centre would overload . . . and set fire to the White House.”</p>

It may be this passage that Dick recalls at the end of <emphasis>Timothy Archer</emphasis> when Bill Lundborg has Tim Archer and his ideas whizzing around in his head. “Have fun with your thoughts,” thinks Angel. “That is what Harry Stack Sullivan said schizophrenics do: they have endless fun with their thoughts and forget the world” (§15.1). If Sullivan says that, I don’t know where he does it. Did Dick know Svillivan’s <emphasis>The Interpersonal Theory of Psychiatry</emphasis> (1953), which in Part III deals with mental disorders? Dick does in fact mention Sullivan in <emphasis>Time Out of Joint,</emphasis> when Ragle is apprehensive, imagining Bill Black catching him having an affair with his wife Junie: “Guilt transformed . . . fantasy of doom as a just payment for my transgressions.” Ragle thinks that this is what “the psychiatrist would say,” and “all the wives, having read Harry Stack Sullivan, Karen Homey, and Karl Menninger” (§11.2). There are also several references to Sigmund Freud in the novel, but they are commonplaces: such as that Freud says “there’s always a psychological reason” (§5.4). Clearly, Dick has been reading. Also note “The Mold of Yancy” (1955), where Dick has transformed an un<emphasis>-Kindly Dad-</emphasis>ish Yancy who now reads <emphasis>The Journal of Psychological Review</emphasis> instead of <emphasis>Dog Stories Monthly.</emphasis></p>

I would, however, like to suggest that the matriarchal system in <emphasis>The Simulacra</emphasis> (1964) resembles a courtly model. In fact, Douglas A. Mackey points this out: “The artists in the novel are as caught up in the general delusion as anyone else . . . . Their obsession is similar to Louis’ with Pris in <emphasis>We Can Build You”</emphasis> (65). Dick himself has remarked on the comparison between Rachel Rosen and Pris: We also see an android named Pris in <emphasis>Do Androids Dream.</emphasis> In <emphasis>A Scanner Darkly</emphasis> (1977), Novalis’s mystic blue flower appears at the end, and we also see the deceptive nature of love when Donna Hawthorne, Bob Arctor’s girlfriend, turns out to be an undercover narcotics agent-another variation on the theme of unrequited love.</p>

However, the moral of the speech at York was rather different than Lantano’s: since we know nothing of the darkness before or after the flight through the hall, a doctrine that promises reliable information should be accepted.

The problem of Dick’s Marxism is complicated not only by his apparent failure to understand the definitions of the term in use by Disch and others like Jameson and Fitting and by his conflation of Marxism and Communism in the Rickman interview, but by Dick’s private assertion in the <emphasis>Exegesis:</emphasis> “Glanced over SOLAR LOTTERY &amp; Tom Disch’s intro; he’s right. I was/am the sole Marxist S-F writer. I may not have been/am CP [Communist Party], but the basic Marxist sociological view of capitalism—negative—is there” (Lawrence Sutin, Ed., <emphasis>In Pursuit of VALIS</emphasis> 175). These comments, written three years before the Rickman interview, demonstrate Dick’s inconsistent views of Marxism and Communism, of the definitions applied to the terms, and of his views regarding his own work.</p>

   <p>9. While <emphasis>Eye in the Sky</emphasis> was published as Dick’s fourth novel in 1957, records at Scott Meredith Literary Agency (SMLA) show that the manuscript was submitted on February 15, 1955, indicating that it is the third in order of composition after <emphasis>Solar Lottery</emphasis> (received in March, 1954) and <emphasis>The World Jones Made</emphasis> (received December, 1954). <emphasis>The Man Who Japed,</emphasis> published in 1956, was submitted in October, 1955, and <emphasis>The Cosmic Puppets,</emphasis> an expansion of the short story “A Glass of Darkness” (first published in 1953) was submitted in May, 1957. See Appendix B of Rickman’s <emphasis>To the High Castle.</emphasis> Most important here, of course, is that these dates establish <emphasis>Eye in the Sky’s</emphasis> composition as contemporaneous with Dick’s writing of <emphasis>Mary and the Giant,</emphasis> which was also first submitted to SMLA in early 1955.</p>

   <p>11. While <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> is correctly viewed as an expansion of the much shorter <emphasis>Cantata 140,</emphasis> published as a novella in the July 1964 <emphasis>Fantasy and Science Fiction,</emphasis> it has even earlier roots in the short story “Prominent Author,” first published in May 1954 in <emphasis>If.</emphasis> In that story, Henry Ellis, a New York businessman working for Terr an Development, discovers a dimensional rift in the jiffi-scuttler that he is testing for the company. The device is essentially a transportation tunnel that allow Ellis to commute over 160 miles to New York in only five steps. Ultimately, he discovers that the rift looks into an earlier time in earth’s history and that the tiny beings whom he communicates with through the hazy thin spot in the jiffi-scuttler’s wall are actually ancient Hebrews living in an accelerated time relative to his own. Ellis adopts the role of the Old Testament God and writes the Bible, which he gifts to his own past. The story is briefly summarized in <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> as an “incredible legend” repeated by ‘scuttler repairmen (§2.18−19). Throughout my analysis, I cite the 1977 Metheun paperback edition.</p>

   <p>12. While neither Paul Williams nor Gregg Rickman has been able to document precisely the dates of <emphasis>Counter-Clock Worlds</emphasis> completion or receipt by the Scott Meredith Agency, Williams estimates that Dick completed the novel in “late 1965” (<emphasis>Only Apparently Real</emphasis> 182). In the following discussion, all citations refer to the Berkley edition of May 1974.</p>

   <p>13. The lack of critical address to these novels, of course, is due in part to a lack of reprints, for neither <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> nor <emphasis>Counter-Clock World</emphasis> has been reprinted in nearly two decades in the United States. Even now, when some of Dick’s lesser novels such as <emphasis>Solar Lottery</emphasis> and <emphasis>The World Jones Made</emphasis> are available in recent editions, <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> and <emphasis>Counter-Clock World</emphasis> remain out of print in this country. So, early negative critical judgment has resulted in little or no commentary on the novels despite their somewhat significant positions in both Dick’s personal and professional development. <emphasis>The Crack in Space</emphasis> is the last novel he wrote while living with Anne Dick and was completed just before their separation, while <emphasis>Counter-Clock World,</emphasis> according to Dick, is the first novel written during his romance with Nancy Hackett just after his move back to Berkeley. The latter novel, then, is the first in which Dick moves, according to Rickman, “from the multi-character plots of the 60s to the Third Period plots centering around two to four people” <emphasis>(IHOW 170).</emphasis> Regardless of their quality, then, these two novels should be of interest to scholars investigating Dick’s work. Because critical rejection has resulted in their general lack of availability, I will present somewhat detailed plot summaries while discussing them, both to assist readers in following the argument and to generate greater interest in them and their issues.</p>
