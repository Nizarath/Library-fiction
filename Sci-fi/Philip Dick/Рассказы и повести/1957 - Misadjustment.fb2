    <p>Misadjustment</p>
    <p>by Philip K. Dick</p>
   </title>
   <p>When Richards got home from work he had a secret little routine he went through, a pleasant series of actions that brought him more satisfaction than his ten-hour workday at the Commerce Institute. He tossed his briefcase into a chair, rolled up his sleeves, grabbed a squirt-tank of liquid fertilizer, and kicked open the back door. Cool late-evening sunlight filtered down on him as he stepped gingerly across the moist black soil to the center of the garden. His heart thudded excitedly; how was it coming?</p>
   <p>Fine. Growing bigger every day.</p>
   <p>He watered it, tore off a few old leaves, spaded up the soil, killed a weed that had edged in, squirted fertilizer at random, and then stepped back to survey it. There was no satisfaction like that of creative activity. On the job he was a high-paid cog in the niplan economic system; he worked with verbal signs, and somebody else’s signs at that. Here, he dealt directly with reality.</p>
   <p>Richards squatted on his haunches and surveyed what he had accomplished. It was a good sight; almost ready, almost fully grown. He leaned forward to poke cautiously at the firm sides.</p>
   <p>In the dwindling light of day the high-velocity transport glittered dully. Its windows had already formed: four pale squares in the tapered metal hull. The control bubble was just starting to burgeon from the center of the chassis. The jet flanges were full and developed. The input hatch and emergency lock hadn’t grown into existence, yet; but it wouldn’t be long.</p>
   <p>Richards’ satisfaction rose to fever-pitch. No doubt about it: the transport was almost ripe. Any day now he could pick it . . . and start flying it around.</p>
   <p>At nine the waitingroom had been full of people and cigaret smoke; now, at three-thirty, it was almost empty. One by one the visitors had given up and departed. Discarded tapes, bulging ashtrays, empty chairs surrounded the robot desk industriously grinding out its mechanical business. But in one corner, sitting bolt upright, her small hands clasped around her purse, remained a last young woman the desk hadn’t been able to discourage.</p>
   <p>The desk tried once more. It was getting close to four; Eggerton would soon be leaving. The gross irrationality of waiting for a man about to put on his hat and coat and go home grated against the desk’s sensitive nerves. And the girl had been sitting there since nine, eyes large and wide, gazing at nothing, not smoking or examining tapes, only sitting and waiting.</p>
   <p>“Look, lady,” the desk said aloud, “there’s nobody going to see Mr. Eggerton today.”</p>
   <p>The girl smiled slightly. “It’ll only take a minute.”</p>
   <p>The desk sighed. “You’re persistent. What do you want? Your firm must do a spectacular business with jobbers like you—but as I said, Mr. Eggerton never buys anything. That’s how he got where he is, by throwing people like you out. I suppose you think that figure of yours is going to get you a big order.” The desk added peevishly, “You ought to be ashamed, wearing a dress like that. A nice girl like you.”</p>
   <p>“He’ll see me,” the girl answered faintly.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>The desk whizzed forms through its scanner and searched for a double entendre on the word <emphasis>see.</emphasis> “Yes, I suppose with a dress like that,” it began, but at that moment the inner door lifted and John Eggerton appeared.</p>
   <p>“Turn yourself off,” he ordered the desk: “I’m going home. Set yourself for ten; I’ll be late tomorrow. The id bloc is holding a policy level conference in Pittsburgh, and I have a few things to say to them while they’re together.”</p>
   <p>The girl slid to her feet. John Eggerton was a huge, ape-shouldered man, shaggy and unkempt, his jacket hanging open and food-stained, sleeves rolled up, eyes deep-set and dark with industrial cunning. He peered at her warily as she approached.</p>
   <p>“Mr. Eggerton,” she said, “do you have a moment? There’s something I want to discuss with you.”</p>
   <p>“I’m not buying and I’m not hiring.” Eggerton’s voice was gruff with fatigue. “Young lady, go back to your employer and tell them if they want to show me something to send around an experienced representative, not a kid just out of . . .”</p>
   <p>Eggerton was nearsighted. It wasn’t until the girl was almost to him that he saw the card between her fingers. For a man of his size he moved with astonishing agility; with one leap he knocked the girl aside, dashed around the robot desk, and disappeared through a side exit from the office. The girl’s purse clattered to the floor, its contents spilling wildly. She hesitated between them and the door, then with an exasperated hiss, rushed from the office and out into the hall. The express elevator to the roof showed red; it was already on its way up fifty stories to the building’s private field.</p>
   <p>“Damn,” the girl said. She turned and reentered the office, seething with disgust.</p>
   <p>The desk had begun to recover. “Why didn’t you tell me you’re an Immune?” it demanded. Its outrage grew—the indignation of a bureaucrat. “I gave you form s045 to fill out and line six distinctly asked for specific information on your occupation. You—<emphasis>deceived</emphasis> me!”</p>
   <p>The girl ignored the desk and knelt down to collect her things. Gun, magnetic bracelet, intercom neck-mike, lipstick, keys, mirror, small change, handkerchief, the twenty-four hour notice intended for John Eggerton . . . she was going to get hell when she appeared back at the Agency. Eggerton had even managed to avoid oral acknowledgment: the spool of recording tape spilled from her purse was blank and useless.</p>
   <p>“You’ve got a clever boss,” she said to the desk, in a burst of wrath. “All day sitting here in this reeking office with all these salesmen for nothing.”</p>
   <p>“I wondered why you were so persistent,” the desk said. “I never saw a saleswoman so persistent; I should have known something was wrong. You almost got him.”</p>
   <p>“We’ll get him,” the girl said, on her way out of the office. “Tell him that tomorrow, when he shows up.”</p>
   <p>“He won’t show up,” the desk answered; to itself, since the girl was gone. “He won’t ever come back here, not now. Not with you Immunes hanging around. A man’s life is worth more than his business, even a business this size.”</p>
   <p>The girl entered a public vid booth and dialed the Agency. “He skipped,” she said to the grim-faced woman who was her immediate superior. “He didn’t touch the summons-card; I guess I’m not much of a server.”</p>
   <p>“Did he see the card?”</p>
   <p>“Of course; that’s why he bolted.”</p>
   <p>The older woman scratched a few tentative lines on a note pad. “Technically, we have him. I’ll let our lawyers battle it out with his heirs; I’m going ahead with the twenty-four hour notice, just as if he accepted it. If he was wary before, he’ll be impossible from now on; we’ll never get closer than this. It’s too bad you muffed this . . .” The woman decided. “Call his home and give his personal staff the notice of culpability. Tomorrow morning we’ll release it over the regular newsmachines.”</p>
   <p>Doris broke the circuit, held her hand over the screen to clear it, and then dialed Eggerton’s personal number. To the attendant she gave the formal notice that Eggerton was legal prey for any niplan citizen. The attendant—mechanical—dutifully took the information as if it had been an order for so many dozen yards of cloth. Somehow, the machine’s calmness made her more discouraged than ever. She left the booth and wandered gloomily downramp to the cocktail bar to wait for her husband.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>John Eggerton didn’t seem like a parakineticist. Doris’ mind imagined small wan-faced youths, withdrawn and agonized, buried in out-of-the-way towns and farms, hidden away from urban areas. Eggerton was prominent . . . but of course that didn’t affect his chance of being picked up in the random check-net. As she sipped her Tom Collins, she tried to think of other reasons why John Eggerton would ignore his initial check notice, then his warning—fine and possible imprisonment—and now this, his last notice.</p>
   <p>Was Eggerton really P-K?</p>
   <p>Her face in the dark mirror behind the bar wavered, rings of half-shadows, nebulous succubi, a gloom of fog like that which lay over the niplan system. Her reflection might have been that of a young female parakineticist: black circles for eyes, moist lashes, dank hair around her thin shoulders, fingers too tapered and too sharp. But it was only the mirror; there were no distaff parakineticists. At least, none reported <emphasis>yet.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Unnoticed, her husband came up beside her, tossed his coat over a stool, and seated himself. “How did it come off?” Harvey asked sympathetically.</p>
   <p>Doris started in surprise. “You scared me!”</p>
   <p>Harvey lit a cigaret and attracted the attention of the bartender. “Bourbon and water.” He turned mildly to his wife. “Cheer up—there’re other mutants to track down.” He tossed her the foil from the afternoon newsmachines. “You probably know already, but your San Francisco office picked up four in a row. All of them unique; there was one party who had a sweet little talent of speeding up metabolic processes in those he didn’t care for.”</p>
   <p>Doris nodded absently. “We heard through the Agency memos. And one could walk through walls, without falling through floors. And one animated stones.”</p>
   <p>“Eggerton got away?”</p>
   <p id="_bookmark2">“Like lightning—I wouldn’t think a man that big would react that fast. But maybe he isn’t a man.” She spun her tall cold glass between her fingers. “The Agency is going to give the public twenty-four hour notice. I’ve already called his home . . . that gives his personal staff a head start.”</p>
   <p>“They ought to have it. After all, they’ve been working for him; they ought to have first crack at the bounty.” Harvey was trying to be funny, but his wife didn’t respond. “You think a man that big can hide out?”</p>
   <p>Doris shrugged. The problem was simple with the ones who hid; they gave themselves away by departing more and more from the behavior norm. It was the ones unaware of their innate difference, those who kept on functioning until discovered by accident . . . the so-called <emphasis>unconscious</emphasis> P-K’s had forced into existence the random check system and its Agency of female Immunes. In Doris’ mind, the weird thought crept that a man might not be P-K and think he was—the timeless neurotic fear that one was somehow different, odd-ball, when in fact one was quite normal. Eggerton, for all his industrial power and influence, might be an ordinary human being suffering from a gnawing phobia that be was P-K. Such had happened . . . and there were genuine P-K’s wandering around blithely unaware of their alienness.</p>
   <p>“We need a sure-fire test,” Doris said aloud. “Something an individual can apply on himself. So he can be <emphasis>certain.”</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Don’t you have it? Can’t you be positive when you get hold of them in your net?”</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>If</emphasis> we get hold of them. One out of ten thousand. Too damn small a number come up in the nets.” Abruptly she pushed away her drink and got to her feet. “Let’s go home. I’m hungry and tired; I want to go to bed.”</p>
   <p>Harvey gathered up his coat as he paid the tab. “Sorry, honey, We’re going out for dinner tonight. A fellow in the Commerce Institute, a man named Jay Richards. I met him at t luncheon . . . as a matter of fact, you were along. We’re all invited over to celebrate something.”</p>
   <p>“Celebrate what?” Doris demanded irritably. “What do we have to celebrate?”</p>
   <p>“Something secret of his,” Harvey answered, as he pushed open the wide street door. “He’s going to spring it on us after dinner. Cheer up—it may be good for an evening’s entertainment.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Eggerton did not fly directly home. At high velocity he circled aimlessly near the first ring of residential syndromes at the edge of New York, his mind ebbing first with terror, then with outrage. His natural impulse was to head for his own lands and houses, but fear of running into more Agency servers paralyzed his will. While he was trying to make up his mind, his neck—mike came on with the relay of the Agency’s call.</p>
   <p>He was lucky. The girl had given the twenty-four hour notice to one of his robots; and robots weren’t interested in bounty.</p>
   <p>He landed on a randomly-selected roof field within the industrial area of Pittsburgh. No one saw him: lucky again. He was trembling as he entered the descent elevator, and began the trip down to the street level. With him were crowded a blankfaced clerk, two elderly women, a serious young man, and the pretty daughter of some minor official. A harmless clump of people, but he wasn’t fooled; at the end of twenty-four hours any and all of them would be panting for his hide. And he couldn’t blame them: ten million dollars was a lot of money.</p>
   <p>Theoretically, he had a one-day grace period; but final notices were badly-kept secrets. Most higher-ups were undoubtedly in on it; he’d approach an old friend, be welcomed, wined and dined, given a cabin-shelter on Ganymede and plenty of supplies—and be shot between the eyes as soon as the day was up.</p>
   <p>He had remote units of his own industrial combine, of course; but they’d be checked off systematically. He had a variety of holding companies, dummy corporations, but the Agency would run through them if they considered it worth their time. The intuitive realization that he could easily become an object lesson to the niplan system, manipulated and exploited by the Agency, drove him to a frenzy. The female Immunes had always tripped deep-buried complexes built up in his mind from early infancy; the thought of a matriarchal culture was vitally abhorrent to him. And to pick off Eggerton was to unfasten a basic pivot of the bloc: now it occurred to him that his number on the random check might not really be random after all.</p>
   <p>Clever—compile the identifying serial numbers of the id bloc leaders, revolve them in the check-nets from time to time, gradually eliminate them one by one.</p>
   <p>He reached the street level and stood undecided, as urban traffic flowed around him noisily. Suppose the id bloc leaders simply cooperated with the check-nets? Compliance with the initial notice meant only a routine mind-probe by the protected corps of mutants society sanctioned, the telepathic <emphasis>castrati</emphasis> tolerated because of their usefulness against other mutants. Fulled at random or by design, the victim could simply permit the probe, lay his mind bare to the Agency, let the battleaxes claw and peck over the contents of his psyche, and then return to his office, cleared and safe. But this posited one item: that the industrial leader could pass the probe, that he was not P-K.</p>
   <p>Sweat stood out on Eggerton’s heavy forehead. Wasn’t he, in a roundabout way, telling himself that he <emphasis>was</emphasis> P-K? No, that wasn’t it. The issue was a principle; the Agency had no moral right to probe the half-dozen men whose industrial bloc was the mainstay of the Niplan system. On that point every id bloc leader agreed with him . . . an attack on Eggerton was an assault on the bloc itself.</p>
   <p>Fervently, he prayed they <emphasis>would</emphasis> see it that way. He hailed a robot taxi and ordered: “Get me over to the id bloc hall. And if anybody tries to halt you, fifty dollars says keep going.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>The vast, echoing hall was dark and gloomy when he reached it. The meeting wouldn’t begin for several days, yet; Eggerton wandered aimlessly up and down the aisles, between the rows of seats where the technological and clerical staffs of the various industrial units would be placed, past the steel and plastic benches where the leaders themselves sat, up finally to the vacant speaker’s stand. Faint lights glowed for him as he halted vaguely before the marble stand. The futility of his position came to him with a rush: standing here in this empty hall, he momentarily comprehended how completely he had made himself an outcast. He could yell and shout and nobody would appear. He could summon up nobody and nothing; the Agency was the legal government of the niplan system. In tilting with it he had placed himself against all organized society—powerful as he was he couldn’t hope to defeat society itself.</p>
   <p>He left the hall hurriedly, located an expensive restaurant, and enjoyed a lavish dinner. Almost feverishly, he downed immense quantities of scarce imported delicacies; at least he could enjoy his last twenty-four hours. As he ate he gazed apprehensively at the waiters and the other diners. Bland, indifferent faces—but very soon they would see his number and image on every newsmachine. The great hunt would be on; billions of hunters after one quarry. Abruptly, he finished his meal, examined his watch, and left the restaurant. It was six in the evening.</p>
   <p>For an hour he squandered himself furiously in a swank bed girl mart, going from one apartment to the next, only half-seeing the occupants. He left behind a chaos—for which he paid; and then abandoned the frenetic turmoil for the fresh air of the evening streets. Until eleven he wandered through the dark star-lit parks that surrounded the residential area of the city, among other dim shadows, his hands stuffed miserably in his pockets, hunched over, wretched. Somewhere far off a city clock-tower radiated an audio time signal. The twenty-four hours were leaking out and no one could stop them.</p>
   <p>At eleven-thirty he halted his purposeless wanderings and pulled himself together long enough to analyze his situation. He had to face it: his only chance lay back at the id bloc hall. The technological and clerical staffs wouldn’t have begun to show, but most of the leaders would be staking out preferred living quarters. His wristmap showed that he had drifted five miles from the hall. Suddenly terrified, he made his decision.</p>
   <p>He flew directly back to the hall, landed on the deserted roof field, and descended to the floor of living quarters. It couldn’t be put off: it was now or never.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>“Come in, John,” Townsand invited good-naturedly, and then his expression changed as Eggerton briefly outlined what had taken place in his office.</p>
   <p>“You say they’ve already sent the final notice to your home?” Laura Townsand asked quickly. She had got up from the couch where she had been sitting and come immediately to the door. “Then it’s too late!”</p>
   <p>Eggerton tossed his overcoat to the closet and sank down in an easy chair. “Too late? Maybe . . . too late to avoid the notice; but I’m not giving up.”</p>
   <p>Townsand and the other id bloc leaders came around Eggerton, faces showing curiosity, sympathy, and traces of cold amusement. “You’ve really got yourself into something,” one of the leaders said. “If you’d let us know before the final notice was sent out maybe we could have done something. But this late. . . .”</p>
   <p>Eggerton strangled as he felt the boom being lowered down around him. “Wait,” he said thickly, “let’s get this straight. We’re all in this together; it’s me today and you tomorrow. If I fold under this—”</p>
   <p>“Take it easy,” murmured voices came. “Let’s work this out rationally or not at all.”</p>
   <p>Eggerton lay back against the chair as it adjusted to his tired body. Yes, he was glad to work it out rationally.</p>
   <p>“As I see it,” Townsand said quietly, leaning forward, his fingers pressed together, “it’s not really a question of <emphasis>can</emphasis> we neutralize the Agency. Collectively, we’re the economic battery of the niplan system; if we draw the props out from under the Agency it collapses. The real question is—do we <emphasis>want</emphasis> to write off the Agency?”</p>
   <p>Eggerton croaked wildly: “Good God, it’s either us or them! Can’t you see they’re using this net-check and probe system to undermine us?”</p>
   <p>Townsand glanced at him and then continued for the benefit of the other leaders. “Perhaps we’re forgetting something. <emphasis>We</emphasis> set up the Agency in the first place; that is, the id bloc before us worked out the fundamentals of random net-check inspection, use of tame telepaths. the final notice and hunt—the whole works. <emphasis>The Agency is for out protection;</emphasis> otherwise parakineticists would grow like weeds and finally choke us off. Of course, we must keep control of the Agency . . . it’s our instrument.”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” another leader agreed. “We can’t let it get on our backs; Eggerton Is certainly right, there.” “We can assume,” Townsand continued, “that some mechanism must exist at all times to detect P-K’s. If the Agency goes, something must be constructed in its place. Now I tell you what, John.” He gazed thoughtfully at Eggerton. “If you can think of a substitute, then maybe we’ll be interested. But if not, then the Agency stands. Since the first P-K back in 2045, only females have shown immunity. Whatever we set up will have to be operated from a female policy-board . . . and that’s the Agency all over again.”</p>
   <p>There was silence.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Dimly, in Eggerton’s mind, the ghosts of hope flickered. “You agree the Agency is on our backs?” he demanded huskily. “All right, we have to assert ourselves.” He gestured around the room futilely; the leaders were watching stonily and Laura Townsand was quietly pouring coffee into half-empty cups. She shot him a glance of mute sympathy and then turned back to the kitchen. Cold silence cut down around Eggerton; he settled unhappily back in his chair and listened to Townsand drone on.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry you didn’t inform us that your number had come up,” Townsand was saying. “On the first notice we could have done something, but not now. Not unless we want to have a showdown at this time—and I don’t think we’re prepared for that.” He pointed his authoritative finger at Eggerton. “You know, John, I don’t think you really understand what these P-K individuals are. You probably think of them as lunatics, people with delusions.”</p>
   <p>“I know what they are,” Eggerton answered stiffly. But he couldn’t keep himself from saying, <emphasis>“Aren’t</emphasis> they people with delusions?”</p>
   <p>“They’re lunatics who have the power to actualize their delusional systems in space-time. They warp a limited area around them to conform to their eccentric notions—understand? <emphasis>The P-K makes his delusion work.</emphasis> Therefore in a sense it isn’t a delusion . . . not unless you can stand far enough back, get a long way off and compare his warped area with the world proper. But how can the P-K himself do that? He has no objective standard; he can’t very well get away from himself, and the warp follows him wherever he goes. The really dangerous P-K’s are the ones who think everybody can animate stones, or change themselves into animals, or transmute base minerals. If we let a P-K get away, if we let him grow up, reproduce, have a family, a wife and children, we let this inherited parafaculty spread . . . it becomes a group belief . . . it becomes a socially institutionalized practice. </p>
   <p>“Any given P-K is capable of spawning a society of P-K’s built around his particular power. The great danger is this: eventually we non-P-K’s may become the minority . . . our rational world-view may come to be considered eccentric.”</p>
   <p>Eggerton licked his lips. The dry, languid voice made him sick; as Townsand spoke the ominous chill of death settled over him. “In other words,” he muttered, “you’re not going to help me.”</p>
   <p>“That’s right,” Townsand said, “But not because we don’t <emphasis>want</emphasis> to help you. We feel that the danger from the Agency is less than you imagine;, we consider the P-K’s the real menace. Find us some way we can detect them without the Agency, and we’ll go along with you—but not until then.” He leaned close to Eggerton and tapped him on the shoulder with a lean, bony finger. “If females weren’t clear of this stuff, we wouldn’t stand a chance. We’re lucky . . . we could be a lot worse off than we are.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Eggerton got slowly to his feet. “Goodnight.”</p>
   <p>Townsand also rose. There was a moment of strained, awkward silence. “However,” Townsand said, “we can beat this hunt and chase rap they have on you. There’s still time; the public notice hasn’t been put out, yet.”</p>
   <p>“What’ll I do?” Eggerton asked hopelessly.</p>
   <p>“You have the written copy of your twenty-four notice?”</p>
   <p>“No!” Eggerton’s voice cracked hysterically. “I ran cut of the office before the girl could give it to me!”</p>
   <p>Townsand pondered. “You know who she is? You know where you can find her?”</p>
   <p>“No.”</p>
   <p>“Make inquiries. Trace her down, accept the notice, then throw yourself on the mercy of the Agency.”</p>
   <p>Eggerton spread his hands numbly. “But that means I’ll be bonded to them for the rest of my life.”</p>
   <p>“You’ll be alive,” Townsand said mildly, without emotion of any kind.</p>
   <p>Laura Townsand brought steaming black coffee over to Eggerton. “Cream or sugar?” she asked gently, when she was able to attract his attention. “Or both? John, you must get something hot under your belt before you go; it’s such a long trip back.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>The girl’s name was Doris Sorrel. Her apartment was listed under the name Harvey Sorrel, her husband. There was no one there: Eggerton carbonized the door-lock, then entered and searched the four small rooms. He rooted through the dresser drawers, tossed clothing and personal articles aside one after another, systematically rifled the closets and cupboards. In the waste disposal slot by the work desk he found what he was looking for: a not-yet incinerated note, crumpled and discarded, a jotted notation with the name Jay Richards, the date and the time, the address, and the words, <emphasis>if Doris isn’t too tired.</emphasis> Eggerton put the note in his coat pocket and departed.</p>
   <p>It was three-thirty in the morning when he found them. He landed on the roof of the squat Commerce Institute Building and descended the ramp to the residential floors. From the north wing light and noise came: the party was still in session. Praying silently, Eggerton raised his hand to the door and tripped the analyzer.</p>
   <p>The man who opened the door was handsome, gray-haired, a heavy man in his late thirties. A glass in one hand, he gazed blankly at Eggerton, his eyes blurred with fatigue and alcohol. “I don’t remember inviting—” he began, but Eggerton pushed past him and into the apartment.</p>
   <p>There were plenty of people. Sitting, standing, keeping up a low murmur of talk and laughter. Liquor, soft couches, thick perfumes and fabrics, shifting color-walls, robots serving hors d’oeuvres, the muted cacophony of feminine giggles from darkened siderooms . . . Eggerton slid off his coat and moved aimlessly around. She was there somewhere; he glanced from face to face, saw only vacant, half-gazed eyes and slack mouths, then abruptly left the livingroom and entered a bedroom.</p>
   <p>Doris Sorrel was standing at a window gazing silently out at the lights of the city, her back to him, one arm resting on the window sill. “Oh,” she murmured, turning a little. “Already?” And then she saw who it was.</p>
   <p>“I want it,” Eggerton said. “The twenty-four hour notice; I’ll take it, now.”</p>
   <p>“You scared me.” Trembling she moved away from the wide expanse of window. “How—long have you been here?”</p>
   <p>“I just came.”</p>
   <p>“But—<emphasis>why?</emphasis> You’re a strange person, Mr. Eggerton. You don’t make sense.” She laughed nervously. “I don’t understand you at all.”</p>

   <p>From the gloom the figure of a man emerged, briefly outlined in the doorway. “Darling, here’s your martini.” The man made out Eggerton, and an ugly expression settled over his half-stupefied face. “Move on, buddy; this isn’t for you.”</p>
   <p>Shakily, Doris caught his arm. “Harvey, this is the man I tried to serve today. Mr. Eggerton, this is my husband.”</p>
   <p>They shook hands icily. “Where is it?” Eggerton demanded bluntly. “You have it with you?”</p>
   <p>“Yes . . . it’s in my purse.” Doris moved away. “I’ll get it. You can come along, if you want.” She was regaining her composure. “I think I left it around here, somewhere. Harvey, where the hell’s my purse?” In the darkness she fumbled for something small and vaguely shiny. “Yes, here it is. On the bed.”</p>
   <p>She stood lighting a cigaret and watching, as Eggerton examined the twenty-four hour notice. “Why did you came back?” she asked. For the party she had changed to a knee-length silk shirt, copper bracelets, sandals, and a luminous flower in her hair. Now the flower drooped miserably; her shirt was wrinkled and unbuttoned, and she looked dead-tired. Leaning against the bedroom wall, cigaret between her stained lips, she said: “I don’t see that it makes any difference what you do. The notice will be out publicly in half an hour—your personal staff has already been notified. God, I’m exhausted.” She looked around impatiently for her husband. “Let’s get out of here,” she said to him, as he wandered up. “I have to go to work tomorrow.”</p>
   <p>“We haven’t seen it,” Harvey Sorrel answered sullenly.</p>
   <p>“The hell with it!” Doris grabbed her coat from the closet. “Why all this mystery? My God, we’ve been here five hours and he hasn’t trotted it out <emphasis>yet.</emphasis> Even if he’s perfected time travel or squared the circle I’m not interested, not this late.”</p>
   <p>As she pushed her way through the crowded livingroom, Eggerton hurried to catch up with her. “Listen to me,” he gasped. Holding onto her shoulder ho continued rapidly, “Townsand said if I came back I could throw myself on the mercy of the Agency. He said—”</p>
   <p>The girl shook loose. “Yes, of course; it’s the law.” She turned angrily to her husband who had scrambled after them. “Are you coming?”</p>
   <p>“I’m coming,” Harvey answered, bloodshot eyes blazing with indignation, “But I’m saying goodnight to Richards. And you’re going to tell him it’s <emphasis>your</emphasis> idea to leave; I’m not going to pretend it’s my fault we’re walking out. If you haven’t got the social decency at least to say goodnight to your host. . . .”</p>
   <p>The gray-haired man who had let Eggerton in broke away from a circle of guests and came smilingly over. “Harvey! Doris! Are you leaving? But you haven’t seen it.” Dismay flooded his heavy face. “You <emphasis>can’t</emphasis> leave.”</p>
   <p>Doris opened her mouth to say that she damn well could. “Look,” Harvey cut in desperately, “can’t you show it to us now? Come on, Jay; we’ve waited long enough.”</p>
   <p>Richards hesitated. More people were wearily getting up and clustering over. “Come on,” voices demanded, “let’s get it over with.”</p>
   <p>After a moment of indecision Richards conceded. “All right,” he agreed; he knew he had stalled long enough. Into the tired, experience-satiated guests a measure of anticipation trickled back. Richards raised his arms dramatically; he was still going to milk what he could from the moment. “This is it, folks! Come on along with me—it’s out back.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>“I wondered where it was,” Harvey said, following after his host. “Come on, Doris.” He seized her arm and dragged her after him. The others crowded along, through the diningroom, the kitchen, to the back door.</p>
   <p>The night was ice chill. Frigid wind blew around them as they shivered and stumbled uncertainly down the black steps, into the hyperborean gloom. John Eggerton felt a small shape push into him: as Doris savagely yanked away from her husband, Eggerton managed to follow after her. She rapidly shoved through the mass of guests, along the concrete walk to the fence that enclosed the yard. “Wait,” Eggerton gasped, “listen to me. Then the Agency will take me?” He was powerless to keep the thin edge of pleading from his voice. “I can count on that? The notice will be voided?”</p>
   <p>Doris sighed wearily. “That’s right. Okay, if you want, I’ll take you over to the Agency and get action on your papers; otherwise they’ll sit there for a month. You know what it means, I suppose. You’re indentured to the Agency for the balance of your natural life; you know that, I suppose. Do you?”</p>
   <p>“I know.”</p>
   <p>“Do you want that?” She was distantly curious. “A man like you . . . I would have thought otherwise.”</p>
   <p>Eggerton twisted miserably. “Townsand said—” he began pathetically.</p>
   <p>“What I want to know,” Doris interrupted, “is why you didn’t respond to your first notice? If only you’d come around . . . this never would have happened.”</p>
   <p>Eggerton opened his mouth to answer. He was going to say something about the principle involved, the concept of a free society, the rights of the individual, liberty and due process, the encroachment of the state. It was at that moment that Richards snapped on the powerful outdoor searchlights he had rigged up especially for the occasion; for the first time, his great achievement was revealed for everyone to see.</p>
   <p>For a moment there was stunned silence. Then all at once they were screaming and milling from the yard. Wild-faced, dazed with terror, they scrambled over the fence, burst through the plastic wall surrounding the yard, crashed into the next yard and onto the public street.</p>
   <empty-line/>

   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Richards stood dumbfounded beside his masterpiece, bewildered and not yet understanding. In the artificial white glare of the searchlights the high-velocity transport was a thing of utter beauty. It was fully formed completely ripe. Half an hour before, Richards had slipped outside with a flashlight, inspected it, and then, trembling with excitement, had cut the stem from which the ship had grown. It was now separate from the plant on which it had formed; he had rolled it to the edge of the yard, filled the fuel tank, slid back the hatch, and made it ready for flight.</p>
   <p>On the plant were the embryonic buds of other transports, in various stages of growth. He had watered and fertilized with skill: the plant was going to turn out half a dozen jet transports before the end of the summer.</p>
   <p>Tears dribbled down Doris’ tired cheeks. “You see it?” she whispered wretchedly to Eggerton. “It’s—lovely. Look at it; see it sitting there?” Agonized, she turned away. “Poor Jay . . . when he understands . . .”</p>
   <p>Richards stood, feet planted apart, gazing around at the deserted, trampled remains of his yard. He made out the shapes of Eggerton and Doris; after a moment he started hesitantly toward them. “Doris,” he choked brokenly, <emphasis>“what is it?</emphasis> What did I do?”</p>
   <p>Suddenly his expression changed. Bewilderment vanished; first came brute, naked terror as finally he understood what he was, and why his guests had fled. And then crazed cunning fell into place. Richards turned clumsily and began lumbering across the yard toward his ship.</p>
   <p>Eggerton killed him with a single shot at the base of the skull. As Doris began screaming shrilly, he shot out the searchlights one by one. The yard, Richards’s body, the gleaming metal transport, dissolved in the frigid gloom. He shoved the girl down and forced her face into the wet, cold vines growing up the wall of the garden.</p>
   <p>She was able to get hold of herself, after a time. Shuddering, she lay pressed against the mashed grass and vines, arms clutched around her waist, trembling back and forth in an aimless rocking motion that gradually drained Itself away.</p>
   <p>Eggerton helped her up. “All these years and nobody suspected. He was saving it up—his big secret.”</p>
   <p>“You’ll be all right,” Doris was saying, so low and faint that he could hardly hear her. “The Agency will be willing to write you off; you stopped him.” Weak with shock, she groped blindly in the darkness for her scattered purse and cigarettes. “He would have got away. And that <emphasis>plant.</emphasis> What are we going to do with it?” She found her cigarets and lit up wildly. “What about it?”</p>
   <p>Their eyes were growing accustomed to the night gloom. Under the faint sheen of starlight the outline of the plant came dimly into focus. “It won’t live,” Eggerton said. “It’s part of his delusion; now he’s dead.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Frightened and subdued, the other guests were beginning to filter back into the yard. Harvey Sorrel crept drunkenly from the shadows and apologetically approached his wife. Somewhere far off the wail of a siren sounded; the automatic police had been called. “Do you want to come with us?” Doris asked Eggerton shakily. She indicated her husband. “We’ll all drive over to the Agency together and get you straightened out; it can be fixed up. There’ll be some kind of indenture, a few years at the most. Nothing more than that.”</p>
   <p>Eggerton moved away from her. “No thanks,” he said. “I have something else to do. Maybe later.”</p>
   <p>“But—”</p>
   <p>“I think I have what I want.” Eggerton fumbled for the back door and entered Richard’s deserted quarters. “This is what we’ve been looking for.”</p>
   <p>He put through his emergency call immediately. In Townsand’s apartment the buzzer was sounding within thirty seconds. Sleepily, Laura roused her husband; Eggerton began talking as soon as the two men were facing each other’s image.</p>
   <p>“We have our standard,” he said; “we don’t need the Agency. We can pull the rug out from under them because we don’t really need them to watch us.”</p>
   <p>“What?” Townsand demanded angrily, his mind fuzzy with sleep. “What are you talking about?”</p>
   <p>Eggerton repeated what he had said, as calmly as possible.</p>
   <p>“Then who <emphasis>will</emphasis> watch us?” Townsand growled. “What the hell is all this?”</p>
   <p>“We’ll watch each other,” Eggerton continued patiently. “Nobody will be exempt. Each of us will be the standard for the next man. Richards couldn’t see himself objectively, but I could—<emphasis>even though I’m not immune.</emphasis> We don’t need anybody over us, because we can do the job ourselves.”</p>
   <p>Townsand reflected resentfully. He yawned, pulled his night-robe around him glanced sleepily at his wristwatch. “Lord, it’s late. Maybe you have something, maybe not. Tell me more about this Richards . . . what sort of P-K talent did he have?”</p>
   <p>Eggerton told him. “You see? All these years . . . and he couldn’t tell. But we could tell instantly.” Eggerton’s voice rose excitedly. “We can run our own society, again! Consensus gentium—we’ve had our measuring standard all the time and none of us has realized it. Individually, each of us is fallible; <emphasis>but as a group we can’t go wrong.</emphasis> All we have to do is make sure the random check-nets get everybody; we’ll have to step the process up, get more people and get them o’ftener. It has to be accelerated so that everybody, sooner or later, gets hauled in.”</p>
   <p>“I see,” Townsand agreed.</p>
   <p>“We’ll keep the tame telepaths, of course; so we can get out all the thoughts and subliminal material. The teeps won’t evaluate; we’ll handle that ourselves.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Townsand nodded dully. “Sounds good, John.”</p>
   <p>“It came to me as soon as I saw Richards’ plant. It was instantaneous—I had complete certitude. How could there be error? A delusional system like his simply doesn’t fit into our world.” Eggerton’s hand slammed down on the table in front of him; a book that had belonged to Jay Richards slipped off and landed soundlessly on the thick carpet of the apartment. “You understand? There’s no equation between a P-K world and ours; all we have to do is get the P-K material up where we can see it. Where we can compare it to our own reality.”</p>
   <p>Townsand was silent a moment. “All right,” he said at last. “Come on over. If you convince the rest of the id bloc then we’ll act.” He made his decision. “I’ll get them out of bed and over here.”</p>
   <p>“Fine.” Eggerton reached quickly for the cut-off switch. “I’ll hurry over; and thanks!”</p>
   <p>He rushed from the littered, bottlestrewn apartment, now dismal and deserted without the celebrating guests. In the backyard, the police were already picking around, examining the dying plant that Jay Richards’ delusional talent had brought into momentary existence.</p>
   <p>The night air was cold and crisp, as Eggerton emerged from the ascent ramp, onto the roof field of the Commerce Building. A few voices drifted up from far below; the roof itself was deserted. He buttoned his heavy overcoat around him, extended his arms, and rose from the roof. He gained altitude and speed; in a few moments he was on his way toward Pittsburgh.</p>
   <p>As he flew silently through the night he gulped vast lungfuls of the clean, fresh air. Satisfaction and rising excitement raced through him. He had spotted Richards immediately—and why not? How could he miss? A man who grew jet transports from a plant in his backyard was clearly a lunatic.</p>
   <p>It was so much simpler just to flap one’s arms.</p>
